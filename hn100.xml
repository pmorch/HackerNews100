<h3>Reporting Highlights</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Chokeholds:</strong> We found over 40 cases of agents using chokeholds and other moves that can block breathing. “I felt like I was going to pass out and die,” said a 16-year-old citizen.</li>



<li><strong>Former Police Are Appalled:</strong> We showed former police and immigration officials videos of incidents. They said agents are out of control. One said it’s “the kind of action which should get you fired.”</li>



<li><strong>Banned Tactics, No Punishment:</strong> There is a federal ban on chokeholds and similar tactics. But there is no sign of punishment for officers who’ve used them.</li>
</ul>



<p>These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.</p>

<p>Immigration agents have put civilians’ lives at risk using more than their guns.</p>



<p>An agent in Houston put a teenage citizen into a chokehold, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQUtnnViSSc/?hl=en">wrapping his arm around the boy’s neck</a>, choking him so hard that his neck had red welts hours later. A black-masked agent in Los Angeles pressed his knee into a woman’s neck while she was handcuffed; she then appeared to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@trendy_viewz_1/video/7539167585011551501">pass out</a>. An agent in Massachusetts jabbed his finger and thumb into the neck and arteries of a young father who refused to be separated from his wife and 1-year-old daughter. The man’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy-q83KCOZw">eyes rolled back in his head and he started convulsing</a>.</p>



<p>After George Floyd’s murder by a police officer six years ago in Minneapolis — less than a mile from where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed Renee Good last week — police departments and federal agencies banned chokeholds and other moves that can restrict breathing or blood flow.</p>



<p>But those tactics are back, now at the hands of agents conducting President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign.</p>



<p>Examples are scattered across social media. ProPublica found more than 40 cases over the past year of immigration agents using these life-threatening maneuvers on immigrants, citizens and protesters. The agents are usually masked, their identities secret. The government won’t say if any of them have been punished.</p>



<p>In nearly 20 cases, agents appeared to use chokeholds and other neck restraints that the Department of Homeland Security prohibits “<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/23_0206_s1_use-of-force-policy-update.pdf">unless deadly force is authorized</a>.”</p>




<p>About two dozen videos show officers kneeling on people’s necks or backs or keeping them face down on the ground while already handcuffed. Such tactics are not prohibited outright but are often discouraged, including by federal trainers, in part because using them for a prolonged time risks asphyxiation.</p>



<p>We reviewed footage with a panel of eight former police officers and law enforcement experts. They were appalled.</p>



<p>This is what bad policing looks like, they said. And it puts everyone at risk.</p>



<p>“I arrested dozens upon dozens of drug traffickers, human smugglers, child molesters — some of them will resist,” said Eric Balliet, who spent more than two decades working at Homeland Security Investigations and Border Patrol, including in the first Trump administration. “I don’t remember putting anybody in a chokehold. Period.”</p>



<p>“If this was one of my officers, he or she would be facing discipline,” said Gil Kerlikowske, a longtime police chief in Seattle who also served as Customs and Border Protection commissioner under President Barack Obama. “You have these guys running around in fatigues, with masks, with ‘Police’ on their uniform,” but they aren’t acting like professional police.</p>



<p>Over the past week, the conduct of agents has come under intense scrutiny after an ICE officer in Minneapolis killed Good, a mother of three. The next day, a Border Patrol agent in Portland, Oregon, <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2026/01/portland-police-responding-to-report-of-shooting-by-federal-immigration-agent.html">shot a man and woman</a> in a hospital parking lot.</p>



<p>Top administration officials rushed to defend the officers. Speaking about the agent who shot Good, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said, “This is an experienced officer who followed his training.”</p>



<p>Officials said the same thing to us after we showed them footage of officers using prohibited chokeholds. Federal agents have “followed their training to use the least amount of force necessary,” department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.</p>



<p>“Officers act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.</p>



<p>Both DHS and the White House lauded the “utmost professionalism” of their agents.</p>



<p>Our compilation of incidents is far from complete. Just as the government does not count <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will">how often it detains citizens</a> or <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/trump-ice-smashed-windows-deportation-arrests/">smashes through vehicle windows</a> during immigration arrests, it does not publicly track how many times agents have choked civilians or otherwise inhibited their breathing or blood flow. We gathered cases by searching legal filings, social media posts and local press reports in English and Spanish.</p>



<p>Given the lack of any count over time, it’s impossible to know for certain how agents’ current use of the banned and dangerous tactics compares with earlier periods.</p>




<p>But former immigration officials told us they rarely heard of such incidents during their long tenures. They also recalled little pushback when DHS formally banned chokeholds and other tactics in 2023; it was merely codifying the norm.</p>



<p>That norm has now been broken.</p>



<h3>One of the citizens whom agents put in a chokehold was 16 years old.</h3>

<p>Tenth grader Arnoldo Bazan and his father were getting McDonald’s before school when their car was pulled over by unmarked vehicles. Masked immigration agents started banging on their windows. As Arnoldo’s undocumented father, Arnulfo Bazan Carrillo, drove off, the terrified teenager began filming on his phone. The video shows the agents repeatedly ramming the Bazans’ car during a slow chase through the city.</p>



<p>Bazan Carrillo eventually parked and ran into a restaurant supply store. When Arnoldo saw agents taking his father violently to the ground, Arnoldo went inside too, yelling at the agents to stop.</p>



<p>One agent put Arnoldo in a chokehold while another pressed a knee into his father’s neck. “I was going to school!” the boy pleaded. He said later that when he told the agent he was a citizen and a minor, the agent didn’t stop.</p>



<p>“I started screaming with everything I had, because I couldn’t even breathe,” Arnoldo told ProPublica, showing where the agent’s hands had closed around his throat. “I felt like I was going to pass out and die.”</p>



<p>DHS’ McLaughlin accused Arnoldo’s dad of ramming his car “into a federal law enforcement vehicle,” but he was never charged for that, and the videos we reviewed do not support this claim. Our examination of his criminal history — separate from any immigration violations — found only that Bazan Carrillo pleaded guilty a decade ago to misdemeanor driving while intoxicated.</p>



<p>McLaughlin also said the younger Bazan elbowed an officer in the face as he was detained, which the teen denies. She said that Arnoldo was taken into custody to confirm his identity and make sure he didn’t have any weapons. McLaughlin did not answer whether the agent’s conduct was justified.</p>



<p>Experts who reviewed video of the Bazans’ arrests could make no sense of the agents’ actions.</p>



<p>“Why are you in the middle of a store trying to grab somebody?” said Marc Brown, a former police officer turned instructor who taught ICE and Border Patrol officers at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers. “Your arm underneath the neck, like a choking motion? No! The knee on the neck? Absolutely not.”</p>



<p>DHS revamped its training curriculum after George Floyd’s murder to underscore those tactics were out of bounds, Brown said. “DHS specifically was very big on no choking,” he said. “We don’t teach that. They were, like, hardcore against it. They didn’t want to see anything with the word ‘choke.’”</p>



<h3>After agents used another banned neck restraint — a carotid hold — a man started convulsing and passed out.</h3>

<p>In early November, ICE agents in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, stopped a young father, Carlos Sebastian Zapata Rivera, as he drove with his family. They had come for his undocumented wife, whom they targeted after she was charged with assault for allegedly stabbing a co-worker in the hand with scissors.</p>




<p>Body camera footage from the local police, obtained by ProPublica, captured much of what happened. The couple’s 1-year-old daughter began crying. Agents surrounded the car, looking in through open doors.</p>



<p>According to the footage, an agent told Zapata Rivera that if his wife wouldn’t come out, they would have to arrest him, too — and their daughter would be sent into the foster system. The agent recounted the conversation to a local cop: “Technically, I can arrest both of you,” he said. “If you no longer have a child, because the child is now in state custody, you’re both gonna be arrested. Do you want to give your child to the state?”</p>



<p>Zapata Rivera, who has a pending asylum claim, clung to his family. His wife kept saying she wouldn’t go anywhere without her daughter, whom she said was still breastfeeding. Zapata Rivera wouldn’t let go of either of them.</p>



<p>Federal agents seemed conflicted on how to proceed. “I refuse to have us videotaped throwing someone to the ground while they have a child in their hands,” one ICE agent told a police officer at the scene.</p>



<p>But after more than an hour, agents held down Zapata Rivera’s arms. One, who Zapata Rivera’s lawyer says wore a baseball cap reading “Ne Quis Effugiat” — Latin for “So That None Will Escape” — pressed his thumbs into the arteries on Zapata Rivera’s neck. The young man then appeared to pass out as bystanders screamed.</p>



<p>The technique is known as a carotid restraint. The two carotid arteries carry 70% of the brain’s blood flow; block them, and a person can quickly lose consciousness. The tactic can cause <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2774482">strokes, seizures, brain damage — and death</a>.</p>



<p>“Even milliseconds or seconds of interrupted blood flow to the brain can have serious consequences,” Dr. Altaf Saadi, a neurologist and associate professor at Harvard Medical School, told us. Saadi said she couldn’t comment on specific cases, “but there is no amount of training or method of applying pressure on the neck that is foolproof in terms of avoiding neurologic damage.”</p>



<p>In a bystander video of Zapata Rivera’s arrest, his eyes roll back in his head and he suffers an apparent seizure, convulsing so violently that his daughter, seated in his lap, shakes with him.</p>



<figure><video controls="" poster="https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Newsflare-807969-distressing-moment-man-appears-fallback_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95.jpg" src="https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Newsflare-807969-distressing-moment-man-appears-1_2.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption><span>Video of Zapata Rivera’s arrest shows him shaking violently while suffering an apparent seizure in the front seat of his car, with officers continuing to attempt the arrest.</span> <span>Newsflare</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“Carotid restraints are prohibited unless deadly force is authorized,” DHS’ <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/23_0206_s1_use-of-force-policy-update.pdf">use-of-force policy</a> states. Deadly force is authorized only when an officer believes there’s an “imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury” and there is “no alternative.”</p>



<p>In a social media post after the incident and in its statement to ProPublica, DHS did not cite a deadly threat. Instead, it referenced the charges against Zapata Rivera’s wife and suggested <a href="https://x.com/dhsgov/status/1986881395432820927">he had only pretended to have a medical crisis</a> while refusing help from paramedics. “Imagine FAKING a seizure to help a criminal escape justice,” the post said.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/72041374/zapata-rivera-v-unknown-federal-agent-john-doe/">“These statements were lies,”</a> Zapata Rivera alleges in an ongoing civil rights lawsuit he filed against the ICE agent who used the carotid restraint. His lawyer told ProPublica that Zapata Rivera was disoriented after regaining consciousness; the lawsuit says he was denied medical attention. (Representatives for Zapata Rivera declined our requests for an interview with him. His wife has been released on bond, and her assault case awaits trial.)</p>



<p>A police report and bodycam footage from Fitchburg officers at the scene, obtained via a public records request, back up Zapata Rivera’s account of being denied assistance. “He’s fine,” an agent told paramedics, according to footage. The police report says Zapata Rivera wanted medical attention but “agents continued without stopping.”</p>




<p>Saadi, the Harvard neurologist, said that as a general matter, determining whether someone had a seizure is “not something even neurologists can do accurately just by looking at it.”</p>



<h3>DHS policy bars using chokeholds and carotid restraints just because someone is resisting arrest. Agents are doing it anyway.</h3>

<p>When DHS issued restrictions on chokeholds and carotid restraints, it stated that the moves “must not be used as a means to control non-compliant subjects or persons resisting arrest.” Deadly force “shall not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing subject.”</p>



<p>But videos reviewed by ProPublica show that agents have been using these restraints to do just that.</p>



<p>In Los Angeles in June, masked officers from ICE, Border Patrol and other federal agencies pepper-sprayed and then tackled another citizen, Luis Hipolito. As Hipolito struggled to get away, one of the agents put him in a chokehold. Another pointed a Taser at bystanders filming.</p>



<p>Then Hipolito’s body began to convulse — a possible seizure. An onlooker warned the agents, “You gonna let him die.”</p>



<figure><video controls="" poster="https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LuisHipolito-fallback_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95.jpg" src="https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/LuisHipolito.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption><span>In the video of Hipolito’s arrest, four agents can be seen pulling at his body, choking him and pinning him to the pavement.</span> <span>@the_moxie_report</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>When officers make a mistake in the heat of the moment, said Danny Murphy, a former deputy commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department, they need to “correct it as quickly as possible.”</p>



<p>That didn’t happen in Hipolito’s case. The footage shows the immigration agent not only wrapping his arm around Hipolito’s neck as he takes him down but also sticking with the chokehold after Hipolito is pinned on the ground.</p>



<p>The agent’s actions are “dangerous and unreasonable,” Murphy said.</p>



<p>Asked about the case, McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said that Hipolito was arrested for assaulting an ICE officer. Hipolito’s lawyers did not respond to ProPublica’s requests for comment.</p>



<p>According to the Los Angeles Times, Hipolito <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-27/are-you-gonna-let-him-die-agents-pile-on-protester-who-convulses-and-struggles-to-breathe">limped into court days after the incident</a>. Another citizen who was with him the day of the incident was also charged, but her case was dropped. Hipolito pleaded not guilty and goes to trial in February.</p>



<h3>Some of the conduct in the footage isn’t banned — but it’s discouraged and dangerous.</h3>

<p>A video from Los Angeles shows a Colombian-born TikTokker who often filmed ICE apparently <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@trendy_viewz_1/video/7539167585011551501">passed out</a> after officers <a href="https://x.com/WUTangKids/status/1956854632203878890">pulled her from her Tesla and knelt on her neck</a>. Another video shows a DoorDash driver in Portland, Oregon, <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2025/10/i-cant-breathe-man-tells-ice-agents-in-spanish-five-times-during-portland-arrest.html">screaming for air as four officers pin him face down in the street</a>. “Aire, aire, aire,”<em> </em>he says. “No puedo respirar” — I can’t breathe. Then: “Estoy muriendo”<em> </em>— I’m dying. A third video, from Chicago, <a href="https://spaces.hightail.com/space/ERClkyY4Cj/files/fi-ee68b78b-2ba0-4355-b2a1-49e1d5243c7c/fv-946d3e13-2b8d-4317-bb54-fbe69fd3ef09/2025.10.31.MP4">shows an agent straddling a citizen and repeatedly pressing his face into the asphalt</a>. Onlookers yell that the man can’t breathe.</p>



<p>Placing a knee on a prone subject’s neck or weight on their back isn’t banned under DHS’ use-of-force policy, but it can be dangerous — and the longer it goes on, the higher the risk that the person won’t be able to breathe.</p>




<p>“You really don’t want to spend that amount of time just trying to get somebody handcuffed,” said Kerlikowske, the former CPB commissioner, of the video of the arrest in Portland.</p>



<p>Brown, the former federal instructor and now a lead police trainer at the University of South Carolina, echoed that. “Once you get them handcuffed, you get them up, get them out of there,” he said. “If they’re saying they can’t breathe, hurry up.”</p>

<p>Taking a person down to the ground and restraining them there can be an appropriate way to get them in handcuffs, said Seth Stoughton, a former police officer turned law professor who also works at the University of South Carolina. But officers have long known to make it quick. By the mid-1990s, the federal government was advising officers against keeping people prolongedly in a prone position.</p>



<p>When a federal agent kneeled on the neck of an intensive care nurse in August, she said she understood the danger she was in and tried to scream.</p>



<p>“I knew that the amount of pressure being placed on the back of my neck could definitely hurt me,” said Amanda Trebach, a citizen and activist who was arrested in Los Angeles while monitoring immigration agents. “I was having a hard time breathing because my chest was on the ground.”</p>



<p>McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said Trebach impeded agents’ vehicles and struck them with her signs and fists.</p>



<p>Trebach denies this. She was released without any charges.</p>

<p>In the fall, a protester in Chicago refused to stand back after a federal agent told him to do so. Suddenly, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/51miOmd1qUM">agent grabbed the man by the throat and slammed him to the ground</a>.</p>



<p>“No, no!” one bystander exclaims. “He’s not doing anything!”</p>



<p>DHS’ McLaughlin did not respond to questions about the incident.</p>



<p>Along with two <a href="https://x.com/fordfischer/status/1969150886422155594">similar</a> <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ice-throw-elderly-woman-to-the-ground_n_690271b2e4b0e763a61c8a22">choking incidents</a> at protests outside of ICE facilities, this is one of the few videos in which the run-up to the violence is clear. And the experts were aghast.</p>



<p>“Without anything I could see as even remotely a deadly force threat, he immediately goes for the throat,” said Ashley Heiberger, a retired police captain from Pennsylvania who frequently testifies in use-of-force cases. Balliet, the former immigration official, said the agent turned the scene into a “pissing contest” that was “explicitly out of control.”</p>




<p>“It’s so clearly excessive and ridiculous,” Murphy said. “That’s the kind of action which should get you fired.”</p>



<p>“How big a threat did you think he was?” Brown said, noting that the officer slung his rifle around his back before grabbing and body-slamming the protester. “You can’t go grab someone just because they say, ‘F the police.’”</p>



<h3>Roving patrols + unplanned arrests = unsafe tactics.</h3>

<p>In November, Border Patrol agents rushed into the construction site of a future Panda Express in Charlotte, North Carolina, to check workers’ papers. When one man tried to run, an officer put him in a chokehold and later marched him out, bloodied, to a waiting SUV.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/11/15/dhs-launches-operation-charlottes-web-target-criminal-illegal-aliens-terrorizing">Charlotte operation</a> was one of Border Patrol’s many forays into American cities, as agents led by <a href="https://x.com/CMDROpAtLargeCA/status/1995599514078732776?s=20">commander-at-large Gregory Bovino</a> claimed to target “criminal illegal aliens” but frequently <a href="https://x.com/CMDROpAtLargeCA/status/1995599514078732776?s=20">chased down</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuaPCS67Ii8">landscapers</a>, construction workers and <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article312950879.html">U.S. citizens</a> in roving patrols through predominantly immigrant or Latino communities.</p>



<p>Freelance photographer <a href="https://www.ryanmurphyphoto.com/bio">Ryan Murphy</a>, who had been following Border Patrol’s convoys around Charlotte, documented the Panda Express arrest.</p>



<p>“Their tactics are less sophisticated than you would think,” he told ProPublica. “They sort of drive along the streets, and if they see somebody who looks to them like they could potentially be undocumented, they pull over.”</p>



<p>Experts told ProPublica that if officers are targeting a specific individual, they can minimize risks by deciding when, where and how to take them into custody. But when they don’t know their target in advance, chaos — and abuse — can follow.</p>



<p>“They are encountering people they don’t know anything about,” said Scott Shuchart, a former assistant director at ICE.</p>



<p>“The stuff that I’ve been seeing in the videos,” Kerlikowske said, “has been just ragtag, random.”</p>



<p>There may be other factors, too, our experts said, including quotas and a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/homeland-security-crcl-civil-rights-immigration-border-patrol-trump-kristi-noem">lack of consequences amid gutted oversight</a>. With officers wearing masks, Shuchart said, “even if they punch grandma in the face, they won’t be identified.”</p>



<p>As they sweep into American cities, immigration officers are unconstrained — and, the experts said, unprepared. Even well-trained officers may not be trained for the environments where they now operate. Patrolling a little-populated border region takes one set of skills. Working in urban areas, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-agents-detained-mistreated-citizens-congressional-investigation">where citizens — and protesters — abound</a>, takes another.</p>



<p>DHS and Bovino did not respond to questions about their agents’ preparation or about the chokehold in Charlotte.</p>




<h3>Experts may think there’s abuse. But holding officers to account? That’s another matter.</h3>

<p>Back in Houston, immigration officers dropped 16-year-old Arnoldo off at the doorstep of his family home a few hours after the arrest. His neck was bruised, and his new shirt was shredded. Videos taken by his older sisters show the soccer star struggling to speak through sobs.</p>



<p>Uncertain what exactly had happened to him, his sister Maria Bazan took him to Texas Children’s Hospital, where staff identified signs of the chokehold and moved him to the trauma unit. Hospital records show he was given morphine for pain and that doctors ordered a dozen CT scans and X-rays, including of his neck, spine and head.</p>



<p>From the hospital, Maria called the Houston Police Department and tried to file a report, the family said. After several unsuccessful attempts, she took Arnoldo to the department in person, where she says officers were skeptical of the account and their own ability to investigate federal agents.</p>



<p>Arnoldo had filmed much of the incident, but agents had taken his phone. He used Find My to locate the phone — at a vending machine for used electronics miles away, close to an ICE detention center. The footage, which ProPublica has reviewed, backed the family’s account of the chase.</p>

<p>The family says Houston police still haven’t interviewed them. A department spokesperson told ProPublica it was not investigating the case, referring questions to DHS. But the police have also not released bodycam footage and case files aside from a top sheet, citing an open investigation.</p>



<p>“We can’t do anything,” Maria said one officer told her. “What can HPD do to federal agents?”</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the country, some officials are trying to hold federal immigration officers to account.</p>



<p>In California, the state Legislature passed bills prohibiting immigration officers from wearing masks and requiring them to display identification during operations.</p>



<p>In Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker signed a law that allows residents to sue any officer who violates state or federal constitutional rights. (The Trump administration quickly filed legal challenges against California and Illinois, claiming their new laws are unconstitutional.)</p>



<p>In Colorado, Durango’s police chief saw a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St5aTGJd4Rw">video of an immigration officer using a chokehold on a protester</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/us/politics/durango-colorado-ice-protester.html">reported it to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation</a>, which announced it was looking into the incident.</p>



<p>In Minnesota, state and local leaders are collecting evidence in Renee Good’s killing even as the federal government <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/08/fbi-will-investigate-after-ice-agent-shoots-renee-good-in-minneapolis">cut the state out</a> of its investigation.</p>



<p>Arnoldo is still waiting for Houston authorities to help him, still terrified that a masked agent will come first. Amid soccer practice and making up schoolwork he missed while recovering, he watches and rewatches the videos from that day. The car chase, the chokehold, his own screams at the officers to leave his dad alone. His father in the driver’s seat, calmly handing Arnoldo his wallet and phone while stopping mid-chase for red lights.</p>




<p>The Bazan family said agents threatened to charge Arnoldo if his dad didn’t agree to be deported. DHS spokesperson McLaughlin did not respond when asked about the alleged threat. Arnoldo’s dad is now in Mexico.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asked why an officer choked Arnoldo, McLaughlin pointed to the boy’s alleged assault with his elbow, adding, “The federal law enforcement officer graciously chose not to press charges.”</p>



<h3>How We Did It</h3>



<p>ProPublica journalists Nicole Foy, McKenzie Funk, Joanna Shan, Haley Clark and Cengiz Yar gathered videos via Spanish and English social media posts, local press reports and court records. We then sent a selection of these videos to eight police experts and former immigration officials, along with as much information as we could gather about the lead-up to and context of each incident. The experts analyzed the videos with us, explaining when and how officers used dangerous tactics that appeared to go against their training or that have been banned under the Department of Homeland Security’s use-of-force policy.</p>



<p>We also tried to contact every person we could identify being choked or kneeled on. In some cases, we also reached out to bystanders.</p>



<p>Research reporter Mariam Elba conducted criminal record searches of every person we featured in this story. She also attempted to fact-check the allegations that DHS made about the civilians and their arrests. Our findings are not comprehensive because there is no universal criminal record database.</p>



<p>We also sent every video cited in this story to the White House, DHS, CBP, ICE, border czar Tom Homan and Border Patrol’s Gregory Bovino. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin provided a statement responding to some of the incidents we found but she did not explain why agents used banned tactics or whether any of the agents have been disciplined for doing so.</p>

<div><p>The old lesson from the Wizard of Oz experiment says that a regular expression probably <i>isn't</i> too crude, if you're willing to take the time to design it. Though you could <i>probably</i> get away with running a regex golf algorithm (e.g. <a href="https://nbviewer.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/xkcd1313.ipynb" rel="nofollow">https://nbviewer.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/xkcd1313.ipynb</a>) over the list of matching titles, and the union of some list of non-matching-but-close titles (chosen to get good discrimination) with some list of way-off titles (to avoid overfitting). (You <i>could</i> treat the whole HN title database, other than the ones you've identified, as losers, but that risks hardcoding the absence of a post you accidentally missed, and would also take slightly longer – though Peter Norvig's first algorithm takes time linear in the number of losers, so it might not be too expensive. I don't know how expensive his improved versions are, given large lists of losers: <a href="https://nbviewer.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/xkcd1313-part2.ipynb" rel="nofollow">https://nbviewer.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/xkcd1313-part2.i...</a>.

The "Show New" (two clicks away) probably gets tinier, miniscule fraction of clicks.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>I have a habit of skimming the OpenJDK commit log every few weeks. Many commits are too complex for me to grasp in the limited time I have reserved for this ... <em>special hobby</em>. But occasionally something catches my eye.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/858d2e434dd">this commit</a> stopped me mid-scroll:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>858d2e434dd 8372584: [Linux]: Replace reading proc to get thread CPU</span></p><p><span>time with clock_gettime</span></p></pre></div>
<p>The diffstat was interesting: <code>+96 insertions, -54 deletions</code>. The changeset adds a 55-line JMH benchmark, which means the production code itself is actually reduced.</p>
<h2 id="the-deleted-code"><a href="#the-deleted-code">The Deleted Code</a></h2>
<p>Here's what got removed from <code>os_linux.cpp</code>:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>static jlong user_thread_cpu_time(Thread *thread) {</span></p><p><span>  pid_t  tid = thread-&gt;osthread()-&gt;thread_id();</span></p><p><span>  char *s;</span></p><p><span>  char stat[2048];</span></p><p><span>  size_t statlen;</span></p><p><span>  char proc_name[64];</span></p><p><span>  int count;</span></p><p><span>  long sys_time, user_time;</span></p><p><span>  char cdummy;</span></p><p><span>  int idummy;</span></p><p><span>  long ldummy;</span></p><p><span>  FILE *fp;</span></p><p><span>  os::snprintf_checked(proc_name, 64, "/proc/self/task/%d/stat", tid);</span></p><p><span>  fp = os::fopen(proc_name, "r");</span></p><p><span>  if (fp == nullptr) return -1;</span></p><p><span>  statlen = fread(stat, 1, 2047, fp);</span></p><p><span>  stat[statlen] = '\0';</span></p><p><span>  fclose(fp);</span></p><p><span>  // Skip pid and the command string. Note that we could be dealing with</span></p><p><span>  // weird command names, e.g. user could decide to rename java launcher</span></p><p><span>  // to "java 1.4.2 :)", then the stat file would look like</span></p><p><span>  //                1234 (java 1.4.2 :)) R ... ...</span></p><p><span>  // We don't really need to know the command string, just find the last</span></p><p><span>  // occurrence of ")" and then start parsing from there. See bug 4726580.</span></p><p><span>  s = strrchr(stat, ')');</span></p><p><span>  if (s == nullptr) return -1;</span></p><p><span>  // Skip blank chars</span></p><p><span>  do { s++; } while (s &amp;&amp; isspace((unsigned char) *s));</span></p><p><span>  count = sscanf(s,"%c %d %d %d %d %d %lu %lu %lu %lu %lu %lu %lu",</span></p><p><span>                 &amp;cdummy, &amp;idummy, &amp;idummy, &amp;idummy, &amp;idummy, &amp;idummy,</span></p><p><span>                 &amp;ldummy, &amp;ldummy, &amp;ldummy, &amp;ldummy, &amp;ldummy,</span></p><p><span>                 &amp;user_time, &amp;sys_time);</span></p><p><span>  if (count != 13) return -1;</span></p><p><span>  return (jlong)user_time * (1000000000 / os::Posix::clock_tics_per_second());</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></pre></div>
<p>This was the implementation behind <code>ThreadMXBean.getCurrentThreadUserTime()</code>. To get the current thread's user CPU time, the old code was:</p>
<ol>
<li>Formatting a path to <code>/proc/self/task/&lt;tid&gt;/stat</code></li>
<li>Opening that file</li>
<li>Reading into a stack buffer</li>
<li>Parsing through a hostile format where the command name can contain parentheses (hence the <code>strrchr</code> for the last <code>)</code>)</li>
<li>Running <code>sscanf</code> to extract fields 13 and 14</li>
<li>Converting clock ticks to nanoseconds</li>
</ol>
<p>For comparison, here's what <code>getCurrentThreadCpuTime()</code> does and has always done:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>jlong os::current_thread_cpu_time() {</span></p><p><span>  return os::Linux::thread_cpu_time(CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID);</span></p><p><span>}</span></p><p><span>jlong os::Linux::thread_cpu_time(clockid_t clockid) {</span></p><p><span>  struct timespec tp;</span></p><p><span>  clock_gettime(clockid, &amp;tp);</span></p><p><span>  return (jlong)(tp.tv_sec * NANOSECS_PER_SEC + tp.tv_nsec);</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></pre></div>
<p>Just a single <code>clock_gettime()</code> call. There is no file I/O, no complex parsing and no buffer to manage.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8210452">original bug report</a>, filed back in 2018, quantified the difference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"getCurrentThreadUserTime is 30x-400x slower than getCurrentThreadCpuTime"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gap widens under concurrency. Why is <code>clock_gettime()</code> so much faster? Both approaches require kernel entry, but the difference is in what happens next.</p>
<p><strong>The <code>/proc</code> path:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>open()</code> syscall</li>
<li>VFS dispatch + dentry lookup</li>
<li>procfs synthesizes file content at read time</li>
<li>kernel formats string into buffer</li>
<li><code>read()</code> syscall, copy to userspace</li>
<li>userspace <code>sscanf()</code> parsing</li>
<li><code>close()</code> syscall</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The <code>clock_gettime(CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID)</code> path:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>single syscall → <code>posix_cpu_clock_get()</code> → <code>cpu_clock_sample()</code> → <code>task_sched_runtime()</code> → reads directly from <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/8449d3252c2603a51ffc7c36cb5bd94874378b7d/include/linux/sched.h#L586"><code>sched_entity</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>/proc</code> path involves multiple syscalls, VFS machinery, string formatting kernel-side, and parsing userspace-side. The <code>clock_gettime()</code> path is one syscall with a direct function call chain.</p>
<p>Under concurrent load, the <code>/proc</code> approach also suffers from kernel lock contention. The <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8372584">bug report</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Reading proc is slow (hence why this procedure is put under the method slow_thread_cpu_time(...)) and may lead to noticeable spikes in case of contention for kernel resources."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-two-implementations?"><a href="#why-two-implementations?">Why Two Implementations?</a></h2>
<p>So why didn't <code>getCurrentThreadUserTime()</code> just use <code>clock_gettime()</code> from the start?</p>
<p>The answer is (probably) POSIX. The standard mandates that <code>CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID</code> returns total CPU time (user + system). There's no portable way to request user time only. Hence the <code>/proc</code>-based implementation.</p>
<p>The Linux port of OpenJDK isn't limited to what POSIX defines, it can use Linux-specific features. Let's see how.</p>
<h2 id="the-clockid-bit-hack"><a href="#the-clockid-bit-hack">The Clockid Bit Hack</a></h2>
<p>Linux kernels since 2.6.12 (released in 2005) <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/eee51b0ae5c52a77ed65ad59b55002d1397b40d5/include/linux/posix-timers_types.h#L10-L19">encode clock type information directly</a> into the <code>clockid_t</code> value. When you call <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_getcpuclockid.3.html"><code>pthread_getcpuclockid()</code></a>, you get back a clockid with a specific bit pattern:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>Bit 2:    Thread vs process clock</span></p><p><span>Bits 1-0: Clock type</span></p><p><span>  00 = PROF</span></p><p><span>  01 = VIRT  (user time only)</span></p><p><span>  10 = SCHED (user + system, POSIX-compliant)</span></p><p><span>  11 = FD</span></p></pre></div>
<p>The remaining bits encode the target PID/TID. We’ll come back to that in the bonus section.</p>
<p>The POSIX-compliant <code>pthread_getcpuclockid()</code> returns a clockid with bits <code>10</code> (SCHED). But if you flip those low bits to <code>01</code> (VIRT), <code>clock_gettime()</code> will return user time only.</p>
<p>The new implementation:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>static bool get_thread_clockid(Thread* thread, clockid_t* clockid, bool total) {</span></p><p><span>  constexpr clockid_t CLOCK_TYPE_MASK = 3;</span></p><p><span>  constexpr clockid_t CPUCLOCK_VIRT = 1;</span></p><p><span>  int rc = pthread_getcpuclockid(thread-&gt;osthread()-&gt;pthread_id(), clockid);</span></p><p><span>  if (rc != 0) {</span></p><p><span>    // Thread may have terminated</span></p><p><span>    assert_status(rc == ESRCH, rc, "pthread_getcpuclockid failed");</span></p><p><span>    return false;</span></p><p><span>  }</span></p><p><span>  if (!total) {</span></p><p><span>    // Flip to CPUCLOCK_VIRT for user-time-only</span></p><p><span>    *clockid = (*clockid &amp; ~CLOCK_TYPE_MASK) | CPUCLOCK_VIRT;</span></p><p><span>  }</span></p><p><span>  return true;</span></p><p><span>}</span></p><p><span>static jlong user_thread_cpu_time(Thread *thread) {</span></p><p><span>  clockid_t clockid;</span></p><p><span>  bool success = get_thread_clockid(thread, &amp;clockid, false);</span></p><p><span>  return success ? os::Linux::thread_cpu_time(clockid) : -1;</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></pre></div>
<p>And that's it. The new version has no file I/O, no buffer and certainly no <code>sscanf()</code> with thirteen format specifiers.</p>

<p>Let's have a look at how it performs in practice.

<p>Aside: This is a rather unscientific benchmark, I have other processes running on my desktop etc. Anyway, here is the setup: Ryzen 9950X, JDK main branch at commit <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/8ab7d3b89f656e5c">8ab7d3b89f656e5c</a>.

<p>Here is the result:</p>

<p>We can see that a single invocation took 11 microseconds on average and the median was about 10 microseconds per invocation.</p>
<p>The CPU profile looks like this:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="CPU profile before the fix" src="https://questdb.com/images/blog/2026-01-13/before.svg" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Click to zoom, open in a new tab for interactivity</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The CPU profile confirms that each invocation of <code>getCurrentThreadUserTime()</code> does multiple syscalls. In fact, most of the CPU time
is spent in syscalls. We can see files being opened and closed. Closing alone results in multiple syscalls, including futex locks.</p>
<p>Let's see the benchmark result with the fix applied:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>Benchmark                                             Mode       Cnt     Score   Error  Units</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime          sample  11037102     0.279 ± 0.001  us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.00    sample               0.070          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.50    sample               0.310          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.90    sample               0.440          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.95    sample               0.530          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.99    sample               0.610          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.999   sample               1.030          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.9999  sample               3.088          us/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p1.00    sample            1230.848          us/op</span></p></pre></div>
<p>The average went down from 11 microseconds to 279 nanos. This means the latency of the fixed version is 40x lower
than the old version. While this is not a 400x improvement, it's within the 30x - 400x range from the original report. Chances are
the delta would be higher with a different setup.
Let's have a look at the new profile:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="CPU profile after the fix" src="https://questdb.com/images/blog/2026-01-13/after.svg" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Click to zoom, open in a new tab for interactivity</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The profile is much cleaner. There is just a single syscall. If the profile is to be trusted then most of the time is spent in JVM, outside of the kernel.</p>
<h2 id="how-documented-is-this?"><a href="#how-documented-is-this?">How Documented Is This?</a></h2>
<p>Barely. The bit encoding is stable. It hasn't changed in 20 years, but you won't find it in the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/clock_gettime"><code>clock_gettime(2)</code> man page</a>.
The closest thing to official documentation is the kernel source itself, in <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/4702f4eceb639b6af199151e352e570943619d98/kernel/time/posix-cpu-timers.c"><code>kernel/time/posix-cpu-timers.c</code></a> and the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/eee51b0ae5c52a77ed65ad59b55002d1397b40d5/include/linux/posix-timers_types.h"><code>CPUCLOCK_*</code> macros</a>.</p>
<p>The kernel's policy is clear: <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75">don't break userspace</a>.</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="Linus on kernel stability: Don't break userspace" src="https://questdb.com/images/blog/2026-01-13/linus.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Linus's position on ABI stability is... unambiguous.</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>My take: If <a href="https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/bd569425330c6f5644c232b4b253e9ab905fcdba/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/kernel-posix-cpu-timers.h">glibc depends on it</a>, it's not going away.</p>
<h2 id="pushing-further"><a href="#pushing-further">Pushing Further</a></h2>
<p>When looking at profiler data from the 'after' run, I spotted a further optimization opportunity: A good portion of the remaining syscall is spent inside a radix tree lookup. Have a look:</p>
<figure><div><p><img alt="Zoomed-in CPU profile showing radix tree lookup" src="https://questdb.com/images/blog/2026-01-13/radix.webp" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Click to zoom</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>When the JVM calls <code>pthread_getcpuclockid()</code>, it receives a <code>clockid</code> that encodes the thread's ID. When this <code>clockid</code> is passed to <code>clock_gettime()</code>,
the kernel extracts the thread ID and performs a radix tree lookup to find the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/8ec7c826d97b390879df2a03dfb035c70af86779/include/linux/pid.h#L57"><code>pid</code> structure</a> associated with that ID.</p>
<p>However, the Linux kernel has a fast-path. If the encoded PID in the <code>clockid</code> is 0, the kernel interprets this as "the current thread" and skips the radix tree lookup entirely, jumping to the current task's structure directly.</p>
<p>The OpenJDK fix currently obtains the specific TID, flips the bits, and passes it to <code>clock_gettime()</code>. This forces the kernel to take the "generalized path" (the radix tree lookup).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/4702f4eceb639b6af199151e352e570943619d98/kernel/time/posix-cpu-timers.c#L57-L95">source code</a> looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>/*</span></p><p><span> * Functions for validating access to tasks.</span></p><p><span> */</span></p><p><span>static struct pid *pid_for_clock(const clockid_t clock, bool gettime)</span></p><p><span>{</span></p><p><span>[...]</span></p><p><span>  /*</span></p><p><span>  * If the encoded PID is 0, then the timer is targeted at current</span></p><p><span>  * or the process to which current belongs.</span></p><p><span>  */</span></p><p><span>  if (upid == 0)</span></p><p><span>      // the fast path: current task lookup, cheap</span></p><p><span>      return thread ? task_pid(current) : task_tgid(current);</span></p><p><span>  // the generalized path: radix tree lookup, more expensive</span></p><p><span>  pid = find_vpid(upid);</span></p><p><span>  [...]</span></p></pre></div>
<p>If the JVM constructed the entire <code>clockid</code> manually with PID=0 encoded (rather than obtaining the <code>clockid</code> via <code>pthread_getcpuclockid()</code>), the kernel could take the fast-path and avoid the radix tree lookup altogether.
The JVM already pokes bits in the <code>clockid</code>, so constructing it entirely from scratch wouldn't be a bigger leap compatibility-wise.</p>
<p>Let's try it!</p>
<p>First, a refresher on the <code>clockid</code> encoding. The <code>clockid</code> is constructed like this:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>clockid for TID=42, user-time-only:</span></p><p><span>  1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1110_1010_1101</span></p><p><span>  └───────────────~42────────────────┘│└┘</span></p><p><span>                                      │ └─ 01 = VIRT (user time only)</span></p><p><span>                                      └─── 1 = per-thread</span></p></pre></div>
<p>For the current thread, we want PID=0 encoded, which gives <code>~0</code> in the upper bits:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>  1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1111_1101</span></p><p><span>  └─────────────── ~0 ───────────────┘│└┘</span></p><p><span>                                      │ └─ 01 = VIRT (user time only)</span></p><p><span>                                      └─── 1 = per-thread</span></p></pre></div>
<p>We can translate this into C++ as follows:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>// Linux Kernel internal bit encoding for dynamic CPU clocks:</span></p><p><span>// [31:3] : Bitwise NOT of the PID or TID (~0 for current thread)</span></p><p><span>// [2]    : 1 = Per-thread clock, 0 = Per-process clock</span></p><p><span>// [1:0]  : Clock type (0 = PROF, 1 = VIRT/User-only, 2 = SCHED)</span></p><p><span>static_assert(sizeof(clockid_t) == 4, "Linux clockid_t must be 32-bit");</span></p><p><span>constexpr clockid_t CLOCK_CURRENT_THREAD_USERTIME = static_cast&lt;clockid_t&gt;(~0u &lt;&lt; 3 | 4 | 1);</span></p></pre></div>
<p>And then make a tiny teensy change to <code>user_thread_cpu_time()</code>:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>jlong os::current_thread_cpu_time(bool user_sys_cpu_time) {</span></p><p><span>  if (user_sys_cpu_time) {</span></p><p><span>    return os::Linux::thread_cpu_time(CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID);</span></p><p><span>  } else {</span></p><p><span>   - return user_thread_cpu_time(Thread::current());</span></p><p><span>   + return os::Linux::thread_cpu_time(CLOCK_CURRENT_THREAD_USERTIME);</span></p><p><span>  }</span></p></pre></div>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/compare/master...jerrinot:jdk:jh_faster_getCurrentThreadUserTime?diff=unified&amp;w">change above</a> is sufficient to make <code>getCurrentThreadUserTime()</code> use the fast-path in the kernel.</p>
<p>Given that we are in nanoseconds territory already, we tweak the test a bit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the iteration and fork count</li>
<li>Use just a single thread to minimize noise</li>
<li>Switch to nanos</li>
</ul>
<p>The benchmark changes are meant to eliminate noise from the rest of my system and get a more precise measurement of the small delta we expect:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>@State(Scope.Benchmark)</span></p><p><span>@Warmup(iterations = 4, time = 5)</span></p><p><span>@Measurement(iterations = 10, time = 5)</span></p><p><span>@BenchmarkMode(Mode.SampleTime)</span></p><p><span>@OutputTimeUnit(TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS)</span></p><p><span>@Threads(1)</span></p><p><span>@Fork(value = 3)</span></p><p><span>public class ThreadMXBeanBench {</span></p><p><span>    static final ThreadMXBean mxThreadBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();</span></p><p><span>    static long user; // To avoid dead-code elimination</span></p><p><span>    @Benchmark</span></p><p><span>    public void getCurrentThreadUserTime() throws Throwable {</span></p><p><span>        user = mxThreadBean.getCurrentThreadUserTime();</span></p><p><span>    }</span></p><p><span>    public static void main(String[] args) throws RunnerException {</span></p><p><span>        Options opt = new OptionsBuilder()</span></p><p><span>                .include(ThreadMXBeanBench.class.getSimpleName())</span></p><p><span>                .build();</span></p><p><span>        new Runner(opt).run();</span></p><p><span>    }</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></pre></div>
<p>The version currently in JDK main branch gives:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>Benchmark                                             Mode      Cnt       Score   Error  Units</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime          sample  4347067      81.746 ± 0.510  ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.00    sample               69.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.50    sample               80.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.90    sample               90.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.95    sample               90.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.99    sample               90.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.999   sample              230.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.9999  sample             1980.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p1.00    sample           653312.000          ns/op</span></p></pre></div>
<p>With the manual <code>clockid</code> construction, which uses the kernel fast-path, we get:</p>
<div><pre><p><span>Benchmark                                             Mode      Cnt       Score   Error  Units</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime          sample  5081223      70.813 ± 0.325  ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.00    sample               59.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.50    sample               70.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.90    sample               70.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.95    sample               70.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.99    sample               80.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.999   sample              170.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p0.9999  sample             1830.000          ns/op</span></p><p><span>ThreadMXBeanBench.getCurrentThreadUserTime:p1.00    sample           425472.000          ns/op</span></p></pre></div>
<p>The average went down from 81.7 ns to 70.8 ns, so about a 13% improvement. The improvements are visible across all percentiles as well.
Is it worth the loss of clarity from constructing the <code>clockid</code> manually rather than using <code>pthread_getcpuclockid()</code>?
I am not entirely sure. The absolute gain is small and makes additional assumptions about kernel internals, including the size of <code>clockid_t</code>. On the other hand, it's still a gain without any downside in practice. <em>(famous last words...)</em></p>
<h2 id="browsing-for-gems"><a href="#browsing-for-gems">Browsing for Gems</a></h2>
<p>This is why I like browsing commits of large open source projects. A 40-line deletion eliminated a 400x performance gap. The fix required no new kernel features, just knowledge of a stable-but-obscure Linux ABI detail.</p>
<p>The lessons:</p>
<p><strong>Read the kernel source.</strong> POSIX tells you what's portable. The kernel source code tells you what's possible. Sometimes there's a 400x difference between the two. Whether it is worth exploiting is a different question.</p>
<p><strong>Check the old assumptions.</strong> The <code>/proc</code> parsing approach made sense when it was written, before anyone realized it could be exploited this way. Assumptions get baked into code. Revisiting them occasionally pays off.</p>
<p>The change landed on December 3, 2025. Just one day before the <a href="https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/26/">JDK 26 feature freeze</a>. If you're using <code>ThreadMXBean.getCurrentThreadUserTime()</code>, JDK 26 (releasing March 2026) brings you a free 30-400x speedup!</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

    <p>I am an LLM productivity skeptic.</p>
<p>I find LLMs useful as a sort of digital clerk - searching the web for me, finding documentation, looking up algorithms. I even find them useful<sup><a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#footnote-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> in a limited coding capacity; with a small context and clear guidelines.</p>
<p>But doing "prompt-driven development" or "vibe coding" with an Agentic LLM was an incredibly disapointing experience for me. It required an immense amount of baby sitting, for small code changes, made slowly, which were often wrong. All the while I sat there feeling dumber and dumber, as my tokens drained away.</p>
<p>Of course that was <em>my</em> experience, and <em>my</em> preference. I genuinely don't mind if other people vibe code. Go for it! I do not deny this kind of coding is enabling a lot of people - who aren't experienced devs - to create things they would never otherwise be able to create. (Also, sometimes they pay me to clean them up afterwards, which is nice.)</p>
<p>But that is not enough for the vocal proponents. It's the future! You'll be left behind! Software has changed forever! And then, inevitably, comes the character evaluation, which goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You - a senior dev - are resisting this change due to deeply held psychological fears of being made irrelevant and/or having to learn new things. You are stuck in your ways and unwilling to change them because you are afraid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has always baffled me, because quite frankly I <em>like</em> the idea of agentic coding. I often feel the actual implementation is a bottleneck to the things I want to create. I would love it if I could just sit around making specs (yes I am a programmer who enjoys this) and have little machines implement it for me perfectly. It's a wonderful fantasy world, and I wish I could inhabit it. That's why I was so disappointed.</p>
<p>And it made me think - why are these people so insistent, and hostile? Why can't they live and let live? Why do they need to convince the rest of us? And to be honest, I am developing my own character evaluation. It's not very charitable, but it is making a lot of sense to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You tried agentic coding. You realised it was better at programming than you are. You see a lot of accomplished, prominent developers<sup><a id="footnote-ref-2" href="#footnote-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> claiming they are more productive without it. Could they just be that much better at programming than I am? No! They are just threatened. They are the ones who are insecure! I'm a great developer!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's projection. Their evangelism is born of insecurity.</p>
<h2>An Open Question</h2>
<p>I am still willing to admit I am wrong. That I'm not holding the agents properly. That doing this is it's own skill and I have not spent enough time with it. I have changed my mind on tech before, and I'm sure I will do so again.</p>
<p>LLM evangelists - are you willing to admit that you just might not be that good at programming computers? Maybe you once were. Maybe you never were.</p>

(I'm exaggerating a bit; it shows the weight on its display, but the app used to store data for up to 5 users to keep track over time. I miss that!)

<p>In the past few months the MetaBrainz team has been fighting a battle against unscrupulous AI companies ignoring common courtesies (such as robots.txt) and <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/29/ai_web_crawlers_are_destroying/">scraping the Internet in order to build up their AI models</a>. Rather than downloading our dataset in one complete download, they insist on loading all of MusicBrainz <strong>one page at a time</strong>. This of course would take hundreds of years to complete and is utterly pointless. In doing so, they are overloading our servers and preventing legitimate users from accessing our site.</p>
<p>Now the AI scrapers have found ListenBrainz and are hitting a number of our API endpoints for their nefarious data gathering purposes. In order to protect our services from becoming overloaded, we’ve made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://listenbrainz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/api/metadata.html#post--1-metadata-lookup-">/metadata/lookup</a> API endpoints (GET and POST versions) now require the caller to send an <a href="https://listenbrainz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/api/index.html#authentication">Authorization token</a> in order for this endpoint to work.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://labs.api.listenbrainz.org/">ListenBrainz Labs API</a> endpoints for mbid-mapping, mbid-mapping-release and mbid-mapping-explain have been removed. Those were always intended for debugging purposes and will also soon be replaced with a new endpoints for our upcoming improved mapper.</li>
<li>LB Radio will now require users to be logged in to use it (and API endpoint users will need to send the Authorization header). The error message for logged in users is a bit clunky at the moment; we’ll fix this once we’ve finished the work for this year’s Year in Music.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry for these hassles and no-notice changes, but they were required in order to keep our services functioning at an acceptable level.</p>

He said GW staff are barred from using it to actually produce anything, but admitted a “few” senior managers are experimenting with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rountree said AI was “a very broad topic and to be honest I’m not an expert on it,” then went on to lay down the company line:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We do have a few senior managers that are [experts on AI]: none are that excited about it yet. We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorised use outside of GW including in any of our competitions. We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective, the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are allowing those few senior managers to continue to be inquisitive about the technology. We have also agreed we will be maintaining a strong commitment to protect our intellectual property and respect our human creators.

Talented and passionate individuals that make Warhammer the rich, evocative IP that our hobbyists and we all love.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop owns and operates a number of hugely popular tabletop war games, including Warhammer 40,000 and Age of Sigmar.

This official, human-made Warhammer 40,000 artwork is beloved by fans, most of whom take a dim view of the mere whiff of generative AI “art” sold or released in any official capacity by either Games Workshop itself, or its partners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Games Workshop sells expensive Warhammer 40,000 ‘codex’ rulebooks that are packed with stunning official art as well as lore.

<p>AI generated influencers are sharing fake images on Instagram that appear to show them having sex with celebrities like LeBron James, iShowSpeed, and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. One AI influencer even shared an image of her in bed with Venezuela’s president Nicolás Maduro. The images are AI generated but are not disclosed as such, and funnel users to an adult content site where the AI generated influencers sell nude images.&nbsp;</p><p>This recent trend is the latest strategy from the growing business of monetizing AI generated porn by harvesting attention on Instagram with shocking or salacious content. As with previous schemes we’ve covered, the Instagram posts that pretend to show attractive young women in bed with celebrities are created without the celebrities’ consent and are not disclosed as being AI generated, violating two of Instagram’s policies and showing once again that Meta is unable or unwilling to reign in AI generated content on its platform.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the Reels in this genre that I have seen follow a highly specific formula and started to appear around December 2025. First, we see a still image of an AI-generated influencer next to a celebrity, often in the form of a selfie with both of them looking at the camera. The text on the screen says “How it started.” Then, the video briefly cuts to another still image or videos of the AI generated influencer and the celebrity post coitus, sweaty, with tussled hair and sometimes smeared makeup. Many of these posts use the same handful of audio clips. Since Instagram allows users to browse Reels that use the same audio, clicking on one of these will reveal dozens of examples of similar Reels.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DTDODMdiC1d/?ref=404media.co"><u>LeBron James</u></a> and adult film star <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DS51AdUElNm/?ref=404media.co"><u>Johnny Sins</u></a> are frequent targets of these posts, but I’ve also seen similar Reels with the likeness of Twitch streamer iShowSpeed, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, MMA fighters Jon Jones and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DTLOnUukU-6/?ref=404media.co"><u>Connor McGregor</u></a>, soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo, and many others, far too many to name them all. The AI influencer accounts obviously don’t care whether it's believable that these fake women are actually sleeping with celebrities and will include any known person who is likely to earn engagement. Amazingly, one AI influencer applied the same formula to Venezuela’s president Maduro shortly after he was captured by the United States.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2026/01/data-src-image-c6a4bd72-a4a8-4960-bdf6-da57238154b5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="463" height="850"></figure><p>These Instagram Reels frequently have hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions of views. A post from one of these AI influencers that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTUCOjYCjwW/?ref=404media.co"><u>shows her in bed with Jon Jones</u></a> has has 7.7 million views. A video showing another AI influencer in a bed with iShowSpeed has 14.5 million views.&nbsp;</p><p>Users who stumble upon one of these videos might be inclined to click on the AI-influencer's username to check her bio and see if she has an OnlyFans account, as is the case with many adult content creators who promote their work on Instagram. What these users will find is an account bio that doesn’t disclose its AI generated, and a link to Fanvue, an OnlyFans competitor with more permissive policies around AI generated content. On Fanvue, these accounts do disclose that they are “AI-generated or enhanced,” and sell access to nude images and videos.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta did not respond to a request for comment, but removed some of the Reels I flagged. </p><p>Posting provocative AI generated media in order to funnel eyeballs to adult content platforms where AI generated porn can be monetized is now an established business. Sometimes, these AI influencers <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-booming-ai-pimping-industry-3/"><u>steal directly from real adult content creators</u></a> by faceswapping themselves into their existing videos. Once in a while a new “meta” strategy for AI influencers will emerge and dominate the algorithm. For example, last year I wrote about people using AI to create <a href="https://www.404media.co/people-are-using-ai-to-create-influencers-with-down-syndrome-who-sell-nudes/"><u>influencers with down syndrome who sell nudes</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Some other video formats I’ve seen from AI influencers recently follow the formula I describe in this article, but rather than suggesting the influencer slept with a celebrity, it shows them sleeping with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTVLswbjAvA/?ref=404media.co"><u>entire sports teams</u></a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTU3HCADHic/?ref=404media.co"><u>African tribal chiefs</u></a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTAznwLCOka/?ref=404media.co"><u>Walmart managers</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DSwxJGyjEkh/?ref=404media.co"><u>sharing a man with their mom</u></a>.</p><p>Notably, celebrities are better equipped than adult content creators to take on AI accounts that are using their likeness without consent, and last year LeBron James, a frequent target of this latest meta, <a href="https://www.404media.co/lebron-james-lawyers-send-cease-and-desist-to-ai-company-making-pregnant-videos-of-him/"><u>sent a cease-and-desist notice</u></a> to a company that was making AI videos of him and sharing them on Instagram.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>On the evening of April 6th, a student <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/20210407001658.2208535-1-pakki001@umn.edu/">emailed</a> a patch to a list of developers. Fifteen days later, the University of Minnesota was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22398156/university-minnesota-linux-kernal-ban-research">banned</a> from contributing to the Linux kernel.</p><p>“I suggest you find a different community to do experiments on,” wrote Linux Foundation fellow Greg Kroah-Hartman in a livid email. “You are not welcome here.”</p><p>How did one email lead to a university-wide ban? I’ve spent the past week digging into this world — the players, the jargon, the university’s turbulent history with open-source software, the devoted and principled Linux kernel community. None of the University of Minnesota researchers would talk to me for this story. But among the other major characters — the Linux developers — there was no such hesitancy. This was a community eager to speak; it was a community betrayed.</p><p>The story begins in 2017, when a systems-security researcher named Kangjie Lu became an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota.</p><p>Lu’s research, per his <a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/">website</a>, concerns “the intersection of security, operating systems, program analysis, and compilers.” But Lu had his eye on Linux — most of his papers involve the Linux kernel in some way.</p><p>The Linux kernel is, at a basic level, the core of any Linux operating system. It’s the liaison between the OS and the device on which it’s running. A Linux user doesn’t interact with the kernel, but it’s essential to getting things done — it manages memory usage, writes things to the hard drive, and decides what tasks can use the CPU when. The kernel is open-source, meaning its millions of lines of code are publicly available for anyone to view and contribute to.</p><div><p>Getting a patch on people’s computers is no easy task</p></div><p>Well, “anyone.” Getting a patch onto people’s computers is no easy task. A submission needs to pass through a large web of developers and “maintainers” (<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/maintainers.html">thousands</a> of volunteers, who are each responsible for the upkeep of different parts of the kernel) before it ultimately ends up in the mainline repository. Once there, it goes through a long testing period before eventually being incorporated into the “stable release,” which will go out to mainstream operating systems. It’s a rigorous system designed to weed out both malicious and incompetent actors. But — <a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-teen-threw-scots-wiki-into-chaos-and-it-highlights-a-1844851959">as is always the case with crowdsourced operations</a> — there’s room for human error.</p><p>Some of Lu’s recent work has revolved around studying that potential for human error and reducing its influence. He’s <a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/papers/lrsan.pdf">proposed</a> <a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/papers/deadline.pdf">systems</a> to automatically detect various types of bugs in open source, using the Linux kernel as a test case. These experiments tend to involve reporting bugs, submitting patches to Linux kernel maintainers, and reporting their acceptance rates. In <a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/papers/crix.pdf">a 2019 paper</a>, for example, Lu and two of his PhD students, Aditya Pakki and Qiushi Wu, presented a system (“Crix”) for detecting a certain class of bugs in OS kernels. The trio found 278 of these bugs with Crix and submitted patches for all of them — the fact that maintainers accepted 151 meant the tool was promising.</p><p>On the whole, it was a useful body of work. Then, late last year, Lu took aim not at the kernel itself, but at its community.</p><p>In “On the Feasibility of Stealthily Introducing Vulnerabilities in Open-Source Software via Hypocrite Commits,” Lu and Wu <a href="https://linuxreviews.org/images/d/d9/OpenSourceInsecurity.pdf">explained</a> that they’d been able to introduce vulnerabilities into the Linux kernel by submitting patches that appeared to fix real bugs but also introduced serious problems. The group called these submissions “hypocrite commits.” (Wu didn’t respond to a request for comment for this story; Lu referred me to Mats Heimdahl, the head of the university’s department of computer science and engineering, who referred me to the <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/cs/linux-incident">department’s website</a>.)</p><p>The explicit goal of this experiment, as the researchers have since emphasized, was to improve the security of the Linux kernel by demonstrating to developers how a malicious actor might slip through their net. One could argue that their process was similar, in principle, to that of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382243/counter-strike-global-offensive-game-engine-bug-take-over-pc">white-hat hacking</a>: play around with software, find bugs, let the developers know.</p><p>But the loudest reaction the paper received, on Twitter and across the Linux community, wasn’t gratitude — it was outcry.</p><p>“That paper, it’s just a lot of crap,” says <a href="https://www.dgregscott.com/">Greg Scott</a>, an IT professional who has worked with open-source software for over 20 years.</p><p>“In my personal view, it was completely unethical,” says security researcher Kenneth White, who is co-director of the Open Crypto Audit Project.</p><p>The frustration had little to do with the hypocrite commits themselves. In their paper, Lu and Wu claimed that none of their bugs had actually made it to the Linux kernel — in all of their test cases, they’d eventually pulled their bad patches and provided real ones. Kroah-Hartman, of the Linux Foundation, contests this — he told <em>The Verge </em>that one patch from the study did make it into repositories, though he notes it didn’t end up causing any harm.</p><div><p>“In my personal view, it was completely unethical.”</p></div><p>Still, the paper hit a number of nerves among a very passionate (and very online) community when Lu first shared its abstract on Twitter. Some developers were angry that the university had intentionally wasted the maintainers’ time — which is a key difference between Minnesota’s work and a white-hat hacker poking around the Starbucks app for a bug bounty. “The researchers crossed a line they shouldn’t have crossed,” Scott says. “Nobody hired this group. They just chose to do it. And a whole lot of people spent a whole lot of time evaluating their patches.”</p><p>“If I were a volunteer putting my personal time into commits and testing, and then I found out someone’s experimenting, I would be unhappy,” Scott adds.</p><p>Then, there’s the dicier issue of whether an experiment like this amounts to human experimentation. It doesn’t, according to the University of Minnesota’s Institutional Review Board. Lu and Wu applied for approval in response to the outcry, and they were granted a formal letter of exemption.</p><p>The community members I spoke to didn’t buy it. “The researchers attempted to get retroactive Institutional Review Board approval on their actions that were, at best, wildly ignorant of the tenants of basic human subjects’ protections, which are typically taught by senior year of undergraduate institutions,” says White.</p><p>“It is generally not considered a nice thing to try to do ‘research’ on people who do not know you are doing research,” says Kroah-Hartman. “No one asked us if it was acceptable.”</p><div><p>“That paper, it’s just a lot of crap.”</p></div><p>That thread ran through many of the responses I got from developers — that regardless of the harms or benefits that resulted from its research, the university was messing around not just with community members but with the community’s underlying philosophy. Anyone who uses an operating system places some degree of trust in the people who contribute to and maintain that system. That’s especially true for people who use open-source software, and it’s a principle that some Linux users take very seriously.</p><p>“By definition, open source depends on a lively community,” Scott says. “There have to be people in that community to submit stuff, people in the community to document stuff, and people to use it and to set up this whole feedback loop to constantly make it stronger. That loop depends on lots of people, and you have to have a level of trust in that system ... If somebody violates that trust, that messes things up.”</p><p>After the paper’s release, it was clear to many Linux kernel developers that something needed to be done about the University of Minnesota — previous submissions from the university needed to be reviewed. “Many of us put an item on our to-do list that said, ‘Go and audit all umn.edu submissions,’” said Kroah-Hartman, who was, above all else, annoyed that the experiment had put another task on his plate. But many kernel maintainers are volunteers with day jobs, and a large-scale review process didn’t materialize. At least, not in 2020.</p><p>On April 6th, 2021, Aditya Pakki, using his own email address, submitted a patch.</p><p>There was some brief discussion from other developers on the email chain, which fizzled out within a few days. Then Kroah-Hartman took a look. He was already on high alert for bad code from the University of Minnesota, and Pakki’s email address set off alarm bells. What’s more, the patch Pakki submitted didn’t appear helpful. “It takes a lot of effort to create a change that looks correct, yet does something wrong,” Kroah-Hartman told me. “These submissions all fit that pattern.”</p><p>So on April 20th, Kroah-Hartman put his foot down.</p><p>“Please stop submitting known-invalid patches,” he wrote to Pakki. “Your professor is playing around with the review process in order to achieve a paper in some strange and bizarre way.”</p><p>Maintainer Leon Romanovsky then chimed in: he’d taken a look at four previously accepted patches from Pakki and found that three of them added “various severity” security vulnerabilities.</p><div><p>There’s the dicier issue of whether an experiment like this amounts to human experimentation</p></div><p>Kroah-Hartman hoped that his request would be the end of the affair. But then Pakki lashed back. “I respectfully ask you to cease and desist from making wild accusations that are bordering on slander,” he wrote to Kroah-Hartman in what appears to be a private message.</p><p>Kroah-Hartman responded. “You and your group have publicly admitted to sending known-buggy patches to see how the kernel community would react to them, and published a paper based on that work. Now you submit a series of obviously-incorrect patches again, so what am I supposed to think of such a thing?” he wrote back on the morning of April 21st.</p><p>Later that day, Kroah-Hartman made it official. “Future submissions from anyone with a umn.edu address should be default-rejected unless otherwise determined to actually be a valid fix,” he wrote in an <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210421130105.1226686-1-gregkh@linuxfoundation.org/">email</a> to a number of maintainers, as well as Lu, Pakki, and Wu. Kroah-Hartman reverted 190 submissions from Minnesota affiliates — 68 couldn’t be reverted but still needed manual review.</p><p>It’s not clear what experiment the new patch was part of, and Pakki declined to comment for this story. <a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/">Lu’s website</a> includes a brief reference to “superfluous patches from Aditya Pakki for a new bug-finding project.”</p><p>What is clear is that Pakki’s antics have finally set the delayed review process in motion; Linux developers began digging through all patches that university affiliates had submitted in the past. Jonathan Corbet, the founder and editor in chief of <a href="http://lwn.net/"><em>LWN.net</em></a><em>, </em>recently provided an update on that review process. Per his assessment, “Most of the suspect patches have turned out to be acceptable, if not great.” Of over 200 patches that were flagged, 42 are still set to be removed from the kernel.</p><p>Regardless of whether their reaction was justified, the Linux community gets to decide if the University of Minnesota affiliates can contribute to the kernel again. And that community has made its demands clear: the school needs to convince them its future patches won’t be a waste of anyone’s time.</p><p>What will it take to do that? In a statement released the same day as the ban, the university’s computer science department suspended its research into Linux-kernel security and <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/cs/statement-cse-linux-kernel-research-april-21-2021">announced</a> that it would investigate Lu’s and Wu’s research method.</p><p>But that wasn’t enough for the Linux Foundation. Mike Dolan, Linux Foundation SVP and GM of projects, wrote a letter to the university on April 23rd, which <em>The Verge</em> has viewed. Dolan made four demands. He asked that the school release “all information necessary to identify all proposals of known-vulnerable code from any U of MN experiment” to help with the audit process. He asked that the paper on hypocrite commits be withdrawn from publication. He asked that the school ensure future experiments undergo IRB review before they begin, and that future IRB reviews ensure the subjects of experiments provide consent, “per usual research norms and laws.”</p><div><p>The school needs to convince them its future patches won’t be a waste of anyone’s time</p></div><p>Two of those demands have since been met. Wu and Lu have <a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/papers/withdrawal-letter.pdf">retracted</a> the paper and have <a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/papers/full-disclosure.pdf">released</a> all the details of their study.</p><p>The university’s status on the third and fourth counts is unclear. In a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z3Nm2bfR4tH1nOGBpuOmLyoJVEiO9cUq/view">letter</a> sent to the Linux Foundation on April 27th, Heimdahl and Loren Terveen (the computer science and engineering department’s associate department head) maintain that the university’s IRB “acted properly,” and argues that human-subjects research “has a precise technical definition according to US federal regulations ... and this technical definition may not accord with intuitive understanding of concepts like ‘experiments’ or even ‘experiments on people.’” They do, however, commit to providing more ethics training for department faculty. Reached for comment, university spokesperson Dan Gilchrist referred me to the computer science and engineering department’s website.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lu, Wu, and Pakki apologized to the Linux community this past Saturday in an <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAK8KejpUVLxmqp026JY7x5GzHU2YJLPU8SzTZUNXU2OXC70ZQQ@mail.gmail.com/">open letter</a> to the kernel mailing list, which contained some apology and some defense. “We made a mistake by not finding a way to consult with the community and obtain permission before running this study; we did that because we knew we could not ask the maintainers of Linux for permission, or they would be on the lookout for hypocrite patches,” the researchers wrote, before going on to reiterate that they hadn’t put any vulnerabilities into the Linux kernel, and that their other patches weren’t related to the hypocrite commits research.</p><p>Kroah-Hartman wasn’t having it. “The Linux Foundation and the Linux Foundation’s Technical Advisory Board submitted a letter on Friday to your university,” he responded. “Until those actions are taken, we do not have anything further to discuss.”</p><div><div><p><a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479520/1220247994.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="1951" data-pswp-width="3600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="Coronavirus in Minnesota" data-chromatic="ignore" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px" srcset="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479520/1220247994.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479520/1220247994.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479520/1220247994.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479520/1220247994.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479520/1220247994.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479520/1220247994.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479520/1220247994.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479520/1220247994.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479520/1220247994.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479520/1220247994.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479520/1220247994.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479520/1220247994.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479520/1220247994.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479520/1220247994.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479520/1220247994.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22479520/1220247994.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div><p><cite>Photo by Glen Stubbe / Star Tribune via Getty Images</cite></p></div><p>From the University of Minnesota researchers’ perspective, they didn’t set out to troll anyone — they were trying to point out a problem with the kernel maintainers’ review process. Now the Linux community has to reckon with the fallout of their experiment and what it means about the security of open-source software.</p><p>Some <a href="https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1385075395884556293?s=20">developers</a> rejected University of Minnesota researchers’ perspective outright, claiming the fact that it’s possible to fool maintainers should be obvious to anyone familiar with open-source software. “If a sufficiently motivated, unscrupulous person can put themselves into a trusted position of updating critical software, there’s honestly little that can be done to stop them,” says White, the security researcher.</p><p>On the other hand, it’s clearly important to be vigilant about potential vulnerabilities in any operating system. And for others in the Linux community, as much ire as the experiment drew, its point about hypocrite commits appears to have been somewhat well taken. The incident has ignited conversations about patch-acceptance policies and how maintainers should handle submissions from new contributors, across Twitter, <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/ksummit/a72a13e56ee5f19b0dee9ae8c1928b020e8809c2.camel@HansenPartnership.com/">email lists</a>, and forums. “Demonstrating this kind of ‘attack’ has been long overdue, and kicked off a very important discussion,” wrote maintainer Christoph Hellwig in an email thread with other maintainers. “I think they deserve a medal of honor.”</p><p>“This research was clearly unethical, but it did make it plain that the OSS development model is vulnerable to bad-faith commits,” one user wrote in a <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/9miojb/hypocrite_commits_apology_letter">discussion post</a>. “It now seems likely that Linux has some devastating back doors.”</p><p>Corbet also called for more scrutiny around new changes in his <a href="https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/854645/e7eff3462424263e/">post</a> about the incident. “If we cannot institutionalize a more careful process, we will continue to see a lot of bugs, and it will not really matter whether they were inserted intentionally or not,” he wrote.</p><p>And even for some of the paper’s most ardent critics, the process did prove a point — albeit, perhaps, the opposite of the one Wu, Lu, and Pakki were trying to make. It demonstrated that the system worked.</p><p>Eric Mintz, who manages 25 Linux servers, says this ban has made him much more confident in the operating system’s security. “I have more trust in the process because this was caught,” he says. “There may be compromises we don’t know about. But because we caught this one, it’s less likely we don’t know about the other ones. Because we have something in place to catch it.”</p><p>To Scott, the fact that the researchers were caught and banned is an example of Linux’s system functioning exactly the way it’s supposed to. “This method worked,” he insists. “The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22248631/solarwinds-hack-cybersecurity-us-menn-decoder-podcast">SolarWinds</a> method, where there’s a big corporation behind it, that system didn’t work. This system did work.”</p><p>“Kernel developers are happy to see new tools created and — if the tools give good results — use them. They will also help with the testing of these tools, but they are less pleased to be recipients of tool-inspired patches that lack proper review,” Corbet writes. The community seems to be open to the University of Minnesota’s feedback — but as the Foundation has made clear, it’s on the school to make amends.</p><p>“The university could repair that trust by sincerely apologizing, and not fake apologizing, and by maybe sending a lot of beer to the right people,” Scott says. “It’s gonna take some work to restore their trust. So hopefully they’re up to it.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODQ1Mw=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Monica Chin</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>January 10, 2026</p><article><p>This article is for early-stage (Seed, Series A) founders who think they have engineering management problems (<em>building eng teams, motivating and performance-managing engineers, structuring work/projects, prioritizing, shipping on time</em>).</p>
<p>The gist: if you <em>think</em> you have these problems, it is likely that the correct solution is to <strong>do nothing, to not manage, and to go back to building product and talking to users</strong>. Put another way, and having managed teams at all scales, I don’t think it’s a good use of your time as a founder to be "managing" engineers at such an early stage.</p>
<p>In the following sections, I'll go through the most typical anti-patterns I've seen, and try to highlight a better use of your time if you think you've hit the situation in question.</p>
<h2 id="do-not-try-to-motivate-your-engineers"><a href="#do-not-try-to-motivate-your-engineers"></a>Do not try to "motivate" your engineers</h2>
<p>A common concern of many founders is making sure that their engineers are working hard. This could mean putting in long hours, working more than competitors, completing heroic codebase rewrites, etc. When these external <em>signs of effort</em> seem to be missing, founders worry that the team is not "motivated", and it can be very tempting to treat symptoms over causes. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>creating cultural norms around putting in long hours (996-style culture) by either requiring or celebrating them</li>
<li>scheduling recurring or non-urgent meetings on weekends (e.g. standup on Saturdays)</li>
<li>micro-managing tasks, or asking people for status reports and other evidence they worked hard</li>
</ul>
<p>These anti-patterns share one thing in common: they start with founders trying to actively <em>do something</em> to motivate the team. This has 2 consequences:</p>
<ol>
<li>This can cause the very engineers you want to retain (those who have many options) to self-select out of your engineering culture. I know several top 1% engineers in the Valley who disengage from recruiting processes when 996 or something similar is mentioned.</li>
<li>You are wasting your mental energy on the wrong problem</li>
</ol>
<p>All of this is a long way of saying that <strong>motivation is an inherent trait</strong> of great startup engineers. Your only job is to hire these engineers, and then to maintain an environment where they want to do their best work. And yes, at that point, you may see them working long hours and doing heroic actions you did not even think were possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Motivation is a hired trait. The only place where managers motivate people is in management books.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll dedicate a post to specific ways you can identify motivation during hiring, but in short, look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>the obvious one: evidence that they indeed exhibited these external signs of motivation (in an unforced way!) in past jobs</li>
<li>signs of grit in their career and life paths (how did they respond to adversity, how have they put their past successes or reputation on the line for some new challenge)</li>
<li>intellectual curiosity in the form of hobbies, nerdy interests that they can talk about with passion</li>
<li>bias for action and fast decision speed</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, as a founder, you should definitely be the most motivated person, in an authentic way (maybe it's some piece of heroic coding, maybe it's taking 2am meetings with European customers, maybe it's something else unique to you). Cultivating your own inner motivation is the most effective way to set the tone for the team.</p>
<h2 id="do-not-hire-managers-too-soon"><a href="#do-not-hire-managers-too-soon"></a>Do not hire managers too soon</h2>
<p>The most obvious external sign that a startup has switched from building a product to building a company is to add management roles. When this switch happens prematurely, a lot of energy gets spent on stage-irrelevant problems.</p>
<p>By definition, an engineering manager needs to manage a team and projects, but if the team is still working on defining what they should be building, there is nothing to manage. Even the most intellectually honest manager will start outputting "management work", such as having 1:1s with everyone, doing some career coaching, applying order to the chaos of potential features by putting them in JIRA tickets or issues, etc. Here's what it means for you as a founder:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are still trying to find product-market fit and build your initial product</li>
<li>an engineering manager is helping you do it in a more optimized way, but they are optimizing a moving target so it does not really improve anything</li>
<li>you don't know if this engineering manager is bad at their job, or if the engineers are not performing, or if the product has no market anyway, or all of the above</li>
</ul>
<p>So how do you define "too soon"? Let's look at a few typical inflection points, assuming at least one founder is technical:</p>
<h3 id="the-founding-stage-5-6-engineers-including-founders"><a href="#the-founding-stage-5-6-engineers-including-founders"></a>The founding stage (5-6 engineers including founders)</h3>
<p>Obviously too soon to hire managers or turn someone into a manager. The only management-like tasks for the founders are hiring and firing, other than that the team should largely be self-organizing and self-sustaining with lightweight tooling (a simple doc can even be used as a task tracker, 1:1s happen organically and are infrequent, etc.).</p>
<p>In general, the bias should be towards doing nothing in terms of management and everything in terms of hiring exceptional people who inherently work well together.</p>
<h3 id="the-multi-team-stage-2-or-3-sub-teams-of-5-engineers-10-15-people-total"><a href="#the-multi-team-stage-2-or-3-sub-teams-of-5-engineers-10-15-people-total"></a>The multi-team stage (2 or 3 sub-teams of 5 engineers, 10-15 people total)</h3>
<p>This might be late seed or series A, with an inkling of a working product. Many teams will decide to implement management at this stage, because it seems like the natural next step. The decision is full of nuances, but I would strongly advise to have all the engineers still report into a single person (ideally the co-founder CTO). Why? Speed of execution and culture, mainly:</p>
<ul>
<li>at 15 engineers, it is very doable for a single person to keep track of everyone's work and ensure alignment.</li>
<li>this is the critical moment where you build the engineering culture that will bring you from here to hundreds of engineers (how do we hire, what do we value, how do we work together, etc.). It's much easier to do this as a flat team with a single leader.</li>
<li>pivots and radical decisions could still happen frequently, which will be exponentially harder if you have to manage these engineers through 2 or 3 line managers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only nuance I would add, if you really need to start structuring the team, is to go with hybrid roles: maybe it's a very hands-on manager who still codes 70% of the time, maybe it's elevating a few key engineers into <em>informal</em> tech lead positions</p>
<h3 id="the-early-growth-stage-going-from-20-to-50-engineers"><a href="#the-early-growth-stage-going-from-20-to-50-engineers"></a>The early growth stage (going from 20 to 50 engineers)</h3>
<p>This is the sweet spot where the benefit of adding more management and more structure should outweigh the cost of letting the inevitable chaos of a larger team take a life of its own. Still, I would highly recommend a less-is-more approach.</p>
<p>Here are a few signs you've reached that stage:</p>
<ul>
<li>the CTO / whoever is managing everyone shows signs of burning out under the load</li>
<li>adding more engineers no longer increases output, meaning you are constrained by team inefficiency</li>
<li>the team excels at week-to-week impact, but nobody seems able to play out what will happen in 3 to 6 months</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a vast topic, and I'll dedicate a future article to that specific stage, including how to hire your first head of engineering.</p>
<h2 id="do-not-copy-google"><a href="#do-not-copy-google"></a>Do not copy Google</h2>
<p>This section addresses two sides of the same coin, both related to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect">halo effect</a> surrounding great companies and more specifically their management practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applying management ideas that Google (or other successful company) have talked about and made popular</li>
<li>Applying the <em>meta-idea</em> of innovating in the field of management (like Google did in their time)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll skip to the conclusion and explain it below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When in doubt, always pick the "node &amp; postgres" stack of management. Do not innovate, keep it boring.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="what-i-mean-by-the-node-and-postgres-of-management"><a href="#what-i-mean-by-the-node-and-postgres-of-management"></a>What I mean by the "node &amp; postgres" of management</h3>
<p>Node &amp; postgres share these common traits: they have huge communities, their bugs and quirks have been explored by millions of people, and so they are great choices for early-stage startups compared to, say, C++ and OracleDB. No matter what you think about their technical merits, it would be very hard to point to them as a reason why a startup failed. They are just solid, boring tools, and they work at the early stage.</p>
<p>You should use the same type of boring, widely used, stage-appropriate tools when it comes to managing your startup. Every ounce of "innovation" you spend on your organizational structure, title philosophy, or new-age 1:1 is an ounce you aren't spending on your product. At the seed stage, your culture shouldn't be unique because of your clever peer feedback system, it should be unique because of the speed at which you solve customer problems.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-boring-stack-of-seed-stage-management"><a href="#what-is-the-boring-stack-of-seed-stage-management"></a>What is the boring stack of seed stage management</h3>
<p>As a conclusion to this section and to the entire article, I want to share, somewhat paradoxically, a few useful management activities specifically for the early stage. They almost all share the same "reluctant" approach to engineering management, which I think is a healthy leadership approach at that particular stage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hire inherently motivated people</strong>: see first section</li>
<li><strong>Don't manage around a hiring mistake</strong>, let them go quickly and gracefully</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous status updates</strong>: do not adopt all the "Scrum rituals" like standups, retros, etc. wholesale, and if you do, keep them asynchronous. There is little added value to a voiced update, even if it makes you feel good that people are indeed working hard and showing up to the standup on time!</li>
<li><strong>An avoidant relationship to Slack</strong>: while Slack is a given in today's distributed or hybrid teams, it can quickly become an attention destroyer, especially for engineers who need uninterrupted time to work. Keep it in check.</li>
<li><strong>Organic 1:1s</strong> (as opposed to recurring ones): keep them topic-heavy and ad-hoc, as opposed to relationship maintenance like in the corporate world.</li>
<li><strong>Unstructured documents over systems of records</strong>: unless you need to itemize tasks for audit purposes, a few notion or google docs can actually scale for 10-15 engineers, especially given current AI tools. They have very little overhead and are unbeatable in terms of flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme transparency</strong>: give everyone access to everything (customer call notes, investor updates, budgets, etc.). Not only will you build trust with the team, but you will also remove the need to "communicate" (as in, filtering and processing information), which is a typical management task.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear, many of these practices do not scale past 20-25 engineers, but that's part of the point.</p>
<p>I hope you found this post actionable, good luck with building your team!</p></article></section><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><!--/$--></div></div>]]></description>

				<p>With agentic AI embedded at the OS level, databases storing entire digital lives accessible to malware, tasks whose reliability quickly breaks down at each step, and being opted-in without consent, Signal leadership is sounding the alarm for the industry to pull back until threats can be mitigated.</p>				
				
<p>At the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/">39th Chaos Communication Congress</a> (39C3) in Hamburg, Germany, Signal President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meredith_Whittaker">Meredith Whittaker</a> and VP of Strategy and Global Affairs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/udbhav-tiwari-b4919839/">Udbhav Tiwari</a> gave a presentation titled <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-ai-agent-ai-spy#t=2374">AI Agent, AI Spy</a>. In it, they shared the many vulnerabilities and concerns they have about how agentic AI is being implemented, the very real threat it’s bringing to enterprise companies, and how they recommend the industry change to mitigate a disaster in the making.</p>

<p>A key component of AI agents is that they must know enough about you and have access to sensitive data so that they can autonomously take actions on your behalf, such as making purchases, scheduling events, and responding to messages. However, <strong>the way AI agents are being implemented is making them insecure, unreliable, and open to surveillance</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-ai-agents-are-vulnerable-to-threats">How AI agents are vulnerable to threats</h2>



<p>Microsoft is trying to bring agentic AI to its Windows 11 users via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Recall">Recall</a>. Recall takes a screenshot of your screen every few seconds, OCRs the text, and does semantic analysis of the context and actions. It then creates a forensic dossier of everything you do into a single database on your computer. The database includes a precise timeline of actions, full raw text (via OCR), dwell time, and focus on specific apps and actions. Additionally, it assigns topics to specific activities.</p>



<p><strong>Tiwari says the problem with this approach is that it doesn’t mitigate the threat of malware (via online attacks) and indirect (hidden) prompt injection attacks, which can all gain access to the database.</strong> These vulnerabilities subsequently circumvent end-to-end encryption (E2EE), prompting Signal to add a flag in its app to prevent its screen from being recorded, but Tiwari says that’s not a reliable or long-term solution.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-complex-agentic-tasks-aren-t-reliable">Why complex agentic tasks aren’t reliable</h2>



<p>Whittaker emphasized that agentic AI isn’t just intrusive and vulnerable to threats; it’s also unreliable. She said <strong>AI agents are probabilistic, not deterministic, and that each step they take in a task degrades their accuracy and the final action</strong>.</p>



<p>She said if an AI agent could perform each step with 95% accuracy–which currently isn’t possible–a 10-step task would yield an action with a ~59.9% success rate. And if you had a 30-step task, the success rate would be ~21.4%. Furthermore, if we used a more realistic accuracy rate of 90%, then a 30-step task would drop down to a success rate of 4.2%. She added that <strong>the best agent models failed 70% of the time</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-make-ai-agents-private-and-secure">How to make AI agents private and secure</h2>



<p><strong>Whittaker said there currently isn’t a solution for making AI agents preserve privacy, security, and control; there’s only triage</strong>, but companies can take steps now to mitigate it.</p>



<ol>
<li>Stop the reckless deployment of AI agents to avoid plain-text database access to malware.</li>



<li>Make opting out the default, with mandatory developer opt-ins.</li>



<li>AI companies must provide radical (or any) transparency about how everything works and make it auditable at the granular level.</li>
</ol>



<p>If the industry doesn’t heed Whittaker’s and Tiwari’s warnings, the age of agentic AI could be in jeopardy, primarily because consumers could quickly lose their trust in a technology that is already overhyped and over-invested in.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Happy New Year, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/bandcamp">r/bandcamp</a>!</p>

<p>Hope you all enjoyed the Holiday Guide (<a href="http://bandcamp.com/2025">bandcamp.com/2025</a>) and your 2025 Bandcamp recaps.</p>

<p>Something that always strikes us as we put together a roundup like this is the sheer quantity of human creativity and passion that artists express on Bandcamp every single day. The fact that Bandcamp is home to such a vibrant community of real people making incredible music is something we want to protect and maintain.    </p>

<p>Today, in line with that goal, we’re articulating our policy on generative AI. We want musicians to keep making music, and for fans to have confidence that the music they find on Bandcamp was created by humans.</p>

<p>Our guidelines for generative AI in music and audio are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Music and audio that is generated wholly or in substantial part by AI is <strong>not permitted</strong> on Bandcamp.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Any use of AI tools to impersonate other artists or styles is <strong>strictly prohibited</strong> in accordance with our existing policies prohibiting impersonation and intellectual property infringement.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you encounter music or audio that appears to be made entirely or with heavy reliance on generative AI, please use our reporting tools to flag the content for review by our team<strong>. We reserve the right to remove any music on suspicion of being AI generated.</strong></p>

<p>We will be sure to communicate any updates to the policy as the rapidly changing generative AI space develops. Given the response around this to our previous posts, we hope this news is welcomed. We wish you all an amazing 2026.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Bandcamp Support</p>

It had maps and illustrations and rivers of fire and vast subterranean oceans and air channels connecting every volcano on the planet. He wrote that “</span><em><a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/athanasius-underground/" rel="">the whole Earth is not solid but everywhere gaping, and hollowed with empty rooms and spaces, and hidden burrows.</a></em><span>”. Alongside comments like this, </span><em>Athanasius</em><span> identified the legendary lost island of Atlantis, pondered where one could find the remains of giants, and detailed the kinds of animals that lived in this lower world, including dragons. The book was based entirely on secondhand accounts, like travelers tales, miners reports, classical texts, so it was as comprehensive as it could’ve possibly been. </span></p><p><span>But </span><em>Athanasius</em><span> had never been underground and neither had anyone else, not really, not in a way that mattered. </span></p><p><span>Today, I am in San Francisco, the site of the 2026 J.P.

They do not appear in my life. They do not appear in anyone’s life that I know. I have put my boots on the ground to rectify this, and asked around, first casually and then less casually, “</span><em>Do you know anyone who has attended the JPM conference?</em><span>”, and then they nod, and then I refine the question to be, “</span><em>No, no, like, someone who has actually been in the physical conference space</em><span>”, then they look at me like I’ve asked if they know anyone who’s been to the moon. They know it happens. They assume someone goes. Not them, because, just like me, ordinary people like them do not go to the moon, but rather exist around the moon, having coffee chats and organizing little parties around it, all while trusting that the moon is being attended to.</span></p><p><a href="https://jpmannualhealthcareconference.com/" rel="">The conference has six focuses: </a><em>AI in Drug Discovery and Development, AI in Diagnostics, AI for Operational Efficiency, AI in Remote and Virtual Healthcare, AI and Regulatory Compliance</em><span>, and </span><em>AI Ethics and Data Privacy. </em><span>There is also a seventh theme over ‘</span><em>Keynote Discussions</em><span>’, the three of which are </span><em>The Future of AI in Precision Medicine</em><span>, </span><em>Ethical AI in Healthcare</em><span>, and </span><em>Investing in AI for Healthcare. </em><span>Somehow, every single thematic concept at this conference has converged onto artificial intelligence as the only thing worth seriously discussing.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Yfq!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a8d65dc-907f-41fb-bda4-2bfc815b24c9_2012x1290.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Yfq!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a8d65dc-907f-41fb-bda4-2bfc815b24c9_2012x1290.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Yfq!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a8d65dc-907f-41fb-bda4-2bfc815b24c9_2012x1290.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Yfq!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a8d65dc-907f-41fb-bda4-2bfc815b24c9_2012x1290.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Yfq!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a8d65dc-907f-41fb-bda4-2bfc815b24c9_2012x1290.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Yfq!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a8d65dc-907f-41fb-bda4-2bfc815b24c9_2012x1290.png" width="1456" height="934" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7a8d65dc-907f-41fb-bda4-2bfc815b24c9_2012x1290.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:934,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:353633,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.owlposting.com/i/178015385?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a8d65dc-907f-41fb-bda4-2bfc815b24c9_2012x1290.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Yfq!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a8d65dc-907f-41fb-bda4-2bfc815b24c9_2012x1290.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Yfq!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a8d65dc-907f-41fb-bda4-2bfc815b24c9_2012x1290.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Yfq!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a8d65dc-907f-41fb-bda4-2bfc815b24c9_2012x1290.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Yfq!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a8d65dc-907f-41fb-bda4-2bfc815b24c9_2012x1290.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Isn’t this strange? Surely, you must feel the same thing as me, the inescapable suspicion that the whole show is being put on by an unconscious Chinese Room, its only job to pass over semi-legible symbols over to us with no regards as to what they actually mean. In fact, this pattern is consistent across not only how the conference communicates itself, but also how biopharmaceutical news outlets discuss it. </p><p><span>Each year, </span><a href="https://endpoints.news/" rel="">Endpoints News</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.statnews.com/" rel="">STAT</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.biocentury.com/home" rel="">BioCentury</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/" rel="">FiercePharma</a><span> all publish extensive coverage of the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. I have read the articles they have put out, and none of it feels like it was written by someone who actually was at the event</span><strong>. </strong><span>There is no emotional energy, no personal anecdotes, all of it has been removed, shredded into one homogeneous, smoothie-like texture. The coverage contains phrases like “</span><em>pipeline updates</em><span>” and “</span><em>strategic priorities</em><span>” and “</span><em>catalysts expected in the second half</em><span>.” If the writers of these articles ever approach a human-like tenor, it is in reference to the conference’s “</span><em>tone</em><span>”. The tone is “</span><em>cautiously optimistic</em><span>.” The tone is “</span><em>more subdued than expected</em><span>.” The tone is “</span><em>mixed</em><span>.” What does this mean? What is a mixed tone? What is a cautiously optimistic tone? These are not descriptions of a place. They are more accurately descriptions of a sentiment, abstracted from any physical reality, hovering somewhere above the conference like a weather system.</span></p><p><span>I could write this coverage. I could write it from my horrible apartment in New York City, without attending anything at all. I could say: “</span><em>The tone at this year’s J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference was cautiously optimistic, with executives expressing measured enthusiasm about near-term catalysts while acknowledging macroeconomic headwinds</em><span>.” I made that up in fifteen seconds. Does it sound fake? It shouldn’t, because it sounds exactly like the coverage of a supposedly real thing that has happened every year for the last forty-four years. </span></p><p><span>Speaking of the astral body I mentioned earlier, there is an interesting historical parallel to draw there. In 1835, the </span><a href="https://www.nysun.com/" rel="">New York Sun</a><span> published a series of articles claiming that the astronomer </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Herschel" rel="">Sir John Herschel</a><span> had discovered life on the moon. Bat-winged humanoids, unicorns, temples made of sentient sapphire, that sort of stuff. The articles were detailed, describing not only these creatures appearance, but also their social behaviors and mating practices. All of these cited Herschel’s observations through a powerful new telescope. The series was a sensation. It was also, obviously, a hoax, the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Moon_Hoax" rel="">Great Moon Hoax</a><span> as it came to be known. Importantly, the hoax worked not because the details were plausible, but because they had the energy of genuine reporting: Herschel was a real astronomer, and telescopes were real, and the moon was real, so how could any combination that involved these three be fake?</span></p><p>To clarify: I am not saying the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference is a hoax. </p><p>What I am saying is that I, nor anybody, can tell the difference between the conference coverage and a very well-executed hoax. Consider that the Great Moon Hoax was walking a very fine tightrope between giving the appearance of seriousness, while also not giving away too many details that’d let the cat out of the bag. Here, the conference rhymes. </p><p>For example: photographs. You would think there would be photographs. The (claimed) conference attendees number in the thousands, many of them with smartphones, all of them presumably capable of pointing a camera at a thing and pressing a button. But the photographs are strange, walking that exact snickering line that the New York Sun walked. They are mostly photographs of the outside of the Westin St. Francis, or they are photographs of people standing in front of step-and-repeat banners, or they are photographs of the schedule, displayed on a screen, as if to prove that the schedule exists. But photographs of the inside with the panels, audience, the keynotes in progress; these are rare. And when I do find them, they are shot from angles that reveal nothing, that could be anywhere, that could be a Marriott ballroom in Cleveland.</p><p><span>Is this a conspiracy theory? You can call it that, but I have a very professional online presence, so I personally wouldn’t. In fact, I wouldn’t even say that the  J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference is not real, but rather that it is </span><em>real</em><span>, but not actually </span><em>materially</em><span> real. </span></p><p><span>To explain what I mean, we can rely on economist </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Schelling" rel="">Thomas Schelling</a><span> to help us out. Sixty-six years ago, Schelling proposed a thought experiment: if you had to meet a stranger in New York City on a specific day, with no way to communicate beforehand, where would you go? The answer, for most people, is Grand Central Station, at noon. Not because Grand Central Station is special. Not because noon is special. But because everyone knows that everyone </span><strong>else</strong><span> knows that Grand Central Station at noon is the obvious choice, and this mutual knowledge of mutual knowledge is enough to spontaneously produce coordination out of nothing. This, Grand Central Station and places just like it, are what’s known as a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)" rel="">Schelling point</a><span>. </span></p><p>Schelling points appear when they are needed, burnt into our genetic code, Pleistocene subroutines running on repeat, left over from when we were small and furry and needed to know, without speaking, where the rest of the troop would be when the leopards came. The J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, on the second week of January, every January, Westin St. Francis, San Francisco, is what happened when that ancient coordination instinct was handed an industry too vast and too abstract to organize by any other means. Something deep drives us to gather here, at this time, at this date. </p><p>To preempt the obvious questions: I don’t know why this particular location or time or demographic were chosen. I especially don’t know why J.P. Morgan of all groups was chosen to organize the whole thing. All of this simply is. </p><p>If you find any of this hard to believe, observe that the whole event is, structurally, a religious pilgrimage, and has all the quirks you may expect of a religious pilgrimage. And I don’t mean that as a metaphor, I mean it literally, in every dimension except the one where someone official admits it, and J.P. Morgan certainly won’t. </p><p>Consider the elements. A specific place, a specific time, an annual cycle, a journey undertaken by the faithful, the presence of hierarchy and exclusion, the production of meaning through ritual rather than content. The hajj requires Muslims to circle the Kaaba seven times. The J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference requires devotees of the biopharmaceutical industry to slither into San Francisco for five days, nearly all of them—in my opinion, all of them—never actually entering the conference itself, but instead orbiting it, circumambulating it, taking coffee chats in its gravitational field. The Kaaba is a cube containing, according to tradition, nothing, an empty room, the holiest empty room in the world. The Westin St. Francis is also, roughly, a cube. I am not saying these are the same thing. I am saying that we have, as a species, a deep and unexamined relationship to cubes. </p><p>This is my strongest theory so far. That the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference isn’t exactly real or unreal, but a mass-coordination social contract that has been unconsciously signed by everyone in this industry, transcending the need for an underlying referent. </p><p>My skeptical readers will protest at this, and they would be correct to do so. The story I have written out is clean, but it cannot be fully correct. Thomas Schelling was not so naive as to believe that Schelling points spontaneously generate out of thin air, there is always a reason, a specific, grounded reason, that their concepts become the low-energy metaphysical basins that they are. Grand Central Station is special because of the cultural gravitas it has accumulated through popular media. Noon is special because that is when the sun reaches its zenith. The Kaaba was worshipped because it was not some arbitrary cube; the cube itself was special, that it contained The Black Stone, set into the eastern corner, a relic that predates Islam itself, that some traditions claim fell from heaven.</p><p><span>And there are signs, if you know where to look, that the underlying referent for the Westin St. Francis status being a gathering area is </span><strong>physical</strong><span>. Consider the heat. It is January in San Francisco, usually brisk, yet the interior of the Westin St. Francis maintains a distinct, humid microclimate. Consider the low-frequency vibration in the lobby that ripples the surface of water glasses, but doesn’t seem to register on local, public seismographs. There is something about the building itself that feels distinctly alien. But, upon standing outside the building for long enough, you’ll have the nagging sensation that it is not something about the hotel that feels off, but rather, what lies within, underneath, and around the hotel. </span></p><p>There’s no easy way to sugarcoat this, so I’ll just come out and say it: it is possible that the entirety of California is built on top of one immensely large organism, and the particular spot in which the Westin St. Francis Hotel stands—335 Powell Street, San Francisco, 94102—is located directly above its beating heart. And that this is the primary organizing focal point for both the location and entire reason for the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. </p><p><span>I believe that the hotel maintains dozens of meter-thick polyvinyl chloride plastic tubes that have been threaded down through the basement, through the bedrock, through geological strata, and into the cardiovascular system of something that has been lying beneath the Pacific coast since before the Pacific coast existed. That the hotel is a singular, thirty-two story </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_venous_catheter" rel="">central line.</a><span> That, during the week of the conference, hundreds of gallons of drugs flow through these tubes, into the pulsating mass of the being, pouring down arteries the size of canyons across California. The dosing takes five days; hence the length of the conference.</span></p><p>And I do not believe that the drugs being administered here are simply sedatives. They are, in fact, the opposite of sedatives. The drugs are keeping the thing beneath California alive. There is something wrong with the creature, and a select group of attendees at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference have become its primary caretakers. </p><p>Why? The answer is obvious: there is nothing good that can come from having an organic creature that spans hundreds of thousands of square miles suddenly die, especially if that same creatures mass makes up a substantial portion of the fifth-largest economy on the planet, larger than India, larger than the United Kingdom, larger than most countries that we think of as significant. Maybe letting the nation slide off into the sea was an option at one point, but not anymore. California produces more than half of the fruits, vegetables, and nuts grown in the United States. California produces the majority of the world’s entertainment. California produces the technology that has restructured human communication. Nobody can afford to let the whole thing collapse. </p><p>So, perhaps it was decided that California must survive, at least for as long as possible. Hence Amgen. Hence Genentech. Hence the entire biotech revolution, which we are taught to understand as a triumph of science and entrepreneurship, a story about venture capital and recombinant DNA and the genius of the California business climate. The story is not false, but incomplete. The reason for the revolution was, above all else, because the creature needed medicine, and the old methods of making medicine were no longer adequate, and someone decided that the only way to save the patient was to create an entire industry dedicated to its care. </p><p>Why is drug development so expensive? Because the real R&amp;D costs are for the primary patient, the being underneath California, and human applications are an afterthought, a way of recouping investment. Why do so many clinical trials fail? For the same reason; the drugs are not meant for our species. Why is the industry concentrated in San Francisco, San Diego, Boston? Because these are monitoring stations, places where other intravenous lines have been drilled into other organs, other places where the creature surfaces close enough to reach. </p><p><span>Finally, consider the hotel itself. The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westin_St._Francis" rel="">Westin St. Francis was built in 1904</a><span>, and, throughout its entire existence, it has never, ever, even once, closed or stopped operating. The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake" rel="">1906 earthquake </a><span>leveled most of San Francisco, and the Westin St. Francis did not fall. It was damaged, yes, but it did not fall. The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Loma_Prieta_earthquake" rel="">1989 Loma Prieta earthquake</a><span> killed sixty-three people and collapsed a section of the Bay Bridge. Still, the Westin St. Francis did not fall. It cannot fall, because if it falls, the central line is severed, and if the central line is severed, the creature dies, and if the creature dies, we lose California, and if we lose California, our civilization loses everything that California has been quietly holding together. And so the Westin St. Francis has hosted every single J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference since 1983, has never missed one, has never even come close to missing one, and will not miss the next one, or the one after that, or any of the ones that follow.</span></p><p><span>If you think about it, this all makes a lot of sense. It may also seem very unlikely, but unlikely things have been known to happen throughout history. </span><em>Mundus Subterraneus</em><span> had a section on the “</span><em>seeds of metals</em><span>,” a theory that gold and silver grew underground like plants, sprouting from mineral seeds in the moist, oxygen-poor darkness. This was wrong, but the intuition beneath it was not entirely misguided. We now understand that the Earth’s mantle is a kind of eternal engine of astronomical size, cycling matter through subduction zones and volcanic systems, creating and destroying crust. </span><em>Athanasius</em><span> was wrong about the mechanism, but right about the structure. The earth is not solid. It is everywhere gaping, hollowed with empty rooms, and it is alive.</span></p></div></article></div><div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div><div><h3>Ready for more?</h3></div></div></div>]]></description>

		</header>
		<p>A lot of people want to make a website but don’t know where to start or they get stuck. That’s in part because our perception of what websites <strong>should be</strong> has changed so dramatically over the last 20 years.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>The “Hard” Way</h2>
		<p>It’s easy to forget how simple a website <strong>can</strong> be. A website can be just <strong>one page</strong>. It doesn’t even need CSS. You don’t need a content management system like <em>Wordpress</em>. All you have to do is write some HTML and drag that file to a server over FTP.</p>
		<p>For years now, people have tried to convince us that this is the “hard” way of making a website, but in reality, it may be the easiest.</p>
		<p>It doesn’t have to be super complicated. However, with this post, I will assume you’ve written at least some HTML and CSS before, and that you know how to upload files to a server. If you’ve never done these things, it may seem like I’m skipping over some things. I am.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Baby’s First HTML</h2>
		<p>Let me begin with what I think you <strong>shouldn’t</strong> start with. Don’t shop around for a CMS. Don’t even design or outline your website. Don’t buy a domain or hosting yet. Don’t set up a <em>GitHub</em> repository; I don’t care how fast you can make one.</p>
		<p>Instead, <strong>just write your first blog post</strong>. The very first thing I did was open <em>TextEdit</em> and write <a href="https://lmnt.me/blog/teenage-web.html">my first post</a> with HTML, <strong>ye olde way</strong>. Not with <em>Markdown</em>. Not with <em><a href="https://nova.app/">Nova</a></em> or <em><a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html">BBEdit</a></em> or another code editor. Just <em>TextEdit</em> <small>(in plain text)</small>. Try it, even if just this once. It’s kinda refreshing. You can go back to using a code editor later.</p>
		<p>Here’s what a draft of this blog post looks like:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;
		&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
		&lt;title&gt;How to Make a Damn Website&lt;/title&gt;
	&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="how-to-make-a-damn-website.html"&gt;How to Make a Damn Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;A lot of people want to make a website but don’t know where to start or they get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
		<p>This is honestly all you need. It’s kind of charming.</p>
		<p>Make sure you rely exclusively on HTML elements for your formatting. Your page should render clearly with raw HTML. Do not let yourself get distracted by writing CSS. Don’t even imagine the CSS you’ll use later. Don’t write in IDs or classes yet. Do yourself a favor and don’t make a single <code>div</code> element.</p>
		<p>Just write the post in the <strong>plainest HTML</strong>. And don’t you dare write a “Hello World” post or a “Lorem Ipsum” post. Write an <strong>actual blog post</strong>. If you want, make it about why you’re making a website.</p>
		<p>Writing this way helps you stay focused on writing <strong>for the web</strong>. The most important thing here is <strong>shipping something</strong>. You can <small>(and should)</small> update your site later. Now, name the HTML file something sensible, like the post name.</p>
		<pre><code>how-to-make-a-damn-website.html</code></pre>
		<p>Finished? Great. If you have a domain and hosting, make a new folder on your server called <strong>blog</strong> and upload your first post in there. Don’t worry about index pages yet. You have only one post, there’s not much to index. We’ll get there.</p>
		<p>If you <strong>don’t</strong> have a domain or hosting yet, now’s the time to buckle down and do that. Unfortunately, I don’t have good advice for you here. Just know that it’s going to be stupid and tedious and bad and unfun. That’s just the way this is.</p>
		<p>Try not to let it deter you. Once you have the ability to upload files to an FTP server, you’ve reached the “set it and forget it” phase.</p>
		<p>Direct your web browser to the HTML file you uploaded. <strong>Wow!</strong> There it is. A real, actual page on the web! You shipped it. Congratulations. Times New Roman, black on white. Hyperlinks that are blue and underlined. Useful. Classic.</p>
		<p>Look at your unstyled HTML page and appreciate it for what it is. Always remember, <strong>this is all a website has to be</strong>. Good websites can be reduced to this and still work.</p>
		<p><strong>A broken escalator is just stairs.</strong> Even if it’s a little less convenient, it remains <strong>functional</strong>. This is important.</p>
		<p>If you get this far, I want you to know <strong>this is truly the hardest part</strong>. Some people will ignore what I’ve said. They will spend significant time designing a website, hunting around for a good CMS, doing a wide variety of busywork, neglecting the part where they write actual content for their site. But if you shipped a single blog post, <strong>you have a website</strong>, and <strong>they don’t</strong>.</p>
		<p>A website is <strong>nothing</strong> without content. You can spend months preparing to make a website, tacking up what I’m sure was intended to be a “temporary” page telling people that you’re “working on a new website,” but it will inevitably become a permanent reminder that you haven’t done it yet. So focus on what matters, and ship <strong>one blog post</strong>. Do the rest later.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Really Simple Syndication</h2>
		<p>You may think CSS is the next logical step, or maybe an index page, but I don’t think so. It takes only a few minutes to <strong>hand-write an XML file</strong>, and once it’s done, people will be able to read your blog via an RSS reader.</p>
		<p>On your site, <strong>you’re in control of publishing now</strong>. When you post to your blog, part of the process is syndicating it to those who want to stay updated. If you provide an RSS feed, people can follow it. If you don’t, they can’t.</p>
		<p><strong>While the best time to make an RSS feed was 20 years ago, the second best time is now.</strong></p>
		<p>It should be noted that most people who have an RSS feed are probably <strong>not</strong> making it manually, so you won’t find a lot of documentation out there for doing it this way. But it’s not too hard. And once you make a habit, it’ll be a totally reasonable component of your publishing flow.</p>
		<p>Here’s what my XML file looks like <small>(without any entries)</small>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;rss version="2.0" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"&gt;
	&lt;channel&gt;

		&lt;title&gt;LMNT&lt;/title&gt;
		&lt;link&gt;https://lmnt.me/&lt;/link&gt;
		&lt;description&gt;Louie Mantia’s weblog.&lt;/description&gt;
		&lt;language&gt;en-us&lt;/language&gt;
		&lt;atom:link href="https://lmnt.me/feed.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml" /&gt;

				&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="how-to-make-a-damn-website.html"&gt;How to Make a Damn Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;A lot of people want to make a website but don’t know where to start or they get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

			]]&gt;&lt;/description&gt;
		&lt;/item&gt;

	&lt;/channel&gt;
&lt;/rss&gt;</code></pre>
		<p>The <code>item</code> element represents an entry, and goes inside the <code>channel</code> element as well. There are a few self-explanatory elements for the post metadata <small>(<code>title</code>, <code>pubDate</code>, <code>guid</code>, and <code>link</code>)</small>, but the content inside the <code>description</code> element can be the <strong>same HTML</strong> from your actual post. Handy!</p>
		<p>Writing your first post with HTML and understanding how it looks “unstyled” really works in your favor here, because <strong>RSS readers use their own stylesheets</strong>. How they render pages will not be too different from how a raw HTML page is rendered in your browser. If you make your own stylesheet too early, you may neglect how the raw HTML could be parsed in an RSS reader.</p>
		<p>For the <code>pubDate</code>, you can use <strong>GMT</strong> time. Ask Siri what time it is in Reykjavik, and enter that. You can use your local time zone instead, but be sure it’s <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/error/InvalidRFC2822Date.html">formatted correctly</a>. Also, note that it needs to be <strong>24-hour time</strong>.</p>
		<p>If you have images or other media in your post, be sure to use the <strong>absolute URL</strong> to a resource rather than a <strong>relative</strong> one. Relative URLs are fine for content that only lives on your site, but when you syndicate via RSS, that content loads outside of your website. Absolute URLs are better for content <strong>inside</strong> your blog posts, especially in the XML.</p>
		<p>Once you’ve got your first post in the XML file, upload it to the root folder of your website. If you don’t already have an RSS reader, get one. I recommend <em><a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a></em>. Go to the XML file in your browser, and it should automatically open in your RSS reader and let you subscribe.</p>
		<p>There it is! Your blog post is on the web and now <strong>also</strong> available via RSS! You can share that link now.</p>
		<p>Now would be a good time to reference your RSS feed <strong>in your HTML</strong>. You’ll want to do this on all pages going forward, too. It helps browsers and plugins detect that there’s an RSS feed for people to subscribe to.</p>
		<pre><code>&lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="LMNT" href="https://lmnt.me/feed.xml" /&gt;</code></pre>
		<p>When you add a new <code>item</code> <small>(a new blog post)</small>, put it <strong>above the previous one</strong> in your XML file. Keep in mind that your XML file will be updated periodically from devices that subscribe to it. RSS readers will be downloading this file when updating, so keep an eye on the file size. It probably won’t ever be that big, because it’s just text, but it’s customary to keep only a certain amount of recent entries in the XML file, or a certain time period. But there’s no rule here.</p>
		<p>The <code>guid</code> should be a unique string. Some people use URLs thinking they’re unique, but those can change. The <strong>right</strong> way is to generate a unique string for each post, which you can do easily with my app <em><a href="https://lmnt.me/apps/#tulip">Tulip</a></em>.</p>
		<p>Changing the <code>guid</code> <small>(unique identifier)</small> for your posts makes an RSS reader think it’s a different entry, resulting in a post being marked “unread.” If you go the route of using a URL as your <code>guid</code> for each post, you’ll want to think harder about the file structure of your website, right? It’s <strong>probably</strong> fine if you change your file structure once or twice <small>(I did)</small>, but just be sure to update your <code>link</code> elements in the RSS feed, and <strong>redirect</strong> old URLs to new ones with an <strong>.htaccess</strong> file. Just don’t change the contents of the <code>guid</code> element.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Indexing…</h2>
		<p>Alright, we can make index pages now. This is going to be super easy, because you don’t have a lot to index yet.</p>
		<p>At the <strong>root</strong>, you want a link to the <strong>blog</strong> directory, and at the <strong>blog</strong> directory, you want a link to your <strong>first post</strong>. Put titles on each page, maybe a link back to the home page from your blog index. If you want, write a little description of your site on the root index.</p>
		<p>Keep using basic HTML! Titles can be <code>h1</code>, and descriptions can be <code>p</code>. Keep it simple.
		</p><p>Once you got those uploaded, you got <strong>three pages</strong> and an <strong>RSS feed</strong>. You’re doing great!</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Developing Blogging Habits</h2>
		<p>I recommend writing a couple more posts next. Try using some HTML elements that you didn’t use in the first post, maybe an <code>hr</code> element. Fancy! <code>ol</code> and <code>ul</code>. Maybe some <code>img</code>, <code>video</code>, and <code>audio</code> elements.</p>
		<p>In addition to being more posts for your blog, these will also help prioritize which elements need styling, providing you with a few sample pages to check while you write CSS.</p>
		<p>Upload the posts as you write them, one after the next, adding them to your XML file. Don’t forget to update your index pages, too. Always check your links and your feed.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>One Style at a Time</h2>
		<p>Before you get ahead of yourself with <strong>layout</strong>, I recommend first styling the <strong>basic HTML elements</strong> you already defined in your first few posts: <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code>, <code>hr</code>, <code>p</code>, <code>strong</code>, <code>em</code>, <code>ol</code>, <code>ul</code>. Define the <code>body</code> font and width, text sizes, and colors.</p>
		<p>Like the rest of your site, stylesheets are <strong>mutable</strong>. Expect them to change with your website. <strong>Incremental updates</strong> are what makes this whole process work. Ship <strong>tiny</strong> updates to your CSS. You can upload your stylesheet in a second. Heck, work directly on the server if you want. <strong>I did that.</strong></p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Then Keep Doing It</h2>
		<p>If you’ve done all this, then you’ve cleared the hurdle. Now you get to just keep doing the fun stuff. Write more blog posts. Make more web pages. It’s your website, you can make pages for <strong>anything you want</strong>. You can style them however you want. You can update people via RSS whenever you make something new.</p>
		<p>Manually making a website like this may seem silly to engineers who would rather build or rely on systems that automate this stuff. But it doesn’t seem like there’s actually a whole lot that needs automation, does it?</p>
		<p>A lot of modern solutions <strong>may not save time</strong> as much as they <strong>introduce complexity</strong> and reliance on more tools than you need. This whole process is not that complex.</p>
		<p>It’s not doing this manually that’s hard.</p>
		<p><strong>The hard part is just shipping.</strong></p>

This wasn't degradation—it was <strong>digital amputation</strong>.</p></div><div><h2>IPv4: SEVERE DEGRADATION</h2><h3>82% Visibility Loss</h3><p>IPv4 peer visibility crashed from <strong>313 peers</strong> to just <strong>56 peers</strong>—an 82% reduction.</p><p>This explains why some connectivity remained: the state couldn't completely kill IPv4 without severing its own access. IPv6, with no such dependencies, was simply switched off.</p></div></div></div><div><div><h2>ACT VI — THE LAST HOPE</h2><h3>Looking to the Sky</h3><p>When the ground-based internet died, people looked up.<strong>Starlink</strong>—Elon Musk's satellite network—became the last lifeline.</p><p>Small dishes, smuggled across borders, beamed hope from orbit. For a moment, it seemed the sky might save them.</p></div><div><h2>THE DARKEST HOUR</h2><h3>Even Space Wasn't Safe</h3><p>The regime deployed military-grade GPS jammers—<strong>Murmansk-BN</strong> and <strong>Krasukha-4</strong> systems, likely supplied by Russia.</p><p>Signal quality crashed from <strong>99%</strong> to <strong>15%</strong>.

Israeli chess player and content creator – which was approved in December 2023.</p><p>“My followings on Instagram (1.2 million), Twitch (108,000) and YouTube (799,000) were included as part of my profile, and I listed my follower counts on each platform,” she said. After her visa approval, she moved to Charlotte, North Carolina – widely considered the chess capital of the United States.</p><p>While a certain number of followers may not be an automatic ticket to the US, one viral music group has been trying their luck. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@boy.throb" data-link-name="in body link">Boy Throb</a>, comprising Anthony Key, Evan Papier, Zachary Sobania and Darshan Magdum, spent the past few months campaigning to reach 1 million followers on TikTok so that Magdum could use the stat on his O-1 visa application. Clad in matching pink jumpsuits, the three US-based bandmates danced together on screen to parody lyrics of hit songs, while Magdum was edited in from India.</p><p>Within a month of their first post, Boy Throb <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/is-boy-throb-real-or-fake-meet-the-divisive-boy-band-visa-issues-interview" data-link-name="in body link">reached their goal of 1 million followers.</a> Whether it will help Magdum get a visa remains unclear.</p><p>“Honestly, the entire immigration process has been so complicated and there have been so many people who don’t believe us when we say we’re doing everything in our power to get Darshan here,” the group said.</p><p>“We’re not sure how much longer we want to keep going without Darshan here and the process has been really expensive,” they added. In total, the band has spent more than $10,000 in legal and processing fees.</p><p>The rise in content creators applying for visas given out on the basis of “extraordinary ability” has garnered a variety of reactions.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><a href="https://eieio.games/blog/two-heads-arent-better-than-one/"></a><div><p>Three heads are certainly more fun</p><p>Dec 9, 2025</p></div></div>
<p>You’re playing a game with your lying friends Alice and Bob.</p>
<p>Bob flips a coin and shows it to Alice. Alice tells you what she saw - but she lies 20% of the time. Then you take your best guess on whether the coin is heads or tails.</p>
<p>Your best strategy is to trust whatever Alice says. You’re right 80% of the time.</p>
<p>Now Bob joins in. He makes up his mind independent of Alice, and he <em>also</em> lies 20% of the time <a>1</a>.</p>
<div data-is-footnote="true"><p><span>1</span></p><p>Your friends are all liars!</p></div>
<p>You were right 80% of the time by trusting Alice.</p>
<p>How much better can you do with Bob’s help?</p>
<!-- -->
<h2 id="toc:heres-some-empty-space-for-you-to-think">Here’s some empty space for you to think</h2>
<p>I’m going to give you the answer below. So here’s some empty space for you to think in case you want to do the math yourself.</p>
<!-- -->

<h2 id="toc:alright-lets-do-some-math">Alright, let’s do some math</h2>
<p>The answer is 0% - you don’t do any better! You’re still exactly 80% to get the right answer.</p>
<p>To establish this, let’s write a simple simulation. We’ll flip a coin a million times, ask our friends what they saw, and observe the results.</p>
<p>For our strategy, we’ll look at a fact pattern (like “Alice says heads”), figure out what’s most likely (“the coin is heads”), and say “we guess the coin flip correctly whenever the most likely outcome occurs for this fact pattern” <a>2</a>.</p>
<div data-is-footnote="true"><p><span>2</span></p><p>Given that Bob and Alice decide independently and aren’t playing
adversarially, “guess the most likely outcome” is optimal here. It may not be
optimal if the game was adversarial, although I think that’s a trickier
question than it might first seem.</p></div>
<p>Here’s the code for that simulation. We’ll start with the easy case (just Alice):</p>

<p>This gives us:</p>
<pre><code><span>% python heads.py
</span><span>A:T - chances -  H 20.0% | T 80.0% | occurs 50.0% of the time
</span><span>A:H - chances -  H 80.0% | T 20.0% | occurs 50.0% of the time
</span><span>
</span><span>Our accuracy: 80.0%
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now let’s add Bob to the simulation. We see something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>% python heads.py
</span><span>A:T, B:T - chances -  H  6.0% | T 94.0% | occurs 34.0% of the time
</span><span>A:H, B:T - chances -  H 50.0% | T 50.0% | occurs 16.0% of the time

</span><span>A:T, B:H - chances -  H 50.0% | T 50.0% | occurs 16.0% of the time
</span><span>
</span><span>Our accuracy: 80.0%
</span></code></pre>
<p>That’s weird! But perhaps this gives you an intuition for what’s happening. By introducing a second player, <em>we introduce the possibility of a tie</em>.</p>
<p>A decent amount of the time, Alice and Bob agree. <em>Most</em> (~94%) of the time when that happens, they’re telling the truth. Occasionally they’re both lying, but that’s pretty unlikely.</p>
<p>But a meaningful portion of the time (32%) Alice says heads and Bob says tails, or vice versa. And in that case we don’t know anything at all! Alice and Bob are equally trustworthy and they disagreed - we’d be better off if we’d just gone and asked Alice <a>3</a>!</p>
<div data-is-footnote="true"><p><span>3</span></p><p>I am deeply curious whether anyone else was read the book “Go Ask Alice” by
their middle school science teacher in order to scare them straight or whether
that was specific to my middle school experience.</p></div>
<h3 id="toc:lets-prove-it">Let’s prove it</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve simulated this result, let’s walk through each case assuming that the coin landed on heads.</p>
<pre><code><span>- both tell the truth
</span><span>Alice: Heads (80%), Bob: Heads (80%)
</span><span>happens 80% * 80% = 64% of the time
</span><span>we always guess correctly in this case
</span><span>
</span><span>- both lie
</span><span>Alice: Tails (20%), Bob: Tails (20%)
</span><span>happens 20% * 20% = 4% of the time
</span><span>we never guess correctly in this case
</span><span>
</span><span>- alice tells the truth, bob lies
</span><span>Alice: Heads (80%), Bob: Tails (20%)
</span><span>happens 80% * 20% = 16% of the time
</span><span>we guess at random in this case; we're right 50% of the time
</span><span>
</span><span>- alice lies, bob tells the truth
</span><span>Alice: Tails (20%), Bob: Heads (80%)
</span><span>happens 20% * 80% = 16% of the time
</span><span>we guess at random in this case; we're right 50% of the time
</span><span>
</span><span>Our total chance to guess correctly is:
</span><span>64% + 16% / 2 + 16% / 2 = 64% + 8% + 8% = 80%
</span></code></pre>
<p>There’s something beautiful here. Our total chance to guess remains at 80% because our additional chance to guess correctly when Alice and Bob agree is perfectly offset by the chance that Alice and Bob disagree!</p>
<h3 id="toc:meet-charlie-and-david">Meet Charlie (and David)</h3>
<p>If our friend Charlie - who also lies 20% of the time - joins the fun, our odds improve substantially. If Bob and Alice disagree, Charlie can act as a tiebreaker.</p>

<p>And this continues, on and on, forever (as long as we have enough friends). If our number <code>N</code> of friends is odd, our chances of guessing correctly don’t improve when we move to <code>N+1</code> friends.</p>
<h2 id="toc:is-there-a-name-for-this">Is there a name for this?</h2>
<p>As far as I can tell, there’s no name for this weird little phenomenon. But it <em>does</em> appear, implicitly, in voting literature.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet%27s_jury_theorem">Condorcet’s jury theorem</a> is a famous theorem in political science. It states:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a group of voters of size <code>N</code></li>
<li>…and they all vote, independently, on an issue with a correct answer</li>
<li>…and each voter votes the “right” way with probability <code>P</code></li>
<li>…and we make whatever decision the majority of the voters vote for</li>
<li>…then if <code>P &gt; 50%</code>, the chance that we make the right decision approaches 100% as we add more voters</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds a fair bit like our coin flipping problem. Here’s a simplifying assumption that Wikipedia makes when proving the theorem:</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot from the wikipedia article on Condorcet's Jury Theorem. Full text: Proof 1: Calculating the probability that two additional voters change the outcome
To avoid the need for a tie-breaking rule, we assume n is odd. Essentially the same argument works for even n if ties are broken by adding a single voter." loading="lazy" width="1156" height="270" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://eieio.games/images/two-heads-arent-better-than-one/from-wikipedia.webp"></p>
<p>Hah! The proof explicitly recognizes (and dodges) the even-voter case precisely because that voter doesn’t add any information.</p>
<h2 id="toc:why-did-i-write-this">Why did I write this?</h2>
<p>I stumbled upon this result while writing a simulation for a more complex problem. I was <em>so</em> surprised at the simulation results that I assumed that I had a bug in my code. And when I walked through the math by hand I was absolutely delighted.</p>
<p>I suspect some of the surprise for me was because I typically encounter problems like these in the context of betting, not voting. If we’re <em>betting</em> on coin flips, we’re certainly excited to bet more if Alice and Bob agree than if we’re just listening to Alice.</p>
<p>But voting is a different beast; our outcome is binary. There’s no way to harvest the additional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value">EV</a> from the increased confidence Bob sometimes gives us.</p>
<p>By the way - I encountered this problem while working with a friend at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=4d29374c1894b0c33520021a254e0591">The Recurse Center</a> (a writers retreat for programmers). It’s a great place to get nerd sniped by silly math problems; If you enjoyed this blog consider <a href="https://www.recurse.com/apply">applying</a>!</p>
<p>Anyway. I hope this delights you like it did me.</p></article></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.greptile.com/blog/github-ids">https://www.greptile.com/blog/github-ids</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46602591">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>I was recently building a feature for Greptile (an AI-powered code review tool), when I hit a weird snag with GitHub's API.</p>
<p>The feature should have been simple: I wanted to add clickable links to GitHub PR comments, so users could jump directly from our reviews to relevant GitHub discussions. We already stored the comment IDs, so I just needed to construct the URLs.</p>
<p>The problem was, when I tested it, the links didn't work.</p>
<p>Searching through <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/using-global-node-ids">GitHub's documentation</a> for answers revealed that their team maintains two separate ID systems. We'd been using GitHub's GraphQL API, which returns <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/scalars#id">node IDs</a> like <code>PRRC_kwDOL4aMSs6Tkzl8</code>. GitHub designed these node IDs to uniquely identify any object across its entire system. But web URLs required database IDs, integer values visible in URLs and often associated with REST responses, like <code>2475899260</code>.</p>
<p>I was looking at either backfilling millions of records or migrating our entire database, and neither sounded fun. So I did what any annoyed engineer would do: I stared at these IDs for way too long, looking for a way out of the migration.</p>
<p>And I found it.</p>

<p>I looked for a relationship between these two ID formats. I pulled up a few of our stored node IDs and opened the corresponding PR comments from the same pull request in my editor:</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Node ID</th><th>Database ID</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span>PRRC_kwDOL4aMSs</span><span>6Tkzl8</span></td><td>2475<span>899260</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>PRRC_kwDOL4aMSs</span><span>6Tkzya</span></td><td>2475<span>900058</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>PRRC_kwDOL4aMSs</span><span>6Tkz3e</span></td><td>2475<span>900382</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>The database IDs incremented sequentially, and the node IDs were almost identical too, differing only in their last few characters. GitHub's documentation mentioned that node IDs are base64 encoded. I tried decoding just the part after <code>PRRC_</code>:</p>
<pre><div><pre><code>def base64_2_int(s):
    base64_part = s.split("_")[1]
    return int.from_bytes(base64.b64decode(base64_part))
</code></pre></div></pre>
<p>The decoded values were very long (96 bit) integers:</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Node ID</th><th>Decoded Integer</th><th>Database ID</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span>PRRC_kwDOL4aMSs6Tkz</span><span>l8</span></td><td><span>454952701279253740627272</span><span>15484</span></td><td>24758992<span>60</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>PRRC_kwDOL4aMSs6Tkz</span><span>ya</span></td><td><span>454952701279253740627272</span><span>16282</span></td><td>24759000<span>58</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>PRRC_kwDOL4aMSs6Tkz</span><span>3e</span></td><td><span>454952701279253740627272</span><span>16606</span></td><td>24759003<span>82</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>The decoded integers were incremented by 798, exactly matching the database ID increment. The database ID had to be embedded in there somewhere.</p>

<p>Since both values were changing by the same amount, and the decoded value was 96 bits, I figured the database ID was likely embedded in the lower 32 bits of the node ID. I wrote a quick test:</p>
<pre><div><pre><code>def node_id_to_database_id(s):
    decoded = int.from_bytes(base64.b64decode(s.split("_")[1]))
    # Mask to keep only the lower 32 bits
    return decoded &amp; ((1 &lt;&lt; 32) - 1)

node_id_to_database_id("PRRC_kwDOL4aMSs6Tkzl8")
# Returns: 2475899260
</code></pre></div></pre>
<p>It worked! The database ID was just the last 32 bits of the decoded node ID. I could skip the entire migration, and extract what I needed with a simple bitmask operation.</p>
<p>After the relief sunk in, I couldn't help but ask, "If the database ID only used the last 32 bits out of the 96 total bits, what were the first 64 bits being used for?"</p>
<p>Since the node ID is a global identifier across all of GitHub, I assumed that the extra 64 bits had to encode either the object type or an id to another resource that "owned" the current node. I wanted to see if I could decode them the same way I'd decoded the database ID.</p>

<p>To understand what was in those 64 bits, I started <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer">querying different GitHub objects</a>. My test repository returned the familiar <code>PRRC_</code> format for everything. I tried the first famous repository that came to mind, <code>torvalds/linux</code>, to see if the pattern held.</p>
<p>The response was a completely different base64 encoded string:</p>
<pre><code>MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzI1Mjk4
MDQ6VHJlZTIzMjUyOTg6NzIwMWJmYjkyOGIyOWU4MGIwMDVkYTE1OTc4MzQ1ZjIzYmEwZmY5Yg==
MDQ6QmxvYjIzMjUyOTg6ZjM3MWExM2I0ZDE5MmQyZTM3ZDcwMTdiNjNlMzNkZmE3YzY3Mzc4Zg==
</code></pre>
<p>When I decoded these they showed the following:</p>
<pre><div><pre><code>base64.b64decode("MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzI1Mjk4")
# Returns: b'010:Repository2325298'
</code></pre></div></pre>
<p>The Linux repository was using a completely different format. I realized the repository was created in 2011. By picking an old repository, I'd accidentally stumbled onto GitHub's legacy ID format which was quite simple:</p>
<pre><code>[Object Type Number]:[Object Type Name][Database ID]
</code></pre>
<p>That repository ID (<code>010:Repository2325298</code>) had a clear structure: <code>010</code> is some type enum, followed by a colon, the word <code>Repository</code>, and then the database ID <code>2325298</code>. Since repositories are just containers, I wanted to see if git objects like trees would reveal more complexity:</p>
<pre><div><pre><code>base64.b64decode("MDQ6VHJlZTIzMjUyOTg6NzIwMWJmYjkyOGI...")
# Returns: b'04:Tree2325298:7201bfb928b29e80b005da15978345f23ba0ff9b'
</code></pre></div></pre>
<p>That's the enum again, the word <code>Tree</code>, the repository ID, and the tree SHA.</p>
<p>It was apparent that GitHub had two systems for ID'ing their internal objects. Somewhere in GitHub's codebase, there's an if-statement checking when a repository was created to decide which ID format to return.</p>
<p>I started mapping out which objects used which format. The pattern wasn't as simple as "old repos use old IDs, new repos use new IDs":</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Format</th><th>Example</th><th>Usage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Legacy</td><td>MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzI1Mjk4</td><td>Old repositories like torvalds/linux</td></tr><tr><td>New</td><td>PRRC_kwDOL4aMSs6Tkzl8</td><td>Newer repositories and most objects</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>Old repositories kept their legacy IDs, while newer ones were issued IDs following the new format. But the split isn't clean; GitHub still uses the legacy format for some object types, like Users, even when newly created. New objects in old repositories sometimes get new IDs, sometimes don't. It depends on their creation date.</p>
<p>Surely the new format had some benefit that warranted this messy migration. It shouldn't be too hard to create a more efficient IDing system than base64 encoding the string representation of an enum and the object name. This information could easily be packed into those 64 extra bits that I still had to understand.</p>

<p>GitHub's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/migrating-graphql-global-node-ids">migration guide</a> tells developers to treat the new IDs as opaque strings and treat them as references. However it was clear that there was some underlying structure to these IDs as we just saw with the bitmasking. My best guess was that it used some binary serialization format, so I could just test a bunch to see what worked.</p>
<p>This is when I came across <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://msgpack.org/">MessagePack</a>, a compact binary serialization format. It seemed promising as it was frequently used in Ruby projects, and GitHub's backend is built on Ruby. I tried decoding it:</p>
<pre><div><pre><code>import msgpack
import base64

def decode_new_node_id(node_id):
    prefix, encoded = node_id.split('_')
    packed = base64.b64decode(encoded)
    return msgpack.unpackb(packed)

decode_new_node_id("PRRC_kwDOL4aMSs6Tkzl8")
# Returns: [0, 47954445, 2475899260]
</code></pre></div></pre>
<p>It worked. The new format uses MessagePack to encode the relevant IDs into an array.</p>
<p>The structure made sense once I saw it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First element (0):</strong> Still unclear. Probably a version identifier, but if you know what this is for, please email me at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:soohoon@greptile.com">soohoon@greptile.com</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Second element (47954445):</strong> The repository's database ID. This provides the context needed to make the ID global. Pull requests, issues, and comments are all usually scoped to a repository.</li>
<li><strong>Third element (2475899260):</strong> The object's database ID.</li>
</ul>
<p>Different object types sometimes have different array lengths. Repositories only need <code>[0, repository_database_id]</code>. Commits include the git SHA: <code>[0, repository_database_id, commit_sha]</code>. The first element is always 0, and repository-scoped objects include both the repository ID and the specific object identifier. Since the database ID of the comment is the last element in the array, when bitmasking for the lower 32 bits we are able extract just that.</p>

<p>What started as a URL generation problem turned into "reverse-engineering" and exploring of GitHub's ID system.</p>
<p>Putting it all together, for modern GitHub node IDs you can use:</p>
<pre><div><pre><code>import base64
import msgpack

def node_id_to_database_id(node_id):
    prefix, encoded = node_id.split('_')
    packed = base64.b64decode(encoded)

                    <div>
                        <p>Throughout 2025, I spoke a few times about our home energy solution, including our grid usage, our solar array and our Tesla Powerwall batteries. Now that I have a full year of data, I wanted to take a look at exactly how everything is working out, and, in alignment with our objectives, how much money we've saved!</p><h4 id="our-setup">Our setup</h4><p>Just to give a quick overview of what we're working with, here are the details on our solar, battery and tariff situation:</p><ul><li>☀️Solar Panels: We have 14x Perlight solar panels managed by Enphase that make up the 4.2kWp array on our roof, and they produce energy when the sun shines, which isn't as often as I'd like in the UK!</li><li>🔋Tesla Powerwalls: We have 3x Tesla Powerwall 2 in our garage that were purchased to help us load-shift our energy usage. Electricity is very expensive in the UK and moving from peak usage which is 05:30 to 23:30 at ~£0.28/kWh, to off-peak usage, which is 23:30 - 05:30 at ~£0.07/kWh, is a significant cost saving.</li><li>💡Smart Tariff: My wife and I both drive electric cars and our electricity provider, Octopus Energy, has a Smart Charging tariff. If we plug in one of our cars, and cheap electricity is available, they will activate the charger and allow us to use the off-peak rate, even at peak times.</li></ul><p>Now that we have some basic info, let's get into the details!</p><h4 id="grid-import">Grid Import</h4><p>I have 3 sources of data for our grid import, and all of them align pretty well in terms of their measurements. I have the amount our electricity supplier charged us for, I have my own CT Clamp going via a Shelly EM that feeds in to Home Assistant, and I have the Tesla Gateway which controls all grid import into our home.</p><p>Starting with my Home Assistant data, these are the relevant readings. </p><p>Jan 1st 2025 - 15,106.10 kWh<br>Dec 31st 2025 - 36,680.90 kWh<br>Total: 21,574.80 kWh<br><strong>Total Import: 21.6 MWh</strong></p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1138" height="503" srcset="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/image-3.png 600w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/image-3.png 1000w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-3.png 1138w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>As you can see in the graph, during the summer months we have slightly lower grid usage and the graph line climbs at a lower rate, but overall, we have pretty consistent usage. Looking at what our energy supplier charged, us for, that comes in slightly lower.</p><p><strong>Total Import: 20.1 MWh</strong></p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-8.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="997" height="577" srcset="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/image-8.png 600w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-8.png 997w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I'm going to use the figure provided by our energy supplier in my calculations because their equipment is likely more accurate than mine, and also, what they're charging me is the ultimate thing that matters. The final source is our Tesla Gateway, which shows us having imported 21.0 MWh.</p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-11.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1290" height="1568" srcset="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/image-11.png 600w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/image-11.png 1000w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-11.png 1290w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It's great to see how all of these sources of data align so poorly! 😅</p><h4 id="grid-export">Grid Export</h4><p>Looking at our export, the graph tells a slightly different story because, as you can see, we didn't really start exporting properly until June, when our export tariff was activated. Prior to June, it simply wasn't worth exporting as we were only getting £0.04/kWh but at the end of May, our export tariff went live and we were then getting paid £0.15/kWh for export. My <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/automation-improvements-after-a-tesla-powerwall-outage/?ref=scotthelme.co.uk" rel="noreferrer">first</a> and <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/v2-hacking-my-tesla-powerwalls-to-be-the-ultimate-home-energy-solution/?ref=scotthelme.co.uk" rel="noreferrer">second</a> blog posts cover the full details of this change when it happened if you'd like to read them but for now, just note that it will change the calculations a little later as we only had export for 60% of the year.</p><p><strong>Total Export: 6.0 MWh</strong></p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-9.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="989" height="582" srcset="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/image-9.png 600w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-9.png 989w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>With our grid export covered the final piece of the puzzle is to look at our solar.</p><h4 id="solar-production">Solar Production</h4><p>We're really not in the best part of the world for generating solar power, but we've still managed to produce quite a bit of power. Even in the most ideal, perfect scenario, our solar array can only generate 4.2kW of power, and we're definitely never getting near that. Our peak production was 2.841kW on 8th July at 13:00, and you can see our full annual production graph here. </p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-12.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1582" height="513" srcset="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/image-12.png 600w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/image-12.png 1000w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-12.png 1582w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Looking at the total energy production for the entire array, you can see it pick up through the sunnier months but remain quite flat during the darker days of the year.</p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1132" height="504" srcset="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/image-2.png 600w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/image-2.png 1000w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-2.png 1132w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Jan 1st 2025 - 2.709 MWh<br>Dec 31st 2025 - 5.874 MWh<br><strong>Solar Production: 3.2 MWh</strong></p><p>Just to confirm, I also took a look at the Enphase app, which is drawing it's data from the same source to be fair, and it agrees with the 3.2 MWh of generation.</p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1157" height="560" srcset="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/image-4.png 600w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/image-4.png 1000w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-4.png 1157w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h4 id="calculating-the-savings">Calculating the savings</h4><p>This isn't exactly straightforward because of the combination of our solar array and excess import/export due to the batteries, but here are the numbers I'm currently working on.</p><p><strong>Total Import: 20.1 MWh<br>Total Export: 6.0 MWh<br>Solar Production: 3.2 MWh</strong></p><p>That gives us a total household usage of 17.3 MWh.</p><p>(20.1 MWh import + 3.2 MWh solar) − 6.0 MWh export = 17.3 MWh usage</p><p>If we didn't have the solar array providing power, the full 17.3 MWh of consumption would have been chargeable from our provider. If we had only the solar and no battery, assuming a perfect ability to utilise our solar generation, only 14.1 MWh of our usage would need to be imported. The cost of those units of solar generation can be viewed at the peak and off-peak rates as follows.</p><p>Peak rate: 3,200 kWh x £0.28/kWh = £896<br>Off-peak rate: 3,200 kWh x £0.07/kWh = £224</p><p>Given that solar panels only produce during peak electricity rates, it would be reasonable to use the higher price here. A consideration for us though is that we do have batteries, and we're able to load-shift all of our usage into the off-peak rate, so arguably the solar panels only made £224 of electricity. </p><p>The bigger savings come when we start to look at the cost of the grid import. Assuming we had no solar panels, we'd have imported 17.3 MWh of electricity, and with the solar panels and perfect utilisation, we'd have imported 14.1 MWh of electricity. That's quite a lot of electricity and calculating the different costs of peak vs. off-peak by using batteries to load shift our usage gives some quite impressive results.</p><p>Peak rate: 17,300 kWh x £0.28/kWh = £4,844<br>Peak rate with solar: 14,100 kWh x £0.28 = £3,948</p><p>Off-peak rate: 17,300 kWh x £0.07/kWh = £1,211<br>Off-peak rate with solar: 14,100 kWh x £0.07/kWh = £987</p><p>This means there's a potential swing from £4,844 down to £987 with solar and battery, a total potential saving of £3,857!</p><p>This also tracks if we look at our monthly spend on electricity which went from £350-£400 per month down to £50-£100 per month depending on the time of year. But it gets better.</p><h4 id="exporting-excess-energy">Exporting excess energy</h4><p>Our solar array generates almost nothing in the winter months so our batteries are sized to allow for a full day of usage with basically no solar support. We can go from the start of the peak rate at 05:30 all the way to the off-peak rate at 23:30 without using any grid power. When it comes to the summer months, though, our solar array is producing a lot of power and we clearly have a capability to export a lot more. The batteries can fill up on the off-peak rate overnight at £0.07/kWh, and then export it during the peak rate for £0.15/kWh, meaning any excess solar production or battery capacity can be exported for a reasonable amount.</p><p>If we take a look at the billing information from our energy supplier, we can see that during July, our best month for solar production, we exported a lot of energy. We exported so much energy that it actually fully offset our electricity costs and allowed us to go negative, meaning we were earning money back.</p><p>Here is our electricity import data:</p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-7.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="988" height="623" srcset="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/image-7.png 600w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-7.png 988w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>And here is our electricity export data:</p><figure><img src="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-6.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="983" height="706" srcset="https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/image-6.png 600w, https://scotthelme.co.uk/content/images/2026/01/image-6.png 983w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>That's a pretty epic scenario, despite us being such high energy consumers, to still have the ability to full cover our costs and even earn something back! For clarity, we will still have the standing charge component of our bill, which is £0.45/day so about £13.50 per month to go on any given month, but looking at the raw energy costs, it's impressive.</p><h4 id="the-final-calculation">The final calculation</h4><p>I pulled all of our charges for electricity in 2025 to see just how close my calculations were and to double check everything I was thinking. Earlier, I gave these figures:</p><p>Off-peak rate: 17,300 kWh x £0.07/kWh = £1,211</p><p>If 100% of our electricity usage was at the off-peak rate, we should have paid £1,211 for the year. Adding up all of our monthly charges, our total for the year was £1,608.11 all in, but we need to subtract our standing charge from that.</p><p>Total cost = £1,608.11 - (365 * £0.45)<br><strong>Total import = £1,443.86</strong></p><p>This means that we got almost all of our usage at the off-peak rate which is an awesome achievement! After the charges for electricity, I then tallied up all of our payments for export.</p><p><strong>Total export = £886.49</strong></p><p>Another pretty impressive achievement, earning so much in export, which also helps to bring our net electricity cost in 2025 to <strong>£557.37</strong>! To put this another way, the effective rate of our electricity is now just £0.03/kWh.</p><p>£557.37 / 17,300kWh = <strong>£0.03/kWh</strong></p><h4 id="but-was-it-all-worth-it">But was it all worth it?</h4><p>That's a tricky question to answer, and everyone will have different objectives and desired outcomes, but ours was pretty clear. Running two Electric Vehicles, having two adults working from home full time, me having servers and equipment at home, along with a power hungry hot tub, we were spending too much per month in electricity alone, and our goal was to reduce that.</p><p>Of course, it only makes sense to spend money reducing our costs if we reduce them enough to pay back the investment in the long term, and things are looking good so far. Here are the costs for our installations:</p><p>£17,580 - Powerwalls #1 and #2 installed.<br>£13,940 - Solar array installed.<br>£7,840  - Powerwall #3 installed.<br>Total cost = £39,360</p><p>If we assume even a generous 2/3 - 1/3 split between peak and off-peak usage, with no Powerwalls or solar array, our electricity costs for 2025 would have been £3,632.86:</p><p>11,533 kWh x £0.28/kWh = £3,229.24<br>5,766 kWh x £0.07/kWh = £403.62<br>Total = £3,632.86</p><p>Instead, our costs were only £557.37, meaning we saved £3,078.49 this year. We also only had export capabilities for 7 months of 2025, so in 2026 when we will have 12 months of export capabilities, we should further reduce our costs. I anticipate that in 2026 our electricity costs for the year will be ~£0, and that's our goal.</p><p>Having our full costs returned in ~11 years is definitely something we're happy with, and we've also had protection against several power outages in our area along the way, which is a very nice bonus. Another way to look at this is that the investment is returning ~9%/year.</p><table>

<p>Of course, at some point during that period, the effective value of the installation will reduce to almost £0, and we have to consider that, but it's doing pretty darn good. If we hadn't needed to add that third Powerwall, this would have been so much better too. We'll see what the future holds, but with the inevitable and continued rise of energy costs, and talk of moving the standing charge on to our unit rate, things might look even better in the future.</p><h4 id="onwards-to-2026">Onwards to 2026!</h4><p>Now that we have everything properly set up, and I'm happy with all of our Home Assistant automations, we're going to see how 2026 goes. I will definitely circle back in a year from now and see how the numbers played out, and until then, I hope the information here has been useful or interesting 👍</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>What the scanners do</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Calculate archive priority scores (0-100) for each community</li>
<li>Track post counts, activity periods, deletion rates, NSFW content</li>
<li>Identify restricted, quarantined, or banned communities (highest priority)</li>
<li>Sort communities by archival importance</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Example output</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Reddit</strong>: 40,029 subreddits from 2.38B posts analyzed</li>
<li><strong>Voat</strong>: 15,545 subverses from 3.81M posts + 24.1M comments analyzed</li>
<li><strong>Ruqqus</strong>: 6,217 guilds from 500K posts analyzed</li>
<li><strong>Status breakdown</strong> (Reddit): 26,552 active, 8,642 restricted, 4,803 inactive, 32 quarantined</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Use cases</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Targeted archiving</strong>: Archive high-risk communities first (restricted, quarantined)</li>
<li><strong>Storage planning</strong>: Identify largest communities before downloading</li>
<li><strong>Historical research</strong>: Find communities with high deletion/removal rates</li>
</ul>

              <p>Hi all - I wanted to share here some exciting news we shared <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/12/anthropic-invests-in-python.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">on our blog</a> this morning: Anthropic has donated $1.5 million over two years to the PSF! Their landmark gift is focused on supporting our security work.</p>
<p>Here’s what we shared on social media:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big news: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/anthropicresearch/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Anthropic</a> is investing $1.5 million in the Python Software Foundation, focused on Python ecosystem security. This gift will make an enormous impact on the PSF and the safety and security of millions of Python and PyPI users.</p>
<p>Anthropic’s funds will enable the PSF to make progress on our security roadmap, including work designed to protect millions of PyPI users from attempted supply-chain attacks. Anthropic’s support will also go towards the PSF’s core work, including the Developer in Residence program driving contributions to CPython, community support through grants and other programs, running core infrastructure such as PyPI, and more.</p>
<p>We couldn’t be more grateful for Anthropic’s remarkable support, and we hope you will join us in thanking them for their landmark investment in the PSF and the Python community.</p>

        <div>Intuitive touch controls make it even easier to create desktop-class designs wherever users take their iPad. The full-featured Layers sidebar allows creators to build designs using a range of unique elements like images, shapes, text, and even video. Smart selection tools help users isolate and edit specific parts of images effortlessly, and with advanced bitmap and vector masks, users can hide or reveal discrete portions of their designs. The deep integration of hardware, software, and Apple silicon unlocks features like Super Resolution for intelligently upscaling photos, Deband for removing compression artifacts, and automatic composition suggestions with Auto Crop. With full support for Apple Pencil, digital artists can enjoy painting in the most natural way with a beautiful collection of pressure-sensitive brushes. And unmatched Apple Pencil precision — combined with features like hover,<sup>9</sup> squeeze,<sup>10</sup> and double-tap<sup>11</sup> — gives creators the ability to craft pixel-perfect designs.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We do this to our philosophies. We redraft their contours based on projected shadows, or give them a cartoonish shape like a caricaturist emphasising all the wrong features. This is how Buddhism becomes, in the popular imagination, a doctrine of passivity and even laziness, while Existentialism becomes synonymous with apathy and futile despair. Something similar has happened to Stoicism, which is considered – when considered at all – a philosophy of grim endurance, of carrying on rather than getting over, of tolerating rather than transcending life’s agonies and adversities.</p>
<p>No wonder it’s not more popular. No wonder the Stoic sage, in Western culture, has never obtained the popularity of the Zen master. Even though Stoicism is far more accessible, not only does it lack the exotic mystique of Eastern practice; it’s also regarded as a philosophy of merely breaking even while remaining determinedly impassive. What this attitude ignores is the promise proffered by Stoicism of lasting transcendence and imperturbable tranquility.</p>
<p>It ignores gratitude, too. This is part of the tranquility, because it’s what makes the tranquility possible. Stoicism is, as much as anything, a philosophy of gratitude – and a gratitude, moreover, rugged enough to endure anything. Philosophers who pine for supreme psychological liberation have often failed to realise that they belong to a confederacy that includes the Stoics. ‘According to nature you want to <em>live</em>?’ Friedrich Nietzsche taunts the Stoics in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> (1886):</p>
<blockquote>O you noble Stoics, what deceptive words these are! Imagine a being like nature, wasteful beyond measure, indifferent beyond measure, without purposes and consideration, without mercy and justice, fertile and desolate and uncertain at the same time; imagine indifference itself as a power – how <em>could </em>you live according to this indifference? Living – is that not precisely wanting to be other than this nature? Is not living – estimating, preferring, being unjust, being limited, wanting to be different? And supposing your imperative ‘live according to nature’ meant at bottom as much as ‘live according to life’ – how could you <em>not </em>do that? Why make a principle of what you yourself are and must be?</blockquote>
<p>This is pretty good, as denunciations of Stoicism go, seductive in its articulateness and energy, and therefore effective, however uninformed.</p>
<p>Which is why it’s so disheartening to see Nietzsche fly off the rails of sanity in the next two paragraphs, accusing the Stoics of trying to ‘impose’ their ‘morality… on nature’, of being ‘no longer able to see [nature] differently’ because of an ‘arrogant’ determination to ‘tyrannise’ nature as the Stoic has tyrannised himself. Then (in some of the least subtle psychological projection you’re ever likely to see, given what we know of Nietzsche’s mad drive for psychological supremacy), he accuses all of philosophy as being a ‘tyrannical drive’, ‘the most spiritual will to power’, to the ‘creation of the world’.</p>
<p>The truth is, indifference really <em>is</em> a power, selectively applied, and living in such a way is not only eminently possible, with a conscious adoption of certain attitudes, but facilitates a freer, more expansive, more adventurous mode of living. Joy and grief are still there, along with all the other emotions, but they are tempered – and, in their temperance, they are less tyrannical.</p>
<p><span>I</span>f we can’t always go to our philosophers for an understanding of Stoicism, then where <em>can </em>we go? One place to start is the<em> Urban Dictionary</em>. Check out what this crowdsourced online reference to slang gives as the definition of a ‘stoic’:</p>
<blockquote> <strong>stoic</strong><br>Someone who does not give a shit about the stupid things in this world that most people care so much about. Stoics do have emotions, but only for the things in this world that really matter. They are the most real people alive.<br><em>Group of kids are sitting on a porch. Stoic walks by.</em><br><em>Kid – ‘Hey man, yur a fuckin faggot an you suck cock!’</em><br><em>Stoic – ‘Good for you.’</em><br><em>Keeps going.</em> </blockquote>
<p>You’ve gotta love the way the author manages to make mention of a porch in there, because Stoicism has its root in the word <em>stoa</em>, which is the Greek name for what today we would call a porch. Actually, we’re more likely to call it a portico, but the ancient Stoics used it as a kind of porch, where they would hang out and talk about enlightenment and stuff. The Greek scholar Zeno is the founder, and the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius the most famous practitioner, while the Roman statesman Seneca is probably the most eloquent and entertaining. But the real hero of Stoicism, most Stoics agree, is the Greek philosopher Epictetus.</p>
<p>He’d been a slave, which gives his words a credibility that the other Stoics, for all the hardships they endured, can’t quite match. He spoke to his pupils, who later wrote down his words. These are the only words we know today as Epictetus’, consisting of two short works, the <em>Enchiridion </em>and the <em>Discourses</em>, along with some fragments. Among those whom Epictetus taught directly is Marcus Aurelius (another Stoic philosopher who did not necessarily expect to be read; his <em>Meditations </em>were written expressly for private benefit, as a kind of self-instruction).</p>
<p>Among those Epictetus has taught <em>indirectly</em> is a whole cast of the distinguished, in all fields of endeavour. One of these is the late US Navy Admiral James Stockdale. A prisoner of war in Vietnam for seven years during that conflict, he endured broken bones, starvation, solitary confinement, and all other manner of torture. His psychological companion through it all were the teachings of Epictetus, with which he had familiarised himself after graduating from college and joining the Navy, studying philosophy at Stanford University on the side. He kept those teachings close by in Vietnam, never letting them leave his mind even when things were at their most dire. Especially then. He knew what they were about, those lessons, and he came to know their application much better than anyone should have to.</p>
<p>Stockdale wrote a lot about Epictetus, in speeches and memoirs and essays, but if you want to travel light (and, really, what Stoic doesn’t?), the best thing you could take with you is a speech he gave at King’s College London in 1993, published as <em>Courage Under Fire: Testing Epictetus’s Doctrines in a Laboratory of Human Behavior</em> (1993). That subtitle is important. Epictetus once compared the philosopher’s lecture room to a hospital, from which the student should walk out in a little bit of pain. ‘If Epictetus’s lecture room was a hospital,’ Stockdale writes, ‘my prison was a laboratory – a laboratory of human behaviour. I chose to test his postulates against the demanding real-life challenges of my laboratory. And as you can tell, I think he passed with flying colours.’</p>
<p>‘You are unfortunate in my judgment, for you have never been unfortunate’</p>
<p>Stockdale rejected the false optimism proffered by Christianity, because he knew, from direct observation, that false hope is how you went insane in that prison. The Stoics themselves believed in gods, but ultimately those resistant to religious belief can take their Stoicism the way they take their Buddhism, even if they can’t buy into such concepts as karma or reincarnation. What the whole thing comes down to, distilled to its briefest essence, is making the choice that choice is really all we have, and that all else is not worth considering. ‘Who […] is the invincible human being?’ Epictetus once asked, before answering the question himself: ‘One who can be disconcerted by nothing that lies outside the sphere of choice.’</p>
<p>Any misfortune ‘that lies outside the sphere of choice’ should be considered an opportunity to strengthen our resolve, not an excuse to weaken it. This is one of the truly great mind-hacks ever devised, this willingness to convert adversity to opportunity, and it’s part of what Seneca was extolling when he wrote what he would say to one whose spirit has never been tempered or tested by hardship: ‘You are unfortunate in my judgment, for you have never been unfortunate. You have passed through life with no antagonist to face you; no one will know what you were capable of, not even you yourself.’ We do ourselves an immense favour when we consider adversity an opportunity to make this discovery – and, in the discovery, to enhance what we find there.</p>
<p>Another shrewdly resourceful Stoic mind-hack is what William B Irvine – in his book <em>A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy­</em> (2009)– has given the name ‘negative visualisation’. By keeping the very worst that can happen in our heads constantly, the Stoics tell us, we immunise ourselves from the dangers of too much so-called ‘positive thinking’, a product of the mind that believes a realistic accounting of the world can lead only to despair. Only by envisioning the bad can we truly appreciate the good; gratitude does not arrive when we take things for granted. It’s precisely this gratitude that leaves us content to cede control of what the world has already removed from our control anyway.</p>
<p>How did we let something so eminently understandable become so grotesquely misunderstood? How did we forget that that dark passage is really the portal to transcendence?</p>
<p><span>M</span>any will recognise in these principles the general shape and texture of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Indeed, Stoicism has been identified as a kind of proto-CBT. Albert Ellis, the US psychologist who founded an early form of CBT known as Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT) in 1955, had read the Stoics in his youth and used to prescribe to his patients Epictetus’s maxim that ‘People are disturbed not by things but by their view of things.’ ‘That’s actually the “cognitive model of emotion” in a nutshell,’ Donald Robertson tells me, and he should certainly know, as a therapist who in 2010 wrote a book on CBT with the subtitle ‘Stoic Philosophy as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy’.</p>
<p>This simplicity and accessibility ensure that Stoicism will never be properly embraced by those who prefer the abstracted and esoteric in their philosophies. In the novel <em>A Man in Full</em> (1998), Tom Wolfe gives Stoicism, with perfect plausibility, to a semi-literate prison inmate. This monologue of Conrad Hensley’s may be stilted, but there’s nothing at all suspect about the sentiment behind it. When asked if he is a Stoic, Conrad replies: ‘I’m just reading about it, but I wish there was somebody around today, somebody you could go to, the way students went to Epictetus. Today people think of Stoics – like, you know, like they’re people who grit their teeth and tolerate pain and suffering. What they are is, they’re serene and confident in the face of anything you can throw at them.’</p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius started each day telling himself: ‘I shall meet with meddling, ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, and unsociable people’</p>
<p>Which leads us naturally to ask just what it was that was thrown at them. We’ve already noted that Epictetus had the whole slavery thing going on, so he checks out. So does Seneca, in spite of what many have asserted – most recently the UK classicist Mary Beard in an essay for the <em>New York Review of Books</em> that asks: ‘How Stoical Was Seneca?’ before providing a none-too-approving answer. What Beard’s well-informed and otherwise cogent essay fails to allow for is just how tough it must have been for Seneca – tubercular, exiled, and under the control of a sadistically murderous dictator – no matter what access he sometimes had to life’s luxuries. It was Seneca himself who said that ‘no one has condemned wisdom to poverty’, and only an Ancient Greek Cynic would try to deny this. Besides, Seneca would have been the first to tell you, as he told a correspondent in one of his letters: ‘I am not so shameless as to undertake to cure my fellow-men when I am ill myself. I am, however, discussing with you troubles which concern us both, and sharing the remedy with you, just as if we were lying ill in the same hospital.’</p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius lay ill in that hospital, too. As beneficiary of the privileges of emperor, he also endured the struggles and stresses of that very same position, plus a few more besides. I know better than to try to improve on the following accounting, provided in Irvine’s <em>A Guide to the Good Life</em>:</p>
<blockquote>He was sick, possibly with an ulcer. His family life was a source of distress: his wife appears to have been unfaithful to him, and of the at least 14 children she bore him, only six survived. Added to this were the stresses that came with ruling an empire. During his reign, there were numerous frontier uprisings, and Marcus often went personally to oversee campaigns against upstart tribes. His own officials – most notably, Avidius Cassius, the governor of Syria – rebelled against him. His subordinates were insolent to him, which insolence he bore with ‘an unruffled temper’. Citizens told jokes at his expense and were not punished for doing so. During his reign, the empire also experienced plague, famine, and natural disasters such as the earthquake at Smyrna.</blockquote>
<p>Ever the strategist, Marcus employed a trusty technique in confronting the days that comprised such a life, making a point to tell himself at the start of each one of them: ‘I shall meet with meddling, ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, and unsociable people.’ He could have been different about it – he could have pretended things were just hunky-dory, especially on those days when they really were, or seemed to be. But how, then, would he have been prepared to angle both into the wind and away from it – adapting, always, to fate’s violently vexing vicissitudes? Where would that have left him when the weather changed?</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Democracy rarely collapses in a single dramatic moment. Lately, however, it can feel as though those type of moments are arriving faster and more frequently, piling up in ways that leave people disoriented and unsure where to look. What often gets lost in that rush is not concern, but orientation – a shared sense of where we are, what matters, and how any of it connects.





</p><p>Long before laws are tested or elections contested, something more basic starts to fray: the everyday understanding of how our communities work and who is accountable to whom.&nbsp;





</p><p>I’ve found myself asking a simple question more often lately: <em>Where do people actually see themselves inside public life anymore?</em>

</p>





<p>That question keeps leading me back to local journalism and to why its decline should concern anyone who cares about democracy.&nbsp;





</p><p>Democracy doesn’t live only in Washington or Harrisburg. It lives in school board meetings, zoning decisions, municipal budgets, local courts, and elections that rarely make national headlines. It lives where policy meets daily life. Local journalism is how those places stay visible.&nbsp;





</p>







<p>When local reporters attend meetings most of us can’t, sift through public records, and follow issues over time, they make public life legible. They help citizens see not just <em>what</em> happened, but <em>why</em> it matters, who made the decision, and what the consequences may be. Without that work, power doesn’t disappear – it simply operates out of view.&nbsp;





</p><p>National media plays an important role, but it works at a distance.&nbsp; Democracy, however, is practiced close to home. I’ve noticed that when local reporting weakens, people don’t just lose information – they lose orientation.&nbsp; It becomes harder to tell where influence actually lives, or how individual participation connects to outcomes.&nbsp;





</p><p>What often gets labeled as apathy looks different up close. Many people I speak with aren’t indifferent; they’re resigned. They’ve absorbed the sense that nothing they do matters, or that no one is really listening. When that happens, public life shrinks.&nbsp; Engagement gives way to spectatorship, and frustration seeks expression through outrage or grievance rather than responsibility.&nbsp;





</p><p>Local journalism quietly counters that drift by doing something deceptively simple: it keeps the public in the room.&nbsp;





</p><p><strong>INTERVIEW:</strong> <a href="https://buckscountybeacon.com/2025/01/interview-solidarity-journalism-can-help-the-mainstream-media-restore-public-trust-and-strengthen-democracy-with-dr-anita-varma/">Solidarity Journalism Can Help the Mainstream Media Restore Public Trust and Strengthen Democracy, with Dr. Anita Varma</a>





</p><p>It connects decisions to real people. It shows patterns rather than isolated moments. It reminds us that our communities are not abstract – that they are shaped by named individuals, concrete choices, and shared consequences. In that way, local journalism doesn’t just report on democracy; it helps sustain it.&nbsp;





</p><p>This is also why attacks on journalism, especially local journalism,&nbsp; feel so consequential. Undermining trust in reporters, starving newsrooms of resources, or dismissing local coverage as irrelevant all serve the same end: weakening the connective tissue that allows a community to hold itself accountable.&nbsp;





</p><p>At the same time, I don’t think the responsibility for preserving local journalism rests with journalists alone.&nbsp;





</p><p>Supporting local journalism isn’t charity. It’s civic participation.&nbsp;





</p>







<p>I’ve come to see local news outlets less as content providers and more as public infrastructure – as essential to democratic functioning as schools, courts, or roads. Subscribing, donating, and sharing credible reporting are practical ways citizens invest in the health of their communities.&nbsp;





</p><p>Engagement matters, too.&nbsp;Reading beyond headlines.&nbsp;Responding thoughtfully rather than reactively.&nbsp;&nbsp;Offering tips, context, and lived experience that strengthen reporting rather than distort it.&nbsp;&nbsp;





</p><p>These are small acts, but they shape the quality of the public conversation we’re all part of.&nbsp;





</p><p><strong>READ:</strong> <a href="https://buckscountybeacon.com/2025/11/democracy-begins-where-we-live/">Democracy Begins Where We Live</a>





</p><p>Publications like <em>Bucks County Beacon</em> model what this can look like: careful reporting, transparency about sources, and a commitment to clarity over sensationalism. In a media environment driven by speed and outrage, that kind of work feels both grounded and rare.&nbsp;





</p><p>I don’t see democracy as something we inherit once and for all. I see it as something we practice – in how we speak, what we support, and whether we stay engaged when the work feels slow or imperfect.&nbsp;





</p><p>At a moment when democratic norms feel increasingly fragile, local journalism offers something quietly powerful: a shared, grounded understanding of our common life. Defending it may be one of the most practical and hopeful&nbsp;choices citizens can make.&nbsp;

<h3>Algorithms, facial recognition, and tightening protest laws signal a deepening surveillance state</h3>



<p>~  <strong><em>Blade Runner</em></strong> ~</p>



<p>The UK is expanding its use of predictive policing and surveillance, framing it as a response to crime, protest, and public safety. But the direction is clear: more monitoring, earlier intervention, and more control over dissent.</p>



<p>In early April, <em>The Guardian </em>revealed that the Ministry of Justice is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/08/uk-creating-prediction-tool-to-identify-people-most-likely-to-kill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developing a “murder prevention” system</a>. The tool aims to identify individuals judged to be at high risk of committing lethal violence, based on data drawn from multiple agencies—social care, policing, education. The government has framed the project as a research initiative to improve risk assessments and early intervention. But its underlying logic marks a shift toward ‘precrime’—managing individuals on the basis of what they might do, rather than what they’ve done.</p>



<p>The comparison to <em>Minority Report</em>—Philip K. Dick’s 1956 story, later adapted into a 2002 film—is hard to avoid. In both, people are flagged not by witnesses or evidence, but by prediction systems that turn patterns into verdicts. Dick’s vision included ‘precogs’—human oracles housed by the state—while today’s version relies on datasets and AI algorithms. In both, the future is treated as knowable, and the present is shaped around managing that future in advance.</p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe title="Minority Report - Precrime Intro" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vrYKQiyeNv0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<p>Notably, overall crime rates in England and Wales have been falling for decades. According to the Office for National Statistics, <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingseptember2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incidents have dropped </a>from nearly 20 million in the mid-1990s to under 5 million in recent years. Homicide levels have followed a similar decline, with 594 recorded in the year ending March 2021—far below their peak in the early 2000s. Only 35 of those involved firearms. The relative rarity of such violence raises questions about why a predictive “murder prevention” system is being pursued now.</p>



<p>At the same time, police forces face <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/18/met-police-budget-heading-off-a-cliff-commissioner-mark-rowley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">severe financial pressure</a>. The Metropolitan Police is planning to cut 1,700 officers and staff to cover a £260 million budget gap. Other forces<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/31/policing-minister-police-forces-england-wales-challenging-cuts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> face similar cuts</a>. But rather than scaling back, policing is being reorganised—away from visible presence and toward data-driven surveillance, algorithmic profiling, and anticipatory enforcement.</p>



<p>The Crime and Policing Bill 2025 reinforces this direction. It allows police to access DVLA-held driver licence records for law enforcement purposes. While the Home Office denies any link to facial recognition, civil liberties groups have raised concerns that this access could be repurposed—effectively turning the DVLA database into a foundation for real-time identification. Combined with surveillance networks already active in shops, housing estates, and transport hubs, this lays the groundwork for a more integrated system of biometric tracking, with limited transparency or oversight. These tools are disproportionately deployed in working-class areas and are consistently shown to <a href="https://amnesty.ca/features/racial-bias-in-facial-recognition-algorithms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disproportionately </a> <a href="https://amnesty.ca/features/racial-bias-in-facial-recognition-algorithms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">misidentify Black and Brown individuals</a>.</p>



<p>In August 2024, following a series of racist attacks across England, Prime Minister Keir Starmer proposed the expanded use of live facial recognition technology (LFR) as part of the government’s response. Civil liberties groups, including Statewatch, <a href="https://www.statewatch.org/news/2024/august/uk-racist-violence-does-not-justify-proposed-expansion-of-police-surveillance-technology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">condemned the move</a>, warning that it would further entrench surveillance and racialised policing. In an open letter, over two dozen organisations <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/02/starmer-live-facial-recognition-plan-would-usher-in-national-id-campaigners-warn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued that the UK risks becoming “an outlier in the democratic world”</a> by embracing a technology with no explicit legal basis, widespread inaccuracy, and discriminatory impacts. Critics noted that the <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/uk/home-news/riots-far-right-facial-recognition-tech-b2595048.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">government’s response to racist violence</a> focused not on addressing its causes, but on expanding state power over already over-policed communities.</p>



<p>The focus of policing is also shifting. As street crime continues to fall, more attention is directed toward protest, dissent, and the perceived risk of unrest. UK military operations abroad—most recently <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2025/03/28/suspected-us-airstrikes-hit-houthi-controlled-areas-of-yemen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joint airstrikes in Yemen</a>—raise the likelihood of retaliatory attacks. Surveillance systems originally developed for counter-terrorism are now being used to monitor social movements and suppress political disruption.</p>



<p>Recent protest laws support this shift. The Public Order Act and related legislation criminalise slow marches, locking-on, and disruption to infrastructure. These laws were drafted in response to climate protests from groups such as Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion. Often operating without strong ties to other struggles—like labour, housing or anti-racist organising—these campaigns were easier to isolate and criminalise. The <a href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN05013/SN05013.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resulting legal framework</a> now stands ready for broader use.</p>



<p>The surveillance and predictive systems now being assembled are being designed not only for the current moment, but in preparation for what comes next. Whether in response to renewed austerity, military escalation, or widespread resistance, these tools are positioned to contain unrest before it surfaces. What’s emerging is a model of preemptive policing—structured around behaviour, association, and predicted risk. Individuals are reduced to data profiles, tracked not for what they’ve done but for their statistical proximity to disruption. Suppression is exercised in advance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Risk scoring, biometric surveillance, and protest restrictions are being embedded into law and infrastructure. These powers are built to be extended—to trade unionists, migrant organisers, housing activists, and anyone seen to disrupt the smooth functioning of a society of control.</p>

<p>The future of intelligence is being set right now, and the path we’re on leads somewhere I don’t want to go. We’re drifting toward a world where intelligence is something you rent — where your ability to reason, create, and decide flows through systems you don’t control, can’t inspect, and didn’t shape. In that world, the landlord can change the terms anytime, and you have no recourse but to accept what you’re given.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think we can do better. Making that happen is now central to what Mozilla is doing.</p>



<h2>What we did for the web</h2>



<p>Twenty-five years ago, Microsoft Internet Explorer controlled 95% of the browser market, which meant Microsoft controlled how most people experienced the internet and who could build what on what terms. Mozilla was born to change this, and Firefox succeeded beyond what most people thought possible — dropping Internet Explorer’s market share to 55% in just a few years and ushering in the Web 2.0 era. The result was a fundamentally different internet. It was faster and richer for everyday users, and for developers it was a launchpad for open standards and open source that decentralized control over the core technologies of the web.</p>



<p>There’s a reason the browser is called a “user agent.” It was designed to be on your side — blocking ads, protecting your privacy, giving you choices that the sites you visited never would have offered on their own. That was the first fight, and we held the line for the open web even as social networks and mobile platforms became walled gardens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now AI is becoming the new intermediary. It’s what I’ve started calling “Layer 8” — the agentic layer that mediates between you and everything else on the internet. These systems will negotiate on our behalf, filter our information, shape our recommendations, and increasingly determine how we interact with the entire digital world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The question we have to ask is straightforward: Whose side will your new user agent be on?</p>



<h2>Why closed systems are winning (for now)</h2>



<p>We need to be honest about the current state of play: Closed AI systems are winning today because they are genuinely easier to use. If you’re a developer with an idea you want to test, you can have a working prototype in minutes using a single API call to one of the major providers. GPUs, models, hosting, guardrails, monitoring, billing — it all comes bundled together in a package that just works. I understand the appeal firsthand, because I’ve made the same choice myself on late-night side projects when I just wanted the fastest path from an idea in my head to something I could actually play with.</p>



<p>The open-source AI ecosystem is a different story. It’s powerful and advancing rapidly, but it’s also deeply fragmented — models live in one repository, tooling in another, and the pieces you need for evaluation, orchestration, guardrails, memory, and data pipelines are scattered across dozens of independent projects with different assumptions and interfaces. Each component is improving at remarkable speed, but they rarely integrate smoothly out of the box, and assembling a production-ready stack requires expertise and time that most teams simply don’t have to spare. This is the core challenge we face, and it’s important to name it clearly: What we’re dealing with isn’t a values problem where developers are choosing convenience over principle. It’s a developer experience problem. And developer experience problems can be solved.</p>



<h2><strong>The ground is already shifting</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve watched this dynamic play out before and the history is instructive. In the early days of the personal computer, open systems were rough, inconsistent, and difficult to use, while closed platforms offered polish and simplicity that made them look inevitable. Openness won anyway — not because users cared about principles, but because open systems unlocked experimentation and scale that closed alternatives couldn’t match. The same pattern repeated on the web, where closed portals like AOL and CompuServe dominated the early landscape before open standards outpaced them through sheer flexibility and the compounding benefits of broad participation.</p>



<p>AI has the potential to follow the same path — but only if someone builds it.&nbsp; And several shifts are already reshaping the landscape:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Small models have gotten remarkably good</strong>. 1 to 8 billion parameters, tuned for specific tasks — and they run on hardware that organizations already own;</li>



<li><strong>The economics are changing too</strong>. As enterprises feel the constraints of closed dependencies, self-hosting is starting to look like sound business rather than ideological commitment (companies like Pinterest have attributed millions of dollars in savings to migrating to open-source AI infrastructure);</li>



<li><strong>Governments want control over their supply chain</strong>. Governments are becoming increasingly unwilling to depend on foreign platforms for capabilities they consider strategically important, driving demand for sovereign systems; and,</li>



<li><strong>Consumer expectations keep rising</strong>. People want AI that responds instantly, understands their context, and works across their tools without locking them into a single platform.</li>
</ul>



<p>The capability gap that once justified the dominance of closed systems is closing fast. What remains is a gap in usability and integration. The lesson I take from history is that openness doesn’t win by being more principled than the alternatives. Openness wins when it becomes the better deal — cheaper, more capable, and just as easy to use</p>



<h2><strong>Where the cracks are forming</strong></h2>



<p>If openness is going to win, it won’t happen everywhere at once. It will happen at specific tipping points  — places where the defaults haven’t yet hardened, where a well-timed push can change what becomes normal. We see four.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="522" src="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2026/01/image-1024x522.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2026/01/image-1024x522.png 1024w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2026/01/image-300x153.png 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2026/01/image-768x391.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2026/01/image-1536x782.png 1536w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2026/01/image-1000x509.png 1000w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2026/01/image.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p><strong>The first is developer experience.</strong> Developers are the ones who actually build the future  — every default they set, every stack they choose, every dependency they adopt shapes what becomes normal for everyone else. Right now, the fastest path runs through closed APIs, and that’s where most of the building is happening. But developers don’t want to be locked in any more than users do. Give them open tools that work as well as the closed ones, and they’ll build the open ecosystem themselves.</p>



<p><strong>The second is data.</strong> For a decade, the assumption has been that data is free to scrape  — that the web is a commons to be harvested without asking. That norm is breaking, and not a moment too soon. The people and communities who create valuable data deserve a say in how it’s used and a share in the value it creates. We’re moving toward a world of licensed, provenance-based, permissioned data. The infrastructure for that transition is still being built, which means there’s still a chance to build it right.</p>



<p><strong>The third is models.</strong> The dominant architecture today favors only the biggest labs, because only they can afford to train massive dense transformers. But the edges are accelerating: small models, mixtures of experts, domain-specific models, multilingual models. As these approaches mature, the ability to create and customize intelligence spreads to communities, companies, and countries that were previously locked out.</p>



<p><strong>The fourth is compute.</strong> This remains the choke point. Access to specialized hardware still determines who can train and deploy at scale. More doors need to open  — through distributed compute, federated approaches, sovereign clouds, idle GPUs finding productive use.</p>



<h2><strong>What an open stack could look like</strong></h2>



<p>Today’s dominant AI platforms are building vertically integrated stacks: closed applications on top of closed models trained on closed data, running on closed compute. Each layer reinforces the next  — data improves models, models improve applications, applications generate more data that only the platform can use. It’s a powerful flywheel. If it continues unchallenged, we arrive at an AI era equivalent to AOL, except far more centralized. You don’t build on the platform; you build inside it.</p>



<p>There’s another path. The sum of Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP won because that combination became easier to use than the proprietary alternatives, and because they let developers build things that no commercial platform would have prioritized. The web we have today exists because that stack existed.</p>



<p>We think AI can follow the same pattern. Not one stack controlled by any single party, but many stacks shaped by the communities, countries, and companies that use them:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Open developer interfaces at the top</strong>. SDKs, guardrails, workflows, and orchestration that don’t lock you into a single vendor;</li>



<li><strong>Open data standards underneath</strong>. Provenance, consent, and portability built in by default, so you know where your training data came from and who has rights to it;</li>



<li><strong>An open model ecosystem below that</strong>. Smaller, specialized, interchangeable models that you can inspect, tune to your values, and run where you need them; and&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Open compute infrastructure at the foundation</strong>. Distributed and federated hardware across cloud and edge, not routed through a handful of hyperscn/lallers.</li>
</ul>



<p>Pieces of this stack already exist — good ones, built by talented people. The task now is to fill in the gaps, connect what’s there, and make the whole thing as easy to use as the closed alternatives. That’s the work.</p>



<h2><strong>Why open source matters here</strong></h2>



<p>If you’ve followed Mozilla, you know <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">the Manifesto</a>. For almost 20 years, it’s guided what we build and how  — not as an abstract ideal, but as a tool for making principled decisions every single day. Three of its principles are especially urgent in the age of AI:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Human agency</strong>. In a world of AI agents, it’s more important than ever that technology lets people shape their own experiences — and protects privacy where it matters most;</li>



<li><strong>Decentralization and open source</strong>. An open, accessible internet depends on innovation and broad participation in how technology gets created and used. The success of open-source AI, built around transparent community practices, is critical to making this possible; and</li>



<li><strong>Balancing commercial and public benefit</strong>. The direction of AI is being set by commercial players. We need strong public-benefit players to create balance in the overall ecosystem.</li>
</ul>



<p>Open-source AI is how these principles become real. It’s what makes plurality possible  — many intelligences shaped by many communities, not one model to rule them all. It’s what makes sovereignty possible  — owning your infrastructure rather than renting it. And it’s what keeps the door open for public-benefit alternatives to exist alongside commercial ones.</p>



<h2><strong>What we’ll do in 2026</strong></h2>



<p>The window to shape these defaults is still open, but it won’t stay open forever. Here’s where we’re putting our effort  — not because we have all the answers, but because we think these are the places where openness can still reset the defaults before they harden.</p>



<p><strong>Make open AI easier than closed. </strong><a href="http://mozilla.ai/">Mozilla.ai </a>is building <a href="https://www.mozilla.ai/open-tools/choice-first-stack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any-s</a><a href="http://mozilla.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uite,</a> a modular framework that integrates the scattered components of the open AI stack — model routing, evaluation, guardrails, memory, orchestration  — into something coherent that developers can actually adopt without becoming infrastructure specialists. The goal is concrete: Getting started with open AI should feel as simple as making a single API call.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Shift the economics of data.</strong> The <a href="https://datacollective.mozillafoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mozilla Data Collective</a> is building a marketplace for data that is properly licensed, clearly sourced, and aligned with the values of the communities it comes from. It gives developers access to high-quality training data while ensuring that the people and institutions who contribute that data have real agency and share in the economic value it creates.</p>



<p><strong>Learn from real deployments.</strong> Strategy that isn’t grounded in practical experience is just speculation, so we’re deepening our engagement with governments and enterprises adopting sovereign, auditable AI systems. These engagements are the feedback loops that tell us where the stack breaks and where openness needs reinforcement.</p>



<p><strong>Invest in the ecosystem. </strong>We’re not just building; we’re backing others who are building too. Mozilla Ventures is investing in open-source AI companies that align with these principles. Mozilla Foundation is funding researchers and projects through targeted grants. We can’t do everything ourselves, and we shouldn’t try. The goal is to put resources behind the people and teams already doing the work.</p>



<p><strong>Show up for the community.</strong> The open-source AI ecosystem is vast, and it’s hard to know what’s working, what’s hype, and where the real momentum is building. We want to be useful here. We’re launching a newsletter to track what’s actually happening in open AI. We’re running meetups and hackathons to bring builders together. We’re fielding developer surveys to understand what people actually need. And at <a href="https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MozFest</a> this year, we’re adding a dedicated developer track focused on open-source AI. If you’re doing important work in this space, we want to help it find the people who need to see it.</p>



<h2><strong>Are you in?</strong></h2>



<p>Mozilla is one piece of a much larger movement, and we have no interest in trying to own or control it — we just want to help it succeed. There’s a growing community of people who believe the open internet is still worth defending and who are working to ensure that AI develops along a different path than the one the largest platforms have laid out. Not everyone in that community uses the same language or builds exactly the same things, but something like a shared purpose is emerging. Mozilla sees itself as part of that effort.</p>



<p>We kept the web open not by asking anyone’s permission, but by building something that worked better than the alternatives. We’re ready to do that again.</p>



<p>So: Are you in?</p>



<p>If you’re a developer building toward an open source AI future, we want to work with you. If you’re a researcher, investor, policymaker, or founder aligned with these goals, let’s talk. If you’re at a company that wants to build with us rather than against us, the door is open. Open alternatives have to exist — that keeps everyone honest.</p>



<p>The future of intelligence is being set now. The question is whether you’ll own it, or rent it.</p>

  The silence from the group of accounts, which began on Thursday, comes amid widespread protests against the leadership of the Islamic Republic.

  Industry publication <a href="https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/the-herald-launches-major-new-defence-in-scotland-series/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">UK Defence Journal</a>, which has tracked the accounts for months, <a href="https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/the-herald-launches-major-new-defence-in-scotland-series/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">said that</a> multiple X accounts claiming to be supporters of <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/topics/scottish-independence/?ref=au" target="_blank">Scottish independence</a> have ceased activity.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  One such account, known as ‘<a href="https://x.com/fiona175161" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fiona</a>’, has not posted since Thursday.

</p>
<p>
  The account, which describes itself as “a proud Scottish lass” and “passionate about Scotland's independence &amp; our right to self-determination”, is based in Europe (according to X’s location data).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  However, this is likely due to the use of a VPN which obscures the country or region the account is located in.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Other accounts, known as ‘<a href="https://x.com/jakeq9170/status/2009122928085160433" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jake</a>’ and ‘<a href="https://x.com/lucy9760" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lucy</a>’, have also been quiet since the blackout began.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  The accounts, which have thousands of followers, increasingly shared extreme content in the days prior to going dark.
</p>
<p>
  ‘Jake’ claimed that a “top BBC anchor resigned on air and was immediately detained by security services” and that “crowds have surrounded the residence of the newly appointed ‘Governor General’ imposed by London”.
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, ‘Fiona’ said that “protesters have seized Balmoral Estate” and “International markets are dumping UK assets as images of tanks in <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/local-news/edinburgh-news/?ref=au" target="_blank">Edinburgh</a> go viral”.
</p>

<p>
  ‘Lucy’ claimed that "farmers have used tractors to block the A1 at the English border”, while another account called ‘<a href="https://x.com/kelly18600" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kelly</a>’ said that “army trucks are rolling down the Royal Mile. Soldiers in fatigues are guarding the Scottish Parliament”.
</p>
<p>
  Previously, a group of pseudonymous accounts expressing support for Scottish independence went dark immediately after the internet in Iran collapsed amid Israeli and US strikes in June 2025.
</p>
<p>
  At the time, <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25413339.iranian-bots-behind-1-300-pro-independence-x-accounts/" target="_blank">disinformation analysis firm Cyabra claimed</a> that as much as “26% of profiles discussing Scottish independence were fake”.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We need to talk about war. And we need to talk about companies building bots that propose to rewrite our source code. And about the people behind both, and how we preserve what is great about FOSS while avoiding disruption. How do geopolitical conflicts on the one hand and the risk of bot-generated (adversarial) code on the other influence the global community working together on Free and Open Source software?</p>
<hr>
<p>The immense corpus of free and open source software created by a global community of researchers and engineers, developers, architects and designers is an impressive achievement of human collaboration at an unprecedented scale. An even bigger circle of users, translators, writers, creatives, civil society advocates, public servants and private sector stakeholders has helped to further develop and spread this technological Gesamtkunstwerk far and wide - with the help of the internet and the web. With individual freedoms and user empowerment at its center, these jointly created digital public goods have removed many economic and societal barriers for a large part of the world's population. Users are not just allowed to benefit from technology, but each and every user can in principle actively help shape it. On top of the FOSS ecosystem our global economy has been propelled to unprecedented levels.</p>
<p>Much of this incredible growth was achieved within a (relatively) calm geopolitical situation, in the wake of the cold war which ended in the very same year that also saw the genesis of the World Wide Web at CERN in Switzerland. Economists, philosophers and other observers at the time spoke of the 'end of history' and expected no more big conflicts at the superpower level. We could now globalise the economy and all work together. The flood of innovation taking place all around us promised a bright future for all, with room for altruism and collaboration. In retrospect it certainly was an ideal situation for an optimistic and constructive global movement like the FOSS community to take over the helm.</p>
<p>But apart from the fact that under the surface that narrative was already flawed (with some actors like the USA having a double agenda, as the Snowden and Shadowbrokers revelations exposed) history didn't end. To some ironic extent we are now becoming victim of our own success. In recent years we've seen geopolitical stability punctured by war effort levering low cost technology that includes heaps of FOSS. Social media powered by FOSS infrastructure promote disinformation and have successfully stirred large scale polarisation. Within some of the largest and most populous countries on the planet authoritarian regimes have successfully used technology to break oppression in a new race towards totalitarianism. While for instance Europe has tried to regulate 'dual use' technology, "any use" technology (which our libre licenses guarantee) has escaped our attention. Even in countries which had stable non-authoritarian regimes there is a visible technology-assisted relapse towards anti-democratic movements. On the back of a tech stack which consists of FOSS with a thin crust of proprietary special sauce, unprecedented private capital (sometimes referred to as 'hypercapitalism') is interfering with global politics at an alarming rate. Apart from the direct democratic disbalance the resulting oligarchy is giving rise to overt nepotism, corruption and a new global protectorate for predatory business models and unethical extractive behaviour. Expecting peace in cyberspace any time soon is probably naive, and free and open source technology stands to make up for a significant part of the battleground.</p>
<p>At the same time we are facing other challenges, such as climate change and an imminent scarcity of non-renewable resources. We have more people living on the surface of the planet than ever before, and they are consuming more raw materials and more energy than ever. This won't go on indefinitely. And right at that point we see an army of next generation Trojan horses galloping through the gates of our global commons villages, accelerating our use of both. Generative pre-trained transformers (also known as Large Language Models) kindly offer to take cumbersome and boring coding work off our hands. They can liberate us from responsibility and allow us to do other things or move even faster.</p>
<p>But is it really wise to accept this apparent gift, or should we be a little more suspicious? Just as it has proven way too easy for AI to poison the web with fake content, our software supply chain is vulnerable to manipulation. The attack surface is immense. Due to the inherent complexity of software it is easier to achieve and harder to detect manipulation before it is too late. While many talented and committed people have spent years reverse engineering binary blobs to avoid the associated risks, those blobs were at least isolated and clearly marked. AI is the ultimate black box and it introduces significantly more uncertainty: it rewrites the truth from the inside.</p>
<p>AI in its current form has no actual sense of truth or ethics. Like with Russian roulette, once in a while the models completely bork up and create phantom code and real risk - and that is even in a best case scenario, without assuming malicious intent and manipulation from the outside. In an adversarial scenario (and this adversity can come from traditional nation state actors with non-aligned interests but also from corporate or even private individuals with some determination - like Cambridge Analytica illustrated so vividly) manipulation only requires subtle changes. At the frantic scale at which any available learning content is ingested from the internet these days one can expect targeted adversarial training to manipulate specific code with subtle triggers to go unnoticed.</p>
<p>As a community we have spent billions of hours of careful coding and software engineering to make free and open source technology as trustworthy as it is today. Geopolitical conflict is an incentive to hollow out that trust. AI is an additional leap of faith, and if you look at the forces driving its adoption and their interests, are we really sure those black boxes are safe to invite into our trusted coding base? It is clear that the end game of AI coding is not a healthy FOSS ecosystem, but its total displacement. The threat of machine crafted and man-crafted malicious code in war-time FOSS are equally realistic. Perhaps we can find a middle ground, where we combine some of AI and human skill - and add enough checks and balances, and a variety of assurances through compartementalisation, formal and symbolical proofs and other traditional means of quality assurance.</p>
<p>This talk is an open exploration of some of the challenges the FOSS community will have in the years ahead, working towards a hopeful notion of maximal defendable FOSS.</p></div></div>]]></description>
