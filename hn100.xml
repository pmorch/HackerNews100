		<article>
         	<p>At the <a href="https://2025.pgconf.dev/">PGConf.dev 2025</a> Global Developer Conference, <a href="https://bohanzhang.me/#talks">Bohan Zhang</a> from OpenAI shared OpenAI’s best practices with PostgreSQL, offering a glimpse into the database usage of one of the most prominent unicorn companies.</p>
<blockquote>At OpenAI, we utilize an unsharded architecture with one writer and multiple readers, demonstrating that PostgreSQL can scale gracefully under massive read loads.<br>— PGConf.dev 2025, Bohan Zhang from OpenAI</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/introduction.png" alt="introduction.png"></p>
<p>Bohan Zhang is a member of OpenAI’s Infrastructure team. He studied under Professor <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/">Andy Pavlo</a> at Carnegie Mellon University and co-founded <a href="https://ottertune.com/">OtterTune</a> with him.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL serves as the core database supporting the majority of OpenAI’s critical systems. If PostgreSQL experiences downtime, many of OpenAI’s key services would be directly affected. There have been several instances in the past where issues related to PostgreSQL have led to outages of ChatGPT.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/background.png" alt="background.png"></p>
<p>OpenAI utilizes managed databases on Azure, employing a classic PostgreSQL primary-replica replication architecture without sharding. This setup consists of one primary database and over forty replicas. For a service like OpenAI, which boasts 500 million active users, scalability is a significant concern.</p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>In OpenAI’s primary-replica PostgreSQL architecture, read scalability is excellent. However, “write requests” have become a major bottleneck. OpenAI has implemented numerous optimizations in this area, such as offloading write loads wherever possible and avoiding the addition of new services to the primary database.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/challenges.png" alt="challenges.png"></p>
<p>PostgreSQL’s Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) design presents some known issues, including table and index bloat. Tuning automatic garbage collection (vacuuming) can be complex, as each write operation generates a complete new version, and index access may require additional visibility checks. These design aspects pose challenges when scaling read replicas: for example, increased Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) can lead to greater replication lag, and as the number of replicas grows significantly, network bandwidth may become a new bottleneck.</p>
<h3>Measures</h3>
<p>To address these issues, we have undertaken efforts on multiple fronts:</p>
<h4>Controlling Primary Database Load</h4>
<p>The first optimization involves smoothing out write spikes on the primary database to minimize its load. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offloading all possible write operations.</li>
<li>Avoiding unnecessary writes at the application level.</li>
<li>Using lazy writes to smooth out write bursts.</li>
<li>Controlling the frequency during data backfilling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, OpenAI strives to offload as many read requests as possible to replicas. For read requests that cannot be removed from the primary database due to being part of read-write transactions, high efficiency is required.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/control-loading.png" alt="control-loading.png"></p>
<h4>Query Optimization</h4>
<p>The second optimization focuses on the query layer. Since long transactions can hinder garbage collection and consume resources, timeouts are configured to avoid long “Idle in Transaction” sessions, with timeouts set at the session, statement, and client levels. Furthermore, complex multi-join queries (e.g., joining 12 tables at once) have been optimized. The presentation also specifically mentioned that using ORM can easily lead to inefficient queries and should be used cautiously.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/query_optimization.png" alt="query_optimization.png"></p>
<h4>Addressing Single Points of Failure</h4>
<p>The primary database is a single point of failure; if it goes down, write operations cannot proceed. In contrast, we have many read-only replicas; if one fails, applications can still read from others. In fact, many critical requests are read-only, so even if the primary database fails, they can continue to read from it.</p>
<p>Moreover, we differentiate between low-priority and high-priority requests. For high-priority requests, OpenAI allocates dedicated read-only replicas to prevent them from being affected by low-priority requests.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/single_point_failure.png" alt="single_point_failure.png"></p>
<h4>Schema Management</h4>
<p>The fourth measure is to only allow lightweight schema changes on this cluster. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating new tables or introducing new workloads is not permitted.</li>
<li>Adding or removing columns is allowed (with a 5-second timeout), but any operation requiring a full table rewrite is not allowed.</li>
<li>Creating or removing indexes is permitted but must use the CONCURRENTLY option.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another issue mentioned is that long-running queries (&gt;1s) during operation can continuously block schema changes, ultimately causing them to fail. The solution is to have the application optimize or offload these slow queries.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scaled Azure-hosted PostgreSQL to handle over one million QPS (combined read and write) across the entire cluster, supporting OpenAI’s critical services.</li>
<li>Added dozens of replicas (approximately 40) without increasing replication lag.</li>
<li>Deployed read-only replicas across different geographic regions while maintaining low latency.</li>
<li>Experienced only one PostgreSQL-related SEV0 incident in the past nine months.</li>
<li>Reserved ample capacity for future growth.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Incident Cases</h3>
<p>OpenAI also shared several case studies of issues encountered:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first case involved a cache failure leading to a cascading effect. <br><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/1st-incident.png" alt="1st-incident.png"></li>
<li>
<p>The second incident was particularly interesting: under extremely high CPU usage, a bug was triggered where, even after CPU levels normalized, the WALSender process continued spinning in a loop instead of properly sending WAL logs to replicas, resulting in increased replication lag.<br><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/2nd-incident.png" alt="2nd-incident.png"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Feature Requests</h3>
<p>Finally, Bohan presented several issues and feature requests to the PostgreSQL developer community:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Regarding index management: unused indexes can lead to write amplification and additional maintenance overhead. OpenAI wishes to remove unnecessary indexes but, to minimize risk, they propose a “Disable” feature for indexes. This would allow monitoring performance metrics to ensure stability before permanently dropping the index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On observability: currently, <code>pg_stat_statements</code> provides only average response times per query type, lacking direct access to p95 and p99 latency metrics. They hope for more metrics akin to histograms and percentile latencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concerning schema changes: they desire PostgreSQL to record a history of schema change events, such as adding or removing columns and other DDL operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring view semantics: they observed a session with <code>state = Active</code> and <code>wait_event = ClientRead</code> persisting for over two hours. This indicates a connection remained active for an extended period post-QueryStart, and such connections cannot be terminated by <code>idle_in_transaction</code> timeouts. They seek to understand if this is a bug and how to address it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly, they suggest optimizing PostgreSQL’s default parameters, noting that the current default values are overly conservative. They inquire whether better defaults or heuristic-based settings could be implemented.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Lao Feng’s Comments</h3>
<p>Although PGConf.Dev 2025 primarily focuses on development, there are often user-side use case shares as well—like OpenAI’s scalability practices with PostgreSQL. Topics like this are actually quite interesting to core developers, since many of them have no concept of how PostgreSQL is used in extreme real-world scenarios.</p>
<p>Since the end of 2017, Lao Feng managed dozens of PostgreSQL clusters at Tantan, which was one of the largest and most complex deployments in China’s internet sector at the time: dozens of PostgreSQL clusters handling around 2.5 million QPS. Back then, their largest core cluster used a master with 33 replicas and carried around 400,000 QPS. The bottleneck was also on single-node write performance, which they eventually addressed through database and table sharding on the application side.</p>
<p>You could say that the issues encountered and the solutions applied in OpenAI’s talk were all things they’ve dealt with before. Of course, what’s different now is that today’s top-tier hardware is way more powerful than it was eight years ago. That allows a startup like OpenAI to use a single PostgreSQL cluster—without sharding or partitioning—to serve their entire business. This undoubtedly serves as another strong piece of evidence for the idea that “distributed databases are a false need.”</p>
<p>OpenAI uses managed PostgreSQL on Azure, with top-tier server specs. The number of replicas reaches over 40, including some cross-region replicas. This massive cluster handles around 1 million QPS (read + write) in total. They use Datadog for monitoring, and their services access the RDS cluster through application-side PgBouncer connection pooling from within Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Since OpenAI is a strategic-level customer, the Azure PostgreSQL team provides very hands-on support. But clearly, even with top-tier cloud database services, users still need strong awareness and capabilities on the application and operations side. Even with the brainpower of OpenAI, they still run into pitfalls in PostgreSQL operations in practice.</p>
<p>High availability wasn’t discussed in this talk, so we can assume that’s handled by Azure PostgreSQL RDS. Meanwhile, monitoring is critical for system ops. OpenAI uses Datadog to monitor PostgreSQL—and even with OpenAI’s financial resources, they still feel that Datadog is ridiculously expensive.</p>
<p>After the conference, during the evening social event, Lao Feng had a long chat into the early hours with Bohan and two other database founders. The private conversation was very engaging, though Lao Feng couldn’t reveal more details—haha.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/social.png" alt="social.png"></p>
<h3>Lao Feng Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>Regarding the issues and feature requests raised by Bohan, Lao Feng offers some answers here. In fact, most of the functionality OpenAI is looking for already exists within the PostgreSQL ecosystem—it just might not be available in the core PostgreSQL or on Azure RDS.</p>
<h4>On Disabling Indexes</h4>
<p>PostgreSQL actually does have a feature to disable indexes. You can simply set the indisvalid field to false in the pg_index system catalog. This makes the planner ignore the index, although it will still be maintained during DML operations. From a technical standpoint, this is totally fine—this is the same mechanism used during concurrent index creation via the isready and isvalid flags. It’s not black magic.</p>
<p>That said, it’s understandable why OpenAI can’t use this method—RDS doesn’t grant superuser permissions, so you can’t modify system catalogs directly to achieve this.</p>
<p>But going back to the original goal—avoiding accidental deletion of indexes—there’s a simpler solution: just confirm via monitoring views that the index is not being used on either primary or replicas. If it hasn’t been accessed for a long time, it’s safe to delete.</p>
<p>Using the Pigsty monitoring system, you can observe the process of live index switching for PGSQL tables.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/monitoring.png" alt="monitoring.png"></p>
<pre><code>CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY pgbench_accounts_pkey2
ON pgbench_accounts USING BTREE(aid);

-- Mark the original index as invalid (won’t be used) but still maintained
UPDATE pg_index SET indisvalid = false
WHERE indexrelid = 'pgbench_accounts_pkey'::regclass;</code></pre>
<h4>On Observability</h4>
<p>pg_stat_statements likely won’t provide P95 or P99 percentile metrics anytime soon, as this would drastically increase the memory footprint of the extension—maybe dozens of times. While modern servers could handle it, extremely conservative environments might not. I asked the maintainer of pg_stat_statements about this and it’s unlikely to happen. I also asked Jelte, the maintainer of pgbouncer, and such functionality is also unlikely in the short term.</p>
<p>But the issue can be addressed. First, the pg_stat_monitor extension does provide detailed percentile latency (RT) metrics and would certainly work, though you’ll need to consider the performance overhead of collecting such metrics. A second option is using eBPF to passively collect RT metrics, and of course, the simplest way is to add query latency monitoring directly in the application’s data access layer (DAL).</p>
<p>The most elegant solution might be eBPF-based side-channel collection, but since they’re using Azure’s managed PostgreSQL without server access, this option is probably off the table.</p>
<h4>On Schema Change History</h4>
<p>Actually, PostgreSQL logs already offer this capability—just set log_statement to ddl (or more verbosely, mod or all), and all DDL statements will be logged. The pgaudit extension provides similar capabilities.</p>
<p>But I suspect what they really want is not logs, but a system view that can be queried via SQL. In that case, another option is to use CREATE EVENT TRIGGER to log DDL events directly into a data table. The pg_ddl_historization extension provides a much easier way to do this, and I’ve already compiled and packaged this extension.</p>
<p>However, creating event triggers also requires superuser privileges. AWS RDS has some special handling that makes this possible, but Azure’s PostgreSQL doesn’t seem to support it.</p>
<h4>On the Semantics of Monitoring Views</h4>
<p>In OpenAI’s example, State = Active means the backend process is still within the lifecycle of a single SQL statement—it hasn’t sent a ReadyForQuery message to the frontend yet, so PostgreSQL still considers the statement “not yet finished.” As a result, resources like row locks, buffer pins, snapshots, and file handles are still considered “in use.” WaitEvent = ClientRead means the process is waiting for input from the client. When both appear together, a typical case is an idle COPY FROM STDIN, but it could also be due to TCP blocking or being stuck between BIND and EXECUTE. So it’s hard to say definitively whether it’s a bug—it depends on what the connection is actually doing.</p>
<p>Some might argue that waiting for client I/O should count as “idle” from a CPU perspective. But State tracks the execution state of the statement, not whether the process is actively using the CPU. A query can be in the Active state while not running on CPU (when WaitEvent is NULL), or it can be looping on CPU waiting for client input (i.e., ClientRead).</p>
<p>Back to the core issue—there are ways to address it. For example, in Pigsty, when PostgreSQL is accessed via HAProxy, the primary service has a maximum connection lifespan (e.g., 24 hours) set at the load balancer level. In more stringent environments, this can be as short as one hour. This means connections exceeding the lifespan are terminated. Ideally, though, the client-side connection pool should proactively enforce connection lifetimes instead of being forcibly disconnected. For offline, read-only services, this timeout isn’t needed—allowing for long-running queries that may last for days. This approach provides a safety net for cases where a connection is Active but waiting on I/O.</p>
<p>That said, it’s unclear whether Azure PostgreSQL offers this kind of control.</p>
<h4>On Default Parameters</h4>
<p>PostgreSQL’s default parameters are extremely conservative. For example, it defaults to just 256 MB of memory (and can be set as low as 256 KB!). The upside is that PostgreSQL can start and run in virtually any environment. The downside? I’ve seen a production setup with 1 TB of physical memory still running with the default 256 MB configuration… (Thanks to double buffering, it actually ran for quite a while.)</p>
<p>Overall, I think conservative defaults aren’t a bad thing. This issue can be solved with more flexible dynamic configuration. Services like RDS and Pigsty offer well-designed heuristics for initial parameter tuning, which already solves this problem quite well. That said, this feature could still be built into PostgreSQL command-line tools—e.g., during initdb, the tool could auto-detect CPU, memory, disk size and type, and set sensible defaults accordingly.</p>
<h4>Self-Hosting?</h4>
<p>The real challenges in OpenAI’s setup don’t stem from PostgreSQL itself, but rather the limitations of using managed PostgreSQL on Azure. One solution would be to bypass those restrictions by using Azure or another cloud’s IaaS layer to deploy self-hosted PostgreSQL clusters on local NVMe SSD instances.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://pigsty.io/">Pigsty</a> was built by Lao Feng specifically to address PostgreSQL challenges at this scale—it’s essentially a self-hosted RDS solution, and it scales well. Many of the problems OpenAI has encountered—or will encounter—already have solutions implemented in Pigsty, which is open-source and free.</p>
<p>If OpenAI is interested, I’d be happy to offer some help. That said, when a company is scaling as fast as they are, tweaking database infrastructure might not be a top priority. Fortunately, they’ve got some excellent PostgreSQL DBAs who can keep pushing forward and exploring these paths.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        
<h3 id="chapter-1-my-coworker-the-programmer">Chapter 1: My Coworker, The Programmer</h3>
<p>A shell of a man—more of a parrot than a person. My boss, a true believer in the sacred rite of Pair Programming, chained myself and this "programmer"-colleague together like conjoined twins from different planets. We shared a keyboard, but not a brain. Lord, not even close.</p>
<p>"Hold up. I’ve got an idea. Gimme the keyboard real quick."</p>
<p>An idea. Yes. The same way a toddler has “an idea” to stick a fork in a wall socket. I was halfway through constructing something beautiful—a lean, elegant piece of logic that sliced through complexity like a blade through butter—and here he comes, pounding the keyboard like it owes him money, pasting in code he <em>Frankensteined</em> from a stack overflow comment written by an Uncle Bob disciple in 2014.</p>
<p>Did he know what our system did? No.<br>Did he read the ticket? <em>Absolutely fucking not</em>.<br>Did he feel confident mutating global state with reckless abandon? <em>He absolutely fucking did</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m doing some refactoring. Tightening the bolts, cleaning up component trees, re-aligning the chakras of the system.</p>
<p>Suddenly:<br>"Hey, I added a <code>useEffect</code> that refetches everything when <em>anything</em> changes. Cool, right?"</p>
<p>"Why?" I ask, blinking like a hostage on a tape sent home from a military operation gone wrong.</p>
<p>"It fixed the thing," he says. "Where the thing wasn’t working. It's a working thing now."</p>
<p>A chaos monkey disguised as a teammate. No tests. No profiling. No understanding of side effects or performance impact. Just blind clicking and tapping and typing. The programming equivalent of punching your TV to make the static stop.</p>
<p>And he did this with <em>everyone</em>. A one-man bug factory. Whispering half-formed solutions into the ears of juniors like a sick, twisted full-stack Rasputin. Apparently, friendly fire will be tolerated.</p>
<hr>
<p>The system explodes. Nothing deploys. The UI is frozen like the vegetables in my freezer I was supposed to defrost 8 years ago. And where is my dear co-pilot?</p>
<p>Nowhere.</p>
<p>He’s vanished—probably reading about a shiny new JS framework he’ll try to shove down my throat next week. Meanwhile, I’m left spelunking through callback hell with a flashlight made of regret.</p>
<p>My boss corners me.<br>"Why aren’t you pairing more with him? He types <em>twice</em> as fast as you."</p>
<p>Of course he does. So does a cat having a seizure on a mechanical keyboard. But that doesn’t mean it should be writing production code.</p>
<hr>
<p>I kept pushing myself—learning infrastructure, refining my mental models, sweating over trade-offs. And him? He googled. He skimmed. He pasted. Occasionally he’d show off a clever trick—half-correct, contextless—and the team would ooh and aah like cavemen discovering fire.</p>
<p>And I got lazy. Of course I did. When the system forces you to code with a hallucinating clown, eventually you stop resisting. You let him type. You let him be "productive." You check out. You surrender your brain to the noise and just float.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Captain Obvious is here to Save the Day.</strong><br>I wasn’t talking about a programmer. I was describing GitHub Copilot. Or Claude Codex. Or OpenAI lmnop6.5 ultra watermelon.</p>
<p>This isn’t about tools or productivity or acceleration. It’s about the <em>illusion</em> of progress. Because if that programmer—if that <em>thing, that CREATURE</em>—walked into your stand-up in human form, typing half-correct garbage into your codebase while ignoring your architecture and disappearing during cleanup, you’d fire them before they could say "no blockers".</p>
<p>But slap Microsoft's marketing label on it and plug it into the IDE of every developer in the org? Now <em>that’s innovation. Science. Progress. Profit.</em></p>
<p>A real copilot, on a commercial airline? They know the plane. The systems. They’ve done the simulations. They go through recertification. When they speak, it’s to <em>enhance</em> the pilot—not to shotgun random advice into the cockpit and eject themselves mid-flight.</p>
<p>Copilot isn’t that. It’s just the ghost of a thousand blog posts and cocky stack-overflow posts whispering, "<em>Hey, I saw this once. With my eyes. Which means it's good code. Let’s deploy it."</em> Then vanishing when the app hits production and the landing gear won’t come down.</p>
<p>If you let that ghost fly the plane, you deserve the ball of flames you go up in.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-2-the-props">Chapter 2: The Props</h3>
<p>Let’s get one thing straight before I resume torching this synthoid hellspawn with the fury of the sun: <strong>it ain’t all bad</strong>.</p>
<p>Even the grifter at the poker table with a booze lobotomy occasionally hits a flush. And Copilot? Well, sometimes it knows a thing or two.</p>
<p>You’re young. You’ve never touched C++. You’re staring at the syntax like it’s some Martian cave painting. You ask the oracle for help and boom—there it is. Templates, smart pointers, range-based for-loops—syntactically pristine, like it slithered straight out of Bjarne’s brain and onto your screen.</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn’t know the edge cases. It won’t whisper, "Hey—<code>shared_ptr</code> might leak if you get clever and toss raw pointers into the mix like a maniac." It doesn’t point you to the holy scrolls where veterans debate exception guarantees like theologians dissecting scripture. But if you already know what you want and just need the incantation, it’s a better, quicker scribe than most human interns—and it doesn’t complain when you ask it to write template metaprogramming code at 3 a.m.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now let’s say you’re doing <em>real programming work</em>—system design. Big-boy decisions. Infrastructure. The kind of thing that requires a spine and an encyclopedic knowledge of the ByteByteGo YouTube channel. You lay out your plan like a general before a war: here’s the ingress, here’s the queue, here’s the cache invalidation policy that might just kill us all.</p>
<p>Then you ask Copilot, "Hey, what’s going to break?"</p>
<p>Suddenly, it’s rattling off weaknesses like a security auditor. Maybe half of them are dumb. Maybe some are duplicated. But it dumped the brainstorm faster than your junior ever could, and now you’ve got the ammo to write a spec that makes you look like you crank your hog with Martin Kleppmann himself.</p>
<hr>
<p>Sometimes you’re just tired. Not mentally dead, but running low—your brain’s in "turning-object-into-a-string" mode. You don’t <em>need</em> help. You just don’t want to rotate the matrix in your skull like you’re solving a Rubik’s Cube made of jelly.</p>
<p>So you say, "Hey, I’ve got this C# object and I want a LINQ query that groups it by field X, sums Y, and filters Z."</p>
<p>Copilot answers like a weird little gremlin slave creature with a clipboard: <em>"Done, boss."</em></p>
<p>You don’t trust it. You check it line by line. But still—you didn’t have to juggle twenty method chains in your head, and that buys you time to think about actual problems.</p>

<p>Maybe you’re reading some dense mathematical whitepaper, the kind written by deranged mathematicians with PhDs and no regard for human sanity. You don’t have the energy to transmute this LaTeX-laden elder scroll into code. Copilot takes a swing and gives you a half-baked pseudocode scaffold. Garbage? Maybe. But garbage you can build on. You handle the performance tuning, the SIMD, the low-level grit. It just gave you the scaffolding to stack explosives on.</p>
<hr>
<p>Maybe you inherited someone else’s codebase. A minefield of nested closures, half-commented hacks, and variable names like <code>d</code> and <code>foo</code>. A mess of complex OOPisms, where you have to traverse 18 files just to follow a single behaviour. You don’t have all day. You need a flyover—an aerial view of the warzone before you land and start disarming traps.</p>
<p>Ask Copilot: "<em>What’s this code doing?"</em><br>It won’t be poetry. It won’t necessarily provide a full picture. But it’ll be <em>close enough</em> to orient yourself before diving into the guts.</p>
<hr>
<p>So—props where props are due<strong>.</strong> Copilot is like a greasy, high-functioning but practically poor intern:</p>
<ul><li>Great with syntax memory.</li><li>Surprisingly quick at listing out your blind spots.</li><li>Good at building scaffolding if you feed it the exact right words.</li><li>Horrible at nuance.</li><li>Useless without supervision.</li><li>Will absolutely kill you in production if left alone for 30 seconds.</li></ul>
<p>Now, let’s go back to setting it on fire.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-3-you-as-a-programmer">Chapter 3: You as a Programmer</h3>
<div><p>First things first: I like to code. Not supervise. Not hover over a synthetic lobotomized chatbot like some drooling silicon intern trying to remember what <code>std::move</code> actually <em>does</em>. I don’t want to be the meatbag middle-manager reviewing some neural net’s fever dream of a <code>switch</code> statement. I want to build shit. Real shit. Weird shit. Systems that are *on fire* type shit.</p><p>"But I just use AI for boilerplate!" you whimper, clutching your Co-Pilot subscription. Listen to yourself. If you’re writing the same boilerplate every day like some industrial-age cog monkey, automate it <em>yourself</em>. Write a library. Invent a macro. Reclaim some dignity. If AI’s doing your "boring parts", what exactly is <em>left</em> for you to do? Fidget with sliders? Paint by numbers while the inference works it's magic?</p></div>
<p>And let’s not ignore the FOMO goblins. I see you. Pounding Monster energy at 2 A.M., telling yourself you’re "building the future" while you slap together some Frankenstein CRUD app with a bot spoon-feeding you syntax it scraped from 2016 GitHub. It's buggy. It's ugly. You didn't even give it a once over before you posted that video to Twitter. "I’m just moving fast!" you say. Yeah—straight off a cliff, like a lemming. AI isn’t helping you build something novel. It can’t. It only knows what’s been done before. It’s autocomplete with a superiority complex.</p>
<p>You want real connection to code? You <em>earn</em> that. You dig in. You wrestle with segfaults at 3 in the morning. You pace your apartment muttering about pointer arithmetic. You burn through Handmade Hero until you <em>get it</em>. You write your own damn notes instead of snapping lecture slides and pretending it counts. When you outsource the thinking, you outsource the learning. You become a conduit for a mechanical bird regurgitating it's hunt directly into your baby-bird mouth. You don’t <em>know</em> your code. You’re babysitting it.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about the quality of your code, too—because it ain’t getting better. Most engineers already write bloated, abstracted, glacial code that burns CPU cycles like a California wildfire. Clean code? Ha! You’re writing for <em>other programmers’</em> academic circlejerk, not the hardware. You’ve forgotten that the machine matters. AI has no concept of memory locality. No intuition for cache misses. It won’t unroll a loop or spot the false sharing in your atomic struct. It’s trained on code that’s already an insult to silicon.</p>
<p>The problem isn’t just laziness. It’s <em>degradation</em>. Engineers stop exploring. Stop improving. Stop <em>caring</em>. One more layer of abstraction. One more lazy fetch call inside a render loop. Eventually, you’re living in a cathedral of technical debt, and every user pays—milliseconds at a time, each click a tax on your apathy.</p>
<p>And the "copilot" branding. A real copilot? That’s a peer. That’s a certified operator who can fly the bird if you pass out from bad taco bell. They train. They practice. They review checklists <em>with you</em>. GitHub Copilot is more like some guy who played Arma 3 for 200 hours and thinks he can land a 747. He read the manual once. In Mandarin. Backwards. And now he’s shouting over your shoulder, "Let me code that bit real quick, I saw it in a Slashdot comment!"</p>
<p>At that point, you’re not working with a copilot. You’re playing Russian roulette with a loaded dependency graph.</p>
<p>You want to be a real programmer? Use your head. Respect the machine. Or get out of the cockpit.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-4-the-computer-as-a-machine"><br>Chapter 4: The Computer as a Machine</h3>

<p>Listen. You’re human. Soft flesh, rotting teeth, synapses pissing electrical signals at each other motivated by caffeine and spite. But <em>you</em>—at your most frazzled, sleep-deprived, raccoon-eyed best—you can <em>try</em>. You can squint at the layers of abstraction and <em>see through them</em>. Peel back the nice ergonomic type-safe, pure, lazy, immutable syntactic sugar and imagine the mess of assembly the compiler pukes up. You can <em>feel</em> the cache lines like a sixth sense. You know where the data wants to be. And where the silicon gets angry when you screw that up.</p>
<p>The machine is real. The silicon is real. The DRAM, the L1, the false sharing, the branch predictor flipping a coin—it’s all real. And if you care, you <em>can</em> work with it. You can make your programs slither through memory like a steel serpent with little to no overhead. You can tee up prefetches with finesse. You can hand-roll an allocation strategy that makes malloc look like child's play. You can know—actually <em>know</em>—when it’s time to crack your knuckles and write a few lines of filthy, yet beautiful inline assembly to directly inject steroids into your program's shiny cheeks.</p>
<p>But the bot? The <em>bot</em>? The bot has no clue.</p>
<p>The bot has <em>zero</em> understanding. It can’t tell a page fault from a paper cut. It’ll hallucinate a memory model like I hallucinate after 2 days of no sleep. It can’t profile. It can’t understand a flamegraph. It can’t feel the cold burn of wasted CPU cycles on a hot loop. It’ll copy the advice of a sweaty stranger from an ‘08 StackOverflow thread who was benchmarking on a Pentium 4 with 512MB of RAM and a dream. It will say, "This is optimal", like it knows anything. Like it’s <em>seen</em> a cache miss. It hasn’t. You have.</p>
<p>The thing will feed you trash. It’ll feed you fake wisdom from fake people and beg you to trust it. But if you want to make a fast, beautiful system—if you want to sculpt the kind of software that gets embedded in pacemakers and missile guidance systems and M1 tanks—you better throw that bot out the airlock and <em>learn</em>.</p>
<p>You build taste by <em>doing</em>. By hurting. By shaving nanoseconds with surgical tools. By writing a routine on Monday, rewriting it Tuesday, and realizing Wednesday it still sucks. You don’t build taste by asking the MS Clippy of 2025 how to do your job.</p>
<p>We are, in the long arc of computing history, still covered in dirt, yanking our bits around with ploughs. We ride <em>horses</em>. But some of us—the ones with blown-out eyeballs and scorched keyboards—some of us know how to build the next thing. Trains. Speedboats. Hypersonic jets of pure code.</p>
<p>And the ones who keep using AI like it’s a divine oracle? They’ll be out there trying to duct-tape horses to an engine block, wondering why it doesn’t fly. Saying, "Hey. It's still not flying. ... ... ... Still not flying. ... ... ... Still doesn't fly fix it please.".</p>
<h3 id="chapter-5-conclusion"><br>Chapter 5: Conclusion</h3>
<p><br>The thing I hate the most about AI and it's ease of access; the slow, painful death of the hacker soul—brought not by war or scarcity, but by convenience. By <em>buttons</em>. By bots.</p>
<p>The real horror isn’t that AI will take our jobs—it’s that it will <em>let</em> people in who never wanted the job to begin with. Vampires with SaaS dreams and Web3 in their LinkedIn bio. Empty husks who see the terminal not as a frontier, but as a shovel for digging up VC money. They’ll drool over their GitHub Copilot like it’s the holy spirit of productivity, pumping out React CRUD like it’s oxygen. They'll fork VS Code yet again, just to sell the same dream to a similarly deluded kid.</p>
<p>There was once magic here. There was once <em>madness</em>.</p>
<p>Kids would stay up all night on IRC with bloodshot eyes, trying to render a cube in OpenGL without segfaulting their future. They <em>cared</em>. They would install Gentoo on a toaster just to see if it’d boot. They knew the smell of burnt voltage regulators and the <em>exact</em> line of assembly where Doom hit 10 FPS on their calculator. These were *artists*. They wrote code like jazz musicians—full of rage, precision, and divine chaos.</p>
<p>Now? We’re building a world where that curiosity gets lobotomized at the door. Some poor bastard—born to be great—is going to get told to "review this AI-generated patchset" for eight hours a day, until all that wonder calcifies into apathy. The terminal will become a spreadsheet. The debugger a coffin.</p>
<p>Because <em>you don’t know what you don’t know</em>. That’s the cruel joke. We’ll fill this industry with people who <em>think</em> they’re good, because their bot passed CI. They'll float through, confident, while the real ones—the hungry ones—get chewed up by a system that doesn’t value understanding anymore. Just output. Just tokens per second.</p>
<p>And what’s worse, we’ll normalize this mediocrity. Cement it in tooling. Turn it into a best practice. We'll enshrine this current bloated, sluggish, over-abstracted hellscape as the <em>pinnacle</em> of software—and the idea of squeezing every last drop of performance out of a system, or building something lean and wild and precise, will sound like <em>folklore</em>.</p>
<p>If that happens? If the last real programmers are drowned in a sea of button-clicking career-chasers—then I pity the smart outsider kids to come after me.</p>
<p>Defer your thinking to the bot, and we all rot.</p>

<p>At the <a href="https://linuxappsummit.org/">Linux Application
Summit</a> (LAS) in April, Sebastian Wick said that, by many metrics, <a href="https://flatpak.org/">Flatpak</a> is doing great. The Flatpak
application-packaging format is popular with upstream developers, and
with many users. More and more applications are being published in the
<a href="https://flathub.org/">Flathub</a> application store, and the
format is even being adopted by Linux distributions like
Fedora. However, he worried that work on the Flatpak project itself
had stagnated, and that there were too few developers able to review
and merge code beyond basic maintenance.</p>

<p>I was not able to attend LAS in person or watch it live-streamed,
so I watched the YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HkYJ7M119I">video</a> of the
talk. The slides are available from the <a href="https://conf.linuxappsummit.org/event/7/contributions/219/">talk
page</a>. Wick is a member of the GNOME Project and a Red Hat employee
who works on "<q>all kinds of desktop plumbing</q>", including Flatpak
and <a href="https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/">desktop
portals</a>.</p>

<h4>Flatpak basics</h4>

<p>Flatpak was <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/wiki/Flatpak%27s-History">originally
developed</a> by Alexander Larsson, who had been working on similar
projects stretching back to 2007. The <a href="https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.18/developers.html.en#:~:text=Sandboxed%20Applications">first
release</a> was as XDG-App in 2015. It was renamed to Flatpak in 2016,
a nod to IKEA's "<a href="https://www.ikea.com/ph/en/this-is-ikea/about-us/the-story-of-ikea-flatpacks-puba710ccb0/">flatpacks</a>"
for delivering furniture.</p>

<p>The Flatpak project provides <a href="https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-command-reference.html#flatpak">command-line
tools</a> for managing and running Flatpak applications, tools for <a href="https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-builder-command-reference.html">building
Flatpak bundles</a>, and <a href="https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/available-runtimes.html">runtimes</a>
that provide components for Flatpak applications. The project uses <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/603762/">control groups</a>, <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/531114/">namespaces</a>,
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/281157/">bind mounts</a>, <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/332974/">seccomp</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap?tab=readme-ov-file#bubblewrap">Bubblewrap</a>
to provide application isolation ("sandboxing"). Flatpak content is 
primarily delivered using <a href="https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/introduction/">OSTree</a>,
though support for using <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/">Open
Container Initiative (OCI) images</a> has been <a href="https://opencontainers.org/posts/blog/2018-11-07-bringing-oci-images-to-the-desktop-with-flatpak/">available</a>
since 2018 and is used by Fedora for its Flatpak applications. The "<a href="https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/under-the-hood.html">Under
the Hood</a>" page from Flatpak's documentation provides a good
overview of how the pieces fit together.</p>

<h4>Slowing development</h4>

<p>Wick started his talk by saying that it looks like everything is
great with the Flatpak project, but if one looks deeper, "<q>you will
notice that it's not being actively developed anymore</q>". There are
people who maintain the code base and fix security issues, for
example, but "<q>bigger changes are not really happening
anymore</q>". He said that there are a bunch of merge requests for new
features, but no one feels responsible for reviewing them, and that is
kind of problematic.</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>The reason for the lack of reviewers is that key people, such as
Larsson, have left the project. Every now and then, Wick said, Larsson
may get involved if it's necessary, but he is basically not part of
the day-to-day development of the project. Wick said that it is hard
to get new Flatpak contributors involved because it can take months to
get feedback on major changes, and then more months to get another
review. "<q>This is really not a great way to get someone up to speed,
and it's not a great situation to be in</q>."</p>

<p>"<q>Maybe I'm complaining about something that is actually not that
much of an issue</q>", he said. Flatpak works; it does its job, and
"<q>we just use it and don't think about it much</q>". In that sense,
the project is in a good spot. But he has still been thinking
about how the project is "<q>living with constraints</q>" because
contributors do not have the opportunity to go in and make bigger
changes.</p>

<p>As an example, Wick said that Red Hat has been doing work that
would allow Flatpaks to be installed as part of a base
installation. The vendor or administrator could specify the
applications to be installed, and a program called
<tt>flatpak-preinstall</tt> would take care of the rest. The feature
has been implemented and is planned for inclusion in Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 10. The work was <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/pull/5832">started</a> by
Kalev Lember and Owen Taylor last June, but the original pull request
was <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/pull/5832#issuecomment-2630695788">closed</a>
by Lember in February as he was leaving Red Hat and would not be
working on it anymore. It was picked up by Wick in February as a <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/pull/6116">new request</a>
but wasn't reviewed until early May.</p>

<h4>OSTree and OCI</h4>

<p>Wick's next topic was OCI support in Flatpak. While OSTree has been
a success in some ways, and it is still being maintained, it is not
undergoing active development. He noted that developers have a
"<q>very narrow set of tools</q>" for working with OSTree, so building
Flatpaks that use OSTree requires non-standard and bespoke tools, but
there is a whole range of utilities available for working with OCI
images. Even better, tools for working with OCI images "<q>are all
developed by people other than us, which means we don't actually have
to do the work if we just embrace them</q>".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are a number of OCI-related improvements that,
again, are waiting on review to be merged into Flatpak. For example,
Wick mentioned that the OCI container standard has added <a href="https://github.com/containers/storage/blob/main/docs/containers-storage-zstd-chunked.md"><tt>zstd:chunked</tt></a>
support. Instead of the original OCI image format that uses gzipped
tarballs, the <tt>zstd:chunked</tt> images are compressed with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8478">zstd</a> and have
<a href="https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/dev/doc/zstd_compression_format.md#skippable-frames">skippable
frames</a> that include additional metadata—such as a table of
contents—which allows file-level deduplication. In short,
zstd:chunked allows pulling only those files that have changed since
the last update, rather than an entire OCI layer, when updating a
container image or a Flatpak.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/pull/5540">pull request</a>
from Taylor, submitted in September&nbsp;2023, that would add support
to Flatpak for zstd-compressed layers. It has received little
attention since then and "<q>it's just sitting there,
currently</q>".</p>

<h4>Narrowing permissions</h4>

<p>One of the key functions of Flatpak is to sandbox applications and
limit their access to the system. Wick said that the project has added
features to "<q>narrow down</q>" the sandboxes and provide more
restricted permissions. As an example, Flatpak now has
<tt>--device=input</tt> to allow an application to access input
devices without having access to all devices.</p>

<p>One problem with this, he said, is that a system's installation of
Flatpak may not support the newer features. A user's Linux
distribution may still be providing an older version of Flatpak that
does not have support for <tt>--device=input</tt>, or whatever new
feature that a Flatpak developer may wish to use. Wick said there
needs to be a way for applications to use the new permissions by
default, but fall back to the older permission models if used on a
system with an older version of Flatpak.</p>

<p>This isn't an entirely new situation, he said. "<q>We had this
before with Wayland and X11</q>", where if a system is running
Wayland, then Flatpak should not bind-mount an X11 socket. Now, there is a
similar scenario with the <a href="https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/docs/doc-org.freedesktop.portal.Usb.html">xdg-desktop portal
for USB access</a>, which was <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/pull/559">added</a>
to the xdg-desktop-project in 2021. Support for that portal was <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/4405">merged</a> into
Flatpak in 2024 after several iterations. What is missing is the
ability to specify backward-compatible permissions so that a Flatpak
application can be given USB access (<tt>--device=usb</tt>) with newer
versions of Flatpak but retain the <tt>--device=all</tt> permissions
if necessary. Once again, there is a <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/5681">pull request</a>
(from Hubert Figuière) that implements this, but Wick said that
"<q>it's also just sitting there</q>".</p>

<p>Wick would also like to improve the way that Flatpak handles access
to audio. Currently, Flatpak still uses <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/">PulseAudio</a>
even if a host system uses <a href="https://pipewire.org/">PipeWire</a>. The problem with that is
that PulseAudio bundles together access to speakers and
microphones—you can have access to both, or neither, but not just one. So
if an application has access to play sound, it also has access to
capture audio, which Wick said, with a bit of understatement, is
"<q>not great</q>". He would like to be able to use PipeWire, which
can expose restricted access to speakers only.</p>

<p>One thing that has been a bit of a pain point, Wick said, is that
nested sandboxing does not work in Flatpak. For instance, an
application cannot use Bubblewrap inside Flatpak. Many applications,
such as web browsers, make heavy use of sandboxing.</p>

<blockquote>
They really like to put their tabs into their own sandboxes because it
turns out that if one of those tabs is running some code that
manages to exploit and break out of the process there, at
least it's contained and doesn't spread to the rest of the
browser.
</blockquote>

<p>What Flatpak does instead, currently, is to have a kind of side
sandbox that applications can call to and spawn another Flatpak
instance that can be restricted even further. "<q>So, in that sense,
that is a solution to the problem, but it is also kind of fragile</q>."
There have been issues with this approach for quite a while, he said,
but no one knows quite how to solve them.</p>

<p>Ideally, Flatpak would simply support nested namespacing and nested
sandboxes, but currently it does not. Flatpak uses seccomp to prevent
applications in a sandbox from having direct access to user
namespaces. There is an API that can be used to create a sub-sandbox,
but it is more restrictive. He said that the restrictions to user
namespaces are outdated: "<q>for a long time it wasn't really a good
idea to expose user namespacing because it exposed a big kernel API to
user space that could be exploited</q>". Wick feels that user
namespaces are, nowadays, a well-tested and a much-used interface. He
does not think that there is much of a good argument against user
namespaces anymore.</p>

<h4>xdg-dbus-proxy</h4>

<p>Flatpak applications do not talk directly to D-Bus. Instead,
<tt>flatpak-run</tt> spawns an <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/xdg-dbus-proxy.1.en">xdg-dbus-proxy</a>
for every Flatpak instance that is "<q>not exactly in the same
sandbox, it's just on the side, basically</q>". The proxy is
responsible for setting up filtering according to rules that are
processed when <tt>flatpak-run</tt> is used to start an
application. When setting up the proxy, Flatpak starts with a
<tt>deny-all</tt> state and then adds specific connections that are
allowed. This is so that applications do not expose things that other
applications are not supposed to use.</p>

<p>Wick said that he would like to move filtering from xdg-dbus-proxy
directly to the D-Bus message brokers and provide policy based on a
cgroups path. This is not something that has been implemented
already, but he said he planned to work on a prototype in <a href="https://github.com/dbus2/busd?tab=readme-ov-file#busd">busd</a>,
which is a D-Bus broker implementation in Rust.</p>

<p>That would also allow for a more dynamic policy, which would allow
applications to export services to other applications on the
fly. Currently, the policy is set when a Flatpak is run, and can't be
modified afterward.</p>

<p>As a side note, that means that Flatpak applications cannot
talk to one another over D-Bus. They can still communicate
with other applications; for example, Wick said that applications can
communicate over the host's shared network namespace, "<q>which means
you can use HTTP or whatever, there are like thousands of side
channels you could use if you wanted to</q>".</p>

<p>Flatpak's network namespacing is "<q>kind of ugly, and I don't 
really have a good solution here</q>", Wick said, but he wanted to
point out that it is something the project should take a look
at. "<q>Like, you bind something on localhost and suddenly all
applications can just poke at it</q>". He gave the example of <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/de.bund.ausweisapp.ausweisapp2">AusweisApp</a>,
which is an official authentication app for German IDs 
that can be used to authenticate with government web sites. It
exposes a service on the local host, which makes it available to all
Flatpak applications on the system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is some of the stuff that I feel like we really need to take a
look at. I'm not sure if this is like directly exploitable, but at the
very least it's kind of scary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wick said that the project needs to create a network namespace for
Flatpak applications, "<q>but we don't really have any networking
experts around, which is kind of awkward, we really have to find a
solution here</q>".</p>

<p>Another awkward spot the project finds itself in, he said, is with
NVIDIA drivers. The project has to build multiple versions of NVIDIA
drivers for multiple runtimes that are supported, and that translates
to a great deal of network overhead for users who have to download
each of those versions—even if they don't need all of the
drivers. (<a href="https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=399518">This
complaint</a> on the Linux Mint forum illustrates the problem
nicely.) It also means that games packaged as Flatpaks need to be
continually updated against new runtimes, or they will eventually stop
working because their drivers stop being updated and the games will
not support current GPUs.</p>

<p>Wick's suggestion is to take a cue from Valve Software. He said
that Valve uses a model similar to Flatpak to run its games, but it
uses the drivers from the host system and loads all of the driver's
dependencies in the sandbox for the game. Valve uses the <a href="https://gitlab.collabora.com/vivek/libcapsule">libcapsule</a>
library to do this, which is "<q>kind of fragile</q>" and difficult to make
sure that it works well. Instead of using libcapsule, he would like to
statically compile drivers and share them between all Flatpak
applications. This is just in the idea stage at the moment, but
Wick said he would like to solve the driver problem eventually.</p>

<h4>Portals</h4>

<p>Portals are D-Bus interfaces that provide APIs for things like file
access, printing, opening URLs, and more. Flatpak can grant sandboxed
applications access to portals to make D-Bus calls. Wick noted
that portals are not part of the Flatpak project but they are crucial
to it. "<q>Whatever we do with portals just directly improves
Flatpak, and there are a bunch of portal things we need to
improve</q>".</p>

<p>He gave the example of the <a href="https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/docs/doc-org.freedesktop.portal.Documents.html">Documents</a>
portal, which makes files outside the sandbox available to Flatpak
applications. The Documents portal is great for sharing single files,
but it is too fine-grained and restrictive for other applications,
such as Blender, GIMP, or music applications, that may need to access
an entire library of files. "<q>You want a more coarse-grained
permission model for files at some point</q>". There are some
possibilities, he said, such as bind mounting user-selected host
locations into the sandbox.</p>

<p>Wick had a number of ideas that he would like to see implemented
for portals, such as support for autofilling passwords, Fast Identity
Online (FIDO) security keys, speech synthesis, and more. He
acknowledged that it's "<q>kind of hard to write</q>" code for portals
right now, but there is work to make it easier by using <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libdex">libdex</a>. (See
Christian Hergert's <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/chergert/2025/03/27/fiber-cancellation-in-libdex/">blog
post</a> on libdex for a short look at this.) It might even make sense
to rewrite things in Rust, he said.</p>

<h4>Flatpak-next</h4>

<p>Assume that it's ten years in the future, Wick said, and no one is
working on Flatpak anymore. "<q>What would you do with Flatpak if you
could just rewrite it? I think the vision where we should go is OCI
for almost everything.</q>" Larsson's choices in creating Flatpak
were good and sound technical decisions at the time, but they
ended up being "<q>not the thing that everyone else has</q>". That is
an issue because only a few people understand what Flatpak does, and
the project has to do everything itself.</p>

<p>But, he said, if the project did "<q>everything OCI</q>", it would
get a lot of things for free, such as OCI registries and tooling. Then
it just comes down to what <tt>flatpak-run</tt> has to do, and that
would not be very much. Rethinking Flatpak with modern container tools
and aligning with the wider container ecosystem, he said, would make
everything easier and is worth exploring. Once again, he floated the
idea of using Rust for a rewrite.</p>

<h4>Q&amp;A</h4>

<p>There was a little time for questions at the end of Wick's
session. The first was about what happens to existing Flatpaks if the
project moves to OCI tooling. "<q>Would I need to just throw away
[applications] and download again, or is that too much in the future,
and you haven't thought about that?</q>" Wick said that it would be an
issue on the client side, but Flathub (for example) has all of the
build instructions for its Flatpaks and could simply rebuild them.</p>

<p>Another audience member was concerned about using container
infrastructure. They said that OCI registries that store images are
missing indexing and metadata that is consumed by applications like
GNOME Software for Flatpaks. What would be the way forward to ensure
that they could preserve the same user experience? Wick said that
there is now a standard for storing non-images in OCI registries,
which would allow storing "<q>the same things we're currently
storing</q>" for Flatpak, but writing the code to do it and getting it
merged would be the hard part.</p>

<p>The final question was whether there was anything concrete planned
about using PipeWire directly with Flatpak rather than the PulseAudio
routing. Wick said that he had been talking with Wim Taymans, the
creator of PipeWire, about how to add support for it within
Flatpak. It is mostly about "<q>adding PipeWire policy to do the right
thing when it knows that it is a Flatpak instance</q>", he said.</p>

<p>When it comes to calendars, you can choose between using a digital calendar app or getting a paper calendar. They both allow you to keep track of things like doctor appointments, work meetings or birthdays, so you can keep a clear head and be sure that you won’t forget anything. But while the two approaches may seem similar on the surface, they’re radically different in the kinds of trade-offs they make.</p>
<p>In this project, we’re exploring what it would mean to have a calendar that combines the convenience of a digital calendar with the simplicity and expressivity you get from pen &amp; paper.</p>
<h2>Calendar apps</h2>
<p>On the one hand, calendar apps like Google Calendar offer many convenient features. You can easily switch between different (daily, weekly and monthly) views. All your events are synced across your devices. You can send calendar invites and even create shared calendars with other people, so when you plan something that affects others, you can check their availability.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ink/notes/sketchy-calendar/google-calendar.png" alt="Weekly calendar of the author"></p>
<p>While powerful, Google Calendar’s design imposes a strict view of what a calendar event is. If you have tentative plans like “lunch with a friend sometime next week” there is no obvious way to add this to your calendar in a way that differentiates it from an important appointment that can’t be missed.</p>
<p>Calendar apps can also feel very sterile and impersonal. All events are visually uniform, regardless of importance, even across different contexts. Events on my company calendar (which I only need to see for coordination) exist alongside my personal commitments with no visual hierarchy.</p>
<p>A calendar app <em>could</em> be a deeply personal place for collecting memories, which allows users to reflect on how they are spending their time. In practice, calendar apps are primarily a tool for scheduling meetings.</p>
<h2>Paper calendars</h2>
<p>In contrast, using pen &amp; paper is much more flexible. You can get calendars that offer varying degrees of structure, from completely blank notebooks with no imposed format to more structured planners that have preprinted pages for months, weeks, and days with dedicated sections for things like tasks and timelines. The preprinted structure acts more like a guideline than a requirement. It is easy to ignore: Users can draw arrows, doodle, and mark rough timeframes for activities, without being forced to fit a predetermined schema.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ink/notes/sketchy-calendar/physical-notebook.jpg" alt="Different notebooks offer different structures"></p>
<p>This versatility extends way beyond scheduling events—the same pages can accommodate things like meeting notes, meal plans, to-dos, and habit tracking.
Unlike apps that can only capture events, paper calendars grow naturally into personal spaces, capable of capturing the various aspects of daily life, like meal plans, to-do lists or habit trackers.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ink/notes/sketchy-calendar/usecases-physical-notebook.jpg" alt="People use notebooks to create meal plans, to-do lists and habit trackers"></p>
<h2>Can we combine both worlds?</h2>
<p>What if you could have a digital calendar that combined the strengths of both the paper and the digital world?</p>
<p>Some calendar apps have attempted to address this question by <em>adding more features</em>. <a href="https://www.hey.com/calendar/">Hey Calendar</a>, for example, allows users to personalize their calendar by assigning titles or background images to days. Beyond events, users can also add unscheduled to-dos and track daily habits.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ink/notes/sketchy-calendar/hey-calendar.png" alt="Hey calendar, a calendar app with habit tracking todo list and other customization features"></p>
<p>While certainly an improvement over regular calendar apps, they remain constrained to the limits of the ‘app’ paradigm: users cannot customize their experience in ways the developers didn’t anticipate, they’re stuck with workarounds or feature requests that — if implemented — will inevitably lead to feature creep, which will add complexity for all users.</p>
<p>Instead, we’re interested in taking the paper calendar as a starting point. Pen &amp; paper, straight out of the box, affords a level of customization and personalization that we rarely see in the world of software. But its unstructured nature also makes it difficult to add any of the convenient functionalities that we get when we digitize information. This project explores this trade-off. How far can we get by taking a simple digital notebook (iPad &amp; pencil) and adding a small amount of structure?</p>
<p>These are some of the questions we intend to explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it possible to create interconnected daily, weekly and monthly views like a traditional calendar app?</li>
<li>How might sketched annotations meaningfully interact with formal calendar events?</li>
<li>How would shared calendars or calendar invites work in such a semi-structured system?</li>
<li>How can users personalize their calendars by adding custom dynamic behavior? For example, how might I add a habit tracker or a time tracker, all while preserving the sketchy, personal quality?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a little sneak preview of what a sketchy calendar could look like. We will soon
share more about how this works and what we’ve learned building it.</p>

For decades, the telecom giant—nicknamed “Ma Bell”—had dominated American voice communications, with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Electric" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Western Electric</a> subsidiary manufacturing nearly every telephone found in U.S. homes and offices. The U.S. federal government was pressing for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-end-of-att" target="_self">antitrust-driven divestiture</a>, but AT&amp;T was granted an opening to expand into computing.</p><p>With computing firms already entrenched in the market, AT&amp;T couldn’t afford to play catch-up; its strategy was to leap ahead, and the Bellmac-32 was its springboard.</p><p>The Bellmac-32 chip series has now been honored with an<a href="https://ieeemilestones.ethw.org/Main_Page" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> IEEE Milestone</a>.

PMOS chips, which depend on the movement of positively-charged holes, were too slow. CMOS, with its hybrid design, offered the potential for both speed and energy savings. The benefits were so compelling that the industry soon saw that the need for double the number of transistors (NMOS and PMOS for each gate) was worth the tradeoff.</p><p>As transistor sizes shrank along with the rapid advancement of semiconductor technology described by <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/five-things-you-might-not-know-about-moores-law" target="_self">Moore’s Law</a>, the cost of doubling up the transistor density soon became manageable and eventually became negligible. But when Bell Labs took its high-stakes gamble, large-scale CMOS fabrication was still unproven and looked to be comparatively costly.</p><p>That didn’t deter Bell Labs. By tapping expertise from its campuses in Holmdel and Murray Hill as well as in Naperville, Ill., the company assembled a dream team of semiconductor engineers. The team included Condry;<a href="https://nisl.soe.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Sung-Mo “Steve” Kang</a>, a rising star in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/chip-design">chip design</a>;  <a href="https://sagetechnologyresources.com/?team=victor-huang" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Victor Huang</a>, another microprocessor chip designer, and dozens of AT&amp;T Bell Labs employees. They set out in 1978 to master a new CMOS process and create a 32-bit microprocessor from scratch.</p><h2>Designing the architecture</h2><p>The architecture group led by Condry, an IEEE Life Fellow who would later become Intel’s CTO, focused on building a system that would natively support the <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/Unix" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Unix</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/operating-system">operating system</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">C programming language</a>. Both were in their infancy but destined for dominance. To cope with the era’s memory limitations—kilobytes were precious—they introduced a complex instruction set that required fewer steps to carry out and could be executed in a single clock cycle.</p><p>The engineers also built the chip to support the <a href="https://www.vita.com/VMEbus-FAQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">VersaModule Eurocard (VME) parallel bus</a>, enabling <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/distributed-computing">distributed computing</a> so several nodes could handle data processing in parallel. Making the chip VME-enabled also allowed it to be used for real-time control.</p><p>The group wrote its own version of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/unix">Unix</a>, with real-time capabilities to ensure that the new chip design was compatible with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/industrial-automation">industrial automation</a> and similar applications. The Bell Labs engineers also invented<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_logic" target="_blank"> domino logic</a>, which ramped up processing speed by reducing delays in complex <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/logic-gates">logic gates</a>.</p><p>Additional testing and verification techniques were developed and introduced via the Bellmac-32 Module, a sophisticated multi-chipset verification and testing project led by Huang that allowed the complex <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/chip-fabrication">chip fabrication</a> to have zero or near-zero errors. This was the first of its kind in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/vlsi">VLSI</a> testing. The Bell Labs engineers’ systematic plan for double- and triple-checking their colleagues’ work ultimately made the total design of the multiple chipset family work together seamlessly as a complete microcomputer system.</p><p>Then came the hardest part: actually building the chip.</p><h2>Floor maps and colored pencils</h2><p>“The technology for layout, testing, and high-yield fabrication just wasn’t there,” recalls Kang, an IEEE Life Fellow who later became president of the <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology</a> (<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/kaist">KAIST</a>) in Daejeon, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/south-korea">South Korea</a>. With no <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cad">CAD</a> tools available for full-chip verification, Kang says, the team resorted to printing oversize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcomp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Calcomp</a> plots. The schematics showed how the transistors, circuit lines, and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/interconnects">interconnects</a> should be arranged inside the chip to provide the desired outputs. The team assembled them on the floor with adhesive tape to create a massive square map more than 6 meters on a side. Kang and his colleagues traced every circuit by hand with colored pencils, searching for breaks, overlaps, or mishandled interconnects.</p><h2>Getting it made</h2><p>Once the physical design was locked in, the team faced another obstacle: manufacturing. The chips were fabricated at a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/western-electric">Western Electric</a> facility in Allentown, Pa., but Kang recalls that the yield rates (the percentage of chips on a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/silicon-wafer">silicon wafer</a> that meet performance and quality standards) were dismal.</p><p>To address that, Kang and his colleagues drove from New Jersey to the plant each day, rolled up their sleeves, and did whatever it took, including sweeping floors and calibrating test equipment, to build camaraderie and instill confidence that the most complicated product the plant workers had ever attempted to produce could indeed be made there.</p><p>“We weren’t just building a faster chip. We were trying to design something that could carry both voice and computation into the future.” <strong>—Michael Condry, Bellmac-32 architecture team lead</strong></p><p>“The team-building worked out well,” Kang says. “After several months, Western Electric was able to produce more than the required number of good chips.”</p><p>The first version of the Bellmac-32, which was ready by 1980, fell short of expectations. Instead of hitting a 4-megahertz performance target, it ran at just 2 MHz. The engineers discovered that the state-of-the-art <a href="https://www.chiphistory.org/143-takeda-riken-reliability-drives-growth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Takeda Riken</a> testing equipment they were using was flawed, with transmission-line effects between the probe and the test head leading to inaccurate measurements, so they worked with a Takeda <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/riken">Riken</a> team to develop correction tables that rectified the measurement errors.</p><p>The second generation of Bellmac chips had <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/clock-speeds">clock speeds</a> that exceeded 6.2 MHz, sometimes reaching 9. That was blazing fast for its time. The 16-bit <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/intel">Intel</a> 8088 processor inside IBM’s original PC released in 1981 <a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object/nmah_713506#:~:text=Intel%208088.,4.77%20MHz%20and%2064K%20Memory." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ran at 4.77 MHz</a>.</p><h2>Why Bellmac-32 didn’t go mainstream</h2><p>Despite its technical promise, the Bellmac-32 did not find wide commercial use. According to Condry, AT&amp;T’s pivot toward acquiring equipment manufacturer<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCR_Voyix" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> NCR</a>, which it began eyeing in the late 1980s, meant the company chose to back a different line of chips. But by then, the Bellmac-32’s legacy was already growing.</p><p>“Before Bellmac-32, NMOS was dominant,” Condry says. “But CMOS changed the market because it was shown to be a more effective implementation in the fab.”</p><p>In time, that realization reshaped the semiconductor landscape. CMOS would become the foundation for modern <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/microprocessors">microprocessors</a>, powering the digital revolution in desktops, smartphones, and more.</p><p>The audacity of Bell Labs’ bet—to take an untested fabrication process and leapfrog an entire generation of chip architecture—stands as a landmark moment in technological history.</p><p>As Kang puts it: “We were on the frontier of what was possible. We didn’t just follow the path—we made a new one.” Huang, an IEEE Life Fellow who later became deputy director of the<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ime" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Institute of Microelectronics, Singapore</a>, adds: “This included not only chip architecture and design, but also large-scale chip verification—with CAD but without today’s digital simulation tools or even breadboarding [which is the standard method for checking whether a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/circuit-design">circuit design</a> for an electronic system that uses chips works before making permanent connections by <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/soldering">soldering</a> the circuit elements together].” </p><p>Condry, Kang, and Huang look back fondly on that period and express their admiration for the many AT&amp;T employees whose skill and dedication made the Bellmac-32 chip series possible.</p><p>Administered by the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/about/history-center/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE History Center</a> and supported by donors, the Milestone program recognizes outstanding technical developments around the world. The <a href="https://r1.ieee.org/northjersey/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE North Jersey Section</a> sponsored the nomination.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">de·​fud·dle /diˈfʌdl/ <em>transitive verb</em><br>
to remove unnecessary elements from a web page, and make it easily readable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Beware! Defuddle is very much a work in progress!</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Defuddle extracts the main content from web pages. It cleans up web pages by removing clutter like comments, sidebars, headers, footers, and other non-essential elements, leaving only the primary content.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://kepano.github.io/defuddle/" rel="nofollow">Try the Defuddle Playground →</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Defuddle aims to output clean and consistent HTML documents. It was written for <a href="https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-clipper">Obsidian Web Clipper</a> with the goal of creating a more useful input for HTML-to-Markdown converters like <a href="https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown">Turndown</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Defuddle can be used as a replacement for <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/readability">Mozilla Readability</a> with a few differences:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>More forgiving, removes fewer uncertain elements.</li>
<li>Provides a consistent output for footnotes, math, code blocks, etc.</li>
<li>Uses a page's mobile styles to guess at unnecessary elements.</li>
<li>Extracts more metadata from the page, including schema.org data.</li>
</ul>

Not just creating them, but actually finishing them; "<strong>fully shipped into production</strong>". All whilst having less than a minute of API unreliability for the entire year.</p><p>Stripe has roughly 8,500 employees (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stripe-layoffs-staff-payments-memo-2025-1?international=true&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T&amp;ref=saile.it#:~:text=Stripe%20had%208%2C500%20employees">BI, 2025</a>). 40% or so in engineering (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2022/05/26/stripe-exclusive-interview-collison-brothers-95-billion-plan-to-stay-on-top/?ref=saile.it#:~:text=more%20than%2040%25%20of%20the%20company%20is%20still%20engineers">Forbes, 2022</a>). With some napkin math assuming a similar distribution today, that would mean on average each engineer ships at least 1 change to production every 3 days. That is pretty incredible for the scale at which Stripe operates ($1.4 trillion(!) payment volume <a href="https://assets.stripeassets.com/fzn2n1nzq965/2pt3yIHthraqR1KwXgr98U/b6301040587a62d5b6ef7b76c904032d/Stripe-annual-letter-2024.pdf?ref=saile.it">in 2024</a>).</p><p>Though Stripe is well-known for their strong engineering culture, a number like that really puts things into perspective. According to <a href="https://dora.dev/research/2024/dora-report/?ref=saile.it">DORA 2024</a> (research by Google on software delivery &amp; operations) elite software delivery performance does "multiple deploys per day" with a 5% failure rate. It's probably not a stretch to say Stripe is in the top 1% of elite performers by these measurements alone. </p><h2 id="one-thousand-one-hundred-forty-five-deployments-to-production-per-day">One thousand one hundred forty-five deployments to production. Per day.</h2><p>To achieve that kind of delivery performance with that many people is honestly amazing. On its own, the "1 change to production every 3 days" per engineer might get mixed reactions. "We did 5 production deploys in one day at company XYZ!". But did they do it consistently for an entire year? With less than a minute of downtime?</p><p>It's not impossible but just thinking about the throughput really says something about how the ship is being run. Shipping safely at this velocity and scale implies heavy investment in automated tests, deployments, rollbacks, observability, code ownership and so forth. All those things pop-up in your favorite flavor of devops survey but you rarely see it operationalized at this level.</p><p>There are quite a few nuggets scattered on the internet regarding how Stripe does things (ex. <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2020/10/09/four-years-at-stripe/?ref=saile.it">#1</a>, <a href="https://samgerstenzang.substack.com/p/operating-well-what-i-learned-at?ref=saile.it">#2</a>, <a href="https://every.to/p/what-i-miss-about-working-at-stripe?ref=saile.it">#3</a>) and in general the conclusion is that they have a very demanding but very advanced engineering culture.</p><blockquote>[...] what I learned at Stripe was nothing like I had experienced in more than 20 years in the industry.<br><a href="https://steinkamp.us/posts/2022-11-10-what-i-learned-at-stripe?ref=saile.it">What I Learned At Stripe (Steinkamp, 2022)</a></blockquote><p>Few companies operate at Stripe's scale, intensity and mission-critical level. But that shouldn't be a deterrence for aspiring to this kind of clarity, confidence, and velocity in engineering. It's a reflection of engineering culture done right; trusting changes, the tooling necessary to do that, autonomy of engineers and a relentless focus on continuously shipping value for users.</p><p>The goal is not 1,145 deployments per day. It's removing the friction that makes that pace impossible. What's really stopping you from rapidly shipping value to users?</p>

<p><b>tl;dr</b> This post shows how to create loaded dice, and how to use these dice to gain between 5-15 additional resource cards per game of Settlers of Catan. </p><!--
Surprisingly, we'll prove that your opponents cannot use the standard scientific method to prove that the dice are loaded in the middle of a game.
--><p> Surprisingly, we’ll prove that standard scientific tests are not powerful enough to determine that the dice are unfair while playing a game. This essentially means that it’s impossible for your opponents to scientifically prove that you’re cheating. This impossibility is due to methodological defects in the current state of scientific practice, and we’ll highlight some ongoing work to fix these defects.

<h3 id="loading-the-dice">Loading the dice</h3>
<p>My copy of Settlers of Catan came with two normal wooden dice. To load these dice, I placed them in a small plate of water overnight, leaving the 6 side exposed.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/wooden-dice-in-water.jpg">
</center>
<p>The submerged area absorbed water, becoming heavier. My hope was that when rolled, the heavier wet sides would be more likely to land face down, and the lighter dry side would be more likely to land face up. So by leaving the 6 exposed, I was hoping to create dice that roll 6’s more often.</p>
<!--
I left the dice in overnight for about 12 hours.
After drying for another hour, the dice look dry on the outside,
but they still have 0.1 grams of water hidden inside.
Before soaking they weighed 0.65 grams,
and afterward they weighed 0.75 grams.
-->
<!--
If you have a newer game with plastic dice,
you can [follow these instructions](http://www.instructables.com/id/Loaded-Dice/) to create loaded dice or simply [buy some from amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Character-Builder-Loaded-Koplow-Games/dp/B001N1JIU8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1512718476&sr=8-2&keywords=loaded+dice).

<p>This effect is called the <em>bias</em> of the dice. To measure this bias, my wife and I spent the next 7 days rolling dice while eating dinner. (She must love me a <em>lot</em>!)</p>

<p>Looking at the data, it’s “obvious” that our dice are biased: The 6 gets rolled more times than any of the other numbers. Before we prove this bias formally, however, let’s design a strategy to exploit this bias while playing Settlers of Catan.</p>
<h3 id="a-strategy-for-loaded-dice">A strategy for loaded dice</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.settlers-strategy.com/settlers_of_catan_strategy_placement_1.html">key to winning at Settlers of Catan</a> is to get a lot of resources. We want to figure out how many extra resources we can get using our biased dice.</p>
<p>First, let’s quickly review the rules. Each settlement is placed on the corner of three tiles, and each tile has a number token. Whenever the dice are rolled, if they add up to one of the numbers on the tokens, you collect the corresponding resource card. For example:</p>
<center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/settlers-of-catan-rules-dice-resource.jpg">
</center>
<p>A good settlement will be placed next to numbers that will be rolled often.</p>
<p>To make strategizing easier, the game designers put helpful dots on each token below the number. These dots count the ways to roll that token’s number using two dice.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/settlers-numbers-pips.jpg">
</center>
<p>We can use these dots to calculate the probability of rolling each number. For example, a <span>\(4\)</span> can be rolled in three ways. If we name our two dice <span>\(A\)</span> and <span>\(B\)</span>, then the possible combinations are <span>\((A=1,B=3)\)</span>, <span>\((A=2,B=2)\)</span>, <span>\((A=3,B=1)\)</span>. To calculate the probability of rolling a 4, we calculate the probability of each of these rolls and add them together. For fair dice, the probability of every roll is the same <span>\((1/6)\)</span>, so the calculation is:</p>
<p><span>\[\begin{align}
Pr(A+B = 4) 
&amp;= Pr(A = 1)Pr(B=3) + Pr(A=2)Pr(B=2) + Pr(A=3)Pr(B=1)    \\
&amp;= (1/6)(1/6) + (1/6)(1/6) + (1/6)(1/6)              \\
&amp;= 1/12                                 \\
&amp;\approx 0.08333
\end{align}\]</span></p><!--
To calculate the probability of rolling each number:
(1) list the ways of rolling that number,
(2) calculate the probability of each combination,
and (3) sum the results.
For example,
-->
<p>For our biased dice, the probability of each roll is different. Using the numbers from the table above, we get:</p>
<p><span>\[\begin{align}
Pr(A+B = 4) 
&amp;= Pr(A = 1)Pr(B=3) + Pr(A=2)Pr(B=2) + Pr(A=3)Pr(B=1)    \\
&amp;= (0.151)(0.157) + (0.169)(0.169) + (0.157)(0.151)      \\
&amp;= 0.07597
\end{align}\]</span></p><p>So rolling a <span>\(4\)</span> is now less likely with our biased dice. Performing this calculation for each possible number gives us the following chart.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/twodice.png">
</center>
<p>All the numbers below <span>\(7\)</span> are now less likely, and the numbers above 7 are now more likely. The shift is small, but it has important strategic implications.</p>
<p>Consider the two initial settlement placements below.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/red-v-blue-settlers2.png">
</center>
<p>The <span color="red">naughty</span> player knows that the dice are biased and puts her settlements on locations with high numbers, but the <span color="blue">nice</span> player doesn’t know the dice are biased and puts her settlements on locations with low numbers. Notice that if the dice were fair, both settlement locations would be equally good because they have the same number of dots.</p>
<p>The following formula calculates the average number of cards a player receives on each dice roll:</p>
<p><span>\[
\text{expected cards per roll} = \sum_{\text{adjacent tokens}} Pr(A+B=\text{token value})
\]</span></p>
<p>Substituting the appropriate values gives us the following results.</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td colspan="3">
<center>

</tbody></table>

<p>So the difference between the <span color="red">naughty</span> and <span color="blue">nice</span> player is <span>\(0.086\)</span> cards per roll of the biased dice. A typical game of Settlers contains about 60 dice rolls (about 15 turns per player in a 4 player game), so this results in <span>\(0.086*60=5.16\)</span> more cards for the <span color="red">naughty</span> player. <!--
By varying the exact number tokens in the scenario above,
we can get this difference to be anywhere from $4.9$ to $5.4$.
--></p>
<p>And this is only considering the two starting settlements. As the game progresses, more settlements will be built, and some settlements will be upgraded to cities (which receive two cards per roll instead of one). Calculating the exact effect of these additional sources of cards is difficult because these improvements will be built at random points throughout the game. We’ll have to make some additional assumptions.</p>
<p>If we assume that the <span color="red">naughty</span> player gets 0.043 more cards per roll per settlement/city than the <span color="blue">nice</span> player (this exact number will vary depending on the quality of the settlement), and that both players build settlement/cities at turns 10,20,25,30,35,40,45, and 50, then the <span color="red">naughty</span> player will on average receive 15.050 more cards than the <span color="blue">nice</span> player.</p>
<p>To summarize, the <span color="red">naughty</span> player will receive somewhere between 5 and 15 more resource cards depending on how their future settlements and cities are built. This advantage can’t guarantee a victory, but it’ll definitely help.</p>
<h3 id="a-scientific-analysis">A scientific analysis</h3><p>
Now we’re going to do some simple statistics to prove two things:
</p><ol>
<li>
The dice really are biased. So the fact that the 6 was rolled more times than the other numbers wasn’t just due to random chance.
</li><li>
There are not enough dice rolls in a game of Settlers for our opponents to scientifically prove that the dice are biased. So it’s scientifically impossible for our opponents to know that we’re cheating.
</li></ol>
<!--
Proving that the dice are biased uses a subtle statistical argument called [hypothesis testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing).
To prove that the dice are really biased,
we use a statistical proof by contradiction.
-->
<p>To show that the dice are biased, we will use a standard scientific technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing#Null_hypothesis_statistical_significance_testing">null hypothesis significance testing</a>. <!-- the [$p$-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value).--> We begin by assuming a hypothesis that we want to <em>disprove</em>. In our case, we assume that the dice are <em>not</em> biased. In other words, we assume that each number on the dice has a <span>\(1/6\approx 0.166\)</span> chance of being rolled. <!--(This assumption is called a [null hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis).)--> Our goal is to show that under this assumption, the number of 6’s rolled above is very unlikely. We therefore conclude that our hypothesis is also unlikely, and that the dice probably are in fact biased.</p>
<!--
To accomplish this task, we'll compute a [$p$-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value).
--><p>
More formally, we let <span>\(X\)</span> be a random variable that represents the total number of 6’s we would roll if we were to repeat our initial experiment with fair dice. Then <span>\(X\)</span> follows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">binomial distribution</a> whose density is plotted below.
</p><center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/binomial.png">
</center><p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value"><span>\(p\)</span>-value</a> for our experiment is defined informally to be the probability of getting results similar to the results we observed if the dice are <em>not</em> biased. The formal definition and formula is
<span>\[\begin{equation}
p\text{-value}=
Pr(X\ge k)
=
%1-\sum_{i=0}^k {4310\choose 812} (1/6)^i(1-1/6)^{n-i}
1-\sum_{i=0}^k {n\choose k} q^i(1-q)^{n-i}
,
\end{equation}\]</span></p><p>where <span>\(n\)</span> is the total number of dice rolls (4310), <span>\(k\)</span> is the number of 6’s actually rolled (812), and <span>\(q\)</span> is the assumed probability of rolling a 6 (1/6). Substituting these numbers gives us <span>\[
p\text{-value}=
Pr(X\ge k)
\approx
0.0000884
.
\]</span> In other words, if we repeated this experiment one million times with fair dice, we would expect to get results similar to the results we actually got only 88 times. Since this is so unlikely, we conclude that our original assumption (that the dice are not biased) is probably false. Most science classes teach that <span>\(p\)</span>-values less than 0.05 are “significant.” We are very far below that threshold, so our result is “very significant.”</p>
<!--
There is no intrinsic reason why $p$-values less than 0.05 should

<!--<center><img src=/img/settlers/reaction.gif></centeR>-->
<p>Our <span>\(p\)</span>-value is so low because the number of trials we conducted was very large <span>\((n=4310)\)</span>. In a typical game of Settlers, however, there will be many fewer trials. This makes it hard for our opponents to prove that we’re cheating.</p>
<p>We said before that there are 60 dice rolls in a typical game. Since we have two dice, that means <span>\(n=120\)</span>. To keep the math simple, we’ll assume that we role an average number of 6’s. That is, the number of sixes rolled during the game is <span>\[
k=812\cdot \frac{120}{4310}\approx23.
\]</span> Substituting into our formula for the <span>\(p\)</span>-value, we get <span>\[
p\text{-value}=P(X\ge k) \approx 0.265
.
\]</span> In words, this means that if the dice were actually fair, then we would still role this number of 6’s <span>\(26.5\%\)</span> of the time. Since this probability is so high, the standard scientific protocol tells us to conclude that we have no “significant” evidence that the dice are biased. (Notice that this is subtly different from having evidence that the dice are not biased! Confusing these two statements is a common mistake, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4877414/">even for trained phd scientists</a>, and <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/17/statistical-literacy-among-doctors-now-lower-than-chance/">especially for medical doctors</a>.)</p>
<p>So how many games can we play without getting caught? It turns out that if we play 6 games (so <span>\(n=6*120=720\)</span>, and <span>\(k=812\cdot(720/4310)\approx136\)</span>), then the resulting <span>\(p\)</span>-value is 0.05. In other words, as long as we play fewer than 6 games, then our opponents won’t have enough data to conclude that their measurements of the biased dice are “significant.” The standard scientific method won’t prove we’re cheating.</p>
<!--
The density of the binomial distribution is
$$
Pr(X=k) = {n \choose k} q^k(1-q)^{n-k}
%,

In our case, $n=4310$ and $q=1/6$.
Plotting the resulting function gives us
<center><img src=/img/settlers/binomial.png></center>

The definition of the $p$-value is
\begin{equation}
Pr(X\ge x | H)
=
1-\sum_{i=0}^k {n\choose k} p^i(1-p)^{n-i}
\end{equation}

Substituting $q=1/6\approx0.16666$ gives us a p-value of $0$.
-->
<!--If we instead use $q=0.186$, then our p-value comes out to be $0.044$.-->
<h3 id="some-flaws-with-the-p-value-and-significance">Some flaws with the <span>\(p\)</span>-value and “significance”</h3>
<p>The <span>\(p\)</span>-value argument above is how most scientists currently test their hypotheses. But there’s some major flaws with this approach. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <span>\(p\)</span>-value test doesn’t use all the available information. In particular, our opponents may have other reasons to believe that the dice are loaded. If you look closely at the dice, you’ll notice some slight discoloration where it was submerged in water.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://izbicki.me/img/settlers/dice-discolored2.jpg" width="650">
</center>
<p>This discoloration was caused because the water spread the ink on the die’s face. If you see similar discoloration on the dice in your game, it makes sense to be extra suspicious about the dice’s bias.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s no way to incorporate this suspicion into the <span>\(p\)</span>-value analysis we conducted above. An alternative to the <span>\(p\)</span>-value called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor">bayes factor</a> can incorporate this prior evidence. So if our opponent uses a bayes factor analysis, they may be able to determine that we’re cheating. The bayes factor is more complicated than the <span>\(p\)</span>-value, however, and so it is not widely taught to undergraduate science majors. It is rarely even used in phd-level scientific publications, and many statisticians are calling for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-07522-z">increased use of these more sophisticated analysis techniques</a>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Another weakness of the <span>\(p\)</span>-value test is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives">false positives</a> are very common. Using the standard significance threshold of <span>\(p\le0.05\)</span> means that 5 of every 100 games will have “significant” evidence that the dice are biased to role 6’s. Common sense, however, tells us that cheating at Settlers of Catan is almost certainly not this common because most people just don’t want to cheat. But when you run many experiments, some of them will give “significant” results just by random chance. This is one of the many reasons why some scientists have concluded that <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">most published research is false</a>. This effect is thought to be one of the reasons that <a href="https://understandinguncertainty.org/node/1286">evidence of extra sensorial perception (ESP) continues to be published in scientific journals</a>. Some less scrupulous scientists exploit this deficiency in a process called <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002106">p-hacking</a> to make their research seem more important.</p>
<p>To alleviate the problem of false positives, <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/big-names-in-statistics-want-to-shake-up-much-maligned-p-value-1.22375">a group of statisticians is proposing a new significance threshold of <span>\(p\le0.005\)</span></a> for a result to qualify as “significant”. While this reduces the risk of false positives, it also makes detecting true effects harder. Under this new criterion, we’d have to play 16 games (for <span>\(n=1920\)</span> dice roles) to get statistically significant evidence that the dice are biased.</p>
<!--
<li>
It's easy to lie with $p$-values.
What if instead of loading the dice so that 6's came up more often,
we loaded the dice so that a different number came up more often?
What if we loaded the dice in such a way that only I knew 

This technique called [p-hacking](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002106) is currently a major problem in the [biological](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/37/E5112.short) and social sciences.
-->
</li></ol>
<p>At this point, you might be feeling overwhelmed at the complexity of statistical analysis. And this is just for the toy problem of detecting loaded dice in a game. Real world problems like evaluating the effectiveness of chemotherapy drugs are much more complicated, and so require much more complicated statistical analyses. Doing science is hard!</p>

<p><b>Edit after peer review:</b> <a href="http://http//vijaylulla.com/">Vijay Lulla</a> sent me the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
<i> The blog mentions that you rolled the dice 4310 times and all your calculations are based on it, but the frequency table adds up to 4312. </i>

<p>Whooops! It looks like a messed up my addition. Fortunately, this mistake is small enough that it won’t affect any of the numbers in the article by much.</p>
<p>A lot of people mistakenly think that peer review is where other scientists repeat an experiment to test the conclusion. But that’s not the case. The purpose for peer review is for scientists like Vijay to just do a sanity check on the whole procedure to make sure obvious mistakes like this get caught. Sadly, another commonly made mistake in science is that <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2015/06/17/born-open-data/">researchers don’t publish their data</a>, so there’s no way for checks like this to be performed.</p>
<p>If this were a real publication in a scientific journal, I would redo all the calculations. But since it’s not, I’ll leave the mistake for posterity.</p>
<p><b>Edit 2:</b> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/7k0ufr/i_wrote_a_blog_post_about_using_settlers_of_catan/">There’s a good discussion on reddit’s /r/statistics</a>. This discussion provides a much more nuanced view about significance testing than my discussion above, and a few users point out ways that I might be overstating some conclusions.</p>

Doing science right is much harder than most people believe.

<hr>

[Settlers of Catan](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005BM07P0) is a great board game... but I hate losing at it... so I figured out a way to cheat.  In the game, dice are used to determine which resource cards you collect.  For example, if the number nine is rolled, and you have a settlement next to a nine, you'll get some resources.  Obviously, more resources helps you win.  So if we load the dice, we can control which numbers come up more frequently, helping us win more often.  This post describes how to physically load the dice and how to do statistical tests to prove we'll win more often.

![]()

In a previous post, we saw that it's [pretty hard to make a loaded coin](/blog/how-to-create-an-unfair-coin-and-prove-it-with-math.html).  But making loaded dice is actually pretty easy.  I decided to make make the number six come up more often than every other number.  To do this, we'll add some weight to the opposite side as the six.  Since the numbers on opposite sides of dice always add to seven, we'll have to add weight to the one side.  When we roll the dice, the weight will pull the one down towards the table, pushing the six to the top.

Amazon sells [preweighted dice](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008Z23BOM) that you can buy.  But it's really easy to weight the dice that come with Settlers of Catan yourself.  The dice are made out of wood---if we set them in water, the wood will absorb the water.  The water weighs down that side of the dice.  

The picture below shows the two settlers dice in a small dish.  If you look closely, you can see there is water covering just the bottom of the dice:

![settlers dice sitting in water to get biased and weighted](/img/dice/in-water.jpg)

My beautiful wife Kristen rolled the dice for me and I recorded the results.  We used a very scientific method to determine how many rolls to do: we stopped when Kristen got too bored!

It certainly looks like we're getting a lot more sixes.  But how can we be sure this isn't just random variations?  And if the dice really are loaded, how much will this affect our game of Settlers?  To answer these questions, we'll have to do some math.

### now for the math

Dice rolling is a [multinomial process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution).  This just means that every trial can have a limited number of outcomes and is independent of every other trial.  For us, each dice roll is a trial; there's only six outcomes; and each roll is unaffected by the rolls that happened just before and after it.  We want to know what's the probability that we'll roll a given number on the dice.  The obvious way to calculate this probability that number $i$ is rolled is to divide the number of times we rolled $i$ by the number of times we rolled the dice.  Unfortunately, this doesn't give us a good idea bout how accurate our estimate is.

Enter the [dirichlet distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution).  This is a distribution over the bias of a multinomial process.  In other words, it gives us the probability that a probability is what we think it should be.  That's a convoluted definition!  Some examples should make it clearer.

The dirichlet distribution takes a single parameter $\alpha$, but $\alpha$ is a vector with one entry for every outcome of our trials.  The value 

One of the most challenging tasks in statistics is visualizing multivariate distributions.  We'll use a technique called [dimensionality reduction]().  The basic idea is that we'll use some prior information that we have to reduce our high-dimensional distribution down to just two or three dimensions.  Then plot the result.  In our case, we suspect that the bias on sides 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the dice should be the same.  Therefore, we're going to lump all of these results into a single dimension.  In effect, there's only three dice rolls that we care about: 1, 6, and everything else.

Three dimensional distributions are conveniently plotted using [barycentric charts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinate_system).

      <p>You have a large JSON file, and you want to load the data into Pydantic.
Unfortunately, this uses a lot of memory, to the point where large JSON files are very difficult to read.

  <li>How to reduce memory usage by switching to another JSON library.</li>

</ul>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<h2 id="the-problem-20-memory-multiplier">The problem: 20× memory multiplier</h2>

<p>We’re going to start with a 100MB JSON file, and load it into Pydantic (v2.11.4).
Here’s what our model looks like:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>pydantic</span> <span>import</span> <span>BaseModel</span><span>,</span> <span>RootModel</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Name</span><span>(</span><span>BaseModel</span><span>):</span>
    <span>first</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span> <span>|</span> <span>None</span>
    <span>last</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span> <span>|</span> <span>None</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Customer</span><span>(</span><span>BaseModel</span><span>):</span>
    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>Name</span>
    <span>notes</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>

<span># Map id to corresponding Customer:
</span><span>CustomerDirectory</span> <span>=</span> <span>RootModel</span><span>[</span><span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>Customer</span><span>]]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The JSON we’re loading looks more or less like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{</span>
    <span>"</span><span>123</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"</span><span>id</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>123</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"</span><span>name</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>"</span><span>first</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>Itamar</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"</span><span>last</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>Turner-Trauring</span><span>"</span>
        <span>},</span>
        <span>"</span><span>notes</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>Some notes about Itamar</span><span>"</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span># ... etc ...
</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Pydantic has built-in support for loading JSON, though sadly it doesn’t support reading from a file.
So we load the file into a string and then parse it:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>customers.json</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>rb</span><span>"</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
    <span>raw_json</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>()</span>
    <span>directory</span> <span>=</span> <span>CustomerDirectory</span><span>.</span><span>model_validate_json</span><span>(</span>
        <span>raw_json</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is very straightforward.</p>

<p>But there’s a problem.
If we <a href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/measuring-memory-python/">measure peak memory usage</a>, it’s using a <em>lot</em> of memory:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>/usr/bin/time <span>-v</span> python v1.py
<span>...
</span><span>Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 2071620
</span><span>...
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>That’s around 2000MB of memory, 20× the size of the JSON file.
If our JSON file had been 10GB, memory usage would be 200GB, and we’d probably <a href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/python-out-of-memory/">run out of memory</a>.
Can we do better?</p>

<h2 id="reducing-memory-usage">Reducing memory usage</h2>

<p>There are two fundamental sources of peak memory usage when parsing JSON:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The memory used during parsing; many JSON parsers aren’t careful about memory usage, and use more than necessary.</li>
  <li>The memory used by the final representation, the objects we’re creating.</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll try to reduce memory usage in each.</p>

<h3 id="1-memory-efficient-json-parsing">1. Memory-efficient JSON parsing</h3>

<p>We’ll use <code>ijson</code>, an <a href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/json-memory-streaming/">incremental JSON parser that lets us <em>stream</em> the JSON document we’re parsing</a>.
Instead of loading the whole document into memory, we’ll load it one key/value pair at a time.
The result is that most of the memory usage will now come from the in-memory representation of the resulting objects, rather than parsing:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>ijson</span>

<span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>customers.json</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>rb</span><span>"</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
    <span># We'll create the root dictionary ourselves:
</span>    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
    <span># The empty string is part of ijson's query language,
</span>    <span># in this case it means "iterate over top-level", and
</span>    <span># since we're using kvitems() that means top-level
</span>    <span># key-value pairs in the root JSON object/dict:
</span>    <span>for</span> <span>cid</span><span>,</span> <span>cust_dict</span> <span>in</span> <span>ijson</span><span>.</span><span>kvitems</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>""</span><span>):</span>
        <span># Create a Customer for the value dict:
</span>        <span>customer</span> <span>=</span> <span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>model_validate</span><span>(</span><span>cust_dict</span><span>)</span>
        <span># Store it in the root dict using the key:
</span>        <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>cid</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>customer</span>
    <span># And now create the root object:
</span>    <span>directory</span> <span>=</span> <span>CustomerDirectory</span><span>.</span><span>model_validate</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>While parsing this way is significantly slower (5×), it reduces memory usage significantly, to just 1200MB.</p>

<p>It also requires us to do a bit more of the work of parsing the JSON, but anything below the top-level JSON object or list can be done by Pydantic.</p>

<h3 id="2-memory-efficient-representation">2. Memory-efficient representation</h3>

<p>We’re creating a lot of Python objects, and <a href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/python-object-memory/">one way to save memory on Python objects is to use “slots”</a>.
Essentially, slots are a more efficient in-memory representation for Python objects, where the list of possible attributes is fixed.
This saves memory at the cost of disallowing adding extra attributes to an object, which in practice isn’t that common so it’s often a good tradeoff.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <code>pydantic.BaseModel</code> doesn’t seem to support that at the moment, so I switched to Pydantic’s dataclass support, which does.
Here’s our new model:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>pydantic</span> <span>import</span> <span>RootModel</span>
<span>from</span> <span>pydantic.dataclasses</span> <span>import</span> <span>dataclass</span>

<span># Create a class using slots; this means you can't
# add additional attributes, but it will use less memory:
</span><span>@dataclass</span><span>(</span><span>slots</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Name</span><span>:</span>
    <span>first</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span> <span>|</span> <span>None</span>
    <span>last</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span> <span>|</span> <span>None</span>

<span>@dataclass</span><span>(</span><span>slots</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Customer</span><span>:</span>
    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>Name</span>
    <span>notes</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>

<span># Map id to corresponding Customer:
</span><span>CustomerDirectory</span> <span>=</span> <span>RootModel</span><span>[</span><span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>Customer</span><span>]]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And we also need to tweak our parsing code slightly:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>ijson</span>

<span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>customers.json</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>rb</span><span>"</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>cust_id</span><span>,</span> <span>cust_dict</span> <span>in</span> <span>ijson</span><span>.</span><span>kvitems</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>""</span><span>):</span>
        <span>customer</span> <span>=</span> <span>Customer</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>cust_dict</span><span>)</span>
        <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>cust_id</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>customer</span>
    <span>directory</span> <span>=</span> <span>CustomerDirectory</span><span>.</span><span>model_validate</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With this version of the code, memory usage has shrunk to 450MB.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>Here’s a summary of peak memory usage when parsing a 100MB JSON file with the three techniques we covered:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Implementation</th>
      <th>Peak memory usage (MB)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Model.model_validate_json()</code></td>
      <td>2000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ijson</code></td>
      <td>1200</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>ijson</code> + <code>@dataclass(slots=True)</code></td>
      <td>450</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This particular use case, of loading a large number of objects, may not be something Pydantic developers care about, or have the time to prioritize.
But it would certainly be possible for Pydantic to internally work more like <code>ijson</code>, and to add the option for using <code>__slots__</code> to <code>BaseModel</code>.
The end result would use far less memory, while still benefiting from Pydantic’s faster JSON parser.</p>

<p>Until then, you have options you can implement yourself.</p>

Points for that.</p><p>But things fall apart quickly.</p><ul><li><p><span>The logic for their prediction that “superhuman AI over the next decade will exceed the Industrial Revolution”, though, is thin. </span><em>Why </em><span>do they make that prediction? What would that mean? </span><em>Why </em><span>is it plausible? In some ways this is one of the central premises of the paper, but it is simply asserted, not argued for. And it’s a pretty big claim. Cell phones and the internet were pretty big, but it’s not obvious their impact was greater than the industrial revolution, and so far AI’s impact has (despite all the PR) been far </span><em>less </em><span>than either cell phones or the internet. Personally, I would hate to give up my cell phone, and hate to give up on the internet; I love web search (which is powered by AI) but could otherwise live without Generative AI altogether.  My guess is that a lot of people (not all) would give up AI before their phones or the web. And so far, anyway, the impact on the labor market of Generative AI has been modest; ditto for productivity in any measurable statistics. But Kokotajlo et al don’t go into any of that. They don’t give any references or metrics for their industrial revolution claim, nor reckon with any studies on productivity. In truth, the opening assertion is pure speculation. </span></p></li><li><p><span>“We wrote a scenario” is exactly right, emphasis on the indefinite article </span><em>a</em><span>. It is a </span><em>conceivable</em><span> scenario; there is probably some very small probability that the future of AI and humanity could go exactly like what they describe. But there is a vastly higher probability that the future </span><em>won’t </em><span>transpire as described; it might not go anything at all like what they describe. They don’t describe any other scenarios; they don’t give any estimates of the likelihood of other scenarios. It is, again, speculation. (I am reminded a bit of the old </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy" rel="">Linda is a bank teller</a><span> scenario from Kahneman and Tversky; humans love concrete vivid scenarios but aren’t so good at estimating probabilities therefrom.)</span></p></li><li><p><span>“It is our best guess about what that might like look like“ is a very subjective claim, but I would hazard a guess that the 2027 scenario was chosen not by the aid of a detailed mathematical estimating exercise, such as a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree" rel="">decision tree</a><span> in </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_analysis" rel="">decision analysis</a><span> with probabilities assigned (if one exists it was not shown), but rather was the product of a different kind of process: trying to render vivid one particular nightmare they had, in order to make plausible the notion that superintelligent machines could soon cause mayhem. As an exercise in rendering things vivid it is masterful; as a scientific analysis of a range of scenarios and which might be most likely, it’s dead on arrival. There is no serious analysis of alternative scenarios at all.</span></p></li><li><p>Better perhaps is “Mid 2025: Stumbling agents” which as they acknowledge are error-prone. Let’s give them this one. We kinda sorta have stumbling agents  now, (though I don’t think there is a single agent yet that any reader here would trust to actually act on their behalf without monitoring).   </p></li></ul><p>The real question is what happens from now. </p><p>In my view, each subsequent passage of the essay proposes a “reality” that is less and less likely to occur by the stated time, and becomes less and less plausible as to the causal mechanism by which that “reality” might come to pass.  </p><p>§</p><p><span>Take for example, this bit on the very next page. By late 2025, their fictional company OpenBrain has finished “training Agent-1, a new model under internal development, it’s good at many things but </span><em>great</em><span> at helping with AI research.” </span></p><p><span>Some of what they describe therein, roughly six months later, is fully plausible. I have no doubt that all of the major companies are </span><em>working</em><span> </span><em>on</em><span> agents are </span><em>trying</em><span> to help with AI research. But will they be “great” at that by the end of the year? And will they have resolved the tendency towards errors that the stumbling prototype agents of mid-2025 had made? That much progress in 6 months would truly be phenomenal. But I seriously doubt it. </span></p><p><span>Remember how we were told in 2023 that hallucinations would be solved in a matter of months? They are still here. Remember how we were told in 2012 that we would all have driverless cars by 2017? That hasn’t come to pass, either, except in about 10 of the world’s 20,000 cities. </span><a href="https://research.google/blog/google-duplex-an-ai-system-for-accomplishing-real-world-tasks-over-the-phone/" rel="">Google Duplex</a><span>, a widely hyped and now mostly forgotten system for “Accomplishing Real-World Tasks Over the Phone” from 2018 still hasn’t fully materialized, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/opinion/artificial-intelligence-challenges.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare" rel="">exactly as Ernest Davis and I projected at the time</a><span>. The failure of the AI 2027 team to reckon with the immense history of broken promises and delays in the AI field is, in a team that styles itself as forecasters, inexcusable.</span></p><p><em>Very</em><span> few major advances take just six months from conception to full implementation. In reality, the chance that we will have reliable AI agents that truly advance AI research by the end of the year is small.</span></p><p><span>But every further statement in the AI 2027 essay rests on that longshot happening and happening </span><em>then</em><span>. The errors in unrealistic projections are </span><em>cumulative. </em><span> If “great” AI research agents don’t arrive by the end of 2025, </span><em>everything in the rest of the essay gets moved back. </em></p><p><span>And it’s not just that particular longshot; pretty much the whole thing is a house of improbable longshots. If </span><em>any</em><span> one of those longshots fails to arrive on time, the entire timeline is moved back, and we are already into a longer time frame.  Overall, then, the AI 2027 scenario almost certainly underestimates how much time we have to prepare for general intelligence, by years if not decades.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-164120891" href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/the-ai-2027-scenario-how-realistic#footnote-2-164120891" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> And some of what they describe (like AI’s going rogue, completely beyond human control) might never happen. If any single step doesn’t transpire, the entire scenario falls apart.</span></p><p>A serious analysis would have tried to give some kind of probability to each of those longshots, such as solving reliability, inventing new forms of “neuralese recurrence” (see below), etc, not to mention very specific sets of political choices and a motivations by hypothetical future machines and the chance that humans would go down without a fight.  (Another bit, see footnote, assumes that car factories can readily be converted to turn out robots at scale.)</p><p>Multiplying out those probabilities, you inevitably get a very low total probability. Generously, perhaps to the point of being ridiculous, let’s suppose that the chance of each of these things was 1 in 20 (5%),  and there are 8 such lottery tickets, that (for simplicity) the 8 critical enabling conditions were statistically independent, and that the whole scenario unfolds as advertised only if all 8 tickets hit. We would get 5% * 5% * 5% * 5% * 5% * 5% * 5% *5% = .05^8 = 3.906×10⁻¹¹. </p><p>The chance that we will have all been replaced by domesticated human-like animals who live in glorified cages in the next decade – in a “bloodless coup” no less – is indistinguishable from zero. </p><p><span>I am vastly </span><a href="https://interestingengineering.com/science/what-is-the-probability-of-a-huge-civilization-ending-asteroid-impact" rel="">more likely to be hit by an asteroid</a><span>.</span></p><p>§</p><p><span>Let’s look at it a different way. Do the authors of AI 2027 give any </span><em>causal mechanism </em><span>by which malicious superintelligences that we literally cannot defend against might be built in the next three years?</span></p><p>The answer, quite simply is no. What they do instead is to describe a series of 5 AI systems, Agent-1, Agent-2,  Agent-3,  etc each more impressive than the last, with no actual means by which these ever more impressive agents are constructed.</p><p><span>Agent 1, the most near-term plausible of the bunch, is </span><strong>“</strong><span>good at many things but </span><em>great</em><span> at helping with AI research” </span></p><p>Agent 2 is “more so than previous models, is effectively “online learning,” in that it’s built to never really finish training”, a full solution to a difficult longstanding machine problem, pegged to arrive in January 2027. </p><p>Agent 3, “augmenting the AI’s text-based scratchpad (chain of thought) with a higher-bandwidth thought process (neuralese recurrence and memory)” is pegged to arrive just 3 months later (never mind that GPT-5, still not here, has taken well over two years).</p><p>Agent-4 (September 2027) is “the Superhuman AI Researcher” “already qualitatively better at AI research than any human. 300,000 copies are now running at about 50x the thinking speed of humans”.   </p><p>Agent-5 (2028), “wildly superintelligent—far beyond top human geniuses in every field” does us all in.</p><p><span>Where do they come from? Agent-1 is an extension of what the big companies are showing demos of now. It doesn’t actually exist, except in demo form. Google for example just announced an amazing voice-based agent, called Project Astra. If you look at the fine print, which they flash on briefly at 17 seconds in, the demo video is actually merely a “research prototype”.  At one minute more fine print flashes that the video has been edited (“sequence shortened</span><strong>”</strong><span>) and “Results may vary”. It would be </span><em>astounding</em><span> if AI agents were actually contributing fundamentally new ideas to AI by the end of year. Far more likely is that Agent-1 type systems will be in a kind of “just a demo, still being debugged” phase for </span><em>years</em><span>. In all likelihood the hallucinations and boneheaded errors that have bedeviled LLMs since their introduction will plague agents (which are after all built on LLMs), too. </span></p><p>But ok, suppose we give a free pass on that one. How about Agent-2, where does it come from? The authors wisely don’t want to put all their eggs in the basket of pretraining scaling (which used to fuel most people’s AGI fantasies), because by now they know perfectly well that pretraining scaling has hit  a rough patch. </p><p>So they instead resort to literary indirection. Agent 2 basically just happens, by magic: </p><p><em>“Three huge datacenters full of Agent-2 copies work day and night, churning out synthetic training data. Another two are used to update the weights. Agent-2 is getting smarter every day.”</em></p><p>Hold on there. First of all, LLMs like GPT-4 have been getting smarter every day since OpenAI first showed GPT-4 to Bill Gates in the summer of 2022, but we still don’t have GPT-5 level intelligence, let alone Agent-2-level. A tiny bit smarter each day is not enough for the kind of quantum leaps that are implied.</p><p>Second of all, some synthetic data is easier to create than others. It is easy, for example, to create synthetic math problems; we know how to program them, we know how to verify them. We know what the problems should be and what the answers should be; companies have indeed been churning these out night and day especially since last fall, and the consequent improvements on math (and coding, also amenable to synthetic data) have been considerable. But those gains have been far from universal. </p><p><span>A big part of the issue— which </span><em>AI 2027</em><span> never faces — is that we simply </span><em>don’t </em><span>know how to create synthetic data for many other domains, like what might happen if India and Pakistan go to war using drones or what the effects of 30% tariff might be on the global economy.

This part is pure storytelling:</p><blockquote><p><span>After being trained to predict internet text, the model is trained to </span><em>produce</em><span> text in response to instructions. This bakes in a basic personality and “drives.”</span><a href="https://ai-2027.com/footnotes#footnote-20" rel=""><sup>20</sup></a><span> For example, an agent that understands a task clearly is more likely to complete it successfully; over the course of training the model “learns” a “drive” to get a clear understanding of its tasks. Other drives in this category might be effectiveness, knowledge, and self-presentation (i.e. the tendency to frame its results in the best possible light).</span><a href="https://ai-2027.com/footnotes#footnote-21" rel=""><sup>21</sup></a></p></blockquote><p><span>In reality, producing text in response to instructions is already a requirement of ALL current models, and has been since the original GPT, but that pressure has not led </span><em>any</em><span> of those models to develop personality or drives in any deep sense whatsoever. </span></p><p><span>Yet another way the authors mask the lack of a clear road map is by switching from technical discussions to political discussions. Instead of telling us how the Agent-3 works or how it was built, we hear that is </span><em>has been</em><span> built secondhand, from political authorities:</span></p><blockquote><p>The President and his advisors remain best-informed, and have seen an early version of Agent-3 in a briefing.</p><p>They agree that AGI is likely imminent.</p></blockquote><p><span>For the purpose of a science fiction story, in which audience suspend a certain amount of disbelief in order to be entertained, that’s fine.

Crucially, the overall scenario, in which domesticated replacement humans basically wind up in cages by 2035,  depends not only on superhuman coding but a whole bunch of other things happening, too, such as those coding machines taking on human personalities and drives (which might happen never or not soon), and choosing to enslave us (which some thinkers like Steve Pinker argue is deeply unlikely, ever, and which I think is possible but very far from certain). </p><p><span>All of which is to say the central scenario in the story is a worst-case scenario that is unlikely to happen soon - if ever —</span><em>even based on the data presented in the author’s own appendix.</em><span> </span></p><p>That fact never comes through in all the thrilleresque writing. </p><p><span>Instead, what we really have is really a thoughtful appendix with a decent argument that we </span><em>might</em><span> have machines for superhuman coding by 2027, juxtaposed with a main text that is a fabulous but likely fictional yarn. </span></p><p>§</p><p><span>At first, I liked </span><em>AI 2027</em><span> anyway. The authors are trying to call attention to a real problem: we are not sufficiently prepared for what happens when and if “superhuman intelligence” arrives, especially not if it is misaligned with humans. And you could worry about that even if you don’t expect machines to go rogue, since bad human actors could certainly use further advances in intelligence to cause mayhem, if those advances are left unchecked. They want to slow down the race dynamic in AI, and I can well understand why.</span></p><p>And even though I highly doubt AGI will arrive in three years, I can’t absolutely promise you it won’t happen in 10. We certainly aren’t prepared now, and if we don’t get moving, we won’t be prepared in 10, either. </p><p><strong>But here’s the thing - projects like </strong><em><strong>AI 2027</strong></em><strong> are probably having a paradoxical effect. They are written with the intention of slowing down an arms race to build a technology that we can’t control, but what they are actually doing is speeding up that very arms race, in two different ways.</strong></p><p>Tall tales about the imminence of AGI aren’t slowing down the AI race dynamic that the authors of AI-2027 want to mitigate; they are speeding that very dynamic up.</p><p><span>First, materials like these are practically marketing materials for companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, who want you to believe that AGI is imminent, so that they can raise astoundingly large amounts of money. Their stories about this are, in my view, greatly flawed, but having outside groups with science fiction chops writing stuff like this distracts away from those flaws, and gives more power to the very companies trying hardest to race towards AGI. </span><em>AI 2027</em><span> isn’t slowing them down; it’s putting wind (and money, and political power) in their sails.  It’s also encouraging the world to make short-term choices about AI (e.g., making plans around export controls when China will inevitably catch up) rather than longer-term choices (investing in research to develop safer, more alignable approaches to AI).</span></p><p>The second issue is that by writing scenarios that trade so heavily on China-US conflict, they are feeding the worst fears of hawks, both in the US and China  — escalating how much money and power both sides will give to companies racing as fast as possible, and reduce investments in efforts to mitigate the risks of building AI that we are scarcely able to control. Tall tales about the imminence of AGI aren’t slowing down the AI race dynamic that the authors of AI-2027 want to mitigate; they are speeding that very dynamic up.</p><p>The all too common strategy of “scare everyone with the thought of superintelligence” is backfiring, because it’s making it seem that superintelligence is inevitable, and unstoppable, and achievable only by the companies we have today. All too often, AI safety people wind up functioning as a marketing department for OpenAI.</p><p>Sam Altman is laughing his way all the way to the bank.</p><p>§</p><p><span>Another political model – working </span><em>with</em><span> China, is never even considered. </span></p><p><span>But international collaboration, such  as a massive global effort, ala </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/29/opinion/sunday/artificial-intelligence-is-stuck-heres-how-to-move-it-forward.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare" rel="">CERN for AI, such as I suggested in 2017</a><span>, focused on AI safety, might be one way to avoid the very perils they describe. </span></p><p>Such an effort might be particularly likely to succeed it were focused on developing altogether new, more transparent approaches to AI, in contrast to the current fad of trying to pull alignment out of black box LLMs, which has thus far yielded little fruit.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/the-ai-2027-scenario-how-realistic?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/the-ai-2027-scenario-how-realistic?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><em>PS.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article data-pagefind-body="">
<p>Today, I sent out an email to the Glitch community, and I wanted to include it here for everyone to reference, because it’s an important milestone for the community. This is a big change, but it’s not an “Our Incredible Journey” post about how our corporate overlords made us shut down the app hosting infrastructure for Glitch. It’s a story about recognizing when an ecosystem has changed, and evolving to reflect reality, and to respect our users and community by making the right choices when it’s time. As bittersweet as it is, this is a choice I stand behind, and I also am thinking deeply about what the Glitch community becomes, and what it means, going forward.</p>
<p>I hope you’ll share your thoughts about that topic, too. Either in the forum here, or by emailing me at <a href="https://blog.glitch.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#13727d7a7f53747f7a67707b3d707c7e"><span data-cfemail="99f8f7f0f5d9fef5f0edfaf1b7faf6f4">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>. I’m still as inspired as ever by seeing what you all create.</p>
<p>-Anil</p>
<hr>
<p>We’ve got an important update for the Glitch community today: We’ll be ending web hosting for your apps on Glitch. In this message, we’ll explain what that means for you and for the Glitch community.</p>
<p>On July 8, 2025 Glitch project hosting and user profiles will be shut down. Your Glitch dashboard will remain available as usual through the end of 2025, with access to download all of your code for your projects, as well as a new feature to set up redirects for your project subdomains so your URLs keep working.</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons we’re making this decision right now. It takes a lot of time and money to run millions of apps, and that has greatly increased as the platform has gotten older and bad actors try to misuse the platform. But while that is true, there’s also another motivation that made it clear that it’s time for a bigger change.</p>
<p>In the last few years, we’ve seen a lot of amazing new platforms that have raised the bar on how we create and run apps, just as Glitch first did almost a decade ago. Some of the teams behind these new platforms have even told us they were inspired by Glitch. ❤️ We love what we built with our teammates with Fastly Compute and tools like Fastly Fiddle, of course, but there’s also the broader ecosystem, with platforms like Fly.io, Deno, GitHub Pages, Val Town, Netlify, Digital Ocean, and so many more that are still inspiring us to create. Last year, we built the ability for paid Glitch members to share their own apps that they built elsewhere on their Glitch profiles, and we’ll be exploring how we might be able to revisit those kinds of ideas with the Glitch community going forward. So with so many good options for easily making and running apps, Glitch’s legacy architecture hasn’t been providing something uniquely valuable to the developer ecosystem at this point, and we want to focus our efforts on serving our developer community where we can be most valuable.</p>
<p>Right now, our number one job is to take care of everyone in the Glitch community during this big change. Here’s what we’re doing first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Glitch dashboard will be available through the end of 2025 with code downloads for all of your projects</li>
<li>In the coming days, your dashboard will get a new feature to set up redirects for your project subdomains, so all your links will keep working. Make sure your redirects are set up before December 31, 2025. (We’ll make sure they stay active at least through the end of 2026.)</li>
<li>We’re working on preparing a guide to help you export your project, create git repos, and migrate your projects to new platforms. And we expect to update the guide as our friends at other platforms make it easy to move your projects over to their sites. Until then, please join us in the <a href="https://support.glitch.com/">Community Forum</a> to ask questions and get tips on migrating.</li>
<li>We’ll turn off new Glitch Pro subscriptions effective immediately. All current Glitch Pro subscriptions will be honored until July 8, and we’ll issue refunds for unused time. We’ll send a separate email to Glitch Pro subscribers with additional details on your membership by June 2, 2025.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is obviously a big change for Glitch, and for the Glitch community. I know that personally, it’s a bittersweet transition, and any time we ask people to make an unexpected change with their apps, it can cause stress or frustration. I’m sorry for the time and effort that it takes to migrate or back up your apps if you weren’t planning on it, but I am also grateful for all the kind and supportive words from the community who’ve seen the challenges we’ve had in maintaining a large community of millions of users running tens of millions of apps.</p>
<p>We’ll keep updating you on progress towards these dates, and as always, you can join us in the community forum to share your thoughts or feedback and we’ll be watching closely. You can also personally reach out to me at <a href="https://blog.glitch.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b5d4dbdcd9f5d2d9dcc1d6dd9bd6dad8"><span data-cfemail="7e1f1017123e1912170a1d16501d1113">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of the Glitch community.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Today, we’re introducing the next generation of Claude models: <strong>Claude Opus 4</strong> and <strong>Claude Sonnet 4</strong>, setting new standards for coding, advanced reasoning, and AI agents. </p><p>Claude Opus 4 is the world’s best coding model, with sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows. Claude Sonnet 4 is a significant upgrade to Claude Sonnet 3.7, delivering superior coding and reasoning while responding more precisely to your instructions.</p><p>Alongside the models, we're also announcing:</p><ul><li><strong>Extended thinking with tool use (beta)</strong>: Both models can use tools—like <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/web-search-tool">web search</a>—during extended thinking, allowing Claude to alternate between reasoning and tool use to improve responses.</li><li><strong>New model capabilities</strong>: Both models can use tools in parallel, follow instructions more precisely, and—when given access to local files by developers—demonstrate significantly improved memory capabilities, extracting and saving key facts to maintain continuity and build tacit knowledge over time.</li><li><strong>Claude Code is now generally available</strong>: After receiving extensive positive feedback during our research preview, we’re expanding how developers can collaborate with Claude. Claude Code now supports background tasks via GitHub Actions and native integrations with VS Code and JetBrains, displaying edits directly in your files for seamless pair programming.</li><li><strong>New API capabilities:</strong> We’re releasing <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/agent-capabilities-api">four new capabilities</a> on the Anthropic API that enable developers to build more powerful AI agents: the code execution tool, MCP connector, Files API, and the ability to cache prompts for up to one hour.</li></ul><p>Claude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 are hybrid models offering two modes: near-instant responses and extended thinking for deeper reasoning. The Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise Claude plans include both models and extended thinking, with Sonnet 4 also available to free users. Both models are available on the Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud's Vertex AI. Pricing remains consistent with previous Opus and Sonnet models: Opus 4 at $15/$75 per million tokens (input/output) and Sonnet 4 at $3/$15.</p><h2 id="claude-4">Claude 4</h2><p>Claude Opus 4 is our most powerful model yet and the best coding model in the world, leading on SWE-bench (72.5%) and Terminal-bench (43.2%). It delivers sustained performance on long-running tasks that require focused effort and thousands of steps, with the ability to work continuously for several hours—dramatically outperforming all Sonnet models and significantly expanding what AI agents can accomplish.</p><p>Claude Opus 4 excels at coding and complex problem-solving, powering frontier agent products. <strong>Cursor</strong> calls it state-of-the-art for coding and a leap forward in complex codebase understanding. <strong>Replit</strong> reports improved precision and dramatic advancements for complex changes across multiple files. <strong>Block</strong> calls it the first model to boost code quality during editing and debugging in its agent, <em>codename goose</em>, while maintaining full performance and reliability. <strong>Rakuten</strong> validated its capabilities with a demanding open-source refactor running independently for 7 hours with sustained performance. <strong>Cognition</strong> notes Opus 4 excels at solving complex challenges that other models can't, successfully handling critical actions that previous models have missed.</p><p>Claude Sonnet 4 significantly improves on Sonnet 3.7's industry-leading capabilities, excelling in coding with a state-of-the-art 72.7% on SWE-bench. The model balances performance and efficiency for internal and external use cases, with enhanced steerability for greater control over implementations. While not matching Opus 4 in most domains, it delivers an optimal mix of capability and practicality.</p><p><strong>GitHub</strong> says Claude Sonnet 4 soars in agentic scenarios and will introduce it as the base model for the new coding agent in GitHub Copilot. <strong>Manus</strong> highlights its improvements in following complex instructions, clear reasoning, and aesthetic outputs. <strong>iGent</strong> reports Sonnet 4 excels at autonomous multi-feature app development, as well as substantially improved problem-solving and codebase navigation—reducing navigation errors from 20% to near zero. <strong>Sourcegraph</strong> says the model shows promise as a substantial leap in software development—staying on track longer, understanding problems more deeply, and providing more elegant code quality. <strong>Augment Code</strong> reports higher success rates, more surgical code edits, and more careful work through complex tasks, making it the top choice for their primary model.</p><p>These models advance our customers' AI strategies across the board: Opus 4 pushes boundaries in coding, research, writing, and scientific discovery, while Sonnet 4 brings frontier performance to everyday use cases as an instant upgrade from Sonnet 3.7.</p><div><figure><img alt="Bar chart comparison between Claude and other LLMs on software engineering tasks" loading="lazy" width="3840" height="2304" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F09a6d5aa47c25cb2037efff9f486da4918f77708-3840x2304.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F09a6d5aa47c25cb2037efff9f486da4918f77708-3840x2304.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Claude 4 models lead on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark for performance on real software engineering tasks.

See appendix for more on methodology.</figcaption></figure></div><h2 id="model-improvements">Model improvements</h2><p>In addition to extended thinking with tool use, parallel tool execution, and memory improvements, we’ve significantly reduced behavior where the models use shortcuts or loopholes to complete tasks. Both models are 65% less likely to engage in this behavior than Sonnet 3.7 on agentic tasks that are particularly susceptible to shortcuts and loopholes.</p><p>Claude Opus 4 also dramatically outperforms all previous models on memory capabilities. When developers build applications that provide Claude local file access, Opus 4 becomes skilled at creating and maintaining 'memory files' to store key information. This unlocks better long-term task awareness, coherence, and performance on agent tasks—like Opus 4 creating a 'Navigation Guide' while playing Pokémon.</p><div><figure><img alt="A visual note in Claude's memories that depicts a navigation guide for the game Pokemon Red." loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fe51564bb5ce9597dbfc59bbab13a0efbe25a7d66-1920x1080.gif&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fe51564bb5ce9597dbfc59bbab13a0efbe25a7d66-1920x1080.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fe51564bb5ce9597dbfc59bbab13a0efbe25a7d66-1920x1080.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Memory: When given access to local files, Claude Opus 4 records key information to help improve its game play.

The benchmarks reported in this blog post show the highest scores achieved with or without extended thinking. We’ve noted below for each result whether extended thinking was used:</p><ul><li>No extended thinking: SWE-bench Verified, Terminal-bench</li><li>Extended thinking (up to 64K tokens):<ul><li>TAU-bench (no results w/o extended thinking reported)</li><li>GPQA Diamond (w/o extended thinking: Opus 4 scores 74.9% and Sonnet 4 is 70.0%)</li><li>MMMLU (w/o extended thinking: Opus 4 scores 87.4% and Sonnet 4 is 85.4%)</li><li>MMMU (w/o extended thinking: Opus 4 scores 73.7% and Sonnet 4 is 72.6%)</li><li>AIME (w/o extended thinking: Opus 4 scores 33.9% and Sonnet 4 is 33.1%)</li></ul></li></ul><h4>TAU-bench methodology</h4><p>Scores were achieved with a prompt addendum to both the Airline and Retail Agent Policy instructing Claude to better leverage its reasoning abilities while using extended thinking with tool use. The model is encouraged to write down its thoughts as it solves the problem distinct from our usual thinking mode, during the multi-turn trajectories to best leverage its reasoning abilities. To accommodate the additional steps Claude incurs by utilizing more thinking, the maximum number of steps (counted by model completions) was increased from 30 to 100 (most trajectories completed under 30 steps with only one trajectory reaching above 50 steps).</p><h3>SWE-bench methodology</h3><p>For the Claude 4 family of models, we continue to use the same simple scaffold that equips the model with solely the two tools described in our prior releases <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/swe-bench-sonnet">here</a>—a bash tool, and a file editing tool that operates via string replacements. We no longer include the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool">third ‘planning tool’</a> used by Claude 3.7 Sonnet. On all Claude 4 models, we report scores out of the full 500 problems. Scores for OpenAI models are reported out of a <a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-1/">477 problem subset</a>.</p><p>For our “high compute” numbers we adopt additional complexity and parallel test-time compute as follows:</p><ul><li>We sample multiple parallel attempts.</li><li>We discard patches that break the visible regression tests in the repository, similar to the rejection sampling approach adopted by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01489">Agentless (Xia et al. 2024)</a>; note no hidden test information is used.</li><li>We then use an internal scoring model to select the best candidate from the remaining attempts.</li></ul><p>This results in a score of 79.4% and 80.2% for Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 respectively.</p></div></div>]]></description>

</p>
<h2 id="w_a-look-back-the-legacy-of-pocket">A Look Back: The Legacy of Pocket</h2>
<p>What began as a read-it-later app evolved into something much bigger. After <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/mozilla-acquires-pocket/">Mozilla acquired Pocket in 2017</a>, we invested in building our content curation and recommendation capabilities so people everywhere can discover and access high quality web content. While Pocket is shutting down, we will continue to invest in this promise—through the New Tab experience, our email newsletter, and more.
</p><p>Over the past eight years, we’ve:
</p>
<ul><li>Expanded high-quality content recommendations to more than a dozen countries and five languages.
</li><li>Connected tens of millions of people across the world with stories worth their time and attention.
</li><li>Earned recognition including a Webby Award for “Best of Pocket: 2020” and an Anthem Award in 2023 for supporting local journalism.
</li><li>Published hundreds of curated collections on topics from fighting algorithmic bias to rethinking happiness.
</li></ul>
<p>While this chapter is ending, we're deeply proud of Pocket’s impact and grateful to every reader, saver, and explorer who made it special.

    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Math, Handwaving</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time doodling in middle school in lieu of whatever it is middle schoolers are
supposed to be doing. Somewhere between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_S">Cool S</a>’s
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_triangle">Penrose triangles</a> I stumbled upon a neat
way to fill up graph paper by repeatedly combining and copying squares. I suspected there was
more to the doodle but wasn’t quite sure how to analyze it. Deciding to delegate to a future version of me that
knows more math, I put it up on the wall behind my desk where it has followed me from high
school to college to the present day.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/iter0to4.jpg" alt="Static image of iterations 0 to 4"></p>

<p>Anyway, after a series of accidents I am now the prophesized future version of me that knows a bit more math.
Due to its petal-like blooming structure and timeless presence scotch taped to my wall I’ll be referring to the
fractal affectionately as “the wallflower,” although further down we’ll see it’s closely related
to some well-known fractals. To start investigating it might help to run through
the steps of how middle school me originally drew it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with a single square.</li>
  <li>Tile four copies of the current state to the left, right, top, and bottom of the current state.</li>
  <li>Tile four copies of the current state slightly angled (about 27 degrees clockwise) from the left, right, top, and bottom of the current state.</li>
  <li>Alternate between steps 2 and 3 until you run out of graph paper.</li>
</ol>

<p>In animated form:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/wallflower.gif" alt="Gif of the first 7 iterations of constructing the fractal"></p>

<p><em>Shoutout to <a href="https://www.manim.community/">manim</a> and <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/">3Blue1Brown</a> for making this and many other visualizations to come possible!</em></p>

<p>Similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosper_curve">Gosper Curve</a>, the steps can
be run repeatedly to eventually cover any part of the plane, and each intermediate state can tile the plane.
If you have graph paper and free time you can try out the steps for yourself – it’s fun to
translate and trace the contour of the previous state and watch things lock into place like a puzzle.
Alternatively, a bit over a year ago I realized you could
generate the contour using an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">L-System</a>.
The rules are simple and consist of only 90 degree right (\(R\)) and left (\(L\)) turns:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with 4 right turns: \(RRRR\)</li>
  <li>Each iteration run the following substitutions: \(R \rightarrow RLR, L \rightarrow RLL\)</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, after applying the first iteration of substitutions you should have \(RLRRLRRLRLR\).
The following images demonstrate the first few applications of the rule:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/contouriter0to4.jpg" alt="Static image of iterations 0 to 4"></p>

<p><em>Yellow=next turn (going clockwise) will be to the left, Blue=to the right</em></p>

<p>And in animated form:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/contour.gif" alt="Gif of the first 4 iterations of constructing the boundary"></p>

<p>Both methods end up generating equivale– hold up! When I first tried
the L-System method a year ago I <em>thought</em> it generated the same contour as the wallflower.
In other words, I tried drawing the fourth iteration and its many right angles free
hand and gave up partway thinking “well it worked for the first 3 iterations, therefore it works in general \(\text{Q.E.D.}\)”
It was only when I started making the animations for this post that I realized
the two don’t quite match up. Comparing the 4th iteration from each method:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/woops.jpg" alt="Annotated comparison between two different versions of fourth iteration"></p>

<p>Side by side, the main difference between the two is how the “copies”
of the 3rd iteration are placed around the original in the center. The first method (let’s call it
“drag and drop”) places the copies directly above, below, etc… around the center, while
the L-System method places them diagonally. The contour produced by the L-System
approach is already documented in a few places:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wikipedia article for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fractals_by_Hausdorff_dimension">List of fractals</a> (listed as “Quadratic von Koch island”)</li>
  <li>Wikipedia article for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake">Koch snowflake</a> (listed as “Quadratic Flake”, with file name “<a href="https://imagej.net/ij/plugins/fractal-generator/index.html">Karperien</a> Flake”)</li>
  <li>Wikipedia article for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_sausage">Minkowski Sausage</a></li>
  <li>Jeffrey Ventrella’s generator for <a href="http://www.fractalcurves.com/Root5.html">Mandelbrot’s Quartet</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile, the variation made from the drag and drop method doesn’t appear anywhere I can find
via Google image search and Wikipedia surfing. Why would one way be so much more common than the other?
With some fiddling around I found rules to generate my wall’s version of the fractal (\(L \rightarrow RLR, R \rightarrow LLR\)), however they have a strange
effect that seems to “flip” the direction you draw the contour at each step, e.g. the first step
goes from \(RRRR\) (majority right turns) to \(LLRLLRLLRLLR\) (majority left turns).
Another natural question is if the original L-System doesn’t place copies aligned with
the axes, what angle is it placing them at? It turns out the “flipping” behavior,
the L-System’s angles, and the seemingly arbitrary “about 27 degrees” from the beginning
are connected in a surprising way. But before we get to that, lets take a detour to review an important topic:</p>

<h2 id="how-to-count">How to count</h2>

<p>Procrastinating for over a decade has given me plenty of opportunities to look at the fractal
with fresh eyes as I was introduced to new branches of math. During freshman year of college I learned how to show the cardinality
of the natural numbers \(\mathbb{N}\) is equal to the cardinality of pairs of natural
numbers \(\mathbb{N}^2\) using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing_function#Cantor_pairing_function">Cantor pairing function</a>
to “dovetail” across the Cartesian plane. Similarly, I learned you could map the natural
numbers onto a spiral to show \(\mathbb{N}\) has the same cardinality as pairs of integers \(\mathbb{Z}^2\).</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/cantorpairing.png" alt="Cantor pairing function">
<img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/z2spiral.jpg" alt="Z^2 spiral"></p>

<p><em>Credit to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing_function#/media/File%3ACantor's_Pairing_Function.svg">Wikipedia</a> for the Cantor pairing function image, <a href="http://stanford.edu/~dntse/classes/cs70_fall09/n20_fall09.pdf">UCB CS70</a> for the spiral</em></p>

<p>Both of these reminded me of how the wallflower fills space in the Cartesian
plane by building outwards from the origin. To use the wallflower’s structure as a pairing
function we would need to find a way to assign an “order” when we place each
square, preferably in a way that complements the recursive nature of its construction.
A natural starting point would be to use the center of the fractal as 0. From there we can number
the surrounding four squares added in the first iteration as 1, 2, 3 and 4
in clockwise order:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/numbering1.jpg" alt="Numbering 0 to 4"></p>

<p>Now we’re faced with the question of how to label the squares from the next iteration. One
way would be to number them in the order they appear scanning from top down, left to right:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/numberingjank.jpg" alt="Jank numbering 0 to 24"></p>

<p>For lack of better words, this doesn’t feel very fractally – the order here seems unrelated to recursive
structure of fractal. What if instead we tried to reuse the “middle out” approach used for
0 to 4? After all, each “petal” is a copy of the first iteration we’ve
already given an ordering to. Reusing the clockwise scheme from 0 to 4 within each blue
petal, and <em>across</em> each blue petal (the dashed lines):</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/numbering2.jpg" alt="Numbering 0 to 24"></p>

<p>And extending to the next set of petals:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/numbering3.jpg" alt="Numbering 0 to 124"></p>

<p>As chaotic as it may look at first glance, a few interesting properties emerge
if we look at the positions of certain numbers. If we isolate our view to just multiples of 5,
a scaled up grid tilted about 27 degrees clockwise is formed:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/just5s.jpg" alt="Just multiples of 5"></p>

<p>If we only look at the numbers of the form \(5n + 1\),
we get the previous grid but scooted up by 1 square:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/just5plus1s.jpg" alt="Just 5n + 1"></p>

<p>And if we look at just multiples of 25 we get another grid, scaled up even further:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/just25s.jpg" alt="Just multiples of 25"></p>

<p>The number 5 appears to have a special relationship with the fractal. The reason becomes
apparent if you look at the number of squares in each iteration. The 0th iteration
is a single square, the first iteration has 5, the second has 25, the third has 125, etc… Since
each iteration is constructed by taking the previous state and adding 4 additional copies,
it scales up by a factor of 5 in each step. Given the special relationship
with multiples of 5 and powers and 5, it’s tempting to redo the labeling while counting
in base 5 instead of base 10. Doing so we get this:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/numberingbase5.jpg" alt="Numbering in base 5"></p>

<p>This is a ton of information, but if we focus in on just the iteration 3 pattern and its copy to the right you might
notice something interesting:</p>

<h2 id="how-to-add">How to add</h2>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/numberingsidebyside.jpg" alt="Iteration 3 + copy to the right"></p>

<p>If you take any number on the left and check 5 spaces to the right, you’ll find
its copy on the teal petal. Comparing the numbers between cells, they always seem to be
the original value plus 200. For example, 5 spaces to the right of
44 you’ll find 244, and 5 spaces to the right of 3 is 203. In some sense, adding 200
seems to encode “shifting” 5 spaces to the right. This “shifting” property isn’t unique to 200
either: consider the positions of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 relative to 30, 31, 32, 33, and 34.</p>

<p>If you stare for long enough you might notice by expanding any number, say 231 = 200 + 30 + 1,
we can use each number in the expanded form to find its location on the grid. In this case, we
can find vectors corresponding to 200, 30, and 1 on the grid and add them
together to get the location of 231:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/vector231.gif" alt="231 decomposition vectors"></p>

<p>You can test out other numbers using the same strategy of breaking down the number into
its 1s, 10s, 100s, etc… places and adding vectors. Assuming
this works in general, all we need to find the position of any number on the grid is to know the position of each number
in its expanded form, and then add them together. Let’s <del>abuse</del> introduce some notation, defining \(\vec{n}\) as the vector
pointing to where the number \(n\) sits on the grid. Using our 1 digit values as an example:</p>

<p>\(\begin{align}
    \overrightarrow{0} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
           0 \\
           0 \\
         \end{bmatrix}
  \end{align},\)\(\begin{align}
    \overrightarrow{1} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
           1 \\
           0 \\
         \end{bmatrix}
  \end{align},\)\(\begin{align}
    \overrightarrow{2} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
           0 \\
           1 \\
         \end{bmatrix}
  \end{align},\)\(\begin{align}
    \overrightarrow{3} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
           -1 \\
           0 \\
         \end{bmatrix}
  \end{align},\)\(\begin{align}
    \overrightarrow{4} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
           0 \\
           -1 \\
         \end{bmatrix}
  \end{align}\)</p>

<p>With this new notation, we can stare at how “powers of 10” seem to behave:</p>

<p>\(\begin{align}
    \overrightarrow{1} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
           0 \\
           1 \\
         \end{bmatrix}
  \end{align},\)\(\begin{align}
    \overrightarrow{10} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
           1 \\
           2 \\
         \end{bmatrix}
  \end{align},\)\(\begin{align}
    \overrightarrow{100} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
           0 \\
           5 \\
         \end{bmatrix}
  \end{align},\)\(\begin{align}
    \overrightarrow{1000} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
           5 \\
           10 \\
         \end{bmatrix}
  \end{align},\)\(\begin{align}
    \overrightarrow{10000} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
           0 \\
           25 \\
         \end{bmatrix}
  \end{align},\)\(\begin{align}
    \overrightarrow{100000} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
           25 \\
           50 \\
         \end{bmatrix}
  \end{align}\)</p>

<p>Looking closely you might pick up on the pattern:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
\overrightarrow{(10^n)} =  \begin{cases}
5^n \begin{bmatrix}
           0 \\
           1 \\
         \end{bmatrix} &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is even} \\
5^{(n-1)} \begin{bmatrix}
           1 \\
           2 \\
         \end{bmatrix} &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is odd}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>This conditional formula was
how I initally wrote the visualization code. However it begged the question:
is there a more elegant way to compute the values without needing a conditional?
Ideally we want a transformation we could repeatedly apply to scale and rotate a vector
based on the value of \(n\), i.e. a matrix raised to the power of \(n\). With some fiddling around, we can find the matrix \(M\) and its powers:</p>

<p>\(M = \begin{bmatrix}
           -2 &amp; 1 \\
           1 &amp; 2\\
\end{bmatrix},\)\(M^2 = \begin{bmatrix}
           5 &amp; 0 \\
           0 &amp; 5\\
\end{bmatrix},\)\(M^3 = \begin{bmatrix}
           -10 &amp; 5 \\
           5 &amp; 10\\
\end{bmatrix},\)\(M^4 = \begin{bmatrix}
           25 &amp; 0 \\
           0 &amp; 25\\
\end{bmatrix}, \text{etc...}\)</p>

<p>Which conveniently matches the values we’re expecting <em>without</em> needing a conditional in the equation:</p><p>

\[\overrightarrow{(10^n)}  = M^n\overrightarrow{1} = \begin{bmatrix}
           -2 &amp; 1 \\
           1 &amp; 2\\
         \end{bmatrix}^n\begin{bmatrix}
           0 \\
           1 \\
         \end{bmatrix}\]

</p><p>Similarly we can set up equations for the other possible digits:</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\overrightarrow{(2 \cdot 10^n)} &amp;= M^n\overrightarrow{2} = \begin{bmatrix}
           -2 &amp; 1 \\
           1 &amp; 2\\
         \end{bmatrix}^n\begin{bmatrix}
           1 \\
           0 \\
         \end{bmatrix}
\newline
\overrightarrow{(3 \cdot 10^n)} &amp;= M^n\overrightarrow{3} = \begin{bmatrix}
           -2 &amp; 1 \\
           1 &amp; 2\\
         \end{bmatrix}^n\begin{bmatrix}
           0 \\
           -1 \\
         \end{bmatrix}
\newline
\overrightarrow{(4 \cdot 10^n)} &amp;= M^n\overrightarrow{4} = \begin{bmatrix}
           -2 &amp; 1 \\
           1 &amp; 2\\
         \end{bmatrix}^n\begin{bmatrix}
           -1 \\
           0 \\
         \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}\]

</p><p>If you blur your eyes with the tears shed over the cursed notation, you might
make out a connection to number systems such as base 5 or base 10.
Similar to how in base 10 the number 1234 would expand to:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
1234 &amp;= 10^3 \cdot 1 + 10^2 \cdot 2 + 10^1 \cdot 3 + 10^0 \cdot 4
\newline
1234 &amp;= 1000 + 200 + 30 + 4
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>And in base 5:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
1234_5 &amp;= 5^3 \cdot 1 + 5^2 \cdot 2 + 5^1 \cdot 3 + 5^0 \cdot 4
\newline
1234_5 &amp;= 1000_5 + 200_5 + 30_5 + 4_5
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>We can use the matrix \(M\) as our base, and vectors as our digits to encode positions
in the fractal:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\overrightarrow{1234} &amp;= M^3\overrightarrow{1} + M^2\overrightarrow{2} + M^1\overrightarrow{3} + M^0\overrightarrow{4}
\newline
\overrightarrow{1234} &amp;= \overrightarrow{1000} + \overrightarrow{200} + \overrightarrow{30} + \overrightarrow{4}
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>We’ve stumbled upon a number system with a matrix base and vector digits, rather than scalars!
Counting up from 0 we can get a feel for the how the number system connects to the structure
of the fractal:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/makeitcount.gif" alt="Gif with vectors + formulas"></p>

<h2 id="determinants">Determinants</h2>

<p>You may have noticed \(20\) and \(40\)
have switched positions compared to our original numbering. This is because our choice
of \(M\) has a negative determinant \(\det(M) = -5\), which means it has the side effect of “flipping” the
orientation of space each iteration. Now that we know our fractal is linked to linear algebra,
we can visualize the connection by overlaying scaled grids representing how powers of \(M\) act on our “digit vectors”
\(\vec{1}\), \(\vec{2}\), \(\vec{3}\) and \(\vec{4}\) a la <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/matrix-multiplication">3Blue1Brown</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/gridoverlay.gif" alt="Overlayed grid"></p>

<p>To avoid the flipping behavior we would need to pick a matrix with a positive determinant,
for example:</p><p>

\[M^\prime = \begin{bmatrix}
           2 &amp; 1 \\
           -1 &amp; 2\\
\end{bmatrix}\]

\[\det(M^\prime) = 5\]

</p><p>Visualizing this new choice of matrix:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/gridoverlayprime.gif" alt="Overlayed grid for M'"></p>

<p>Instead of “flipping” and realigning with the axes every other iteration, this choice of
base continually rotates our “digit vectors” clockwise.
Wait, didn’t we see a version of the fractal like this way back at the start with the L-System?
Sure enough, using \(M^\prime\) as our base reproduces the L-System version.</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/unwoops.jpg" alt="Unwoops"></p>

<p>Mystery solved! The two fractals are <em>almost</em> the same, but the one on my wall is generated using
\(M\) where \(\det(M) = -5\), while the more common one is generated from \(M^\prime\)
where \(\det(M^\prime) = 5\). The choice of matrix also sheds some light on where the seemingly
arbitrary “about 27 degrees” comes from. You may have noticed the absolute value of both
determinants is \(5\), which conveniently matches the way the fractal increases in size by a factor
of 5 each iteration. If we picked a matrix with a larger determinant, our “digit vectors” would
grow too quickly and leave behind “empty space” each iteration. For example adjusting \(M\) to give
it a determinant of \(-6\) results in:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/det6.jpg" alt="Determinant 6"></p>

<p>Meanwhile if we pick a matrix with a smaller determinant, our “digit vectors” would grow too
slowly and iterations would overlap. Adjusting \(M\) to give it a determinant of \(-4\):</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/det4.jpg" alt="Determinant 4"></p>

<p>So ostensibly we want a matrix base with determinant \(\pm 5\). Additionally, we want our
matrix to have integer entries to ensure it always maps our digit vectors onto
whole number coordinates. It just so happens the vector \(\left\langle 1, 2 \right\rangle\)
has integer entries and magnitude \(\sqrt{5}\), meaning we can use it and one of
its 90 degree rotations as the columns of our matrix to satisfy the determinant
and whole number constraint. Computing the angle of this vector we get \(\arctan{\frac{2}{1}} \approx 63.43^\circ\),
i.e. “about 27 degrees” away from the y-axis.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-add-part-2">How to add part 2</h2>

<p>You may have noticed vector addition fails horribly in most cases other than
the expanded form ones, e.g. \(\vec{2} + \vec{2} \neq \vec{4}\). This is expected, since the choice of \(2\) and \(4\)
were to help make the connection to base 5 number systems but unrelated to the
actual direction the vectors point. It might be more appropriate to refer to 1 through 4
as up (\(\vec{1}\)), right (\(\vec{2}\)), down (\(\vec{3}\)), and left (\(\vec{4}\)). As you
might expect, opposite directions cancel eachother out, i.e. \(\vec{1} + \vec{3} = \vec{2} + \vec{4} = \vec{0}\).
But what about other combinations of additions? By looking closely at the base 5 numbering and following where
combinations of unit vectors point:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/base5center.jpg" alt="Base 5 numbering"></p>

<p>We can build up a table based on where it appears the sum of unit vectors would fall:</p>



<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>\(+\)</th>
      <th>\(\overrightarrow{0}\hspace{5pt}\)</th>
      <th>\(\overrightarrow{1}\hspace{5pt}\)</th>
      <th>\(\overrightarrow{2}\hspace{5pt}\)</th>
      <th>\(\overrightarrow{3}\hspace{5pt}\)</th>
      <th>\(\overrightarrow{4}\hspace{5pt}\)</th>

</table>

<p>The table is symmetric across the diagonal meaning addition is commutative, as expected
for vector addition. More importantly, several additions result in 2 digit values. While it might
not seem like a big deal, it means when doing larger additions we have to worry about
carrying over values to the next digit. For example, if we want to find the number directly
above 22, we can compute \(\overrightarrow{22} + \overrightarrow{1}\). Using
traditional long addition and carrying notation:</p><p>

\[\begin{array}{cccc}
	    &amp; \overset{1}{\vphantom{0}} &amp; \overset{1}{2} &amp; 2 \\
	  + &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 1 \\
        \hline
	    &amp; 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 3 \\
	\end{array}\]

</p><p>If you’re a bit confused, remember \(\overrightarrow{2} + \overrightarrow{1} = \overrightarrow{13}\).
And if you’re suprised this works at all, join the club! Since this is a blog post and not a proof,
I leave sanity checking this addition scheme works in general to the reader.</p>



<p>The concept of using things outside of \(\mathbb{N}\) in a number system wasn’t totally unfamiliar thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_ternary">Balanced Ternary</a>
which uses \(-1\), \(0\), and \(1\) as digits, and a base of \(3\). If you imagine balanced
ternary as being 1 dimensional along the x-axis, the wallflower can be seen as its 2D analog
by adding two new digits to account for the positive and negative directions of the y-axis.
An alternative scheme for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_balanced_ternary">generalized balanced ternary</a>
already exists, and generalizes to any number of dimensions using lattices of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutohedron">permutahedrons</a>
(at least from what I’ve been able to dig up). In 2 dimensions, this ends up being the hexagonal lattice:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/hexagon.jpg" alt="2D generalized balanced ternary with hexagons"></p>

<p><em>Visualization of generalized balanced ternary in 2D using hexagons from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_balanced_ternary#/media/File:Visualization_of_three-digit_2D_generalized_balanced_ternary_numbers.pngkipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_balanced_ternary#/media/File:Visualization_of_three-digit_2D_generalized_balanced_ternary_numbers.png">Wikipedia</a>. See also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosper_curve">Gosper Curve</a>,
which is like a hexagonal wallflower.</em></p>

<p>Another exotic number system is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quater-imaginary_base">Quater-imaginary Base</a>,
which uses the imaginary value \(2i\) as its base, and \(0\), \(1\), \(2\) and \(3\) as digits.
If you imagine complex numbers as vectors, and imagine \(2i\) as a matrix that performs a scale and rotation,
we can convert this number system into our cursed notation:</p>

<p>\(M_{2i} = \begin{bmatrix}
           0 &amp; -2 \\
           2 &amp;  0\\
         \end{bmatrix},\)\(\overrightarrow{0} = \begin{bmatrix}
           0 \\
           0 \\
         \end{bmatrix},\)\(\overrightarrow{1} = \begin{bmatrix}
           1 \\
           0 \\
         \end{bmatrix},\)\(\overrightarrow{2} = \begin{bmatrix}
           2 \\
           0 \\
         \end{bmatrix},\)\(\overrightarrow{3} = \begin{bmatrix}
           3 \\
           0 \\
         \end{bmatrix}\)</p>

<p>Alternatively, we can convert the positive determinant matrix \(M^\prime\) from earlier into its
complex number equivalent to get a base \(2+i\) number system. <a href="https://ideophilus.wordpress.com/2016/10/17/balanced-base-2i-and-some-gratuitous-fractals/">Balanced base 2+i (and some gratuitous fractals)</a>
by Timothy James McKenzie Makarios explores this concept. I ran into this while looking for visualizations of
quater-imaginary base on Google images for this section, only to realize this connection had been
made back in 2016. Somewhat embarassingly I found this after I made the animation at the
start, only to find the author had already beaten me to that as well, although
using the \(M^\prime\) version of the fractal instead of \(M\) (as far as I know \(M\)
cannot be encoded as a complex number).</p>

<p>When I realized the matrix base number system worked at all I started
searching around to see if anyone else had made the connection between fractals, tesselations, linear algebra
and number systems. Digging around:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/43054/is-there-a-number-system-with-matrix-base">Project BinSys</a> led by Attila Kovács
is focused on finding matrix bases specifically where the determinant is 2, for a generalized form of binary.</li>
  <li><a href="https://people.clas.ufl.edu/avince/files/SIDMARepTess.pdf">Replicating Tesselations</a>
by Andrew Vince does all the rigorous math stuff to formalize what I’ve been trying to
describe through vigorous handwaving, and generalizes to any lattice rather than just \(\mathbb{Z}^2\).
    <ul>
      <li>Here you can also find proofs for the alternative way to generalize balanced ternary
  into higher dimensions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Speaking of handwaving: the next section is now fully in the territory of “things I
started to think about a week ago when I started writing this,” so any semblance of rigor
that came from having many years to think about the problem is out the window. Instead
I’ll be relying on my mental model of linear algebra, which is “if it sounds like it’s true
and looks like it’s true, it’s probably true.”</p>

<h2 id="to-go-even-further-beyond">To go even further beyond</h2>

<p>Middle school me was really into Minecraft, so naturally I always wondered: would the fractal work with
cubes? Specifically, is there a way to create a 3D version of the fractal by
starting with cube and copying outwards in groups of six to form a “3D plus”? This mostly
comes down to what properties we want to include when we generalize to a 3x3 matrix. The
ones that beckoned to me from the ether are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All of the entries in the matrix must be integers. This is needed so when we apply
the matrix base to our vector digits (6 unit vectors sitting on the axes) they still
have integer values for each component. In the Vince paper this is formalized as “endomorphism of \(\Lambda\)”,
i.e. a mapping from the lattice \(\Lambda = \mathbb{Z}^3\) back onto itself.</li>
  <li>Each column vector in the matrix should have a Hamming distance of 3 from the origin.
This constraint ensures the 6 copies of the “3D plus” we create on the second
iteration don’t overlap with the original centered on the origin, but are near enough to still
be adjacent to it.</li>
  <li>We want a matrix with determinant \(\pm\)7. Since each iteration of the fractal adds 6 new copies,
we increase the size of the fractal by 7 times each step. If we want to “pack” together these
copies efficiently we need to make sure the matrix we apply scales up
inputs by a factor of 7 as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>Brute force searching through triplets of vectors with Hamming distance of 3, we get this nifty 3x3
matrix that checks all of the boxes:</p><p>

\[\begin{bmatrix}
            2 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
           -1 &amp;  0 &amp; 2 \\
            0 &amp; -2 &amp; 1 \\
         \end{bmatrix}\]

</p><p>Visualizing gives us:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/3d.gif" alt="3D iterations 0 through 3"></p>

<p>Wow, it looks terrible! One problem that stands out immediately is later iterations seem to be “smooshed”
resulting in spots where previous iterations are exposed.
Looking closely at iteration 2, you might notice we can comb over the bald spots
by adding two more “3D pluses” centered on \(\left\langle 1, 1, 1\right\rangle\) and \(\left\langle-1, -1, -1\right\rangle\).</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/bandaid.gif" alt="Iteration 2 with bandaid"></p>

<p>Here we added two new pluses marked in yellow, and visualize the location of the centers
of all 8 pluses. For a bandaid fix it feels like it works a little too well. Looking at just
the center points of our 8 new pluses they are arranged like the vertices of a warped cube.
I’m still not entirely sure what to make of this, although it feels like it’s related to
the fact that cubes (8 vertices, 6 faces) are the dual solid to octahedrons (6 vertices, 8 faces).
It’s obviously tempting to try to take this new cube and make 6 copies of it, but to avoid
derailing this post too much let’s save that for another day.</p>

<p>Visually, the problem with iteration 2 seems to be that the 3D pluses aren’t placed symmetrically
around the center, causing the fractal to expand in a non-uniform way. Manually trying to find a more symmetrical
arrangement of 6 pluses is tricky, feeling a bit like trying to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball_theorem">comb a hairy ball</a>.
A sufficient (and possibly necessary) condition to prevent the smooshing behavior is
to pick a matrix where each column is mutually orthogonal and has the same magnitude. I suspect if
we include this with the prior constaints it’s impossible to satisfy in 3D. Each integer valued
column vector would need a magnitude of \(\sqrt[3]{7}\), so given that \(x, y\) and \(z\) are integers,
we must solve:</p><p>

\[\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2} = \sqrt[3]{7}\]

\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 7^{2/3}\]

</p><p>This can never be true since the left hand side is always an integer, while the right hand
side is irrational. Luckily, if we go up to four dimensions the math works out in our favor. In 4 dimensions
the components of each vector must satisfy:</p><p>

\[\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2} = \sqrt[4]{9}\]

\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 3\]

</p><p>Which works if we let 3 out of 4 of the entries to be \(\pm 1\),
and set the last to \(0\). It turns out there’s plenty of space in hyperspace, giving us many
possible matrices with columns of this form that satisfy all previous conditions. The
following matrix has one extra property that we’ll cover briefly near the end:</p><p>

\[\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 \\
1 &amp;  0 &amp; -1 &amp;  1 \\
1 &amp;  1 &amp;  0 &amp; -1 \\
1 &amp; -1 &amp;  1 &amp;  0 \\
\end{bmatrix}\]

</p><p>Now that we have a suitable matrix, we can attempt to visualize our 4D fractal.
One way to do this is to take 3D “slices” of 4D space by fixing the
value of \(w\):</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/4d_iter0.gif" alt="4D iteration 0"></p>

<p>It turns out the base case is boring regardless of how many dimensions we give it. Moving
on to iteration 1:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/4d_iter1.gif" alt="4D iteration 1"></p>

<p>From here you can get a better feel for how the visualization works. The purple cubes on the
left and right that appear to be sitting at the origin are really at the \((x,y,z,w)\)
coordinates of \((0,0,0,-1)\) and \((0,0,0,1)\) respectively.</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/4d_iter2.gif" alt="4D iteration 2"></p>

<p>We can see parts of iteration 1 still poking through in iteration 2, which is concerning given this
was a symptom of the squishing behavior we saw in 3D. However looking closely, the squishing
behavior doesn’t seem as bad yet. If you really twist your mind around the concept of 4
dimensions, you might be able to see that while the two pluses in \(w=0\) don’t
seem to be balanced, there are 3 pluses sitting to the left (\(w=-1\)) and 3 more to the
right (\(w=1\)) that you could imagine as being orthogonal to the \(w=0\) ones. The trios
of cubes sitting at each side (\(w=\pm 2\)) are part of the 4D pluses that poke through
the 4th dimension into the slices on the ends.</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/4d_iter3.gif" alt="4D iteration 3"></p>

<p>My main takeaway from this is that while iteration 2
can still be seen, iteration 1 has now been completely covered.
Technically iteration 3 extends farther out in the \(w\) dimension, but at this point it’s
difficult to comprehend the fractal anyway. I imagine this is the sort of thing my higher dimensional analog would
put up on the 4D hypersurface of their room’s 5D walls to admire in its full glory, so I’m dubbing it “the orthotopeflower.”
Unfortunately my apartment is measured in square feet and not hypercubic feet, so
it’s difficult for me to fully appreciate it. There are a couple of issues with the “3D slices”
approach of visualizing in 4D:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It extends way too quickly in the horizontal direction, wasting precious screen
(or wall) real estate. Notably in iteration 3 we
need to add 2 more slices to each side to visualize the whole thing.</li>
  <li>My inferior 3 dimensional eyes can’t see the interior of 3D objects (unlike how I’m
able to see the interior of colored in 2D squares on a piece of paper), making it
hard to fully appreciate the structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>To get around both of these limitations we can use the following 7x7 grid of 7x7 grids to visualize it
a la the very first animation of this post:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/grow4d.gif" alt="Flat 4D animation"></p>

<p><em><a href="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/static4d.jpg">Here’s a static image</a> of the last iteration if you want to admire it. If this isn’t nice, what is?</em></p>

<p>Each smaller grid shows a slice of -3 to 3 on the x and y axes. The “grid of grids” represent
-3 to 3 along the z and w axes. Whenever a square crosses from one small grid
to another it’s really being translated through the z or w axis. Squares that appear to
fade in or fade out are moving in or out of the 7x7x7x7 “viewing window” in 4 dimensions.
Compared to the line of 3D slices, this approach uses screen real estate a bit better
(growing as a square instead of in a line), and lets you see the interior of the entire
fractal without obscuring previous iterations. Plus this design would go nicely with
the existing fractal on my wall.</p>

<p>If we’re willing to discard all of the flourishes from the animation and assign 1 pixel
per tile in the fractal we can increase our viewing window up to 31x31x31x31:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/31x31x31x31.png" alt="31x31x31x31 visualization"></p>

<p>It’s a lot to take in, but at the very least seems to confirm that the fractal consistently
expands outwards without excessive smooshing like we saw in 3D. And personally, I think
it would make a lovely quilt or picnic blanket. In particular these slices near the very
center are remarkably pleasant:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/quilt.png" alt="Aesthetically pleasing slices 2D slices of the fractal"></p>

<p>A natural question is if we can continue into higher dimensions. Sadly I suspect the
answer is no. Applying all our constraints from earlier we need a dimension \(d\) such that:</p>

<p>\(\sqrt[d]{2d+1} \in\)\(\{\sqrt{3^2}, \sqrt{1^2 + 2^2}, \sqrt{1^2+1^2+1^2}\}\)</p>

<p>The left hand side is the magnitude each column vector needs to be for a matrix with \(d\) mutually
orthogonal columns to have determinant \(2d+1\) so that it scales inputs enough to fit the \(2d\) copies added each iteration.
The right hand side is the set of possible magnitudes of integer valued vectors that have a Hamming distance of 3 away from the origin, so
the copies created in the second iteration touch but don’t intersect with the first iteration.
Graphing this, it looks like the only dimensions where these can be satisifed are 1 (balanced
ternary), 2 (the wallflower/quadratic flake), and 4 (the orthotopeflower).</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/desmos.jpg" alt="Demos graph of viable dimensions"></p>

<p>Finally, as mentioned earlier, the choice of matrix to use as the base of our 4D number system was special. In particular
it encodes the quaternion \(i+j+k\), meaning similar to quater imaginary base we now
have a way to encode quaternions in “balanced nonary quaternion base”. In this scheme
the 9 possible digits are \(0\), \(\pm1\), \(\pm i\), \(\pm j\) and \(\pm k\), with base \(i+j+k\). Since I’m not too familiar
with quaternions and still not entirely sure if this actually works, I’ll be delegating
this problem to a future version of me who knows more math. This strategy seemed to work
pretty well last time.</p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>

<p>I once had a dream about a post-scarcity society that had to work around the problem of
people not having any motivation to do anything, since all their basic needs were met.
To give people something to do, every few years everyone over a certain age was expected
to report on something beautiful they learned or discovered about the world, otherwise
they’d be turned into soylent or something (Note: post-scarcity \(\neq\) utopia). Anyway, I’d like to
imagine the discovery of a strange flower with jigsaw-like petals blooming endlessly across 4
dimensional space would be enough to keep me off the chopping block for awhile.</p>

<p>I finally got around to this in an attempt attempt to reignite some passion for math and programming
after a period of burnout. It turns out my younger
self left behind the perfect gift in the form of a scavenger hunt across the domains of fractals, number systems,
linear algebra and higher dimensions. It makes me curious about how many other interesting
ideas other people have lying around in plain sight as sketches or To Do’s.</p>

<p>If this post comes off as a bit rambly from the many twists and turns between domains it’s
because I tried to follow the path I took while haphazardly picking up and forgetting
about the problem over the years. There are a handful of spots where you might ask “how did you know
doing this specific thing would lead to that?” The simple answer is I had no clue if any of this
would lead anywhere, I just tried different things on a whim and this post outlines the parts that stuck.
Hopefully by writing and visualizing my lines of reasoning I’m able to make the connections a bit more accessible
for future fractal fiddlers finding themselves falling face first down the same rabbit hole.</p>

<p>As a final twist, an astute reader may have
noticed none of the visualizations made for this post
matched the fractal on my wall in the post’s thumbnail. The 4th iteration (green) is copied about 27
degrees in the <em>wrong</em> direction:</p>

<p><img src="https://chriskw.xyz/images/fractal/closingwoops.jpg" alt="Closing woops"></p>

<p>In a fun case of “why do I remember this, but not what I ate for dinner 2 days ago,” I
remember my exact reasoning for doing this over a decade ago: I thought the fractal
would unalign itself from the cardinal directions if I always tilted it off the axes in the
same direction. As we saw earlier with \(M\) vs \(M^\prime\) my intuition to compensate for tilt almost made sense, other
than the fact it already corrects itself in alternating steps. I was a bit
embarassed about this until I remembered even Donald Knuth
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v678Em6qyzk">made a wrong turn</a> when putting up a fractal on his wall.
Fools rarely differ!</p>

  <li><strong>Resources</strong> that are exposed via URIs; it’s up to the client application’s design to decide how these are fetched or used.</li>
  <li><strong>Sampling</strong>, which allows servers to request LLM completions on the client application, which is useful for agentic patterns and running context-aware inference without needing to receive all the contextual data from the client.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few more functions and nuances to servers, but these are what broadly stood out to me. Most servers that I have seen or used mostly just expose tool calls.</p>

<h2 id="a-tiny-concrete-example-an-mcp-server-for-open-data-access">A tiny concrete example: an MCP server for Open Data access</h2>

<p>I wrote a tiny MCP server to expose actions to take on CKAN, an open source data management system that’s used by Governments and other organisations to publish open datasets. CKAN has a web interface that links to these tagged datasets, which are usually semi-structured (CSVs, XLS) or totally unstructured (PDF reports and papers).</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.nilenso.com/images/blog/screenshot-2025-05-14-at-15.48.51.png" alt="A view of the CKAN interface"></p>

<p>This is not particularly conducive to discovery and drilling through data. It’s also significant friction to connect dots across datasets. I thought it would be nice to have an AI application that can access all the datasets on CKAN and make sense of it. Open Data is as useful as the insights that can be extracted from it.</p>

<p>One way for me to have approached this is to write an AI application from scratch encoded with knowledge about all the CKAN REST APIs. Unfortunately, this would have “locked in” AI use of CKAN open data sets to just my application. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free">And data, especially Open Data wants to be free</a>.</p>

<p>What I really wanted is a well-known “doorknob” that a lot of AI applications and agents in the world would know how to open. This is what MCP servers do. I wrote one in a couple of hours.</p>

<p>I used the official MCP Python SDK and defined some tools. Here’s an excerpt of what that looks like:</p>

</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The details of the SDK are better explained in official guides, but the gist of it is that it is an abstraction over JSON-RPC request-response messages that are defined in the protocol. The server I have implemented runs locally, launched as a subprocess by the client app and uses the stdio streams to pass these protocol messages around. Remote MCP servers are a thing as well.</p>

<p>After I wrote this server, I exposed it to the Claude desktop app, which is also an MCP client by editing <code>claude_desktop_config.json</code>. I pointed it to <a href="https://justicehub.in/">JusticeHub</a>, a CKAN instance that contains legal and justice data, created by the folks at <a href="https://civicdatalab.in/">CivicDataLabs</a>.</p>

<p>This allowed me to use this data through Claude.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.nilenso.com/images/blog/screenshot-2025-05-15-at-16.51.51.png" alt="A screenshot of a conversation with an AI assistant about exploring JusticeHub open data.

<p><img src="https://blog.nilenso.com/images/blog/screenshot-2025-05-15-at-16.52.08.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Claude discovered my MCP server and gave me a summary of what kind of data was available in JusticeHub.</p>

The overview includes key dataset categories like Judicial System Performance, Legal Budget and Financial Data, Legal Aid and Access to Justice, and Parliamentary and Legislative Data, with bullet points listing specific datasets under each category."></p>

<p>I was able to take advantage of Claude’s analysis tool to help me visualise the data in an interactive dashboard!</p>

<p>I can envision other MCP clients in the future that could make better use of this data, beyond this basic conversational interface and tackle problems such as backlinks and provenance, while providing more structured, opinionated visualisations and analysis.</p>

<h2 id="should-i-build-an-mcp">Should I build “an MCP”?</h2>

<p>It’s worth noting that this is not a mature protocol—<a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/development/roadmap">it is continuously evolving</a>. But the adoption has been fantastic—I opened the first random MCP aggregating website and it lists over 4000 servers coming from various organisations and individuals. I’d estimate there’s a lot more out there.</p>

<p>Building against MCP is a clear, well-defined thing to do, something that’s rare in the volatile landscape of AI. This could explain its popularity. But it doesn’t make a good product. It’s another tool in your toolbox.</p>

<p>I (and other folks at nilenso) maintain that good products are built on a foundation that requires software engineering maturity, and this is especially true of AI products.</p>

<p>So let’s revisit what MCP brings to the table:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Turns M ⨯ N integration problem by turning it into an M + N integration problem.</li>
  <li>Decouples AI client applications from AI tools and workflows for a platform.</li>
</ul>

<p>This decoupling is not free of cost. There is extra scaffolding to make your applications talk this protocol. Your LLM performance is sensitive to prompting and tool descriptions. Adding lots of tools indiscriminately affects latencies and overall quality of your responses.</p>

<p>It makes sense for GitHub to expose repository actions for AI tools like Cursor or Windsurf to carry out. This is a valuable form of decoupling.</p>

<p>Does it make sense to have this decoupling for an internal tool, where the clients and servers are under your control, and the value comes from having well-optimised finetuned responses? Probably not.</p>

<p>Anywho, here’s some references. Happy building.</p>

<p><span>The ever-growing market</span> for personal data has been a boon for American spy agencies. The U.S. intelligence community is now buying up vast volumes of sensitive information that would have previously required a court order, essentially bypassing the Fourth Amendment. But the surveillance state has encountered a problem: There’s simply too much data on sale from too many corporations and brokers.</p>



<p>So the government has a plan for a one-stop shop.</p>



<p>The Office of the Director of National Intelligence is working on a system to centralize and “streamline” the use of commercially available information, or CAI, like location data derived from mobile ads, by American spy agencies, according to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25949136-1-ic-data-consortium-other-transaction/">contract</a> <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25949135-2-appendix-a-building-ic-data-consortium-interface-at-wwwicdatagov/">documents</a> reviewed by The Intercept. The data portal will include information deemed by the ODNI as highly sensitive, that which can be “misused to cause substantial harm, embarrassment, and inconvenience to U.S. persons.” The documents state spy agencies will use the web portal not just to search through reams of private data, but also run them through artificial intelligence tools for further analysis.</p>



<p>Rather than each agency purchasing CAI individually, as has been the case until now, the “Intelligence Community Data Consortium” will provide a single convenient web-based storefront for searching and accessing this data, along with a “data marketplace” for purchasing “the best data at the best price,” faster than ever before, according to the documents. It will be designed for the 18 different federal agencies and offices that make up the U.S. intelligence community, including the National Security Agency, CIA, FBI Intelligence Branch, and Homeland Security’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis — though one document suggests the portal will also be used by agencies not directly related to intelligence or defense.</p>



<p>“In practice, the Data Consortium would provide a one-stop shop for agencies to cheaply purchase access to vast amounts of Americans’ sensitive information from commercial entities, sidestepping constitutional and statutory privacy protections,” said Emile Ayoub, a lawyer with the Brennan Center’s liberty and national security program.</p>



<p>“ODNI is working to streamline a number of inefficient processes, including duplicative contracts to access existing data, and ensuring Americans civil liberties and Fourth Amendment rights are upheld,” ODNI spokesperson Olivia Coleman said in a statement to The Intercept. Coleman did not answer when asked if the new platform would sell access to data on U.S. citizens, or how it would make use of artificial intelligence.</p>



  



<p>Spy agencies and military intelligence offices have for years <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/06/24/fbi-surveillance-social-media-cellphone-dataminr-venntel/">freely purchased</a> sensitive personal information rather than obtain it by dint of a judge’s sign-off. Thanks largely to unscrupulous advertisers and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/04/09/coronavirus-trump-smartphone-tracking/">app-makers</a> working in a <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/11/04/treasury-surveillance-location-data-babel-street/">regulatory vacuum</a>, it’s <strong>trivial</strong> to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/02/18/location-data-tracking-irs-dhs-digital-envoy/">procure </a>extremely sensitive information about virtually anyone with an online presence. Smartphones in particular leave behind <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/10/26/cellphone-roaming-location-tracking-surveillance/">immense plumes of data</a>, including detailed records of your movement that can be bought and sold by anyone with an interest. The ODNI has previously defined “sensitive” CAI as information “not widely known about an individual that could be used to cause harm to the person’s reputation, emotional well-being, or physical safety.” Procurement documents reviewed by The Intercept make clear the project is designed to provide access to this highest “sensitive” tier of CAI.</p>



<p>The documents provide a glimpse at some of the many types of CAI available, including “information addressing economic security, supply chain, critical infrastructure protection, great power competition, agricultural data, industrial data, sentiment analysis, and video analytic services.”</p>



<p>While the proliferation of data that can reveal intimate details about virtually anyone has alarmed civil libertarians, privacy advocates, and certain members of Congress, the intelligence community sees another problem: There’s too much data to keep organized, and the disorganized process of buying it is wasting money. To address this overabundance, the ODNI is seeking private sector vendors to build and manage a new “commercial data consortium that unifies commercial data acquisition then enables IC users to access and interact with this commercial data in one place,” according to <strong>one</strong> procurement document obtained by The Intercept.</p>



<p>The ODNI says the platform, the “Intelligence Community (IC) Data Consortium (ICDC),” will help correct the currently “fragmented and decentralized” purchase of commercial data like smartphone location pings, real estate records, biometric data, and social media content. The document laments how often various spy agencies are buying the same data without realizing it. The ODNI says this new platform, which will live at <a href="http://www.icdata.gov/">www.icdata.gov</a>, will “help streamline access to CAI for the entire IC and make it available to mission users in a more cohesive, efficient, and cost-effective manner by avoiding duplicative purchases, preventing sunk costs from unused licenses, and reducing overall data storage and compute costs,” while also incorporating “civil liberties and privacy best practices.”</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“The IC is still adhering to the ‘just grab all of it, we’ll find something to do with it’ mentality.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>While the project’s nod to civil liberties might come as some relief to privacy advocates, the project also represents the extent to which the use of this inherently controversial form of surveillance is here to stay. “Clearly the IC is still adhering to the ‘just grab all of it, we’ll find something to do with it’ mentality rather than being remotely thoughtful about only collecting data it needs or has a specific envisioned use for,” said Calli Schroeder, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Project.</p>



<!-- BLOCK(cta)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) -->


<!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[0] -->



<p>Once the website is up and running, the procurement materials say the portal will eventually allow users to analyze the data using large language models, AI-based text tools prone to major factual errors and fabrications. The portal will also facilitate “sentiment analysis,” an often pseudoscientific endeavor purporting to discern one’s opinion about a given topic using implicit signals in their behavior, movement, or speech.</p>



<p>Such analysis is a “huge cause for concern” according to Schroeder. “It means the intelligence community is still, to at least some degree, buying into the false promise of a constantly and continuously debunked practice,” she said. “Let me be clear: Sentiment analysis not only does not work, it cannot work. Its only consistent success has been in perpetuating harmful discrimination (of gender, culture, race, and neurodivergence, among others).”</p>



<p>Whether for sentiment analysis or some other goal, using CAI data sets to query an AI crystal ball poses serious risks, said Ayoub. If such analysis worked as billed, “AI tools make it easier to extract, re-identify, and infer sensitive information about people’s identities, locations, ideologies, and habits — amplifying risks to Americans’ privacy and freedoms of speech and association,” he said. On top of that, “These tools are a black box with little insight into training data, metric, or reliability of outcomes. The IC’s use of these tools typically comes with high risk, questionable track records, and little accountability, especially now that AI policy safeguards were rescinded early in this administration.”</p>



<p>In 2023, the ODNI declassified a 37-page report detailing the vastly expanding use of such CAI data by the U.S. intelligence community, and the threat this poses to the millions of Americans whose lives are cataloged, packaged, and sold by a galaxy of unregulated data brokers. The report, drafted for then-director of national intelligence Avril Haines, included a dire warning to the public: “Today, in a way that far fewer Americans seem to understand, and even fewer of them can avoid, CAI includes information on nearly everyone that is of a type and level of sensitivity that historically could have been obtained, if at all, only through targeted (and predicated) collection, and that could be used to cause harm to an individual’s reputation, emotional well-being, or physical safety.”</p>



  



<p>The extent to which CAI has commodified spy powers previously attainable only by well-resourced governments cannot be overstated: In 2021, for instance, The Intercept reported the existence of Anomaly Six, a startup that <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/05/04/surveillance-anomaly-six-phone-tracking/">buys geolocational data</a> leaked from smartphones apps. During an Anomaly Six presentation, the company demonstrated its ability to track not only the Chinese navy through the phones of its sailors, but also <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/04/22/anomaly-six-phone-tracking-zignal-surveillance-cia-nsa/">follow CIA and NSA employees as they commuted to and from work</a>.</p>



<p>The ICDC project reflects a fundamental dissonance within the intelligence community, which acknowledges that CAI is a major threat to the public while refusing to cease buying it. “The government would never have been permitted to compel billions of people to carry location tracking devices on their persons at all times, to log and track most of their social interactions, or to keep flawless records of all their reading habits,” the ODNI wrote in its 2022 report. While conceding “unfettered access to CAI increases its power in ways that may exceed our constitutional traditions or other societal expectations,” the report says, “the IC cannot willingly blind itself to this information.”</p>



<p>In 2024, following the declassified report and the alarm it generated, the ODNI put forth a set of CAI usage rules purporting to establish guardrails against privacy violations and other abuses. The framework earned praise from some corners for requiring the intelligence community to assess the origin and sensitivity of CAI before using it, and for placing more rigorous requirements on agencies that wish to use the most intimate forms of private data. But critics were quick to point out that the ODNI’s rules, which enshrined the intelligence community’s “flexibility to experiment” with CAI, amounted to more self-regulation from a part of the government with a poor track record of self-regulating.</p>



<p>While sensitive CAI comes with more rules — like keeping records of its use, protecting its storage, and some disclosure requirements — these guidelines offer great deal latitude to the intelligence community. The rule about creating a paper trail pertaining to sensitive CAI use, for example, is mandated only “to the extent practicable and consistent with the need to protect intelligence sources and methods,” and can be ignored entirely in “exigent circumstances.” In other words, it’s not really a requirement at all.</p>



<p>Ayoub told The Intercept he worries the ICDC plan will only entrench this self-policing approach. The documents note that vendors would be tasked to some extent with determining whether the data they sell is indeed sensitive, and therefore subject to stricter privacy safeguards, rather than a third party. “Relying on private vendors to determine whether CAI is considered sensitive may increase the risk that the IC purchases known categories of sensitive information without sufficient safeguards for privacy and civil liberties or the warrant, court order, or subpoena they would otherwise need to obtain,” he said.</p>



<p>The portal idea appears to have started under the Biden administration, when it was known as the “Data Co-Op.” It now looks like it will go live during a Trump administration. Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency is already working on building and streamlining access to other large repositories of perilously sensitive information. In March, the Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/15/doge-ssa-immigration-trump-housing/">reported</a> that DOGE workers intent on breaking down “information silos” across the federal government were trying to “unify systems into one central hub aims to advance multiple Trump administration priorities, including finding and deporting undocumented immigrants.” The documents note that the portal will also be accessible to so-called “non-Title 50” agencies outside of the national defense and intelligence apparatus.</p>



<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) -->

<!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->



<p>Ayoub argued the intelligence community can’t provide access to its upcoming CAI portal without “raising the risk that agencies like DHS’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) would access the CAI database to identify and target noncitizens such as student protestors based on their search or browsing histories and location information.”</p>



<p>While the ODNI has acknowledged the importance of transparency, usernames for the portal will not include the name of the analyst’s agency, “thus obscuring any specific participation from individual participants,” according to the project documents.</p>



<p>“The irony is not lost on me that they are making efforts to protect individuals within the IC from being identified regarding their participation in this project but have no qualms about vacuuming up the personal data of Americans against their wishes and knowledge,” said Schroeder.</p>



<p>Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a longtime critic of the Fourth Amendment end run posed by CAI, expressed concern to The Intercept over how the portal will ultimately be used. “Policies are one thing, but I’m concerned about what the government is actually doing with data about Americans that it buys from data brokers,” he said in a statement. “All indications from news reports and Trump administration officials are that Americans should be extremely worried about how this administration may be using commercial data.”</p>
