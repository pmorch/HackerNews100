<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-3">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>Microsoft bundles video conferencing app Teams with its productivity based Office 365 and Microsoft 365 subscriptions.</li><li>The European Commission is expected to investigate whether or not the pairing is a violation of antitrust laws.</li><li>Reports in April of this year indicated that Microsoft was already contemplating separating the two products, possibly as a pre-emptive measure to prevent antitrust investigations.</li></ul><hr><p>When it comes to Microsoft's entanglements with regulators, all eyes are currently on the <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard King acquisition</a> on behalf of Xbox. Microsoft has gone head-to-head with the <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-activision-deal-for-xbox-takes-another-step-forward-in-the-uk">Competition and Market Authority (CMA)</a> of the UK and the US's <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/xbox-vs-ftc">Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</a> both recently as it moves to close the ABK deal. Still, the gaming sector of Microsoft is not the only department currently under a regulatory microscope. The European Commission (EC) may be planning to investigate whether or not Microsoft's bundling of the video conferencing software Teams with productivity-based app subscription Office 365 was legal.</p><p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/014172b7-d125-442a-addd-85b7a71d34b1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://www.ft.com/content/014172b7-d125-442a-addd-85b7a71d34b1">Reportedly</a>, the EC and Microsoft are at odds over whether the pricing of Teams limits opportunities for fair competition from similar video conferencing apps such as <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/slack">Slack</a> and <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/zoom">Zoom</a>. Slack filed a complaint with the EU in 2020, claiming that Microsoft was "force installing [Teams] for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers."&nbsp;</p><p>In April, it was reported that <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/is-microsoft-going-to-debundle-teams-and-office-one-report-says-thats-exactly-whatll-happen">Microsoft was considering allowing users to install Office without installing Teams</a> in an effort to appease regulators and avoid additional scrutiny or official investigations by the EC. Similarly, Microsoft was also set to charge different prices for Office with and without Teams integration. Those efforts seemed to have not been sufficient enough to sway the EU, which is expected to begin a deep dive into Microsoft's bundling practices as early as next week, with a formal investigation expected as early as the fall.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/17/eu_regulator_to_next_week/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/17/eu_regulator_to_next_week/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">statement from Microsoft</a>, the company is "open to pragmatic solutions that address its [The EC's] concerns and serve customers well." Meanwhile, members of the European Parliament have put pressure on the EC to launch an investigation stating that it has been 3 years since Slack's initial complaint. Yet, Microsoft's dominant position in the market continues to grow as the complainants continue waiting for meaningful progress in the case. &nbsp;Slack has an estimated 50 million users, while Microsoft's Teams has roughly 300 million—some of which the EC fears may have been acquired through ill-gotten means.</p><p>Slack is not the only competitor to lodge antitrust complaints at Microsoft as of late. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/google">Google </a>and <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/amazon">AWS</a> both have also accused the Redmond-based tech giant of anticompetitive efforts regarding the cloud market and utilizing "licensing taxes." In 2008 Microsoft was charged $1.35 billion in fines for failing to comply with a 2004 antitrust ruling that found the tech company was charging exuberant fees to its competitors for interoperability information.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Imagine you are new to Rust and you want to learn some async programming. Writing a chat server is a common way to start, scope is small enough to contain in a blog post, yet it is complex enough to learn most of what you'll need to build async servers in Rust. One DuckDuckGo query and we are off to the races: <a href="https://outcrawl.com/rust-react-realtime-chat">Building a Real-time Chat App in Rust and React</a> by <a href="https://outcrawl.com/authors/tin-rabzelj/">Tin Rabzejl</a>. First line reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This article covers building a chat app in Rust using <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/">asynchronous code</a>.</p>

<p>Asynchronous code, that's what we want, great! This is a very well written article, and being from 2020 it's still very much in vogue. There are some low-hanging performance tweaks I might do, but as example code to cover the basics I think this works really well. We have Tokio for runtime and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/warp">warp</a> for WebSockets, pretty standard affair.</p>
<p>So let's look through this article and see what do we need to learn to write asynchronous Rust:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>async</code> functions and <code>.await</code> syntax.</li>
<li>Futures and <code>tokio::select!</code>.</li>
<li><code>RwLock</code> and why it's better than <code>Mutex</code> for this case.</li>
<li><code>sync::mpsc</code> channels.</li>
<li>Our main shared-state thing lives inside an <code>Arc</code> and we clone that a bunch.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice something about this list? Except for the first two, nothing here has anything to do with <em>asynchronous programming</em>. Yes the <code>RwLock</code> and <code>mpsc</code> comes from Tokio and lets you <code>.await</code> instead of blocking a thread, but these are not async primitives, <em>these are multi-threading synchronization primitives</em>.</p>
<p>Let's step back a little and actually think about the problem we are trying to solve. This is a simple chat server, how likely is it that it's ever going to be more CPU bound than I/O bound? I'd say that probability is pretty low. If you know anything about asynchronous sockets it should be that <strong>multi-threading a socket doesn't actually yield you more requests / second, and <a href="https://github.com/fundon/smol-tokio-hyper-benchmarks">it can actually lower it</a></strong> (slightly, but still).</p>
<p>This is why <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a> are so good: it defaults to a single-threaded JavaScript event loop handling huge amounts of requests that is easy to write, and when you need to utilize multiple CPU cores, you just spawn multiple processes that listen on the same socket. This is a much better way of structuring servers, except for all that JavaScript, of course.</p>
<p>The Original Sin of Rust async programming is making it multi-threaded by default. If premature optimization is the root of all evil, this is the mother of all premature optimizations, and it curses all your code with the unholy <code>Send + 'static</code>, or worse yet <code>Send + Sync + 'static</code>, which just <em>kills all the joy of actually writing Rust</em>.</p>
<h2>Actually Pleasant Async Rust</h2>
<p>So <a href="https://twitter.com/FiresOfEschaton">I'm writing a multiplayer game</a> in Rust, and the server part of it is really quite similar to what a chat server would do: there is an instance of a <em><code>Battle</code></em> which is a chat-room analog, a message comes in from one of the clients, it gets processed, and then the outcome gets broadcast to all client in that instance, just like a chat message in a room would be. And here is the piece of code that handles that currently built on top of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/async-io"><code>async-io</code></a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/async-executor"><code>async-executor</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code><em>// This is spawned as a task in a `LocalExecutor`. `BattleManager` outlives
// the executor, so I can just send it in by reference 🤯</em>
<b>pub async fn</b> <u>battle</u>(<i>stream</i><b>:</b> <u>Async</u>&lt;<i>TcpStream</i>&gt;, <i>manager</i><b>: &amp;</b><u>BattleManager</u>) {
    <em>// `!Sync` read and write halves of WebSocket using a modified Soketto</em>
    <b>let</b> <i>server</i> = <i>UnsyncServer</i><b>::</b><u>new</u>(<i>stream</i>);
    <b>let</b> (<b>mut</b> <i>sender</i>, <b>mut</b> <i>receiver</i>) = <i>server</i><b>.</b><u>split</u>();

    <em>// `!Sync` read and write halves of a quasi-ring buffer.</em>
    <b>let</b> (<i>writer</i>, <b>mut</b> <i>reader</i>) = <i>new_shared</i>();

    <em>// We find a battle to put this socket into, and do just that.
    // Each battle instance is wrapped in `Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;_&gt;&gt;`.</em>
    <b>let</b> <i>battle</i> = <i>manager</i><b>.</b><u>matchmake</u>();
    <b>let</b> <i>cid</i> = <i>battle</i><b>.</b><u>borrow_mut</u>()<b>.</b><u>join</u>(<i>writer</i>);

    <em>// Loop handling outgoing messages turned into a simple future</em>
    <b>let</b> <i>outgoing</i> = <b>async move</b> {
        <b>while let</b> <u>Some</u>(<b>mut</b> <i>buf</i>) = <i>reader</i><b>.</b><u>read</u>()<b>.await</b> {
            <b>if let</b> <u>Err</u>(<i>err</i>) = <i>sender</i><b>.</b><u>send</u>(<b>&amp;mut </b><u>buf</u>[<b>..</b>])<b>.await</b> {
                <i>log</i><b>::</b><u>error</u>!(<a>"Connection error: {err:?}"</a>);
                <b>break</b>;
            }
            <em>// `buf` is dropped here, which safely advances read head</em>
        }

        <b>let</b> _ = <i>sender</i><b>.</b><u>close</u>()<b>.await</b>;
    };

    <em>// Loop handling incoming messages turned into a simple future</em>
    <b>let</b> <i>incoming</i> = <b>async move</b> {
        <b>let mut</b> <i>data</i> = <i>Vec</i><b>::</b><u>new</u>();

        <b>loop</b> {
            <i>data</i><b>.</b><u>clear</u>();

            <b>if</b> <i>receiver</i><b>.</b><u>receive_data</u>(<b>&amp;mut </b><u>data</u>)<b>.await.</b><u>is_err</u>() {
                <i>battle</i><b>.</b><u>borrow_mut</u>()<b>.</b><u>leave</u>(<i>cid</i>);
                <b>break</b>;
            }

            <b>let mut</b> <i>battle</i> = <i>battle</i><b>.</b><u>borrow_mut</u>();

            <em>// Process incoming messages</em>
            <b>for</b> <i>client_message</i> <b>in</b> <i>core</i><b>::</b><u>Decoder</u><b>::</b><u>new</u>(<b>&amp;</b><u>data</u>) {
                <i>battle</i><b>.</b><u>handle_message</u>(<i>cid</i>, <i>client_message</i>);
            }

            <em>// Broadcast all outgoing messages buffered for all clients</em>
            <i>battle</i><b>.</b><u>flush</u>();
        }
    };

    <em>// Zip (join) the two futures together so the two loops can run
    // concurrently. Yes sometimes I double-poll one, who cares.</em>
    <i>zip</i>(<i>incoming</i>, <i>outgoing</i>)<b>.await</b>;

    <i>log</i><b>::</b><u>info</u>!(<a>"Connection closed"</a>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is pretty easy, and it looks almost like synchronous Rust. Yes I have some <code>RefCell</code>s, but compared to <code>Mutex</code>es or <code>RwLock</code>s borrowing a <code>RefCell</code> is virtually free. And if you can prove to yourself that your stuff is never double-borrowed, you could do some custom wrappers using <code>UnsafeCell</code> to make it literally free.</p>
<p>The guts of my shared buffer look roughly like this:</p>
<pre><code>#[repr(transparent)]
<b>pub struct</b> <u>BufWriter</u>(<i>Rc</i>&lt;<i>Inner</i>&gt;);

#[repr(transparent)]
<b>pub struct</b> <u>BufReader</u>(<i>Rc</i>&lt;<i>Inner</i>&gt;);

<b>struct</b> <u>Inner</u> {
    <i>write_head</i><b>:</b> <u>Cell</u>&lt;<u>u32</u>&gt;,
    <i>read_head</i><b>:</b> <u>Cell</u>&lt;<u>u32</u>&gt;,
    <i>waker</i><b>:</b> <u>Cell</u>&lt;<i>Option</i>&lt;<i>Waker</i>&gt;&gt;,
    <i>buffer</i><b>:</b> <u>UnsafeCell</u>&lt;[<u>u8</u>; <i>BUF_SIZE</i>]&gt;,
}
</code></pre>
<p>If using unsafe makes your heart skip a beat, <code>RefCell</code> would be an option too. Since reading the buffer can <code>.await</code>, and since there is only ever one <code>BufReader</code> I also only ever need to manage one <code>Waker</code>. When manually implementing a <code>Future</code> registering a waker is as simple as:</p>
<pre><code><i>inner</i><b>.</b><u>waker</u><b>.</b><u>set</u>(<u>Some</u>(<i>cx</i><b>.</b><u>waker</u>()<b>.</b><u>clone</u>()));
</code></pre>
<p>And waking the waker is as simple as:</p>
<pre><code><em>// This is effectively the same as `inner.waker.take()`
// if we didn't have the `Cell` wrapper.</em>
<b>if let</b> <u>Some</u>(<i>waker</i>) = <i>inner</i><b>.</b><u>waker</u><b>.</b><u>replace</u>(<u>None</u>) {
    <i>waker</i><b>.</b><u>wake</u>();
}
</code></pre>
<p>No <code>unsafe</code>, no <a href="https://crates.io/crates/atomic-waker">atomic-waker</a>, no need for a Ph.D. in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/enum.Ordering.html">atomic op ordering</a>, no magic, just single threaded things.</p>
<h2>Hidden Costs</h2>
<p>Just switching to a <a href="https://docs.rs/async-executor/latest/async_executor/struct.LocalExecutor.html">LocalExecutor</a> or something like Tokio <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/task/struct.LocalSet.html">LocalSet</a> should be enough, but unfortunately that alone does not free your code from unnecessary thread synchronization. Like the WebSocket in <em>warp</em> that our chat example uses, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/soketto">Soketto</a> is using <code>BiLock</code>s to guarantee safe access to the underlying socket. In fact both <code>Sender</code> and <code>Receiver</code> in Soketto need the ability to write in order to respond to PINGs with PONGs when reading, and just for that writing to a socket has to go through <em>two</em> separate <code>BiLock</code>s (one inside the <code>WriteHalf</code>, and one around it). Even if you discount the actual locking mechanisms, just having all that pointer indirection should be a red flag 🚩.</p>
<p>I'm writing all this because I've contributed a bunch to Soketto myself and never thought that to be a problem, so I too am not without sin. Making things thread safe for runtime-agnostic utilities like WebSocket is yet another price we pay for making everything multi-threaded by default. The standard way of doing what I'm doing in my code above would be to spawn one of the loops on a separate background task, which could land on a separate thread, meaning we <strong>must</strong> do all that synchronization to manage reading and writing to a socket from different threads <strong>for no good reason</strong>.</p>
<p>Luckily those assumptions are made exclusively in the ecosystem, neither the standard library nor Rust itself bakes in any of such assumptions for async. Yes, the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/task/trait.Wake.html"><code>Wake</code></a> trait requires an <code>Arc</code>, <s>but even that has an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/task/struct.RawWaker.html">escape hatch</a></s><sup><a href="#n1">1)</a></sup>. <strong>We can fix this</strong>, and all it takes is writing utilities that are <code>!Sync</code> and evangelizing the use of local async executors as the default option, as it should be.</p>
<h2>But I need Threads!</h2>
<p>Of course writing single-threaded servers isn't always the optimal choice, it likely isn't for most cases, isn't that why multi-threaded task executors <em>should</em> be the default?</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>If you write regular synchronous Rust code, unless you have a really good reason, you don't just start with a thread-pool. You write single-threaded code until you find a place where threads can help you, and <em>then</em> you parallelize it, which can be as simple as replacing <code>iter</code> with <code>par_iter</code> using <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rayon">Rayon</a>. Rust is <em>exceptional</em> at adding safe parallelization to your code, and for the most part this is how Rust is written everywhere, <em>except async</em>.</p>
<p>It's <em>easy</em> to parallelize a server that's using local task executors in Rust, you just spawn multiple threads, each with its own executor. Like in your bog standard non-async Rust the goal is to limit the shared memory accesses between tasks to local thread as much as possible, and only when you absolutely have to communicate between threads do you reach out for the more expensive tools <code>mpsc</code> or <code>RwLock</code>. Your TCP connection needs to access multiple chat rooms that might live on different threads in a pool? <code>TcpStream</code> is <code>Send</code>, you can just <em>move it</em> to the thread on which a given room lives so that it's always local.</p>
<p>Not only does it make writing async code more pleasant because suddenly you don't need to worry about synchronization all the time, and you might even be able to use references (again, 🤯), this way of doing things even has a name: <strong>Thread-per-Core</strong> (or <strong>Thread/Core</strong>), and it's actually <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/introducing-glommio/">the far better model for writing performant servers</a>. And no, you don't necessarily need to buy into <a href="https://crates.io/crates/glommio">Glommio</a> with cooperative task programming, I hereby give you permission to still spawn blocking tasks on a separate thread-pool, it's okay.</p>
<p>Isn't all of this extra work? After all just calling <code>spawn</code> every time you need to do something in the background is pretty easy, right? Well, I suggest to you, dear reader, that this function signature:</p>
<pre><code><b>pub fn</b> <u>spawn</u>&lt;<i>T</i>&gt;(<i>future</i><b>:</b> <u>T</u>) -&gt; <i>JoinHandle</i>&lt;<i>T</i><b>::</b><u>Output</u>&gt; <b>where</b>
    <i>T</i><b>:</b> <u>Future</u> + <u>Send</u> + <b>'static</b>,
    <i>T</i><b>::</b><u>Output</u><b>:</b> <u>Send</u> + <b>'static</b>,
</code></pre>
<p>is a gun. We give it to all Rustaceans reaching for async, seasoned or new alike, and they all use it to repeatedly shoot themselves in the foot, over, and over, and over again, and most of the time they don't even know that's what they are doing. That's how easy to use it is.</p>
<p>Using multi-threaded <code>spawn</code> reduces the friction of managing multiple tasks across all CPU cores, and it only costs you <strong>friction everywhere else in your entire codebase</strong>, and quite often <strong>performance as well</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's stop.</p>
<p><sup id="n1">1)</sup> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/v8e9fa/local_async_executors_and_why_they_should_be_the/ibqbbzs/">u/SkiFire13 astutely noticed</a> that <code>Waker</code> must implement <code>Sync</code>, so this escape hatch is mostly relevant for environment such as embedded platforms or Wasm, where such constraint isn't an issue, and where atomics might be unavailable.</p>

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (December 4, 1995) -- Netscape Communications
Corporation (NASDAQ: NSCP) and Sun Microsystems, Inc. (NASDAQ:SUNW), today
announced JavaScript, an open, cross-platform object scripting language
for the creation and customization of applications on enterprise networks
and the Internet.  The JavaScript language complements Java, Sun's
industry-leading object-oriented, cross-platform programming language.  The
initial version of JavaScript is available now as part of the beta version
of Netscape Navigator 2.0, which is currently available for downloading
from Netscape's web site.
</p><p>
In addition, 28 industry-leading companies, including America Online, Inc.,
Apple Computer, Inc., Architext Software, Attachmate Corporation, AT&amp;T;,
Borland International, Brio Technology, Inc., Computer Associates, Inc.,
Digital Equipment Corporation, Hewlett-Packard Company, Iconovex
Corporation, Illustra Information Technologies, Inc., Informix Software,
Inc., Intuit, Inc., Macromedia, Metrowerks, Inc., Novell, Inc., Oracle
Corporation, Paper Software, Inc., Precept Software, Inc., RAD
Technologies, Inc., The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc., Silicon Graphics, Inc.,
Spider Technologies, Sybase, Inc., Toshiba Corporation, Verity, Inc., and
Vermeer Technologies, Inc., have endorsed JavaScript as an open
standard object scripting language and intend to provide it in future products.  The draft
specification of JavaScript, as well as the final draft specification of
Java, is planned for publishing and submission to appropriate standards
bodies for industry review and comment this month.
</p><p>
JavaScript is an easy-to-use object scripting language designed for
creating live online applications that link together objects and resources
on both clients and servers.  While Java is used by programmers to create
new objects and applets, JavaScript is designed for use by HTML page
authors and enterprise application developers to dynamically script the
behavior of objects running on either the client or the server.  JavaScript
is analogous to Visual Basic in that it can be used by people with little
or no programming experience to quickly construct complex applications.
JavaScript's design represents the next generation of software designed
specifically for the Internet and is:
</p><ul>
        <li>  designed for creating network-centric applications
        </li><li>  complementary to and integrated with Java
        </li><li>  complementary to and integrated with HTML
        </li><li>  open and cross-platform.
</li></ul>
Java, developed by Sun, is an object-oriented programming language that
operates independent of any operating system or microprocessor.  Java
programs called applets can be transmitted over a network and run on any
client, providing the multimedia richness of a CD-ROM over corporate
networks and the Internet.  Java has been widely hailed by programmers
because it eliminates the need to port applications, and by managers of
information systems for its potential to lower the costs of distributing
and maintaining applications across the network.

<p>
With JavaScript, an HTML page might contain an intelligent form that
performs loan payment or currency exchange calculations right on the client
in response to user input. A multimedia weather forecast applet written in
Java can be scripted by JavaScript to display appropriate images and sounds
based on the current weather readings in a region.  A server-side
JavaScript script might pull data out of a relational database and format
it in HTML on the fly.  A page might contain JavaScript scripts that run on
both the client and the server.  On the server, the scripts might
dynamically compose and format HTML content based on user preferences
stored in a relational database, and on the client, the scripts would glue
together an assortment of Java applets and HTML form elements into a live
interactive user interface for specifying a net-wide search for
information.
</p><p>
Java programs and JavaScript scripts are designed to run on both clients
and servers, with JavaScript scripts used to modify the properties and
behavior of Java objects, so the range of live online applications that
dynamically present information to and interact with users over enterprise
networks or the Internet is virtually unlimited.  Netscape will support
Java and JavaScript in client and server products as well as programming
tools and applications to make this vision a reality.
</p><p>
"Programmers have been overwhelmingly enthusiastic about Java because it
was designed from the ground up for the Internet.  JavaScript is a natural
fit, since it's also designed for the Internet and Unicode-based worldwide
use," said Bill Joy, co-founder and vice president of research at Sun.
"JavaScript will be the most effective method to connect HTML-based content
to Java applets."
</p><p>
Netscape's authoring and application development tools  -- Netscape
Navigator Gold 2.0, Netscape LiveWire and Netscape LiveWire Pro  -- are
designed for rapid development and deployment of JavaScript applications.
Netscape Navigator Gold 2.0 enables developers to create and edit
JavaScript scripts, while Netscape LiveWire enables JavaScript programs to
be installed, run and managed on Netscape servers, both within the
enterprise and across the Internet.  Netscape LiveWire Pro adds support for
JavaScript
connectivity to high-performance relational databases from Illustra,
Informix, Microsoft, Oracle and Sybase.  Java and JavaScript support are
being built into all Netscape products to provide a unified, front-to-back,
client/server/tool environment for building and deploying live online
applications.
</p><p>
Java is available to developers free of charge.  The Java Compiler and Java
Developer's Kit as well as the HotJava browser and related documentation
are available from Sun's web site at http://java.sun.com.  In addition, the
Java source code can be licensed for a fee.  Details on licensing are also
available via the java.sun.com web page.  To date, Sun has licensed Java to
a number of leading technology companies, including Borland, Macromedia,
Mitsubishi, Netscape, Oracle, Silicon Graphics, Spyglass, and Toshiba.
Sun's Workshop for Java toolkit is scheduled for release in Spring 1996.
Sun's NEO product family, the first complete development, operating and
management environment for object-oriented networked applications, will
also use Java-enabled browsers as front-ends to the NEO environment.
</p><p>
Netscape and Sun plan to propose JavaScript to the W3 Consortium (W3C) and
the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an open Internet scripting
language standard. JavaScript will be an open, freely licensed proposed
standard available to the entire Internet community.  Existing Sun Java
licensees will receive a license to JavaScript.  In addition, Sun and
Netscape intend to make a source code reference implementation of
JavaScript available for royalty-free licensing, further encouraging its
adoption as a standard in a wide variety of products.
</p><p>
Netscape Communications Corporation is a premier provider of open software
for linking people and information over enterprise networks and the
Internet.  The company offers a full line of Netscape Navigator clients,

          <h2>Creative limitations of existing generative AI Systems</h2>
          <p>
              Current generative AI systems such as Stable Diffusion (Image Generator) and ChatGPT (Large Language Model) excel at short-term general tasks through prompt engineering. However, they do not provide contextual guidance or intentionality to either a user or an automated generative story system (showrunner) as part of a long-term creative process which is often essential to producing high-quality creative works, especially in the context of existing IP's.
             </p>
        </div>



<div>
      <h3>Living with uncertainty</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          By using a multi-agent simulation as part of the process we can make use of data points such as a character's history, their goals and emotions, simulation events and localities to generate scenes and image assets more coherently and consistently aligned with the IP story world. The IP-based simulation also provides a clear, well known context to the user which allows them to judge the generated story more easily.
          Moreover, by allowing them to exert behavioral control over agents, observe their actions and engage in interactive conversations, the user's expectations and intentions are formed which we then funnel into a simple prompt to kick off the generation process.
          </p>
          <p>
       Our simulation is sufficiently complex and non-deterministic to favor a positive disconfirmation. Amplification effects can help mitigate what we consider an undesired "slot machine" effect which we'll briefly touch on later. We are used to watching episodes passively and the timespan between input and "end of scene/episode" discourages immediate judgment by the user and as a result reduces their desire to "retry". This disproportionality of the user's minimal input prompt and the resulting high-quality long-form output in the form of a full episode is a key factor for positive disconfirmation.
      </p>
      <p>
        While using and prompting a large language model as part of the process can introduce <i>"several challenges"</i>. Some of them, like hallucinations, which introduce uncertainty or in more creative terms "unexpectedness", can be regarded as creative side-effects to influence the expected story outcome in positive ways. As long as the randomness introduced by hallucination does not lead to implausible plot or agent behavior and the system can recover, they act as happy-accidents, a term often used during the creative process, further enhancing the user experience.

      </p>
  </div>
<br>
  <div>
    <h3>The Issue of 'The Slot Machine Effect' in current Generative AI tools</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        The Slot Machine Effect refers to a scenario where the <i>generation of AI-produced content feels more like a random game of chance rather than a deliberate creative process.</i> This is due to the often unpredictable and instantaneous nature of the generation process.

Current off-the-shelf generative AI systems do not support or encourage multiple creative evaluation steps in context of a long-term creative goal.
Their interfaces generally feature various settings, such as sliders and input fields which increase the level control and variability. The final output however, is generated almost instantaneously by the press of a button.
This instantaneous generation process results in immediate gratification providing a dopamine rush to the user. This reward mechanism would be generally helpful to sustain a multi-step creative process over long periods of time but current interfaces, the frequency of the reward and a lack of progression (stuck in an infinite loop) can lead to negative effects such as frustration, the intention-action gap or <i>a loss of control over the creative process.</i>
<i>The gap results from behavioral bias favoring immediate gratification</i>, which can be detrimental to long-term creative goals.
</p>
<p><img src="https://fablestudio.github.io/showrunner-agents/static/images/ui%20comparison%20copy.png" alt="Comparison of Interfaces: Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, Runway Gen-2"></p><p>
  While we do not directly solve these issues through interfaces, the contextualization of the process in a simulation and the above mentioned disproportionality and timespan between input and output help mitigate them. In addition we see opportunities in the simulation for in-character discriminators that participate in the creative evaluation process, such as an agent reflecting on the role they were assigned to or a scene they should perform in.
</p>
<p>
  The multi-step "trial and error" process of the generative story system is not presented to the user, therefore it doesn't allow for intervention or judgment, avoiding the negative effects of immediate gratification through a user's "accept or reject" decisions. It does not matter to the user experience how often the AI system has to retry different prompt chains as long as the generation process is not negatively perceived as idle time but integrated seamlessly with the simulation gameplay. 
  The user only acts as the discriminator in the very end of the process after having watched the generated scene or episode. This is also an opportunity to utilize the concept of Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback (RLHF) for improving the multi-step creative process and as a result the automatically generated episode.
  </p>

          <h2>Large Language Models</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              LLMs represent the forefront of natural language processing and machine learning research, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. They are typically built on Transformer-based architectures, a class of models that rely on self-attention mechanisms. Transformers allow for efficient use of computational resources, enabling the training of significantly larger language models. GPT-4, for instance, comprises billions of parameters that are trained on extensive datasets, effectively encoding a substantial quantity of worldly knowledge in their weights.
            <br>
            </p><p><img src="https://fablestudio.github.io/showrunner-agents/static/images/The-Transformer-model-architecture%20(1).png" alt="">
            </p>
            <p>

          Central to the functioning of these LLMs is the concept of vector embeddings. These are mathematical representations of words or phrases in a high-dimensional space. These embeddings capture the semantic relationships between words, such that words with similar meanings are located close to each other in the embedding space. In the case of LLMs, each word in the model's vocabulary is initially represented as a dense vector, also known as an embedding. These vectors are adjusted during the training process, and their final values, or "embeddings", represent the learned relationships between words.
          During training, the model learns to predict the next word in a sentence by adjusting the embeddings and other parameters to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual words. The embeddings thus reflect the model's understanding of words and their context. Moreover, because Transformers can attend to any word in a sentence regardless of its position, the model can form a more comprehensive understanding of the meaning of a sentence. This is a significant advancement over older models that could only consider words in a limited window. The combination of vector embeddings and Transformer-based architectures in LLMs facilitates a deep and nuanced understanding of language, which is why these models can generate such high-quality, human-like text.
          </p>
            
              <p><img src="https://fablestudio.github.io/showrunner-agents/static/images/vector_embedding.png" alt=""></p><p>

          <br>
          As was mentioned previously, transformer-based language models excel at short-term general tasks. They are regarded as fast-thinkers. [Kahneman].
          Fast thinking pertains to instinctive, automatic, and often heuristic-based decision-making, while slow thinking involves deliberate, analytical, and effortful processes. LLMs generate responses swiftly based on patterns learned from training data, without the capacity for introspection or understanding the underlying logic behind their outputs. However, this also implies that LLMs lack the ability to deliberate, reason deeply, or learn from singular experiences in the way that slow-thinking entities, such as humans, can. While these models have made remarkable strides in text generation tasks, their fast-thinking nature may limit their potential in tasks requiring deep comprehension or flexible reasoning. 
          More recent approaches to imitate slow-thinking capabilities such as prompt-chaining (see Auto-GPT) showed promising results. Large language models seem powerful enough to act as their own discriminator in a multi-step process. <i>This can dramatically improve the ability to reason in different contexts, such as solving math problems.</i>
        <br>
              
              We make heavy use of GPT-4 to influence the agents in the simulation as well as generating the scenes for the south park episode. 
              Since transcriptions of most of the south park episodes are part of GPT-4's training dataset, it already has a good understanding of the character's personalities, talking style as well as overall humor of the show, eliminating the need for a custom fine-tuned model.
            <br>   
            However, we do imitate slow-thinking as part of a multi-step creative process. For this we use different prompt chains to compare and evaluate the events of different scenes and how they progress the overall story towards a satisfactory, IP-aligned result.
            Our attempt to generate episodes through prompt-chaining is due to the fact that story generation is a highly discontinuous task. <i>These are tasks where the content generation cannot be done in a gradual or continuous way, but instead requires a certain ”Eureka” idea that accounts for a discontinuous leap in the progress towards the solution of the task. The content generation involves discovering or inventing a new way of looking at or framing the problem, that enables the generation of the rest of the content. Examples of discontinuous tasks are solving a math problem that requires a novel or creative application of a formula, writing a joke or a riddle, coming up with a scientific hypothesis or a philosophical argument, or creating a new genre or style of writing.</i>
            </p>
            <h3>Diffusion models
            </h3><p>

            Diffusion models operate on the principle of gradually adding or removing random noise from data over time to generate or reconstruct an output. The image starts as random noise and, over many steps, gradually transforms into a coherent picture, or vice versa. 
          <br>
            <img src="https://fablestudio.github.io/showrunner-agents/static/images/strip_00000_1.png" alt="Image strip of a diffusion model generating a south park background">


            In order to train our custom diffusion models, we collected a comprehensive dataset comprising approximately 1200 characters and 600 background images from the TV show South Park. This dataset serves as the raw material from which our models learned the style of the show. 
        <br>
        To train these models, we employ Dream Booth.
The result of this training phase is the creation of two specialized diffusion models. 
 
<br>
The first model is dedicated to generating single characters set against a keyable background color. This facilitates the extraction of the generated character for subsequent processing and animation, allowing us to seamlessly integrate newly generated characters into a variety of scenes and settings. In addition, the character diffusion model allows the user to create a south park character based on their own looks via the image-to-image process of stable diffusion and then join the simulation as an equally participating agent. With the ability to clone their own voice, it's easy to imagine a fully realized autonomous character based on the user's characteristic looks, writing style and voice.
</p><p><img src="https://fablestudio.github.io/showrunner-agents/static/images/edward_southpark.png" alt="Summary of our findings">

</p>

<p>


The second model is trained to generate clean backgrounds, with a particular focus on both exterior and interior environments. This model provides the 'stage' upon which our generated characters can interact, allowing for a wide range of potential scenes and scenarios to be created.
</p><p><img src="https://fablestudio.github.io/showrunner-agents/static/images/stable_diffusion_background_exterior.png" alt="Summary of our findings">
  <img src="https://fablestudio.github.io/showrunner-agents/static/images/stable_diffusion_background_interior.png" alt="Summary of our findings">
</p><p>

However, it's important to note that the images produced by these models are inherently limited in their resolution due to the pixel-based nature of the output. To circumvent this limitation, we post-process the generated images using an AI upscaling technique, specifically R-ESRGAN-4x+-Anime6B, which refines and enhances the image quality.
</p><p><img src="https://fablestudio.github.io/showrunner-agents/static/images/vector_graphics-gpt4.png" alt="Example of a GPT-4 drawn TiKZ vector shape representing a unicorn">
</p>
<p>
For future 2D interactive work, training custom transformer based models that are capable of generating vector-based output would have several advantages. Unlike pixel-based images, vector graphics do not lose quality when resized or zoomed, thus offering the potential for infinite resolution. This will enable us to generate images that retain their quality and detail regardless of the scale at which they are viewed. Furthermore, vector based shapes are already separated into individual parts, solving pixel-based post-processing issues with transparency and segmentation which complicate the integration of generated assets into procedural world building and animation systems.</p><p><img src="https://fablestudio.github.io/showrunner-agents/static/images/vector%20gpt%204%20copy.png" alt="Example of a house and a street drawn by GPT-4 in SVG">

      <h2>Episode Generation</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          We define an episode as a sequence of dialogue scenes in specific locations which add up to a total runtime of a regular 22 min south park episode.
<br>

</p><p>
  In order to generate a full south park episode, we prompt the story system with a high level idea, usually in the form of a title, synopsis and major events we want to see happen over the course of 1 week in simulation time (=roughly 3 hours of play time).

</p>
<p>
  From this, the story system automatically extrapolates up to 14 scenes by making use of simulation data as part of a prompt chain. The showrunner system takes care of casting the characters for each scene and how the story should progress through a plot pattern. Each scene is associated with a plot letter (e.g. A, B, C) which is then used by the showrunner to alternate between different character groups and follow their individual storylines over the course of an episode to keep the user engaged.

</p>
<p>
  In the end, each scene simply defines the location, cast and dialogue for each cast member.
The scene is played back according to the plot pattern (e.g. ABABC) after the staging system and AI camera system went through initial setup. The voice of each character has been cloned in advance and voice clips are generated on the fly for every new dialogue line.

    <h3>Reducing Latency</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        In our experiments, generating a single scene can take a significant amount of time of up to one minute. Below is a response time comparison between GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4. 
        Speed will increase in the short-term as models and service infrastructure get improved and other factors like artificial throttling due to high user demand will get removed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we generate the episodes during gameplay, we have ways to hide most of the generation time in moments when the user is still interacting with the simulation or other user interfaces. Another way to reduce the time needed to generate a scene or episode is to use faster models such as GPT-3.5-turbo for specific prompts in the chain where the highest quality and accuracy is not so important.

      </p>

<p>
  During scene playback, we avoid any unwanted pauses between dialogue lines related to audio generation by using a simple buffering system which generates at least one voice clip in advance. This means while one character is delivering their voice clip, we already make the web request for the next voice clip, wait for it to generate, download the file and then wait for the current speaker to finish his dialogue before playback (delay). In this way the next dialogue line's voice clip is always delivered without any delay. Text generation and voice cloning services become increasingly fast and allow for highly adaptive and near-real time voice conversations.

<h3>Simulate creative thinking</h3>

<p>
  As stated earlier, the data produced by the simulation acts as creative fuel to both, the user who is writing the initial prompt and the generative story system which is interacting with the LLM via prompt-chaining.
Prompt-chaining is a technique, which involves supplying the language model with a sequence of related prompts to simulate a continuous thought process. Sometimes it can take on different roles in each step to act as the discriminator against the previous prompt and generated result.
</p><p>  


In our case we try to mimic that of a discontinuous creative thought process.
</p><p>

  For example, the creation of 14 distinct South Park scenes could be managed by initially providing a broad prompt to outline the general narrative, followed by specific prompts detailing and evaluating each scene's cast, location, and key plot points. This mimics the process of human brainstorming, where ideas are built upon and refined in multiple often discontinuous steps. By leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs in conjunction with the iterative refinement offered by prompt-chaining, we can effectively construct a dynamic, detailed, and engaging narrative. 
</p>

<p>
  In addition, we explore new concepts like plot patterns and dramatic operators (DrOps) to enhance the episode structure overall but also the connective tissue between each scene. Stylistic devices like reversals, foreshadowing, cliffhangers are difficult to evaluate as part of a prompt chain. A user without a writing background would have equal difficulty in judging these stylistic devices for their effectiveness and proper placement. We propose a procedural approach, injecting these show specific patterns and stylistic devices into the prompt chain programmatically as plot patterns and DrOps which can operate on the level of act structures, scene structures and individual dialogue lines. We are investigating future opportunities to extract what we call a dramatic fingerprint which is specific to each IP and format and train our custom SHOW-1 model with these data points. This dataset combined with overall human feedback could further align tone, style and entertainment value between the user and the specified IP while offering a highly adaptive and interactive story system as part of the on-going simulation.

<h3>Blank page problem
</h3>

<p>
  As mentioned above, one of the advantages of the simulation is that it avoids the blank page problem for both a user and a large language model by providing creative fuel. Even experienced writers can sometimes feel overwhelmed when asked to come up with a title or story idea without any prior incubation of related material. The same could be said for LLMs. The simulation provides context and data points before starting the creative prompt chain.
    </p>
   

    <h3>Who is driving the story?
    </h3>
    
    <div><p>
      The story generation process in our approach is a shared responsibility between the simulation, the user, and GPT-4. Each has strengths and weaknesses and a unique role to play depending on how much we want to involve them in the overall creative process. Their contributions can have different weights. While the simulation usually provides the foundational IP-based context, character histories, emotions, events, and localities that seed the initial creative process. The user introduces their intentionality, exerts behavioral control over the agents and provides the initial prompts that kick off the generative process. The user also serves as the final discriminator, evaluating the generated story content at the end of the process. GPT-4, on the other hand, serves as the main generative engine, creating and extrapolating the scenes and dialogue based on the prompts it receives from both the user and the simulation. It's a symbiotic process where the strengths of each participant contribute to a coherent, engaging story. Importantly, our multi-step approach in the form of a prompt-chain also provides checks and balances, mitigating the potential for unwanted randomness and allowing for more consistent alignment with the IP story world.

        <h3>SHOW-1 and Intentionality
        </h3>
        
        <p>
          The formular (creative characteristics) and format (technical characteristics) of a show are often a function of real-world limitations and production processes. They usually don't change, even over the course of many seasons (South Park currently has 26 seasons and 325 episodes) 

        </p>
        <p>
          A single dramatic fingerprint of a show, which is used to train the proposed SHOW-1 model, can be regarded as a highly variable template or "formula"  for a procedural generator that produces South Park-like episodes.
        </p>
        <p>
          To train a model such as SHOW-1 we need to gather a sufficient amount of data points in relation to each other that characterize a show. A TV show does not just come into existence and is made up of the final dialogue lines and set descriptions as seen by the audience. Existing datasets on which current LLM's are trained on only consist of the final screenplay which has the cast, dialogue lines and sometimes a short scene header. A lot of information is missing, such as timing, emotional states, themes, contexts discussed in the writer's room and detailed directorial notes to give a few examples. The development and refinement of characters is also part of this on-going process. Fictional characters have personalities, backstories and daily routines which help authors to sculpt not only scenes but the arcs of whole seasons. Even during a show characters keep evolving based on audience feedback or changes in creative direction. With the Simulation, we can gather data continuously from both the user's input and the simulated agents. Over time, as episodes are created, refined and rated by the user we can start to train a show specific model and deploy it as a checkpoint which allows the user to continue to refine and iterate on either their own original show or alternatively push an already existing show such as south park into directions previously not conceived by the original show runners and IP holders. To illustrate this, we imagine a user generating multiple south park episodes in which Cartman, one of the main characters and known for his hot headedness, slowly changes to be shy and naive while the life of other characters such as Butters could be tuned to follow a much more dominant and aggressive path. Over time, this feedback loop of interacting with and fine-tuning the SHOW-1 model can lead to new interpretations of existing shows but more excitingly to new original shows based on the user's intention. One of the challenges in order to make this feedback loop engaging and satisfying is the frequency at which a model can be trained. A model which is fed by real-time simulation data and user input should not feel static or require expensive resources to adapt. Otherwise the output it generates can feel static and unresponsive as well.
        </p>
         <p>
          When a generative system is not limited in its ability to swiftly produce high amounts of content and there is no limit for the user to consume such content immediately and potentially simultaneously, the 10,000 Bowls of Oatmeal problem can become an issue. Everything starts to look and feel the same or even worse, the user starts to recognize a pattern which in turn reduces their engagement as they expect newly generated episodes to be like the ones before it, without any surprises.

         </p>
         <p>
          This is quite different from a predictable plot which in combination with the above mentioned "positive hallucinations" or happy accidents of a complex generative system can be a good thing. Surprising the user by balancing and changing the phases of certainty vs. uncertainty helps increase their overall engagement. If they would not expect or predict anything, they could also not get pleasantly surprised.
         </p>

         <p>
          With our work we aim for perceptual uniqueness. The OatMeal problem of procedural generators is mitigated by making use of an on-going simulation (a hidden generator) and the long-form content of 22 min episodes which are only generated every 3h. This way the user generally does not consume a high quantity of content simultaneously or in a very short amount of time. This artificial scarcity, natural game play limits and simulation time help.


         </p>
         <p>
          Another factor that keeps audiences engaged while watching a show and what makes episodes unique is intentionality from the authors. A satirical moral premise, twisted social commentary, recent world events or cameos by celebrities are major elements for South Park. Other show types, for example sitcoms, usually progress mainly through changes in relationship (some of which are never fulfilled), keeping the audience hooked despite following the same format and formula. 
         </p>

         <p>
          Intentionality from the user to generate a high-quality episode is another area of internal research. Even users without a background in dramatic writing should be able to come up with stories, themes or major dramatic questions they want to see played out within the simulation.
          <br>
          To support this, the showrunner system could guide the user by sharing its own creative thought process and make encouraging suggestions or prompting the user by asking the right questions. A sort of reversed prompt engineering where the user is answering questions.
         </p>

         <p>
          One of the remaining unanswered questions in the context of intentionality is how much entertainment value (or overall creative value) is directly attributed to the creative personas of living authors and directors. Big names usually drive ticket sales but the creative credit the audience gives to the work while consuming it seems different. 
Watching a Disney movie certainly carries with it a sense of creative quality, regardless of famous voice actors, as a result of brand attachment and its history.

         </p>

         <p>
          AI generated content is generally perceived as lower quality and the fact that it can get generated in abundance further decreases its value. How much this perception would change if Disney were to openly pride themselves on having produced a fully AI generated movie is hard to say. What if Steven Spielberg, single handedly generated an AI movie? Our assumption is that the perceived value of AI generated content would certainly increase.

         </p>
         <p>
          A new interesting approach to replicate this could be the embodiment of creative AI models such as SHOW-1 to allow them to build a persona outside their simulated world and build relationships via social media or real world events with their audience. As long as an AI model is perceived as a black box and does not share their creative process and reasoning in a human and accessible way, as is the case for living writers and directors, it's unlikely to get credit with real creative values. However, for now this is a more philosophical question in the context of AGI.
         </p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              Our approach of using multi-agent simulation and large language models for generating high-quality episodic content provides a novel and effective solution to many of the limitations of current AI systems in creative storytelling. By integrating the strengths of the simulation, the user, and the AI model, we provide a rich, interactive, and engaging storytelling experience that is consistently aligned with the IP story world. Our method also mitigates issues such as the 'slot machine effect', 'the oatmeal problem' and 'blank page problem' that plague conventional generative AI systems. As we continue to refine this approach, we are confident that we can further enhance the quality of the generated content, the user experience, and the creative potential of generative AI systems in storytelling.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Elevator Pitch</h2>
<p dir="auto">Rant time: You've heard it before, git is <em>powerful</em>, but what good is that power when everything is so damn hard to do? Interactive rebasing requires you to edit a goddamn TODO file in your editor? <em>Are you kidding me?</em> To stage part of a file you need to use a command line program to step through each hunk and if a hunk can't be split down any further but contains code you don't want to stage, you have to edit an arcane patch file <em>by hand</em>? <em>Are you KIDDING me?!</em> Sometimes you get asked to stash your changes when switching branches only to realise that after you switch and unstash that there weren't even any conflicts and it would have been fine to just checkout the branch directly? <em>YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!</em></p>
<p dir="auto">If you're a mere mortal like me and you're tired of hearing how powerful git is when in your daily life it's a powerful pain in your ass, lazygit might be for you.</p>

<p dir="auto">Please note:
If you get an error claiming that lazygit cannot be found or is not defined, you
may need to add <code>~/go/bin</code> to your $PATH (MacOS/Linux), or <code>%HOME%\go\bin</code>
(Windows). Not to be mistaken for <code>C:\Go\bin</code> (which is for Go's own binaries,
not apps like lazygit).</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Chocolatey (Windows)</h3>
<p dir="auto">You can install <code>lazygit</code> using <a href="https://chocolatey.org/" rel="nofollow">Chocolatey</a>:</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Manual</h3>
<p dir="auto">You'll need to <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install" rel="nofollow">install Go</a></p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit.git
cd lazygit
go install"><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit.git
cd lazygit
go install
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can also use <code>go run main.go</code> to compile and run in one go (pun definitely intended)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<p dir="auto">Call <code>lazygit</code> in your terminal inside a git repository.</p>

<p dir="auto">If you want, you can
also add an alias for this with <code>echo "alias lg='lazygit'" &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc</code> (or
whichever rc file you're using).</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Keybindings</h3>
<p dir="auto">You can check out the list of keybindings <a href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/keybindings">here</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Changing Directory On Exit</h3>
<p dir="auto">If you change repos in lazygit and want your shell to change directory into that repo on exiting lazygit, add this to your <code>~/.zshrc</code> (or other rc file):</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="lg()
{
    export LAZYGIT_NEW_DIR_FILE=~/.lazygit/newdir

    lazygit &quot;$@&quot;

    if [ -f $LAZYGIT_NEW_DIR_FILE ]; then
            cd &quot;$(cat $LAZYGIT_NEW_DIR_FILE)&quot;
            rm -f $LAZYGIT_NEW_DIR_FILE > /dev/null
    fi
}"><pre><code>lg()
{
    export LAZYGIT_NEW_DIR_FILE=~/.lazygit/newdir

    lazygit "$@"

    if [ -f $LAZYGIT_NEW_DIR_FILE ]; then
            cd "$(cat $LAZYGIT_NEW_DIR_FILE)"
            rm -f $LAZYGIT_NEW_DIR_FILE &gt; /dev/null
    fi
}
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then <code>source ~/.zshrc</code> and from now on when you call <code>lg</code> and exit you'll switch directories to whatever you were in inside lazygit. To override this behaviour you can exit using <code>shift+Q</code> rather than just <code>q</code>.</p>

                        <li>This hiring-based criteria no longer fits with Mark Zuckerberg's ongoing 'efficiency' mandate.</li>
                        <li>Managers were recently told promotions will be less frequent.</li>
                        </ul><p>Managers at Meta looking for a promotion in the next year or two may be stuck where they are as the company continues to change under a new era of austerity.</p><p>Maher Saba, head of engineering and remote presence at Meta, formerly known as Facebook, last week told managers there would be new criteria that will make it harder for them to rise up the ranks, according to three people familiar with the company.</p><p>Company executives have been working in recent months to comply with a mandate from founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to streamline operations as he declared 2023 Meta's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-year-efficiency-meta-facebook-could-mean-more-layoffs-2023-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Year of Efficiency</a>. Saba is seen as a keen enforcer of a new culture of "<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-job-cuts-meta-increased-intensity-2022-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">intensity</a>," having told managers last year that they need to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-engineering-head-tells-managers-to-find-underperformers-2022-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">weed out underperformers</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Efficiency at Meta has meant <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-earnings-mark-zuckerberg-metaverse-spending-cost-cutting-2023-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">months</a> of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-backs-off-plans-retail-stores-amid-ongoing-cost-cutting-2023-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">cutting costs</a>, "<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-vps-leave-ahead-of-thousands-more-layoffs-2023-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">flattening</a>" <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-is-reorganizing-facebook-to-be-like-instagram-amid-further-layoffs-2023-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">organizational structures</a>, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-meta-layoffs-second-round-job-cuts-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">layoffs</a>, with more than 20,000 people losing their jobs since November. Headcount is now down to about 65,000 employees from nearly 90,000 at its peak in mid-2022. In a March post regarding layoffs, Zuckerberg noted interest rates and market volatility created a need for a more austere attitude. "We should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years," he said.</p><p>In an effort to maintain Meta's new, flatter structure, Saba said promotions <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-industry-fake-work-problem-bad-managers-bosses-layoffs-jobs-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">within management</a> levels at Meta will be based less on team size going forward and that manager promotions will also be less frequent, two people familiar with the changes said. The comments were made in an internal Workplace forum for engineering managers. A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment.</p><p>With an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-hiring-freeze-meta-layoffs-mark-zuckerberg-2022-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">ongoing slowdown in hiring</a> at the company, managers will simply not be able to hire as much as they have in previous years. Saba's note came about three weeks after Meta's performance review cycle for the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-lowers-bonus-payouts-reverts-bi-annual-performance-reviews-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">first half of the year</a> was completed, a time which can often lead to expectations for promotions and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-lowers-bonus-payouts-reverts-bi-annual-performance-reviews-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">bonuses</a> among employees who received positive reviews.</p><p>In a post to the app Blind, in a group only accessible to Meta employees, a worker said Saba's note meant there would be "no manager growth for 2-3 years." Another worker commented that taking away team size as a promotion metric means "a manager's career is just up to their ability to navigate politics from now on."</p><p>Moving away from hiring incentives for management is needed at the company, according to a high-level employee who recently left Meta. "It's been a long time coming," the person said. The person noted that Meta's criteria for promotions within management have been so reliant on hiring that "it was harder to get promoted if you didn't meet the right size ratios, even if you had good product or business impact."</p><p>It's a 180-degree turn for Meta, which spent years in hyper-growth mode and "rigorously supported" hiring-based promotion criteria, the person added. For example, to become an engineering manager a person had to show they previously "accumulated" the right size team as a high-level engineer, as Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-snap-employees-brace-for-another-round-of-layoffs-2023-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">previously reported</a>. To move from a manager title to a director role, a person had to have hired managers under them from outside the company. To move up the director ranks, a person needed to have managed their own team of directors. All of that meant more hiring, the former employee explained.&nbsp;</p><p>Such incentives resulted in widespread "bloat" at the company, which for years wanted to show Wall Street it was a growing organization through ever-increasing employee numbers. As investors decided last year profits were more important than growth, management ranks became a target for Zuckerberg. He said early this year he no longer wanted his company to be one of "managers managing managers"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, Meta <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-vps-leave-ahead-of-thousands-more-layoffs-2023-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">eliminated</a> many <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-is-downranking-manager-roles-ahead-of-expected-layoffs-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">manager roles</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-managers-are-being-demoted-compete-with-former-reports-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">moved down</a> many existing managers to individual contributor roles, and overall&nbsp; "flattened" its organizational structure to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-is-reorganizing-facebook-to-be-like-instagram-amid-further-layoffs-2023-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">remove layers</a> of management. The new decision to promote fewer managers will make the reduction in Meta's management ranks more permanent.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Are you a Meta employee or someone else with insight to share?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Fira Code: free monospaced font with programming ligatures</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/blob/master/extras/logo.svg"><img src="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/raw/master/extras/logo.svg" alt="Fira Code"></a></p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Problem</h3>
<p dir="auto">Programmers use a lot of symbols, often encoded with several characters. For the human brain, sequences like <code>-&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code> or <code>:=</code> are single logical tokens, even if they take two or three characters on the screen. Your eye spends a non-zero amount of energy to scan, parse and join multiple characters into a single logical one. Ideally, all programming languages should be designed with full-fledged Unicode symbols for operators, but that’s not the case yet.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Solution</h3>
<p dir="auto">Fira Code is a free monospaced font containing ligatures for common programming multi-character combinations. This is just a font rendering feature: underlying code remains ASCII-compatible. This helps to read and understand code faster. For some frequent sequences like <code>..</code> or <code>//</code>, ligatures allow us to correct spacing.</p>

<p dir="auto">Fira Code comes with a huge variety of arrows. Even better: you can make them as long as you like and combine start/middle/end fragments however you want!</p>

<p dir="auto">Fira Code is not only about ligatures. Some fine-tuning is done for punctuation and frequent letter pairs.</p>

<p dir="auto">Fira Code comes with a few different character variants (<code>cv01</code>, <code>cv02</code>, etc), stylistic sets (<code>ss01</code>, <code>ss02</code> , etc) and other font features (<code>zero</code>, <code>onum</code>, <code>calt</code>, etc), so that everyone can choose what’s best for them. <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/How-to-enable-stylistic-sets">How to enable</a></p>

<p dir="auto">Some ligatures can be altered or enabled using stylistic sets/character variants:</p>

<p dir="auto">Being a programming font, Fira Code has fantastic support for ASCII/box drawing, powerline and other forms of console UIs:</p>

<p dir="auto">Fira Code is the first programming font to offer dedicated glyphs to render progress bars:</p>

<p dir="auto">We hope more programming fonts will adopt this convention and ship their own versions.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unicode coverage makes Fira Code a great choice for mathematical writing:</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building Fira Code locally</h3>
<p dir="auto">In case you want to alter FiraCode.glyphs and build OTF/TTF/WOFF files yourself, this is the setup I use on macOS:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# install all required build tools
./script/bootstrap_macos.sh

# build the font files
./script/build.sh

# install OTFs to ~/Library/Fonts
cp distr/otf/*.otf ~/Library/Fonts"><pre><span><span>#</span> install all required build tools</span>
./script/bootstrap_macos.sh

<span><span>#</span> build the font files</span>
./script/build.sh

<span><span>#</span> install OTFs to ~/Library/Fonts</span>
cp distr/otf/<span>*</span>.otf <span>~</span>/Library/Fonts</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, you can build Fira Code using Docker:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# install dependencies in a container and build the font files
make

# package the font files from dist/ into a zip
make package"><pre><span><span>#</span> install dependencies in a container and build the font files</span>
make

<span><span>#</span> package the font files from dist/ into a zip</span>
make package</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you want to <em>permanently enable</em> certain style sets or character variations, maybe because your editor of choice does not allow you to toggle these individually, you can provide the desired features as a comma separated list to the build script via the <code>-f / --features</code> flag.<br>Default: none.</p>
<p dir="auto">To separate different versions of your font you can specify the desired font family name with the <code>-n / --family-name</code> flag. The special value 'features' will append a sorted, space separated list of enabled features to the default family name.<br>Default: "Fira Code"</p>
<p dir="auto">You can also limit the font weights that will be created with the <code>-w / --weights</code> option.<br>Default: "Light,Regular,Retina,Medium,SemiBold,Bold"</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# locally in your shell
./script/build.sh --features &quot;ss02,ss08,ss10,cv03,cv07,cv14&quot; --family-name &quot;Fira Code straight&quot; --weights &quot;Regular,Bold&quot;

# or via a docker container (creates the family name 'Fira Code cv01 cv02 cv06 cv31 onum ss01 ss03 ss04 zero')

            <span>Abstract:</span>  GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are the two most widely used large language model (LLM)
services. However, when and how these models are updated over time is opaque.
Here, we evaluate the March 2023 and June 2023 versions of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on
four diverse tasks: 1) solving math problems, 2) answering sensitive/dangerous
questions, 3) generating code and 4) visual reasoning. We find that the
performance and behavior of both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can vary greatly over time.
For example, GPT-4 (March 2023) was very good at identifying prime numbers
(accuracy 97.6%) but GPT-4 (June 2023) was very poor on these same questions
(accuracy 2.4%). Interestingly GPT-3.5 (June 2023) was much better than GPT-3.5
(March 2023) in this task. GPT-4 was less willing to answer sensitive questions
in June than in March, and both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 had more formatting mistakes
in code generation in June than in March. Overall, our findings shows that the
behavior of the same LLM service can change substantially in a relatively short
amount of time, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring of LLM quality.

					<article itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><div itemprop="text"><p><span>“Infosec twitter” has been used to describe the vibrant, active and often enthusiastic community of security practitioners working in and around the industry. It’s been a source of insight, inspiration and entertainment for many and for years. Therefore, it is with a bit of sadness that I must announce that the death of infosec twitter is upon us.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Two years ago, on July 12th, 2021, we saved our first bit of data from twitter recording tweets with discussions of CVEs on twitter. I had been researching and studying vulnerabilities for several years and our work on EPSS was in full swing. We started collecting vulnerability discussions to see what kind of benefit that data could add to the EPSS approach. Plus, CVE identifiers are relatively easy to search on and pick out from conversation, so we could be relatively confident we were collecting every tweet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On July 12th, 2021, we recorded 1,161 original and unique tweets (no retweets) that were discussing CVEs, and we tracked tweets with CVEs every day from that point on. There is certainly an ebb and flow to the discussions and definitely a “weekend effect” with weekdays seeing an average of 1,272 tweets per day during the week and 463 tweets per day on the weekend.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Elon Musk’s purchase of twitter was official on October 27th, 2022 and he </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-start-layoffs-friday-morning-internal-email-2022-11-04/"><span>laid off half of their employees</span></a><span> a few days later on November 4th, 2022. We saw several prominent voices leave the platform, but honestly we could not see any noticeable shift in infosec twitter over the next three months. Incidentally, I tried to capture “notable events” in the twitter timeline but there were far too many with several headlines every week to pick from. I am definitely missing the majority of headlines here, but I did toss in when the “Trust and Safety Council” was dissolved.</span></p>

<p><span>So where does the death of infosec twitter happen?&nbsp; My best estimate is around the end of April or early May. Take a look (I shifted the date range here to focus mainly on the post-Elon era):</span></p>

<p><span>Over the last 3 weeks of our data (June 21 to July 12, 2023), we saw a </span><i><span>weekday</span></i><span> daily tweet count drop from the 1,272 pre-Elon average to just 333 tweets a day, which is about a 74% drop in weekday tweets. The 2-week rolling average (including weekends) dropped down to 272 tweets over the final 2 weeks. When I attempt to remove automated CVE announcements (bots), the drop is even more significant, dropping from over 500 a day down to 66 over the last two weeks, an 87% decrease in CVE-related tweets.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately this is where the story will stop too. The free tier we were using to collect this data was cut off last week. Between the headlines and the trend we are seeing in this data, it just doesn’t make sense to pay for access to this data. The last day we were able to save twitter data was July 12th, 2023, exactly two years from the start of our experiment. And with that, we say “so long” to infosec twitter.</span></p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Elevator Pitch</h2>
<p dir="auto">Minor rant incoming: Something's not working? Maybe a service is down. <code>docker-compose ps</code>. Yep, it's that microservice that's still buggy. No issue, I'll just restart it: <code>docker-compose restart</code>. Okay now let's try again. Oh wait the issue is still there. Hmm. <code>docker-compose ps</code>. Right so the service must have just stopped immediately after starting. I probably would have known that if I was reading the log stream, but there is a lot of clutter in there from other services. I could get the logs for just that one service with <code>docker compose logs --follow myservice</code> but that dies everytime the service dies so I'd need to run that command every time I restart the service. I could alternatively run <code>docker-compose up myservice</code> and in that terminal window if the service is down I could just <code>up</code> it again, but now I've got one service hogging a terminal window even after I no longer care about its logs. I guess when I want to reclaim the terminal realestate I can do <code>ctrl+P,Q</code>, but... wait, that's not working for some reason. Should I use ctrl+C instead? I can't remember if that closes the foreground process or kills the actual service.</p>
<p dir="auto">What a headache!</p>
<p dir="auto">Memorising docker commands is hard. Memorising aliases is slightly less hard. Keeping track of your containers across multiple terminal windows is near impossible. What if you had all the information you needed in one terminal window with every common command living one keypress away (and the ability to add custom commands as well). Lazydocker's goal is to make that dream a reality.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How do I edit my config?</h3>
<p dir="auto">By opening lazydocker, clicking on the 'project' panel in the top left, and pressing 'o' (or 'e' if your editor is vim). See <a href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/blob/master/docs/Config.md">Config Docs</a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How do I get text to wrap in my main panel?</h3>
<p dir="auto">In the future I want to make this the default, but for now there are some CPU issues that arise with wrapping. If you want to enable wrapping, use <code>gui.wrapMainPanel: true</code></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How do you select text?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Because we support mouse events, you will need to hold option while dragging the mouse to indicate you're trying to select text rather than click on something. Alternatively you can disable mouse events via the <code>gui.ignoreMouseEvents</code> config value.</p>
<p dir="auto">Mac Users: See <a href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/issues/190" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/jesseduffield/lazydocker/issues/190/hovercard">Issue #190</a> for other options.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why can't I see my container's logs?</h3>
<p dir="auto">By default we only show logs from the last hour, so that we're not putting too much strain on the machine. This may be why you can't see logs when you first start lazydocker. This can be overwritten in the config's <code>commandTemplates</code></p>
<p dir="auto">If you are running lazydocker in Docker container, it is a know bug, that you can't see logs or CPU usage.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why isn't my docker-compose environment being used?</h3>
<p dir="auto">By default Compose V1 (<code>docker-compose</code> with the hyphen) is used as the docker-compose command. You will need to make sure you have the <code>docker-compose</code> command available for lazydocker to be able to use.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you use Compose V2 (<code>docker compose</code> without the hyphen), alternatively, you can change the docker-compose command used via the <code>commandTemplates.dockerCompose</code> config value.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Alternatives</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/skanehira/docui">docui</a> - Skanehira beat me to the punch on making a docker terminal UI, so definitely check out that repo as well! I think the two repos can live in harmony though: lazydocker is more about managing existing containers/services, and docui is more about creating and configuring them.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/portainer/portainer">Portainer</a> - Portainer tries to solve the same problem but it's accessed via your browser rather than your terminal. It also supports docker swarm.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker/blob/master/README.md#terminal">Awesome Docker list</a> for similar tools to work with Docker.</li>

Companies with flexible work policies are growing more quickly than those that require people to be in the office full-time, according to <a href="https://bit.ly/3NPcx7h" target="_blank">The Flex Index</a>, released July 18, which collects office requirements on more than 4,500 companies with 30,000 locations and that employ more than 100 million people globally.</p>                  <p>Specifically, in the last year, companies—regardless of their size—that are fully flexible added jobs at more than twice the rate of companies that were full-time in office.</p>                                    <hr>                  <h3>More from TIME</h3>                    
                  <hr>                  <p>“It seems pretty clear that the companies that are full time in-office are having a harder time attracting talent than the companies that offer some level of flexibility,” says Rob Sadow, CEO and co-founder of Scoop, the technology company that publishes the report.</p>                                                      <p>Even companies that offer some level of flexibility, whether it be two or three days working from home, have grown more quickly than those that require full-time in-office. Among companies that have between 500 and 5,000 employees, for example, structured hybrid companies (i.e., that require employees to come in on some specific days, but not on others) grew headcount 4.6% over the year, while fully flexible companies of that size grew 4.5%. Full-time in-office companies of that size grew only 2.1%, by comparison.</p>                  <p>But there’s a limit to what kind of hybrid arrangement employees seem willing to commit to. Companies that require 1-3 days in the office grew much faster than those that required four or five, the report found.</p>                                                      <p>“Once you start getting closer to full-time in office, requiring four or five days, I think there’s a bright line starting to emerge for employees and for your ability to attract talent,” Sadow says.</p>                  <p>Of course, headcount growth is not necessarily a proxy for a company’s financial health. But in this economy, with an extremely low unemployment rate and some industries still reporting wars over talent, the companies that are hiring are typically the ones growing revenue, Sadow says.</p>                  <p>Atlassian is one company that has committed to being fully flexible. In August 2020, it announced its Team Anywhere policy, which allows employees to decide if they want to be in-office or not. Since then, the company has more than doubled in headcount, from 4,907 to 11,067. (Atlassian also <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/atlassian-team-update-march-2023" target="_blank">laid off </a>500 employees in March because of the “difficult macroeconomic environment.”) “We’re doing [remote work] unequivocally and we’re winning faster than everybody else,” co-CEO Scott Farquhar told me recently. Atlassian still has offices, but it allows employees to decide when (and whether) they want to go in. About half of the company’s new hires live more than two hours from an office, which means they were in locations that Atlassian previously wouldn’t have been able to hire from. The company has also been able to increase diversity because it can hire people who live outside major cities; previously, its biggest U.S. office and headquarters was in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>                                    <p>“Operating beyond the physical footprints of our offices means we can hire people we previously couldn’t,” Farquhar says, including underrepresented groups that prefer or need to work from home or a location where Atlassian doesn’t have offices. “Now we can hire them and provide a career that was previously unattainable because we’ve removed the restraints of physical location.” For instance, Atlassian struggled to hire Black talent in the San Francisco Bay Area but has found some success hiring Black talent in Atlanta, he says. In 2022, 5.4% of the people Atlassian hired were Black people based in the U.S., up from 2.4% in 2020. Similarly, 37.9% of the people Atlassian hired were women in 2022, up from 30.7% in 2020.</p>                  <p>The company has found that flexibility allows people to move closer to family or to more affordable cities; many Atlassians who had been based in San Francisco moved to Seattle after it launched the Team Anywhere policy. The policy has also increased the number of disabled and veteran workers the company hired, since veterans tend to be less likely to live in the country’s most populous cities and disabled workers sometimes struggle with a commute or being required to sit at a desk all day.</p>                                    <p>Of course, allowing workers to be fully remote has its downsides. A study published earlier in July found that fully remote workers are about <a href="https://wfhresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SIEPR1.pdf" target="_blank">10% less productive</a> than workers who are in the office full-time. Fully remote workers can have trouble motivating themselves, the research suggested, and are sometimes more distracted at meetings because they are multi-tasking. That said, the same research shows that hybrid work has no association with lower productivity.</p>                  <p>Farquhar, of Atlassian, says that the company has experimented with ways to keep productivity high and keep people connected, even if they’re rarely in an office. The company leans on “intentional togetherness,” which essentially means planning times where groups of workers are together in-person to socialize. Atlassian has found that there’s a spike in connectedness to the company after these offsites, and that fades after three or four months, by which time the company holds another offsite.</p>                  <p>Veeva Systems is another company that decided to embrace remote work during the pandemic; the life sciences company announced a “Work Anywhere” policy that allows people to decide whether to work at home or in an office. The policy boosted recruiting, says chief people officer Vivian Welsh.. Between the first quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2024, Veeva increased its headcount by 71%, and now has employees in all 50 states. “As some other companies in the industry have changed their policies” to require return to office, Welsh says, “we’ve noticed an increase in interest.”</p>                                    <p>Veeva also has policies aimed at keeping remote workers engaged; it has offsites of whole departments once a year, and “coworking weeks” in which the company pays for small teams to work together in a single office if they have a project to finish. It also requires employees to have video on for Zoom calls, open calendars so others can see what they’re doing, and to work during “core hours” so they are reachable even if they’re not in the office.</p>                  <p>Difficulty hiring does not appear to have motivated companies that ended their fully remote companies to change their policies, but Sadow, of Scoop, says that this may change if the job market remains tight. People may stick with their current employer for a lot of intangible reasons, but when they’re deciding where they want to work next, they may be less willing to put up with stringent in-office companies. And if companies continue having trouble hiring, they may be forced to change.</p>                                    <p><strong>Contact us</strong> at <a href="mailto:letters@time.com?subject=(READER%20FEEDBACK)%20Companies%20Requiring%20Full-Time%20In-Office%20Are%20Struggling%20to%20Recruit%20New%20Employees&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F6294640%2Fremote-work-winning%2F" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">letters@time.com</a>.</p>

<h2>3.0.0 unified release notes<a href="#unified-release-notes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cython 3.0.0 has been a very large effort that cleaned up many old warts,
introduced many new features, and introduces a couple of intentional
behaviour changes, even though the goal remained to stay compatible as
much as possible with Cython 0.29.x. For details, see the <a href="https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/migrating_to_cy30.html">migration guide</a>.</p>
<p>As the development was spread out over several years, a lot of things have
happened in the meantime. Many crucial bugfixes and some features were
backported to 0.29.x and are not strictly speaking “new” in Cython 3.0.0.</p>

<h3>Compatibility with Python<a href="#compatibility-with-python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since Cython 3.0.0 started development, CPython 3.8-3.11 were released.
All these are supported in Cython, including experimental support for the
in-development CPython 3.12. On the other end of the spectrum, support for
Python 2.6 was dropped.</p>
<p>Cython interacts very closely with the C-API of Python, which is where most
of the adaptation work happens. Independently, Cython strives to be able to
parse newer Python constructs for use with its <a href="https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/pure.html">pure python</a> mode, which
has been a focus. In short, this allows to compile a wider range of Python
code into optimized C code.</p>

<section id="initial-support-for-limited-api">
<h3>Initial support for Limited API<a href="#initial-support-for-limited-api" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>CPython provides a stable, limited subset of its C-API as the so-called Limited API.
This C-API comes with the guarantee of a stable ABI, meaning that extensions modules
that were compiled for one version of CPython can also be imported in later versions
without recompilation.</p>
<p>There is initial support for this in Cython.  By defining the <code><span>CYTHON_LIMITED_API</span></code>
macro, Cython cuts down its C-API usage and tries to adhere to the Limited C-API.
By also defining the CPython macro <code><span>Py_LIMITED_API</span></code> to a specific CPython
compatibility version, you can additionally restrict the C-API during the C compilation,
thus enforcing the forward compatibility of the extension module, probably at the cost
of a bit of performance.</p>
<p>Note that “initial support” in Cython really means that setting the <code><span>Py_LIMITED_API</span></code>
macro may not work for your specific code.  There are limitations in the Limited C-API
that are difficult for Cython to generate C code for, so some advanced Python features
(like async code) may not lead to C code that cannot adhere to the Limited C-API, or
where Cython simply does not know yet how to adhere to it.  Basically, if you get your
code to compile with both macros set, and it passes your test suite, then it should be
possible to import the extension module also in later CPython versions.</p>

<h4>Related fixes<a href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Preliminary support for the CPython’s <code><span>Py_LIMITED_API</span></code> (stable ABI) is
available by setting the  <code><span>CYTHON_LIMITED_API</span></code> C macro.  Note that the
support is currently in an early stage and many features do not yet work.
You currently still have to define <code><span>Py_LIMITED_API</span></code> externally in order
to restrict the API usage.  This will change when the feature stabilises.

<p>Cython has gained several major new features that speed up both the development

the dataclass features in C code.  Similarly, the <code><span>@functools.total_ordering</span></code>
decorator to an extension type will implement the comparison functions in C.</p>
<p>Finally, NumPy ufuncs can be generated from simple computation functions with the
new <code><span>@cython.ufunc</span></code> decorator.</p>

<p>The NumPy declarations (<code><span>cimport</span> <span>numpy</span></code>) were moved over to the NumPy project in order
to allow version specific changes on their side.</p>

C compile time.</p>

<p>Cython-implemented C functions now propagate exceptions by default, rather than

<li><p>ctuples can now be assigned from arbitrary sequences, not just Python tuples.</p></li>
<li><p>A new directive <code><span>embedsignature.format</span></code> was added to select the format of the

<section id="id18">
<h3>Features added<a href="#id18" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Cython implemented C functions now propagate exceptions by default, rather than
swallowing them in non-object returning function if the user forgot to add an
<code><span>except</span></code> declaration to the signature.  This was a long-standing source of bugs,
but can require adding the <code><span>noexcept</span></code> declaration to existing functions if
exception propagation is really undesired.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4280">#4280</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>To opt out of the new, safer exception handling behaviour, legacy code can set the new
directive <code><span>legacy_implicit_noexcept=True</span></code> for a transition period to keep the
previous, unsafe behaviour.  This directive will eventually be removed in a later release.
Patch by Matúš Valo.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5094">#5094</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>A new function decorator <code><span>@cython.ufunc</span></code> automatically generates a (NumPy) ufunc that
applies the calculation function to an entire memoryview.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4758">#4758</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The <code><span>**</span></code> power operator now behaves more like in Python by returning the correct complex
result if required by math.  A new <code><span>cpow</span></code> directive was added to turn on the previous
C-like behaviour.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4936">#4936</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The special <code><span>__*pow__</span></code> methods now support the 2- and 3-argument variants.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5160">#5160</a>)</p></li>

Patch by Matúš Valo.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5070">#5070</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Subscripted builtin types in type declarations (like <code><span>list[float]</span></code>) are now
better supported.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5058">#5058</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Python’s <code><span>memoryview</span></code> is now a known builtin type with optimised properties.

<li><p>The Python Enum of a <code><span>cpdef</span> <span>enum</span></code> now inherits from <code><span>IntFlag</span></code> to better match
both Python and C semantics of enums.

<li><p><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0614/">PEP-614</a>:

<li><p>The undocumented, untested and apparently useless syntax
<code><span>from</span> <span>somemodule</span> <span>cimport</span> <span>class/struct/union</span> <span>somename</span></code> was removed.  The type
modifier is not needed here and a plain <code><span>cimport</span></code> of the name will do.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4904">#4904</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>C-style array declarations (<code><span>cdef</span> <span>int</span> <span>a[4]</span></code>) are now (silently) deprecated in
favour of the Java-style <code><span>cdef</span> <span>int[4]</span> <span>a</span></code> form.  The latter was always available
and the Python type declaration syntax already used it exclusively (<code><span>a:</span> <span>int[4]</span></code>).

<h3>Other changes<a href="#id24" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>When using type annotations, <code><span>func(x:</span> <span>list)</span></code> or <code><span>func(x:</span> <span>ExtType)</span></code> (and other
Python builtin or extension types) no longer allow <code><span>None</span></code> as input argument to <code><span>x</span></code>.
This is consistent with the normal typing semantics in Python, and was a common gotcha
for users who did not expect <code><span>None</span></code> to be allowed as input.  To allow <code><span>None</span></code>, use
<code><span>typing.Optional</span></code> as in <code><span>func(x:</span> <span>Optional[list])</span></code>.  <code><span>None</span></code> is also automatically
allowed when it is used as default argument, i.e. <code><span>func(x:</span> <span>list</span> <span>=</span> <span>None)</span></code>.
<code><span>int</span></code> and <code><span>float</span></code> are now also recognised in type annotations and restrict the
value type at runtime.  They were previously ignored.
Note that, for backwards compatibility reasons, the new behaviour does not apply when using
Cython’s C notation, as in <code><span>func(list</span> <span>x)</span></code>.  Here, <code><span>None</span></code> is still allowed, as always.
Also, the <code><span>annotation_typing</span></code> directive can now be enabled and disabled more finely
within the module.

<li><p>The compile-time <code><span>DEF</span></code> and <code><span>IF</span></code> statements are deprecated and generate a warning.
They should be replaced with normal constants, code generation or C macros.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4310">#4310</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Reusing an extension type attribute name as a method name is now an error.

<section id="id36">
<h3>Features added<a href="#id36" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Special methods for binary operators now follow Python semantics.
Rather than e.g. a single <code><span>__add__</span></code> method for cdef classes, where
“self” can be either the first or second argument, one can now define
both <code><span>__add__</span></code> and <code><span>__radd__</span></code> as for standard Python classes.
This behavior can be disabled with the <code><span>c_api_binop_methods</span></code> directive
to return to the previous semantics in Cython code (available from Cython
0.29.20), or the reversed method (<code><span>__radd__</span></code>) can be implemented in
addition to an existing two-sided operator method (<code><span>__add__</span></code>) to get a
backwards compatible implementation.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2056">#2056</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>No/single argument functions now accept keyword arguments by default in order
to comply with Python semantics.  The marginally faster calling conventions
<code><span>METH_NOARGS</span></code> and <code><span>METH_O</span></code> that reject keyword arguments are still available
with the directive <code><span>@cython.always_allow_keywords(False)</span></code>.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3090">#3090</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>A low-level inline function <code><span>total_seconds(timedelta)</span></code> was added to
<code><span>cpython.datetime</span></code> to bypass the Python method call.  Note that this function

<h3>Other changes<a href="#id50" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The default language level was changed to <code><span>3str</span></code>, i.e. Python 3 semantics,
but with <code><span>str</span></code> literals (also in Python 2.7).  This is a backwards incompatible
change from the previous default of Python 2 semantics.  The previous behaviour
is available through the directive <code><span>language_level=2</span></code>.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2565">#2565</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Cython no longer generates <code><span>__qualname__</span></code> attributes for classes in Python
2.x since they are problematic there and not correctly maintained for subclasses.
Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2772">#2772</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Source file fingerprinting now uses SHA-1 instead of MD5 since the latter
tends to be slower and less widely supported these days.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2790">#2790</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The long deprecated include files <code><span>python_*</span></code>, <code><span>stdio</span></code>, <code><span>stdlib</span></code> and
<code><span>stl</span></code> in <code><span>Cython/Includes/Deprecated/</span></code> were removed.  Use the <code><span>libc.*</span></code>

Patch by Jeroen Demeyer.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2904">#2904</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The search order for include files was changed. Previously it was
<code><span>include_directories</span></code>, <code><span>Cython/Includes</span></code>, <code><span>sys.path</span></code>. Now it is
<code><span>include_directories</span></code>, <code><span>sys.path</span></code>, <code><span>Cython/Includes</span></code>. This was done to
allow third-party <code><span>*.pxd</span></code> files to override the ones in Cython.
Patch by Matti Picus.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2905">#2905</a>)</p></li>

<section id="id164">
<h3>Features added<a href="#id164" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>PEP-489 multi-phase module initialisation has been enabled again.  Module
reloads in other subinterpreters raise an exception to prevent corruption
of the static module state.</p></li>
<li><p>A set of <code><span>mypy</span></code> compatible PEP-484 declarations were added for Cython’s C data
types to integrate with static analysers in typed Python code.  They are available
in the <code><span>Cython/Shadow.pyi</span></code> module and describe the types in the special <code><span>cython</span></code>
module that can be used for typing in Python code.
Original patch by Julian Gethmann. (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1965">#1965</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Memoryviews are supported in PEP-484/526 style type declarations.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2529">#2529</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>@cython.nogil</span></code> is supported as a C-function decorator in Python code.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2557">#2557</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Raising exceptions from nogil code will automatically acquire the GIL, instead
of requiring an explicit <code><span>with</span> <span>gil</span></code> block.</p></li>
<li><p>C++ functions can now be declared as potentially raising both C++ and Python
exceptions, so that Cython can handle both correctly.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2615">#2615</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>cython.inline()</span></code> supports a direct <code><span>language_level</span></code> keyword argument that
was previously only available via a directive.</p></li>
<li><p>A new language level name <code><span>3str</span></code> was added that mostly corresponds to language
level 3, but keeps unprefixed string literals as type ‘str’ in both Py2 and Py3,
and the builtin ‘str’ type unchanged.  This will become the default in the next
Cython release and is meant to help user code a) transition more easily to this
new default and b) migrate to Python 3 source code semantics without making support
for Python 2.x difficult.</p></li>
<li><p>In CPython 3.6 and later, looking up globals in the module dict is almost
as fast as looking up C globals.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2313">#2313</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>For a Python subclass of an extension type, repeated method calls to non-overridden
cpdef methods can avoid the attribute lookup in Py3.6+, which makes them 4x faster.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2313">#2313</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>(In-)equality comparisons of objects to integer literals are faster.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2188">#2188</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Some internal and 1-argument method calls are faster.</p></li>
<li><p>Modules that cimport many external extension types from other Cython modules
execute less import requests during module initialisation.</p></li>
<li><p>Constant tuples and slices are deduplicated and only created once per module.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2292">#2292</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The coverage plugin considers more C file extensions such as <code><span>.cc</span></code> and <code><span>.cxx</span></code>.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2266">#2266</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The <code><span>cythonize</span></code> command accepts compile time variable values (as set by <code><span>DEF</span></code>)
through the new <code><span>-E</span></code> option.
Patch by Jerome Kieffer.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2315">#2315</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>pyximport</span></code> can import from namespace packages.
Patch by Prakhar Goel.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2294">#2294</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Some missing numpy and CPython C-API declarations were added.

<li><p>Declarations for the <code><span>pylifecycle</span></code> C-API functions were added in a new .pxd file
<code><span>cpython.pylifecycle</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The Pythran support was updated to work with the latest Pythran 0.8.7.
Original patch by Adrien Guinet.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2600">#2600</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>%a</span></code> is included in the string formatting types that are optimised into f-strings.
In this case, it is also automatically mapped to <code><span>%r</span></code> in Python 2.x.</p></li>
<li><p>New C macro <code><span>CYTHON_HEX_VERSION</span></code> to access Cython’s version in the same style as
<code><span>PY_VERSION_HEX</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Constants in <code><span>libc.math</span></code> are now declared as <code><span>const</span></code> to simplify their handling.</p></li>
<li><p>An additional <code><span>check_size</span></code> clause was added to the <code><span>ctypedef</span> <span>class</span></code> name
specification to allow suppressing warnings when importing modules with
backwards-compatible <code><span>PyTypeObject</span></code> size changes.

<ul>
<li><p>Cython now emits a warning when no <code><span>language_level</span></code> (2, 3 or ‘3str’) is set
explicitly, neither as a <code><span>cythonize()</span></code> option nor as a compiler directive.
This is meant to prepare the transition of the default language level from
currently Py2 to Py3, since that is what most new users will expect these days.
The future default will, however, not enforce unicode literals, because this
has proven a major obstacle in the support for both Python 2.x and 3.x.  The
next major release is intended to make this change, so that it will parse all
code that does not request a specific language level as Python 3 code, but with
<code><span>str</span></code> literals.  The language level 2 will continue to be supported for an
indefinite time.</p></li>
<li><p>The documentation was restructured, cleaned up and examples are now tested.
The NumPy tutorial was also rewritten to simplify the running example.
Contributed by Gabriel de Marmiesse.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2245">#2245</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Cython compiles less of its own modules at build time to reduce the installed
package size to about half of its previous size.  This makes the compiler
slightly slower, by about 5-7%.</p></li>

<li><p>If a module name is explicitly provided for an <code><span>Extension()</span></code> that is compiled
via <code><span>cythonize()</span></code>, it was previously ignored and replaced by the source file
name.  It can now be used to override the target module name, e.g. for compiling
prefixed accelerator modules from Python files.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2038">#2038</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The arguments of the <code><span>num_threads</span></code> parameter of parallel sections
were not sufficiently validated and could lead to invalid C code.
(Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1957">#1957</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Catching exceptions with a non-trivial exception pattern could call into
CPython with a live exception set.  This triggered incorrect behaviour
and crashes, especially in CPython 3.7.</p></li>
<li><p>The signature of the special <code><span>__richcmp__()</span></code> method was corrected to recognise
the type of the first argument as <code><span>self</span></code>.  It was previously treated as plain
object, but CPython actually guarantees that it always has the correct type.
Note: this can change the semantics of user code that previously relied on
<code><span>self</span></code> being untyped.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Extension module initialisation follows
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0489/">PEP 489</a> in CPython 3.5+, which
resolves several differences with regard to normal Python modules.  This makes
the global names <code><span>__file__</span></code> and <code><span>__path__</span></code> correctly available to module
level code and improves the support for module-level relative imports.
(Github issues <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1715">#1715</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1753">#1753</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1035">#1035</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Asynchronous generators (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0525/">PEP 525</a>)
and asynchronous comprehensions (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0530/">PEP 530</a>)
have been implemented.  Note that async generators require finalisation support
in order to allow for asynchronous operations during cleanup, which is only
available in CPython 3.6+.  All other functionality has been backported as usual.</p></li>
<li><p>Variable annotations are now parsed according to
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/">PEP 526</a>.  Cython types (e.g.
<code><span>cython.int</span></code>) are evaluated as C type declarations and everything else as Python
types.  This can be disabled with the directive <code><span>annotation_typing=False</span></code>.
Note that most complex PEP-484 style annotations are currently ignored.  This will
change in future releases. (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1850">#1850</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Extension types (also in pure Python mode) can implement the normal special methods
<code><span>__eq__</span></code>, <code><span>__lt__</span></code> etc. for comparisons instead of the low-level <code><span>__richcmp__</span></code>
method.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/690">#690</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>New decorator <code><span>@cython.exceptval(x=None,</span> <span>check=False)</span></code> that makes the signature
declarations <code><span>except</span> <span>x</span></code>, <code><span>except?</span> <span>x</span></code> and <code><span>except</span> <span>*</span></code> available to pure Python
code.  Original patch by Antonio Cuni.  (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1653">#1653</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Signature annotations are now included in the signature docstring generated by
the <code><span>embedsignature</span></code> directive.  Patch by Lisandro Dalcin (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1781">#1781</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>The gdb support for Python code (<code><span>libpython.py</span></code>) was updated to the latest
version in CPython 3.7 (git rev 5fe59f8).</p></li>
<li><p>The compiler tries to find a usable exception return value for cdef functions
with <code><span>except</span> <span>*</span></code> if the returned type allows it.  Note that this feature is subject
to safety limitations, so it is still better to provide an explicit declaration.</p></li>
<li><p>C functions can be assigned to function pointers with a compatible exception
declaration, not only with exact matches.  A side-effect is that certain compatible
signature overrides are now allowed and some more mismatches of exception signatures
are now detected and rejected as errors that were not detected before.</p></li>
<li><p>The IPython/Jupyter magic integration has a new option <code><span>%%cython</span> <span>--pgo</span></code> for profile
guided optimisation. It compiles the cell with PGO settings for the C compiler,
executes it to generate a runtime profile, and then compiles it again using that
profile for C compiler optimisation.  Currently only tested with gcc.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>len(memoryview)</span></code> can be used in nogil sections to get the size of the
first dimension of a memory view (<code><span>shape[0]</span></code>). (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1733">#1733</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>C++ classes can now contain (properly refcounted) Python objects.</p></li>
<li><p>NumPy dtype subarrays are now accessible through the C-API.
Patch by Gerald Dalley (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/245">#245</a>).</p></li>

<h3>Bugs fixed<a href="#id195" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Extension types that were cimported from other Cython modules could disagree
about the order of fused cdef methods in their call table.  This could lead
to wrong methods being called and potentially also crashes.  The fix required
changes to the ordering of fused methods in the call table, which may break
existing compiled modules that call fused cdef methods across module boundaries,
if these methods were implemented in a different order than they were declared
in the corresponding .pxd file. (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1873">#1873</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>The exception state handling in generators and coroutines could lead to
exceptions in the caller being lost if an exception was raised and handled
inside of the coroutine when yielding. (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1731">#1731</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Loops over <code><span>range(enum)</span></code> were not converted into C for-loops.  Note that it
is still recommended to use an explicit cast to a C integer type in this case.</p></li>
<li><p>Error positions of names (e.g. variables) were incorrectly reported after the
name and not at the beginning of the name.</p></li>
<li><p>Compile time <code><span>DEF</span></code> assignments were evaluated even when they occur inside of
falsy <code><span>IF</span></code> blocks. (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1796">#1796</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>Buffer type mismatches in the NumPy buffer support could leak a reference to the

<li><p>Using the “is_f_contig” and “is_c_contig” memoryview methods together could leave

<li><p>Compilation failed if the for-in-range loop target was not a variable but a more
complex expression, e.g. an item assignment. (Github issue <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1831">#1831</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Compile time evaluations of (partially) constant f-strings could show incorrect
results.</p></li>
<li><p>Escape sequences in raw f-strings (<code><span>fr'...'</span></code>) were resolved instead of passing
them through as expected.</p></li>

(async/await) was implemented.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0448/">PEP 448</a>
(Additional Unpacking Generalizations) was implemented.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for coverage.py 4.0+ can be enabled by adding the plugin
“Cython.Coverage” to the “.coveragerc” config file.</p></li>
<li><p>Annotated HTML source pages can integrate (XML) coverage reports.</p></li>
<li><p>Tracing is supported in <code><span>nogil</span></code> functions/sections and module init code.</p></li>
<li><p>When generators are used in a Cython module and the module imports the
modules “inspect” and/or “asyncio”, Cython enables interoperability by
patching these modules during the import to recognise Cython’s internal
generator and coroutine types. This can be disabled by C compiling the
module with “-D CYTHON_PATCH_ASYNCIO=0” or “-D CYTHON_PATCH_INSPECT=0”</p></li>
<li><p>When generators or coroutines are used in a Cython module, their types
are registered with the <code><span>Generator</span></code> and <code><span>Coroutine</span></code> ABCs in the
<code><span>collections</span></code> or <code><span>collections.abc</span></code> stdlib module at import time to
enable interoperability with code that needs to detect and process Python
generators/coroutines.  These ABCs were added in CPython 3.5 and are
available for older Python versions through the <code><span>backports_abc</span></code> module
on PyPI.  See <a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue24018">https://bugs.python.org/issue24018</a></p></li>
<li><p>Adding/subtracting/dividing/modulus and equality comparisons with

<code><span>dict()</span></code>, <code><span>list()</span></code>, <code><span>set()</span></code>, <code><span>sorted()</span></code> and <code><span>unicode.join()</span></code>
avoid the generator iteration overhead by inlining a part of their
functionality into the for-loop.</p></li>
<li><p>Keyword argument dicts are no longer copied on function entry when they
are not being used or only passed through to other function calls (e.g.
in wrapper functions).</p></li>
<li><p>The <code><span>PyTypeObject</span></code> declaration in <code><span>cpython.object</span></code> was extended.</p></li>
<li><p>The builtin <code><span>type</span></code> type is now declared as PyTypeObject in source,
allowing for extern functions taking type parameters to have the correct
C signatures.  Note that this might break code that uses <code><span>type</span></code> just
for passing around Python types in typed variables.  Removing the type
declaration provides a backwards compatible fix.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>wraparound()</span></code> and <code><span>boundscheck()</span></code> are available as no-ops in pure

<ul>
<li><p>Simple calls to C implemented Python functions/methods are faster.
This also speeds up many operations on builtins that Cython cannot
otherwise optimise.</p></li>
<li><p>The “and”/”or” operators try to avoid unnecessary coercions of their
arguments.  They now evaluate the truth value of each argument
independently and only coerce the final result of the whole expression
to the target type (e.g. the type on the left side of an assignment).
This also avoids reference counting overhead for Python values during
evaluation and generally improves the code flow in the generated C code.</p></li>

<ul>

generated into the C++ declarations, which older C++ compilers could
not parse.</p></li>

<li><p>No longer ignore local setup.cfg files for distutils in pyximport.
Patch by Martin Teichmann.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking a <code><span>char*</span></code> from an indexed Python string generated unsafe
reference counting code.</p></li>
<li><p>Set literals now create all of their items before trying to add them
to the set, following the behaviour in CPython.  This makes a
difference in the rare case that the item creation has side effects
and some items are not hashable (or if hashing them has side effects,
too).</p></li>
<li><p>Cython no longer generates the cross product of C functions for code
that uses memory views of fused types in function signatures (e.g.
<code><span>cdef</span> <span>func(floating[:]</span> <span>a,</span> <span>floating[:]</span> <span>b)</span></code>).  This is considered the
expected behaviour by most users and was previously inconsistent with
other structured types like C arrays.  Code that really wants all type
combinations can create the same fused memoryview type under different
names and use those in the signature to make it clear which types are
independent.</p></li>
<li><p>Names that were unknown at compile time were looked up as builtins at
runtime but not as global module names.  Trying both lookups helps with
globals() manipulation.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed stl container conversion for typedef element types.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>obj.pop(x)</span></code> truncated large C integer values of x to <code><span>Py_ssize_t</span></code>.</p></li>

<li><p>The metaclass of a Python class was not inherited from its parent
class(es).  It is now extracted from the list of base classes if not
provided explicitly using the Py3 <code><span>metaclass</span></code> keyword argument.
In Py2 compilation mode, a <code><span>__metaclass__</span></code> entry in the class
dict will still take precedence if not using Py3 metaclass syntax,
but only <em>after</em> creating the class dict (which may have been done
by a metaclass of a base class, see PEP 3115).  It is generally
recommended to use the explicit Py3 syntax to define metaclasses

<li><p>The automatic C switch statement generation behaves more safely for
heterogeneous value types (e.g. mixing enum and char), allowing for

<h3>Bugs fixed<a href="#id265" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><code><span>isinstance(X,</span> <span>type)</span></code> failed to get optimised into a call to
<code><span>PyType_Check()</span></code>, as done for other builtin types.</p></li>
<li><p>A spurious <code><span>from</span> <span>datetime</span> <span>cimport</span> <span>*</span></code> was removed from the “cpython”
declaration package. This means that the “datetime” declarations
(added in 0.19) are no longer available directly from the “cpython”
namespace, but only from “cpython.datetime”. This is the correct
way of doing it because the declarations refer to a standard library
module, not the core CPython C-API itself.</p></li>
<li><p>The C code for extension types is now generated in topological order
instead of source code order to avoid C compiler errors about missing
declarations for subtypes that are defined before their parent.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code><span>memoryview</span></code> type name no longer shows up in the module dict of
modules that use memory views.  This fixes trac ticket 775.</p></li>
<li><p>Regression in 0.19 that rejected valid C expressions from being used
in C array size declarations.</p></li>
<li><p>In C++ mode, the C99-only keyword <code><span>restrict</span></code> could accidentally be
seen by the GNU C++ compiler. It is now specially handled for both
GCC and MSVC.</p></li>
<li><p>Testing large (&gt; int) C integer values for their truth value could fail
due to integer wrap-around.</p></li>

<h3>Features added<a href="#id268" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>New directives <code><span>c_string_type</span></code> and <code><span>c_string_encoding</span></code> to more easily
and automatically convert between C strings and the different Python string
types.</p></li>
<li><p>The extension type flag <code><span>Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VERSION_TAG</span></code> is enabled by default
on extension types and can be disabled using the <code><span>type_version_tag</span></code> compiler
directive.</p></li>
<li><p>EXPERIMENTAL support for simple Cython code level line tracing.  Enabled by
the “linetrace” compiler directive.</p></li>
<li><p>Cython implemented functions make their argument and return type annotations
available through the <code><span>__annotations__</span></code> attribute (PEP 3107).</p></li>
<li><p>Access to non-cdef module globals and Python object attributes is faster.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>Py_UNICODE*</span></code> coerces from and to Python unicode strings.  This is
helpful when talking to Windows APIs, which use compatible wchar_t
arrays for strings.  Note that the <code><span>Py_UNICODE</span></code> type is otherwise
deprecated as of CPython 3.3.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>isinstance(obj,</span> <span>basestring)</span></code> is optimised.  In Python 3 it only tests
for instances of <code><span>str</span></code> (i.e. Py2 <code><span>unicode</span></code>).</p></li>
<li><p>The <code><span>basestring</span></code> builtin is mapped to <code><span>str</span></code> (i.e. Py2 <code><span>unicode</span></code>) when
compiling the generated C code under Python 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Closures use freelists, which can speed up their creation quite substantially.
This is also visible for short running generator expressions, for example.</p></li>
<li><p>A new class decorator <code><span>@cython.freelist(N)</span></code> creates a static freelist of N
instances for an extension type, thus avoiding the costly allocation step if
possible. This can speed up object instantiation by 20-30% in suitable
scenarios. Note that freelists are currently only supported for base types,
not for types that inherit from others.</p></li>
<li><p>Fast extension type instantiation using the <code><span>Type.__new__(Type)</span></code> idiom has
gained support for passing arguments.  It is also a bit faster for types defined
inside of the module.</p></li>
<li><p>The Python2-only dict methods <code><span>.iter*()</span></code> and <code><span>.view*()</span></code> (requires Python 2.7)
are automatically mapped to the equivalent keys/values/items methods in Python 3
for typed dictionaries.</p></li>
<li><p>Slicing unicode strings, lists and tuples is faster.</p></li>
<li><p>list.append() is faster on average.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>raise</span> <span>Exception()</span> <span>from</span> <span>None</span></code> suppresses the exception context in Py3.3.</p></li>
<li><p>Py3 compatible <code><span>exec(tuple)</span></code> syntax is supported in Py2 code.</p></li>
<li><p>Keyword arguments are supported for cdef functions.</p></li>
<li><p>External C++ classes can be declared nogil.  Patch by John Stumpo.  This fixes
trac ticket 805.</p></li>

<h3>Bugs fixed<a href="#id269" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>2-value slicing of unknown objects passes the correct slice when the <code><span>getitem</span></code>
protocol is used instead of the <code><span>getslice</span></code> protocol (especially in Python 3),
i.e. <code><span>None</span></code> values for missing bounds instead of <code><span>[0,maxsize]</span></code>.  It is also
a bit faster in some cases, e.g. for constant bounds.  This fixes trac ticket 636.</p></li>
<li><p>Cascaded assignments of None values to extension type variables failed with
a <code><span>TypeError</span></code> at runtime.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code><span>__defaults__</span></code> attribute was not writable for Cython implemented
functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Default values of keyword-only arguments showed up in <code><span>__defaults__</span></code> instead
of <code><span>__kwdefaults__</span></code> (which was not implemented).  Both are available for
Cython implemented functions now, as specified in Python 3.x.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>yield</span></code> works inside of <code><span>with</span> <span>gil</span></code> sections.  It previously lead to a crash.
This fixes trac ticket 803.</p></li>
<li><p>Static methods without explicitly named positional arguments (e.g. having only
<code><span>*args</span></code>) crashed when being called.  This fixes trac ticket 804.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>dir()</span></code> without arguments previously returned an unsorted list, which now
gets sorted as expected.</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>dict.items()</span></code>, <code><span>dict.keys()</span></code> and <code><span>dict.values()</span></code> no longer return lists
in Python 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Exiting from an <code><span>except-as</span></code> clause now deletes the exception in Python 3 mode.</p></li>
<li><p>The declarations of <code><span>frexp()</span></code> and <code><span>ldexp()</span></code> in <code><span>math.pxd</span></code> were incorrect.</p></li>

<h3>Features added<a href="#id290" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Alpha quality support for compiling and running Cython generated extension modules in PyPy (through cpyext). Note that this requires at least PyPy 1.9 and in many cases also adaptations in user code, especially to avoid borrowed references when no owned reference is being held directly in C space (a reference in a Python list or dict is not enough, for example). See the documentation on porting Cython code to PyPy.</p></li>
<li><p>“yield from” is supported (PEP 380) and a couple of minor problems with generators were fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>C++ STL container classes automatically coerce from and to the equivalent Python container types on typed assignments and casts. Note that the data in the containers is copied during this conversion.</p></li>
<li><p>C++ iterators can now be iterated over using “for x in cpp_container” whenever cpp_container has begin() and end() methods returning objects satisfying the iterator pattern (that is, it can be incremented, dereferenced, and compared (for non-equality)).</p></li>
<li><p>cdef classes can now have C++ class members (provided a zero-argument constructor exists)</p></li>
<li><p>A new cpython.array standard cimport file allows to efficiently talk to the stdlib array.array data type in Python 2. Since CPython does not export an official C-API for this module, it receives special casing by the compiler in order to avoid setup overhead on user side. In Python 3, both buffers and memory views on the array type already worked out of the box with earlier versions of Cython due to the native support for the buffer interface in the Py3 array module.</p></li>
<li><p>Fast dict iteration is now enabled optimistically also for untyped variables when the common iteration methods are used.</p></li>
<li><p>The unicode string processing code was adapted for the upcoming CPython 3.3 (PEP 393, new Unicode buffer layout).</p></li>
<li><p>Buffer arguments and memory view arguments in Python functions can be declared “not None” to raise a TypeError on None input.</p></li>
<li><p>c(p)def functions in pure mode can specify their return type with “@cython.returns()”.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Old-style Py2 imports did not work reliably in Python 3.x and were broken in Python 3.3. Regardless of this fix, it’s generally best to be explicit about relative and global imports in Cython code because old-style imports have a higher overhead. To this end, “from __future__ import absolute_import” is supported in Python/Cython 2.x code now (previous versions of Cython already used it when compiling Python 3 code).</p></li>
<li><p>Stricter constraints on the “inline” and “final” modifiers. If your code does not compile due to this change, chances are these modifiers were previously being ignored by the compiler and can be removed without any performance regression.</p></li>
<li><p>Exceptions are always instantiated while raising them (as in Python), instead of risking to instantiate them in potentially unsafe situations when they need to be handled or otherwise processed.</p></li>

<li><p>Closures have tightened to include exactly the names used in the inner functions and classes. Previously, they held the complete locals of the defining function.</p></li>
<li><p>The builtin “next()” function in Python 2.6 and later is now implemented internally and therefore available in all Python versions. This makes it the preferred and portable way of manually advancing an iterator.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to the previously supported inlined generator expressions in 0.13, “sorted(genexpr)” can now be used as well. Typing issues were fixed in “sum(genexpr)” that could lead to invalid C code being generated. Other known issues with inlined generator expressions were also fixed that make upgrading to 0.14 a strong recommendation for code that uses them. Note that general generators and generator expressions continue to be not supported.</p></li>
<li><p>Inplace arithmetic operators now respect the cdivision directive and are supported for complex types.</p></li>
<li><p>Typing a variable as type “complex” previously gave it the Python object type. It now uses the appropriate C/C++ double complex type. A side-effect is that assignments and typed function parameters now accept anything that Python can coerce to a complex, including integers and floats, and not only complex instances.</p></li>
<li><p>Large integer literals pass through the compiler in a safer way. To prevent truncation in C code, non 32-bit literals are turned into Python objects if not used in a C context. This context can either be given by a clear C literal suffix such as “UL” or “LL” (or “L” in Python 3 code), or it can be an assignment to a typed variable or a typed function argument, in which case it is up to the user to take care of a sufficiently large value space of the target.</p></li>
<li><p>Python functions are declared in the order they appear in the file, rather than all being created at module creation time. This is consistent with Python and needed to support, for example, conditional or repeated declarations of functions. In the face of circular imports this may cause code to break, so a new –disable-function-redefinition flag was added to revert to the old behavior. This flag will be removed in a future release, so should only be used as a stopgap until old code can be fixed.</p></li>

<section id="id314">
<h3>Features added<a href="#id314" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Closures are fully supported for Python functions. Cython supports inner functions and lambda expressions. Generators and generator expressions are not supported in this release.</p></li>
<li><p>Proper C++ support. Cython knows about C++ classes, templates and overloaded function signatures, so that Cython code can interact with them in a straight forward way.</p></li>
<li><p>Type inference is enabled by default for safe C types (e.g. double, bint, C++ classes) and known extension types. This reduces the need for explicit type declarations and can improve the performance of untyped code in some cases. There is also a verbose compile mode for testing the impact on user code.</p></li>
<li><p>Cython’s for-in-loop can iterate over C arrays and sliced pointers. The type of the loop variable will be inferred automatically in this case.</p></li>
<li><p>The Py_UNICODE integer type for Unicode code points is fully supported, including for-loops and ‘in’ tests on unicode strings. It coerces from and to single character unicode strings. Note that untyped for-loop variables will automatically be inferred as Py_UNICODE when iterating over a unicode string. In most cases, this will be much more efficient than yielding sliced string objects, but can also have a negative performance impact when the variable is used in a Python context multiple times, so that it needs to coerce to a unicode string object more than once. If this happens, typing the loop variable as unicode or object will help.</p></li>
<li><p>The built-in functions any(), all(), sum(), list(), set() and dict() are inlined as plain for loops when called on generator expressions. Note that generator expressions are not generally supported apart from this feature. Also, tuple(genexpr) is not currently supported - use tuple([listcomp]) instead.</p></li>
<li><p>More shipped standard library declarations. The python_* and stdlib/stdio .pxd files have been deprecated in favor of clib.* and cpython[.*] and may get removed in a future release.</p></li>
<li><p>Pure Python mode no longer disallows non-Python keywords like ‘cdef’, ‘include’ or ‘cimport’. It also no longer recognises syntax extensions like the for-from loop.</p></li>
<li><p>Parsing has improved for Python 3 syntax in Python code, although not all features are correctly supported. The missing Python 3 features are being worked on for the next release.</p></li>
<li><p>from __future__ import print_function is supported in Python 2.6 and later. Note that there is currently no emulation for earlier Python versions, so code that uses print() with this future import will require at least Python 2.6.</p></li>
<li><p>New compiler directive language_level (valid values: 2 or 3) with corresponding command line options -2 and -3 requests source code compatibility with Python 2.x or Python 3.x respectively. Language level 3 currently enforces unicode literals for unprefixed string literals, enables the print function (requires Python 2.6 or later) and keeps loop variables in list comprehensions from leaking.</p></li>
<li><p>Loop variables in set/dict comprehensions no longer leak into the surrounding scope (following Python 2.7). List comprehensions are unchanged in language level 2.</p></li>
<li><p>print &gt;&gt; stream</p></li>

<h3>Other changes<a href="#id316" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The availability of type inference by default means that Cython will also infer the type of pointers on assignments. Previously, code like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>cdef</span> <span>char</span>* <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>untyped_variable</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span>
</pre></div>
<p>would convert the char* to a Python bytes string and assign that. This is no longer the case and no coercion will happen in the example above. The correct way of doing this is through an explicit cast or by typing the target variable, i.e.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>cdef</span> <span>char</span>* <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>
<span>untyped_variable1</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>bytes</span><span>&gt;</span><span>s</span>
<span>untyped_variable2</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>object</span><span>&gt;</span><span>s</span>

<span>cdef</span> <span>object</span> <span>py_object</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span>
<span>cdef</span> <span>bytes</span>  <span>bytes_string</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span>
</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>bool is no longer a valid type name by default. The problem is that it’s not clear whether bool should refer to the Python type or the C++ type, and expecting one and finding the other has already led to several hard-to-find bugs. Both types are available for importing: you can use from cpython cimport bool for the Python bool type, and from libcpp cimport bool for the C++ type. bool is still a valid object by default, so one can still write bool(x).</p></li>
<li><p><code><span>__getsegcount__</span></code> is now correctly typed to take a <code><span>Py_size_t*</span></code> rather than an <code><span>int*</span></code>.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Type inference improvements.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There have been several bug fixes and improvements to the type inferencer.</p></li>
<li><p>Notably, there is now a “safe” mode enabled by setting the infer_types directive to None. (The None here refers to the “default” mode, which will be the default in 0.13.) This safe mode limits inference to Python object types and C doubles, which should speed up execution without affecting any semantics such as integer overflow behavior like infer_types=True might. There is also an infer_types.verbose option which allows one to see what types are inferred.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The boundscheck directive works for lists and tuples as well as buffers.</p></li>
<li><p>len(s) and s.decode(“encoding”) are efficiently supported for char* s.</p></li>
<li><p>Cython’s INLINE macro has been renamed to CYTHON_INLINE to reduce conflict and has better support for the MSVC compiler on Windows. It is no longer clobbered if externally defined.</p></li>
<li><p>Revision history is now omitted from the source package, resulting in a 85% size reduction. Running make repo will download the history and turn the directory into a complete Mercurial working repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Cython modules don’t need to be recompiled when the size of an external type grows. (A warning, rather than an error, is produced.) This should be helpful for binary distributions relying on NumPy.</p></li>

      <section>

      <p>Val is a programming language that leverages <a href="http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2022_02/article2.pdf">mutable value semantics</a> and <a href="https://www.fm2gp.com/">generic programming</a> for high-level systems programming.</p>

<p>Val aims to be:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fast by definition</strong>: Val is compiled ahead-of-time to machine code and relies on its type system to support in-place mutation and avoid unnecessary memory allocations. Val avoids hidden costs such as implicit copies and therefore avoids heavy dependence on an optimizer for basic performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Safe by default</strong>: Val’s foundation of <a href="http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2022_02/article2.pdf">mutable value semantics</a> ensures that ordinary code is memory safe, typesafe, and data-race-free. By explicit, auditable opt-in, programmers can use unsafe constructs for performance where necessary, and can build safe constructs using unsafe ones.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple</strong>: Val borrows heavily from <a href="https://swift.org/">Swift</a> which has demonstrated a user-friendly approach to generic programming and deep support for value semantics. Val’s programming model strengthens and extends this support, while de-emphasizing reference semantics and avoiding the complexities that result from trying to make it statically safe (e.g., memory regions, lifetime annotations, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://tour.val-lang.dev/">language tour</a> gives an overview of Val’s features.
The <a href="https://github.com/val-lang/specification/blob/main/spec.md">language specification</a> and <a href="https://val-4.gitbook.io/val-ir/">IR specification</a> (work in progress) provides detailed information about Val’s syntax and semantics.</p>

<p>Val is under active development and is not ready to be used yet.
The code of the compiler is open source and <a href="https://github.com/val-lang/val">hosted on GitHub</a>.
The current status of the project is described on our <a href="https://www.val-lang.dev/pages/implementation-status.html">roadmap page</a>.</p>

<p>We opened a forum to host <a href="https://github.com/orgs/val-lang/discussions">community discussions</a>.
Please ask questions and/or tell us what you think about the Val project!</p>

<h2 id="sounds-great-but-why-another-language">Sounds great, but why another language?</h2>

<p>Our goals overlap substantially with that of Rust and other commendable efforts, such as <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> or <a href="https://vale.dev/">Vale</a>.
Besides, other programming languages have value semantics (e.g., R or Whiley) and/or provide excellent support for generic programming (e.g., Swift or Haskell).
So why another one?</p>

<p>What sets Val apart in the current landscape is its focus on mutable value semantics for the purpose of writing efficient, generic code.
Val is a zero-cost abstraction language that fully acknowledges the physical constraints of computer architecture.
Yet, it presents a user model that marries these constraints with the benefits of value-oriented programming.</p>

<h2 id="enough-show-me-some-code">Enough, show me some code!</h2>

<p>Okay, okay.
Here’s a simple program:</p>

<pre><code>subscript longer_of(_ a: inout String, _ b: inout String): String {
  if b.count() &gt; a.count() { yield &amp;b } else { yield &amp;a }
}

fun emphasize(_ z: inout String, strength: Int = 1) {
  z.append(repeat_element("!", count: strength)))
}

public fun main() {
  var (x, y) = ("Hi", "World")
  emphasize(&amp;longer_of[&amp;x, &amp;y])
  print("${x} ${y}") // "Hi World!"
}
</code></pre>

<p>This program declares two character strings, appends an exclamation mark to the longest, and prints them both after the mutation.
No pointers or references are used (<code>&amp;</code> in Val does not mean “address of”—it simply marks a mutation), and no unnecessary allocation occurs.
The result of <code>longer_of</code> is a <em>projection</em> of the longer argument, so the mutation of <code>z</code> by <code>emphasize</code> occurs directly on the value of <code>y</code>.  The value is neither copied, nor moved, and yet it is not being passed by reference to <code>emphasize</code>.  The body of <code>emphasize</code> <em>owns</em> <code>z</code> in exactly the same way as it owns <code>strength</code>, which is passed by value: <code>z</code> is an independent value that can only be touched by <code>emphasize</code>.</p>

<p>To better understand, notice that <code>longer_of</code> is not a function; it’s a subscript.
A subscript does not return a value, it <em>projects</em> one, granting the caller temporary read and/or write access to it.</p>

<p>A Python programmer may think that <code>String</code> has reference semantics and that <code>longer_of</code> is simply returning a reference to <code>y</code>.
A C/C++ programmer may think of <code>longer_of</code> as a function that takes and returns pointers or mutable references to values.
Neither of these views are quite right.
All types in Val are value types and their instances behave like ints. 
As a result, the possible accesses to a function parameter are always visible in the body of that function, and can’t be hidden behind some stored reference.</p>

<p>The language guarantees to <code>emphasize</code> that the value of <code>z</code> will not be accessed via <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> (or any other means) until that function returns.</p>

<p>A Rust programmer may think of <code>longer_of</code> as a function that borrows its arguments mutably and returns a mutable reference bound by the lifetime of those arguments.
What happens is semantically identical, but notice that in Val, <code>longer_of</code> has no lifetime annotations.
Lifetime annotations were not elided, they simply do not exist in Val because it uses a simpler model, devoid of references.</p>

<p>Have a look at the section on subscripts in the <a href="https://tour.val-lang.dev/subscripts">language tour</a> to get more information.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Elon Musk, Larry Ellison and other current and former members of Tesla's board of directors will return $735 million to settle claims that they massively overpaid themselves, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/tesla-directors-settle-lawsuit-over-compensation-735-mln-2023-07-17/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0"><em>Reuters</em></a> has reported. The deal wraps up a saga that started in 2020 stemming from a lawsuit filed by a police and firefighter retirement fund challenging stock options granted to Tesla's board starting in 2017. Directors also agreed not to receive compensation for 2021, 2022 and 2023, and change the way compensation is calculated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tesla's current board includes Elon Musk, his brother Kimbal, Fox News mogul James Murdoch, Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia and former Tesla CTO JB Straubel. The case is separate from a <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-hear-final-arguments-trial-over-musks-56-bln-tesla-pay-2023-02-21/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0">lawsuit</a> filed by shareholders against a $56 billion compensation package awarded to CEO Elon Musk.</p>
<p>The Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit accused Tesla's board of giving itself unfair and excessive compensation in the form of 11 million stock options between 2017 and 2020, saying it grossly exceeded norms for a corporate board. The $735 million settlement will be paid back to Tesla in what's called a "derivative lawsuit" — the largest ever awarded by Delaware's Court of Chancerty, according to <em>Reuters</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tesla argued that stock options were used to ensure Director's incentives were aligned with investor goals. Tesla has yet to comment on the affair, but in court documents, said that it agreed to settle to eliminate the risk of future litigation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk is fighting a separate lawsuit to defend his $56 billion pay package. It was <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/09/23/judge-orders-tesla-board-to-face-trial-with.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0">brought</a> by shareholder Richard Tornette, who claimed that "the largest compensation grant in human history" was given to Musk, even though he didn't focus entirely on Tesla. In 2020, he received the <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/teslas-texas-factory-has-produced-its-first-cybertruck-161840934.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0">first of 12 $700 million payments</a> as part of that package.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>By David Seddon from Kraken Technologies.</p><p>Hi, I’m David, a Python developer at Kraken Technologies. I work on Kraken: a Python application which has, at last count, 27,637 modules. Yes, you read that right: nearly 28k separate Python files - not including tests. I do this along with 400 other developers worldwide, constantly merging in code. And all anyone needs to make a change - and kick start a deployment of the software that runs 17 different energy and utility companies, with many millions of customers - is one single approval from a colleague on Github.</p><p>Now you may be thinking this sounds like a recipe for chaos. Honestly, I would have said the same. But it turns out that large numbers of developers can, at least in the domain we work in, work effectively on a large Python monolith. There are lots of reasons why this is possible, many of them cultural rather than technical, but in this blog post I want to explain about how the organisation of our code helps to make this possible.</p><h3 id="layering-our-code-base">Layering our code base</h3><p>If you’ve worked on a code base for any length of time, you will have felt the drift towards unpleasant complexity. Strands of logic tangle together across your application, and it becomes increasingly difficult to think about parts of it in isolation. This is what started happening to our young code base, and so we decided to adopt what is known as a ‘layered architecture’ where there are constraints about what parts of the code base can know about each other. </p><p>Layering is a well-known software architecture pattern in which components are organized, conceptually, into a stack. A component is not allowed to depend on any components higher up the stack.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.europython.eu/content/images/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-07-at-12.05.41-AM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1140" height="760" srcset="https://blog.europython.eu/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-07-at-12.05.41-AM.png 600w, https://blog.europython.eu/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-07-at-12.05.41-AM.png 1000w, https://blog.europython.eu/content/images/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-07-at-12.05.41-AM.png 1140w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Layered Architecture where dependencies flow downward</figcaption></figure><p>For example, in the above diagram, C would be allowed to depend on B and A, but not D.</p><p>The idea of a layered architecture is broad: it may be applied to different kinds of components. For example, you could layer several independently-deployable services; or alternatively your components could just be a set of source code files.</p><p>What constitutes a dependency is also broad. In general, if a component has direct knowledge of another component (even if purely at a conceptual level) then it depends on it. Indirect interaction (e.g. via configuration) is not usually seen as a dependency.</p><h3 id="layers-in-python">Layers in Python</h3><p>In a Python code base, the layers are best thought of as Python modules, and dependencies as import statements.</p><p>Take the following code base:</p><pre><code>myproject
    __init__.py
    payments/
        __init__.py
        api.py
        vendor.py
    products.py
    shopping_cart.py</code></pre><p>The top-level modules and subpackages are good candidates for layers. Let’s say we decide the layers should be in this order:</p><pre><code>shopping_cart
payments
products</code></pre><p>Our architecture would thus forbid, for example, any of the modules within <em>payments</em> from importing from <em>shopping_cart</em>. They could, however, import from <em>products</em>.</p><p>Layering can also be nested, so we could choose to layer within our payments module like so:</p><pre><code>api
vendor</code></pre><p>There’s no single, correct way of choosing which layers exist, and in which order - that’s an act of design. But layering like this leads to a less tangled code base, making it easier to understand and change.</p><h3 id="how-we%E2%80%99ve-layered-kraken">How we’ve layered Kraken</h3><p>At the time of writing, 17 different energy and utility companies license Kraken. We call these companies clients, and run a separate instance for each. Now, one of Kraken’s main characteristics is that different instances are ‘the same, but different’. In other words, there is a lot of shared behavior, but also every client has bespoke code that defines their specific needs. This is also true at the territory level: there are commonalities between all the clients that run in Britain (they integrate with the same energy industry) that aren’t shared with, say, Octopus Energy Japan.</p><p>As Kraken grew into a multi-client platform, we evolved our layering to help with this. Broadly speaking, it now looks like this at the top level:</p><pre><code>kraken/
    __init__.py
    clients/
        __init__.py
        oede/
        oegb/
        oejp/
        ...
	territories/
    	__init__.py
        deu/
        gbr/
        jpn/
        ...
    core/</code></pre><p>The clients layer is at the top. Each client gets a subpackage inside that layer (for example, <em>oede</em> corresponds to Octopus Energy Germany). Below that is territories, for all the country-specific behaviour, again with territory-specific subpackages. The bottom layer is core, which contains code that is used by all clients. There is an additional rule, which is that client subpackages must be independent (i.e. not import from other clients), and the same goes for territories.</p><p>Layering Kraken like this allows us to make changes with a limited ‘blast radius’. Because the clients layer is at the top, nothing depends on it directly, making it easier to change something that relates to a particular client without accidentally affecting behavior on a different client. Likewise, changes that relate only to one territory won’t affect anything in a different one. This allows us to move quickly and independently across teams, especially when we are making changes that only affect a small number of Kraken instances.</p><h3 id="enforcing-layering-with-import-linter">Enforcing layering with Import Linter</h3><p>When we introduced layering, we quickly found that just talking about the layering was not enough. Developers would often accidentally introduce layering violations. We needed to enforce it somehow, and we do this using <a href="https://import-linter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"><em>Import Linter</em></a>.</p><p><em>Import Linter</em> is an open source tool for checking that you are following layered architectures. First, in an INI file you define a contract describing your layering - something like this</p><pre><code>[importlinter:contract:top-level]

name = Top level layers
type = layers
layers =
    kraken.clients
    kraken.territories
    Kraken.core</code></pre><p>We can also enforce the independence of the different clients and territories, using two more contracts (this time `<em>independence`</em> contracts)</p><pre><code>[importlinter:contract:client-independence]
name = Client independence
type = independence
layers =
    kraken.clients.oede
    kraken.clients.oegb
    kraken.clients.oejp
    ...

[importlinter:contract:territory-independence]
name = Territory independence
type = independence
layers =
    kraken.territories.deu
    kraken.territories.gbr
    kraken.territories.jpn
    ...</code></pre><p>Then you can run lint-imports on the command line and it will tell you whether or not there are any imports that break our contracts. We run this in the automated checks on every pull request, so if someone introduces an illegal import, the checks will fail and they won’t be able to merge it.</p><p>These are not the only contracts. Teams can add their own layering deeper in the application: <em>kraken.territories.jpn</em>, for example, is itself layered. We currently have over 40 contracts in place.</p><h3 id="burning-down-technical-debt">Burning down technical debt</h3><p>When we introduced the layered architecture, we weren’t able to adhere to it from day one. So we used a feature in Import Linter which allows you to ignore certain imports before checking the contract.</p><pre><code>[importlinter:contract:my-layers-contract]
name = My contract
type = layers
layers =
    kraken.clients
    kraken.territories
    kraken.core
ignore_imports =
    kraken.core.customers -&gt;
    kraken.territories.gbr.customers.views
    kraken.territories.jpn.payments -&gt; kraken.utils.urls
    (and so on...)</code></pre><p>We then used the number of ignored imports as a metric for tracking technical debt. This allowed us to observe whether things were improving, and at what rate.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.europython.eu/content/images/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-07-at-12.45.09-AM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1360" height="760" srcset="https://blog.europython.eu/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-07-at-12.45.09-AM.png 600w, https://blog.europython.eu/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-07-at-12.45.09-AM.png 1000w, https://blog.europython.eu/content/images/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-07-at-12.45.09-AM.png 1360w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Ignored imports since 1 May 2022</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s our graph of how we’ve been working through ignored imports over the last year or so. Periodically I share this to show people how we’re doing and encourage them to work towards complete adherence. We use this burndown approach for several other technical debt metrics too.</p><h3 id="downsides-there-are-always-downsides">Downsides, there are always downsides</h3><p><strong>Local complexity</strong></p><p>At some point after adopting a layered architecture, you will run into a situation where you want to break the layers. Real life is complex, there are interdependencies everywhere, and you will find yourself wanting to, say, call a function that’s in a higher layer.</p><p>Fortunately, there is always a way around this. It’s called <a href="https://seddonym.me/2019/04/15/inversion-of-control/">inversion of control</a> and it’s easy to do in Python, it just requires a mindset shift. But it does lead to an increase in ‘local’ complexity (i.e. in a little part of your code base). However, it’s a price worth paying for a simpler system overall.</p><p><strong>Too much code in higher layers</strong></p><p>The higher the layer, the easier the change. We deliberately made it easy to change code for specific clients or territories. Code in the core, which everything depends on, is more costly and risky to make changes to.</p><p>As a result, there has been a design pressure, brought about partly by the layering we chose, to write more client and territory-specific rather than introduce deeper, more globally useful code into the core. As a result, there is more code in the higher layers than we might ideally like. We’re still learning about how to tackle this.</p><p><strong>We’re still not finished</strong></p><p>Remember those ignored imports? Well, years on, we still have some! At last count, 15. Those last few imports are the stubbornest, most tangled ones of all.</p><p>It can take serious effort to retrospectively layer a code base. But the sooner you do it, the less tangling you’ll have to address.</p><h2 id="in-summary">In summary</h2><p>Layering Kraken has kept our very large code base healthy and relatively easy to work with, especially considering its size. Without imposing constraints on the relationships between the tens of thousands of modules, our code base would probably have tangled into an enormous plate of spaghetti. But the large scale structure we chose - and evolved along with the business - has helped us work in large numbers on a single Python code base. It shouldn’t be possible, but it is!</p><p>If you’re working on a large Python codebase - or even a relatively small one - give layering a try. The sooner you do, the easier it will be.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Kraken Technologies LTD's </em></strong>is sponsor of EuroPython 2023, check them out on <a href="https://kraken.tech/">https://kraken.tech/</a></blockquote>

            <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2023 19:33:33 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jul/18/accessing-llama-2/">https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jul/18/accessing-llama-2/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36778041">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>




<p>The big news today is <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/">Llama 2</a>, the new openly licensed Large Language Model from Meta AI. It’s a really big deal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Llama 2 is available for free for research and commercial use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(swyy <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1681364325469143040">spotted</a> that it was rebranded from LLaMA 2 to Llama 2 <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/commit/6d4c0c290aeec1fa4399694fefb864be5a153bb6">a few hours ago</a>.)</p>
<p>Facebook’s original LLaMA model, released in February, kicked off a seismic wave of innovation in the world of open source LLMs—from fine-tuned variants to from-scratch recreations. I wrote about the impact this was having a few weeks after its original release in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/11/llama/">Large language models are having their Stable Diffusion moment</a>. If anything I under-estimated how significant this was going to be.</p>
<p>There was just one catch: you couldn’t use it for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>That’s changed with Llama 2!</p>
<p>It does still have <a href="https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/">a couple of interesting limitations</a>, emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will not use the Llama Materials or any output or results of the Llama Materials <strong>to improve any other large language model</strong> (excluding Llama 2 or derivative works thereof).</p>
<p>If, on the Llama 2 version release date, the monthly active users of the products or services made available by or for Licensee, or Licensee’s affiliates, <strong>is greater than 700 million monthly active users</strong> in the preceding calendar month, you must request a license from Meta, which Meta may grant to you in its sole discretion[...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This still makes it available for most commercial purposes. Let’s try it out.</p>
<h4>Accessing Llama 2 using LLM</h4>
<p>My <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> tool provides command-line access to a wide variety of language models, both via web APIs and self-hosted on your own machine.</p>
<p>Last week <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jul/12/llm/">I added plugin support</a> for extending it to support new models. An independently released plugin can now add support for new models to the existing CLI tool.</p>
<p>The brand new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-replicate">llm-replicate</a> plugin provides CLI access to models hosted on <a href="https://replicate.com/">Replicate</a>, and this morning a16z-infra released <a href="https://replicate.com/a16z-infra/llama13b-v2-chat">a16z-infra/llama13b-v2-chat</a> which provides Replicate API access to the new Llama 2 13B chat model.</p>
<p>You’ll need a <a href="https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens">Replicate API key</a>.</p>
<p>Install LLM like this:</p>

<p>(I like to use <a href="https://pypa.github.io/pipx/">pipx</a>.)</p>
<p>Or if you don’t have <code>pip</code> setup but can use <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>:</p>
<div><pre>brew install simonw/llm/llm</pre></div>
<p>Run <code>llm --version</code> to confirm it’s installed.</p>
<p>Next, install the <code>llm-replicate</code> plugin:</p>
<div><pre>llm install llm-replicate</pre></div>
<p>The plugin adds a new <code>llm replicate</code> set of commands—see them with <code>llm --help</code>.</p>
<p>Configure your Replicate API key so the plugin can talk to the API:</p>

<pre><code>Enter key: &lt;paste key here&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Register the new <code>a16z-infra/llama13b-v2-chat</code> model with the plugin:</p>
<div><pre>llm replicate add a16z-infra/llama13b-v2-chat \
  --chat --alias llama2</pre></div>
<p>This tells the plugin that it’s a “chat” model, which means you can have continuing conversations with it, rather than just sending single prompts.</p>
<p>Now we can send a prompt, using the <code>llama2</code> alias we configured there:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m llama2 "Ten great names for a pet pelican"
</code></pre>
<p>I get this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Certainly! Here are ten great names for a pet pelican:</p>
<ol>
<li>Peanut: A cute and playful name for a small pelican.</li>
<li>Puddles: A fun and silly name for a pelican that loves to splash around in water.</li>
<li>Pete: A classic name that suits a friendly and outgoing pelican.</li>
<li>Penelope: A pretty and elegant name for a female pelican.</li>
<li>Percy: A charming and sophisticated name for a male pelican.</li>
<li>Pippy: A playful and affectionate name for a pelican with a lively personality.</li>
<li>Pelty: A fun and quirky name for a pelican with a unique sense of style.</li>
<li>Pip: A sweet and endearing name for a small pelican.</li>
<li>Plucky: A feisty and adventurous name for a pelican with a big personality.</li>
<li>Poppy: A lovely and delicate name for a female pelican with a sweet disposition.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope these suggestions help you find the perfect name for your pet pelican!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And because it’s a chat model, we can send a follow-up prompt to the <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/usage.html#continuing-a-conversation">same conversation</a>:</p>
<div><pre>llm -c <span><span>"</span>Five more and make them more nautical<span>"</span></span></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Ahoy! Here be five more nautical names for yer pet pelican:</p>
<ol>
<li>Seabird: A fitting name for a pelican that loves the ocean and all its wonders.</li>
<li>Captain Hook: A swashbuckling name for a pelican with a bold and fearless spirit.</li>
<li>Anchor: A sturdy and dependable name for a pelican that’s always grounded and stable.</li>
<li>Finley: A fishy name for a pelican with a love for the sea and all its creatures.</li>
<li>Buoyant: A bouncy and cheerful name for a pelican with a lighthearted and carefree attitude.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope these suggestions float yer boat, matey!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>LLM logs every prompt and response sent through it to a SQLite database. I’m using <code>--truncate</code> here to shorten the output to include in this post:</p>

<p>Or with <a href="https://datasette.io/desktop">Datasette Desktop</a>:</p>
<pre><code>open "$(llm logs path)"

<h4>What’s next</h4>
<p>I’m really excited about Llama 2. I expect we’ll start seeing all kinds of innovation on top of it as the model weights themselves start to roll out.</p>
<p>I’m particularly looking forward to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fine-tuned models. Alpaca, Vicuna et-al did amazing things with fine-tuning on top of the original LLaMA. I expect we’ll see dozens of fine-tuned models over the next few weeks.</li>
<li>Implementation of the <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/python-react-pattern">reAct</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761">Toolformer</a> patterns, which will enable Llama 2 to drive external tools in a similar way to <a href="https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates">OpenAI Functions</a>. The <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/">Llama 2 paper</a> mentions testing against Toolformer prompts already, so this hopefully won’t be too difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully this time we’ll start to see a concerted effort from people to document what kind of prompts work well with Llama 2 for practical purposes, since I expect this model will be an influential piece of the ecosystem for some time to come.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>We were sent a <strong>Nintendo 64 test cartridge</strong> ROM that was dumped anonymously. Zoinkity wrote up a nice readme explaining the details which is included in the <strong>7ZIP</strong> file we’ve uploaded to the Internet Archive for safekeeping. Download it by clicking <strong><a href="https://archive.org/details/n64_testcart">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Below is the text from the included readme file with details.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/51ZcT6Cv7SL.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/51ZcT6Cv7SL-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" srcset="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/51ZcT6Cv7SL-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/51ZcT6Cv7SL-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/51ZcT6Cv7SL-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/51ZcT6Cv7SL.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></p>
<p>.: Nintendo 64 Test Cart version 1.? :.</p>
<p>Finally, a public release of both complete ROMs from a Nintendo 64 test cart!<br>
Wait, both!?</p>
<p>Test carts were designed to be reprogrammed–in full or in part–through the jtag port or via gangwriter. When there’s any kind of electrical delay whatsoever it seems to map the “testcart_reflash” ROM, allowing you to pipe a new “testcart_runtime” to it. (Check the “reflash interface.txt” doc for more info on how that works.)<br>
That’s rather been the problem up to this point, but it turns out if you stick a bit of polyimide tape over the cart’s CIC pins you can boot to a 64DD while it still maps the main runtime (assuming yours has a CIC+IPL or you programmed your own). Having the code you want exposed means you can just DMA everything instead of trying to read from the exposed flash addresses; there’s a bit of a trick to doing that with 16bit hardware.<br>
This dump was taken via a 64DD dev unit while the runtime was accessible. It was checked against a second dump taken via IO access (doubled-reads, similar to the writing method), and both were compared against an earlier partial dump to verify known good contents. You could also read the individual flash units themselves if your IC programmer supports the chipset / has the right adapter.</p>
<p>Please note that the runtime is not supposed to be some perfect multiple of a chip size. If you have ever had the “privilege” of using jtag you’d understand why. The reflasher is aligned to the start of the last unit (each unit being 0x200000 large) and retains its padding (in other words, the unwritten bytes erased to 0xFF at the end). That file has a maximum size in other words, so that feels like an important thing to preserve.</p>
<p>.: Why version 1.? :.<br>
The specific build is up for debate. It is clearly *not* version 1.0. It’s suspected to be at least a version 1.1–likely final–based on the audio test.<br>
There are two existing blobs of source code for the Go/No Go tool (GnG, used for factory quality control): one from the OMAN archive and another distributed with libultra OS2.0E. Both predate this release (built against OS2.0H). The most noticeable–arguably only–difference from 2.0E is that the left/right audio test stopped using beeps and midi sequences, replacing them with a voice saying “This is your * channel.” It also doesn’t use the “subway” sequence. It’s not clear what version was first used for these standalone cartridges.<br>
(So yes, there’s at least one other version that needs to be tracked down and dumped.)</p>
<p>For those in the know, a partial dump of the main runtime was taken by marshallh back on Jun 29, 2016. That was done by sniffing the address lines and was largely complete, lacking only data that wasn’t accessed (as opposed to used). It’s been available to emulator devs since then, awaiting a complete dump before public release. It’s the same build as this one or very, very close.<br>
It was missing:<br>
*) The tail end of all audio samples. They’re clipped by the player before running to completion so the ends weren’t loaded. (Samples are only loaded on-demand in blocks.) One did have a short non-matching segment, could be a smidgen of corruption or maybe it was leveling or something applied to a single spot.<br>
*) Sequences for noteLeft, noteRight, and subway (plays G, then E). LR were replaced by more explicit “This is your * channel.” messages from version 1.1 onward, but the original beeps &amp; sequences are still compiled in.<br>
*) The number sequence used for the PI test. This is only run (or relevant) when a zaru test rig is attached, not when booted standalone (unless you run it manually via command line).</p>
<p>.: About Zaru :.<br>
Also provided is a short, hopefully accurate, document on how the zaru rig should operate. You could theoretically build one and stick it in a controller slot (like a mempak) to pointlessly check all your grounds. Many of the tests only run with a zaru or run alternate code when one is found.</p>
<p>.: Does It Emulate? :.<br>
If it doesn’t, complain to your emulator’s devs.<br>
There isn’t much point to emulating it other than to confirm accuracy or complaining about the lack of it. The central focus is usually on passing the RCP tests, but you’d be surprised how few emulators support the Recenter button (the Start in L+R+Start toggles 0080, not 1000) or how many neglect the VI entirely, directly outputting the framebuffer (the wiggly triangle video test uses VI settings to clip a window out of the framebuffer and scale it, otherwise you’ll see a triangle bouncing inside a box). Or how many aren’t unicode-aware. (Did they just copy some old PJ64 source or something? Is it that hard to use strncpy(20) and decode instead of hoping a raw bytes “filename” doesn’t throw an error?)</p>
<p>It works fine on flashcarts, but then the test cartridge *is* a flashcart so that’s no surprise. Might be useful if you did a console mod and need to know how bad your solder job really was.</p>
<p>Note it’s *supposed* to display garbage for ~15 seconds, then differently colored garbage about as long before ultimately loading the interface. There’s an initial bootloader in the 80200000 range that first runs some very basic tests–like confirming RDRAM is available &amp; works by running through its setup and some r/w tests–before loading the actual interface code to the 80000000 range, faking a reset (except with zaru where the reset is quite real), then going through the entire initialization routine again and finally setting up some video. Don’t be surprised that it has two sets of basic lib functions. You can sidestep that–and need to if you’re using an iQue–but you’re also avoiding some of the lowest level tests.<br>
It runs some tests a bit differently if 4MB, 6MB, or 8MB of RDRAM are detected. If you don’t think 6MB was ever a thing, try asking around about 64DD support in Ocarina of Time ;*)</p>
<p>The reflasher is relatively pointless to run without a real unit. It was incredibly helpful to learn how to talk to the flash properly and understand the IO limitations; the dumper(s) wouldn’t have been possible without it.</p>

Moreover, the cluster can be <a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/stable/admin_guide/cluster_management.html#rebalance-shards-without-downtime">rebalanced</a> based on disk usage, such that large schemas automatically get more resources dedicated to them, while small schemas are efficiently packed together.</p> <p><strong>So far, Citus primarily focused on “row-based sharding”, where tables are hash-distributed across nodes based on the value in the distribution column.</strong> Row-based sharding enables arbitrarily large PostgreSQL tables, with parallel distributed queries, query routing based on filters, and distributed DML and DDL. Row-based sharding is very suitable for analytical applications (e.g. IoT, time series) and other scenarios in which you need very large tables. It also works well for multi-tenant applications that keep their data in a set of shared tables, but to be able to distribute your database effectively you to add a “tenant ID” column to all your tables, and include that column in all filters, inserts, foreign keys, etc. You also need to explicitly run <a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/stable/develop/reference_ddl.html#creating-and-distributing-tables">create_distributed_table</a> to select a distribution column for each table. If you skip one of these steps, performance might be poor due to network overhead, or you might run into <a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/stable/develop/reference_workarounds.html">distributed SQL limitations</a>.</p> <p><strong>Schema-based sharding has almost no data modelling restrictions or special steps compared to unsharded PostgreSQL.</strong> That makes it easy to build a scalable multi-tenant application with a schema per tenant, or other applications where different parts of your data model can live in different schemas. The main restriction of schema-based sharding is that joins and foreign keys should only involve tables from the same schema (or <a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/stable/develop/reference_ddl.html#reference-tables">reference tables</a>), but transactions across schemas still work fine. That makes schema-based sharding much easier to use than row-based sharding, though it only makes sense for specific workload patterns. For applications that can use either model (e.g. multi-tenant apps), a downside of schema-based sharding is the need to manage many tables and performance overhead. A more detailed comparison is given <a href="#choosing-a-sharding-model-for-multi-tenant-saas-apps">below</a>.</p> <h2 id="how-to-use-citus-schema-based-sharding">How to use Citus schema-based sharding for Postgres</h2> <p>You can easily get started with schema-based sharding by enabling the <code>citus.enable_schema_based_sharding</code> setting.

To use schema-based sharding in Citus 12 or later, you create multiple schemas, and use <code>search_path</code> or fully qualified names to switch between schemas when creating tables or running queries.

No additional data modelling steps (like <code>create_distributed_table</code>) required!</p> <p>In a follow up blog post, we’ll dive deeper into different usage scenarios and schema management.</p> <h2 id="benefits-of-schema-based-sharding">Benefits of schema-based sharding in Citus and Postgres</h2> <p>Schema-based sharding gives you an easy path for sharding if your application and database model fits into one of these classes:</p> <p><strong>Multi-tenant applications (schema per tenant)</strong>: Software as a service (SaaS) applications serve many different tenants from a single deployment, often backed by a single database for ease-of-management and cost efficiency. Most queries done by these SaaS applications can be scoped to a single tenant, which makes the tenant a natural shard key. You can shard your Citus database by creating a schema per tenant, as an alternative to distributing tables by a tenant ID column.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.citusdata.com/assets/images/blog/marco-blog-diagram-citus12-fig1.png" width="800" height="380" loading="lazy" alt="schema per tenant app diagram"> <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Schema per tenant application where each tenant has its own schema, typically with the same set of tables</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Microservices (schema per microservice)</strong>: Many cloud-native applications are broken down into microservices that are developed and deployed separately. Each microservice has its own state, which is usually quite small, and simple. Rather than creating and managing a separate database system for each microservice, it is useful to consolidate the state of different microservices into a single distributed database. That way, you have a single place to manage and query all data, can share data and perform transactions across microservices, and can minimize cost by sharing resources, without the database becoming a bottleneck.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.citusdata.com/assets/images/blog/marco-blog-diagram-citus12-fig2.png" width="800" height="380" loading="lazy" alt="schema per microservice app diagram"> <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Schema per microservice application, with each microservice having its state in a separate schema in the same distributed database.</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Vertical partitioning (schema per table group):</strong> The databases of complex OLTP applications often involve many different tables, and not all of them are closely related. “Vertical partitioning” refers to the practice of sharding your database into groups related tables with each group living on its own database server. With schema-based sharding, you can easily achieve this or prepared for it upfront by assigning each group to its own schema and scale out only when necessary (and avoid all the <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figma-scaled-to-multiple-databases/">growing pains</a>).</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.citusdata.com/assets/images/blog/marco-blog-diagram-citus12-fig3.png" width="800" height="380" loading="lazy" alt="vertical partitioning diagram"> <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Vertical partitioning with groups of related tables combined in a schema</figcaption> </figure> <p>Within a distributed schema, you can use arbitrary joins and foreign keys. Transactions that remain scoped to a schema will be efficiently delegated to the node that stores the schema, which minimizes overhead and gives you PostgreSQL performance characteristics at any scale. Distributed transactions across schemas are still possible, with some additional network round trips.</p> <p>Schema-based sharding offers many other benefits over manual, application-level sharding:</p> <ul> <li>Very easy shard management: Just CREATE/DROP SCHEMA, and Citus does the rest.</li> <li><a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/stable/admin_guide/cluster_management.html#rebalance-shards-without-downtime">Automatic rebalancing</a> of schemas across nodes without downtime.</li> <li>Share data across schemas using <a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/stable/develop/reference_ddl.html?highlight=reference%20tables#reference-tables">reference tables</a> with support for local joins and foreign keys.</li> <li><a href="https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2023/05/12/tenant-monitoring-in-citus-and-postgres-with-citus-stat-tenants/">Tenant-level statistics</a>, which has been expanded in Citus 12 to treat schemas as tenants.</li> <li>Mixed distributed database modes, e.g. multi-tenancy apps where small tenants live in a shared table and large tenants have their own distributed schema. Or ultra-large tenants / microservices live in a regular schema with distributed tables, while others have a distributed schema.</li> <li>Transparent <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2020/11/21/making-postgres-stored-procedures-9x-faster-in-citus/">stored procedure call delegation</a> by co-locating with a table in a distributed schema.</li> <li>Can manage all schemas via transactions.</li> </ul> <p>And with all the flexibility that PostgreSQL and Citus already offer, the overall list of benefits can go on for a while.</p> <p>Of course, everything in distributed databases is ultimately still a trade-off. One thing to consider is that having a very large number of schemas (or rather, tables) can create certain performance issues in PostgreSQL. For instance, each process keeps a separate catalog cache, which can cause high memory consumption when there are many tables. We recommend carefully considering your sharding model if you expect to have over 10k schemas. Queries and transactions that span multiple schemas may also be slower than on a single PostgreSQL node, and may incur certain <a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/stable/develop/reference_workarounds.html">SQL limitations</a>.</p> <h2 id="choosing-a-sharding-model-for-multi-tenant-saas-apps">Choosing a sharding model for multi-tenant SaaS applications</h2> <p>Schema-based sharding is only applicable if your application naturally divides into distinct groups of tables. For applications with a single large table (e.g. IoT measurements), row-based sharding is the obvious choice. However, for multi-tenant applications, row-based sharding (by tenant ID) and schema-based sharding (with a schema per tenant) are both very reasonable options, with different characteristics.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.citusdata.com/assets/images/blog/marco-blog-diagram-citus12-fig4.png" width="800" height="822" loading="lazy" alt="schema-based vs row-based sharding"> <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong>Side-by-side comparison of Schema-based sharding vs. Row-based sharding.

Tables do not have any restrictions with regards to constraints or foreign keys, except that foreign keys should not cross the schema boundary, unless they are foreign keys to reference tables. Schema-based sharding works especially well to scale applications that have many large tenants but might see performance degradation with a very large number of tenants (&gt;10k).</p> <p><strong>Row-based sharding</strong>: The data from all tenants is in the same set of tables. Each table has a tenant ID column (or equivalent) which acts as the distribution column. Tables are co-located such that the same tenant ID lives on the same node, across different tables. Primary keys, foreign keys, joins, and filter should include the tenant ID column to ensure operations can be evaluated locally. Very large tenants should be <a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/v11.3/develop/api_udf.html#isolate-tenant-to-new-shard">isolated to their own shard</a>.</p> <p>A high-level comparison of these sharding models (in the context of multi-tenant applications) is given below:</p> <div> <table><thead> <tr> <th></th> <th><strong>Schema-based sharding</strong></th> <th><strong>Row-based sharding</strong></th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Multi-tenancy model</strong></td> <td>Separate schema per tenant</td> <td>Shared tables with tenant ID columns</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Citus version</strong></td> <td>12.0+</td> <td>All versions</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Additional steps compared to vanilla PostgreSQL</strong></td> <td>None, only a config change</td> <td>Use create_<wbr>distributed_<wbr>table on each table to distribute &amp; co-locate tables by tenant ID</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Number of tenants</strong></td> <td>1-10k</td> <td>100-1M+</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Data modelling requirement</strong></td> <td>No foreign keys across distributed schemas.</td> <td>Need to include a tenant ID column and use it as the a distribution column in each table, and include it in primary keys, foreign keys.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>SQL requirement for single node queries</strong></td> <td>Use a single distributed schema per query.</td> <td>Joins and WHERE clauses should include tenant_id column</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Parallel cross-tenant queries</strong></td> <td>No</td> <td>Yes</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Custom table definitions per tenant</strong></td> <td>Yes</td> <td>No</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Access control</strong></td> <td>Schema permissions</td> <td>Row-level security</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Data sharing across tenants</strong></td> <td>Yes, using reference tables (in a separate schema)</td> <td>Yes, using reference tables</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Tenant to shard isolation</strong></td> <td>Every tenant has its own shard group by definition</td> <td>Can give specific tenant IDs their own shard group via <a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/en/stable/develop/api_udf.html#isolate-tenant-to-new-shard">isolate_<wbr>tenant_<wbr>to_<wbr>new_shard</a></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </div> <p>Which model to choose depends on your requirements. The biggest benefit of schema-based sharding is ease-of-use; no additional data modelling steps are required, only a single setting change. If you have a smaller number of large tenants (B2B), and some require a custom table definition or permissions, then schema-based sharding is also a great fit. If you have a very large number of small tenants (B2C) and want to simplify schema management and cross-tenant queries, then row-based sharding is likely to be a better fit.</p> <p>If you need both, then consider that nothing prevents you from using one set of distributed tables for small tenants with row-based sharding, and separate distributed schemas for large tenants.</p> <h2 id="migrating-an-existing-schema-per-tenant-app-to-citus">Migrating an existing schema-per-tenant application to Citus</h2> <p>One more thing… if you already have an existing PostgreSQL application that uses a schema per tenant, then you can easily migrate into a Citus cluster that uses schema-based sharding using <a href="https://github.com/dimitri/pgcopydb">pgcopydb</a>, a powerful open-source database migration tool created by my colleague Dimitri Fontaine.</p> <p>To see it in action, make sure <code>citus.enable_schema_based_sharding = on</code> is in your postgresql.conf and then run:</p> <div><pre><code>pgcopydb clone <span>--source</span> <span>"host=source.host"</span> <span>--target</span> <span>"host=target.host"</span> <span>--restart</span> <span>--drop-if-exists</span> <span>--skip-extensions</span>
</code></pre></div> <p>You can also use the <code>--follow</code> option to replay writes that happen during the migration to avoid downtime. You should not make schema changes or create/drop schemas during the migration. We do recommend extensively testing your application before switching over, and reporting any issues via the <a href="https://github.com/citusdata/citus">Citus GitHub repo</a>.</p> <h2 id="merge-improvements">Extending the MERGE superpower in Citus 12</h2> <p>Schema-based sharding is super exciting and the biggest enhancement in Citus 12, but we also continue to improve Citus for other scenarios, including row-based multi-tenancy and Internet-of-things (IoT) scenarios.</p> <p>PostgreSQL 15 introduced the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-merge.html">MERGE command</a>, which is especially useful when you receive a batch of records and you not only want to insert new records, but also update or delete existing records.</p> <p>For instance, consider the following IoT scenario where we want to maintain a table of “active alerts” based on incoming measurements:</p> <div><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>table</span> <span>alerts</span> <span>(</span>

</code></pre></div> <p>What’s new in Citus 12 is that this MERGE works even though the measurements table and the active_alerts table are not co-located (their distribution columns do not match). The MERGE will re-partition the data across the cluster on the fly, in one parallel, distributed transaction. That makes MERGE the most advanced distributed database command available in Citus.</p> <p>If you use MERGE in combination with schema-based sharding, then it will be fully pushed down to the node that stores the schema and handled by PostgreSQL.</p> <h2>Start building scalable apps</h2> <p>Schema-based sharding in Citus 12 gives you a new and easy way to scale out your PostgreSQL database. Whether you are an ISV building a multi-tenant SaaS application, microservices, or a complex OLTP workload that can use vertical partitioning, you can now easily tell Citus how to distribute the database by grouping tables into schemas without any special syntax. There are various application development libraries that will help you do this, but you can also easily build it yourself through simple commands like <code>SET search_path TO &lt;schema name&gt;</code> or using variables schema names in your queries.</p> <p>To learn even more about what Citus 12.0 can do for you:</p> <ul> <li>Check out the <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/updates/v12-0/">12.0 Updates page</a> if you want to read through the detailed release notes</li> <li>Join the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3UPL-EVwKA">Livestream of the Citus 12.0 Release Party, with demos</a>: The livestream will include a demo of schema-based sharding and is happening on Wed 02 Aug @ 9:00am PDT (<a href="https://www.addevent.com/event/oq18048843">mark your calendar</a>.)</li> </ul> <p>And if you want to get started distributing Postgres with Citus, the links in the bullets below should be useful:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/citusdata/citus">Citus open source repo on GitHub</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.citusdata.com/getting-started/">Getting started page for Citus</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.citusdata.com/download/">Download Citus open source</a></li> <li><a href="https://docs.citusdata.com/">Citus open source docs</a></li> <li><a href="https://slack.citusdata.com/">Join the Citus Public Slack</a></li> <li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/postgresql/quickstart-create-portal">Quickstart docs for Citus on Azure</a>, now known as Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL… Since Citus 12.0 is just released, it is not yet available on Azure but it will be soon.

<p dir="auto">Large language models (LLMs) have shown huge success in different text generation tasks and
enable developers to build generative agents based on objectives expressed in natural language.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, most generative agents require heavy customization for specific purposes, and
supporting different use cases can sometimes be overwhelming using existing tools
and frameworks. As a result, it is still very challenging to build a custom generative agent.</p>
<p dir="auto">In addition, evaluating such generative agents, which is usually done by manually trying different scenarios, is a very manual, repetitive, and expensive task.</p>
<p dir="auto">AutoChain takes inspiration from LangChain and AutoGPT and aims to solve
both problems by providing a lightweight and extensible framework
for developers to build their own agents using LLMs with custom tools and
<a href="#workflow-evaluation">automatically evaluating</a> different user scenarios with simulated
conversations. Experienced user of LangChain would find AutoChain is easy to navigate since
they share similar but simpler concepts.</p>
<p dir="auto">The goal is to enable rapid iteration on generative agents, both by simplifying agent customization and evaluation.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How does AutoChain simplify building agents?</h2>
<p dir="auto">AutoChain aims to provide a lightweight framework and simplifies the agent building process in a few
ways, as compared to existing frameworks</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Easy prompt update<br>
Engineering and iterating over prompts is a crucial part of building generative
agent. AutoChain makes it very easy to update prompts and visualize prompt
outputs. Run with <code>-v</code> flag to output verbose prompt and outputs in console.</li>
<li>Up to 2 layers of abstraction<br>
As part of enabling rapid iteration, AutoChain chooses to remove most of the
abstraction layers from alternative frameworks</li>
<li>Automated multi-turn evaluation<br>
Evaluation is the most painful and undefined part of building generative agents. Updating the agent to better perform in one scenario often causes regression in other use cases. AutoChain
provides a testing framework to automatically evaluate agent's ability under different
user scenarios.</li>
</ol>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Example usage</h2>
<p dir="auto">If you have experience with LangChain, you already know 80% of the AutoChain interfaces.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Workflow Evaluation</h2>
<p dir="auto">It is notoriously hard to evaluate generative agents in LangChain or AutoGPT. An agent's behavior
is nondeterministic and susceptible to small changes to the prompt or model. As such, it is
hard to know what effects an update to the agent will have on all relevant use cases.</p>
<p dir="auto">The current path for
evaluation is running the agent through a large number of preset queries and evaluate the
generated responses. However, that is limited to single turn conversation, general and not
specific to tasks and expensive to verify.</p>
<p dir="auto">To effectively evaluate agents, AutoChain introduces the workflow evaluation framework
which simulates the conversation between a generative agent and simulated users with LLM under
different user contexts and desired outcomes of the conversation. This way, we could add test
cases for different user scenarios and use LLMs to evaluate if multi-turn conversations reached
the desired outcome.</p>
<p dir="auto">To facilitate agent evaluation, AutoChain introduces the workflow evaluation framework. This framework runs conversations between a generative agent and LLM-simulated test users. The test users incorporate various user contexts and desired conversation outcomes, which enables easy addition of test cases for new user scenarios and fast evaluation. The framework leverages LLMs to evaluate whether a given multi-turn conversation has achieved the intended outcome.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to run workflow evaluations</h3>
<p dir="auto">You can either run your tests in interactive mode, or run the full suite of test cases at once.
<code>autochain/workflows_evaluation/conversational_agent_eval /change_shipping_address_test.py</code> contains a few example test cases.</p>
<p dir="auto">To run all the cases defined in a test file:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python autochain/workflows_evaluation/conversational_agent_eval/change_shipping_address_test.py"><pre>python autochain/workflows_evaluation/conversational_agent_eval/change_shipping_address_test.py</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To run your tests interactively <code>-i</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python autochain/workflows_evaluation/conversational_agent_eval/change_shipping_address_test.py -i"><pre>python autochain/workflows_evaluation/conversational_agent_eval/change_shipping_address_test.py -i</pre></div>

I’ve only ever sold online video courses where you typically start the checkout process and digitally purchase an item within a few seconds or minutes.</p><p>I was helping a friend out recently and worked the counter at a pizza place for a couple of weeks after my normal job. It’s a much different world than doing remote programming and making YouTube videos. I’ll likely make more posts related to this in a programming context but let’s focus on payments in this one.</p><h3 id="placing-an-order-for-pickup">Placing an Order for Pickup</h3><p>Check out this run of the mill workflow that may happen many times a day:</p><ol><li>Customer calls in on the phone to place an order for pickup</li><li>They want to buy a large lightly cooked pie and 6 garlic knots</li><li>You input their order into the POS (point of sale) system</li><li>Each item is listed as a line item with a name, quantity, note and price</li><li>You ask for their name and number and put it into the system</li><li>A total is calculated with sales tax being a separate line item</li><li>The order gets “Created” and the following things happen:<ul><li>The order is placed into “In Progress” with a little icon showing it’s not paid for<ul><li>Being paid or not is independent of the order being in progress</li></ul></li><li>A receipt is printed at the register which is marked “INCOMPLETE”<ul><li>You hang this receipt up so you and others know an order is pending</li></ul></li><li>An order to make 1 pie is printed where the pizza maker can see it</li></ul></li></ol><p>Step 7 is going to be different depending on which POS system you use but the general ideas are the same. There’s the concept of an order being in the system with a status, a human workflow is executed to track that order physically and receipts get printed.</p><p>At no point did we even think about capturing a payment here. For this pickup order there’s a few ways a payment can be collected:</p><ul><li>While on the phone with the customer you enter their credit card details into the system on their behalf, with our above workflow that could have been done after step 6 and then step 7 would be different but let’s put that on hold for now</li><li>They pay for it with either cash or credit when they pick it up</li></ul><p><em>For now we’re also ignoring other types of ways for orders to be input such as them ordering it online and paying for it on the spot or a delivery which could either be paid for and done online or have cash collected upon delivery. More on that later!</em></p><p>Ok so now let’s say the customer comes in 20 minutes from now to pick up their order. At this point you may have accepted 10 other orders from different customers. Some might be in progress and others might be completed. Maybe someone popped in to buy 2 slices to go and was in and out in 3 minutes.</p><p>You check the receipts that are hanging and notice this order is #137, so you go back to the POS system’s “In Progress” tab and find that order. Yep there it is.</p><p>You can see the full total of the order and see if the customer has cash out or a card (or their phone if they’re using Apple / Google Pay). If not, you ask them cash or card and the POS system will let you choose which one.</p><p>If they pick cash, you input the amount they give you and it auto-calculates their change. If they pick card or another digital payment method, they can use the terminal to tap or insert their card / device. It will get authorized and then hopefully be successful unless their card has issues.</p><p>In any case, if the payment is successful then the following happens:</p><ul><li>The order is marked as “Completed” in the system</li><li>Another receipt is printed except with payment information filled in</li><li>You save the receipt if the business owner wants physical receipts saved</li><li>You remove and throw away the hung “INCOMPLETE” receipt so you know it’s done</li></ul><p><em>The pizza maker threw away their print out for that pie independently of the order being completed. From their POV, they are finished when the pie is first placed IN the oven or OUT depending on if the counter workers know how to gauge when a pie is ready to be taken out.</em></p><p>At this point you have a clean slate. The order is complete and it’s been moved through the workflow. Depending on how busy the place is, this might be executed 50 or even 300 times a day with surges coming in around popular lunch and dinner times.</p><p>If you need to go back to an order that’s already been completed you can. You can also print receipts on demand and if there’s been a payment captured you can issue a full or partial refund.</p><p>There’s so much more to go into around payment details but let’s go over a few technical takeaways from the above.</p><h4 id="technical-takeaways">Technical Takeaways</h4><p>Here’s a couple of things I got out of the above and remember thinking about while taking orders and observing the system. If you were building this system out think about the database terms and relationships you might have.</p><p>I’ve quoted the words that could be tables or models.</p><h5 id="an-order-product-and-payment-are-different-things">An “Order”, “Product” and “Payment” are different things</h5><p>An order really pulls together multiple products into something that can be associated as a thing but in my opinion it’s not a join-table between products and payments.</p><p>Order #137 has N products. It also has X payments where X can even be 0 if the order happens to be free, such as if they have a coupon to get 1 free pie after buying 10.</p><p>You would still want that free pie to be put through the workflow and tracked. The only difference is you wouldn’t collect a payment.</p><p>An order has a status to clearly show the stage an order is at. You can almost think of it as a Kanban board that moves from created to completed.</p><h5 id="a-product-has-variants-and-notes">A “Product” has “Variants” and “Notes”</h5><p>At this place a pie can be personal (12”), medium (16”) or large (18”). A customer may want full pepperonis or meatballs. Maybe they want 1/2 and 1/2, or maybe they want 2 full toppings.</p><p>The pie can also have no notes or something specific that the customer wants such as lightly cooked, crispy or well done.</p><p>A variant and note are different things. A variant is something the customer can choose when making the purchase and it may or may not affect the price. Variants are standard things (T-shirt size, etc.) and notes are ADHOC customer requests.</p><p>If enough customers have the same request, maybe that’s a sign you can turn it into a variant but not always. For example, if 90% of people are ok with a normally cooked pizza you may not want to explicitly ask them to choose between regular, light, crispy or well done since it complicates the order process especially if it’s online where they are clicking form fields.</p><p>On the other hand, requiring them to pick large or personal is a good idea since those are different product variants with different prices. However if you were selling shirts you’d likely want colors as a variant even if they don’t adjust the price.</p><h5 id="a-receipt-is-immutable">A “Receipt” is immutable</h5><p>A receipt is created at a specific point in time and it reflects the details at that point in time. It may or may not be printed.</p><p>That’s a very important distinction because even if you didn’t print out orders onto paper you wouldn’t want to modify old orders with different details based on future events.</p><p>For example, if a pie costs $16.95 right now and you have 1,000 orders that happened in the past at that price and then bump your pie to $17.95 you can’t go back and adjust all of those previous orders to have $17.95.</p><p>No way right? The payment was already collected for $16.95 and it’s a done deal.</p><p>That means you shouldn’t have something like a reference to a product’s foreign key to dynamically grab the price when you render the receipt. Just about everything about that receipt should be denormalized, AKA. the details about the receipt are all self contained in that 1 row. It should be an individually rendered thing with its own separate data.</p><h3 id="placing-orders-in-multiple-ways">Placing Orders in Multiple Ways</h3><p>In the above example we handled the use case of a single counter worker entering in an order through the POS system but that’s not the only way orders can be collected.</p><p>If your POS system is integrated with a website or app, customers can place orders online. They still need to come up into your system as “In Progress”. In this case the order isn’t “Completed” yet but the payment was captured.</p><p>Online orders still get receipts hung because the hanging receipt is an indicator to let workers know if a customer received their order. It’s fully independent of a payment being captured or not.</p><p>Additionally, orders can be placed through DoorDash which may or may not even integrate with your POS system. If not, you might get the DoorDash order through a different system but the idea of hanging a receipt while incomplete can still hold true.</p><p>Lastly if we go back to someone taking an order at the pizza shop there could technically be multiple POS systems and multiple terminals to accept credit card payments.</p><p>Each POS system should sync its orders and statuses to each other otherwise you may have conflicting information which will get very confusing. Other than that, it’s the same as our original plan of taking orders at the register. The hanging receipt workflow holds true.</p><h4 id="technical-takeaways-1">Technical Takeaways</h4><p>In the DoorDash case, it’s an interesting idea in that 2 different systems or inputs can still funnel into the same workflow for ensuring an order is fulfilled. In the DoorDash case all orders are already paid for, you’re only keeping track when someone will pick it up. Them picking it up and marking the order as picked up on their phone is the action to complete the order on our end.</p><p>That opens the door for a POS system to integrate with third party order collection systems such as DoorDash. There is a benefit of your POS system being aware of DoorDash so orders get shown in the same place.</p><p>At the place I worked at they were separate. It meant keeping track of 2 different iPad screens and the DoorDash system didn’t even have a printer so we had to write orders out by hand to hang them. Hooking up a receipt printer for DD is a short term TODO item for them.</p><p>The real takeaway here is thinking about separation of concerns, abstractions and the flexibility that’s available when you have decoupled systems. Having DD integration would be a nice quality of live improvement but it’s not a necessity.</p><p>The pizza maker on the back-end doesn’t even need to think about this detail. They just know they have to make a specific type of pizza before X time.</p><h3 id="multiple-payments-per-order">Multiple Payments Per Order</h3><p>Most orders will be either cash or credit on their own but technically someone can pay with both cash and credit. This happened on the first day I was there where someone had a $14 order but they paid with both a gift card and the rest was cash.</p><p>Separate to that you may need to collect additional payments after a transaction has been completed. For example, someone places an order online for a regular pie with a custom note that says “Add buffalo chicken topping”.</p><p>Some folks do this on purpose in hopes to get a $5.50 topping for free. They should have chosen that as a topping through the menu system and it would have been calculated into the total before they paid.</p><p>Others make honest mistakes. Perhaps they’re not used to using online menus and didn’t notice the toppings section or the POS system’s software for online ordering isn’t ideal and didn’t make this noticeable enough.</p><p>In cases like this we’ll go back into the order and then charge an extra $5.50 onto their card. The POS allows you to add $X to an order as long as it’s under a certain amount (I think it’s based on a percent). In almost all cases this can be done without contacting the customer.</p><p>95%+ of the time this is fine and it’s what the customer wants. We always let them know when they pick it up or deliver it that we made the adjustment and it’s on the receipt. They are fully aware of the charge when they receive their food.</p><p>In the very off chance they don’t want the extra charge for the topping they ordered we refund them for just the topping’s charge and either give them a regular pie or let them keep the topping for free. It really depends on the situation.</p><p>Most business owners are ok with making you happy but if you try to take advantage of the situation and do this all the time they will notice and if you continue to abuse the system they may choose not to do business with you anymore.</p><h4 id="technical-takeaways-2">Technical Takeaways</h4><p>A way to describe all of this is an order has many payments. When displaying orders or showing receipts make sure that each payment method has its own line item.</p><h3 id="extra-charges-tips-and-discounts">Extra Charges, Tips and Discounts</h3><p>Besides collecting payments after the initial transaction you may want to add additional charges before a transaction. This is done by clicking an “Extra charge” link near the total and then adding in the amount.</p><p>For example, there’s a $2 delivery charge that gets added to all orders marked as delivery.</p><p>There’s also scenarios where someone may request a custom order that doesn’t have a comparable menu item. Sometimes it makes sense to ring someone up for the closest menu item and then add an extra charge.</p><p>For example, an order of meatballs comes with (2) meatballs and there’s no way to order (1) meatball, so if someone wants (3) meatballs we may ring them up as (2) but then add an extra charge.</p><p>If they have a truly custom order the POS system also has an option to add an ADHOC item with a custom name, quantity and price. This isn’t an extra charge, it’s basically creating a 1 off menu item just for that 1 order.</p><p>Tips are basically extra charges with their own name. It’s important to be able to see “Tip” on the receipt in the expected spot. The credit card terminal allows someone to enter in no tip, a few common percents or a custom amount. There’s also a jar to collect cash tips. I was surprised at how many folks add tips even if they pick the order up themselves.</p><p>There’s also a way to reduce an order’s total with a discount. That’s done by clicking an “Add discount” link. You can choose to apply a fixed amount or percent off discount.</p><p>This may be through the customer having a coupon such as $3 off any pie or maybe the business owner gives a 5% discount on a large bulk order and also waives the delivery fee.</p><h4 id="technical-takeaways-3">Technical Takeaways</h4><p>It’s worth it to support both fixed and percent based discounts. I saw a number of both being applied in a short while and I do the same with courses. In the end a percent based discount applies a fixed amount discount so it’s not too bad to implement.</p><p>It should be easy to create custom items with a name and price for when the situation comes up. If a big order comes in, you don’t want to be struggling to figure out how to do it on the spot. If you’re sure it will happen, IMO it’s worth coding that feature up.</p><p>Likewise with courses, this comes up when organizations want to buy a team license. I ended up creating a custom package for the course for let’s say 25 licenses which goes through the normal checkout process. I have a couple of preset license amounts but I can add a custom amount too.</p><h3 id="voids-and-refunds">Voids and Refunds</h3><p>Once in a while you may create an order that hasn’t received a payment yet and you want to cancel it. This could happen if let’s say you’ve made a menu adjustment on the back-end of the POS system and you want to ensure the price is up to date on the front-end.</p><p>Their specific POS system will auto-create an order as soon as you select any item. Personally I don’t like this but that’s how it is. It makes training more difficult because there’s no training mode and you have to create an order.</p><p>In those cases you can cancel or void the order. It still shows up as an order, except it’s been canceled with no payment. This audit trail is useful to help business owners protect themselves from employees ringing up orders, canceling them and then pocketing the cash.</p><p>Both partial and full refunds can happen on any order that has a payment. Sometimes you may need to refund someone for 1 specific item or the whole order. In our case we can also add a note to the refund so we and the customer know why.</p><p>All of this gets reflected back onto a new receipt that gets printed out.</p><h4 id="technical-takeaways-4">Technical Takeaways</h4><p>Generally speaking when dealing with money having more information is better than less. You want an audit trail covering every event. You should be able to trace through your events to recreate an order backwards and forwards.</p><p>Stripe does a very good job with this if you’ve ever used them before. You usually have multiple events being tied into a specific payment. The time lines all match up and the event data (JSON) is locked in at the time it occurred.</p><h3 id="customers">Customers</h3><p>It’s useful to collect information such as at least the first name of someone who is picking up an order so it can be added to the receipt.</p><p>Having their phone number is handy too in case you need to call them to remind them to pick up their order or if something unexpected happens.</p><p>This is especially important for deliveries. For example, you might be delivering an order to an airport but the airport has 5 different terminals. Maybe the person who took the order over the phone didn’t get the details on where to go.</p><p>In this case the delivery driver can call the customer and arrange where to meet.</p><p>At this place they have a separate caller ID box that gets the name, number and address of the caller. It’s pretty handy. It’s not always correct or available but when it works it saves a good amount of time.</p><p>One thing I learned is it’s hard to hear things when folks have really bad phone habits and the store is busy. Also, trying to get a full address from someone who might be drunk is no easy task! Automating as much of this as possible helps.</p><p>Customer information gets saved too, this way if the same number is input again, the address is auto-filled out. Of course with mobile phones it’s possible that an address can change so we always ask them to confirm their address but again, 95%+ of the time this is a nice time saver.</p><p>Besides that, it helps business owners learn more about who likes what. If you know someone always orders similar pizzas every week then you can ask them “Hi Terry, do you want it lightly cooked like last time?”. This builds a nice rapport.</p><h4 id="technical-takeaways-5">Technical Takeaways</h4><p>Automating data input when possible is good but if it’s important you should always confirm it with another human on the other side. In this case a delivery to the wrong address is a really poor outcome.</p><p>For online orders outside of this pizza place, things like pre-filling a user’s state and zip code from a geo-location service is nice but allow the user to edit this information too. Especially if it’s for shipping an order.</p><h3 id="stripe-shopify-and-square">Stripe, Shopify and Square</h3><p>If you squint hard enough at this post related to “Order”, “Product” and “Customer” objects, this isn’t too different than <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://shopify.dev/docs/api" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Shopify</a> and <a href="https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Square’s</a> APIs to accept payments for digital and physical goods.</p><p>Of course, this post only scratches the surface of what to think about. I wrote this post because I was excited about what I learned briefly working at a pizza place. I love thinking about optimizing workflows and self improvement.</p><p>I’m literally the definition of the “will work for pizza” meme but in a good way.</p><p>Seriously though, it really opened my eyes at how important a good user experience is, especially under pressure at a decently busy place. Every action should have a purpose and if there’s spots where you can forget something or you have to think about it, that’s a good opportunity to see how you can refine the workflow to make it seamless.</p><p>Personally if I were building a POS system I’d use their APIs as inspiration or even use one of them directly. Modern day POS systems can end up being basically an iPad mounted onto a register.</p><p>I can’t believe how much I learned about decomposing the problem of “taking orders” just by being in a physical location for a bit and getting into the thick of it. I highly encourage anyone to experience this for a bit at least once in their life.</p><p>So that’s about it in terms of payments. The video below goes into similar detail as this post with a bit more detail and personal asides.</p><h3 id="video">Video</h3><p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YSUxLRlTzZ4??rel=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;controls=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"> </iframe></p><h4 id="timestamps">Timestamps</h4><ul><li>2:06 – Placing an order for pickup</li><li>9:48 – Technical takeaways for picking up an order</li><li>16:02 – Placing orders in multiple ways</li><li>18:31 – Technical takeaways for placing orders in different ways</li><li>20:37 – Multiple payments per order</li><li>25:09 – Voids and refunds</li><li>27:38 – Technical takeaways for refunds</li><li>28:44 – Customers</li><li>31:27 – Technical takeaways about customers</li><li>32:02 – Using Stripe, Shopify and Square’s API as inspiration</li><li>33:38 – Will work for pizza</li></ul><p><strong>What are your payment related takeaways when working at a register?

Some of the worst provisions had been </span><a href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/california-adopts-controversial-new-math-framework-heres-whats-in-it/2023/07'" rel="">thankfully watered down</a><span>, but the basic strategy of trying to delay the teaching of subjects like algebra remained. It’s a sign that the so-called “progressive” approach to math education championed by people like Stanford’s Jo Boaler has not yet engendered a critical mass of pushback. </span></p><p><span>And meanwhile, the idea that teaching kids less math will create “equity” has spread far beyond the Golden State. The city of Cambridge, Massachusetts </span><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/07/14/metro/cambridge-schools-divided-over-middle-school-math/" rel="">recently removed algebra</a><span> and all advanced math from its junior high schools, on similar “equity” grounds.</span></p><p><span>It is difficult to find words to describe how bad this idea is without descending into abject rudeness. The idea that offering children fewer educational resources through the public school system will help the poor kids catch up with rich ones, or help the Black kids catch up with the White and Asian ones, is unsupported by any available evidence of which I am aware. More fundamentally, though, it runs counter to </span><em>the whole reason that public schools exist in the first place</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>The idea behind universal public education is that all children — or almost all, making allowance for those with severe learning disabilities — are fundamentally </span><em>educable</em><span>. It is the idea that there is some set of subjects — reading, writing, basic mathematics, etc. — that essentially all children can learn, if sufficient resources are invested in teaching them. </span></p><p><span>Before public education — one of the key crusades of the original Progressive movement — only private actors invested resources in educating children. Families taught their kids skills, rich families hired tutors, companies trained their workers, churches provided some classes, etc. But it was a threadbare, uneven patchwork. Worse, it was highly </span><em>unequal</em><span> — if you weren’t born to a family with lots of time and/or money to spare, you didn’t get nearly as much education. This led to inequality throughout society, as well as the preservation of intergenerational wealth. Furthermore, it wasted much of society’s productive potential, because the unlucky kids weren’t learning as many useful skills as they could have been.</span></p><p><span>Universal public education was a way to attack all of these problems at once. By investing state resources in childhood education, it not only boosted human capital and economic growth, it eroded inequality of birth and circumstance. Teachers, hired by the state, provided some of what poor kids’ families couldn’t provide. Everyone except for a very few fringe ideologues now agrees that this model was a success; public education is pretty much universally believed to be </span><a href="https://gpseducation.oecd.org/revieweducationpolicies/#!node=41761&amp;filter=all" rel="">a key input</a><span> into economic development, and plenty of research supports that notion that it fosters </span><a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/invest-public-education-increase-intergenerational-mobility" rel="">intergenerational mobility</a><span> as well. It is not a perfect equalizer and never will be, but it is one of the more important equalizers that exist in our society. </span></p><p><span>When you ban or discourage the teaching of a subject like algebra in junior high schools, what you are doing is </span><em>withdrawing state resources</em><span> from public education. There is a thing you could be teaching kids how to do, but instead you are refusing to teach it. In what way is refusing to use state resources to teach children an important skill “progressive”? How would this further the goal of equity?</span></p><p>I can easily see one (very twisted) perspective that might lead someone to think it would do so. If you take a strongly “hereditarian” view toward education, then you believe that inborn mental ability — what we typically call “IQ” — determines most of what people can and can’t learn. If you are a strong hereditarian, then perhaps you believe that students who don’t learn algebra well are simply born without the cognitive ability to learn it. </p><p><span>And if you believe </span><em>that</em><span>, then you might conclude that the only way to create equity in society would be to handicap the kids who were born with the ability to learn algebra. Like the Handicapper General in Kurt Vonnegut’s satirical sci-fi short story “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Bergeron" rel="">Harrison Bergeron</a><span>”, you might try to kneecap the opportunities of the kids you believed to be the genetic elite. In doing so, you would then become a living, breathing embodiment of this meme that </span><em>opponents</em><span> of equity created in order to ridicule the whole idea:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg" width="960" height="576" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:576,&quot;width&quot;:960,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:181548,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473ccca-46a0-4e82-88fa-6ec558b7ca8f_960x576.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Now, if you went up and asked “progressive” educators like Jo Boaler if they believed in a version of hereditarianism so strong as to make </span><a href="https://twitter.com/charlesmurray/status/1680475688355217411" rel="">Charles Murray himself blush</a><span>, they would undoubtedly deny that they do. And I’m sure they don’t </span><em>consciously</em><span> think that math ability is all in the genes. But when you think about the idea of creating equity by restricting access to advanced math classes, it’s pretty much impossible to avoid the conclusion that the idea is to make all kids equal by making them equally unable to learn. </span></p><p><span>But whatever you think about the morality of this idea, it simply </span><em>will not work</em><span>. The reason is that </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6088505/" rel="">the strong hereditarian hypothesis is wrong</a><span>; practically all kids </span><em>are </em><span>educable, with the proper investment of resources. </span></p><p><span>I know this from personal experience. I was a math tutor for many years, in high school and college, and part of that was volunteer work tutoring poor Black and Hispanic kids. Guess what? They learned a lot of math! But this isn’t just my own anecdote; evidence </span><em>consistently shows</em><span> that tutoring is highly effective. </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27476" rel="">Nickow, Oreopoulos, and Quan (2020)</a><span> surveyed 96 studies using a variety of different tutoring approaches in a variety of different contexts. Here’s </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tutoring-a-time-tested-solution-to-an-unprecedented-pandemic/" rel="">a summary of what they found</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>We found that tutoring is remarkably effective at helping students learn, with over 80% of the 96 included studies reporting statistically significant effects. Averaging results across the studies included in this analysis, we found a pooled effect size of 0.37 standard deviations. In other words, with the help of tutoring, a student at the 50</span><sup>th</sup><span> percentile would improve to the 66</span><sup>th</sup><span> percentile. In the field of K-12 education research where there is little agreement on what works, these findings are remarkable not only for their magnitude but also for their consistency. The evidence is clear that tutoring can reliably help students catch up.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The effectiveness of tutoring can help us understand achievement gaps in math classes. Some students do well because of greater </span><em>preparation</em><span> — they show up already knowing much of the material, or having the general concepts in place to pick it up quickly. This is because they had a tutor at home growing up: </span><em>their parents</em><span>, who had the leisure time and educational background required to teach their kids some math. A few rich parents also hire private tutors, but the main tutors are almost always Mom and Dad.</span></p><p>Now imagine what will happen if we ban kids from learning algebra in public junior high schools. The kids who have the most family resources — the rich kids, the kids with educated parents, etc. — will be able to use those resources to compensate for the retreat of the state. Either their parents will teach them algebra at home, or hire tutors, or even withdraw them to private schools. Meanwhile, the kids without family resources will be out of luck; since the state was the only actor who could have taught them algebra in junior high, there’s now simply no one to teach them.

<p>10NES</p><hr>

<p>I am a big fan of Street Fighter 2. Certainly not the greatest but likely among the nerdiest since I wrote an entire book about its <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/cpsb_paper">platform</a><a name="back_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. It won't be a surprise to learn that, back in December 1992, I was eagerly waiting for the Super Nintendo port so I could stop sinking my rare 10 Francs coins into the arcades.
</p>
 
<p>USA readers may wonder why I was waiting for the release of a game already published. While Street Fighter II made it to the Super Famicom on June 10, 1992 in Japan and July 15, 1992 in North America, France had to wait until December 17, 1992 to get a PAL version.
</p>

<p>As I waited, I saw ads<a name="back_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> in French magazines<a name="back_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> offering imported cartridges of my Holy Graal. To make them work on a European Super Nintendo, one had to buy an adapter. The combo cost almost as much as the console (595F + 199F vs 1290F).</p>

<p>Needless to say I couldn't afford it. But I always wondered how Nintendo seemingly controlled the regions and how tinkerers had managed to circumvent that protection.</p>

<!-- <p>Luckily, the magic of the Internet happened. Over the past decades, curious people have connected, worked together, and solved the mystery. All I had to do was gather what was sprinkled all over the net.</p>  -->

<!-- <div class='heading'>A few decades later...</div><hr/><p>
A few weeks ago, I decided to take the time to understand the SNES locking and zoning. As I started my research, the magic of Internet operated.</p>

<p>As it turned out, the network had put in touch thousand of people over the past decades. Together, they worked out the details of most of my interrogations. All I had to do was spend a few hours gathering pieces of knowledge here and there.</p>

<p>This page merely concentrates what other have spend countless hours discovering and kindly shared.</p>

<p>10NES system and the CIC chip</p><hr><p>Nintendo's region and licensing system is named 10NES. At its heart is the chip known as "CIC" (Checking Integrated Circuit). On the following Super Nintendo motherboard it is recognizable via its F411A<a name="back_4" href="#footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> label.</p>

<p>CIC pinout</p><hr><p>The CIC chip features 16 pins but not all of them are used. The pinout, published on nesdev.org<a name="back_5" href="#footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a><a name="back_6" href="#footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>, allows us a glimpse into how it CIC works.</p>

<p>In the set of pins, we find standard ones such as power (+5V), a ground (GRD), a Clock (CLK) to breathe life into the silicone, and a Reset (RST).
</p>                 







<p>CIC on game cartridge</p><hr><p>
  To understand the other pins, we need to introduce the second part of the 10NES system, an identical CIC chip located on the game cartridge. In the following cart (used among other titles for Secret Of Mana), the CIC is on the right, labeled D411B.</p>

<p><b><u>Trivia:</u></b> A deeply satisfying exercise with hardware from the 90s is to follow the bus lines. Try to follow the <code>+5V (VCC)</code> <a href="https://www.caitsith2.com/snes/flashcart/cart-chip-pinouts.html">cart pin</a> and see how it makes its way to pin 16 (<code>+5V (VCC)</code>) on the CIC (hint: It goes through a resistor and a capacitor).


</p><p>The CIC Lock and Key</p><hr><p>The two CICs in the 10NES system are identical. Pin <code>04</code> (CONF) configures how a chip should behave. Grounding it makes it behave like a Key but connecting it to power makes it behave like a Lock. On every system it was used, the Lock is in the console and the Key is in the game cartridge.</p>

<p> The two I/O pins, <code>01</code> (OUT) and <code>02</code> (IN), are paired to each other so the chips can communicate. Since both CIC use the same <code>CLK</code>, they execute instructions in lockstep and are synchronized.</p>


<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/10nes/cic_duo_nofont.svg" width="489mm" height="271mm">

<p>Both the Lock and the Key generate a signal on their <code>OUT</code> pin and compare it to what is received on their <code>IN</code> pin. If it detects a discrepancy, the Lock asserts its <code>HST RST</code> (HoST ReSeT) pin which triggers a <code>RST</code> on the graphic chip PPU2. This signal is <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/10nes/snes_schematic.pdf">distributed</a> to all other components of the machine (CPU, PPU1, APU, DSP) every 1s making the overall system unusable.</p>

<p>RST pin</p><hr><p>The Lock's <code>RST</code> pin is directly connected to the console RESET button. When this pin is asserted, it automatically asserts <code>KEY RST</code> (pin <code>07</code>) which is connected to the <code>RST</code> pin of the Key CIC on the cartridge.</p>

<p>Seed</p><hr><p>To generate a pseudo random signal, the Lock needs a seed value. It is generated thanks to a capacitor connected to its <code>SEED</code> pin<a name="back_7" href="#footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>. The randomness comes from how long it takes for the capacitor to discharge. After it gets its seed value, the Lock sends it to the Key as part of the prologue (therefore the Key <code>SEED</code> pin is unused and grounded). After that both the Key and the Lock start issuing one of the 16 possible streams<a name="back_8" href="#footnote_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>On top of using the same <code>CLK</code> signal, both chips stay in sync via careful programming. They don't always take the same code path but developers made sure instructions of each branch take the same number of cycles<a name="back_9" href="#footnote_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>.





</p><p>CIC internals</p><hr><p>How the CIC internals were uncovered is a fascinating story which started in 2006 on forums.nesdev.org<a name="back_10" href="#footnote_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>. In short, researchers gave up on the official Nintendo CIC to instead study Tengen's copy called "Rabbit". They discovered a debug function prompting the mammal to output its ROM on its pins. What we learn from this thread is that the CIC is a 4-bit SM590 microcontroller made by Sharp<a name="back_11" href="#footnote_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>. It contains the following registers, RAM, and ROM.</p>

<p><b><u>Trivia:</u></b> The story of how the SNES CIC was understood is equally interesting<a name="back_13" href="#footnote_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>.
</p>




<p>Software Region lock (NTSC - PAL)</p><hr><p>With all this knowledge, we can understand how Region lock worked. Nintendo simply used a different CIC ROM for their NA console and the European cartridge games. Different programs generated different signals which made the Lock CIC <code>HST RST</code> loop trigger.</p>

<p>How did people circumvent that region lock then? One solution was to pry open a Super Nintendo and operate on the Lock CIC. Since the lethal trigger was the <code>HST RST</code> pin, a solution was to severe it and disconnect it from the motherboard. That would have worked but that would have also disabled the RESET button of the machine.</p>

<p> A better solution was to cut the <code>CONF</code> pin<a name="back_14" href="#footnote_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>. This made the Lock CIC behave like a Key CIC which never pulled the <code>HST RST</code> trigger.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/10nes/cic_surgery_no_font.svg" width="489mm" height="146mm">
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/10nes/adapter.webp">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/10nes/adapter.webp" width="1000" height="1000"></a>

<p>Modding a console was too much to ask from most customers. Not only gamers didn't have the skills, such modification voided the warranty.</p>

<p> Instead adapters, called "Game Converter" started to appear. The device would connect in the cartridge slot of the console and allow two cartridges to be inserted on its top. In the front row the player placed the import game they wanted to play. In the back row, they plugged a cart belonging to same region as the console (e.g. Super Mario World).</p>

<p>The converter worked by discarding the import game four CIC lines. Instead it rerouted the local game cart CIC pins to the console. The result was a Lock CIC chatting with a Key CIC of a local game but the console running the import game.
</p>




<p>Hardware Region lock (Japan - North America)</p><hr><p>To make Japan cartridges incompatible with North American consoles (and vice versa), Nintendo went with a "budget" solution. The US cartridge have a rectangular form which does not fit in a Japan Super Famicom cartridge slot.</p>

<p>Super Famicom games on the other hand can go in a North American SNES but it cannot be pushed all the way down. Two rails on the side prevent it. See in the photo below how SNES games have grooves on each side to allow the rails to go up<a name="back_15" href="#footnote_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>.</p>


<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/10nes/reg_hard.webp" width="1279" height="681"><span><i><small>

</small></i></span>

<p>These physical attributes are the only thing that prevent games cross-over between Japan and NA since the CIC chips are identical. All it took to defeat the "protection" was a screwdriver to remove a case (console or cart).</p>




<p>Circumventing Licensing</p><hr><p>Like the NES, the SNES had unlicensed games<a name="back_16" href="#footnote_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> but it is unclear to me how they happened. Some publishers may have used Tengen's Rabbit.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  


  <p>I recently read the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Impro-Improvisation-Theatre-Keith-Johnstone/dp/0878301178">Impro - Improvisation and the Theatre</a> by Keith Johnstone<sup id="fnref:vgr" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:vgr" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It’s a delightful book all about improvisational theatre and importantly <em>how to teach</em> improvisational theatre.</p>

<p>The book inspired me to draw many analogies between the improv actor and the consultant and I have written a five part series. They loosely flow in order but each can be read in any order:</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 1 - The Office is a Theatre for Work</strong>. This post looks at the central problem of “performing” work and how important it is for modern knowledge work - especially for the consultant. We end with some ideas around how to think on your feet without bullshitting.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/19/optimism-operating-system/">Chapter 2 - Optimism as an Operating System</a></strong>. This post highlights the tendency for consultants to be critical and to see everything as a problem. We’ll reframe this by showing the power of being positive - especially for long-term retainers.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/12/06/blocking-unblocking-clients/">Chapter 3 - Blocking &amp; Unblocking Clients</a></strong>. Here we think of clients as blocked actors and we take inspiration from the “Yes! and…” exercise to see how we can unblock clients to generate new strategies and creative thinking with clients.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/06/24/navigating-power-status/">Chapter 4 - Navigating Power &amp; Status</a></strong>. How to get things done inside organizations by understanding power potholes and status switching. We explore the concept of high status and low status and show how the consultant has to become adept at a new skill of “status switching” in order to be successful inside client organizations.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/08/18/the-fool/">Chapter 5 - The Contrary Consultant</a></strong>. Embracing the fool &amp; the power of not fitting in. We explore the identity of outsider and how to reconcile this with working inside client organizations.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-1---the-office-is-a-theatre-for-work">Chapter 1 - The Office is a Theatre for Work</h2>

<p>Which of these do you recognize?</p>

<p><em>Working on a detailed presentation only for the meeting to get derailed 5 slides in.</em></p>

<p><em>Ritually showing our face at our desks at the appropriate time to signal that we’re working.</em></p>

<p><em>Attending weekly status meetings to create the performance of keeping things moving.</em></p>

<p><em>Brainstorm sessions to create the illusion of inclusive creativity.</em></p>

<p><em>Workshops with scripted games and exercises and sticky notes to ensure everyone has a good time.</em></p>

<p><em>Jealousy of colleagues who don’t do good work but excel at presenting their work.</em></p>

<p><em>People who talk about their work getting promoted more than those that don’t.</em></p>

<p>Much of modern knowledge work is performance… In fact:</p>

<p><strong>The office is a theatre,  and work is an unfolding narrative on the stage.</strong></p>

<p>Many people aspire to “silent success” at work - to do work that “speaks for itself”. Unfortunately this is the wrong move in the theatre of work. Instead we should aspire to the opposite - <strong>for knowledge work, the performance of the work <em>is</em> the work.</strong></p>

<p>Because in truth - how else could it function?</p>

<p>Much as we might like to think of organizations as rational machines - the reality is that companies are social organizations and people interacting with people is the way decisions are made and how work gets done.</p>

<p>And in this theatre of human work it’s crucial to speak up. Spending time on the performance is not wasted - in fact quite the opposite.</p>

<p>Without performance work gets sidelined, ignored or worse:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Among more than 120 evaluation and program executives surveyed at private foundations the US and Canada, more than three-quarters had difficulty commissioning evaluations that result in meaningful insights for the field, their grantees, or the foundation itself, and 70% have found it challenging to incorporate evaluation results into the foundation’s future work. <strong>A survey of over 1600 civil servants in Pakistan and India found that “simply presenting evidence to policymakers doesn’t necessarily improve their decision-making,” with respondents indicating “that they had to make decisions too quickly to consult evidence and that they weren’t rewarded when they did.”</strong> - <a href="https://medium.com/@iandavidmoss/this-is-why-your-hard-work-sits-on-the-shelf-and-heres-what-to-do-about-it-a7ca5e063038">why your hard work sits on the shelf and what to do about it</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in fact <a href="https://twitter.com/round/status/892486242721554433">this excellent Twitter thread from Maxim</a> shows the value in caring deeply about the presentation and context of the work:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nobody ever picks the third, wacky, design direction.</p>— Maxim Leyzerovich (@round) <a href="https://twitter.com/round/status/892486242721554433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2017</a></blockquote>


<p>What does the “performance” of work look like?</p>

<p>Things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Presentations of your work</li>
  <li>Hallway chats</li>
  <li>1:1 conversations to build alignment</li>
  <li>Crafting the wrapper and positioning of your work</li>
  <li>Changing the language of your work to match others</li>
  <li>Including wider contexts of the organization, the industry and the market in your work</li>
  <li>Reformatting your presentations to fit other team’s strategies</li>
  <li>and much more…</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In the theatre of work the performance of work is intimately tied to the work itself.</strong></p>

<p>But many employees attempt to hide or ignore the performance of work and the politics of the organization. They imagine that this public sphere of voice and politics is wasted energy or somehow “unfair”<sup id="fnref:unfair" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:unfair" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="being-present-public-and-acting-with-voice">Being present, public and acting with voice</h2>

<p>If we think of the office as a theatre for work the <em>only</em> meaningful way forward is through this sphere of politics and voice. As Venkatesh Rao from Ribbonfarm outlines in his post <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/09/14/how-to-make-history/">how to make history</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>You do not appear in public through labor, let alone make history. Laboring humans are fungible as individuals, and only consequential actors with a political voice en masse</strong> (whether organized in egalitarian ways as a working class or non-egalitarian ways as a patriarchy, or ethno-nationalist clientelistic identity group). […]</p>

  <p><strong>If labor is about blending into the processes of nature, and making about interrupting and slowing it to create a durable world, action is about free behaviors that make history.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This ideas of “being public” and “exercising voice” both have relatively specific meanings in the Hannah Arendt sense and I’d encourage you to spend time reading here if you’re not familiar<sup id="fnref:arendt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:arendt" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Here are two examples that might help explain opportunities for being public and having voice:</p>

<p>Example #1: choosing to take a position on something that situates <strong>you</strong> in the company’s world. A great example of this is <a href="https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611">Steve Yegge’s platform rant</a>. Note how closely Steve is situated in the narrative here - it’s not simply an observation of the market but of taking a position on the world that situates Google, Amazon and Steve. This can feel daunting but ask yourself the last time you showed up in Slack to post something that has voice? To say something about the organization…</p>

<p>Example #2: asking questions in public forums (all-hands, quarterly business updates etc). These are opportunities where executives are inviting public voice - they’re asking for people to take positions and have opinions.</p>

<p>Of course there are an infinite number of other situations where voice and being public are possible<sup id="fnref:speech" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:speech" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>… but most employees would rather shy away from these instead of embracing them as part of the work.</p>

<p>Orchestrating performances for your work is the key to more influence and more impact.</p>

<h2 id="enter-stage-left-the-consultant">Enter Stage Left: The Consultant</h2>

<p>Ah, but so far what we’re describing is the reality of the working world. Now let’s situate the consultant in the theatre of work.</p>

<p>The luxury that full time employees gain is the ability to script and rehearse their performances - to plan ahead. The consultant is like an improv actor thrust into a play mid-performance, forced to find ways to fit in, go with the flow and steer the performance all while <em>on stage</em>.</p>

<p>For example - full time employees get the luxury of being involved in 2020 planning. <strong>Consultants are an outcome of 2020 planning</strong> and so get brought in mid-performance to course correct.</p>

<p>Consultants that attempt to halt the performance cause pain and typically don’t stick around. Instead consultants that accept and embrace their nature as improv actors thrive and become integrated into the great performance of the organization.</p>

<h2 id="the-theatre-of-work-is-an-improv-theatre">The Theatre of Work is an Improv Theatre</h2>

<p>As a consultant, attempting to tightly script and design the performance of the work will inevitably lead to <strong>missed timings, missed context or missed feedback</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Missed timings</strong> - As a consultant you’re often working less than 5-days a week with a client. So you’re slower than full-time employees. This means if you try and slow down to polish the performance of your work you can miss the window of opportunity. So the improv consultant must learn to un-polish, prototype and improvise in real-time just to keep up with the client’s organization.</p>

<p><strong>Missed context</strong> - Because you’re not a full-time employee (even if you’re working 5 days a week) you may not be included on all-hands emails, announcements and so on and so you always have to work hard to gain the full context of a client. <strong>Tightly scripting a performance doesn’t leave room for new contexts to emerge during the performance</strong>. Instead there should always be room for new context to emerge and get integrated into the performance in real-time.</p>

<p><strong>Missed feedback</strong> - <strong>It’s not uncommon as a consultant to be the most proficient powerpoint user in the org</strong> (or at least your portion of the org). This has benefits but it also has the unintended consequence of making everything you touch look “finished”. And finished work gets very different feedback from people than raw materials and thinking. So sometimes it’s important to un-design and un-polish your work, to invite people onto the stage to co-create the performance - this way you ensure that you get the appropriate feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Good consultants think of performances more like an unfolding series of improv sessions.</strong></p>

<p>Many organizations at the executive level already function like tight improv groups - reacting to implicit and explicit cues and playing off each other to make in-the-moment decisions.</p>

<p>As a consultant - this executive level improv troupe is where the real work gets done and where you’re aiming for. It’s the essence of why Venkatesh’s idea of client “sparring”<sup id="fnref:sparring" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sparring" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> is so appealing - because it embraces this verbal improv decision making that everyone recognizes.</p>

<p>So how does this idea of improv begin to shape our thinking? Some obvious ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We need to be present in the room. Where the performance of the work <em>is</em> the work we can’t leave the presentation and narrative of the work to others.</li>
  <li>Study the people as much as you study the organization. When you’re reacting to work mid-performance half of what you’re reacting to is the strategy and half of it is the set of relationships and biases of the people in the room.</li>
</ul>

<p>And one non-obvious idea:</p>

<h2 id="the-serendipity-deficit-of-consultants--manufacturing-improv-sessions">The Serendipity-Deficit of Consultants &amp; Manufacturing Improv Sessions</h2>

<p>A failure mode for employees is striving for work to happen in the official channels - to wait for the meeting to talk about the strategy, to wait for the email chain to pitch in. This desire to make work “official” means many employees are uncomfortable talking about their work on the way to the coffee shop or in the hallway between meetings.</p>

<p>But it’s exactly these free-form sessions when executives drop their guard, open up and the possibility to operate in a liminal space between contexts is possible.</p>

<p><strong>And the most important thing to understand about these “spontaneous” improv sessions is that they are most useful for laying the first seed of an idea. Good ideas don’t instantly make an impact and if you want executives to pay attention you have to make sure they hear the idea several times. So drop it first in the hallway before formalizing it in a meeting.</strong></p>

<p>Of course I say “spontaneous” because actually humans are remarkably predictable and it’s often trivial to engineer these serendipitous hallway conversations. And you <em>should</em> be manufacturing them.</p>

<p>Remember - if you’re a consultant in a client’s office two days a week you’re operating at a serendipity-deficit. You simply have less surface area to bump into people. So you have to cheat.</p>

<p>A fellow consultant friend brought up the idea of getting into the office early to deliberately catch the CEO on the way in the door before they settled into focus mode. To intercept them intentionally to create a small improv session. To lay the first seeds for ideas.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-think-on-your-feet-without-bullshitting">How to think on your feet without bullshitting</h2>

<p>Above all else however, you need to embrace a level of “thinking on your feet” - it’s essential to the consultant’s work and a consequence of being brought in mid-performance.</p>

<p>This “thinking on your feet” is about the balance between deflecting decisions for further analysis and providing the answer there and then.</p>

<p>Example: one of the most visible ways this manifests is the first day or week with a new client. Executives love to probe you with “difficult” questions - learning to provide an answer that you believe in but leaves room for revision later is key. The real game that’s being played here is not one of being right or wrong - it’s the executive asking two questions at once - firstly “how much do you know?” and secondly “can you improv?” to understand how useful you’re going to be in the theatre of work.</p>

<p><strong>Unfortunately -  in the theatre of work there’s a fine line between thinking on your feet and bullshitting…</strong></p>

<p>Who’s been in a meeting and been disgusted with people spouting things that are half-true, made-up or masks over the real truth?</p>

<p>There’s a fine line between reacting to a situation in the room and bullshitting.</p>

<p>As a consultant this is especially hard to avoid. Your default mode of operating is the liminal space between industries, businesses and markets. A few times a year I’m forced to learn something new from scratch. This forces us to work in spaces where we’re often the <em>least</em> knowledgeable about a specific business (even if we are <em>experts</em> in the industry… And sometimes we’re <em>experts</em> at a discipline but neither knowledgeable about the <em>business</em> or the <em>industry</em>).</p>

<p>So here’s a little guide to avoiding bullshit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Immerse yourself in the core business mechanics, you should be able to draw a diagram explaining the core business revenue &amp; profit function reasonably well. The more abstraction here the more you risk a fundamental mis-understanding and straying into BS.</li>
  <li>Become a language chameleon - study and adopt the language,  acronyms and buzzwords of the client’s business. If they call it “earned marketing” you should too. If their CMS is called PinkCloud you call it that too. Specificity allows you to avoid confusion and helps you distinguish between the client’s CMS and the market’s CMS (for example).</li>
  <li>Speak clearly and within your limits. Ask for clarification on points that don’t seem to make sense. No pretending. Don’t adopt the language too quickly! (ha, see how hard this is?)</li>
  <li>Ask stupid questions. Ask questions about company history, about alternative approaches, about failed previous ideas. Just because people at the client choose not to talk about obvious things doesn’t mean you shouldn’t.</li>
  <li>Defend your ideas but not your points. Be willing to defend your ideas even if some data points get challenged. It’s very common that the number or stat you’re using to support your point will be wrong but that the broader idea still holds. Don’t concede the idea but also don’t try and put muscle behind the numbers - accept they’re wrong but keep pressing on the idea to see where you get.</li>
  <li>When you get challenged pull out some counter-factuals - when someone is claiming that your data is wrong challenge them with proving the opposite.</li>
  <li>Keep your eye on the prize for business outcomes, not intellectual debates. Executives are fond of theorizing and debating ideas that stray into the get into the abstract - you can play this game a little but try to be the one to ground conversations in reality.</li>
  <li>Read widely - analogy is the core of cognition. Don’t be afraid to source things from different industries. This is the kind of cross-industry vantage point that clients find hard to get internally.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all ways to avoid bullshitting - but unfortunately there’s one simple way to avoid bullshit - by being critical.</p>

<p><strong>It’s far easier to retreat to the critical, negative position and say why things won’t or can’t work. Except… this is a mistake.</strong></p>

<p>Being positive and optimistic is far harder but more effective. And we’re going to talk about that in the next post…. <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/19/optimism-operating-system/">Optimism as an Operating System</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.appsmith.com/blog/write-a-great-readme">https://www.appsmith.com/blog/write-a-great-readme</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36773022">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a company, we have aspired to build an amazing open-source community for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.appsmith.com/">Appsmith</a>. To date, Appsmith's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith">Github page</a> has amassed over 28,000 stars and just under 3,000 forks. So what is the key to getting these numbers? It all starts with the all-important README. Your README is the front page for your project — it's often the first impression you make on your users and contributors. An effective README file needs to tell your audience what your project does, how to use it, and how they can help out.</p>
<p>We’ve optimized this by putting the information that’s most useful to the widest audience up front and slowly working our way down to the technical details, by linking to other sources whenever more detail is required to avoid walls of text, and by using visuals wherever possible. In this article, we’ll discuss in more detail how these three principles make a great README file for your project.</p>
<h2 id="principles-of-a-good-readme">Principles of a good README</h2>
<p>There’s no shortage of projects to contribute to on GitHub, which means that it’s easy for potential contributors to overlook projects that aren’t yet very popular, even if they are great projects. This is a tough pill to swallow for many project maintainers who want to believe that their project will succeed just because it is high quality.</p>
<p>In order to make sure your project doesn’t fade into obscurity, it is critical to communicate the value of your project as soon as possible without requiring a ton of effort from potential contributors. The best way to do this is with a clear and concise README that not only has all the important information but looks good and is easy to read. In this article, we recommend a few key principles for accomplishing this and explain how we’ve applied them with the Appsmith README.</p>
<p>When you read something, you start at the top, so start your README file with the most useful information and then gradually work your way down to the technical details. This prevents readers from becoming overwhelmed before they have enough context to understand the inner workings of your project.</p>
<p>It’s also important to recognize what <em>not</em> to include. README files work best when they are succinct and link out to formal documentation whenever in-depth detail is required. The alternative is to have walls of text all over, which can be very off-putting to readers.</p>
<p>We look at the README as the central hub for all the information that users need to understand a project. It should provide a high-level overview of the project and also show users where to go to find more details, including how it works, links to up-to-date installation options, and finally links to detailed information for contributors.</p>
<p>We also think it is beneficial to <em>show</em> instead of <em>tell</em> wherever possible. We recommend using icons, images, and GIFs to keep it visually engaging and provide visual signposts — helping readers quickly navigate to the details that are important to them.</p>
<p>And if a picture is worth a thousand words, a good GIF is worth a million. We’ve found that it’s a good idea to use GIFs whenever an aspect of your project is particularly easy to use, but hard to describe in words. An example of this with our project is showing off how easy it is to build good-looking, functional applications quickly on Appsmith even though there is a massive amount of complexity behind the scenes that is hidden from users.</p>
<p>GIFs and other visuals can never replace the job of documentation for the nitty-gritty details, but they can absolutely provide that extra “wow” factor when showing off the user interface for your project. And they can make it easy for readers to consume a lot of information about your project quickly with little effort, which is the key to increasing adoption and ultimately contribution for your project.</p>
<h2 id="deconstructing-the-appsmith-readme">Deconstructing the Appsmith README</h2>
<p>Let’s go over the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith">Appsmith README</a> in detail and examine each section, why we made it the way it is, and how it uses the principles outlined above to give readers the information they need as painlessly as possible.</p>
<h3 id="the-heading">The heading</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/5mUmwa6DLMq1zy7hYsK5uk/0daa9413bb7815ceb9c286ad6d82d107/readme1.png" alt="readme1" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/blob/release/README.md">Appsmith README</a> begins with our logo, which helps users visually identify our project. Investing in a good logo for your project is more than worth it — brand recognition is critical, even if your project isn’t for-profit. It’s important for your project to look professional and be memorable, so that it's easy to find and doesn’t get supplanted by a better-branded fork.</p>
<p>Next, we introduce Appsmith with a short, two-sentence overview. Here, we focus only on what Appsmith does and who it is for, not how it works; we’ve found that making this section too long can cause readers to quickly lose interest. By this point, readers should have been able to decide whether the project is relevant to their needs or interests at a high level, before we dive into the technical details.</p>
<p>Next, we include some automated stats to give readers an idea of what’s going on in our community. The number of online users from the Discord community, commit stats, and Docker pulls can give users a sense of how many others are also interested in Appsmith. Seeing that our community is active encourages both users and contributors to join the project.</p>
<p>The final ingredients in our README heading are links to Appsmith’s cloud version signup page, our YouTube channel, and templates (a new feature that developers in particular might find very useful). These are the most common “next steps'' for new arrivals, so we make them highly visible.</p>
<p>That’s a total of three examples showing the activity of the project (Discord users, commit activity, Docker pulls) and three calls to action (Get Started, YouTube, Templates) within this first section. This may seem like a lot, but each one calls out to users with a different purpose, and other readers are not negatively impacted by their presence.</p>
<p>We believe that learning how to use the project is the most important information for a user who is interested in the project. However, different users prefer to learn in different ways: some like to read, some like to watch videos, and some like to reference example templates. This is why we’ve added so many different options here to show users how to get up and running with Appsmith.</p>
<p>With the information provided, they can decide whether they’ve found the project that fulfills their requirements, and find the next step they need to take. By using good-looking visuals and links, we’ve packed a lot of information into a very small space without overwhelming the reader.</p>
<h3 id="how-appsmith-works-for-end-users">How Appsmith works (for end users)</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/508Eyhk80F99VvYq3GD2fY/8ee9c1f6129d0668e765f6289f90bb28/readme2.png" alt="readme2" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Next, we get into how the software works at a high level. We build on the information from the heading, but give more depth so that users can start to form a mental model of the software to understand its most basic concepts. However at this stage, we still hold back on the in-depth details, which we can elaborate on later.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/7p8YMnJGTTjSxv6QsHkmXr/d2134d6178b3e2dcde73dd3c0ce5947d/readme3.gif" alt="readme3" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Now that the reader has context, we expand on the basic process diagram by showing Appsmith in action using GIFs. Here we’re trying to communicate that building an app with Appsmith is as easy as four simple steps. We’re not trying to teach them the inner workings of the platform yet – that is for later. However, if users are interested in more details at this point, they can follow the included links to the documentation on the Appsmith site.</p>
<h3 id="features-for-end-users">Features (for end users)</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/6OhOah9ZpAgu9vjOL9nb3a/82afc43cb85d73ea1bade570791d4640/readme4.png" alt="readme4" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Only now do we get to the information that a lot of READMEs start with: a detailed list of features. At this point, if a reader has read all the way through, they already understand the intentions of the project. Or if a reader is skimming the README, which is more common, it is clear that this is the section geared towards users more familiar with Appsmith who are looking for more details.</p>
<p>Either way, this is the part where we start telling readers more about Appsmith. Text now takes precedence over illustrations so that we can increase the density of information as we explain concepts like our UI builder, pre-built widgets, native database integrations, etc.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/5eEdaQnwdeefFfi8Yvk0Dr/1f9c45230243ef8fdba9d97e71ad7c53/readme5.png" alt="readme5" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Towards the end of the README we start to get into the real technical details. To keep our README skimmable, we do everything we can to avoid walls of text: users should be able to quickly navigate to the major sections, guided by structured, eye-catching formatting.</p>
<p>To assist with this, every feature is bolded with an intuitive icon, with a <span>maximum of one paragraph</span> for the details. We also try to include code snippets wherever it makes sense (for example, when explaining our JavaScript support). And we link out to other resources where it is useful, particularly in sections that include complex topics such as encryption.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-get-set-up-for-end-users">How to get set up (for end users)</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/3tikF45pNyhoOoaDeDfNKB/97927fa4f39adf1da754fb023368342d/readme6.png" alt="readme6" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Users reaching this section either have engaged with the previous content and are interested in the project, or have arrived looking for installation instructions and clicked straight through on the appropriate CTA in the heading.</p>
<p>Our installation instructions are succinct and actionable, showing our deployment options and linking to the relevant documentation. We also have many additional deployment options, but we intentionally limit the ones we show here because we believe in recommending only the best to our users and keeping the README skimmable.</p>
<p>This emphasizes that the Appsmith project is <span>easy to set up</span> and has <span>great community support</span>. And of course, we’re still following all of the principles from before: we rely very lightly on text, link out for more details wherever possible, and make sure to include intuitive visuals that are easy on the eyes.</p>
<h3 id="the-contributor-section">The contributor section</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/3xTXrgS39fRjH5vSvhDppy/1136638efc31808b19a48dbb6987c2d7/readme7.png" alt="readme7" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Here’s where we show off our favorite part of Appsmith: the community! We explain our values and how we make sure we maintain a community that people want to be a part of. We then explain more technical information that would benefit contributors, from how to make contributions to how to set up their development environment.</p>
<p>When creating a community around a project, a Code of Conduct can help shape the communication inside the community. We use our Code of Conduct to clearly explain up front what type of community we’re trying to build, as well as which behaviors aren’t acceptable and how enforcement works. This section helps readers tell whether they share Appsmith’s values and whether they should trust that those values will be maintained.</p>
<p>Assuming that they want to be a part of the Appsmith community after reading the Code of Conduct, the next two components show them how. The contribution guide helps new contributors understand how to make an impact while the setup docs show how easy it is to make a contribution. Both of these are designed to cut down the friction to starting, so that potential contributors can jump right in.</p>
<p>Another addition that has been great for us is the <em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22">good first issues</a></em> section in GitHub. We feel that it’s important to make it as easy as possible to start contributing to Appsmith. We do this by tagging open issues in GitHub with “Good First Issue,” which is a trend that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.blog/2020-01-22-how-we-built-good-first-issues/">GitHub has encouraged</a> over the last few years. This helps new contributors get early wins, improving the project without having to understand the deep, complicated architecture of a project.</p>
<p>All of these components play an integral part in the contributor section. Each document by itself is short and to the point, so we can communicate what kind of community we’re building and how they can be a part of it without massive walls of text.</p>
<p>We then conclude our README on a high note — with a showcase of our top contributors. We want to show all of the developers who are working to make the Appsmith project great and encourage others to join.</p>
<h3 id="an-often-overlooked-part-of-the-readme--the-license">An often overlooked part of the README — the license</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/2JCA9GrRYrrErCDUf2oAxt/d3733a6c785f6398d7a1c01bee99ea58/readme8.png" alt="readme8" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>As a footnote, we close out our README with a link to the project license. The license should be a separate file stored within your repository and linked at the bottom of the README.</p>
<p>Many people overlook the license as the boring legal component, but the license you choose often has a dramatic impact on your project in the open-source world. Your license can affect the type of users and contributors that you attract, and in some cases the types of derivative projects that exist years after you’ve created yours.</p>
<p>For that reason, it is important to pay special attention to your license up front to make sure that you choose the best one for your project in the short- and long-term. There are plenty of guides out there about how to choose the right license for your project, including <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/readme/guides/open-source-licensing">this one from GitHub</a>, so we won’t go too far into the details.</p>
<p>One thing we will say, however, is that we chose the Apache License 2.0 because we wanted to give others the opportunity to build on the work we’ve done (commercially or privately) to drive competition and innovation in the internal tools space.</p>
<h2 id="other-great-readmes">Other great READMEs</h2>
<p>The way we’ve built our README is of course not the only or best way. Each project has different goals and expectations. In order to give some more examples, we also wanted to discuss a couple of different READMEs that we liked across various types of projects.</p>
<h3 id="a-great-package-manager-readme">A great package manager README</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/1uRYBLcpQmNJfiYWntHVBB/32476c78232daff7d9753edb714a4b23/readme9.png" alt="readme9" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/npm/cli">npm</a> is the most popular package manager for JavaScript. Given that this is a package manager, it is harder to explain the project through visuals. This project does a great job of embracing simplicity in the README itself, keeping things incredibly to-the-point and linking out to the more complicated and detailed information.
<img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/XAt3NtLFHb0Op28IJfLyM/19f2f2780208bd86192f8520ad63c463/readme10.png" alt="readme10" loading="lazy"></p>
<h3 id="a-great-framework-readme">A great framework README</h3>
<p>We also really like the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/laravel/laravel">README for Laravel</a>, a popular PHP framework. You can see that they pay attention to a lot of the principles that we focused on in our README, including linking out when more detail is required and avoiding major walls of text.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/WY5cnnjF43tHXmhtrvJee/69bb610152f993b33141ab99b0f18ac4/readme11.png" alt="readme11" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The Laravel README heavily links to the documentation, but, more importantly, it provides links to learning resources for the community. This includes the Laravel Bootcamp to quickly get up and running and Laracasts, a comprehensive video tutorial library. These resources are one of the most appreciated aspects of Laravel according to developers, so it’s important to communicate this to potential users as early as possible (i.e. in the README).</p>
<p>One thing that we did not include in our README, which can be beneficial for emerging open-source projects, is listing how to sponsor the project. Tools like Patreon are a great avenue for developers looking for additional resources to support their project.</p>
<h3 id="a-great-desktop-app-readme">A great desktop app README</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">VSCode</a> is ubiquitous, and it also has a great README.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/59hp2m2qmNdoz1CeQyNUVo/73aed78dd744fe00063b7b80c2856126/readme12.png" alt="readme12" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>This README does a lot of things well, including showing what the IDE looks like during use so that users can immediately get an idea of what the product is. This product category is more established and understood by developers than internal tools builders like Appsmith, so more visuals aren’t necessarily required. It has short, to-the-point descriptions of the product with links to more detailed information.</p>
<h3 id="a-great-non-product-readme">A great non-product README</h3>
<p>We also wanted to take a look at an example of a project that’s focused more on education than a product. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/trekhleb/homemade-machine-learning">Homemade Machine Learning</a> from Trekhleb is one such example. Machine learning can get very complex, so a project like this can benefit <span>heavily</span> from good visuals and links. We find that this README does that very well, as it links out to great learning resources about different machine learning techniques.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/29bpsCiVqL2AGIFxq9HGSh/24f200ed074e52a151539c5ab68ac76b/readme13.png" alt="readme13" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>This project makes great use of visuals to help students develop a mental model for the machine learning field, which is quite vast. There are so many different algorithms to learn, but after remembering them, there is a logical way to classify them, which this diagram shows well.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lpvian6u6i39/6T3t4hCPYrdzrJ7V6jAMq5/10195efbbb9b6956ad0609c42dcb4f09/readme14.png" alt="readme14" loading="lazy"></p>
<h2 id="readmes-can-go-beyond-providing-the-bare-minimum-information-and-give-your-project-an-identity">READMEs can go beyond providing the bare-minimum information and give your project an identity</h2>
<p>We hope this article has spurred some ideas for your own project. In addition to telling users what your project does, your README sets expectations for quality and ease of use, and is a great way to establish your brand.</p>
<p>We’ve put a lot of thought into the content and structure of our README, and have found that with each iteration we’ve been able to engage more visitors as users and community members by prioritizing the content. We’re all on this development journey, and there’s no one right way…</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://discord.gg/rBTTVJp">Let us know</a> if there’s something you think our README could do better, or you have your own to show off!</p></div></div>]]></description>
