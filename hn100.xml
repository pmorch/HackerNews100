<h2><em>New research shows how community engagement is integral in its success.</em></h2>



<p><i><b>by Sarah Goh</b></i></p>



<hr>



<p>With a growing population in the Pacific Northwest, the call for better public transportation heightens. This March, Washington’s State Legislature signed off on a transportation milestone, allocating $150 million to a high-speed connection between Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. </p>



<p>Though this funding could reduce congestion, cut carbon emissions, and better connect these coastal cities, a high-speed rail that travels above 200 miles per hour between major cities has never been done before in the United States. How will Washington get started? How will the State ensure a successful project?</p>



<p>A new <a href="https://mic.comotion.uw.edu/our-work/ultra-high-speed-rail-project/">research report</a> by the University of Washington examines these very questions and identifies key concepts that community members can help with to achieve an efficient high-speed rail. If a rail is built successfully, there will be an extraordinary increase in transportation abilities — saving commuters time while reducing environmental harm. </p>



<p>Professors Jan Whittington and Qing Shen at the UW’s Department of Urban Design and Planning led the research, and with no previous high-speed rail projects in the Northwest, they turned to other states and abroad.</p>



<p>“The purpose of the study was to draw lessons learned from projects, systems, and expertise around the world where high-speed rail has been successful,” Whittington said.</p>



<p>They dedicated six months to both academic and industry research. They interviewed a cadre of transportation experts in France, the Netherlands, Spain, Taiwan, and U.S. cities where high-speed rail is currently developing. </p>



<p>“Oftentimes, [the U.S. is] in a leadership role in developing and growing technologies,” Whittington said. “But here, we’re in a position of needing to learn from people who have had success in their own countries.” </p>



<p>The study allowed interviewees to share their experiences from their own projects. Whittington says that while people are usually unwilling to share their research information, Whittington and Shen’s research allowed experts to talk about their regrets, choices, and early decisions in high-speed rail building. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://mic.comotion.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Keeping-it-on-the-Tracks-High-speed-Rail-Success-and-Lessons-Learned.pdf">final research report</a> spans over 72 pages, with 40 recommendations for transportation departments. However, Whittington emphasized several key points that will be instrumental to the project’s success: For commuters to prioritize rail transportation over air or other non-environmental ways of travel, the high-speed rail must be at its most convenient. To achieve this convenience of speed and efficiency, there cannot be any shortcuts or deviations to the design. Routes are going to be chosen that minimize turns and any design choices that reduce speed. </p>



<p>And Whittington says the designers must also ensure the rail remains dedicated to its high-speed route and that people have the ability to get to the rail through other means of public transportation. “There are going to be a lot of communities you want to serve,” Whittington said, “but you want to find a way to bring those communities to the routes as opposed to bringing the route to the communities.” </p>



<p>Whittington says early planning must engage commuters and the general community. The report itself states, “Have early, systematic, and sustained community engagement, approaching communities to understand their needs instead of selling the idea of high-speed rail.”</p>



<p>Along with community engagement, limiting political sway is important. The study shows that if political representatives convince planners to route through different locations — deviating from the design — cities could end up with an expensive commuter rail system instead of a competitive high-speed rail.</p>



<p>“You have to be very careful about compromises made in design in these early stages,” Whittington said.</p>



<p>Implementing this delicate balance of compromises and early planning is essential for a high-speed rail project, and the UW research has created a place for U.S. transportation departments to start.</p>



<p>“It is our sincere hope that people will be able to see this collection of recommendations as a set of touchstones to build off of as they take the earliest steps in product design and development,” Whittington said.</p>



<p>The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has already begun the early stages of building a high-speed rail in the Cascadia region with help from the UW study. They are looking to secure more funding and focus on the meticulousness of the early design process. Especially in collaboration with Oregon and British Columbia, a project like this is formidable and will take years.</p>



<p>“We don’t want to short-circuit the work we need to do with communities,” said Ron Pate, WSDOT’s director for Rail, Freight and Ports. “Our goal is to make sure we work with communities when moving it forward.” </p>

<p><strong>July 20, 2023:</strong> On the evening of July 19th, SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. Sky watchers from southern California to Arizona witnessed a <a href="https://spaceweathergallery2.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=197985">magnificent exhaust plume</a>. At the San Francisco Volcanic Field north of Flagstaff, photographer Jeremy Perez saw something extra:</p>



<figure><a href="https://spaceweathergallery2.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=198036"><img src="https://spaceweather.com/images2023/21jul23/redglow_strip2.jpg" alt=""></a></figure>



<p>“After the rocket passed overhead, a red fluorescent glow expanded southward and crossed over the Milky Way,” says Perez. “It was visible for almost 20 minutes.”</p>



<p>The red glow is a sign that the rocket punched a hole in the ionosphere–something SpaceX and others have been doing for years. One famous example occured on August 25, 2017, when a Falcon 9 rocket carrying Taiwan’s FORMOSAT-5 satellite <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2017SW001738">created a hole</a> four times bigger than the state of California. On June 19, 2022, another Falcon 9 <a href="https://spaceweather.com/archive.php?day=21&amp;month=06&amp;year=2022&amp;view=view">punched a hole</a> over the east coast of the USA, sparking a display of red lights from New York to the Carolinas that many observers mistook for aurora borealis.</p>



<p>“This is a <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008SW000406">well studied phenomenon</a> when rockets are burning their engines 200 to 300 km above Earth’s surface,” explains space physicist Jeff Baumgardner of Boston University. “The red glow appears when exhaust gasses from the rocket’s 2nd stage cause the ionosphere to recombine quickly.”</p>



<p>Rocket engines spray water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) into the ionosphere, quenching local ionization by as much as 70%. A complicated series of charge exchange reactions between oxygen ions (O<sup>+</sup>) and molecules from the rocket exhaust produce photons at a wavelength of 6300 Å–the same color as red auroras.</p>



<p>This movie from David Blanchard outside Flagstaff shows how the red glow developed as the silvery rocket exhaust faded into the ionosphere:</p>



<figure><a href="https://spaceweathergallery2.com/indiv_upload.php?upload_id=198052"><img src="https://spaceweather.com/images2023/21jul23/db_anim_strip.gif" alt=""></a></figure>



<p>“I watched the show from Upper Lake Mary in the Coconino National Forest,” says Blanchard. “The exhaust plume was spectacular.”</p>



<p>Baumgardner reviewed SpaceX’s video footage from the July 19th launch. “It shows the second stage engine burning at 286 km near the ionosphere’s F-region peak for that time of day. So, it is quite possible that an ionospheric ‘hole’ was made,” he says.</p>



<p>Once rare, ionospheric “punch holes” are increasingly common with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00048-7">record numbers of rocket launches</a> led by SpaceX sending Starlink satellites to low-Earth orbit. Ham radio operators may notice them when shortwave signals fail to skip over the horizon, shooting through holes instead of bouncing back to Earth. Sudden GPS errors can also result from the anomalies. These effects may be troublesome, but they are shortlived; re-ionization occurs as soon as the sun comes up again.</p>

              <p>Posting for the whole Steering Council, on the subject of <a href="https://discuss.python.org/u/colesbury">@colesbury</a>’s <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/">PEP 703 (Making the Global Interpreter Lock Optional in CPython)</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you, everyone, for responding to the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/poll-feedback-to-the-sc-on-making-cpython-free-threaded-and-pep-703/28540">poll on the no-GIL proposal</a>. It’s clear that the overall sentiment is positive, both for the general idea and for PEP 703 specifically. The Steering Council is also largely positive on both. We intend to accept PEP 703, although we’re still working on the acceptance details.</p>
<p>As we’ve done a few times in the past, we want to communicate our intent to accept the PEP along with where our current thinking is on the details around acceptance.</p>
<p>Our base assumptions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long-term (probably 5+ years), the no-GIL build should be the only build. We do not want to create a permanent split between with-GIL and no-GIL builds (and extension modules).</li>
<li>We want to be very careful with backward compatibility. We do not want another Python 3 situation, so any changes in third-party code needed to accommodate no-GIL builds should just work in with-GIL builds (although backward compatibility with older Python versions will still need to be addressed). This is not Python 4. We are still considering the requirements we want to place on ABI compatibility and other details for the two builds and the effect on backward compatibility.</li>
<li>Before we commit to switching entirely to the no-GIL build, we need to see community support for it. We can’t just flip the default and expect the community to figure out what work they need to do to support it. We, the core devs, need to gain experience with the new build mode and all it entails. We will probably need to figure out new C APIs and Python APIs as we sort out thread safety in existing code. We also need to bring along the rest of the Python community as we gain those insights and make sure the changes we want to make, and the changes we want them to make, are palatable.</li>
<li>We want to be able to change our mind if it turns out, any time before we make no-GIL the default, that it’s just going to be too disruptive for too little gain. Such a decision could mean rolling back all of the work, so until we’re certain we want to make no-GIL the default, code specific to no-GIL should be somewhat identifiable.</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, what we currently see as the way forward is three stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short term, we add the no-GIL build as an experimental build mode, presumably in 3.13 (if it slips to 3.14, that is not a problem). We want the build mode to be experimental to make it clear that while the core devs support that build mode, we can’t expect the community to support it outright. We need time to figure out what we need to do, at the very least in terms of API design and packaging and distribution, to enable the community to support it. We also want to discourage distributors from shipping the experimental no-GIL build as a default interpreter.</li>
<li>Mid-term, after we have confidence that there is enough community support to make production use of no-GIL viable, we make the no-GIL build supported but not the default (yet), and set a target date/Python version for making it the default. The timing is going to depend a lot on, for example, how backward compatible the API changes end up being (e.g., what to do about the stable ABI), and how much work the community thinks they still need to do. We expect this to take at least a year or two, possibly more. Once we declare it supported we expect some distributors may start shipping no-GIL by default, although it will probably vary greatly by how many other Python packages support no-GIL at that point.</li>
<li>Long-term, we want no-GIL to be the default, and to remove any vestiges of the GIL (without unnecessarily breaking backward compatibility). We don’t want to wait too long with this, because having two common build modes may be a heavy burden on the community (as, for example, it can double test resources and debugging scenarios), but we can’t rush it either. We think it may take as much as five years to get to this stage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the process we (the core devs, not just the SC) will need to re-evaluate the progress and the suggested timelines. We don’t want this to turn into another ten year backward compatibility struggle, and we want to be able to call off PEP 703 and find another solution if it looks to become problematic, and so we need to regularly check that the continued work is worth it.</p>
<p>We hope that this gives some clarity into the future of the PEP while we work on the exact acceptance details. The SC will work to finalise the acceptance over the coming weeks.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p><span>The U.K. Parliament is pushing ahead with a sprawling internet regulation bill that will, among other things, undermine the privacy of people around the world. The </span><a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3137"><span>Online Safety Bill</span></a><span>, now </span>at the final<span> stage before passage in the House of Lords, gives the British government the ability to force backdoors into messaging services, which will destroy end-to-end encryption. No amendments have been accepted that would mitigate the bill’s most dangerous elements.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://eff.org/osb">TAKE ACTION</a></p>
<p><a href="https://eff.org/osb">TELL&nbsp;the U.K. Parliament: Don't Break Encryption</a></p>
<p>If it passes, the Online Safety Bill will be a huge step backwards for global privacy, and democracy itself. Requiring government-approved software in peoples’ messaging services is an awful precedent. If the Online Safety Bill becomes British law, the damage it causes won’t stop at the borders of the U.K.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The sprawling bill, which originated in a </span><a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8743/"><span>white paper</span></a><span> on “online harms” that’s now more than four years old, would be </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23708180/united-kingdom-online-safety-bill-explainer-legal-pornography-age-checks"><span>the most wide-ranging internet regulation ever passed</span></a><span>. At EFF, we’ve been </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/08/uks-online-safety-bill-attacks-free-speech-and-encryption"><span>clearly speaking about its disastrous effects</span></a><span> for more than a year now.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It would require content filtering, as well as age checks to access erotic content. The bill also requires detailed reports about online activity to be sent to the government. Here, we’re discussing just one fatally flawed aspect of OSB—how it will break encryption.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong><span>An Obvious Threat To Human Rights</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>It’s a basic human right to have a private conversation. To have those rights realized in the digital world, the best technology we have is end-to-end encryption. And it’s utterly incompatible with the government-approved message-scanning technology required in the Online Safety Bill.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is because of something that EFF </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/encryption-balance-2015-review"><span>has been saying for years</span></a><span>—there is no backdoor to encryption that only gets used by the “good guys.” Undermining encryption, whether by banning it, pressuring companies away from it, or requiring </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption"><span>client side scanning</span></a><span>, will be a boon to bad actors and authoritarian states.</span></p>
<p><span>The U.K. government wants to grant itself the right to scan every message online for content related to child abuse or terrorism—and says it will still, somehow, magically, protect peoples’ privacy. That’s simply impossible. </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/11/experts-condemn-uk-online-safety-bill-harmful-privacy-and-encryption"><span>U.K. civil society groups</span></a><span> have condemned the bill, as have technical experts and </span><a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/2022/11/70-organizations-cyber-security-experts-and-elected-officials-sign-open-letter-expressing-dangers-of-the-uks-online-safety-bill/"><span>human rights groups around the world</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The companies that provide encrypted messaging—such as WhatsApp, Signal, and the UK-based Element—have also explained the bill’s danger. In an </span><a href="https://element.io/blog/the-online-safety-bill-an-attack-on-encryption/"><span>open letter published in April</span></a><span>, they explained that OSB “could break end-to-end encryption, opening the door to routine, general and indiscriminate surveillance of personal messages of friends, family members, employees, executives, journalists, human rights activists and even politicians themselves.” Apple </span><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/29/apple_online_safety_bill_opposition/"><span>joined</span></a><span> this group in June, stating publicly that the bill threatens encryption and “could put U.K. citizens at greater risk.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong><span>U.K. Government Says: Nerd Harder</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>In response to this outpouring of resistance, the U.K. government’s response has been to wave its hands and deny reality.</span> <span>In a response letter to the House of Lords seen by EFF, the U.K.’s Minister for Culture, Media and Sport simply re-hashes an imaginary world in which messages can be scanned while user privacy is maintained. “We have seen companies develop such solutions for platforms with end-to-end encryption before,” the letter states, a reference to <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption">client-side scanning</a>. “Ofcom should be able to require” the use of such technologies, and where “off-the-shelf solutions” are not available, “it is right that the Government has led the way in exploring these technologies.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The letter refers to the Safety Tech Challenge Fund, a program in which the U.K. gave small grants to companies to develop software that would allegedly protect user privacy while scanning files. But of course, they couldn’t square the circle. The grant winners’ </span><a href="https://express.adobe.com/page/vxBuQnoqvGhYE/"><span>descriptions of their own prototypes</span></a><span> clearly describe different forms of client-side scanning, in which user files are scoped out with AI before they’re allowed to be sent in an encrypted channel.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Minister completes his response on encryption by writing:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>We expect the industry to use its extensive expertise and resources to innovate and build robust solutions for individual platforms/services that ensure both privacy and child safety by preventing child abuse content from being freely shared on public and private channels.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>This is just repeating a fallacy that we’ve heard for years: that if tech companies can’t create a backdoor that magically defends users, they must simply “nerd harder.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span></span><span>British Lawmakers Still Can And Should Protect Our Privacy</span></h3>
<p><span> U.K. lawmakers still have a chance to stop their nation from taking this shameful leap forward towards mass surveillance. </span>End-to-end encryption was not fully considered and voted on during either committee or report stage in the House of Lords. The Lords can still add a simple amendment that would protect private messaging, and specify that end-to-end encryption won’t be weakened or removed.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <span>EFF joined U.K. civil society groups and sent </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2023/07/14/all_peers_letter_-_online_safety_bill_lords_committee_stage.pdf"><span>a briefing explaining our position</span></a><span> to the House of Lords. The briefing explains the encryption-related problems with the current bill, and proposes the adoption of an amendment that will protect end-to-end encryption. If such an amendment is not adopted, those who pay the price will be “human rights defenders and journalists who rely on private messaging to do their jobs in hostile environments; and … those who depend on privacy to be able to express themselves freely, like LGBTQ+ people.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It’s a remarkable failure that the House of Lords has not even taken up a serious debate over protecting encryption and privacy, despite ample time to review every every section of the bill.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://eff.org/osb">TAKE ACTION</a></p>
<p><a href="https://eff.org/osb">TELL the U.K. Parliament:&nbsp;PROTECT Encryption</a>—And our privacy</p>
<p><span>Finally, Parliament should reject this bill because universal scanning and surveillance is abhorrent to their own constituents. It is not what the British people want. </span><a href="https://element.io/blog/end-to-end-encryption-the-will-of-the-british-people/"><span>A recent survey of U.K. citizens</span></a><span> showed that 83% wanted the highest level of security and privacy available on messaging apps like Signal, WhatsApp, and Element.&nbsp;</span></p>

When, years ago, I began working for tech companies in San Francisco, I noticed that my co-workers were always scrolling through a beige, text-only Web site that resembled a nineteen-nineties Internet forum. They were reading Hacker News—a link aggregator and message board that is something of a Silicon Valley institution. Technologists in Silicon Valley assume familiarity with Hacker News, just as New Yorkers do with the New York <em>Post</em> and the New York <em>Times</em>. For some, it’s the first Web site they pull up in the morning; it captures the mix of technical obsession, business ambition, and aspirational curiosity that’s typical of the Valley. On any given day, its top links might include a Medium post about <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/brief-thoughts-on-getting-hired-as-a-senior-coder-94f38998bb08">technical hiring</a>; a 1997 article from <em>Outside</em> magazine about <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2152131/freezing-death?page=all">freezing to death</a>; an open-source <a data-offer-url="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20571739" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20571739&quot;}" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20571739" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">virtual private network</a> hosted on GitHub; an <a href="http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf">academic paper</a>, from 2006, about compiler construction; an <a data-offer-url="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20297446" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20297446&quot;}" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20297446" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> from Facebook’s corporate communications team; a personal blog post about Linux kernels, and another about <a data-offer-url="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/i-sell-onions-on-the-internet/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.deepsouthventures.com/i-sell-onions-on-the-internet/&quot;}" href="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/i-sell-onions-on-the-internet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">selling Vidalia onions</a> on the Internet. Nearly all the software engineers I know check it religiously. Not one of them has a neutral opinion about it.</p><p>Like many of the software products that have shaped the Valley, Hacker News began as a side project. In 2007, the venture capitalist Paul Graham, who was then the president of the startup accelerator Y Combinator—an early investor in Dropbox, Stripe, Reddit, Twitch, and other companies—built the site as a way to experiment with Arc, a new programming language that he was co-authoring. Originally, Graham named the site Startup News. He hoped that it would serve as a new home for the startup founders and “would-be founders” who had once gathered on Reddit, before that site grew too popular to feel like a community. Among other benefits, he imagined that Startup News might help him find worthy entrepreneurs. (“There are a number of Reddit users that I know only by their usernames, but I know must be smart from the things they’ve written,” he explained, in his launch announcement. “We’re counting on the same phenomenon to help us decide who to fund.”) Within a few months, though, Graham found that startup-centric conversation had its limits. He renamed the site Hacker News, and expanded its focus to include “anything that good hackers would find interesting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. anything that gratifies one’s intellectual curiosity.” (Hacker News is still owned by Y Combinator.)</p><p>The site was intentionally simple. It offered a dynamic list of links, submitted by users, each of which could be expanded into its own unique comment thread. Readers could upvote or downvote links and comments, and the top thirty links would be featured on the front page. The guidelines specified that most non-tech-related news—political news, in particular—was off topic. Users discussed the merits of relational databases, the complexities of co-founder relationships, and the pros and cons of dropping out of college. They exchanged screenshots of their work environments and compared their results on a “nerd quiz” that asked them to name a programming language for every letter of the alphabet. They commented on Graham’s essays about programming and entrepreneurship—“Like chess or painting or writing novels,” he <a data-offer-url="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=811433" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=811433&quot;}" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=811433" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">wrote</a>, “making money is a very specialized skill”—and shared advice on how to get into Y Combinator.</p><p>At first, the site attracted about sixteen hundred daily visitors, and Graham moderated and maintained it himself. Today, around five million people read Hacker News each month, and it’s grown more difficult to moderate. The technical discussions remain varied and can be insightful. But social, cultural, and political conversations, which, despite the guidelines, have proliferated, tend to devolve. A recent comment thread about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/business/youtube-remove-extremist-videos.html">a <em>Times</em> article</a>, “YouTube to Remove Thousands of Videos Pushing Extreme Views,” yielded a response likening journalism and propaganda; a muddled juxtaposition of pornography and Holocaust denial; a vague side conversation about the average I.Q. of Hacker News commenters; and confused analogies between white supremacists and Black Lives Matter activists. In April, when <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47891902">a story</a> about Katie Bouman, an M.I.T. researcher who helped develop a technology that captured the first photo of a black hole, rose to the front page, users combed through her code on GitHub in an effort to undermine the weight of her contributions.</p><p>The site’s now characteristic tone of performative erudition—hyperrational, dispassionate, contrarian, authoritative—often masks a deeper recklessness. Ill-advised citations proliferate; thought experiments abound; humane arguments are dismissed as emotional or irrational. Logic, applied narrowly, is used to justify broad moral positions. The most admired arguments are made with data, but the origins, veracity, and malleability of those data tend to be ancillary concerns. The message-board intellectualism that might once have impressed V.C. observers like Graham has developed into an intellectual style all its own. Hacker News readers who visit the site to learn how engineers and entrepreneurs talk, and what they talk about, can find themselves immersed in conversations that resemble the output of duelling Markov bots trained on libertarian economics blogs, “The Tim Ferriss Show,” and the work of Yuval Noah Harari.</p><p>People have been trying to outsmart one another on Internet forums for as long as there have been Internet forums. Still, Hacker News has an unusually wide influence. Landing a blog post or personal project on the front page is a badge of honor for many technologists, and the site has become a regional export: ninety per cent of its traffic comes from outside the Bay Area, and a third of its users are in Europe. The site is now a portal to tech culture for millions of people. At the same time, it has become a punch line and a punching bag for tech workers and engineers who see it as a locus of hubris, myopia, and exclusivity. A word that comes up frequently among its critics is “toxic.”</p><p>Picturing the moderators responsible for steering conversation on Hacker News, I imagined a team of men who proudly self-identify as neoliberals and are active in the effective-altruism movement. (I assumed they’d be white men; it never occurred to me that women, or people of color, could be behind the site.) Meeting them, I feared, would be like participating in a live-action comment thread about the merits of Amazon Web Services or whether women should be referred to as “females.” “Debate us!” I imagined them saying, in unison, from their Aeron chairs.</p><p>The site’s real-life moderators are Daniel Gackle and Scott Bell, two wildly polite old friends. On Facebook and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-fight-for-the-future-of-youtube">YouTube</a>, moderation is often done reactively and anonymously, by teams of overworked contractors; on <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/19/reddit-and-the-struggle-to-detoxify-the-internet">Reddit</a>, teams of employees purge whole user communities like surgeons removing tumors. Gackle and Bell, by contrast, practice a personal, focussed, and slow approach to moderation, which they see as a conversational act. They treat their community like an encounter group or Esalen workshop; often, they correspond with individual Hacker News readers over e-mail, coaching and encouraging them in long, heartfelt exchanges.</p><p>Gackle and Bell met in Calgary, in the early two-thousands, at a local user group for the rarefied programming language Lisp. (Arc, the language in which Hacker News is written, is a descendant of it.) Gackle, whose name is pronounced “Gack-lee” and who declined to share his age, is a muscular, bald, and loquacious father of two and a devoted fan of the Canadian sketch-comedy show “The Kids in the Hall.” Bell, who is thirty-four, is willowy and soft-spoken, with closely buzzed hair and tattoos that peek out from beneath his cardigans. The two often finish each other’s sentences; they sometimes dress, accidentally, in matching outfits. (Bell attributes this to office-wide “sartorial mimetics.”) Online and in person, Gackle is chatty, Bell reserved. They are reluctant, protective spokespeople. Pressed to describe Hacker News, they do so by means of extravagant, sometimes tender metaphors: the site is a “social ecosystem,” a “hall of mirrors,” a “public park or garden,” a “fractal tree.”</p><p>“Hacker News is quite a counterintuitive thing,” Gackle said, in a conference room in Y Combinator’s San Francisco office. “At least how we see it, from our perspective, it’s often pretty different from how it appears from the outside.”</p><p>“It doesn’t grab you right away, just on the surface,” Bell said, his hands cradling a mug of tea. “It takes a little bit to get a feel for what it is.”</p><p>“The Hacker News front page is a product of a certain tension,” Gackle said. “There’s multiple tug-of-wars going on over the types of stories people would like to see. The one consensus is that it’s not as good as it used to be. I feel bad when people say that, but I also realize that, in a way, it indicates a certain attachment.”</p><p>“There are some people who don’t realize Hacker News is moderated at all,” Bell continued. “There are some people with whom we’ve been e-mailing for four or five years. My guess is that the distribution is somewhat mostly in the middle. But I don’t know.” He turned to Gackle, looking grave. “I don’t have a strong sense of that. Do you, Dan?”</p><p>“I don’t think I can answer it,” Gackle said, intently. “One of the things I’ve learned is that almost all of the generalizations are wrong. And I’ve learned this because people love to post generalizations about Hacker News to Hacker News.”</p><p>In an Emacs file, Gackle collects a list of contradictory statements that people have used to describe Hacker News. (“SJW cesspool”; “<a data-offer-url="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14205262" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14205262&quot;}" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14205262" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a haven</a> for alt-right and libertarian people”; “If you don’t support neoliberal fantasies, your comments <a data-offer-url="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14529468" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14529468&quot;}" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14529468" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">probably aren’t welcome here</a>”; “The only thing is left is to change Hacker News icon <a data-offer-url="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18189135" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18189135&quot;}" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18189135" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">to Che Guevara emblem</a>.”) He and Bell assert their own opinions in subtle ways. Recently, they made some small changes to the Hacker News guidelines, which have always hewed closely to those that Graham drafted in 2007. To one about throwaway accounts—acceptable for sensitive information but discouraged as a regular practice—they added the reminder “HN is a community.” In another—“Comments should get more civil and substantive, not less, as a topic becomes more divisive”—they changed the phrase “civil and substantive” to “thoughtful and substantive.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Recently, an essay in the <em>New Atlantis</em> titled “<a data-offer-url="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/do-elephants-have-souls" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/do-elephants-have-souls&quot;}" href="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/do-elephants-have-souls" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Do Elephants Have Souls?</a>,” from 2013, hit the front page. The piece generated immediate resistance. Commenters responded literally to the question posed in the title and bickered about the word “soul.” Conversation spiralled, with users making arguments about Cartesian metaphysics and quoting Socrates. “Why is such an unscientific question so high on HN?” one commenter asked. “Or to rephrase, if we don’t know what a soul is, how can we hope to answer it WRT elephants? So how and why should a reasoning person rate an article like this?”</p><p>“The article itself is just this wonderful exploration into the literature around elephants,” Gackle told me. “I don’t know how anybody could read that article and not just go, like, ‘Wow’—I mean, at least if you’re interested in elephants in any way.” Posting under his Hacker News username, dang, he staged a moderate intervention. “All: This article is not about souls,” he wrote. “It’s about elephants, humans, how we relate to elephants, how they relate to us, how humans relate to non-humans.” He continued:</p><blockquote><p>It is erudite and beautiful. It uses the astonishing literature about elephants to ask about ourselves, them, and the world. “Soul” here is a trope for aspects of humanness that we may or may not have in common. Usually, we just edit titles that are triggering people. If I were to do that here, I might rename it “Elephants and Anthropomorphism.” But when an article is this rich, moving, even profound, taking away its title would maim it. It bears a much better discussion than the thread has given it so far, so please let’s talk about what’s interesting and stay off the metaphysics.</p></blockquote><p>One reader, with the username solipsism, <a data-offer-url="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19836914" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19836914&quot;}" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19836914" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">objected to Gackle’s claims</a> about what was and wasn’t interesting. “Most would agree there’s a point at which moderation goes too far,” solipsism wrote. “I can’t tell if you’re making an appeal as a person, or making a decree as a moderator. I read the article, and it’s absolutely full of metaphysics.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. These metaphysical topics interest me, and apparently they interested the writer, even if they don’t interest you.”</p><p>Gackle conceded that his dismissal was unfair. He removed the reference to metaphysics from his comment. “The point is simply that the article deserves a better discussion,” he wrote, with breezy, cheerful weariness. “I’m making an appeal as a moderator person.”</p><p>Bell and Gackle didn’t set out to become forum moderators. At Stanford, Gackle wrote a master’s thesis on Pyotr Vyazemsky and Nikolay Karamzin, two nineteenth-century Russian poets; Bell studied network engineering, at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, after a stint performing in punk, hardcore, and metalcore bands. When they met, in the Lisp user group, they both were working as coders and unfulfilled by their office jobs. Gackle later told me that he sees frustration at work as part of the DNA of Hacker News. “The instinct that there simply has to be a better way to build systems, and the yearning to connect with it,” he said. “If you can’t do that at your job, and few can, then you can at least dream and read and argue about it on the Internet. Hacker News is the inverse image of many people’s jobs, overlaid on top of each other—an escape valve for frustrated idealists.”</p><p>Bell had discovered Lisp while staving off boredom in a college computer-science course (he read technical documentation to pass the time); Gackle learned about it as a child, in <em>Byte</em> magazine. “When I program in other languages, even ones I know well,” he said, “I feel like I’ve flown to Jupiter. Gravity is so strong that every step is a struggle. In Lisp, you can dance.” In the user group, they found they had overlapping intellectual interests and complementary programming skills. Gackle worked at what he calls “a sort of product factory” where he built “little Potemkin products that would mostly get killed.” He had come to feel that he was helping to build software for users who didn’t need it; what they needed, he believed, was a customizable spreadsheet that improved on Microsoft Excel. (“Excel was these users’ Garden of Eden, where they could make their own spreadsheets and play with them in endless bliss, but they were cast out of Eden because their problems were too complex,” he told me.) In 2008, he and Bell formed a startup, Skysheet, with the mission of building a Web-based spreadsheet. A few months later, they were accepted into Y Combinator, which they’d learned about through Graham’s essays. They moved to Silicon Valley at the height of the recession.</p><p>Skysheet’s Y Combinator “class” of sixteen companies included Heyzap, a mobile-ad network that was acquired in 2015, for forty-five million dollars, and a struggling travel startup that would go on to become Airbnb. At the end of the program, the other founders in the group voted Skysheet the third most likely to succeed. But, after Y Combinator, Bell and Gackle found it difficult to fund-raise. It was the spring of 2009, and the market was bottoming out. “We learned that fund-raising means presenting yourself as impressive, desirable, and just about to be huge, even if the person you’re talking to is so mistaken as not to invest,” Gackle recalled. (Hearing this, I thought of the rhetorical style so widely deployed on Hacker News.) “Perhaps it’s partly the Canadianness, but this does not come naturally to either Scott or me.” Eventually, they raised a hundred and eighty thousand dollars and moved back to Canada to build the software. Some of the technical challenges were more complex than they’d anticipated; there was no existing literature to guide them. As delays mounted, Gackle had panic attacks nightly.</p><p>By 2012, Skysheet had yet to launch a public product and had run out of money. Bell made the painful decision to leave the company, taking a job with a software consultancy. Gackle forged ahead. “My feeling was I would rather fail at this than succeed at anything else,” he told me. Later that year, Graham reached out with an invitation to work on Hacker News, which, at that point, had nearly two million users. “I said no, because I knew it would mean no longer being able to think about spreadsheet software all day,” Gackle said.</p><p>That August, Gackle went for a hike in the Rockies. He slipped and fell on a mountainside, tumbling downhill, bouncing off the rocks. Somehow, he rolled to a stop against a boulder. Shaken, he hiked home. “It jolted me deeply, and after that I admitted to myself that I also was out of money and needed a job,” Gackle recalled. He reached out to Graham: “I told him yes, but with a feeling of unfinished business about this technical problem, which I still carry.” He became a behind-the-scenes moderator of Hacker News. A couple of years later, he hired Bell. In a way, they were perfectly prepared. Having briefly lived the dream and failed, they would now immerse themselves in a culture in which winning—an argument, a market—is a top priority.</p><p>Gackle and Bell are the only Y Combinator employees working on the site. In addition to moderating it, they maintain its technical infrastructure. (When I mentioned, at a party, that I was writing about Hacker News, an entrepreneur blurted, “It’s the fastest Web site I use!”) They post in comment threads, defending commenters who encounter combative or aggressive behavior and content that’s been downvoted, flagged, or misunderstood; they sometimes spend hours a day e-mailing with individual users, helping them use Hacker News more conscientiously and effectively. (“Present this not primarily as a moral appeal&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but as an intellectual one,” Gackle wrote, over e-mail, to a user who was soliciting help for a man who had recently been exonerated after eleven years in prison for a crime he did not commit. “You should frame it as a puzzle or an engineering problem. That will engage the community’s curiosity, which is your only hope for getting a real discussion going.”)</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“The only way to learn it is to get it wrong, and, when you get it wrong, you get flamed,” Gackle said, in the conference room. “And you get flamed so hard that it’s like being stung by a swarm of bees. It’s sort of like operant conditioning. If you put yourself in that position, where you’re getting stung on a daily basis, you’re soon going to start learning what makes the bees less likely.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” he paused. “Or, actually, I like bees. I would say ‘wasps’—what makes the wasps less likely to bite you.”</p><p>“The other way to learn is to let someone else get stung first,” Bell said, quietly.</p><p>In December, 2016—about a month after Donald Trump’s election—<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/11/30/researchers-may-have-found-many-of-chinas-30-million-missing-girls/?utm_term=.6a8ddb01a670">an article</a> from the Washington <em>Post</em> hit Hacker News’ front page. The article covered a study of China’s “one child” policy, conducted by researchers at the University of Kansas and Shaanxi Normal University, that claimed that female children who were long believed to have been aborted or killed in infancy were simply not registered with the government at birth. The ensuing conversation rapidly devolved into arguments over whether or not institutional barriers exist; whether it was acceptable for users to correct the grammar of commenters whose first language was not English; whether sublimated testosterone was responsible for jihad and sexual assaults in Germany; the merits of Jill Stein; and voter fraud.</p><p>“Every single time poll restrictions have been proposed, it’s been for racist causes,” one user wrote, in response to a commenter with the username rokosbasilisk, who was advocating for a voter-identification system. “You yourself may not be a hooded member of the KKK, but you are pushing for the same things, and that’s all that matters.”</p><p>“so india wanted to voter id to prevent black people from voting?” rokosbasilisk responded. “seriously the race stuff just doesnt matter if we follow the indian model.”</p><p>“I have more faith in black people than you i guess, and think they are perfectly capable of getting an id,” a third user wrote.</p><p>“This has taken us into sociopolitical hell,” Bell posted, “and Hacker News isn’t that kind of site.” He “detached” some of the more inflammatory conversations from the main thread, hiding them from view.</p><p>That discussion, and also several others that emerged in the weeks after the election, prompted Gackle and Bell to experiment with and idea they called Political Detox Week. For seven days, political stories and threads would be considered off-topic and flagged by the moderators. The experiment was met with both relief and derision. “Political discourse is antithetical to rational, intelligent discussion,” one user wrote, in a comment that was upvoted to the top of the thread about the detox week. “Technological topics are always interesting to me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I love that there’s this corner of the Internet where I can participate in a reasoned, interesting technical community. Please don’t ruin it with politics, especially the polarizing American variant.”</p><p>Down the page, another user expressed disdain for the experiment. “The idea that we can carve out a space that exists outside of politics and ideology is delusional,” the user wrote. “Squelching political discussion won’t cause us all to transcend ideology, it’ll just make it impossible to discuss or critique a dominant ideology whenever one shows up in someone’s unstated assumptions.”</p><p>“Of course it’s delusional,” Gackle replied. “And still we have to moderate this site.” Three days later, he <a data-offer-url="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13131251" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13131251&quot;}" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13131251" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> that Political Detox Week would be coming to an end. They’d learned, among other things, that “it’s impossible to define ‘politics’ with any consensus because that question is itself highly political.”</p><p>The most ideologically motivated or extreme posts and comments on Hacker News—an interview piece from Quillette titled “Understanding Victimhood Culture”; a link to a video of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-silicon-valleys-workplace-culture-produced-james-damores-google-memo">James Damore</a> and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/05/jordan-petersons-gospel-of-masculinity">Jordan Peterson</a> in conversation; one user telling another that all Jewish people should <a data-offer-url="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13056816" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13056816&quot;}" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13056816" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">relocate</a> to Israel—tend to get flagged by the community or the site’s anti-abuse systems, many of which Bell and Gackle have written themselves. (Flagged posts are removed from view, though they remain searchable by URL; flagged comments are rendered in pale gray text, and only visible to logged-in users who have chosen to see “dead” comments.) Still, as an occasional reader, I have noticed certain trends. When stories that focus on structural barriers faced by women in the workplace, or on diversity in tech, or on race or masculinity—stories, admittedly, that are more intriguing to me, a person interested in the humanities, than stories on technical topics—hit the front page, users often flag them, presumably for being off topic, so fast that hardly any comments accrue. When I shared these impressions with Gackle and Bell, they looked distressed. I asked if these were problems that they felt they could, or should, be controlling or trying to change on the site.</p><p>“From our perspective, the big surprise is how little control we actually have. We have to play our cards very carefully and very wisely, or even that control will sort of evaporate,” Gackle said. “There’s often a strong wish to solve these contentious problems by changing the software, and, to the extent that we’ve tried things like that, we haven’t found it to work. What does seem to work better is personal interaction, over and over and over again, with individual users. That, case by case by case, seems to move the needle. But it’s very slow.”</p><p>“If we’re trying to change something deep, the ingredient is time,” Bell said. “Patience allows us to be ambitious—to imagine people being more kind to each other, for example. It sounds kind of crazy.”</p><p>For Gackle and Bell, moderating Hacker News has presented an opportunity for self-work. Together, they have read up on nonviolent communication, sociology, and psychotherapy. (Bell found Carl Rogers’s “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Person-Therapists-View-Psychotherapy/dp/039575531X" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Person-Therapists-View-Psychotherapy/dp/039575531X&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Person-Therapists-View-Psychotherapy/dp/039575531X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">On Becoming a Person</a>”—a 1961 book about personal growth that became a bible of the humanistic-psychology movement—particularly valuable.) Gackle is drawn to healing workshops; Bell, to Indian philosophy. They seem, at times, to be applying old, humanist techniques to a culture obsessed with the future.</p><p>“Something that’s deeply interesting, I think, to both of us,” Gackle said, “is the way in which one can arrive at a nonviolent reaction to somebody by having greater awareness of the—” He paused. “I’ll say violence in oneself. By which I mean the kind of agitation and activation that is causing people, including ourselves, to react in a kind of fight-or-flight way that leads to misunderstanding, conflict, and, ultimately, Internet flame wars. This seemingly trivial stuff, about people getting mad at other people on the Internet, is actually tied to this much deeper and more fascinating process of what goes on between people and what goes on in oneself.”</p><p>“It’s another opportunity for us to influence the system, by exemplifying the kind of patterns of discussion that we would like to see,” Bell said. “We just want to constantly set an example.”</p><p>In April, the <em>Times</em> ran <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/lens/sarah-lewis-racial-bias-photography.html">an essay</a> by Sarah Lewis, a Harvard professor, titled “The Racial Bias Built Into Photography.” The essay was a historical inquiry, inspecting lens development and film-emulsion technology, and was written in the first person. When it landed on Hacker News, users immediately rushed to flag it as off topic. Gackle changed the title to “Photography and racial bias,” and turned off flagging, which restored the essay to its original position on the front page.</p><p>“I take issue with this article simply because photography isn’t a technology at all,” one user commented. “It is an art that uses technology. There are millions of pictures of people of all races that look perfectly fine. I take issue with stirring up people for no reason. If a maker of paints in the 1800s owned slaves does that mean that painting (then, now, in the future) is racist? How ridiculous can we get?” Another user <a data-offer-url="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19755097" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19755097&quot;}" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19755097" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> the opening lines of Rudyard Kipling’s poem “The White Man’s Burden.” A third wrote, “The people who invented the tech (US/Europe/Japan) optimised it for consumers around them. Why hate on inventors who create something cool just because it doesn’t quite work as well for all groups of people? Surely this also left a gap in the market—someone could have optimized film for darker skin tones and made a lot of money?”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“&nbsp;‘Hating’ is much too strong a word to describe the article, so much so that invoking it in a thread like this is a big upping of the flamewar ante,” Gackle replied, in the thread. He pointed the user to the site guidelines, encouraging more constructive input. He acknowledged that it was “hard to resist” inflammatory language “when a topic stirs up powerful emotions”:</p><blockquote><p>This creates a need for relief, and venting that energy in the form of extreme words is one way to get relief. Unfortunately, it doesn’t relieve anything at a community level. It just tosses the hot potato around in a way that only makes the potato hotter and more painful to the one who catches it next. What provides relief at a community level is when people find ability in themselves to acknowledge truth in what the other is saying.</p></blockquote><p>Over the years, Gackle and Bell have come to recognize their own triggers—patterns of online discourse that enrage them, depress them, or make them want to walk away. “In terms of the psychological experience of doing this job, all of your buttons are being pushed on a regular basis,” Gackle said. He now knows that it will be hard for him to keep his composure when he is being falsely accused or completely misread. (“That’s pretty much what some of the users do all day—accuse the moderators of doing something that they didn’t,” he said.)</p><p>Bell, for his part, becomes soul-weary when exposed to the unceasing spectacle of “people treating other people poorly.” “My reaction for things that get me is depressive,” Bell said. “Rather than respond outwardly, I have that internal depressive response. The issue for me is that this thing I’m very sensitive to is present in nearly everything.”</p><p>Gackle looked on as Bell spoke, then turned to me. “The sheer quantity of it is so overwhelming that one does have a depressive reaction, a hopeless reaction to it, at times,” he said. “I realized at some point that my feelings about it were like the feelings of a child trying to keep the family together. When the family is five million people, that’s a pretty tall order. It isn’t something that’s achievable. One has to learn to let go of them.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, dang is not adding anything to the conversation,” a user wrote, in the thread about race and photography. “He just enjoys virtue signaling. Hard!”</p><p>As Hacker News has grown, it has become the subject of both scrutiny and parody. A Twitter account, @shit_hn_says, highlights standout quotes from the comments section. (“If you want to do business with Iran, why don’t you just use Bitcoin?”) A hashtag, #HNwatch, collects screenshots of racist, sexist, xenophobic, and otherwise offensive or bizarre Hacker News comments. (“As a white man, I have concerns that my ethnic/gender group is being persecuted.” “In a way, the brains of startup founders and those below poverty lines work in the same way.”) Detractors refer to it as “the orange Web site,” a way of demonstrating both insider familiarity and exasperation.</p><p>N-gate, a satirical Web site with the slogan “We can’t both be right” (a NAND gate is a kind of logic gate that only outputs “false” if all of its inputs read “true”), offers a weekly summary of Hacker News discussions, dubbed “webshit weekly.” The N-gate entry about a Hacker News discussion of a <em>Times</em> article on the crashes of two Boeing 737 airliners, in Indonesia and Ethiopia, is typical. “Discussing a pair of crashes that killed almost three hundred and fifty people,” it reads, “Hacker News can’t decide whether the failure was one of user experience or branding. Other Hackernews”—as it calls commenters—“think that this plane would have worked better if it were designed by programmers with a tendency to work late for free. A majority of the comments are Hackernews incorrecting one another about FAA regulations, avionics, and lift.”</p><p>The proprietor of N-gate is an engineer who grew up in Palo Alto and now lives in the Pacific Northwest, where he works in high-performance computing. He agreed to exchange e-mails on condition of anonymity. “Almost every post deals with the same topics: these are people who spend their lives trying to identify all the ways they can extract money from others without quite going to jail,” he wrote. “They’re people who are convinced that they are too special for rules, and too smart for education. They don’t regard themselves as inhabiting the world the way other people do; they’re secret royalty, detached from society’s expectations and unfailingly outraged when faced with normal consequences for bad decisions. Society, and especially economics, is a logic puzzle where you just have to find the right set of loopholes to win the game. Rules are made to be slipped past, never stopping to consider why someone might have made those rules to start with. Silicon Valley has an ethics problem, and ‘Hacker’ ‘News’ is where it’s easiest to see.”</p><p>For decades, the phrase “Eternal September” has been used to describe the tipping point for a message board or online community—the inclusion, or invasion, of new users who dramatically change the existing subculture. (The term originated in September, 1993, after America Online made Usenet, a decades-old message-board system, accessible to many of its members, who were new to the Internet.) The creation of Startup News was a response to Reddit’s Eternal September; some of the problems with which Gackle and Bell are grappling can be traced to a similar phenomenon at Hacker News. The question they face now is whether the site’s original culture can be responsibly scaled up, or adapted, to make space for a more inclusive, wider-ranging vision of technology.</p><p>Gackle and Bell continue to believe in the value of “intellectual curiosity” as a goal. They speak of it more as a relative state than a fixed condition, using terms like “freshness” and “excitement” and “surprise and delight.” They are hopeful that, as Hacker News continues to grow, it will become, simultaneously, more diverse, more interesting, and more humane, while remaining in some fundamental sense a single community with a common goal. “The much larger sites, like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit, all scaled by sharding,” Gackle told me, over e-mail. “HN has no shards. We have no social graph either. Everybody is in it together whether they like it or not.”</p><p>“Intellectual curiosity is everywhere, and it’s present in all demographics,” Bell said, in the conference room. “We want Hacker News to grow in all demographics, because there’s just intellectually interesting contributions from all of those communities—a greater diversity of content, of conversations, of topics, et cetera.” (He and Gackle have discussed diversifying their team, and adding a third moderator who is non-white, non-male, and, Bell joked, “non-balding.” Gackle clarified: “We've talked to each other about that. But we wouldn't make it a requirement.”) And yet the influx of outsiders doesn’t just change a community; it exposes its assumptions. The tech industry as a whole is having its own Eternal September. The world, with all its experiences and opinions, has come flooding in, and technologists are now reassessing the consequences of the systems and structures they have built or inherited. Some of these systems are social, and include the general modes of thought and expression that Hacker News embodies.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Outside the conference room, it was early evening. Through the frosted glass, we could see the shapes of Y Combinator’s employees shrugging on their backpacks and depositing their mugs in the kitchen sink. “It might seem like ‘intellectual curiosity’ isn’t primarily an ethical concern,” Gackle said. “But it actually turns out that those things are deeply related. There’s something about the way that curiosity works: it needs a kind of gentleness.”</p><p>A few weeks after meeting with Gackle and Bell, I checked Hacker News to see what commenters were saying about a <em>Times</em> story on the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes’s antitrust work with the Federal Trade Commission. Users speculated about Hughes’s personal motivations and asked whether he had the knowledge necessary to help the government break up Facebook. Elsewhere on the site, people discussed California’s housing crisis (“The whole problem could be solved if we gave people the choice of voting where they work rather than where they live”) and a new scripting language, ChaiScript (“There’s no inherent reason a header-only library should significantly impact compile times, aside from the fact that the authors usually don’t have the foresight to make it efficient”). Skipping from thread to thread felt a bit like arriving at a party where half the room was sipping non-alcoholic shrubs and the other half had spent the afternoon tailgating in a stadium parking lot.</p><p>In the comments for a research paper, on ScienceDaily, about the evolutionary factors that may have been responsible for making humans the only mammals prone to heart attacks, a user criticized the study for having been conducted on mice. “Another couch biologist, there’s one in every thread,” posted a second user. “Thanks for all the observations, we really hadn’t thought of any of that, you single-handedly salvaged modern biological research!”</p><p>Gackle stepped in to ask the user not to break the site guidelines, and to behave more in the intended spirit of Hacker News. “Fair enough,” the user wrote; I felt a small rush of triumph, and pride, on Gackle’s behalf. Then, from the user, a follow-up question: “Why is this low-effort criticism of biology allowed?”</p><p>“It’s allowed in the sense that people are allowed to be wrong and/or ignorant because that’s what most of us are on most topics,” Gackle replied. “We can’t stop that any more than King Canute”—the ancient king of the North Sea who demonstrated the limits of his power by trying, in an ironic spirit, to command the sea—“could stop the waves. The important question is, what’s the best way to handle it if we want to have an internet forum that doesn’t suck? Experience teaches that the answer is: the patient supply of correct information by people who do know about a topic.”</p><p>I thought about the relentless patience and good faith that this style of moderation work required. I pictured Bell and Gackle as swimmers in a resistance pool, doing slow crawls against the currents of online discourse. I hoped the project of Hacker News was worth the effort. I wondered if their work might show that tech really does need humanism—that better online communities can be built one relationship at a time. Then my eyes moved down the thread, where a third user had left a new comment. It read: “King Canute was supposed to stop the tide, you couch alluder.”</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

Alvarez told The Times, recalling a recent conversation with her brother. “It was very healing for us. I never knew all that he carried, like the emotional burden of not protecting his younger sister.”</p><p>In a telephone interview from Ironwood State Prison in Blythe, Perez said the more frequent contact with his sister was making him a better brother and better person.</p><p>By having these conversations, he said, he and others in prison “are able to kind of really rehabilitate our emotional awareness, and really start to have empathy for our family members that are struggling out there on the streets, so that we can create some type of emotion in ourselves other than always be worried about what is happening on the inside.”</p><p>Prisoner advocates and state correction officials hope the benefits will go even further by speeding rehabilitation, reducing recidivism and easing the way for reentry into society. </p><p>“Incarcerated people who are connected to their families and support systems are more likely to come home and stay home,” said Bianca Tylek, executive director of Worth Rises, a prison reform organization. “That means they are less likely to reengage in criminal activity and more likely to be productive neighbors for all of us.

was optimistic that the increased family contact would help incarcerated people “build and maintain relationships that are critical to achieving their rehabilitative goals.”</p><p>Before the law, the

In June, the overall prison phone bill increased more than tenfold, to nearly $2.4 million.</p><p>Oscar Bonilla, a formerly incarcerated person released in 2020, recalls the toll of long periods of not having phone calls. Though he understood his family could not afford the fee, he nevertheless felt forgotten and resentful.</p><p>Having free phone calls during his incarceration would have strengthened the relationship he had with his family, he said.</p><p>It would have “helped my own mental health and my own emotional state of being while I was in there,” he added. “It would have really had me feeling a little happier instead of being in a depressed state of mind. Having that bridge to your family is huge.”</p><p>Separation wore heavily on family members, too.</p><p>Ruth Mancilla, 43, of Duarte, has two brothers in prison. She said the family’s phone bill sometimes hit $900 in the early 2000s. “That was like a full rent back then,” she said.</p><p>She recalled the anguish she felt when one of her brothers would call her

then.” Before the new law, the cost of calls kept many families from talking with incarcerated loved ones as much as they would’ve liked.</p>   <p>(Dania Maxwell / Los Angeles Times)</p>   </div>  </figure></div><p>Even though calls are free now, she said that it is hard to break the old habit of second-guessing whether she should pick up.</p><p>“It is kind of a little traumatic,” she said. “I still have to stop and pause at times, because it is one of those ‘too good to be true’ type of things.”</p><p>Gabriel Bonilla, 47, who was convicted of murder in 2000, said the free calls had enabled him to reunite with his three sons, and to share his efforts to rehabilitate himself in prison, including his completion of a degree in May. </p><p>“Previously we had no communication and I was only judged [by] the worst day of my life,” Bonilla, no relation to Oscar, said in a phone call from Folsom State Prison. “I feel a lot better as a father, as a grandfather and as a husband because I am able to communicate with them. I am able to tell them my accomplishments [in prison] and everything that I have done to improve myself so that I’m not looked at for what I did to get myself in here.”</p><p>Free prison phone calls are among a series of recent reforms to overhaul the state’s prison system. </p><p>In March, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that San Quentin State Prison — California’s oldest — would be transformed into a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-03-16/newsom-wants-to-transform-san-quentin-using-a-scandinavian-model">“Scandinavian model,”</a> with a focus on education and job training to ease reentry into society and reduce rates of reoffending. The reforms seek to “completely reimagine what prison means,” Newsom said.</p><p>In June, the state closed all of its juvenile prisons in favor of detaining youth at county jails. The state is closing some prisons, and the corrections department has begun offering free transportation for families to visit incarcerated relatives.</p><p>During the pandemic, California prisons rolled out tablets that give incarcerated people limited digital access, including to video calls, text messages and music streaming.</p><p>However, those services are not free, and families have to pay for them if incarcerated relatives are among those who have received the tablets. Video calls cost 20 cents per minute and text messages cost 5 cents per message, according to rates <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/family-resources/tablets/" target="_blank">published by the state corrections agency.</a> </p> <p>Even before the new law, the cost of prison calls was drastically reduced after the Federal Communications Commission cracked down on hidden service fees and imposed rate caps on the prison telecom industry. A new law signed by President Biden and taking effect in 2024 will give the commission even greater powers to regulate the industry.</p><p>In some states, prison calls were costing as much as $14 a minute. A 15-minute phone call to a number within California peaked at $6.20 in 2007, and at $17.30 for out-of-state calls, according to the department.</p><div data-click="enhancement"

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>The central idea of my forthcoming book, </span><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anxious-Generation-Rewiring-Childhood-Epidemic/dp/0593655036" rel="">The Anxious Generation</a></em><span>, is that we have overprotected children in the real world, where they need a lot of free play and autonomy,while underprotecting them online, where they are not developmentally ready for much of what happens to them. Much of my thinking about the importance of free play comes from </span><a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/psychology/people/affiliated-and-emeritus/peter-gray.html" rel="">Peter Gray</a><span>, a professor of psychology at Boston College who is one of the world’s leading experts on the psychology of play. See his </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg-GEzM7iTk&amp;ab_channel=TEDxTalks" rel="">powerful TED talk</a><span>, where he lays out the evolutionary origins of play—a necessity for all young mammals. He then shows how we have systematically deprived children of free play since the 1970s and shows that adolescents' mental health has declined substantially over the same period. He notes that this is a correlation, not proof of causation, although experiments with animals support the claim that play deprivation causes anxiety and poor social development.</span></p><p><span>Peter gave that talk in 2014. Since then, the mental health of children and adolescents has worsened, and evidence has increased showing that Peter was correct. Peter recently published a major review article in the Journal of Pediatrics titled </span><a href="https://www.petergray.org/_files/ugd/b4b4f9_f2cb98d004af4ebf9644c8daa30b040e.pdf" rel="">Decline in Independent Activity as a Cause of Decline in Children’s Mental Well-being: Summary of the Evidence</a><span>. I think it’s among the most important essays ever written on play. I was planning to write a summary of the article for the After Babel Substack, but a few days ago, I got Peter’s own summary of the article, which he posted on his new Substack, </span><em>Play Makes Us Human</em><span>, which you can find and subscribe to here:</span></p><p><span>I asked Peter if I could repost his </span><a href="https://petergray.substack.com/p/15-play-deficit-as-cause-of-decline" rel="">Substack essay</a><span> at After Babel. He said yes, and you’ll find it below. Peter and I disagree on whether </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/social-media-mental-illness-epidemic" rel="">smartphones and social media are also major causes of the teen mental health crisis</a><span>, as you’ll see. But we both agree that play deprivation is a major contributing cause and that anyone who is serious about the mental health of children and teens (and adults) should be up in arms about what America and many other countries have done to prevent children from playing in the ways they need and want to play.</span></p><p><span>I note that Peter is a co-founder, with me, Lenore Skenazy, and Daniel Shuchman, of </span><a href="https://letgrow.org/" rel="">LetGrow.org</a><span>, where we both serve on the board. LetGrow offers many resources for </span><a href="https://letgrow.org/program/parents-and-families/" rel="">parents</a><span>, </span><a href="https://letgrow.org/program/educators/" rel="">schools</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://letgrow.org/program/policy-and-legislation/" rel="">state legislators</a><span> that want to act on Peter’s advice and introduce more free play and autonomy into children’s lives. </span></p><p><span>— </span><em><strong>Jon Haidt</strong></em></p><p><span>In this letter, I summarize the contents of an article that anthropologist David Lancy, developmental psychologist David Bjorklund, and I published recently in the Journal of Pediatrics. For the full account, including citations to research supporting each point, see the article </span><a href="https://www.petergray.org/_files/ugd/b4b4f9_f2cb98d004af4ebf9644c8daa30b040e.pdf" rel="">here</a><span>. Throughout this letter, I use the term “children” to refer to everyone under 18 years old unless otherwise specified.</span></p><p>We began the article with two very well-established and disturbing facts.</p><p>The first fact is that over the past 5 decades or more we have seen, in the United States, a continuous and overall huge decline in children’s freedom to play or engage in any activities independent of direct adult monitoring and control. With every decade children have become less free to play, roam, and explore alone or with other children away from adults, less free to occupy public spaces without an adult guard, and less free to have a part-time job where they can demonstrate their capacity for responsible self-control. Among the causes of this change are a large increase in societal fears that children are in danger if not constantly guarded, a large increase in the time that children must spend in school and at schoolwork at home, and a large increase in the societal view that children’s time is best spent in adult-directed school-like activities, such as formal sports and lessons, even when not in school.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16d218a3-b808-49ea-879f-14f67cf330bf_1080x675.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16d218a3-b808-49ea-879f-14f67cf330bf_1080x675.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16d218a3-b808-49ea-879f-14f67cf330bf_1080x675.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16d218a3-b808-49ea-879f-14f67cf330bf_1080x675.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16d218a3-b808-49ea-879f-14f67cf330bf_1080x675.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16d218a3-b808-49ea-879f-14f67cf330bf_1080x675.jpeg" width="1080" height="675" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/16d218a3-b808-49ea-879f-14f67cf330bf_1080x675.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:675,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:138002,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16d218a3-b808-49ea-879f-14f67cf330bf_1080x675.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16d218a3-b808-49ea-879f-14f67cf330bf_1080x675.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16d218a3-b808-49ea-879f-14f67cf330bf_1080x675.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16d218a3-b808-49ea-879f-14f67cf330bf_1080x675.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>The second undisputed fact is that over these same decades, rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide among young people have increased enormously. Using data from standard clinical questionnaires administered to school-aged children over the decades, researchers have estimated that the rates of what we now call major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder increased by roughly 5- to 8-fold during the second half of the 20</span><sup>th</sup><span> century, and other measures indicate that they have continued to increase during the first two decades of the 21</span><sup>st</sup><span> century.</span></p><p>Perhaps the most compelling and disturbing evidence comes from research on suicides and suicidal thoughts. Data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that the rate of suicide among children younger than age 15 rose 3.5-fold between 1950 and 2005 and by another 2.4-fold between 2005 and 2020. By 2019, suicide was the second leading cause of death for children from age 10 through 15, behind only unintentional injury (including traffic fatalities). Moreover, the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System survey revealed that during the previous year 18.8% of US high school students seriously considered attempting suicide, 15.7% made a suicide plan, 8.9% attempted suicide one or more times, and 2.5% made a suicide attempt requiring medical treatment.</p><p>Such findings led the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and Children’s Hospital Association to issue, in 2021, a joint statement to the Biden administration urging that child and adolescent mental health be declared a “national emergency.”</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/the-play-deficit?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/the-play-deficit?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>You would think it would be obvious that taking away free play and other freedoms to act independently would make children anxious, depressed, and in some cases suicidal, but we adults are remarkably skilled at burying our heads in the sand on this issue. If you read the popular press, you would think the problem is screens and social media, or almost anything else other than the fact that we have more or less locked children up around the clock. So, here is some of the evidence we spelled out in the Journal of Pediatrics article.</p><p>Research, proving what should be obvious, shows that play is a direct source of children’s happiness. When children are asked to depict or describe activities that make them happy, they depict or describe scenes of play. There is also research showing that when children are allowed a little more play—such as when schools offer a little more recess—the kids become happier. Research also reveals that children consider play to be activity that they themselves initiate and control. If an adult is directing it, it’s not play. The joy of play is the joy of freedom from adult control. Other research reveals that the rates of emotional breakdowns and suicides among school-aged children decline markedly every summer when schools shut down and rise again when schools open. During the summer children have at least some more opportunity for independent activity than they do during the school year. There is also evidence that teens who have part-time jobs are happier than those who don’t, because of the sense of independence and confidence they gain from the job.</p><p><span>Beyond promoting immediate mental well-being, play and other independent activities build mental capacities and attitudes that foster future well-being. Research shows that people of all ages who have a strong </span><em>internal locus of control</em><span> (internal LOC),</span><em> </em><span>that is, a strong sense of being able to solve their own problems and take charge of their own lives, are much less likely to suffer from anxiety and depression than those with a weaker internal LOC. Obviously, however, to develop a strong internal LOC a person needs considerable experience of actually being in control, which is not possible if you are continuously being monitored and controlled by others.</span></p><p>Other research has assessed relationships between the amount of time children have to direct their own activities and psychological characteristics predictive of future mental health. Such research has revealed significant positive correlations between the amount of self-structured time (largely involving free play) young children have and (1) scores on tests of executive functioning (ability to create and follow through on a plan to solve a set of problems); (2) indices of emotional control and social ability; and (3) scores, 2 years later, on a measure of self-regulation.</p><p>Moreover, two retrospective studies with adults have shown that those who recall more instances of independent play when they were children are, by various indices, happier and more successful in adulthood than those who recall less such independence. And research with college students reveals that those with over-controlling parents (as assessed with questionnaires) fare more poorly psychologically than those whose parents are less controlling. These and other correlational studies all point in the same direction. Opportunities to take more control of your own life when young predict better future well-being.</p><p><span>Dozens of research studies, conducted with people of a wide range of ages, have led to the conclusion that mental health for all of us depends on our ability to satisfy three basic psychological needs—the needs for </span><em>autonomy</em><span>, </span><em>competence</em><span>, and </span><em>relatedness</em><span>. The logic underlying this is straightforward. To feel in charge of our life, to feel we can meet the bumps in the roads of life with equanimity, we must feel free to choose our own paths (</span><em>autonomy</em><span>); feel sufficiently skilled to pursue those paths (</span><em>competence</em><span>); and have friends and colleagues for support, including emotional support (</span><em>relatedness</em><span>).</span></p><p><span>How do children satisfy these psychological needs? They do so through play and other self-chosen, self-controlled activities. Play and other self-directed activities are, by definition, autonomous; such activities build skills (competence) in endeavors that children care about and that prepare them for adulthood (see </span><a href="https://petergray.substack.com/p/5-play-is-how-children-practice-all" rel="">Letter #5</a><span>); and such activities are the primary means by which children make friends (relatedness).</span></p><p>By depriving children of play and other independent activities we are depriving them of the experiences they need to grow up with the confidence and ability to run their own lives.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/the-play-deficit/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/the-play-deficit/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p><span>So, what can you, I, and others do about this? Too many people are focusing on drugs and therapy, as if something is wrong with the kids that needs correction, and not enough of us are thinking about prevention. Prevention would involve bringing normal childhood back to children. Children are designed to play and explore and thereby becoming increasingly independent as they grow older. Their instincts tell them that something is seriously wrong if they don’t have such independence. </span><a href="https://petergray.substack.com/p/14-enabling-childrens-play" rel="">Letter #14</a><span> outlines some ways to bring more play into children’s lives in today’s overprotective world, but we also need to work for change in the larger societal constraints on children’s lives.</span></p><p><span>If you wish to see more of the research evidence behind what I have described here, including reference citations, you can do so by examining our </span><a href="https://www.petergray.org/_files/ugd/b4b4f9_f2cb98d004af4ebf9644c8daa30b040e.pdf" rel="">article </a><span>in the </span><em>Journal of Pediatrics.</em></p><p><strong>Postscript</strong></p><p>To subscribe to Peter’s substack, enter your email address here:</p><p>If you’re not already a subscriber to the After Babel substack, please enter your email address here:</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/the-play-deficit?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/the-play-deficit?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

                   Read why "Web Environment Integrity" is terrible, and why we must vocally oppose it now. Google's latest maneuver, if we don't act to stop it, threatens our freedom to explore the Internet with browsers of our choice.

<p>Using a free browser is now more important than ever. We've written
<a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/googles-decision-to-deprecate-jpeg-xl-emphasizes-the-need-for-browser-choice-and-free-formats">recently</a> on this topic, but the issue we wrote about there was
minor compared to the gross injustice Google is now attempting to
force down the throats of web users around the world. The so-called
"Web Environment Integrity" (WEI) is the worst stunt we've seen from
them in some time. Beginning its life as an innocuous, if worrying,
policy document posted to Microsoft <a href="https://rupertbenwiser.github.io/Web-Environment-Integrity/">GitHub</a>, Google has now
fast-tracked its development into their <a href="https://github.com/chromium/chromium/commit/6f47a22906b2899412e79a2727355efa9cc8f5bd">Chromium browser</a>. At its
current rate of progress, WEI will be upon us in no time.</p>
<p>By giving developers an API through which they can approve certain
browser configurations while forbidding others, WEI is a tremendous
step toward the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/11/users-advertisers-we-are-all-trapped-in-the-enshittification-of-the-internet">"enshittification"</a> of the web as a whole. Many of
us have grown up with a specific <em>idea</em> of the Internet, the notion of
it as a collection of hyperlinked pages that can be accessed by a wide
variety of different machines, programs, and operating systems. WEI is
this idea's antithesis.</p>
<p>Compared to its staggering potential effects, the technical means
through which WEI will accomplish its ends is relatively simple.
Before serving a web page, a server can ask a third-party
"verification" service to make sure that the user's browsing
environment has not been "tampered" with. A translation of the
policy's terminology will help us here: this Google-owned server will
be asked to make sure that the browser does not deviate in <em>any</em> way
from Google's accepted browser configuration, precluding any
meaningful use of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">four freedoms</a>. It is not far-fetched to
imagine a future in which sites simply refuse to serve pages to users
running free browsers or free operating systems. If WEI isn't stopped
<em>now</em>, that future will come sooner than we think.</p>
<p>While Web Environment Integrity has a policy document that attempts to
explain valid ways in which it could be used, these are all non-issues
compared to the way that we <em>know</em> it will be used. It will be used by
governments to ensure that only their officially "approved" (read:
backdoored) browsers are able to access the Internet; it will be used
by corporations like Netflix to further Digital Restrictions
Management (DRM); it will be used by Google to deny access to their
services unless you are using a browser that gels with their profit
margin.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, Google's official policy was "don't be evil." With
the rapid progress they've made on Web Environment Integrity in such a
short time, we can say very safely that their policy is now to
<em>pioneer</em> evil. As we write this, talented and well-paid Google
engineers and executives are working to dismantle what makes the web
<em>the web.</em> Given that Google is one of the largest corporations on
the planet, our only hope of saving the Internet as we know it is a
clear and principled stance for freedom, a collective upholding of the
communal principles on which the web was based.</p>
<p>Let us repeat: there is absolutely no legitimate justification for
WEI. The use cases that the policy document highlights are nothing
compared to its real use case, which is developing a method to obtain
complete and total restriction of the free Internet.</p>
<p>We urge everyone involved in a decision-making capacity at Google to
consider the principles on which the web was founded, and to carefully
contemplate whether Web Environment Integrity aligns with those
principles. We hope that they will realize WEI's fundamental
incompatibility with the free Internet and cease work on the standard
immediately.</p>
<p>And if they don't? Well, they ought to be ashamed.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">

				
<p>It's one of the mysteries of nature: How does the axolotl, a small salamander, boast a superhero-like ability to regrow nearly any part of its body? For years, scientists have studied the amazing regenerative properties of the axolotl to inform wound healing in humans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, Stanford Medicine researchers have made a leap forward in understanding what sets the axolotl apart from other animals. Axolotls, they discovered, have an ultra-sensitive version of mTOR, a molecule that acts as an on-off switch for protein production. And, like survivalists who fill their basements with non-perishable food for hard times, axolotl cells stockpile messenger RNA molecules, which contain genetic instructions for producing proteins. The combination of an easily activated mTOR molecule and a repository of ready-to-use mRNAs means that after an injury, axolotl cells can quickly produce the proteins needed for tissue regeneration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new findings were <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06365-1">published</a> July 26 in <em>Nature</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Until now, it has been difficult to pinpoint a specific change in a single molecule in axolotls that was so critical for regenerative potential," said Maria Barna, an associate professor of genetics and the senior author of the paper. "We've made significant headway toward understanding how we may eventually manipulate the mTOR pathway to boost regenerative potential in humans."&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-from-mrna-to-protein"><strong>From mRNA to protein</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>In the past, researchers trying to figure out how the axolotl regrows entire body parts -- including legs, tails, eyes and even the heart -- focused on how levels of mRNA molecules changed after an axolotl has an injury. Scientists have long used mRNA molecule levels as a proxy for protein levels; after all, mRNA must exist before a protein can be produced. However, these studies only shed light on what happens to the production of mRNA molecules after injury -- not what happens to the translation of mRNA into protein products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"There are hundreds of mRNA transcripts that appear after a wound, but researchers were really struggling to figure out what it was about salamanders that could explain their regenerative potential," Barna said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her lab took a different approach, focusing on which mRNA molecules near a wound were attached to ribosomes, little molecular machines that create proteins. That helped the scientists zero in on which proteins were being made, rather than which mRNA molecules loitered near the injury site. Usually, when cells encounter stress (such as after an injury) they decrease overall protein production to save energy, so Barna's group expected to see fewer mRNA molecules bound to ribosomes. Instead, they saw more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It was a 180-degree flip when we realized that when an axolotl loses a limb, it actually increases protein synthesis despite the energy cost," Barna said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further experiments showed that axolotl cells 'stockpile' mRNA, translating less than 20% of it at any given time. When the researchers analyzed how axolotls respond to injury, they found that protein synthesis is activated, leading to the translation of hundreds of stockpiled transcripts. That long-term storage also explained the speed at which protein synthesis occurred during regeneration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We had a gut feeling that looking at protein synthesis more closely would be important, " said Olena Zhulyn, PhD, postdoctoral scholar and lead author of the study. "But never in a million years did we expect that protein synthesis would be the key to the mystery of the axolotl's regeneration."&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>A connection to mTOR</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>A question remained: What was activating the mRNAs and causing them to bind to ribosomes after axolotls lose a body part? The researchers noticed that many of the stockpiled mRNA molecules had a shared sequence of nucleotides at one end of the mRNA which was known to be regulated by the enzyme mTOR to promote protein production.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research found that the axolotl mTOR protein is highly sensitive -- the axolotl variety contained a genetic alteration, an expansion in sequence, seen only in axolotl and related salamanders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investigating further, Barna and her team collaborated with researchers at University of California, San Francisco to probe the structural differences between axolotl mTOR and mammalian mTOR.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In humans and mice, mTOR (and resulting protein production) activates only when there's a surplus of nutrients. In other words, mammalian cells use mTOR to make proteins only in the best of times. But in axolotls, after an injury causes cell damage and the breakdown of many molecules, the small rush in loose nutrients is enough to flip the ultra-sensitive mTOR to its active state, turning on the cellular factories that make new proteins.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Finding this genetic change was a shock -- mTOR is an ancient enzyme that is the same in virtually all organisms," said Zhulyn. "But in axolotls we were seeing evolution of new sequences and a structure that changed its fundamental properties."&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Barna and her colleagues blocked mTOR with a drug used to prevent protein production and cell division in cancers, the animals were no longer able to regrow limbs. The axolotl mTOR is hypersensitive to stimulation (in this case, injury) but is not more active than mammalian mTOR, they found. That's key, said Barna -- hyperactive mTOR has been linked to tumor growth in many human cancers. Given that the axolotl mTOR doesn't show hyperactivity, that could explain the remarkable cancer resistance seen in axolotls, she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More research is needed to probe whether changing or stimulating mTOR in humans could improve wound healing or spur the regeneration of damaged, diseased organs, Barna said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I think there are a still a lot of lessons to be learned about how this tight control of mRNA translation is allowing wound healing and tissue regeneration," said Barna. "There is a whole new world to be discovered when it comes to both the basic biology of translation and healing."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>I write a lot about technologies that I found hard to learn about. A
while back my friend Sumana asked me an interesting question – why are these
things so hard to learn about? Why do they seem so mysterious?</p>

<p>For example, take DNS. We’ve been using DNS since the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt">80s</a> (for more than 35 years!). It’s
used in every website on the internet. And it’s pretty stable – in a lot of
ways, it works the exact same way it did 30 years ago.</p>

<p>But it took me YEARS to figure out how to confidently debug DNS issues, and
I’ve seen a lot of other programmers struggle with debugging DNS problems as
well. So what’s going on?</p>

<p>Here are a couple of thoughts about why learning to troubleshoot DNS problems
is hard.</p>

<p>(I’m not going to explain DNS very much in this post, see <a href="https://implement-dns.wizardzines.com/">Implement DNS in a Weekend</a> or <a href="https://jvns.ca/categories/dns/">my DNS blog posts</a> for more about how DNS works)</p>

<h3 id="a-lot-of-the-system-is-hidden">a lot of the system is hidden</h3>

<p>When you make a DNS request on your computer, the basic story is:</p>

<ol>
<li>your computer makes a request to a server called <strong>resolver</strong></li>
<li>the resolver checks its cache, and makes requests to some other servers called <strong>authoritative nameservers</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some things you don’t see:</p>

<ul>
<li>the resolver’s <strong>cache</strong>. What’s in there?</li>
<li>which <strong>library code</strong> on your computer is making the DNS request (is it libc
<code>getaddrinfo</code>? if so, is it the getaddrinfo from glibc, or musl, or apple? is
it your browser’s DNS code? is it a different custom DNS implementation?).
All of these options behave slightly differently and have different
configuration, approaches to caching, available features, etc. For example musl DNS didn’t support TCP until <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/16/alpine_linux_318/">early 2023</a>.</li>
<li>the <strong>conversation</strong> between the resolver and the authoritative nameservers. I
think a lot of DNS issues would be SO simple to understand if you could
magically get a trace of exactly which authoritative nameservers were
queried downstream during your request, and what they said. (like, what if
you could run <code>dig +debug google.com</code> and it gave you a bunch of extra
debugging information?)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dealing-with-hidden-systems">dealing with hidden systems</h3>

<p>A couple of ideas for how to deal with hidden systems</p>

<ul>
<li>just teaching people what the hidden systems are makes a huge difference. For
a long time I had no idea that my computer had many different DNS libraries
that were used in different situations and I was confused about this for
literally years. This is a big part of my approach.</li>
<li>with <a href="https://messwithdns.net/">Mess With DNS</a> we tried out this “fishbowl”
approach where it shows you some parts of the system (the conversation with
the resolver and the authoritative nameserver) that are normally hidden</li>
<li>I feel like it would be extremely cool to extend DNS to include a “debugging
information” section. Like maybe it could be in the <code>additional</code> section and
we could use TCP DNS so so that the response could include unlimited debug
info? There’s probably prior art here that I don’t know about.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="confusing-tools">confusing tools</h3>

<p>Even though a lot of DNS stuff is hidden, there are a lot of ways to figure out
what’s going on by using <code>dig</code>.</p>

<p>For example, you can use <code>dig +norecurse</code> to figure out if a given DNS resolver
has a particular record in its cache. <code>8.8.8.8</code> seems to return a <code>SERVFAIL</code>
response if the response isn’t cached.</p>

<p>here’s what that looks like for <code>google.com</code></p>

<pre><code>$ dig +norecurse  @8.8.8.8 google.com
;; Got answer:
;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 11653
;; flags: qr ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:
; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 512
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;google.com.			IN	A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
google.com.		21	IN	A	172.217.4.206

;; Query time: 57 msec
;; SERVER: 8.8.8.8#53(8.8.8.8)
;; WHEN: Fri Jul 28 10:50:45 EDT 2023
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 55
</code></pre>

<p>and for <code>homestarrunner.com</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ dig +norecurse  @8.8.8.8 homestarrunner.com
;; Got answer:
;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: SERVFAIL, id: 55777
;; flags: qr ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:
; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 512
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;homestarrunner.com.		IN	A

;; Query time: 52 msec
;; SERVER: 8.8.8.8#53(8.8.8.8)
;; WHEN: Fri Jul 28 10:51:01 EDT 2023
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 47
</code></pre>

<p>Here you can see we got a normal <code>NOERROR</code> response for <code>google.com</code> (which is
in <code>8.8.8.8</code>’s cache) but a <code>SERVFAIL</code> for <code>homestarrunner.com</code> (which isn’t).
This doesn’t mean there’s no DNS record <code>homestarrunner.com</code> (there is!), it’s
just not cached).</p>

<p>But this output is really confusing to read if you’re not used to it! Here are a few things that I think are weird about it:</p>

<ol>
<li>the headings are weird (there’s <code>-&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;-</code>, <code>flags:</code>, <code>OPT PSEUDOSECTION:</code>, <code>QUESTION SECTION:</code>, <code>ANSWER SECTION:</code>)</li>
<li>the spacing is weird (why is the no newline between <code>OPT PSEUDOSECTION</code> and <code>QUESTION SECTION</code>?)</li>
<li><code>MSG SIZE  rcvd: 47</code> is weird (are there other fields in <code>MSG SIZE</code> other than <code>rcvd</code>? what are they?)</li>
<li>it says that there’s 1 record in the ADDITIONAL section but doesn’t show it, you have to somehow magically know that the “OPT PSEUDOSECTION” record is actually in the additional section</li>
</ol>

<p>In general <code>dig</code>’s output has the feeling of a script someone wrote in an adhoc
way that grew organically over time and not something that was intentionally
designed.</p>

<h3 id="dealing-with-confusing-tools">dealing with confusing tools</h3>

<p>some ideas for improving on confusing tools:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>explain the output</strong>. For example I wrote <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/12/04/how-to-use-dig/">how to use dig</a> explaining how <code>dig</code>’s
output works and how to configure it to give you a shorter output by default</li>
<li><strong>make new, more friendly tools</strong>. For example for DNS there’s
<a href="https://github.com/ogham/dog">dog</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mr-karan/doggo">doggo</a> and <a href="https://dns-lookup.jvns.ca/">my dns lookup tool</a>. I think these are really cool but
personally I don’t use them because sometimes I want to do something a little
more advanced (like using <code>+norecurse</code>) and as far as I can tell neither
<code>dog</code> nor <code>doggo</code> support <code>+norecurse</code>. I’d rather use 1 tool for everything,
so I stick to <code>dig</code>. Replacing the breadth of functionality of <code>dig</code> is a
huge undertaking.</li>
<li><strong>make dig’s output a little more friendly</strong>. If I were better at C programming,
I might try to write a <code>dig</code> pull request that adds a <code>+human</code> flag to dig
that formats the long form output in a more structured and readable way,
maybe something like this:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>$ dig +human +norecurse  @8.8.8.8 google.com 
HEADER:
  opcode: QUERY
  status: NOERROR
  id: 11653
  flags: qr ra
  records: QUESTION: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

QUESTION SECTION:
  google.com.			IN	A

ANSWER SECTION:
  google.com.		21	IN	A	172.217.4.206
  
ADDITIONAL SECTION:
  EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 512
</code></pre>

<p>This makes the structure of the DNS response more clear – there’s the header, the
question, the answer, and the additional section.</p>

<p>We’ve learned a lot about how to design more user friendly command line tools
in the last 40 years and I think it would be cool to apply some of that
knowledge to some of our older crustier tools.</p>

<h3 id="weird-gotchas">weird gotchas</h3>

<p>DNS has some weird stuff that’s relatively common to run into, but pretty hard
to learn about if nobody tells you what’s going on. A few examples (there are more in <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/01/15/some-ways-dns-can-break/">some ways DNS can break</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>negative caching! (which I talk about in <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/05/08/new-talk-learning-dns-in-10-years/">this talk</a>) It
took me probably 5 years to realize that I shouldn’t visit a domain that
doesn’t have a DNS record yet, because then the <strong>nonexistance</strong> of that
record will be cached, and it gets cached for HOURS, and it’s really
annoying.</li>
<li>differences in <code>getaddrinfo</code> implementations: until <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/16/alpine_linux_318/">early 2023</a>, <code>musl</code> didn’t support TCP DNS</li>
<li>resolvers that ignore TTLs: if you set a TTL on your DNS records (like “5
minutes”), some resolvers will ignore those TTLs completely and cache the
records for longer, like maybe 24 hours instead</li>
<li>if you configure nginx wrong (<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/01/15/some-ways-dns-can-break/#problem-nginx-caching-dns-records-forever">like this</a>), it’ll cache DNS records forever.</li>
<li>how <a href="https://pracucci.com/kubernetes-dns-resolution-ndots-options-and-why-it-may-affect-application-performances.html">ndots</a> can make your Kubernetes DNS slow</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dealing-with-weird-gotchas">dealing with weird gotchas</h3>

<p>I don’t have as good answers here as I would like to, but knowledge about weird
gotchas is extremely hard won (again, it took me years to figure out negative
caching!) and it feels very silly to me that people have to rediscover them for
themselves over and over and over again.</p>

<p>A few ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>It’s incredibly helpful when people call out gotchas when explaining a topic. For example (leaving
DNS for a moment), Josh Comeau’s Flexbox intro explains this <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/#the-minimum-size-gotcha-11">minimum size gotcha</a>
which I ran into SO MANY times for several years before finally finding an
explanation of what was going on.</li>
<li>I’d love to see more community collections of common gotchas. For bash,
<a href="https://www.shellcheck.net/">shellcheck</a> is an incredible collection of bash
gotchas.</li>
</ul>

<p>One tricky thing about documenting DNS gotchas is that different people are
going to run into different gotchas – if you’re just configuring DNS for your
personal domain once every 3 years, you’re probably going to run into different
gotchas than someone who administrates DNS for a domain with heavy traffic.</p>

<p>A couple of more quick reasons:</p>

<h3 id="infrequent-exposure">infrequent exposure</h3>

<p>A lot of people only deal with DNS extremely infrequently. And of course if you
only touch DNS every 3 years it’s going to be harder to learn!</p>

<p>I think cheat sheets (like “here are the steps to changing your nameservers”)
can really help with this.</p>

<h3 id="it-s-hard-to-experiment-with">it’s hard to experiment with</h3>

<p>DNS can be scary to experiment with – you don’t want to mess up your domain.
We built <a href="https://messwithdns.net/">Mess With DNS</a> to make this one a little easier.</p>

<h3 id="that-s-all-for-now">that’s all for now</h3>

<p>I’d love to hear other thoughts about what makes DNS (or your favourite
mysterious technology) hard to learn.</p>

Given your skills, one of you should be able to get one (and the other can come as a spouse and apply for a work permit with the right visa type). After a few years with that, you can apply for a green card (permanent resident status). I know people who have renewed those for decades without becoming citizens. Or, after a few years with the green card, you can apply for citizenship.<p>I know lots of Brits and Canadians in California who have also followed this path.</p><p>A lot of talk in here about H1B visas, and that's probably because they're the most plentiful. But, that's not the only type of visa that people should be thinking about.

Yes, there are other options that aren't subject to the crazy and uncertain H-1B lottery such as the O-1 visa (which, without knowing more, you both probably would qualify for).

It's also generally easy for companies to hire those with PhDs (often via the O-1).

But looking further into it it takes at least 15 Months to process this stage of immigration, worst case scenario it could’ve been 50 months (4 year!!!)</p><p>This wouldn’t all be to bad but to add insult to injury it looks like I’m effectively barred from entering the US during this period and US customs can even bar me for 5 years from entering the country if I try.</p><p>I just feel incredibly sad about the fact that the way to go if you have a sweetheart in the US seems to be to illegally marry on a Tourist entry into the country…</p><p>The earliest the US would even respond to our inquiries is in 2024, which is frankly ridiculous.</p><p>There doesn’t seem to be any workarounds other than transferring on an L1 Visa between companies that are situated in Germany and the US, every other visa is single intend (i.e illegal if you plan to stay and the US gets to decided if you’re trying to do that)</p><p>I don’t understand what the US is scared of, taking their social benefits? Especially since 90% of the I130 are approved, there is no reason it takes that long or needs such rigorous vetting.</p><p>Peter if you know any better or disagree please let me know :(

But one correction: you are allowed to travel to the U.S. as a visitor while your green card application is pending; you just need to maintain a home abroad and not work when here. We've had spouses in the same situation spend  months and months in the U.S. while waiting for the green card process to run its course.</span></p></div></td></tr>

If one has been in the US illegally, as an adult, for more than 180 days, they have a three-year ban. After one year it becomes a 10-year ban. This applies to both visiting and immigration.

<h2><a href="https://capnproto.org/news/">News</a></h2>



<p>It’s been a little over ten years since the first release of Cap’n Proto, on April 1, 2013. Today I’m releasing version 1.0 of Cap’n Proto’s C++ reference implementation.</p>
<p>Don’t get too excited! There’s not actually much new. Frankly, I should have declared 1.0 a long time ago – probably around version 0.6 (in 2017) or maybe even 0.5 (in 2014). I didn’t mostly because there were a few advanced features (like three-party handoff, or shared-memory RPC) that I always felt like I wanted to finish before 1.0, but they just kept not reaching the top of my priority list. But the reality is that Cap’n Proto has been relied upon in production for a long time. In fact, you are using Cap’n Proto right now, to view this site, which is served by Cloudflare, which uses Cap’n Proto extensively (and is also my employer, although they used Cap’n Proto before they hired me). Cap’n Proto is used to encode millions (maybe billions) of messages and gigabits (maybe terabits) of data every single second of every day. As for those still-missing features, the real world has seemingly proven that they aren’t actually that important. (I still do want to complete them though.)</p>
<p>Ironically, the thing that finally motivated the 1.0 release is so that we can start working on 2.0. But again here, don’t get too excited! Cap’n Proto 2.0 is not slated to be a revolutionary change. Rather, there are a number of changes we (the Cloudflare Workers team) would like to make to Cap’n Proto’s C++ API, and its companion, the KJ C++ toolkit library. Over the ten years these libraries have been available, I have kept their APIs pretty stable, despite being 0.x versioned. But for 2.0, we want to make some sweeping backwards-incompatible changes, in order to fix some footguns and improve developer experience for those on our team.</p>
<p>Some users probably won’t want to keep up with these changes. Hence, I’m releasing 1.0 now as a sort of “long-term support” release. We’ll backport bugfixes as appropriate to the 1.0 branch for the long term, so that people who aren’t interested in changes can just stick with it.</p>
<h2 id="whats-actually-new-in-10">What’s actually new in 1.0?</h2>
<p>Again, not a whole lot has changed since the last version, 0.10. But there are a few things worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A number of optimizations were made to improve performance of Cap’n Proto RPC. These include reducing the amount of memory allocation done by the RPC implementation and KJ I/O framework, adding the ability to elide certain messages from the RPC protocol to reduce traffic, and doing better buffering of small messages that are sent and received together to reduce syscalls. These are incremental improvements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Breaking change:</strong> Previously, servers could opt into allowing RPC cancellation by calling <code>context.allowCancellation()</code> after a call was delivered. In 1.0, opting into cancellation is instead accomplished using an annotation on the schema (the <code>allowCancellation</code> annotation defined in <code>c++.capnp</code>). We made this change after observing that in practice, we almost always wanted to allow cancellation, but we almost always forgot to do so. The schema-level annotation can be set on a whole file at a time, which is easier not to forget. Moreover, the dynamic opt-in required a lot of bookkeeping that had a noticeable performance impact in practice; switching to the annotation provided a performance boost. For users that never used <code>context.allowCancellation()</code> in the first place, there’s no need to change anything when upgrading to 1.0 – cancellation is still disallowed by default. (If you are affected, you will see a compile error. If there’s no compile error, you have nothing to worry about.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KJ now uses <code>kqueue()</code> to handle asynchronous I/O on systems that have it (MacOS and BSD derivatives). KJ has historically always used <code>epoll</code> on Linux, but until now had used a slower <code>poll()</code>-based approach on other Unix-like platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KJ’s HTTP client and server implementations now support the <code>CONNECT</code> method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/pull/1700">A new class <code>capnp::RevocableServer</code> was introduced</a> to assist in exporting RPC wrappers around objects whose lifetimes are not controlled by the wrapper. Previously, avoiding use-after-free bugs in such scenarios was tricky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many, many smaller bug fixes and improvements. <a href="https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">See the PR history</a> for details.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-planned-for-20">What’s planned for 2.0?</h2>
<p>The changes we have in mind for version 2.0 of Cap’n Proto’s C++ implementation are mostly NOT related to the protocol itself, but rather to the C++ API and especially to KJ, the C++ toolkit library that comes with Cap’n Proto. These changes are motivated by our experience building a large codebase on top of KJ: namely, the Cloudflare Workers runtime, <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd"><code>workerd</code></a>.</p>
<p>KJ is a C++ toolkit library, arguably comparable to things like Boost, Google’s Abseil, or Facebook’s Folly. I started building KJ at the same time as Cap’n Proto in 2013, at a time when C++11 was very new and most libraries were not really designing around it yet. The intent was never to create a new standard library, but rather to address specific needs I had at the time. But over many years, I ended up building a lot of stuff. By the time I joined Cloudflare and started the Workers Runtime, KJ already featured a powerful async I/O framework, HTTP implementation, TLS bindings, and more.</p>
<p>Of course, KJ has nowhere near as much stuff as Boost or Abseil, and nowhere near as much engineering effort behind it. You might argue, therefore, that it would have been better to choose one of those libraries to build on. However, KJ had a huge advantage: that we own it, and can shape it to fit our specific needs, without having to fight with anyone to get those changes upstreamed.</p>
<p>One example among many: KJ’s HTTP implementation features the ability to “suspend” the state of an HTTP connection, after receiving headers, and transfer it to a different thread or process to be resumed. This is an unusual thing to want, but is something we needed for resource management in the Workers Runtime. Implementing this required some deep surgery in KJ HTTP and definitely adds complexity. If we had been using someone else’s HTTP library, would they have let us upstream such a change?</p>
<p>That said, even though we own KJ, we’ve still tried to avoid making any change that breaks third-party users, and this has held back some changes that would probably benefit Cloudflare Workers. We have therefore decided to “fork” it. Version 2.0 is that fork.</p>
<p>Development of version 2.0 will take place on Cap’n Proto’s new <code>v2</code> branch. The <code>master</code> branch will become the 1.0 LTS branch, so that existing projects which track <code>master</code> are not disrupted by our changes.</p>
<p>We don’t yet know all the changes we want to make as we’ve only just started thinking seriously about it. But, here’s some ideas we’ve had so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We will require a compiler with support for C++20, or maybe even C++23. Cap’n Proto 1.0 only requires C++14.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In particular, we will require a compiler that supports C++20 coroutines, as lots of KJ async code will be refactored to rely on coroutines. This should both make the code clearer and improve performance by reducing memory allocations. However, coroutine support is still spotty – as of this writing, GCC seems to ICE on KJ’s coroutine implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cap’n Proto’s RPC API, KJ’s HTTP APIs, and others are likely to be revised to make them more coroutine-friendly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>kj::Maybe</code> will become more ergonomic. It will no longer overload <code>nullptr</code> to represent the absence of a value; we will introduce <code>kj::none</code> instead. <code>KJ_IF_MAYBE</code> will no longer produce a pointer, but instead a reference (a trick that becomes possible by utilizing C++17 features).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will drop support for compiling with exceptions disabled. KJ’s coding style uses exceptions as a form of software fault isolation, or “catchable panics”, such that errors can cause the “current task” to fail out without disrupting other tasks running concurrently. In practice, this ends up affecting every part of how KJ-style code is written. And yet, since the beginning, KJ and Cap’n Proto have been designed to accommodate environments where exceptions are turned off at compile time, using an elaborate system to fall back to callbacks and distinguish between fatal and non-fatal exceptions. In practice, maintaining this ability has been a drag on development – no-exceptions mode is constantly broken and must be tediously fixed before each release. Even when the tests are passing, it’s likely that a lot of KJ’s functionality realistically cannot be used in no-exceptions mode due to bugs and fragility. Today, I would strongly recommend against anyone using this mode except maybe for the most basic use of Cap’n Proto’s serialization layer. Meanwhile, though, I’m honestly not sure if anyone uses this mode at all! In theory I would expect many people do, since many people choose to use C++ with exceptions disabled, but I’ve never actually received a single question or bug report related to it. It seems very likely that this was wasted effort all along. By removing support, we can simplify a lot of stuff and probably do releases more frequently going forward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, we’ll drop support for no-RTTI mode and other exotic modes that are a maintenance burden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may revise KJ’s approach to reference counting, as the current design has proven to be unintuitive to many users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will fix a longstanding design flaw in <code>kj::AsyncOutputStream</code>, where EOF is currently signaled by destroying the stream. Instead, we’ll add an explicit <code>end()</code> method that returns a Promise. Destroying the stream without calling <code>end()</code> will signal an erroneous disconnect. (There are several other aesthetic improvements I’d like to make to the KJ stream APIs as well.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may want to redesign several core I/O APIs to be a better fit for Linux’s new-ish io_uring event notification paradigm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The RPC implementation may switch to allowing cancellation by default. As discussed above, this is opt-in today, but in practice I find it’s almost always desirable, and disallowing it can lead to subtle problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And so on.</p>
</li>

<p>It’s worth noting that at present, there is no plan to make any backwards-incompatible changes to the serialization format or RPC protocol. The changes being discussed only affect the C++ API. Applications written in other languages are completely unaffected by all this.</p>
<p>It’s likely that a formal 2.0 release will not happen for some time – probably a few years. I want to make sure we get through all the really big breaking changes we want to make, before we inflict update pain on most users. Of course, if you’re willing to accept breakages, you can always track the <code>v2</code> branch. Cloudflare Workers releases from <code>v2</code> twice a week, so it should always be in good working order.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span>Credit: Louis Freedberg / EdSource</span></p><p><span>The California Department of Education building in Sacramento.</span></p></div><div><p><img src="https://edsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Cali-DofE.jpg"><span>Credit: Louis Freedberg / EdSource</span></p><p><span>The California Department of Education building in Sacramento.</span></p></div><p><span>The California Department of Education has threatened to sue two prominent Stanford University education professors to prevent them from testifying in a lawsuit against the department — actions the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California calls an attempt to muzzle them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The ACLU, in turn, is threatening a lawsuit of its own — against CDE for infringing their and other researchers’ First Amendment rights.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Observers say the dispute has the potential to limit who conducts education research in California and what they are able to study because CDE controls the sharing of data that is not available to the public.</span></p>
<p><span>At issue is a restriction that CDE requires researchers to sign as a condition for their gaining access to nonpublic K-12 data. The clause, which CDE is interpreting broadly, prohibits the researcher from participating in any litigation against the department, even in cases unrelated to the research they were doing through CDE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“It keeps education researchers from weighing in on the side of parties who are adverse to the California Department of Education. So it’s really skewing the information and expertise that can come into courts,” said Alyssa Morones, an ACLU attorney involved with the case. “Individuals and students seeking to vindicate their rights no longer will have access to these education experts, and the court can no longer hear what they have to say.”</span></p>
<h3><b>Court brief: State failed to lead academic recovery</b></h3>
<p><span>Professors Sean Reardon and Thomas Dee had signed separate and unrelated data-partnership agreements with the department, and both were asked by attorneys in an ongoing lawsuit, </span><a href="https://publiccounsel.org/litigation/cayla-j-v-california/"><span>Cayla J. v. State of California</span></a><span>, to testify on behalf of students filing the case. The lawsuit, against the California Department of Education, the State Board of Education and State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, charges the state</span><span> with failing to prevent the deep learning loss imposed by the pandemic </span><span>on low-income students and other high-needs students.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Reardon, who had co-authored </span><a href="https://educationrecoveryscorecard.org/"><span>landmark nationwide research on pandemic learning,</span></a><span> said he would have considere</span><span>d providing expert testimony. </span><span>But warned this month by CDE that he’d be breaching his contract, Reardon declined — even though his learning loss research </span><span>did not involve the data obtained through his agreement with CDE.</span></p>

<p><span>Dee, a professor at the Graduate School of Education at Stanford, agreed to serve as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in the Cayla J. case on the effects of Covid-19 on enrollment, chronic absenteeism and student engagement in California. This month, he was one of a half-dozen nationally prominent education professors who filed briefs in the case.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In it, Dee cited data on enrollment declines and chronic absenteeism. He concluded, “Because of both its comprehensive data systems and its powerful fiscal and operational capacities, the state of California is in a unique position to provide leadership in better understanding and meeting the serious challenges of academic recovery. However, to date, the state has not clearly demonstrated such leadership, instead emphasizing responses by local school districts.”</span></p>
<p><span>CDE moved against Dee even though the data contract he had signed on behalf of a Stanford program was for research unrelated to the Cayla J. case.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On Feb.24, after CDE discovered that Dee had filed the brief, the department warned Dee that he had violated the contract he had signed in February 2022 as the chief investigator for the </span><a href="https://gardnercenter.stanford.edu/"><span>John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities</span></a><span> at Stanford. As a result, the letter said, CDE was suspending the data partnership and demanding that Dee “mitigate further damage.” The department would consider seeking an injunction to prevent him from participating in the Cayla J. case along with a $50,000 fine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Also, be aware,” wrote Cindy Kazanis, the director of CDE’s Analysis, Measurement, and Accountability Reporting Division, “that your actions have adversely impacted your working relationship with CDE, and your response to this letter is critically important to existing and future collaborations between us.” The letter was copied to Stanford.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The contract that Dee signed with CDE is </span><span>to examine how the California School Dashboard was affecting alternative schools serving those at risk of dropping out and those with motivation and behavior issues. He said he signed the contract in his capacity as faculty director of the Gardner Center, but had not actually looked at any of the data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Dee said he relied on publicly available data in writing his brief for the Cayla J. case. He declined to comment further on the case.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The dispute is now in the courts. The plaintiffs’ attorneys in Cayla J., the public interest law firm Public Counsel and Morrison and Foerster, a San Francisco-based law firm doing pro bono work, </span><span>are asking a Superior Court judge to allow Dee’s participation in this case and protect him from CDE’s penalties — but only in this particular lawsuit. A hearing is scheduled early next week in Alameda Superior Court.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The ACLU </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23889016-cde-aclu-tomdee-motion-072723"><span>filed a brief on Feb. 27 supporting Dee’s participation in the Cayla J. case</span></a><span>. But meanwhile, it took the first steps </span><span>toward </span><span>a larger lawsuit to eliminate CDE’s litigation prohibition.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>‘What are state officials afraid of?’</b></h3>
<p><span>Michael Jacobs, an attorney with Morrison and Foerster, said he was disappointed that the state would attempt to block education experts from giving their expertise. “The futures of the least advantaged schoolchildren in California are at issue. The data these experts utilized are all public.”</span></p>
<p><span>“What are state officials afraid of?” Jacobs said. “That their performance in running the school system during the pandemic in fact aggravated the achievement gap? That notwithstanding their protestations, they haven’t done enough to address that problem?”</span></p>
<p><span>CDE declined to comment on the need for the litigation ban in data contracts or its threats and actions against Dee or Reardon. Researchers told EdSource they were unaware of similar prohibitions in other states, but EdSource could not verify that.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In a</span><a href="https://edsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ACLU-CDE-EdResearch-let-070723.pdf"> <span>July 7 letter</span></a><span>, the ACLU gave the department 10 days to expunge the restriction from all contracts with researchers. In a one-sentence defense a week later, Len Garfinkel, general counsel for CDE, stated, ”In our view, the Department’s data protection agreements are compliant with law.”</span></p>
<p><span>ACLU hasn’t revealed when it might take its next step.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>ACLU’s focus was a separate five-year research contract that the department signed in 2018 and updated in 2020 with the Learning Policy Institute, a Palo Alto-based nonprofit education research organization.</span></p>
<p><span>The next-to-the-last clause in the 11-page document, titled “Interests adverse to the California Department of Education,” states that as long as the contract is in effect, “</span><span>LPI’s employees, executives, and other representatives shall not voluntarily testify for, consult with, or advise a party in conjunction with any mediation, arbitration, litigation, or other similar legal proceeding where LPI knows that party is adverse to the CDE, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction or the State Board of Education.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, if anyone covered by the contract does become involved in litigation, CDE can immediately revoke the contract and demand all the data be returned or destroyed. LPI and signers of the agreement would be subject to a fine. That’s the same wording as in Dee’s contract through the Gardner Center.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Linda Darling-Hammond among contract signers</b></h3>
<p><span>Reardon, professor of poverty and inequality in education at the Stanford Graduate School of Education as well as a senior research fellow at LPI, signed that contract, along with 15 others, mainly LPI employees and researchers. Signing as the principal investigator was Linda Darling-Hammond, LPI’s president and CEO. She also is the president of the state board and an adviser to Gov. Gavin Newsom. She signed the original agreement a year before Newsom nominated her to the state board.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The ACLU, acting on its own, asserted the provision is clearly unconstitutional. A government can set restrictions for granting access to nonpublic data for research purposes, but not to limit a researcher’s First Amendment right of free speech, it said in its </span><a href="https://edsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ACLU-CDE-EdResearch-let-070723.pdf"><span>nine-page letter </span></a><span>to the department.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s “even ‘more blatant and more egregious,’” the ACLU wrote, citing a</span><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2014/13-502"> <span>2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision</span></a><span>,</span><span> is the department’s “viewpoint discrimination.” The contract doesn’t ban an education researcher from testifying </span><i><span>for</span></i><span> the department in a lawsuit; it just can’t testify </span><i><span>against</span></i><span> it.</span></p>
<p><span>“Viewpoint discrimination is poison to a free society,”&nbsp; U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito wrote in</span><a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1672/iancu-v-brunetti"> <span>a different high court opinion in a 2019</span></a><span> case that the ACLU also cited in its letter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Morones, who wrote the ACLU letter, said the prohibition is far more broad than the government needs to protect its data. As shown by the department’s response in the Cayla J. lawsuit, the department could apply the provision to thwart LPI and anyone who signed the contract from participating in any litigation against the department, the state board and the state superintendent, Thurmond, she said.</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><a href="https://educationrecoveryscorecard.org/"><span>Education Recovery Scorecard</span></a><span>,</span><span> the learning loss research that Reardon co-authored, relies on publicly available data from California and 39 other states, and, Reardon said, does not use any data provided to the LPI for its research project. Reardon’s project with LPI&nbsp; is focused on the pre-pandemic success of English learners in California from 2006 to 20-19.</span></p>
<h3><b>Researchers rely on partnership agreements</b></h3>
<p><span>Researchers seek agreements with the department to access nonpublic data, especially student-level data that detail the demographic information and the performance records over time of California’s 5.8 million students but without any names or identifying information. That data is the gold standard for accurate research. A partnership contract details the department’s commitments and researchers’ responsibilities, including strong assurances they will have security protections in place to protect students’ privacy and anonymity.</span></p>
<p><span>The dispute does not involve the disclosure of any student-level information.</span></p>
<p><span>Maria Clayton, the director of communications for CDE,</span> <span>said the agreement “is standard language that CDE has used for years in these types of data-sharing agreements.” </span></p>
<p><span>Reardon said in an email, “It’s perfectly appropriate – even necessary – that CDE or any state agency ensure student privacy and factual correctness when the state’s data is used by external researchers. It is unclear to me, however, how restricting researchers’ freedom to testify in a lawsuit, even an unrelated one, serves the interests of California’s students.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“The restriction does not make research better,” he added,&nbsp; “and does nothing that I can see to protect student privacy. It may limit which researchers are willing or able to work with the state, leaving the state without access to some of the best researchers; and it may limit the effectiveness of litigation that might benefit California’s students.”</span></p>
<h3><b>No restrictions on what researchers can publish</b></h3>
<p><span>The contract does not impose any restrictions on researchers’ ability to independently report what they learn from the data.</span></p>
<p><span>Patrick Shields, the executive director of LPI, said the department doesn’t interfere in how researchers report on their findings. And since LPI is a research organization that does not engage in litigation, it is not affected by the restriction not to testify against the state.</span></p>
<p><span>“We don’t feel restrictions on portraying data as it is. There have been no internal discussions (with the department) that we can’t say this or that,” he said.&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But researchers seek access to analyze data without knowing what they will discover. LPI’s contract with the department, which it calls the California Equity Project, covers a range of topics that have already generated and will produce dozens of studies on teacher shortages, teacher and administrator professional development, homeless students, English learners, foster youths and K-12 achievement and funding gaps.</span></p>
<p><span>Studies using a wide swath of data could lead to legislation, or it could also prompt advocacy organizations like Public Counsel and the ACLU to pursue remedies through the courts </span><span>to fix flaws in state laws or address poor student performance or inequities in funding.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>ACLU argues that </span><span>preventing researchers from</span> <span>sharing their expertise with the plaintiffs would be prior restraint and deny</span> <span>the public a full and fair presentation of the issues</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>For this and other reasons, David Plank, the retired executive of Policy Analysis for California Education or PACE, a collaborative research and policy organization based at Stanford and several other universities, said he “would never have signed a contract in which we agreed to protect the interests or reputation of the agency with which we would have signed.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Worldcoin — a new financial system connected to sensitive biometric information,<a node="[object Object]" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1048981/worldcoin-cryptocurrency-biometrics-web3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> mostly harvested from poor people</a> — sure <em>sounds</em> like a terrible idea.</p>
<p>“Terrible” doesn’t do it justice.</p>
<p>Worldcoin will need to assemble a vast database of iris data. But not everyone is eager to gaze into an Orb. In the bootstrapping phase, at least, you had to pay people to scan their eyes. And so Worldcoin turned to the global south — home to the cheapest eyeballs — and played a dark game of ‘what will people do for money?’</p>
<p>Incredibly, <a node="[object Object]" href="https://www.theblock.co/post/237647/inside-sam-altmans-worldcoin-and-its-quest-to-catalog-all-humans" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Worldcoin was unprepared</a> for an obvious consequence of this rollout strategy: A black market for verified credentials. You can now seemingly <a node="[object Object]" href="https://twitter.com/BlockBeatsAsia/status/1659060950748782594?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">buy a World ID</a> for as little as $30. Anyone, then, with more than $30 on hand can command more than one digital identity (although Worldcoin is <a node="[object Object]" href="https://gizmodo.com/worldcoin-black-market-iris-data-identity-orb-1850454037" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">aware of this issue</a> and has proposed solutions to resolve it). Connecting real people to digital identities is a thorny puzzle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worldcoin does not fix this. And it’s unlikely it ever can, since nothing in the design can stop professional sybil attackers farming eyeballs on the ground level through nefarious means.</p>
<p>This does not inspire trust in the system or its designers. And yet trust is what they demand. Worldcoin’s promotional materials are <a node="[object Object]" href="https://worldcoin.org/faqs#data-privacy-&amp;-security" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">full of promises</a> — to delete sensitive biometric information, or keep it hidden from view, or not use it in nefarious ways. One blog post (quoted <a node="[object Object]" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1048981/worldcoin-cryptocurrency-biometrics-web3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>; the original appears to have been changed since initial release) put it this way: “During our field-testing phase, we are collecting and securely storing more data than we will upon its completion… We will delete all the biometric data we have collected during field testing once our algorithms are fully-trained.”</p>
<p>“Trust us,” in other words. “We’ll totally delete the eyeball database.”</p>
<p>But when it comes to sensitive information, promises aren’t enough. And the very people who insist that you trust them are the ones who should command the most suspicion. The fact that Worldcoin’s co-founder Sam Altman also heads up OpenAI — a firm currently <a node="[object Object]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/05/authors-file-a-lawsuit-against-openai-for-unlawfully-ingesting-their-books" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">being sued</a> over allegations of dubious uses of large data sets — asks more questions than it answers.</p>
<p>Sometimes Worldcoin’s privacy promises are conjoined with dazzling technical details. Zero-knowledge proofs, we’re told, will save the day, and allow users to prove humanity without connecting any particular financial activity to a World ID or other associated transactions.</p>
<p>There’s a grain of truth here. Zero-knowledge proofs can generate impressive privacy guarantees. But in the case of Worldcoin marketing, they’re more theater than substance. Taking off your shoes at the airport makes it look like important precautions are being taken (but doesn’t actually make you any safer); and <a node="[object Object]" href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/developers/privacy-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">long blog posts about zero-knowledge proofs</a> distract from, but don’t in fact address, the problem of Worldcoin asking for users’ trust.</p>
<p>Linking immutable biometric traits to money could have dystopian consequences.</p>
<p>Imagine that your digital identity has been lost in some way — shut down by authorities for non-compliance, or otherwise blocked. With traditional cash — and other cryptocurrencies — you can always make a new wallet and stash some fresh coins in it. But this isn’t <em>Minority Report, </em>and you can’t get a new iris from your neighborhood surgeon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When your immutable digital identity is locked — imagine merchants who won’t take your coins from you without a digital signature announcing your World ID — it’s over for you. No old account. No new account. No soup for you. You just lost your digital personhood.</p>
<p>Boosters might reply that, thanks to zero-knowledge proofs, one <em>could</em> prove that a given transaction is associated with a valid World ID without disclosing which World ID that is — thus reducing the risk of total identity blockade. But this reply misses the point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zero-knowledge proofs <em>could</em> be used in benign ways or to preserve user privacy. Or authorities could demand more; they could demand that users reveal all, or be locked out altogether. Setting up a system and simply hoping its full powers of surveillance and control won’t be used is naive, at best.</p>
<h2 id="dystopian-premise-dystopian-premine">Dystopian premise… dystopian premine?</h2>
<p>Worldcoin is billed as a network “<a node="[object Object]" href="https://worldcoin.org/cofounder-letter" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">owned by everyone</a>.” Early promotional materials claim giving “<a node="[object Object]" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/worldcoin#toggle-gdpr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">every person on the planet an equal share of a new cryptocurrency</a>” as a premise of the project. It sounds laudable. But a glance at the actual plan for distributing tokens casts doubt on whether equal distribution is an aim of the project at all, much less one it will achieve.</p>
<p>It’s a curious ‘world’ coin that <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/worldcoin-not-in-us">isn’t even available</a> in the <a node="[object Object]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-16/worldcoin-the-eyeball-scanning-crypto-unicorn-hits-signup-snags" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">United States, Turkey, Sudan, or China</a>. And if equal distribution is a goal, allocating a significant chunk <a node="[object Object]" href="https://whitepaper.worldcoin.org/tokenomics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">of all the tokens that will ever exist to insiders</a> is another curious choice. Early documentation put that insider number at twenty percent; it’s now slated to be at least twenty-five.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who are these insiders? It’s some combination of Worldcoin developers and their partners, Orb operators (with signup bonuses that exhibit a <a node="[object Object]" href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1452065666824028160" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pyramid-like structure</a>), and a <a node="[object Object]" href="https://venturebeat.com/consumer/worldcoin-launches-a-global-cryptocurrency-that-will-be-given-to-every-person-on-earth/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">slate of (in)famous investors</a> including Sam Bankman-Fried and Three Arrows Capital. Such self-dealing is not the plan one would expect, to put the point mildly, from an operation with genuine egalitarian ambitions.</p>
<p><strong>Read more from our opinion section:</strong> <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/worldcoin-eyeballs-scan-brooklyn">Worldcoin hackable by cutting off someone’s face, draping it over your own</a></p>
<p>Now that Worldcoin has launched, we know a bit more about how token distribution will work. It is not entirely reassuring.</p>
<p>There’s a well-known crypto trick; they call it a “Sam Coin” (yes, after <a href="https://blockworks.co/tag/sam-bankman-fried">that Sam</a>). The idea is to release into circulation a very small percentage of all the tokens that will ever exist. Despite low liquidity and trading volume, some eye-popping fully diluted market cap numbers can result, which make for great marketing and creative accounting.</p>
<p>Worldcoin — much like MAPS, a <a node="[object Object]" href="https://twitter.com/DrNickA/status/1588132362847748096" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">notorious crypto dud</a> — <a node="[object Object]" href="https://twitter.com/DrNickA/status/1683404751164022786" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">is a Sam Coin</a>.</p>
<p>About one percent of the ten billion Worldcoin tokens that will ever exist are in circulation, <a node="[object Object]" href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/24/worldcoin-release-tokenomics-report-geofenced-for-some-countries/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mostly in the hands of market makers partnered with Worldcoin</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yet Worldcoin’s fully diluted market cap, at the time of writing, is somewhere around twenty billion dollars. It’s a great setup to attract speculative retail investors. And those market maker insiders, furthermore, have a deal that guarantees them <a node="[object Object]" href="https://twitter.com/MomoOnChain/status/1683395484738527233" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">access to tokens at a fixed price</a>. Their profits are secure. The result is a market structure <a node="[object Object]" href="https://twitter.com/AriDavidPaul/status/1683627646633013249" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">primed for manipulation and pump and dump dynamics</a> — familiar to anyone who’s paid much attention to crypto.</p>
<p>Worldcoin is no radical new financial system, and certainly not one aimed at equality or fairness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s just more of the same, but with extra data harvesting steps.</p>
<p>Do not look into the Orb.</p>

<li><em>Shipments declined YoY for the third consecutive quarter amid weak consumer demand.</em></li>
<li><em>Android smartphone shipments declined 38% while Apple shipments fell 6% YoY.</em></li>
<li><em>Consumers hesitated to purchase smartphones amid economic uncertainty.</em></li>
<li><em>Google and Motorola launched new foldable models during the quarter.</em></li>
<li><em>Low smartphone upgrade rates are likely to persist in Q3 2023.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Denver, Boston, Toronto, London, New Delhi, Hong Kong, Beijing, Taipei, Seoul – July 28, 2023</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/us-market-smartphone-share/">US</a> smartphone shipments declined 24% YoY in Q2 2023, according to Counterpoint Research’s <strong>Market Monitor</strong> data. This was the third consecutive quarter of YoY declines. Android brands like Samsung, Motorola and TCL-Alcatel saw the steepest declines in shipments, while Apple’s shipments were more resilient. As a result, Apple’s share of shipments increased YoY.</p>
<p><strong>US Smartphone Shipment Share by&nbsp;</strong><strong>OEM</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/US-Smartphone-Shipment-Share-by-OEM-2-1024x520.png" alt="US smartphone shipments share by OEM" width="1000" height="508" srcset="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/US-Smartphone-Shipment-Share-by-OEM-2-1024x520.png 1024w, https://www.counterpointresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/US-Smartphone-Shipment-Share-by-OEM-2-300x152.png 300w, https://www.counterpointresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/US-Smartphone-Shipment-Share-by-OEM-2-768x390.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>Commenting on the decline in <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/top-5-smartphone-model-share-8-countries/">smartphone</a> shipments, <strong>Research Analyst Matthew Orf </strong>said, “Consumer demand for smartphones was tepid in Q2 2023, with the summer slump in sales coming early. Despite inflation numbers falling through the quarter and ongoing strength in the job market, consumers hesitated to upgrade their devices amid market uncertainty. We expect this trend to continue through Q3 2023, but the expectations from the upcoming iPhone 15 remain bullish.”</p>
<p>Despite the overall drop in shipments, certain segments of the US smartphone market saw important signs of life in the quarter. <strong>Senior Research Analyst</strong> <strong>Maurice Klaehne</strong> said, “In spite of declining smartphone shipments, the foldable market reached important milestones in the quarter. <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/motorola-us-3-smartphone-oem-2021/">Motorola</a> launched the Razr+, its first foldable device in the US since 2021, and <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/japan-surpasses-us-to-become-biggest-contributor-to-googles-smartphone-shipments/">Google</a> launched its first-ever foldable, the Pixel Fold, providing alternatives to the Samsung Galaxy <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-z-flip-3-foldable-experiences-at-affordable-price/">foldables</a>. With new Galaxy Z Flip and Z Fold devices coming from Samsung in Q3 2023, <strong>foldable shipments could reach their highest level ever in the US in Q3 2023.</strong>”</p>
<p><strong>Associate Research Director Hanish Bhatia </strong>noted, “Despite fewer shipments from Apple compared to the same quarter last year, the brand’s share of shipments was still up 10% YoY. Apple’s resilience was driven by strong promotions across postpaid and prepaid. Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile continued to offer $800+ promo credits for the iPhone 14 while old-generation iPhones were also steeply discounted across prepaid. We are seeing no weakness in the overall promotional activity. In fact, we observed new highs for trade-in credit with Verizon offering up to $1,100 for the Pixel Fold. Google’s Pixel also grew from a small base and launched its old-generation <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/google-pixel-6a-review-tensor-ai-ml/">Pixel 6a</a> in the prepaid channel for the first time to compete with the iPhone 11. Both devices were heavily subsidized in prepaid channels.”</p>
<p><strong>Director of North America Research Jeff Fieldhack</strong> said, “AT&amp;T and T-Mobile reported positive net adds, but Verizon reported negative net adds within its consumer segment for the second consecutive quarter. The net-add activity remains comparable to last year, but the upgrade rates have been lower, causing overall weakness in demand. Near-record low churn has also had a dampening effect on new device sales. Weakness is likely to continue through the start of Q3 2023, but stronger iPhone 15 demand could offset weakness across Android.”</p>

The Electronic Frontier Foundation will award Alexandra Elbakyan, founder of the 'pirate' library Sci-Hub, for her efforts to provide access to scientific knowledge. According to EFF, Elbakyan's site is a vital resource for millions of students and researchers. Some medical professionals have even argued that the site helped to save lives.
</p>
</div><div>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/sci-hub1.png" alt="Sci-Hub" width="225" height="281" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20225%20281'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/sci-hub1.png">There are thousands of pirate sites on the Internet but only a few will receive a permanent entry in the history books. That includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub">Sci-Hub</a>. </p>
<p>Founded by Kazakhstani computer programmer Alexandria Elbakyan, the shadow library provides free access to millions of academic publications. As such, it’s an essential tool for less privileged students and researchers around the world. </p>
<h2>Tearing Down Paywalls Since 2011</h2>
<p>Without Sci-Hub, many academics would be unable to complete their research projects. This all comes at the detriment of the profits of major publishers, but many argue that’s an easy tradeoff to make. </p>
<p>Alexandra knows this from experience. She started Sci-Hub after running into accessibility problems more than a decade ago while studying at a less fortunate university.</p>
<p>“When I was working on my research project, I found out that all research papers I needed for work were paywalled. I was a student in Kazakhstan at the time and our university was not subscribed to anything,” Alexandra <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/sci-hub-tears-down-academias-illegal-copyright-paywalls-150627/">told</a> TorrentFreak years ago.</p>
<p>Today, Sci-Hub continues to tear down academic paywalls but that comes at a cost. Sci-Hub has been sued several times and owes millions in damages to major publishers. In addition, Elbakyan also drew the attention of the FBI. </p>
<p>Instead of throwing in the towel, Sci-Hub’s founder continues to defend her ideals. They’re a thorn in the side of major publishers, but on the other side of the debate, Elbakyan reaps praise. </p>
<h2>EFF Award</h2>
<p>This week, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/electronic-frontier-foundation-present-annual-eff-awards-alexandra-asanovna-elbakyan">announced</a> that Sci-Hub’s founder will receive an award for her accomplishments in advancing access to scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>EFF’s awards are presented to people who have taken a leading role in the fight for freedom and innovation online. The previous winners include Internet pioneer Vint Cerf, Linux creator Linus Torvalds, and whistleblower Chelsea Manning.</p>
<center><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/alexandra-1-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="292" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20292'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/alexandra-1-scaled.jpg"></center>
<p>According to EFF, Elbakyan deserves the award as her life’s work enables millions of people to access scientific knowledge that would otherwise exist beyond their financial reach.</p>
<p>“Sci-Hub is used by millions of students, researchers, medical professionals, journalists, inventors, and curious people all over the world, many of whom provide feedback saying they are grateful for this access to knowledge.</p>
<p>“Some medical professionals have said Sci-Hub helps save human lives; some students have said they wouldn’t be able to complete their education without Sci-Hub’s help,” EFF adds.</p>
<h2>The Real Threat?</h2>
<p>EFF also highlights that Elbakyan’s work helps to challenge the current academic publishing system, where researchers are used as unpaid workhorses. </p>
<p>“Through Sci-Hub, Elbakyan has strived to shatter academic publishing’s monopoly-like mechanisms in which publishers charge high prices even though authors of articles in academic journals receive no payment,” EFF writes. </p>
<p>Elbakyan previously said that academic publishers are the <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/sci-hub-founder-academic-publishers-are-the-real-threat-to-science-not-sci-hub/">real threat</a> to the progress of science as they keep scientific progress and findings behind closed doors, instead of sharing knowledge freely as Sci-Hub does. </p>
<center><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/effaward.jpg" alt="eff award" width="600" height="458" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/effaward.jpg 1169w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/effaward-300x229.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20458'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/effaward.jpg 1169w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/effaward-300x229.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/effaward.jpg"></center>
<p>In addition to Elbakyan, the digital rights group will also present awards to the <a href="https://libraryfreedom.org/">Library Freedom Project</a> and the <a href="https://signalfoundation.org/en/">Signal Foundation</a> for their achievements.</p>
<h2>‘I Am Sci-Hub’</h2>
<p>Sci-Hub’s founder is <a href="https://twitter.com/ringo_ring/status/1684630479776145410">pleased</a> with EFF’s acknowledgment, although the initial plan to give the award to the Sci-Hub website, rather than her personally, wasn’t well received. </p>
<p>“It was really disgusting to read they ask me to accept their EFF Pioneer award ‘on behalf of Sci-Hub’,” Elbakyan said in <a href="https://twitter.com/ringo_ring/status/1680064493601304576">response</a> two weeks before the awards were officially announced. </p>
<p>“Why did not they want to give the award to me directly? Sci-Hub is my sole creation; it is not an organization and never had any team. In 1998 they awarded Torvalds, not Linux,” she added.</p>
<p>That commentary apparently made EFF reconsider its plan. The award now goes to Elbakyan directly and it will be officially handed out at the awards ceremony in San Francisco this coming September. </p>
<p>EFF previously recognized that it may be challenging for Sci-Hub’s founder to attend the ceremony in person, noting that there are secure methods of communication available in case she prefers to accept it virtually instead. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Tor” evokes an image of the dark web; a place to hire hitmen or buy drugs that, at this point, is overrun by feds trying to catch you in the act. The reality, however, is a lot more boring than that — but it’s also more secure.</p>
<p>The Onion Router, now called Tor, is a privacy-focused web browser run by a nonprofit group. You can <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.torproject.org/download/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0">download it for free</a> and use it to shop online or browse social media, just like you would on Chrome or Firefox or Safari, but with additional access to unlisted websites ending in .onion. This is what people think of as the “dark web,” because the sites aren’t indexed by search engines. But those sites aren’t an inherently criminal endeavor.</p>
<p>“This is not a hacker tool,” said Pavel Zoneff, director of strategic communications at The Tor Project. “It is a browser just as easy to use as any other browser that people are used to.”</p>
<p>That’s right, despite common misconceptions, Tor can be used for any internet browsing you usually do. The key difference with Tor is that the network hides your IP address and other system information for full anonymity. This may sound familiar, because it’s how a lot of people approach <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-vpn-130004396.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0">VPNs</a>, but the difference is in the details.</p>
<p>VPNs are just encrypted tunnels hiding your traffic from one hop to another. The company behind a VPN can still access your information, sell it or pass it along to law enforcement. With Tor, there’s no link between you and your traffic, according to Jed Crandall, an associate professor at Arizona State University. Tor is built in the “higher layers” of the network and routes your traffic through separate tunnels, instead of a single encrypted tunnel. While the first tunnel may know some personal information and the last one may know the sites you visited, there is virtually nothing connecting those data points because your IP address and other identifying information are bounced from server to server into obscurity.</p>
<p>In simpler terms: using regular browsers directly connects you and your traffic, adding a VPN routes that information through an encrypted tunnel so that your internet service provider can’t see it and Tor scatters your identity and your search traffic until it becomes almost anonymous, and very difficult to identify.</p>
<p>Accessing unindexed websites adds extra perks, like secure communication. While a platform like WhatsApp offers encrypted conversations, there could be traces that the conversation happened left on the device if it’s ever investigated, according to Crandall. Tor's communication tunnels are secure and much harder to trace that the conversation ever happened.</p>
<p>Other use cases may include keeping the identities of sensitive populations like undocumented immigrants anonymous, trying to unionize a workplace without the company shutting it down, victims of domestic violence looking for resources without their abuser finding out or, as Crandall said, wanting to make embarrassing Google searches without related targeted ads following you around forever.</p>
<p>Still, with added layers of security can come some additional hiccups, like lag or longer loading times. That could be true for some users depending on what they do online, but anecdotally it's gotten a lot faster in recent years, and users have said they barely notice a difference compared to other browsers. Sameer Patil, associate professor at the School of Computing at the University of Utah, studied this by having students and staff try out Tor as their main browser. “I was personally very surprised at how many sites and things just work fine in the Tor browser. So not only did they work as intended, but they also were fast enough,” Patil said.</p>
<p>But even if online privacy isn’t your main concern personally, using Tor can help support industries that heavily rely on it. By using the anonymous and secure browser, you’re supporting activists, journalists and everyone else’s privacy because the more people that use it, the more secure it gets, according to Patil. If only certain sensitive groups use it, it’ll be easier to deanonymize and ultimately track down identities. When you’re one in a billion using it, that task becomes nearly impossible.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><span>Everybody knows Stockholm Syndrome, when </span>hostages develop an attachment to their captors. But who knows its two opposites? Lima Syndrome is when the hostage <em>takers</em> start sympathizing with the hostages. And London Syndrome is when hostages become argumentative toward their captors—often with deadly results.</p>
<p>In all, ten cities around the world carry a unique burden: they have a psychological disorder named after them. In <a href="https://ans-names.pitt.edu/ans/article/view/2019/2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an old issue of <em>Names</em></a>, the journal of the American Name Society, Ernest Lawrence Abel listed and described them. He arranged them in three categories: four tourism-related, three linked to hostage situations, and three “other.”</p>

<h3 id="h-jerusalem-syndrome">Jerusalem Syndrome</h3>
<p>First reported in the 1930s, Jerusalem Syndrome affects about 100 visitors every year. Of those, about 40 need to be hospitalized. Symptoms usually recede a few weeks after the visit. Uniquely religious in focus, this syndrome manifests as the delusion that the subject is an important Biblical figure. Previous examples include people who believed they were Mary, Moses, John the Baptist, and even Jesus himself.</p>
<p>Sufferers end up sermoning and shouting on the street, warning passersby of the approach of the end times and the need for redemption. Often obsessed with physical purity, some will shave off all bodily hair, repetitively bathe, or compulsively cut the nails on their fingers and toes.</p>
<p>Jerusalem Syndrome affects mainly Christians, but also Jews, with some obvious differences. For instance: Christians mostly imagine themselves to be characters from the New Testament, while Jews tend to impersonate Old Testament figures.</p>
<h3>Paris Syndrome</h3>
<p>First reported in 2004, this syndrome mainly affects first-time visitors from Japan. On average, 12 cases are reported each year, mostly people in their 30s. Sufferers exhibit symptoms including anxiety, delusions (including the belief that their hotel room has been bugged or that they are Louis XIV, France’s “Sun King”), and hallucinations.</p>
<p>Why does Paris Syndrome mainly affect Japanese tourists? Perhaps it’s jet lag. Or it could be the jarring confrontation of the a priori ideal of Paris as exotic and friendly with the rather more abrasive nature of the city’s inhabitants. Or the high degree of linguistic incomprehension between the Japanese visitors and their Parisian hosts. Perhaps a bit (or rather, a lot) of all those things together.</p>
<p>The problem is important enough for the Japanese Embassy in Paris to maintain a 24-hour hotline, helping affected compatriots find appropriate care. Most patients improve after a few days of resting. Some are so affected that the only known treatment is an immediate return to Japan.</p>
<h3>Florence Syndrome</h3>
<p>First reported in the 1980s and since observed more than 100 times, this syndrome hits mostly Western European tourists between the ages of 20 and 40. American visitors seem less affected. The syndrome is an acute reaction caused by the anticipation and then the experience of the city’s cultural riches. Sufferers are often transported to the hospital straight from Florence’s museums.</p>
<p>Mild symptoms include palpitations, dizziness, fainting, and hallucinations. However, about two-thirds of the affected develop paranoid psychosis. Most sufferers can return home after a few days of bed rest.</p>

<p>This affliction is also known as “<a href="https://bigthink.com/high-culture/stendhal-florence-syndrome-art/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stendhal Syndrome</a>,” after the French author who described the phenomenon during his visit to Florence in 1817. When visiting the Basilica of the Sacred Cross, where Machiavelli, Michelangelo, and Galileo are buried, he “was in a sort of ecstasy… I reached the point where one encounters celestial sensations… I walked with the fear of falling.”</p>
<h3>Venice Syndrome</h3>
<p>Rather more morbid than the previous conditions, Venice Syndrome describes the behavior of people traveling to Venice with the express intention of killing themselves in the city.</p>
<p>Just between 1988 and 1995, 51 foreign visitors were thus diagnosed. The subjects were both male and female, but the largest group came from Germany. Possibly, this is due to the cultural impact of <em>Death in Venice</em>, the novel by German writer Thomas Mann, which was subsequently turned into a film. However, others within the cohort came from the United States, Britain, and France, as well as other countries. In all, 16 succeeded in their suicide mission.</p>
<p>According to research conducted into the phenomenon—mainly by interviewing the 35 survivors—it seemed that “in the collective imagination of romantic people, the association of Venice with decline and decadence was a recurring symbol.”</p>
<h3>Stockholm Syndrome</h3>
<p>Three related city syndromes are linked to hostage situations, the most famous one in the Swedish capital. According to the article in <em>Names</em>, about one in four of those abused, kidnapped, or taken hostage develop an emotional attachment or a sense of loyalty toward their captors or abusers. Some even start to actively cooperate, crossing the line from victim to perpetrator.</p>
<p>This syndrome was first named following a bank robbery turned hostage situation in Stockholm in the summer of 1973. The robbers held four bank employees hostage for six days. The hostages were strapped to dynamite and locked up in a vault. After the negotiated surrender of the robbers, the hostages said they felt more afraid of the police, raised money for the defense of the captors, and refused to testify against them. One of the hostages even became engaged to one of her captors.</p>
<p>In 1974, the newly minted term was used in relation to Patty Hearst. Abducted and abused by the Symbionese Liberation Army, the teenage heiress nevertheless “switched sides,” and eventually helped them rob a bank.</p>
<h3>Lima Syndrome</h3>
<p>Less well known, Lima Syndrome describes the exact opposite of Stockholm Syndrome—that is, the captors develop positive attachments to their hostages. The name refers to a crisis in the Peruvian capital in December 1996, when members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement took 600 guests at the Japanese ambassadorial residence hostage.</p>
<p>The captors became so empathetic toward the guests that they let most of them go within days, including high-value individuals such as the mother of the then-president of Peru. After four months of protracted negotiations, all but one of the hostages were freed. The crisis was resolved following a raid by special forces, in which two hostage takers and one commando died.</p>

<h3>London Syndrome</h3>
<p>London Syndrome is described as the opposite of both Stockholm and Lima Syndromes, in that it involves the development of negative feelings of hostage takers towards their hostages. In fact, London Syndrome most accurately describes a situation whereby hostages provoke their own death at the hand of their captors by annoying, debating, or challenging them, or by trying to escape.</p>
<p>The name comes from the 1981 siege of the Iranian Embassy in London, during which one of the 26 hostages repeatedly argued with his captors, despite the pleading of the others. When the hostage takers decided to kill one of their hostages to further their demands, they shot the argumentative one, throwing his body out into the street.</p>
<p>The execution prompted an armed intervention by police forces, during which more hostages were killed.</p>
<h3>Amsterdam Syndrome</h3>
<p>The three syndromes in the “other” category are only metaphorically related to the city that they are named after.</p>
<p>Amsterdam Syndrome refers to the behavior of men who share pictures of their naked spouses, or of themselves having sex with their spouses, without their consent. The term is believed to reference Amsterdam’s Red Light District, where sex workers are on display behind windows.</p>
<p>This name was coined by a sexologist at the University of La Sapienza in Italy and first publicized at a 2008 conference of the European Federation of Sexology in Rome. At the time of writing the paper, the syndrome had not been properly examined. It was primarily used to describe Italian men, who posted said images on the internet.</p>
<h3>Brooklyn Syndrome</h3>
<p>This term was coined during World War II by Navy psychiatrists, who noticed certain behavioral characteristics and patterns in a segment of the men recruited into military service. At first, these traits were believed to be a psychopathology. Eventually, because they occurred with such frequency, they were recognized as related to the places of origin of the men involved: cities where, due to specific cultural circumstances, the male persona naturally gravitates toward being overly argumentative or personally combative.</p>
<h3>Detroit Syndrome</h3>
<p>Detroit Syndrome is a form of age discrimination in which workers of a certain age are replaced by those who are younger, faster, and stronger, not to mention endowed with new skills better suited for the modern workplace. The syndrome, reported in 2011, gets its name from Detroit, and more specifically from its reputation as a manufacturing hub for automobiles, in which newer models would replace the older ones on a regular basis.</p>

Starting with the release of iOS 17, tvOS 17, watchOS 10 and macOS Sonoma, developers will be required to explain why they're using so-called required reason APIs. Apps failing to provide a valid reason will be rejected started in spring of 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Some APIs... have the potential of being misused to access device signals to try to identify the device or user, also known as fingerprinting. Regardless of whether a user gives your app permission to track, fingerprinting is not allowed," Apple wrote. "To prevent the misuse of certain APIs that can be used to collect data about users’ devices through fingerprinting, you’ll need to declare the reasons for using these APIs in your app’s privacy manifest."</p>
<p>The new rules could increase the rate of app rejections, some developers told <em>9to5Mac</em>. For instance, an API called UserDefaults falls into the "required reason" category, but since it stores user preferences, it's used by a lot of apps. At the same time, it sounds like Apple will basically need to take a developer's word for reason declarations. If those prove to be false, though, it would certainly have a paper trail for any potential penalties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fingerprinting apps can use API calls to retrieve characteristics of your smartphone or PC, including the screen resolution, model, OS and more. It can then take all this information and create a unique "fingerprint," so it can identify you when you go to other apps or websites.</p>
<p>Apple effectively declared war on tracking when it <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-14-5-now-available-170536951.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0">released iOS 14.5 in 2021</a>, requiring developers to ask users' permission before tracking them. Since that feature arrived, only <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-5-users-reject-app-tracking-165309407.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0">4 percent of US iPhone users</a> have agreed to app tracking.

           &quot;module_name&quot;: &quot;Paragraph&quot;,
           &quot;section_header&quot;: &quot;Speaking robot: Our new AI model translates vision and language into robotic actions&quot;
         }"><p data-block-key="m1qhn">For decades, when people have imagined the distant future, they’ve almost always included a starring role for robots. Robots have been cast as dependable, helpful and even charming. Yet across those same decades, the technology has remained elusive — stuck in the imagined realm of science fiction.</p><p data-block-key="dj147">Today, we’re introducing a new advancement in robotics that brings us closer to a future of helpful robots. <a href="https://robotics-transformer2.github.io/">Robotics Transformer 2, or RT-2</a>, is a first-of-its-kind vision-language-action (VLA) model. A <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html">Transformer</a>-based model trained on text and images from the web, RT-2 can directly output robotic actions. Just like language models are trained on text from the web to learn general ideas and concepts, RT-2 transfers knowledge from web data to inform robot behavior.</p><p data-block-key="6rulu">In other words, RT-2 can speak robot.</p><h2 data-block-key="dquo8">The real-world challenges of robot learning</h2><p data-block-key="7uvab">The pursuit of <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/making-robots-more-helpful-with-language/">helpful robots</a> has always been a herculean effort, because a robot capable of doing general tasks in the world needs to be able to handle complex, abstract tasks in highly variable environments — especially ones it's never seen before.</p><p data-block-key="6i5n1">Unlike chatbots, robots need “grounding” in the real world and their abilities. Their training isn’t just about, say, learning everything there is to know about an apple: how it grows, its physical properties, or even that one purportedly landed on Sir Isaac Newton’s head. A robot needs to be able to recognize an apple in context, distinguish it from a red ball, understand what it looks like, and most importantly, know how to pick it up.</p><p data-block-key="5d692">That’s historically required training robots on billions of data points, firsthand, across every single object, environment, task and situation in the physical world — a prospect so time consuming and costly as to make it impractical for innovators. Learning is a challenging endeavor, and even more so for robots.</p><h2 data-block-key="f967p">A new approach with RT-2</h2><p data-block-key="12vlp">Recent work has improved robots’ ability to reason, even enabling them to use <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/05/language-models-perform-reasoning-via.html">chain-of-thought prompting</a>, a way to dissect multi-step problems. The introduction of vision models, like <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/03/palm-e-embodied-multimodal-language.html">PaLM-E</a>, helped robots make better sense of their surroundings. And <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/helping-robots-learn-from-each-other/">RT-1</a> showed that Transformers, known for their ability to generalize information across systems, could even help different types of robots learn from each other.</p><p data-block-key="8qa7i">But until now, robots ran on complex stacks of systems, with high-level reasoning and low-level manipulation systems playing an imperfect game of telephone to operate the robot. Imagine thinking about what you want to do, and then having to tell those actions to the rest of your body to get it to move. RT-2 removes that complexity and enables a single model to not only perform the complex reasoning seen in foundation models, but also output robot actions. Most importantly, it shows that with a small amount of robot training data, the system is able to transfer concepts embedded in its language and vision training data to direct robot actions — even for tasks it’s never been trained to do.</p><p data-block-key="4dl27">For example, if you wanted previous systems to be able to throw away a piece of trash, you would have to explicitly train them to be able to identify trash, as well as pick it up and throw it away. Because RT-2 is able to transfer knowledge from a large corpus of web data, it already has an idea of what trash is and can identify it without explicit training. It even has an idea of how to throw away the trash, even though it’s never been trained to take that action. And think about the abstract nature of trash — what was a bag of chips or a banana peel becomes trash after you eat them. RT-2 is able to make sense of that from its vision-language training data and do the job.</p><h2 data-block-key="f75no">A brighter future for robotics</h2><p data-block-key="esiq6">RT-2’s ability to transfer information to actions shows promise for robots to more rapidly adapt to novel situations and environments. In testing RT-2 models in more than 6,000 robotic trials, the team found that RT-2 functioned as well as our previous model, RT-1, on tasks in its training data, or “seen” tasks. And it almost doubled its performance on novel, unseen scenarios to 62% from RT-1’s 32%.</p><p data-block-key="888en">In other words, with RT-2, robots are able to learn more like we do — transferring learned concepts to new situations.</p><p data-block-key="1atu">Not only does RT-2 show how advances in AI are cascading rapidly into robotics, it shows enormous promise for more general-purpose robots. While there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done to enable helpful robots in human-centered environments, RT-2 shows us an exciting future for robotics just within grasp.</p><p data-block-key="65qo9">Check out the full story on the <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/rt-2-new-model-translates-vision-and-language-into-action?utm_source=keywordblog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=rt2">Google DeepMind Blog</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
<hr>



<p>As a VyOS evangelist, maintainer, and more, I’ve been meaning to write a simple series of “how-to” guides for VyOS for a while.  Sure, there are plenty of guides out there, but I think a lot of them fall short in demonstrating WHY you are entering specific commands.  </p>



<p>VyOS is capable, but it’s much more helpful if you can fully understand what it’s doing.  </p>



<p>This initial guide will walk through the basic setup steps in replacing something like pfSense or some other consumer router with a simple and secure system running VyOS.  </p>



<p>This is also going to be a very very long post, so buckle in!</p>



<hr>





<hr>



<h2><span id="Who_is_this_For">Who is this For</span></h2>



<p>Anybody that wants to use VyOS of course!  </p>



<p>The nice thing about running VyOS is that if you set up it, and understand <strong><em>WHAT</em></strong> it’s doing, then you’ve actually learned something about networking.  </p>



<p>Does something like pfSense work?  </p>



<p>Sure, but it also doesn’t teach you much about what’s actually going on.  And the knowledge learned in VyOS will easily translate to almost any other vendor like Cisco, Arista, and more.  At that point, the concepts are the same, you are just learning the different dialects. </p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="Environment">Environment</span></h2>



<p>VyOS really doesn’t take much in resources.  </p>



<p>8GB of storage and 2-4GB of RAM will be overkill for most basic setups.  </p>



<p>CPU-wise, even small Pentium Silver CPUs can handle gigabit and beyond, even over VPN .  Anything like an i3/i5 or a Xeon won’t break a sweat except in all but the most demanding scenarios.</p>



<p>If you virtualize, it can be helpful to set up a test environment.  This could consist of a simple:</p>



<ul><li>WAN Network.  For testing this could be your existing LAN network.</li><li>A new “LAN” Network. For testing this could just be a separate port group or bridge, and it wouldn’t even need an uplink.</li><li>A simple VM with a GUI (or without), to run some testing. </li></ul>



<p>If virtualization isn’t an option, VyOS can run on almost any device that is x86_64.  I’ve run it on everything from:</p>



<ul><li>NUCs with single NICs and USB/USB-C NICs.</li><li><a href="https://blog.kroy.io/2019/12/08/the-wyse-5070-a-perfect-little-vyos-device/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WYSE 5070/3040 Thin Clients</a>.</li><li>A variety of Dells, including R710s/R620s/R630s.</li><li>Anything Supermicro from 1U to 4U devices.</li></ul>



<p>Finally, for this guide, I’ll be working with two NICs.  </p>



<p>One is a WAN, connected to my current LAN.  I’ll be creating a “network inside a network”.  The second will be our new “LAN”.  This is separate from my existing LAN so I can pretend like it’s a second private network.  These interfaces can be anything:</p>



<ul><li>Physical NICs.</li><li>VLANs.</li><li>Virtual NICs from ESXi, Proxmox, etc.</li></ul>



<hr>



<h2><span id="Install">Install</span></h2>



<p>The first step is to grab yourself a copy of the installer ISO.  </p>



<p>Most people will want the <a href="https://www.vyos.io/rolling-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Release</a>.  You can also build it yourself, via the <a href="https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/contributing/build-vyos.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker image</a>, which is helpful if there are some extra packages you want to add.</p>



<p>If you want access to the LTS version, it requires self-building (an easy process), contributing, or a subscription. I <a href="https://blog.vyos.io/vyos-access-subscriptions-for-documentation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highly recommend contributing</a>, as even writing or cleaning up some documentation will get you access to the LTS prebuilt versions.  </p>



<p>You can also support and get access via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/vyos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patreon</a> or <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/kUa78LT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BuyMeACoffee</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p>Note that for these guides, I will be using a recent version of rolling.  This is important as some configuration nodes have changed locations and format between 1.3+ and the existing LTS versions (DHCP and IPv6 RAs are two things that come to mind).</p>


<div id=""><p>Rolling Stability</p><div><p>
It’s important to note that the rolling releases are generally completely stable.  I would say 95% of them or more are functional without any major bugs.
</p><p>Every once in a while, some broken functionality is pushed, but it is almost always fixed quickly. A broken upgrade is not a show-stopper and it is trivial to boot back into the working version with the built-in <a href="https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/image-mgmt.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Image Management</a>.</p>
<p>I have no issues running rolling releases in many production locations.<br>
</p></div></div>



<h2><span id="Install_Steps">Install Steps</span></h2>



<p>Installation is trivial:</p>



<ul><li>Burn ISO to CD/DVD/USB stick, or boot ISO via remote management (iDrac, iLo, IPMI)</li><li>Login with <code><em>vyos</em></code>/<code><em>vyos</em></code></li><li>Type <code><em>install image</em></code></li><li>Answer the install steps</li><li>Reboot and remove installation media</li></ul>


<div id=""><p>Installation Gotchas</p><div>
<ul>
<li> The installer ISO is a fully functional VyOS image.  That means if you skip the <em>install image</em> step, you can configure the system, and it will work as intended… until you reboot.  Don’t be me.  Make sure to install if you want a permanent installation.
</li><li> Some systems that lack a serial port get stuck on a black screen on the installer ISO.  The simple fix is to edit the grub boot option line and remove the <em>console=ttyS0,115200</em> option from the kernel boot arguments.  Then just boot with <em>CTRL-X</em> as directed.
</li></ul>
</div></div>

<h3><span id="Decision_Time">Decision Time!</span></h3>



<p>Before you go any further, you need to make a decision.  You need to pick out the subnet (or later subnets) where your network will live.  Or, if you are converting over your existing network, just reuse it.</p>



<p>These should be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network">RFC1918 addresses</a>.  You generally want a /24, which is 254 usable addresses.</p>



<p>So, there are three main groups of these private addresses you can choose from:</p>



<ul><li><code>10.X.Y.1-254</code>, where <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are any number between 0 and 255.  For the last number, 0 would be your “network” address, and 255 would be your broadcast address.  You could then assign all your hosts to 1-254.</li><li><code>172.X.Y.1-254</code>, in this case <code>X</code> would be between 16 and 31, and <code>Y</code> could be 0 to 255. </li><li><code>192.168.X.1-254</code>, where <code>X</code> is between 0 and 255.  </li></ul>



<div id=""><p>Subnetting Pro-tips</p><div>
<p>Many routers around the world off-the-shelf use a subnet like 10.0.0.0/24 or 192.168.0.0/24.</p>
<p>
While you can use these subnets, future-you will hate yourself if you ever want to access your network remotely or access other networks when both sides are using the same subnet.
</p>
<p>
I would highly recommend:
</p><ul>
 	<li>Choose a subnet away from the norm.  For example, 10.32.47.0/24.</li>
 	<li>If you want to plan ahead and are planning to break things out on VLANs, use a subnet like 10.32.X.0/24.  That way, in the future, X can represent your VLAN number, and you can do a summary route like 10.32.0.0/16.  I’ll be showing some examples of where this can be used later on in this post.</li></ul>

</div></div>



<hr>



<h3><span id="Configuring_the_LAN_and_Remote_access">Configuring the LAN and Remote access</span></h3>



<p>After the subnet is chosen, the first step is to get the router on the LAN and accessible via SSH.  This makes it much easier to configure, as you are no longer tethered to a keyboard/monitor, VM console, can copy/paste, etc.  </p>



<h4><span id="LAN_IP">LAN IP</span></h4>

<p>Goals:</p>



<ul><li>Enter configure mode</li><li>Add address to the correct interface</li><li>Commit and save</li></ul>

<p>The first step is to enter configure mode.  This allows you to make changes to the system configuration.  Type <code>configure</code>.  VyOS also supports shortcuts and tab completion, so typing <code>conf</code> or <code>conf&lt;TAB&gt;</code> will do the same thing.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="336" height="135" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-5.png 336w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-5-300x121.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" data-srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-5.png 336w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-5-300x121.png 300w" data-src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-5.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>The prompt will change to include <code>#</code>, and the <code>[edit]</code> line will appear to designate that you are in configure mode.</p>



<p>Next, you need to add your LAN IP.  You can check your interfaces by typing <code>run show interfaces</code>.  This tells VyOS to show all the interfaces in operational mode (the mode you were in before you typed <code>conf</code>).</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-4.png" alt="" width="580" height="98" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-4.png 600w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-4-300x51.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-4.png 600w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-4-300x51.png 300w" data-src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-4.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>In my case, <code>eth1</code> is attached to my LAN here.  I’m going to use the subnet from above, <code>10.32.0.0/24</code>.  I prefer to use <code>.1</code> for my routers, but you can use any IP in that range.</p>



<p>There are two methods to assign it once in <code>conf</code> mode.  Either with the full path, or by drilling-down.</p>



<p>Full path:</p>



<pre><code>configure
set interfaces ethernet eth1 address 10.32.0.1/24
set interfaces ethernet eth1 description LAN
commit
save</code></pre>



<p>Drill down:</p>



<pre><code>configure
edit interfaces ethernet eth1
set address 10.32.0.1/24
set description LAN
commit
save</code></pre>



<p>Committing makes the configuration active, and saving saves it to disk so it will persist on a reboot.</p>

<h4><span id="Set_up_DHCP">Set up DHCP</span></h4>



<p>Now that that router has a LAN IP, it’s time to connect your laptop/desktop/etc up to it.  </p>



<p>You can assign it a static IP in the chosen subnet (<code>10.32.0.10/24</code> for example), but I imagine you are also going to want to assign a DHCP range for automatic configuration of clients.</p>



<hr>



<p>Goals:</p>



<ul><li>Enter configure mode</li><li>Set up DHCP ranges</li><li>commit and save</li></ul>



<hr>



<p>Let’s talk about the following config.  </p>



<p>We are going to make two DHCP ranges, and leave some holes.  This would allow us to assign the IP addresses between <code>.2</code> and <code>.49</code> for static or other uses, as well as <code>.126-199</code> and <code>.251-254</code>.</p>



<p>While this is a non-standard usage, it demonstrates the capabilities. Many people would just have a single range. </p>



<pre><code>set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 10.32.0.0/24 range 0 start 10.32.0.50
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 10.32.0.0/24 range 0 stop 10.32.0.125
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 10.32.0.0/24 range 1 start 10.32.0.200
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 10.32.0.0/24 range 1 stop 10.32.0.250</code></pre>



<p>Some other important config options follow.   </p>



<p>You want to tell the DHCP server to hand out the router’s IP address as the default gateway and DNS.  This will make it so (eventually), your LAN devices will have DNS and routing to the Internet:</p>



<pre><code>set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 10.32.0.0/24 dns-server 10.32.0.1
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 10.32.0.0/24 default-router 10.32.0.1</code></pre>


<div id=""><p>DNS Alert</p><p>This would also be the place to insert something like your pi-hole or active directory DNS server.  In the above example, your pi-hole/ADDNS address or addresses would be where the dns-server option is. </p></div>

<h4><span id="SSH">SSH</span></h4>



<p>The final step before we can access the router over SSH is to actually enable SSH:</p>



<pre><code>set service ssh port 22
commit
save</code></pre>



<p>At this point you ought to be able to hook up a LAN client, and verify that you have an IP, gateway, and DNS.  </p>



<p>This is a fairly stock Debian VM I set up.  As you can see, my IP is in one of my DHCP ranges, and my DNS and default route are the router’s IP. </p>



<p>This is on Linux, but the same thing could be confirmed on Windows or MacOS:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="736" height="472" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-16.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-16.png 736w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-16-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" data-srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-16.png 736w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-16-300x192.png 300w" data-src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-16.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>From there, you should be able to ssh into the router with the username <code>vyos</code> and password you set up during install:<br></p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="541" height="191" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-13.png 541w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-13-300x106.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px" data-srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-13.png 541w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-13-300x106.png 300w" data-src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-13.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>And typing <code>show configuration</code> (in op mode), should show you the work done so far.  VyOS also comes with a few defaults, like NTP servers configured.</p>

<h2><span id="NAT_DNS">NAT &amp; DNS</span></h2>



<h3><span id="NAT">NAT</span></h3>



<p>The next important duty for a router and firewall is to be able to NAT.  NAT allows all your private LAN devices to access the Internet.  </p>


<div id=""><p>Information Dump</p><div><p>
Back when the Internet started, every device had a unique IP address. 
</p><p>Unfortunately, because of the numbering scheme used, there are only 4.2 billion of these address, at least in IPv4, and the transition to IPv6 is far from complete.</p>
<p>Because of this, every device on your network needs to be able to “pretend” that it is your router to access the Internet.  Your router keeps track of which requests belong to which device.  </p>
<p>Source NAT is what allows you to do this.</p>
<p>This is also where the above mentioned “summary route” can come into play.  Instead of creating three separate NAT rules for 10.32.1.0/24, 10.32.2.0/24, and 10.32.3.0/24, you can create a single rule for 10.32.0.0/16.<br>
</p></div></div>



<p>For this setup, it’s important to identify which network interface will eventually be your WAN interface, even though it’s not configured yet.</p>



<hr>



<p>Goals:</p>



<ul><li>As before, enter configuration mode.</li><li>Set up a source NAT rule to target our LAN or LAN subnets.</li><li>Define the outgoing WAN interface on the rule.</li><li>Set the translation type of the rule to <code>masquerade</code>. </li></ul>



<hr>



<p>The type of NAT we will be using is called <code>SOURCE NAT</code>.  This type of NAT is going to have three components:</p>



<ul><li>Target all traffic from our LAN or LANs…</li><li>… when the traffic is going out to the Internet through this outgoing interface…</li><li>… Change the IP address from the LAN IP to the WAN IP</li></ul>



<p>To do this:</p>



<pre><code>set nat source rule 100 source address '10.32.0.0/24'
set nat source rule 100 outbound-interface 'eth0'
set nat source rule 100 translation address masquerade
commit
save</code></pre>



<p>In the above example, the <code>100</code> is an arbitrary number (between 1-9999).  The <code>eth0</code> is my eventual WAN interface.  <code>masquerade</code> translates the internal LAN IP to your public WAN IP.  </p>

<p>Once we set up our WAN interface, we’ll be able to type <code>show nat source rules</code> in op mode, or <code>run show nat source rules</code> in conf mode to run the op mode command, it will be clear what’s happening.</p>



<hr>



<h3><span id="DNS">DNS</span></h3>



<p>The next step is to set up our VyOS instance as for DNS.  This will allow you to use local DNS and caching instead of your ISP’s, but also eventually will allow you run custom DNS and hosts. </p>



<hr>



<p>Goals:</p>



<ul><li>Enter config mode</li><li>Set the DNS Listen Address</li><li>Set the subnets we are allowing from</li><li>Set the cache size to 0</li><li>commit and save</li></ul>



<hr>



<pre><code>set service dns forwarding listen-address '10.32.0.1'
set service dns forwarding allow-from '10.32.0.0/24'
set service dns forwarding cache-size '0'
commit
save</code></pre>



<p>As mentioned, this accomplishes three things.  </p>



<ul><li>It tells VyOS to listen for DNS requests on its LAN IP, <code>10.32.0.1</code>.  </li><li>It limits requests from your LAN subnet.  </li><li>Finally, it sets the cache size to 0.  This is good to start out with to make sure everything is working, but later you can bump it up to speed up multiple requests for the same sites. </li></ul>



<hr>


<div id=""><p>Opportunity Alert</p><div><p>
This is another opportunity to use the “summary” route that I’ve mentioned a few times.  
</p><p>Instead of allowing “10.32.0.0/24”, you would allow “10.32.0.0/16”.  This would ensure that as you add VLANs and subnets, your DNS will just work without adding a long list of /24s.<br>
</p></div></div>



<hr>

<hr>



<h4><span id="DNS_Forwarding">DNS Forwarding</span></h4>



<p>There is one more consideration to be made.  As configured, your DNS server will run in “recursor” mode.  This means it will take responsibility for fully resolving DNS on its own.  This may be a bad thing for a number of reasons:</p>



<ul><li>It leaks your IP to potential undesirables.  </li><li>It’s almost always slower, as you don’t get to benefit from the caches of a large service like CloudFlare or Google.  </li></ul>



<p>It’s quite simple to set up in forwarding mode, meaning when you make a DNS request, you end up asking an upstream resolver.  </p>



<p>In the following example, we’ll be using CloudFlare and Google:</p>



<pre><code>set service dns forwarding name-server 1.1.1.1
set service dns forwarding name-server 1.0.0.1
set service dns forwarding name-server 8.8.8.8
set service dns forwarding name-server 8.8.4.4
commit
save</code></pre>

<hr>



<h4><span id="System_DNS">System DNS</span></h4>



<p>One final step is to set the DNS for VyOS itself.  Everything we’ve done so far has just set up VyOS to be a DNS server for your clients.</p>



<p>This will be the DNS that is used, for example, when you do a VyOS update, ping or traceroute from VyOS, etc.</p>



<p>The easiest thing to do if you’ve been following this guide, is just to use the DNS server you set up above:</p>



<pre><code>set system name-server 10.32.0.1
commit
save</code></pre>



<p>This is also another spot where if you wanted to use Google, CloudFlare, or AD-DNS, you could plug in that IP:</p>

<p>Alternatively, you call tell VyOS to use the DNS servers that it received from your WAN DHCP server with:</p>



<pre><code>set system name-servers-dhcp eth0</code></pre>

<h2><span id="Firewall">Firewall</span></h2>



<p>If you’ve made it this far, congrats!  We are almost there! </p>



<p>This section will cover the creation of a zone-based firewall, which is far superior to the default method of attaching firewalls to interfaces.  </p>



<p>The reason it is superior is simple.  It’s a bit more hassle to set up, but it’s far easier to manage on an ongoing basis, plus, you start thinking about firewalling as flows of information from interface to interface.</p>



<hr>



<p>Goals:</p>



<ul><li>Enter configuration mode</li><li>Create a firewall to allow all LAN traffic.</li><li>Create firewall to allow all LAN traffic to access VyOS itself.</li><li>Create a firewall to protect the router itself from WAN.</li><li>Create a firewall to protect LAN devices from WAN.</li><li>Commit</li><li>Create LOCAL/LAN zones.</li><li>Assign appropriate interfaces to zones.</li><li>Commit and save</li></ul>



<hr>



<p>For as complex as firewalling seems, it’s actually pretty simple when you break it down.  </p>



<p>A firewall tracks connection “states” to determine what is and is not allowed.  This is where packets are originating and going to, ports involved, types of traffic like TCP/UDP/ICMP, and more.  </p>



<p>We are going to build a very simple firewall that assumes that we want to block everything externally, and allow everything from LAN.</p>



<p>So let’s dig right into it.</p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="LAN">LAN</span></h2>



<p>First, create a firewall that will allow our LAN to access everything. This is a setup that would mimic what most consumer routers do:</p>



<pre><code>conf
set firewall name LAN-WAN default-action accept
set firewall name LAN-LOCAL default-action accept
commit
save</code></pre>



<p>The <code>LAN-WAN</code> and the <code>LAN-LOCAL</code> can be arbitrarily named anything.  I use this naming scheme because as mentioned above, it’s better to think about firewalls as controlling the flow of information through the router, and these names are self-documenting.</p>



<p><code>LOCAL</code> is a specific VyOS designation that means “this router”.  When you are attaching the firewall in the zones, LOCAL will be what you use to control traffic destined to the firewall itself.  </p>



<p>As should be obvious, we are just allowing everything.  But you can set whatever rules you wanted.  <code>LAN-WAN</code> would generally remain pretty open as it would be uncommon to block your own access to the Internet, but <code>LAN-LOCAL</code> might contain rules to maybe allow only specific devices access to manage the VyOS router.</p>



<p>Also note that we are just creating the firewalls here.  They don’t become active until you attach them to the zones.</p>

<hr>



<h2><span id="LOCAL">LOCAL</span></h2>



<p>As mentioned, the <code>LOCAL</code> zone is traffic destined for the VyOS router itself.  </p>



<p>In most cases, it will have a similar ruleset to the LAN one above, as most people want their router to have full access to the Internet and their LAN devices:</p>



<pre><code>conf
set firewall name LOCAL-WAN default-action accept
set firewall name LOCAL-LAN default-action accept
commit
save</code></pre>


<div id=""><p>Food for Thought</p><div>
<p>While I might be getting a little ahead of myself here, it’s important to note that you could use the same firewall instead of creating four different firewalls as we’ve done here.  The firewalls are just attached to interfaces or zones by names, so there’s nothing really stopping you from creating a single firewall and attaching it to four different places.</p>
<p>As a bit of a pro-tip though, I would recommend not doing this.  Eventually you’ll want them broken out, and it’s far more of a hassle to do it later than to just do it during initial setup.<br>
</p></div></div>

<hr>



<h2><span id="WAN">WAN</span></h2>



<p>The <code>WAN</code> zone is where we are actually going to do most of our work.  </p>



<p>The basic goal here will be two things.  To block all access to the router itself, and to provide basic setup and template for future things like port forwarding to our LAN.  </p>



<p>When you start moving data to and from the Internet, that’s when you need to start worrying about the state tracking I mentioned before.  </p>



<p>For both LOCAL and LAN traffic, we’ll be setting up what’s known as a “stateful firewall”.  </p>



<p>In stateful firewalling, there are three main states to worry about:</p>



<ul><li>New – Traffic in a <code>NEW</code> state is the first packet from a destination to a source.  Allowing or denying this packet ultimately determines whether the traffic will be allowed.</li><li>Established – Once traffic from <code>NEW</code> has been allowed, the subsequent packets are marked as <code>ESTABLISHED</code>.  This is essentially traffic that has already been allowed by other rules.  This is another basic requirement for a working stateful firewall.</li><li>Related – This means that this is traffic that is somehow related to already allowed traffic.  Also required.</li></ul>


<div id=""><p>A note about rule numbers</p><div><p>
As with the NAT rule numbers, the rule numbers you use for firewall are arbitrary.
</p><p>With that said, it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t plan ahead a bit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rules are processed numerically, so for fastest firewalling and routing, you definitely want your ESTABLISHED/RELATED rule at the top.  That ensures that existing traffic, which is going to be the bulk of the traffic your firewall processes, only has to look at a single rule.</li>
<li>Leave yourself some gaps for future rules.  You’ll appreciate it later if you want to insert a new rule before an existing one, though you can always rename and move around.</li>
</ul></div></div>



<hr>



<h3><span id="WAN-LOCAL">WAN-LOCAL</span></h3>



<p>As mentioned, the <code>WAN-LOCAL</code> firewall is traffic destined for the VyOS router itself.  In the future, this will be where you allow traffic, say to your WireGuard port for VPN.</p>



<p>The first rule we want to build is to allow all <code>ESTABLISHED</code> and <code>RELATED</code> traffic.  So we’ll:</p>



<ul><li>Create the WAN-LOCAL firewall.  </li><li>Set the default policy on the firewall to drop everything.  </li><li>Create a rule to accept specific traffic for rule.</li><li>Set the match for the rule to our established and related states.</li><li>Set a description for ease of use later.</li></ul>







<pre><code>set firewall name WAN-LOCAL default-action drop
set firewall name WAN-LOCAL rule 5 action accept
set firewall name WAN-LOCAL rule 5 state established enable
set firewall name WAN-LOCAL rule 5 state related enable
set firewall name WAN-LOCAL rule 5 description "Allow EST/Related Traffic"
commit
save</code></pre>

<hr>



<p>The next rule we want on is to allow ICMP.  Many people like to block this, but not me.  I’ll defer to <a href="http://shouldiblockicmp.com/">ShouldIBlockICMP.com</a> on this.</p>



<ul><li>Create a new rule matching ICMP</li><li>Match the state of <code>NEW</code>. This is what actually matches the unknown traffic to allow</li><li>Allow the traffic</li><li>Commit and save</li></ul>



<pre><code>set firewall name WAN-LOCAL rule 20 protocol icmp
set firewall name WAN-LOCAL rule 20 state new enable
set firewall name WAN-LOCAL rule 20 action accept
commit
save</code></pre>



<p>And you can see that the firewall is created (but still not attached to any interfaces), by doing the <code>op mode</code> command <code>show interfaces</code>.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="900" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-1-1024x900.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-1-1024x900.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-1-300x264.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-1-768x675.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-1.png 1176w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-1-1024x900.png 1024w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-1-300x264.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-1-768x675.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-1.png 1176w" data-src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-1-1024x900.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<h3><span id="WAN-LAN">WAN-LAN</span></h3>



<p>For now, the <code>WAN-LAN</code> firewall is identical to the <code>WAN-LOCAL</code>.  In the future, this is where you will allow your port forward rules, or other traffic you want to send to your LAN devices, so it’s helpful to break it out beforehand.</p>



<p>As before, we create the firewall, set it to drop by default, allowed EST/RELATED, and allow ICMP, which won’t do anything now, but could be helpful in the future:</p>



<pre><code>set firewall name WAN-LAN default-action drop
set firewall name WAN-LAN rule 5 action accept
set firewall name WAN-LAN rule 5 state established enable
set firewall name WAN-LAN rule 5 state related enable
set firewall name WAN-LAN rule 5 description "Allow EST/Related Traffic"
set firewall name WAN-LAN rule 20 protocol icmp
set firewall name WAN-LAN rule 20 state new enable
set firewall name WAN-LAN rule 20 action accept</code></pre>



<p>Don’t forget you can dive down into levels as in the following example:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1002" height="672" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2.png 1002w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2-300x201.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2-768x515.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1002px) 100vw, 1002px" data-srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2.png 1002w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2-300x201.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2-768x515.png 768w" data-src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<hr>



<p>Finally!  We have our firewalls set up and ready to deploy.  </p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="WAN_and_Zones">WAN and Zones</span></h2>



<p>If you’ve been paying attention, we still don’t have one <em>VERY</em> important piece to this puzzle. We still don’t have WAN access!</p>



<p>Of course I did this to protect your router during the initial setup phase.  Until you have firewalls ready to deploy, you probably don’t want to be kicking your brand new VyOS install out on the open Internet.  </p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="Zones">Zones</span></h2>



<p>Zones are easily one of my favorite parts of VyOS, and something that in my opinion, puts it lightyears ahead of other firewall solutions.</p>



<p>Especially as your firewalling needs grow, zones just make it so <em>EASY</em>.  As I sort of touched on, zones are a bit more work initially, but save you <em>MUCH</em> more time in the future.</p>


<div id=""><p>Lockout Alert</p><div><p>
Be careful and pay attention here.  
</p><p>If you mistype something and are still configuring VyOS over SSH, you can potentially lock yourself out.<br>
</p></div></div>



<p>The naming scheme as I’ve outlined above should be helpful here when creating our firewall zones.  It basically says <code>FROMZONE-&gt;TOZONE</code></p>



<p>So let’s run through the whole thing.  </p>



<p>Goals:</p>



<ul><li>Set the default action for the zone.  This should always be drop to cover yourself in case you miss something.</li><li>Apply the “For traffic from X zone to current zone, attach Y firewall”</li><li>Add the interfaces that are part of this zone</li><li>Repeat for all zones</li><li>commit</li><li>save</li></ul>



<hr>



<p>So what does this look like for the LAN:</p>



<ul><li>In this example we are working on the LAN zone</li><li>We drop everything by default</li><li>We assign the <code>WAN-LAN</code> firewall to traffic from any interface in the below <code>WAN</code> zone</li><li>Similarly for the <code>LOCAL-LAN</code>.  This is traffic from the VyOS instance itself to LAN hosts.</li><li>We put <code>eth1</code> in our LAN zone.</li></ul>



<pre><code>set zone-policy zone LAN default-action drop
set zone-policy zone LAN from WAN firewall name WAN-LAN
set zone-policy zone LAN from LOCAL firewall name LOCAL-LAN
set zone-policy zone LAN interface eth1


</code></pre>



<hr>



<p>Repeat all steps for the <code>LOCAL</code> zone.  The major difference here is the <code>local-zone</code> designation.  As I’ve mentioned a few times, <code>LOCAL</code> is a special designation that means “this firewall”, so you don’t attach interfaces:</p>



<pre><code>set zone-policy zone LOCAL local-zone
set zone-policy zone LOCAL from LAN firewall name LAN-LOCAL
set zone-policy zone LOCAL from WAN firewall name WAN-LOCAL
set zone-policy zone LOCAL default-action drop
</code></pre>



<hr>



<p>Finally, the WAN zone is basically the same as the LAN zone. The only major change you should notice is that I just changed the firewall names and interface name:</p>



<pre><code>set zone-policy zone WAN from LAN firewall name LAN-WAN
set zone-policy zone WAN from LOCAL firewall name LOCAL-WAN
set zone-policy zone WAN interface eth0
set zone-policy zone WAN default-action drop</code></pre>

<hr>



<p>If you were like me, you might have tried committing between steps.  Unfortunately, if you don’t set up everything at once, you’ll quickly discover that zones are interdependent on one another.  This happens because I’ve created the LAN zone, but the referenced WAN and LOCAL zones don’t exist yet.</p>

<h3><span id="Show_your_work">Show your work</span></h3>



<p>Hopefully, if you’ve done everything correctly, you should see all your zone policies set up under the <code>op mode</code> command <code>run show zone-policy</code>.  This view should make it obvious which traffic is flowing through what firewall:</p>

<h2><span id="WAN_Setup">WAN Setup</span></h2>



<p>Finally, here we are.  </p>



<p>Setting up your WAN. If you’ve made it this far, congrats.  You are basically 1 or 2 commands away from having a working router and firewall!</p>



<p>There are multiple ways to get a WAN address.  For simplicity’s sake, I’ll just cover two of them here, static and DHCP assignment.  For something like PPPoE, you’ll need a few more steps.</p>



<h3><span id="DHCP_Assignment">DHCP Assignment</span></h3>



<p>DHCP is when your router asks your ISP’s servers for what it should use for its IP address and routing information.  This is accomplished with one simple command (well, four if you add a description to the interface, and commit and save):</p>



<pre><code>set interfaces ethernet eth0 address dhcp
set interfaces ethernet eth0 description WAN
commit

<p>You can verify that the setup is complete with the <code>op mode</code> commands <code>run show interfaces</code> and <code>run show ip route</code>.  (I have some debug variables set, so ignore the extra output:</p>

<p>In the above output, <code>10.21.21.57</code> is the IP address I was assigned via DHCP.  The <code>show ip route</code> verifies that I have a default route.</p>


<div id=""><p>Information Dump</p><div><p>
Your “gateway” or default route, is the router your devices ask when they encounter an IP address that they don’t know how to get to.
</p><p>In the networking world, this is represented by <em>0.0.0.0/0</em>, which is a shortcut for <strong><em>the entire Internet</em></strong></p>
<p>So in the above example, this VyOS knows how to talk directly to anything in the 10.21.21.0/24 or 10.32.0.0/24 subnets because they are directly connected.  Anything outside of that, it needs to ask 10.21.21.1 for a route to it.<br>
</p></div></div>



<h3><span id="Static_IP">Static IP</span></h3>



<p>Static IPs just skip the automatic configuration.  It’s up to your ISP how this is configured, but usually it’s an extra step, manually applying your default route.</p>



<p>So to duplicate my above DHCP configuration:</p>



<pre><code>set interfaces ethernet eth0 address 10.21.21.57/24
set protocols static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 10.21.21.1
commit
save</code></pre>



<p>As you can see in the following screenshot, I forgot the exact format, so I hit my <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code> button to get hints:</p>

<h3><span id="Check_your_work">Check your work</span></h3>



<p>Assuming nothing has gone wrong, you should be able to verify everything with the <code>op mode</code> command <code>ping</code>.  So let’s hit Google with 4 pings:</p>



<p><code>run ping www.google.com count 4</code></p>



<p>If all goes well, you should see a response:</p>

<p>So wow, this post turned into a bit of a novel.  Hopefully if you’ve made it this far, your LAN clients now have accessible Internet. From a client, you should be able to ping google:</p>

<p>Obviously there are a lot of basic topics I haven’t covered yet.  But I wanted to lay out and explain the basic setup first.  </p>



<p>Future editions will feature:</p>



<ul><li>Port Forwarding.</li><li>Hairpin NAT (this goes hand-in-hand with the first).</li><li>VPNs, especially WireGuard</li><li>How routing works when you have VPNs.</li><li>Some potential hardening tactics.</li><li>Other advanced topics like BGP/OSPF.</li></ul>



<p>Cheers!</p>
