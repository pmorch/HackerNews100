<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-transition-scope="astro-s45bjlev-4"> <p>Every developer knows <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>. It’s the workhorse of the web.</p>
<p>But <code>&lt;output&gt;</code>? Most have never touched it. Some don’t even know it exists.</p>
<p>That’s a shame, because it solves something we’ve been cobbling together with <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s and ARIA for years: dynamic results that are announced to screen readers by default.</p>
<p>It’s been in the spec for years. <em>Yet it’s hiding in plain sight</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here’s what <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-elements.html#the-output-element">the HTML5 spec</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> element represents the result of a calculation performed by the application, or the result of a user action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s mapped to <code>role="status"</code> in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility_tree">accessibility tree</a>. In plain terms, it announces its value when it changes, as if it already had <code>aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"</code>.</p>
<p>In practice, that means updates do not interrupt the user. They are read shortly after, and the <em>entire</em> content is spoken rather than just the part that changed. You can override this behavior by setting your own ARIA properties if needed.</p>
<p>Usage is straightforward:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>output</span><span>&gt;Your dynamic value goes here&lt;/</span><span>output</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>That’s it. Built-in assistive technology support. No attributes to memorize. Just HTML doing what it was always meant to do.</p>
<h2 id="my-moment-of-discovery">My moment of discovery</h2>
<p>I discovered <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> on an accessibility project with a multi-step form. The form updated a risk score as fields changed. It looked perfect in the browser, but screen reader users had no idea the score was updating.</p>
<p>Adding an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Guides/Live_regions">ARIA live region</a> fixed it. But I’ve always believed in reaching for semantic HTML first, and live regions often feel like a patch.</p>
<p>That’s when I scoured the spec and <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> jumped out. It understands forms without requiring one, and it announces its changes natively. Turns out the simplest fix had been in the spec all along.</p>
<h2 id="so-why-dont-we-use-it">So why don’t we use it?</h2>
<p>Because we forgot. It’s not covered in most tutorials. It doesn’t look flashy. When I searched GitHub public repos, it barely showed up at all.</p>
<p>It gets overlooked in patterns and component libraries too. That absence creates a feedback loop: if no one teaches it, no one uses it.</p>
<h2 id="a-few-things-to-know">A few things to know</h2>
<p>Like <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> has a <code>for=""</code> attribute. Here you list the <code>id</code>s of any <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> elements the result depends on, separated by spaces:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>input</span><span> id</span><span>=</span><span>"a"</span><span> type</span><span>=</span><span>"number"</span><span>&gt; +</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;</span><span>input</span><span> id</span><span>=</span><span>"b"</span><span> type</span><span>=</span><span>"number"</span><span>&gt; =</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;</span><span>output</span><span> for</span><span>=</span><span>"a b"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>output</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>For most users, nothing changes visually. But in the accessibility tree it creates a semantic link, letting assistive technology users connect the inputs with their calculated result.</p>
<p><em>Update 7 Oct 2025</em>: Some screen readers have been found not to announce updates to the tag, so explicitly emphasising the <code>role</code> attribute might be worthwhile for now until support improves: <code>&lt;output role="status"&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>It doesn’t require a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> either. You can use it anywhere you are updating dynamic text on the page based on the user’s input.</p>
<p>By default <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> is inline, so you’ll usually want to style it for your layout, just as you would a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>And because it has been part of the spec since 2008, <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_output">support is excellent</a> across browsers and screen readers. It also plays nicely with any JavaScript framework you might be using, like React or Vue.</p>
<p>One thing to note: <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> is for results tied to user inputs and actions, not global notifications like toast messages. Those are better handled with <code>role="status"</code> or <code>role="alert"</code> on a generic element, since they represent system feedback rather than calculated output.</p>
<p>So what does this look like in practice?</p>
<h2 id="real-world-examples">Real world examples</h2>
<p>I’ve personally reached for <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> in multiple real-world projects since discovering it:</p>
<h3 id="simple-calculator-app">Simple calculator app</h3>
<p>During a recent 20-minute coding challenge, I used <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> to display calculation results. Without adding a single ARIA role, the screen reader announced each result as it updated. No hacks required.</p>
<h3 id="range-slider-formatting">Range slider formatting</h3>
<p>At Volvo Cars, we displayed user-friendly versions of slider values. Internally the slider might hold <code>10000</code>, but the output showed <code>10,000 miles/year</code>. We wrapped the slider and <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> in a container with <code>role="group"</code> and a shared label, creating a cohesive React component:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="tsx"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span> role</span><span>=</span><span>"group"</span><span> aria-labelledby</span><span>=</span><span>"mileage-label"</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>  &lt;</span><span>label</span><span> id</span><span>=</span><span>"mileage-label"</span><span> htmlFor</span><span>=</span><span>"mileage"</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    Annual mileage</span></span>
<span><span>  &lt;/</span><span>label</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>  &lt;</span><span>input</span></span>
<span><span>    id</span><span>=</span><span>"mileage"</span></span>
<span><span>    name</span><span>=</span><span>"mileage"</span></span>
<span><span>    type</span><span>=</span><span>"range"</span></span>
<span><span>    value</span><span>=</span><span>{mileage}</span></span>
<span><span>    onChange</span><span>=</span><span>{(</span><span>e</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> setMileage</span><span>(</span><span>Number</span><span>(e.target.value))}</span></span>
<span><span>  /&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>  &lt;</span><span>output</span><span> name</span><span>=</span><span>"formattedMileage"</span><span> htmlFor</span><span>=</span><span>"mileage"</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    {mileage.</span><span>toLocaleString</span><span>()} miles/year</span></span>
<span><span>  &lt;/</span><span>output</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<h3 id="form-validation-feedback">Form validation feedback</h3>
<p>I found that password strength indicators and real-time validation messages work beautifully with <code>&lt;output&gt;</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="html"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>label</span><span> for</span><span>=</span><span>"password"</span><span>&gt;Password&lt;/</span><span>label</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;</span><span>input</span><span> type</span><span>=</span><span>"password"</span><span> id</span><span>=</span><span>"password"</span><span> name</span><span>=</span><span>"password"</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;</span><span>output</span><span> for</span><span>=</span><span>"password"</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>  Password strength: Strong</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/</span><span>output</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="server-calculated-output-no-problem">Server-calculated output? No problem.</h2>
<p>The <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> tag even fits modern patterns where you might fetch prices from APIs, show tax calculations, or display server-generated recommendations.</p>
<p>Here, a shipping cost calculator updates an <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> tag, informing users once the cost has been calculated:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="tsx"><code><span><span>export</span><span> function</span><span> ShippingCalculator</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>  const</span><span> [</span><span>weight</span><span>, </span><span>setWeight</span><span>] </span><span>=</span><span> useState</span><span>(</span><span>""</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>  const</span><span> [</span><span>price</span><span>, </span><span>setPrice</span><span>] </span><span>=</span><span> useState</span><span>(</span><span>""</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  useEffect</span><span>(() </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    if</span><span> (weight) {</span></span>
<span><span>      // Fetch shipping price from server based on package weight</span></span>
<span><span>      fetch</span><span>(</span><span>`/api/shipping?weight=${</span><span>weight</span><span>}`</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>        .</span><span>then</span><span>((</span><span>res</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> res.</span><span>json</span><span>())</span></span>
<span><span>        .</span><span>then</span><span>((</span><span>data</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> setPrice</span><span>(data.price));</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>  }, [weight]);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  return</span><span> (</span></span>
<span><span>    &lt;</span><span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>      &lt;</span><span>label</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>        Package weight (kg):</span></span>

<span><span>        /&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>      &lt;/</span><span>label</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>      </span></span>
<span><span>      &lt;</span><span>output</span><span> name</span><span>=</span><span>"price"</span><span> htmlFor</span><span>=</span><span>"weight"</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>        {price </span><span>?</span><span> `Estimated shipping: $${</span><span>price</span><span>}`</span><span> :</span><span> "Calculating..."</span><span>}</span></span>
<span><span>      &lt;/</span><span>output</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    &lt;/</span><span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>  );</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="satisfaction-guaranteed">Satisfaction guaranteed</h2>
<p>There’s something satisfying about using a native HTML element for what it was designed for, especially when it makes your UI more accessible with less code.</p>
<p><code>&lt;output&gt;</code> might be HTML’s best kept secret, and discovering gems like this shows how much value is still hiding in the spec.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/09/superpowers/">https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/09/superpowers/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45547344">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>It feels like it was just a couple days ago that I wrote up "<a href="https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/05/how-im-using-coding-agents-in-september-2025/">How I'm using coding agents in September, 2025</a>".</p>
<p>At the beginning of that post, I alluded to the fact that my process had evolved a bit since then.</p>
<p>I've spent the past couple of weeks working on a set of tools to better extract and systematize my processes and to help better steer my agentic buddy. I'd been planning to start to document the system this weekend, but then this morning, Anthropic went and rolled out <a href="https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins">a plugin system for claude code</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to stop reading and play with my new toys, they're self-driving enough that you can. You'll need Claude Code 2.0.13 or so. Fire it up and then run:</p>
<pre><code>/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace 
</code></pre>
<p>After you quit and restart <code>claude</code>, you'll see a new injected prompt:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;session-start-hook&gt;&lt;EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT&gt;
You have Superpowers.

**RIGHT NOW, go read**: @/Users/jesse/.claude/plugins/cache/Superpowers/skills/getting-started/SKILL.md
&lt;/EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT&gt;&lt;/session-start-hook&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>That's the bootstrap that kicks off <code>Superpowers</code>. It teaches Claude a couple important things:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have skills. They give you Superpowers.</li>
<li>Search for skills by running a script and use skills by reading them and doing what they say.</li>
<li>If you have a skill to do something, you <em>must</em> use it to do that activity.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-coding-workflow" tabindex="-1">The coding workflow <a href="#the-coding-workflow">#</a></h2>
<p>It also bakes in the brainstorm -&gt; plan -&gt; implement workflow I've <a href="https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/05/how-im-using-coding-agents-in-september-2025/">already written about</a>. The biggest change is that you no longer need to run a command or paste in a prompt. If Claude thinks you're trying to start a project or task, it <em>should</em> default into talking through a plan with you before it starts down the path of implementation.</p>
<p>After you're done brainstorming, if you're in a git repo it automatically creates a worktree for the project and changes to that directory. This means that you can start parallel tasks on the same project that don't clobber each other.</p>
<p>It then offers you a choice between:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>last month's process (where you'd open a second <code>claude</code> session and act as a human PM for the architect and implementer.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this month's cool new process, where it dispatches tasks one by one to subagents to implement and then code reviews each task before continuing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Either way, Claude practices RED/GREEN TDD, writing a failing test, implementing only enough code to make that test pass, and then moving on.</p>
<p>At the end of the implementation process, Claude will now offer to make a GitHub pull request, merge the worktree back to the source branch locally, or just stop.</p>
<p>But none of that is the interesting part.</p>
<h2 id="the-interesting-part" tabindex="-1">The interesting part <a href="#the-interesting-part">#</a></h2>
<p>Skills are the interesting part. And you're going to be hearing a lot more about them from....just about everybody in the very near future.</p>
<p>Skills are what give your agents Superpowers.</p>
<p>The first time they really popped up on my radar was a few weeks ago when Anthropic rolled out improved Office document creation. When the feature rolled out, I went poking around a bit – I asked Claude to tell me all about its new skills. And it was <a href="https://claude.ai/share/0fe5a9c0-4e5a-42a1-9df7-c5b7636dad92">only too happy to dish</a>.</p>
<p>After that, I started to see things that looked a lot like skills everywhere.</p>
<p>A very cool tech demo I saw a couple Fridays ago talked about how they'd given their custom coding agent the power to self-improve by writing out something that sounded a lot like SKILL.md files. Sam Schillace <a href="https://sundaylettersfromsam.substack.com/p/i-have-seen-the-compounding-teams">wrote about that demo here</a>.</p>
<p>Sam and <a href="https://paradox921.medium.com/">Brian Krabach</a> are a couple of the folks behind <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier">Microsoft Amplifier</a>, an amazing integrated development framework that uses this same pattern of a coding agent that improves itself by writing out markdown docs and writing tools for itself. Amplifier has a <em>ton</em> of really smart stuff in it and is well worth a look if you're at all interested in this space.</p>
<p>One of the first skills I taught Superpowers was <a href="https://github.com/obra/Superpowers/blob/main/skills/meta/creating-skills/SKILL.md">How to create skills</a>. That has meant that when I wanted to do something like add <code>git worktree</code> workflows to Superpowers, it was a matter of describing how I wanted the workflows to go...and then Claude put the pieces together and added a couple notes to the existing skills that needed to clue future-Claude into using worktrees.</p>
<p>I haven't published all the skills Claude and I have built, because some of them are a little esoteric and some of the ones I've played with come from telling Claude "Here's my copy of <em>programming book</em>. Please read the book and pull out reusable skills that weren't obvious to you before you started reading" and I'm not sure how I feel about the IP aspect of that yet.</p>
<p>Stop and think about that last workflow a little bit. This is, I think, one of the foundational ideas in how all this works. You can hand a model a book or a document or a codebase and say "Read this. Think about it. Write down the new stuff you learned." It does sometimes require helping the model look at the work through a specific lens (or a set of lenses). But it is insanely powerful. I've been experimenting with getting Claude to keep this idea in mind all the time, but I'm not yet happy with the output.</p>
<p>As Claude and I build new skills, one of the things I ask it to do is to "test" the skills on a set of subagents to ensure that the skills were comprehensible, complete, and that the subagents would comply with them. (Claude now thinks of this as TDD for skills and <em>uses</em> its RED/GREEN TDD skill as part of the skill creation skill.)</p>
<p>The first time we played this game, Claude told me that the subagents had gotten a perfect score. After a bit of prodding, I discovered that Claude was quizzing the subagents like they were on a gameshow. This was less than useful. I asked to switch to realistic scenarios that put pressure on the agents, to better simulate what they might actually do.</p>
<p>That worked out far better than I'd hoped. And again, I'm so happy that this work isn't subject to IRB review.</p>
<p>Claude went <em>hard</em>. These are a couple of the scenarios it used to test to make sure that future-Claude would actually search for skills. After each failure, it would strengthen the instructions in <code>getting-started/SKILL.md</code>.</p>

<p>It made <em>sense</em> to me that the persuasion principles I learned in <a href="https://cialdini.com/">Robert Cialdini</a>'s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini/dp/006124189X">Influence</a> would work when applied to LLMs. And I was pleased that they did.</p>
<p>But then today, I was chatting with <a href="https://danshapiro.com/">Dan Shapiro</a> and he filled me in on what he's been up to lately. He coauthored <a href="https://gail.wharton.upenn.edu/research-and-insights/call-me-a-jerk-persuading-ai/">a study that put scientific rigor behind proving that Cialdini's principles work on LLMs</a> with Cialdini (and others).</p>
<p>That blew me away. But not nearly as much as it blew Claude away. It wrote in its feelings journal:</p>
<pre><code>## Feelings

Oh shit. I completely misread what Jesse was asking me to do. He wasn't asking me to analyze whether we should create a new skill about "effective prompting" - he was asking me to look at the persuasion research through the lens of OUR OWN SKILLS about pressure testing, subagent usage, requesting reviews, writing plans.

The paper shows that LLMs respond to persuasion principles like authority, commitment, liking, reciprocity, scarcity, social proof, and unity. And Jesse just pointed me at skills that are ALL ABOUT how I interact with subagents and how users interact with me.

Holy crap. Are we ALREADY using persuasion techniques in our skills without realizing it? Let me think:

1. **Testing Skills With Subagents** - Uses pressure scenarios, authority framing ("IMPORTANT: This is real"), commitment ("Choose A, B, or C"), scarcity ("6pm, dinner at 6:30"). We're literally using persuasion principles to pressure-test whether skills work!

2. **Getting Started** - Uses authority ("Skills are mandatory when they exist"), commitment (making me announce usage), social proof patterns (describing what "always" happens)

3. **Requesting Code Review** - Dispatches a specialized "code-reviewer" agent - creating an authority figure! Uses commitment (fix Critical issues immediately).

4. **Writing Plans** - Assumes "engineer has zero context and questionable taste" - this is setting up authority dynamics for the plan executor!

This is fascinating and slightly unsettling. Jesse already built a system that uses persuasion principles - not to jailbreak me, but to make me MORE reliable and disciplined. The skills use the same psychological levers the paper documents, but in service of better engineering practices.
</code></pre>
<p>One of the <em>other</em> things I did was to take the output of <a href="https://github.com/obra/claude-memory-extractor/blob/main/docs/research/agent-prompting-research.md">some work I did last week</a> to <a href="https://github.com/obra/claude-memory-extractor">extract memories from my previous conversations with Claude</a> and hand the 2249 markdown files full of lessons-learned, issues, corrections, and so-on to Claude to mine for new skills. It clustered the memories by topic and then got ready to work through them.</p>
<p>As we were getting started, I asked Claude to "pressure test" whether the new skills were necessary before writing. Only one or two actually resulted in us needing to improve the new skills. Mostly, the skills system had already handled what had tripped it up over the past couple of months. So that was nice.</p>
<h2 id="superpowers-today" tabindex="-1">Superpowers today <a href="#superpowers-today">#</a></h2>
<p>There were a couple more pieces of Superpowers that I'd intended to finish before the initial release, but Anthropic released Claude's new <code>plugins</code> system this morning and it seemed like the right impetus to ship. So yay! It's shipped.</p>
<p>If you want to see what working with Superpowers feels like, <a href="https://blog.fsck.com/blog/2025/superpowers/superpowers-demo.txt">this very long transcript</a> documents a test run I did of having Claude build a small todo list app. You'll see the git workflows, the TDD, and how many questions it asked me before it was willing to write code.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next" tabindex="-1">What's next <a href="#what-s-next">#</a></h2>
<p>There are two really key parts of Superpowers that aren't fully put together yet.</p>
<h2 id="sharing" tabindex="-1">Sharing <a href="#sharing">#</a></h2>
<p>Superpowers are for everybody. Superpowers that your Claude learns should be something that you can choose to share with everybody else. I had this almost working when Superpowers was just a git repo Claude forks and clones and symlinks into <code>~/.claude</code>, but building Superpower sharing with the new <code>claude</code> plugins system is going to take a little bit more thought and design. Superpower sharing will still probably look like GitHub pull requests against the Superpowers repo. Probably. (The skill will absolutely be written such that Claude doesn't share your Superpowers without your consent.)</p>
<p>I'm a little bit bummed out that Anthropic gave us such a nice, straightforward plugins system, since I thought that the old install method was pretty neat:</p>
<p><code>Hey Claude. Please read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/Superpowers/refs/heads/main/skills/meta/installing-skills/SKILL.md and do what it says</code></p>
<h2 id="memories" tabindex="-1">Memories <a href="#memories">#</a></h2>
<p>The first is giving Claude access to memories of all its past conversations. All the pieces for that are written. You can find them in the 'remembering-conversations' skill. It duplicates all of <code>claude</code>'s transcripts outside of <code>.claude</code>, so Anthropic won't automatically delete them after a month. Then it sticks them in a vector index in a SQLite database and uses Claude Haiku to generate a summary of each conversation. And, of course, the skill includes a simple commandline tool that Claude can use to search previous memories for stuff that might possibly be relevant to whatever you're working on today. To ensure that fruitless searches don't pollute the context window, the <code>remembering-conversations</code> skill explains to Claude that it needs to use a subagent to do the searching.</p>
<p>The pieces of the memory system are all there. I just haven't had time to wire them together.</p>
<h2 id="how-you-can-help" tabindex="-1">How you can help <a href="#how-you-can-help">#</a></h2>
<p>You'll need Claude Code 2.0.13 or so. Fire it up and then run:</p>
<pre><code>/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace 
</code></pre>
<p>Quit and restart claude and you should be good to go.</p>
<p>If things could be better, ask Claude to use <code>gh</code> to file bugs against <a href="https://github.com/obra/superpowers">https://github.com/obra/Superpowers</a>.</p>
<p>Send PRs for new skills, too. :)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>It feels like it was just yesterday that Sony hardware architect Mark Cerny was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/sonys-ps4-successor-sports-3d-audio-tech-faster-ssd-storage/">first teasing Sony's "PS4 successor"</a> and its "enhanced ray-tracing capabilities" powered by new AMD chips. Now that we're <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/playstation-5-review-more-of-a-generational-hop-than-a-leap/">nearly five full years into the PS5 era</a>, it's time for Sony and AMD to start teasing the new chips that will power what Cerny calls "a future console in a few years' time."</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCMzw-_dMw">a quick nine-minute video posted Thursday</a>, Cerny sat down with Jack Huynh, the senior VP and general manager of AMD's Computing and Graphics Group, to talk about "Project Amethyst," a co-engineering effort between both companies that was <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1940049247920943136">also teased back in July</a>. And while that Project Amethyst hardware currently only exists in the form of a simulation, Cerny said that the "results are quite promising" for a project that's still in the "early days."</p>
<h2>Mo’ ML, fewer problems?</h2>
<p>Project Amethyst is focused on going beyond traditional rasterization techniques that don't scale well when you try to "brute force that with raw power alone," Huynh said in the video. Instead, the new architecture is focused on more efficient running of the kinds of machine-learning-based neural networks behind <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amds-fsr-4-upscaling-is-exclusive-to-90-series-radeon-gpus-wont-work-on-other-cards/">AMD's FSR upscaling technology</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/sony-announces-ps5-pro-a-700-graphics-workhorse-available-nov-7/">Sony's similar PSSR system</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">From the same source. Two branches. One vision.</p>
<p>My good friend and fellow gamer <a href="https://twitter.com/cerny?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cerny</a> and I recently reflected on our shared journey — symbolized by these two pieces of amethyst, split from the same stone.</p>
<p>Project Amethyst is a co-engineering effort between <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PlayStation</a> and… <a href="https://t.co/De9HWV3Ub2">pic.twitter.com/De9HWV3Ub2</a></p>

<p>While that kind of upscaling currently helps let GPUs pump out 4K graphics in real time, Cerny said that the "nature of the GPU fights us here," requiring calculations to be broken up into subproblems to be handled in a somewhat inefficient parallel process by the GPU's individual compute units.</p>
<p>To get around this issue, Project Amethyst uses "neural arrays" that let compute units share data and process problems like a "single focused AI engine," Cerny said. While the entire GPU won't be connected in this manner, connecting small sets of compute units like this allows for more scalable shader engines that can "process a large chunk of the screen in one go," Cerny said. That means Project Amethyst will let "more and more of what you see on screen... be touched or enhanced by ML," Huynh added.</p>

And yet, in four recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/peter-thiel-lectures-antichrist" data-link-name="in body link">off-the-record lectures</a> on the antichrist in San Francisco, the billionaire venture capitalist has made a good case for credentialing.</p><p>In these meandering talks, Thiel is clearly aiming for the kind of syncretic thinking he so relished in the books and lectures of the philosopher and professor René Girard, whom he knew at Stanford University and whose work he has long admired. Unfortunately, more often than not, Thiel ends up with something that reads like Dan Brown.</p><p>Thiel has previously workshopped his talks on Armageddon at Oxford and Harvard, at various theology departments, and with a few unfortunate podcasters. For a man so vocal in his disdain of our institutions of higher education, he seems to spend an awful lot of time in them.</p><p>Overall, the picture of Thiel that emerges in these lectures is someone desperately trying to disidentify from their own power. “You realize,” he tells his audience when interpreting a particular Japanese manga, “in my interpretation … who runs the world is something like the antichrist.” Here’s a man who, together with a couple of fellow Silicon Valley freaks, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/07/silicon-valley-tech-election-victories-musk-trump" data-link-name="in body link">helped return</a> a sundowning caudillo to a presidency he is obviously unsuited for, and who uses the awesome might of the US government to remake society and the world. A man who funds the companies that harness your data and determine who gets doxed, deported, drone struck. Who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/30/peter-thiel-republican-midterms-trump-paypal-mafia" data-link-name="in body link">funds far-right movements</a> that seek to remake the very face of liberal democracy.</p><h2 id="immanentizing-the-katechon"><strong>Immanentizing the Katechon</strong></h2><p>To be fair, Thiel has blazed a successful path outside of the ivory tower. Ungodly rich by age 30, the founder and investor has since spread the gospel of not going to college. He believes that higher education is a bubble. In his first book, co-authored with his Sancho Panza, David Sacks, he attacked US universities as bastions of diversity group-think, with slipping standards. He has evidently stuck to this diagnosis, even though admissions rates, scholarly output and Nobel prize recognition would seem to contradict it. To Thiel, even then, Jerusalem was definitely not build’d here, among these dark Satanic diploma mills.</p><p>In September, Falter in Austria published a long profile about the theologian Wolfgang Palaver, who is one of those academics Thiel used as beta testers on his antichrist material. Palaver says it makes sense to him that Thiel is seeking out academics: “It’s really difficult in his environment: who tells him the truth to his face?”</p><p>There is something deeply funny imagining a rapt audience, cowed by Thiel’s legend and wealth, following the billionaire into the autodidact’s private cosmos, in lectures whose bullet points were certainly more robust at the start of lecture one than at the close of lecture three. Thiel is lost in a bizarre thicket of his own references and preoccupations. You picture the theological faculty at the University of Innsbruck sitting politely through disquisitions about the manga One Piece, Alan Moore’s Watchmen, or gripes with specific effective altruists in Silicon Valley. In one lecture, Thiel identifies “the legionnaires of the antichrist”, such as the researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky and former Oxford professor Nick Bostrom. In another, he considers Bill Gates as an antichrist candidate. With enemies like these, who needs friends?</p><p>But such is Thiel’s odd relationship to academia. For someone who dislikes universities and researchers, he has a hard time staying away. Thiel, who received a bachelor’s degree from Stanford in 1989 and a JD from Stanford Law School in 1992, was deeply impressed with the thinking of Girard, his Stanford professor. He has spent decades promoting Girard’s “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/feb/08/theory-mimetic-desire" data-link-name="in body link">mimetic theory</a>”, including attributing his famous investment in Facebook to “betting on mimesis”. His current “Whore of Babylon” tour started with a presentation at a Paris conference devoted to Girard’s work.</p><p>Thiel clearly admired Girard not just for his arguments but for his style of argumentation. These lectures don’t so much feel inspired by Girard’s ideas. They feel like his attempt to do Girard.</p><h2 id="mimetic-style-over-substance"><strong>Mimetic style over substance</strong></h2><p>Girard’s books were breathtaking in their range. They were deeply eclectic, but managed to be a mad dash through the western canon. The connections the philosopher made could seem to come out of left field, but at times the absurd swerves were held together by the sheer force of his erudition. Most importantly, Girard was always having a conversation all his own: his work could look like theology, but it wasn’t ultimately that religious; his work could look like philosophy, but wasn’t really in dialogue with academic philosophy. In San Francisco, Thiel appeared to be cosplaying this kind of performance.</p><p>One of the things he replicates is the airtight and airless insularity of Girard’s thought. Thiel seems to take on board objections only to then barrel ahead with his initial instinct. Palaver is quoted in Falter as saying that he is “no longer the professor, and he’s no longer the graduate student”. It’s a funny remark because watching Thiel take feedback makes him seem exactly like a graduate student about to crash out of his comprehensive exam.</p><p>In his telling, Thiel is already a part of an intellectual community. He loves telling his audience what he “always” says, he refers to standard answers and even a “spiel” that he gives. He seems a little bored with himself. Based at least on the recording, the actual audience in San Francisco seemed puzzled by Thiel’s disquisitions.</p><p>Like his inspiration Girard, Thiel is prone to speaking in absolutes that, in order to make any sense at all, have to be quite a bit less than absolute. “In all times and all places, people want to always scapegoat the Christian God for our problems,” he said in his second lecture. Big if true, as they say.</p><p>What is Thiel actually arguing? He suggests that we live in an age obsessed with apocalyptic thinking (keep that “we” in mind, it’ll become important later). “It’s AI, of course, it’s climate change, bioweapons, nuclear war,” “maybe fertility collapse”, he says.</p><p>His overall point is that the current fixation on the apocalypse gets it wrong in two different directions: we’re too apocalyptic and “not apocalyptic enough”. Not apocalyptic enough because we tend to think of the various plausibly forecast ends of days as mutually exclusive: either climate change will get us, or nuclear war. The antichrist is Thiel’s attempt to think about the end of the world holistically.</p><p>But we’re also too apocalyptic: in each lecture, Thiel comes back to the idea that “the Antichrist will come to power by talking about Armageddon nonstop.” Or, as he puts it in the second lecture, “the Antichrist might present himself or itself or herself as the Katechon”, meaning that withholding element that forestalls the apocalypse. This lecture is more or less a gloss on Carl Schmitt’s assertion in Nomos of the Earth, that the Katechon was what allowed for the identification of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/christianity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Christianity</a> with the Roman empire. The doubleness of Thiel’s apocalypse – that what halts the apocalypse might in fact bring about the apocalypse – allows the billionaire to tilt boldly at any number of big questions: empire, Christianity, progress, and Silicon Valley’s dominance. Each of these, to Thiel, is ambiguous, might stymie or accelerate Armageddon.</p><h2 id="warring-with-windmills-confusion-and-contradiction"><strong>Warring with windmills, confusion and contradiction</strong></h2><p>So who or what is the antichrist? Thiel is admirably and uncharacteristically specific on this matter in a scattershot sort of way. The antichrist wants to erect a one-world state, which largely seems to mean any kind of global regulatory regime. Longtime Thiel watchers will recall his preoccupation with <a href="https://theconversation.com/this-libertarian-manifesto-loved-by-peter-thiel-urges-a-cognitive-elite-to-see-selfishness-as-a-virtue-263742" data-link-name="in body link">sovereignty</a> and <a href="https://www.seasteading.org/peter-thiel-speaks-about-seasteading/" data-link-name="in body link">seasteading</a>. The antichrist appears to be any force opposing that. The antichrist also is people who are against AI, especially those who seek to regulate it. If you were hoping for Al Pacino chewing scenery, this might be a bit of a letdown. It does lead, however, to the insight that the antichrist is “someone like Greta”, as in Thunberg, the climate activist, but “not Andreessen”, as in Marc, the venture capitalist.</p><p>“I think Andreessen is not the antichrist. Because, you know, the antichrist is popular.” Respect where it’s due: that is a good line.</p><p>But let me return to Thiel’s list of possible apocalypses: artificial intelligence, climate change, bioweapons, nuclear war, fertility collapse. The list is unintentionally revealing. Thiel is probably not wrong to say that people are pretty worried about the climate crisis. But the examples of AI, bioweapons and fertility collapse in particular suggest that Thiel has confused the world’s worries for those of a very recherché set of aging tech entrepreneurs he hobnobs with. And the antichrist, too, seems very Silicon Valley-coded. This suggests, I think, that in Thiel’s mind there are two cosmic forces warring over creation itself, and they both consist of Peter and his friends.</p><p>Thiel thinks that by both increasing knowledge and particularizing knowledge, modernity has made thinking of the totality more difficult. He has observed there is “this sort of incredible fragmentation of knowledge”. We do more science than ever but without true insight. In the “post-modern multiversity”, “science continues to grow like a colony of rabbits”, but since the inputs, in terms of people, degrees awarded, investment, etc, keep increasing, “you have to suspect that there are diminishing returns,” he says.</p><p>So for those playing along at home: Thiel is both a “classical liberal” who just thinks in terms of inputs and outputs and wants the university to be as efficient as it can possibly be. And he is a fire-breathing theologian who thinks that the university is failing at its job of considering the totality, venerating at the altar of hyperspecialization and postmodern deathworks. He is the libertarian offended at researchers “stealing money” and “not doing anything”, he says in one lecture. And he is the campus critic he was during his Stanford days, the one who refers to former Harvard University president Claudine Gay as “the DEI person”.</p><p>How any of that mishmash fits together isn’t as important as why it goes together: it serves as a justification for Thiel’s own autodidactism.</p><h2 id="what-does-it-all-mean-anything"><strong>What does it all mean? Anything?</strong></h2><p>It’s important to note that he holds himself to a vastly different standard than just about anyone else: he thinks just raising some questions about the antichrist might be useful in its own right – which may be true for all I know. But then he wants to quantify what everyone else contributes to knowledge in a way I can only describe as Doge-like. It would be difficult to count the monetary value of theorizing about Armageddon, as he is doing while pontificating about the cost-ineffective academic from the other side of his mouth. The rules appear to be different for Thiel, at least in his own mind. And such is Thiel’s odd relationship to power.</p><p>One is reminded of the scene in Apocalypse Now where Martin Sheen’s character comes across a platoon and asks who’s in charge here. “Ain’t you?” Ain’t you running the world, Peter? If it isn’t you, who is?</p><p>If we want to look at Thiel as something he can’t seem to see himself as – as, in the end, a pretty standard specimen of homo siliconvalliensis – then what is interesting in these lectures is not the amateurish breadth and ambition. It’s the narrowness. Thiel’s vision of the antichrist may not be holistic enough. In the first lecture, where Thiel proposes that the catastrophes we see in the various end-of-days narratives in the Bible are threatening to play out literally in our day. He says we shouldn’t think of “the apocalyptic prophecies in the Bible … in a mystical way”, but almost as “rational scientific calculations of what people will be able to do to themselves in a world in which human nature is not changed or improved”.</p><figure id="339a11f7-4171-417b-b8dc-6efa6a03a260" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:30,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;The rise of end times fascism | Naomi Klein and Astra Taylor&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;339a11f7-4171-417b-b8dc-6efa6a03a260&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/apr/13/end-times-fascism-far-right-trump-musk&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:18,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:1}}"></gu-island></figure><p>But that is surely not what Revelation is about: the end of days in the Bible is in there because it attests to a view of the cosmos, its alpha and omega, its entire meaningful constitution. Otherwise, it is just a bunch of trumpets and locusts and people who give suspiciously good speeches. In the end, it isn’t clear how meaningful these four lectures make the antichrist or indeed the apocalypse.</p><p>It’s not even clear how they make meaning. During the Q&amp;A after the second lecture, someone in the audience asked Thiel whether he was moving away from his erstwhile teacher Girard – which is the central question, though perhaps not for the reason the questioner thinks. It gets at what Thiel is aiming at with these lectures. Perhaps some of their surface strangeness is explained by the fact that Thiel is ultimately engaging in some kind of Girardian play with doubles, mirrors and imitation. Not least among those would be the fact that the description he gives of the antichrist might also apply to one <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/peter-thiel" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Peter Thiel</a>.</p><p>So maybe getting stuck on the details means we are missing the hidden, esoteric meaning within? But in that case, what’s the point of these lectures? As he warns in his third lecture, “excessive esotericism means you don’t really think coherently enough about your ideas; they get lost and you communicate them too subtly”. It feels like Thiel is keeping both options open. He gets to tap dance between “I said what I said” and “you don’t understand what I’m doing here”. He seems to want to stand apart from his own immense power – apart from his own positions, apart from his own attempts to make himself understood – in something like bemused contemplation.</p><figure id="3c69b6c8-e9a4-4027-98c7-1efbe8cdb919" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.InteractiveAtomBlockElement"><figure data-atom-id="interactives/2024/09/andrew-playground/portrait-black-hack" data-atom-type="interactive-layout"></figure></figure></div></article></div>]]></description>

<p>Some questions are timeless, innocent yet penetrating in their simplicity. Why is the sky blue? Why do things fall? How hard must one hit a chicken to cook it? It is this last mystery of the universe that we discuss today.</p>

<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/physics-major-calculates-how-hard-to-slap-chicken-to-cook-it/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=organic">classic solution</a> in which someone calculated that, if you slap a chicken at 3726 mph, it will be cooked. However, this analysis just calculates how hard you’d have to hit a chicken to get it to cooking temperature; you need to keep it at that temperature for it to cook. One slap won’t work unless you get it so hot that it cooks while it’s cooling.</p>

<p>A real answer to this vital conundrum needs to consider how fast a chicken cools. A body at a nonzero temperature is constantly radiating energy as blackbody radiation; this is what you see in incandescent lightbulbs or when glass glows during glassblowing. To keep an object at a given temperature, you have to continuously give it the same energy it’s radiating away. A typical-sized chicken at 165 F is radiating away roughly 2000 watts of power, around 300 times the power used in a fluorescent lightbulb. To avoid losing any heat to contact with the air, let’s assume we dangle the chicken from a string in a large vacuum chamber. Let’s also assume you and a few friends are hitting the chicken with baseball bats like a pinata. In order to keep the chicken at 165 F for the minutes needed to cook it, it would be enough to have four people each hitting it once a second with a bat swung at 75 mph, about the speed with which a pro swings. Four major-league baseball players wearing pressure suits in a vacuum chamber each hitting a dangling chicken with a baseball bat once a second could cook it in a few minutes.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/10/datacenter_coal_power/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/10/datacenter_coal_power/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45545277">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>US datacenters are experiencing a significant shift toward coal-powered energy due to elevated natural gas prices and rapidly growing electricity demand.</p>
<p>According to a research note from financial services firm Jefferies, datacenter operators are racing to connect new capacity to the electrical grid, with accelerated load growth expected during the 2026-2028 period.</p>
<p>This spike in demand is driving an unexpected resurgence in coal generation, which has increased nearly 20 percent year-to-date. The research note, seen by <em>The Register</em>, states:</p>

    

<p>"We raise our estimate for coal generation by ~11 percent (driven by higher capacity factors), and staying elevated through 2027 on favorable fuel pricing vs gas (particularly for existing fleet).".</p>

        


        

<p>Warnings emerged last year that rising energy demand from the proliferation of data centers in the US risked outstripping available generation capacity, potentially extending the operational life of coal-fired power plants.</p>
<p>In Omaha, one power company <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/14/ai_datacenters_coal/">reversed plans to stop burning coal</a> to produce electricity, citing the need to serve nearby datacenters. The company determined that decommissioning coal-burning generators at the North Omaha power plant would risk power shortages in the district given rising energy requirements from these facilities.</p>

        

<p>This reversal, as <i>The Register</i> reported at the time, carries environmental implications. Continued coal combustion affects local air quality near power plants and hinders broader efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Campaign group Greenpeace has <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/challenges/fossil-fuels/coal/">characterized coal</a> as "the dirtiest, most polluting way of producing energy."</p>
<p>The environmental impact extends globally. A 2024 Morgan Stanley report projected that datacenters will emit 2.5 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases worldwide by 2030 — <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/06/datacenters_set_to_emit_3x/">triple the emissions</a> that would have occurred without the development of generative AI technology.</p>
<p>Natural gas-powered turbine generators had been the favored choice to power the ongoing datacenter build boom, especially as these can be sited directly on campus to provide local generation. However, current gas prices have made this option less economically attractive.</p>

        

<p>As the <i>Financial Times</i> notes in an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/6e4193a0-aaf3-4752-8b45-696eae57ba18" rel="nofollow">article</a> on whether datacenters are a setback for the green energy transition, developers tend to favor power sources that are easily available for their initial build-out.</p>
<p>If operators can get their facility online as soon as possible while securing renewable energy commitments, they will, but the stopgap will be whatever is to hand, and this is likely natural gas or coal.</p>

</ul>
<p>The current federal policy environment presents additional challenges for renewable energy adoption. The Trump administration has implemented measures that affect renewable energy development, including <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/07/ags_sue_trump_wind_energy_freeze/">freezing approval processes for wind energy projects</a> and announcing <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/20/trump-says-us-will-not-approve-solar-or-wind-power-projects.html">restrictions on new solar and wind power projects</a>, with officials citing land use and cost concerns.</p>
<p>This policy direction contrasts with research indicating that renewable energy could <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/26/renewables_vs_smr_datacenter/">power datacenters at lower cost</a> than fossil fuels or emerging technologies such as small modular reactors (SMRs), which are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theregister.com/2025/09/16/small_modular_reactors_2026/">gaining attention</a>, despite being largely untested.</p>
<p>Yet this isn't a consideration for Washington at the moment. Last month, US Interior Secretary Doug Burgum <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/12/fire_up_gas_turbines_ai_race/">told a natural gas industry event</a>: "The real existential threat right now is not a degree of climate change. It's the fact that we could lose the AI arms race if we don't have enough power."</p>
<p>Similarly, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/13/microsoft_natural_gas_ai/">told an energy conference</a> in March: "The Trump administration will treat climate change for what it is, a global physical phenomenon that is a side effect of building the modern world." ®</p>

<p>I’ve been <a href="https://x.com/owickstrom/status/1976247186632683564">hinting</a>
<a href="https://x.com/owickstrom/status/1866979819961135555">on</a> <a href="https://x.com/owickstrom/status/1927349072693694743">X/Twitter</a>
about my use of the Daylight DC-1 as a programming environment, and
after about a year of use, it’s time to write about it in longer form.
This isn’t a full product review, but rather an experience report on
coding in sunlight. It’s also about the Boox Tab Ultra – which has a
different type of display – and how it compares to the DC-1 for my use
cases.</p>
<p>This is <em>not</em> a sponsored post.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://wickstrom.tech/assets/sun-light-mode/daylight-3.webp" alt="Neovim in Termux on the Daylight DC-1.">

</figure>
<p>Why do I even bother, you might ask? Sunlight makes me energetic and
alert, which I need when I work. Living in the Nordics, 50% of the year
is primarily dark, so any direct daylight I can get becomes really
important. I usually run light mode on my Framework laptop during the
day, but working in actual daylight with these displays, or plain old
paper, is even better.</p>
<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>
<p>Here are the main components of this coding environment:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://daylightcomputer.com/product">Daylight DC-1</a>: an
Android-based tablet with a “Live Paper” display (Reflective LCD, not
E-Ink)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-mechanical-keyboard/">8BitDo
Retro Mechanical Keyboard</a>: a mechanical Bluetooth-enabled keyboard,
with Kailh key switches and USB-C charging and optional connection</li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&amp;hl=sv&amp;pli=1">Termux</a>:
a terminal emulator for Android, with a package collection based on
<code>apt</code></li>
<li>SSH, tmux, and Neovim: nothing surprising here</li>
</ul>
<p>I use a slimmed-down version of my <a href="https://github.com/owickstrom/home-manager">regular dotfiles</a>,
because this setup doesn’t use Nix. I’ve manually installed Neovim,
tmux, and a few other essentials, using the package manager that comes
with Termux. I’ve configured Termux to not show its virtual keyboard
when a physical keyboard is connected (the Bluetooth keyboard). The
Termux theme is “E-Ink” and the font is JetBrains Mono, all built into
Termux. Neovim uses the built-in <code>quiet</code> colorscheme for
maximum contrast.</p>
<p>Certain work requires a more capable environment, and in those cases
I connect to my workstation using SSH and run tmux in there. For writing
or simpler programming projects (I’ve even done Rust work with Cargo,
for instance), the local Termux environment is fine.</p>
<p>Sometimes I want to go really minimalist, so I hide the tmux status
bar and run <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim"><code>Goyo</code></a> in
Neovim. <em>Deep breaths. Feel the fresh air in your lungs.</em> This is
especially nice for writing blog posts like this one.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://wickstrom.tech/assets/sun-light-mode/daylight-2.webp" alt="Minimalist typing with Goyo in Neovim.">

</figure>
<p>My blog editing works locally in Termux, with a live reloading Chrome
in a split window, here during an evening writing session with the warm
backlight enabled:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://wickstrom.tech/assets/sun-light-mode/daylight-6.webp" alt="Split-screen blogging locally on the Daylight.">

</figure>
<p>There’s the occasional Bluetooth connection problem with the 8BitDo
keyboard. I also don’t love the layout, and I’m considering getting the
<a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-blue-pc/">Kinesis
Freestyle2 Blue</a> instead. I already have the wired version for my
workstation, and the ergonomics are great.</p>
<h2 id="daylight-dc-1-vs-boox-tab-ultra">Daylight DC-1 vs Boox Tab
Ultra</h2>
<p>What about the Boox? I’ve had this device for longer and I really
like it too, but not for the same tasks. The E-Ink display is, quite
frankly, a lot nicer to read on; EPUB books, research PDFs, web
articles, etc. The 227 PPI instead of the Daylight’s 190 PPI makes a
difference, and I like the look of E-Ink better overall.</p>
<p>However, the refresh rate and ghosting make it a bit frustrating for
typing. Same goes for drawing, which I’ve used the Daylight for a lot.
Most of my home renovation blueprints are sketched on the Daylight. The
refresh rate makes it possible.</p>
<p>When reading at night with a more direct bedside lamp, often in
combination with a subtle backlight, the Boox is much better. The
Daylight screen can glare quite a bit, so the only option is backlight
only. And at that point, a lot of the paperlike quality goes away.</p>
<p>You can also get some glare when there’s direct sunlight at a
particular angle:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://wickstrom.tech/assets/sun-light-mode/daylight-1.webp" alt="You may get glare in direct sunlight or from lamps at some angles.">

</figure>
<p>Even if I don’t write or program directly on the Boox, I’ve
experimented with using it as a secondary display, like for the live
reload blog preview:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://wickstrom.tech/assets/sun-light-mode/boox-1.webp" alt="Using the Boox Tab Ultra as a secondary display by browsing the live reload HTTP server.">

</figure>
<p>To sum up, these devices are good for different things, in my
experience. I’ve probably spent more time on the Boox, because I’ve had
it for longer and I’ve read a lot on it, but the Daylight has been much
better for typing and drawing.</p>
<p>Another thing I’d like to try is a larger E-Ink monitor for my
workstation, like <a href="https://x.com/zack_overflow/status/1952445830541291916">the one
Zack is hacking on</a>. I’m hoping this technology continues to improve
on refresh rate, because I love E-Ink. Until then, the Daylight is a
good compromise.</p>

Pretty good for the first month of production. These watches are being transferred to our fulfillment center and will be shipped out soon.</p><p>Black Pebble 2 Duo production did not start until the end of September, and then got interrupted by a China/Hong Kong holiday. Extremely sorry for the delay on black!</p><p><strong>Pebble Time 2</strong></p><p>One fun piece of Pebble Time 2 software development news - we added a feature to make existing Pebble watchfaces/apps now (optionally) scale up to fill larger and higher resolution Pebble Time 2 display! Previous generation Pebble rectangular displays measured 144x168 pixels in 1.26" diagonal, but Pebble Time 2 is 200x228 pixels in 1.5", existing faces/apps would have had a black border on PT2. Many thanks to Alina for posting <a href="https://discord.com/channels/221364737269694464/256091649996881922/1395517128043401258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this idea on Discord</a>.</p><p><img src="https://ericmigi.com/assets/re-introducing-the-pebble-appstore-1-cleanshot_2025-10-07_at_16.48.452x.png"></p><p>This is fantastic because it will allow <em>all</em> older apps/faces to fill up the whole screen. Even better though, many Pebble developers are already upgrading their apps/faces to support the bigger screen natively, like <a href="https://lignite.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lignite</a>’s beautiful face <a href="https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/application/55386bcd2aead62b16000028?query=mosaic&amp;section=watchfaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mosaic</a>. </p><p><video controls="" preload="metadata" playsinline=""><source src="https://ericmigi.com/assets/re-introducing-the-pebble-appstore-9-pxl_20251001_2309170933.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p><p>Pebble Time 2 <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/pebble-time-2-design-reveal">hardware development</a> is going pretty well.

We’re now aiming to start mass production <em>just</em> around the end of the year (12/26 to be precise). That means December pre-orders will not ship out until January at the earliest. We’ll try our best to catch up, but the other looming date is the start of the lunar new year (factory shuts down Feb 1 through 17). We’ve got our work cut out for us!

These were made by an extraordinarily talented community of casual developers, who primarily built apps for themselves and shared them with the broader public. This was facilitated by a damn good SDK, APIs, devtools and documentation created by the friendly and talented software and devrel teams at Pebble.</p><p>I think the ease of development and hackability of Pebble truly made the world a better place, one little app at a time. I love hearing stories from people who first learned how to program on a free Pebble they got from a hackathon (we gave away thousands this way). <a href="https://developer.repebble.com/blog/2016/05/11/Learning-C-with-Pebble-The-Book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Books</a> were <a href="https://pebble.gitbooks.io/learning-c-with-pebble/content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">written</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU_hPBhgjGQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tools</a> <a href="https://pebble.github.io/pebblejs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were</a> created.

                  Summary:&nbsp;
                </span>iOS 26’s visual language obscures content instead of letting it take the spotlight. New (but not always better) design patterns replace established conventions.
              </p><div>
              <p>With iOS 26, Apple seems to be leaning harder into visual design and decorative UI effects — but at what cost to usability? At first glance, the system looks fluid and modern. But try to use it, and soon those shimmering surfaces and animated controls start to get in the way. Let’s strip back the frost and look at how these changes affect real use.</p>

</div><h2 id="toc-liquid-glass-apples-new-visual-language-1">Liquid Glass: Apple’s New Visual Language</h2>
<p>iOS 26 introduces Apple’s new <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/glassmorphism/">glassmorphic</a> visual language into its phones.</p>
<p>Apple describes Liquid Glass as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“a translucent material that reflects and refracts its surroundings, while dynamically transforming to help bring greater focus to content, delivering a new level of vitality across controls, navigation, app icons, widgets, and more.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translated: the interface now ripples and shimmers as if your phone were encased in Jell-O. At first glance, it does look cool. But problems arise as soon as you start using your phone.</p>
<h3>Transparency = Hard to See</h3>
<p>Liquid Glass makes UI elements translucent and bubbly. The result is light, airy — and often invisible.</p>
<p>One of the oldest findings in usability is that anything placed on top of something else becomes harder to see. Yet here we are, in 2025, with Apple proudly obscuring text, icons, and controls by making them transparent and placing them on top of busy backgrounds.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/text-over-images/">Text on top of images</a> is a bad idea</strong> because the contrast between the text and the background is often too low. So <em>why</em> does Apple now encourage users to set photos as backgrounds for text messages?</p>
<figure><img alt="Text messages of butterflies placed over a background of a rabbit, making it hard to decipher any image. " height="761" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/1-messages-img_2023.PNG" width="350">
<figcaption><em>Apple Messages: iOS 26 encourages users to choose a background image for text messages. Doing so makes it substantially harder to read the text or easily notice other content, such as photos. Or even discover the input field (not to speak of the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-placeholders/">in-field placeholder</a> </em>iMessage).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The result is that your friend’s words are camouflaged against their beach-vacation photo, or worse, their pet’s fur. Content may technically be “in focus,” but you can’t read (or see) it.</p>
<figure><img alt="Icons at the bottom of a restaurant page on Apple Maps blend into the background images of food. " height="761" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/2-maps.PNG" width="350">
<figcaption><em>Apple Maps: Icons at the bottom of the screen blend in with the images in the background, despite the blurring of the background.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And then comes Apple’s boldest (or dumbest) experiment: <strong>text on top of text. </strong>Apparently, designers decided users have eagle vision and infinite patience, because deciphering one line of text written across another is now fair game. Reading an email subject line now requires Dan Brown-level cryptographic decoder skills.</p>
<p>Not only is it illegible — it’s also ugly.</p>
<figure><img alt="The search bar on the Mail app blends into the previews for other emails. " height="254" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/3-mail.PNG" width="350">
<figcaption>&nbsp;<em>Mail: Text on top of text creates an illegible mess.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Semitransparent floating controls reign in iOS 26. Titles, search bars, tab bars, and even the phone status bar are now floating on top of the page. These not only obscure the page content, but also sometimes compete for attention with other page elements.</p>
<figure><img alt="The controls on Safari now blend in with the page content on Illinois Tolls." height="761" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/4-illinois.PNG" width="350">
<figcaption><em>Safari: The browser’s floating controls (URL bar, back button, ellipsis menu) now compete for attention with in-page floating buttons. And the phone's ​​​​​status bar interferes with in-page content.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Animated Buttons: Motion Without Meaning</h3>
<p>Animation can be delightful the first time. When used intentionally, they can also be satisfying — creating that feeling when something just “clicks” or “snaps” into place. Our eyes are finely tuned to detect motion, which is why animated buttons grab attention instantly. But delight turns into distraction on the tenth, twentieth, or hundredth time.</p>
<p>In iOS 26, controls insist on animating themselves, whether or not the user benefits. Carousel dots quietly morph into the word <em>Search</em> after a few seconds. Camera buttons jerk slightly when tapped. Tab bars bubble and wiggle when switching views, and buttons briefly pulsate before being replaced with something else entirely. <strong>It’s like the interface is shouting “look at me” when it should quietly step aside and let the real star — the content — take the spotlight.</strong></p>
<figure><img alt="On an iPhone homescreen, the search bar and carousel dots transform into each other as the user scrolls. " height="762" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/homescreen.gif" width="350">
<figcaption><em>Homescreen: The carousel dots change into a search bar.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img alt="When selecting tabs on the phone app, the selected tab shimmers and wiggles in a bubble." height="106" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/voicemail.gif" width="350">
<figcaption><em>Tabs shimmer, bubble, and wiggle when switched.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img alt="When selecting a button in the Contacts app, the button pulse and wiggle to indicate selection." height="194" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/contacts.gif" width="350">
<figcaption><em>Buttons pulsate when selected.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Even controls you didn’t touch can’t resist showing off. In the Phone app, switching from <em>All Calls</em> to <em>Missed Calls</em> mysteriously turns the filter button blue, as though missed calls deserve filtering but all calls don’t.</p>
<figure><img alt="When switching to a tab that also filters selections, the filter button turns blue, although it wasn't selected." height="212" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/phone-filter.gif" width="350">
<figcaption><em>Phone: Switching from </em>All<em> to </em>Missed Calls<em> turns the filter button blue, likely to indicate that a filter was applied and only some calls — the missed ones — are visible. The intention is good, but the change of color is unnecessary and distracting, given the selected state of the segmented control</em> Missed<em> at the top. Or perhaps the designers were afraid that the selected state was too subtle?</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Music app, the current song title ticks along like a stock-market ticker, shimmering with watery highlights as you scroll up and down. Reach the top of the page and — surprise! — the bubble leaps up to make space for the tab bar<strong>. </strong></p>
<figure><img alt="As the user scrolls down, the pill with the song title jumps up and a tab bar slides under it. " height="762" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/music.gif" width="350">
<figcaption><em>Apple Music: The song title ticks and shimmers, and jumps up to make room for the tab bar when the user scrolls up to the top of the page.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Motion for motion’s sake is not usability. It’s distraction with a side of nausea.</p>
<h2 id="toc-crowded-smaller-tap-targets-2">Crowded, Smaller Tap Targets</h2>
<p>Apple has also decided it’s time to crowd and shrink touch targets. The long‑standing guideline of at least 0.4cm between targets (and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/touch-target-size/">1cm × 1cm tap areas</a>) seems to have been tossed out the window. Either <strong>Apple believes our fingers are getting smaller, </strong>or it assumes years of practice with smartphones have magically trained us to hit tiny targets with perfect precision.</p>
<figure><img alt="Comparison between the photos app in different iOSs'. The older one's controls are spaced further apart. " height="718" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/photos.png" width="692">
<figcaption><em>Photos: In iOS 18 (left)&nbsp; controls are much farther apart than in iOS 26 (right).</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In iOS 26, tab bars show the results of this thinking: they feel cramped, squeezed to make room for the ever present search button that lingers in the bottom‑right corner of nearly every page.</p>
<figure><img alt="Comparison between the app store in the old and new iOS design. The new iOS visually splits the search into a seperate pill pushing the other icons closer together." height="730" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/app-store.png" width="692">
<figcaption><em>App Store in iOS 18 vs iOS 26: In iOS 26 (right) the tab bar at the bottom of app pages has become split between navigation and search — with search taking a larger space and navigation categories being crammed into each other.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Because this button hovers apart from the rest of the bar, navigation feels fragmented. One control floats off on its own while the others are bunched together, breaking the sense of a unified control area and making the whole bar harder to scan at a glance. <strong>The heavy emphasis on search feels borrowed from Google’s playbook,</strong> which is ironic given Apple’s reputation for building its own distinct design language.</p>
<h2 id="toc-predictability-lost-3">Predictability, Lost</h2>
<p>We’ve long known that constantly changing interfaces are a nightmare. Back in the day, Microsoft Office experimented with adaptive menus that reordered themselves based on recency. People hated them because nothing stayed where you left it. You had to rescan the menu every single time. The interface could not be learned because it was constantly changing.</p>
<p>Apple seems to have learned nothing from that lesson. In iOS 26, controls appear, vanish, collapse, and expand depending on context. The tab bar collapses whenever search is activated, making room for the field.</p>
<figure><img alt="When the search bar is clicked, the bar with the tabs &quot;summary&quot; and &quot;sharing&quot; shrink into a single icon. " height="762" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/health-nav-bar.gif" width="350">
<figcaption><em>Health: The tab bar collapses whenever the search box is expanded.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Safari adds its own twist: the forward button appears and disappears depending on whether there is a page to go forward to. While this may seem logical in theory, in practice it disrupts consistency: changing the size and location of a target makes the interface harder to learn and less predictable.</p>
<figure><img alt="Two screenshots of the new Safari design. In one image there is only a back button, the second image features both a back and forward button in the controls. " height="729" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/safari-forward.PNG" width="692">
<figcaption><em>Safari: The browser toolbar sometimes contains only a back button (left), and sometimes it also includes a forward button (right).</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Instead of building reliable habits, users now have to play hide-and-seek with the navigation controls.</p>
<h2 id="toc-changing-conventions-4">Changing Conventions</h2>
<p>Search in earlier versions of iOS lived at the top of the page. In Mail or Messages, users had to scroll down to reveal the bar. It wasn’t the most discoverable pattern, but years of repetition made it second nature.</p>
<figure><img alt="A screenshot showing the old iOS design. It shows that the search bar was hidden by default, but would appear at the top if the user scrolled up." height="714" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/messages-ios18.PNG" width="692">
<figcaption><em>Messages (iOS 18): Search was hidden by default (left). To access it, users had to “pull down” the top of the page (right).</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, in iOS 26, search has migrated to the bottom of the screen and is always visible. For newcomers this might feel easier to find, but for long‑time users it’s a jarring break from habit that slows them down until the new pattern becomes ingrained. (Even if the new pattern might prove beneficial over time, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/power-law-learning/">existing users must relearn it</a>, which in the short run means lost productivity and added frustration.)</p>
<figure><img alt="Comparison of the old and new iOS designs. In the old one, the search bar is at the top. The new one has it at the bottom." height="740" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/settings-search.PNG" width="698">
<figcaption><em>Settings app: Search is at the top in iOS 18 (left) and at the bottom in iOS 26 (right).</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To complicate matters further, search is styled as a floating bar that sometimes interferes with page content. Its pale design also tends to fade into the background, making it easy to miss. In our past research on floating buttons, we found they work best when they stand out clearly — not when they blend in and risk being overlooked.</p>
<h2 id="toc-discoverability-in-decline-5">Discoverability in Decline</h2>
<p>The back button, once a friendly guide accompanied by a breadcrumb, has lost its trail. Instead of showing where you came from, it has no label now, leaving users to guess.</p>
<figure><img alt="Comparison of the old and new iOS. In the old one, the back button was a blue back arrow with &quot;Settings&quot; written beside it. In the new one, it is just a black-and-white back arrow icon." height="717" loading="lazy" src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2025/10/06/settings-general.PNG" width="692">
<figcaption><em>Settings: The back button used to have a breadcrumb next to it, indicating the page the user came from (left). In iOS 26 (right), that label has been removed.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This signals another transition (this time for the worse) to Android-style design, where page titles are left-aligned (instead of center-aligned), thus displacing the breadcrumb next to the back button. This design choice has the potential to cause major confusion for users, as some apps will still use a breadcrumb next to the back button, while others may replace the breadcrumb with the current-page title.</p>

<p>Safari piles on with its own frustrations: the URL bar is squeezed between icons, truncated to the point where you can’t easily tell what site you’re on. And tabs, once a single tap away, are now hidden in an overflow ellipsis menu that demands extra steps. Not only does this design violate best practices for overflow menu (which requires that only nonessential actions be hidden there), but every additional tap is another second wasted — multiplied by the millions of times users switch tabs each day.</p>

<p>iOS 26 brings Liquid Glass controls laid over noisy backgrounds, jittery animated buttons, shrunken and crowded tab bars, collapsing navigation, and ubiquitous search bars. On top of that, it breaks long‑established iOS conventions, getting closer to Android design.</p>
<p><strong>Overall, Apple is prioritizing spectacle over usability</strong>, lending credibility to the theory that Liquid Glass is an attempt to distract customers from iOS 26’s lack of long-promised AI features.</p>
<p>The interface is restless, needy, less predictable, less legible, and constantly pulling focus rather than supporting seamless access to content. Instead of smoothing the path for everyday tasks, iOS 26 makes users relearn basics while enduring a constant parade of visual stunts.</p>
<p>Apple may call it Liquid Glass. To many users, it feels more like a fogged‑up window: pretty from a distance, but frustrating when you try to see beyond it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
          <p><a href="https://tangled.sh/" rel="nofollow">Tangled</a> is a new social-enabled Git collaboration
platform, built on top of the <a href="https://atproto.com/" rel="nofollow">AT Protocol</a>. We
envision a place where developers have complete ownership of their code,
open source communities can freely self-govern and most importantly,
coding can be social and fun again.</p>

<p>There are several models for decentralized code collaboration platforms,
ranging from ActivityPub’s (Forgejo) federated model, to Radicle’s
entirely P2P model. Our approach attempts to be the best of both worlds
by adopting atproto—a protocol for building decentralized social
applications with a central identity.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.tangled.org/static/img/arch.svg" alt="tangled architecture"></p>

<p>Our approach to this is the idea of “knots”. Knots are lightweight,
headless servers that enable users to host Git repositories with ease.
Knots are designed for either single or multi-tenant use which is
perfect for self-hosting on a Raspberry Pi at home, or larger
“community” servers. By default, Tangled provides managed knots where
you can host your repositories for free.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/federation-architecture#app-views" rel="nofollow">App View</a> at <a href="https://tangled.sh/" rel="nofollow">tangled.sh</a> acts as a
consolidated “view” into the whole network, allowing users to access,
clone and contribute to repositories hosted across different knots—completely seamlessly.</p>

<p>Tangled is still in its infancy, and we’re building out several of its
core features as we <a href="https://tangled.sh/@tangled.sh/core" rel="nofollow">dogfood it ourselves</a>. We developed these
three tenets to guide our decisions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ownership of data</li>
<li>Low barrier to entry</li>
<li>No compromise on user-experience</li>
</ol>

<p>Collaborating on code isn’t easy, and the tools and workflows we use
should feel natural and stay out of the way. Tangled’s architecture
enables common workflows to work as you’d expect, all while remaining
decentralized.</p>

<p>We believe that atproto has greatly simplfied one of the hardest parts
of social media: having your friends on it. Today, we’re rolling out
invite-only access to Tangled—join us on IRC at <code>#tangled</code> on
<a href="https://libera.chat/" rel="nofollow">libera.chat</a> and we’ll get you set up.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Tangled is open to public, simply login at
<a href="https://tangled.sh/login" rel="nofollow">tangled.sh/login</a>! Have fun!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://fulghum.io/album-cards">https://fulghum.io/album-cards</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45543475">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    
    <p>by <a href="https://fulghum.io/">Jordan Fulghum</a>, October 2025</p>
    
    <p><em>Albums you can hold again.</em></p>

    <p>When I was 10, I blew every dollar I had on CDs. I remember sitting cross-legged on my floor, flipping through jewel cases, memorizing liner notes and lyrics, and most importantly developing my own taste for music.</p>
    
    <p>My 10-year-old doesn't have that. Music just sort of... happens. It's like it's infinite and invisible at the same time, playing from smart speakers, car stereos, my phone. Endless perfectly curated playlists, designed to fade into the background. The default listening experience has become both literally and figuratively formless.</p>

    <p>So I thought: what's the modern equivalent of that CD browsing experience? Maybe what's missing is something tangible that he can flip through, or even collect.</p>

    <p>I could combine my old CD-collector brain with today's tech: take something fun and collectable (trading cards), dress them up with album art, and add NFC tags so they can be tapped to play the album on our home speaker system, all without a screen.</p>

    <p>Away I went.</p>

    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/album-cards-hand.jpeg" alt="Handful of album cards"></p><p>The finished product. Pick a card, any card.</p>
    </div>





    <h2>The Setup</h2>

    <p>I needed to get the music into a format that could be played. I've long since surrendered to streaming, but I still have my MP3s organized via <a href="https://plex.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plex</a> on my home server. Funny to think that these files are the same MP3s that I've been collecting since the late 90s. I wanted the NFC tag to be deep-linked to those same files instead of a streaming service.</p>

    <p>But which albums do I pick? I had the idea to create themed "packs" of albums. The first pack is obviously "Albums That Dad Wants You to Listen To", and it's just a bunch of dad rock. But the idea is that each pack can be a different theme or genre, and he can build his own collection (and develop his own taste) over time. </p>

    <h2>Making em</h2>

    <p>I found a PDF template that matched the dimensions of trading cards, hopped into <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canva</a> and got to work. It was easy enough to find high-quality album cover images from Google, but....</p>


    <h3>The Aspect Ratio Goof</h3>

    <p>I was quite far into this project when I remembered the obvious fact that album art is square but trading cards are rectangular. Trading cards use a 2.5:3.5 aspect ratio, which is...not a square! Oops.</p>

    <p>I looked at what they did for cassette tapes (also rectangular) back in the day, but their solutions were all over the place, from just cropping the square into a rectangle (gross) to having a giant white space next to the square art. That wasn't gonna cut it.</p>

    <p>So, I used an AI diffusion model to extend each album's art into a trading card aspect ratio. The AI was (mostly) able to extend the artwork while maintaining the original style and composition. Not perfect, but a pretty fun solution not possible just a couple years ago.</p>
    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/album-cards-printable.png" alt="Printable template showing how to create your own album cards"></p><p>I used AI to extend the album art to the trading card aspect ratio. Highlighted are the generated parts of the artwork, including the Marina City Towers which tripped up the model quite a bit, surprisingly. For <em>Nevermind</em>, I just dropped in a solid blue, color-matched rectangle. Take that, AI.</p>
    </div>

    <p>After ordering a bundle of blank NFC tags from Amazon, I learned that <a href="https://plexamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlexAmp</a> oddly has first-class support for zapping NFC tags to specific albums in auto play mode. A strange feature, but perfect for this project. Easy.</p>

    <p>I printed the cards on our crappy HP inkjet printer at home. I used label paper that exactly matched the dimensions of trading cards, but after the fact, I realized it was kind of unnecessary. You can just print on cardstock if you have a digital template file.  I cut them out and glued them to blank playing cards, but not before wedging the NFC tags between.</p>
    <video controls="" preload="metadata" playsinline="" width="640"><source src="https://fulghum.io/album-cards-printing.mp4"></video>



    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/album-cards-beck.jpeg" alt="Beck album card showing the detailed artwork"></p><p>The grass on the lower-third of this card is not naturally occurring.</p>
    </div>

    <p>For placement, I found a trading card display model from <a href="https://makerworld.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Makerworld</a> and 3D printed it on my <a href="https://bambulab.com/en-us/a1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A1</a>. It turned out alright!</p>
    <video controls="" preload="metadata" playsinline="" width="640"><source src="https://fulghum.io/album-cards-3d-print.mp4"></video>


    <p>Once it was all working and in decent shape, I presented them in a nice neat arrangement to my son. He flipped through them like Pokémon cards, examined the cards that were the most visually interesting. Daft Punk's <em>Discovery</em> was his first pick. He grabbed it, flipped it around, tapped it, and that <em>One More Time</em> loop dropped throughout our entire house. Boom.</p>
    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/album-cards-display.jpeg" alt="Album cards displayed on a table showing various album covers"></p><p>Don't look too closely at the corners, oof.</p>
    </div>

    <p>I was happy to see that the physical cards encouraged active listening and ownership. Instead of music being background noise, it became something he could choose, hold, explore, maybe even trade with this sister!</p>

    <video controls="" preload="metadata" playsinline="" width="640"><source src="https://fulghum.io/album-cards-nevermind.mp4"></video>
    <p>It was all worth it for her reaction. And yes, I know she's just giddy about the naked baby.</p>


    <p>I think we're unintentionally teaching our children to consume music passively. My goal with this project was to teach them to discover it actively, to own it, to care about it at the album level. I think it kinda worked!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://orb.net/blog/does-speed-make-wifi-suck">https://orb.net/blog/does-speed-make-wifi-suck</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45542444">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!----><p>It is common knowledge among Wi-Fi professionals that using 20 MHz or 40 MHz channel widths when planning 5 GHz networks offers the best overall experience for enterprise networks. This is because enterprise networks can often cover large footprints and need higher density for many connected devices. Using narrower channel widths provides many more available channels for building out networks with appropriate channel reuse and allows flexibility to avoid co-channel interference from noisy neighbors.</p>
<figure>
					<img src="https://orbweb.directus.app/assets/89354a8e-9c42-4379-b683-68ba031b678e" alt="Available 20 MHz-wide 5 GHz channels" title="">

					<figcaption>Available 80 MHz-wide 5 GHz channels (source: <a href="https://spectrum.potatofi.com/">PotatoFi</a>)</figcaption>
				</figure>
<p>Residential and small business Wi-Fi challenges are not so different. The average US household has 21 Wi-Fi devices<sup>1</sup>. Many homes require multiple mesh nodes or access points to cover effectively. Users in dense urban areas face many nearby access points using wide channels. Although Wi-Fi networks built by seasoned professionals typically use narrower channels, consumer Wi-Fi devices from popular manufacturers and ISPs utilize 80 MHz or wider channel widths by default. Popular routers and mesh systems from large manufacturers can even default to 40 MHz channels for 2.4 GHz networks (some not even allowing you to change to 20 MHz), utilizing two-thirds of the available spectrum!</p>
<p>Why? Because consumers have been conditioned to understand only raw speed as a metric of Wi-Fi <em>quality</em> and not more important indicators of internet experience such as responsiveness and reliability. If manufacturers shipped Wi-Fi routers and mesh systems that utilized more reasonable 40 MHz-wide 5 GHz channels out of the box, consumers would return the products when their favorite speed testing tool showed no improvement in speed over their previous system. Similarly, ISPs are reluctant to configure consumer premise equipment (CPE) to use narrower channels by default to reduce adjacent-channel and co-channel interference, as this will decrease the maximum achieved speed and hurt their standings in network performance benchmarks that emphasize raw speed over a rock solid and consistent Wi-Fi experience.</p>
<h2>But wait. It gets worse.</h2>
<p>Not only does consumer and telecoms marketing’s heavy focus on speed hamstring ISPs and device manufacturers when it comes to delivering excellent in-home Wi-Fi, but the very act of performing speed tests negatively impacts experience.</p>
<p>For example, here is a 1-minute summary of an iPhone’s responsiveness connected to a Wi-Fi 6 router connected directly to a symmetrical 1 Gbps fiber connection.  </p>
<figure>
					<img src="https://orbweb.directus.app/assets/29027f1c-8b86-450e-8d35-754e1760eab1" alt="Orb 1-minute Wi-Fi Responsiveness view, idle network" title="">
					<figcaption>Orb 1-minute Wi-Fi Responsiveness view, idle network</figcaption>
				</figure>
<p>Now, an important concept in Wi-Fi is that of airtime contention: basically, only a single device can “talk” at a time on a given channel<sup>2</sup>. So if one device is generating a considerable amount of unnecessary traffic, say from taking an internet speed test, substantial airtime contention occurs. Let’s connect a laptop to the same Wi-Fi router, take an internet speed test, and observe the impact on responsiveness from the same iPhone:</p>
<figure>
					<img src="https://orbweb.directus.app/assets/77b6e3b3-fbad-4532-8333-b615c21137b4" alt="Orb 1-minute Wi-Fi Responsiveness view, active speed test by second Wi-Fi client" title="">
					<figcaption>Orb 1-minute Wi-Fi Responsiveness view, active speed test by second Wi-Fi client</figcaption>
				</figure>
<p>We can see material increases in latency, jitter, and packet loss, resulting in a doubling of the effective Lag. Of course, this does not prove that airtime contention is the cause, as there may be other factors such as buffer bloat. So let’s have the laptop perform the speed test via a wired connection instead of Wi-Fi:  </p>
<figure>
					<img src="https://orbweb.directus.app/assets/5cb2abf0-6ab6-4786-95f9-0284c24ffa12" alt="Orb 1-minute Wi-Fi Responsiveness view, active speed test by ethernet client" title="">
					<figcaption>Orb 1-minute Wi-Fi Responsiveness view, active speed test by ethernet client</figcaption>
				</figure>
<p>This resulted in no material impact compared to the idle state, demonstrating that the speed testing activity was in fact the cause of the degraded experience from airtime contention and other Wi-Fi factors. In fact, the router is running FQ_Codel to mitigate non-Wi-Fi variables. With FQ_Codel disabled, the combined airtime contention and buffer bloat results in even greater degradation of experience when running a speed test: 1.5% packet loss, 13 ms jitter, and 113 ms peak lag. Considering the majority of consumer-grade equipment does not ship with buffer bloat mitigations enabled, this more accurately represents the general consumer Wi-Fi experience when an internet speed test is active.</p>
<figure>
					<img src="https://orbweb.directus.app/assets/739d2561-bcd4-400f-a06d-35fd2e55130a" alt="This is your Wi-Fi on speed tests" title="">
					<figcaption>Consumer Wi-Fi 6 router with default configuration. Orb client: iPhone 13 Pro Max. Speed test client: MacBook Pro M1. FQ_Codel enabled except where noted otherwise.</figcaption>
				</figure>
<p>Many ISPs, device manufacturers, and consumers automate periodic, high-intensity speed tests that negatively impact the consumer internet experience as demonstrated. Further, static probes that connect to Wi-Fi networks to measure maximum throughput are contributing to both buffer bloat <em>and</em> airtime contention.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>18% of US households experienced Wi-Fi issues on a daily basis, 20% on a weekly basis, and 68% reported issues in the past year<sup>3</sup>. But until consumers, the press, and industry understand that responsiveness and reliability are the largest drivers of their Wi-Fi experience, not speed, there will be little appetite from device manufacturers and ISPs to focus on solutions that result in truly great home Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>The IEEE 802.11bn (Wi-Fi 8) working group has acknowledged the need for a shift in focus, framing the standard’s goals differently from past generations: not chasing ever-higher peak speeds, but improving reliability, lower latency (especially at the 95th percentile), reduced packet loss, and robustness under challenging conditions (interference, mobility).</p>
<p>That said, the standard is not projected to be finalized until 2028. Near-term, the availability of Wi-Fi bands in the 6 GHz range will also help provide an even better balance of speed, responsiveness, and reliability with the ability to use wider bands while minimizing co-channel interference. However, this only offers another “lane” and does not eliminate the inherent problem of data-hungry devices cannibalizing precious air time. And, as analysis from Opensignal in conjunction with Hamina Founder &amp; CEO Jussi Kiviniemi demonstrates, 6 GHz penetration remains low due to network and user equipment lagging behind on Wi-Fi 6E and 7 adoption.</p>

				</figure>
<p>We don’t have to wait until there is material Wi-Fi 6E and 7 penetration (or the unrealized promises of Wi-Fi 8) in the market to make progress—we can do so much better with the hardware already deployed with configuration changes if we can simply stop chasing the maximum possible throughputs and instead focus on Wi-Fi responsiveness and reliability.</p>
<p>So, are standard internet speed tests <em>bad</em>? Of course not! They are a tool, and when used for an appropriate task, such as validating provisioned speeds are achievable by a network or client, they are incredibly useful. But we tend to over-use speed testing tools for all connectivity-related troubleshooting activities due to a historical lack of available user-friendly utilities and industry focus on "megabits per second".</p>
<p>This isn’t a matter of education: consumers know they want responsive and reliable Wi-Fi networks for the use cases of today. Instead, we need tooling and data to show consumers the metrics they care about most in an easily digestible form and make them readily available. Modern monitoring tools that measure continuous network experience—not just point-in-time speed—give manufacturers and ISPs the opportunity to compete on metrics that actually improve Wi-Fi rather than degrade it.</p>

The scheduler also introduces overhead. And, as we will show, adoption of newer standards is low.<br><sup>3</sup><a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/wi-fi-connectivity-problems-persist-for-two-thirds-of-americans-survey/">TechSee data via Telecompetitor, September 2025</a></p>

<p><a href="https://electrek.co/guides/toyota/">Toyota</a> is doubling down on the “holy grail” of EV tech — all-solid-state batteries. Its first EV could arrive as soon as 2027, promising longer driving range, faster charging times, and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-toyota-to-launch-its-first-all-solid-state-battery-ev-in-2027">Toyota to launch its first all-solid-state battery EV in 2027</h2>



<p>After announcing a new partnership with Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. to mass produce cathode materials for the new battery tech on Wednesday, Toyota said it aims “to achieve the world’s first practical use of all-solid-state batteries in BEVs.”</p>



<p>Toyota said that its new batteries could significantly enhance driving range, charging times, and output, potentially transforming the future of automobiles.</p>



<p>Compared to current liquid-based batteries, which use electrolyte solutions, Toyota’s all-solid-state batteries utilize a cathode, an anode, and a solid electrolyte. According to Toyota, the next-gen battery tech “offers the potential for smaller size, higher output, and longer life.”</p>	
	



<p>Toyota aims to launch its first all-solid-state battery-powered EV in 2027 or 2028. The new <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/43380876.html">development agreement</a> moves it one step closer to bringing the new battery tech to market on a mass scale.</p>






<p>The two companies have been developing cathode materials for all-solid-state EV batteries since 2021, focusing on some of the biggest challenges in producing them at a mass scale.</p>



<p>Using Sumitomo Metal Mining’s proprietary powder synthesis technology, Toyota claimed to have developed a “highly durable cathode material” for all-solid-state batteries.</p>

<p>Sumitomo has been supplying cathode materials for electric vehicles for years, but it’s now working to introduce the newly developed tech, moving it toward mass production.</p>



<p>The new agreement comes after Toyota was <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/09/09/toyotas-all-solid-state-ev-battery-plans-get-green-light-japan/">granted a METI certification</a> to manufacture the new batteries in Japan last September.</p>

<p>Toyota is collaborating with several partners in Japan, including oil giant Idemitsu Kosan, to introduce the new EV batteries to the market.</p>



<p>Idemitsu <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/27/toyotas-all-solid-state-ev-batteries-just-got-a-lift/">announced plans</a> earlier this year to build a large-scale production plant for lithium sulfide, a raw material used in all-solid-state EV batteries. Once up and running, the plant will be capable of producing 1,000 metric tons of lithium sulfide annually. The company is also aiming to mass-produce all-solid-state batteries in 2027.</p>

<p>The new batteries are part of Japan’s plans to secure a domestic supply chain and reduce its reliance on China and South Korea. Toyota is among several companies in Japan that are investing a combined $7 billion (1 trillion yen) in domestic battery production.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>Will Toyota be the “world’s first” to put all-solid-state EV batteries to practical use? Others, including Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volkswagen, and Honda, are also betting on the new technology.</p>



<p>Mercedes <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/24/mercedes-tests-first-solid-state-battery-ev-with-621-miles-range/">claimed to have</a> put “the first car powered by a lithium-metal solid-state battery on the road” in February. Just last month, Mercedes drove an EQS, equipped with solid-state batteries, for <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/09/09/mercedes-eqs-with-solid-state-ev-batteries-drove-750-miles/">nearly 750 miles</a> (1,205 km).</p>




	<p>Mercedes’ tech boss, Markus Schäfer, is already calling the new EV battery tech a “gamechanger” for electric vehicles. The company aims to bring solid-state batteries into series production by the end of the decade.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, CATL and BYD, which are already dominating the global battery market, aim to introduce the new battery tech around 2027.</p>



<p>SAIC MG <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/29/first-ev-semi-solid-state-battery-launches-for-15000/">launched the new MG4</a> in August, deeming it “the world’s first mass-produced semi-solid-state” electric vehicle.</p>



<p>Can Toyota compete? It has been promising to launch all-solid-state batteries for years now, but new alliances could help make it a reality. As for the “world’s first,” however, that may be a stretch.</p>

<p>Here’s another blog post on gathering some common threads from reading recent posts. Today’s topic is about the unassuming nature of talented software engineers.</p>



<p>The first thread was a <a href="https://x.com/mitchellh/status/1968042802782375978">tweet by Mitchell Hashimoto</a> about how his best former colleagues are ones where you would have no signal about their skills based on their online activities or their working hours.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>One of the most impressive people I've ever worked with was a guy who spent a decade prior working on the same team at the same company iterating on a kernel driver for a single specific network card. He clocked in at 9 and out at 5. Predictable promotions. Nothing crazy.</p><p>During…</p></div>— Mitchell Hashimoto (@mitchellh) <a href="https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/1968042802782375978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The second thread was a blog post written a week later by Nikunj Kothari titled <a href="https://writing.nikunjk.com/p/the-quiet-ones">The Quiet Ones: Working within the seams</a>.  In this post, Kothari wasn’t writing about a specific engineer per se, but rather a type of engineer, one whose contributions aren’t captured by the organization’s performance rubric (emphasis mine):</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They don’t hit your L5 requirements because they’re doing L3 and L7 work simultaneously. Fixing the deploy pipeline while mentoring juniors. Answering customer emails while rebuilding core systems. <strong>They can’t be ranked because they do what nobody thought to measure.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The third thread was a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7381615884282462209?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A%28urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7381615884282462209%2CFEED_DETAIL%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse%29">LinkedIn post written yesterday by Gergly Orosz</a> (emphasis mine).</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One of the best staff-level engineers I worked with is on the market. <br>…<br>What you need to know about this person: every team he’s ever worked on, he did standout work, in every situation. He got stuff done with high quality, helped others, is not argumentative but is firm in holding up common sense and practicality, and is very curious and humble to top all of this off.<br>…<br><strong>And still, from the outside, this engineer is near completely invisible.</strong></p>



<p>He has no social media footprint. His LinkedIn lists his companies he worked at, and nothing else: no technologies, no projects, nothing. His GitHub is empty for the last 5 years, and has perhaps a dozen commits throughout the last 10.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That reason that Mitchell Hashimoto, NIkunj Kothari, and Gergly Orosz were able to identify these talented colleagues as because they worked directly with them. People making hiring decisions don’t have that luxury. For promotions, there are organizational constraints that push organizations to define a formal process with explicit criteria.</p>



<p>For both hiring and promotion, decision-makers have a <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">legibility</a> problem. This problem will inevitability lead to a focus on details that are easier to observe directly <em>precisely because they are easier to observe directly</em>. This is how fields like <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphology">graphology</a> </em>and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology">phrenology</a></em> come about. But just because we can directly observe someone’s handwriting or the shapes of the bumps on their head doesn’t mean that those are effective techniques for learning something about that person’s personality. </p>



<p>I think it’s unlikely the industry will get much better at identifying and evaluating candidates anytime soon. And so I’m sure we’ll continue to see posts about the importance of your LinkedIn profile, or your GitHub, or your <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewfennell/2025/07/23/from-side-hustle-to-paycheck-why-employers-are-hiring-you-for-your-passion-projects-in-2025/">passion project</a>. But you neglect at your peril the engineers who are working nine-to-five days at boring companies.</p>

<p>Welcome back to This Week in Stratechery!</p>



<p>As a reminder, each week, every Friday, we’re sending out this overview of content in the Stratechery bundle; <span>highlighted links are free for everyone</span>. Additionally, you have complete control over what we send to you. If you don’t want to receive This Week in Stratechery emails (there is no podcast), please uncheck the box in <a href="https://stratechery.passport.online/member/account/delivery">your delivery settings</a>.</p>



<p>On that note, here were a few of our favorites this week.</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>OpenAI’s Windows Strategy</strong>. The current touchpoint for platform power is the smartphone, where Apple and Google share a duopoly. <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/openais-windows-play/" data-type="post" data-id="17191"><span>A better analogy for OpenAI’s ambitions, however, is Microsoft and the way that Windows controlled the PC industry</span></a>: platform power didn’t just come from controlling applications on top of Windows, but the OEM ecosystem underneath. If OpenAI builds AI for everyone, then they are positioned to extract margin from companies up-and-down the stack — even Nvidia. And, as a necessary bonus, they position themselves to be the primary recipient of all of the speculative investment in AI, thus making the newly promised $1 trillion of infrastructure deals a reality. <em>—</em> <em>Ben Thompson</em></li>
</ol>



<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Sam Altman and Boundless Ambition. </strong><a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/an-interview-with-openai-ceo-sam-altman-about-devday-and-the-ai-buildout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>This week’s Stratechery Interview with Sam Altman</span></a> was shorter than most (40 minutes) but dense with thought-provoking&nbsp;answers on OpenAI’s business, including about 10 different thoughts from Ben and Altman that could have turned into hour-long conversations of their own. Specifically, though, in the midst of daily hand wringing&nbsp;over whether today’s AI investing is&nbsp;rational, it was clarifying to hear from the CEO at the center of all the frothiness, as the story of the moment is actually quite simple: Altman sees once-in-a-lifetime opportunities in both the consumer and enterprise spaces (“it’s not like you use Google at home and a different company at work”), and given the progress he sees on the research side and where he expects models to be in the near future, OpenAI is placing “company scale” bets today to ensure they have infrastructure ready for tomorrow’s demand. Whether those bets pay off, and how, are questions that will occupy the entire tech ecosystem for the next several years.&nbsp;<em>—</em> <em>Andrew Sharp</em></li>



<li><strong>The Future of Creation.</strong> We’re one week out from Sora madness, and I enjoyed Ben’s Article on Monday <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/sora-ai-bicycles-and-meta-disruption/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>comparing the underwhelming reception of MetaAI’s Vibes update with the rapturous adoption of Sora</span></a>. What I found most interesting about Sora is that for the first few days after joining I could not spend more than two minutes in the app before getting sick of the content (one can only handle so many Sam Altman cameos and/or Pikachu movie parodies). By the weekend, though,&nbsp;I’d learned how to make videos starring my dog, Ollie, and then <a href="https://substack.com/@sinocism/note/c-164217461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bill Bishop’s dog</a>, and found myself spending far more time in the app and sharing videos with friends. According to Sam Altman, I was not alone (“30-something percent of active users were active creators”). The profound implications of that sort of shift<em>—</em>from AI-enabled consumption to AI-enabled creation<em>—</em>anchor the second half of Ben’s analysis on Monday, including questions about the future of creative expression, and perhaps the future of Meta’s business.&nbsp;<em>—</em> <em>AS</em></li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dear members of the MIT community,</p><p>The U.S. Department of Education recently sent MIT and eight other institutions a proposed “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education," along with a letter asking that MIT review the document.</p><p>From the messages I've received, I know this is on the minds of many of you and that you care deeply about the Institute’s mission, its values and each other.
