  The HTTP <strong><code>418 I'm a teapot</code></strong> status response code indicates that the server refuses to brew coffee because it is, permanently, a teapot.
  A combined coffee/tea pot that is temporarily out of coffee should instead return <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/503"><code>503</code></a>.

                  <p>For anyone wanting interesting YT videos for their kids (and not wanting to take anything away from OP's project), I highly highly recommend thekidshouldseethis.com. It's basically a curated stream of cool videos, and I would feel totally safe letting my daughter browse it alone (she never does because we usually watch them together, but the curation is that good). Videos on all sorts of topics, and good enough to be really entertaining for both kids and adults - I can spend an evening there easily. They also have a really fantastic gift guide.</p>

                  <p>This is a great idea! Recommendation algos are weaponized against kids and would be great to have some way of managing it.
There is a similar problem with movies as well. It is hard to know whether a movie is appropriate for a child e.g. some kind of violence may be acceptable but not adult themes. So marking a movie PG-13 for example doesn't help much. There are some crowd-sourced solutions to this right now such as <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews" rel="nofollow">https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews</a> But LLMs could really help automate this</p>

And we're not talking promotion of a few posts, YC is now doing multiple batches a year and has hundreds of companies per batch meaning we're seeing a LOT of promotion / advertisements on this site coming via Launch HN threads as well as jobs ad threads.</p><p>I don't think Xerox park would have done as well if 5% of the people get got the opportunity for a microphone in the auditorium every week and the other 95% did not. That would seem like a caste system. I understand that YC funds this website so the caste system is inevitable but I don't see why moderation should further stratify it - unless you're prioritizing advertising YC companies over a great community.</p><p>Next, I see this "HN is not for self promotion" do a lot of downstream damage on the community in the sense that it's much better for big, existing trillion dollar companies than smaller players. If a small bootstrapped startup writes a blog post and mentions there product, people will complain about "blogspam" and "this blog post is really just an ad for a link at the end". But if Google or Amazon have a new announcement for a new product, nobody complains that it's an advertisement, even though it's often as much or more one. The end result is that the website tends to focus more "corporate" news than "hacker" news as a downstream consequence of a well-meaning "no self-promotion" rule.</p><p>Finally, as we've discussed over email, the rules around self-promotion are extremely opaque and in many cases algorithmically enforced by closed algorithms. This leads to a lot of confusion around what's allowed and a lot of ambiguous favoritism.</p><p>I understand this site is called "Hacker" news and there's some mystique around the "hacker" building "just for fun" , the purism around intellectual curiosity that you don't want tainted by dirty commercialism. I just think that once the website has decided it's going to be the media arm of one of the most powerful venture capital firms in the world, the ship has sailed.If people really want pure tech news, they should go to <a href="https://lobste.rs/" rel="nofollow">https://lobste.rs/</a> . I've personally found in recent years quality of interesting conversation is much higher on /r/saas, Indie Hackers board, and Small Bets campfire, as well as various Discords, all because they allow self-promotion and don't encourage the "self-promotion police" who frequently show up aghast someone would try to make money on the internet (unless it's their daddy FAANG employer).</p><p>Another rule I've seen in various places be very effective is a simple guideline to contribute 10x as much non-promotional content as promotional content. If someone only posts links to their projects and nothing else, I see how that gets spammy. But if someone regularly contributes they should get a pass. I understand that's partially how the submission system works via algorithmic enforcement, but , see above about its opaque and ambiguous nature.</p><p>Show HN is a "place" for self-promotion but it's a pretty bad place if 99% of submissions get entirely lost and ignored and I think you should encourage more places for promotion without inflicting a caste system where only YC companies and certain golden children get special rules.</p><p>Overall, HN's guidelines against self-promotion are too rigid, there's too few opportunties for small players to promote, which makes the discussion here less egalitarian, more corporate, and less interesting. You'd be better served encouraging more self-promotion in threads like these.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>Nice idea, but right now the villagers mostly say some variation on "I eagerly await the valiant hero's return!". Beside the fact that no villagers would ever speak so formally, this seems to fall into the standard fantasy problem that the normal people in the world only exist to further the hero's agency.

                  <p>Building Split Flap Displays. Started 18 months ago and kept me on a super interesting learning path. First shot was using open source designs (<a href="https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap">https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap</a>), but then kept building more and more parts myself. Coming from a software engineering background, getting into designing mechanical things â and then more importantly the electronics around it - has been really challenging, but also very rewarding. At this point I have my own screen printed flaps, custom PCB Design and a, what I consider, really smart protocol that allows me to daisy chain a basically arbitrary number of display elements. It's fun!</p>

I decided to go with running ML models on the client-side.</p><p>Technical implementation:
- Built and trained a compact TensorflowJS model (~3MB) that runs entirely in-browser
- Model lazy loads only when users are submitting reviews
- Classifies uploaded photos into Menu, Food &amp; Drink, or Vibes (interior/exterior)
- Zero server costs for inference, quick enough classification feedback</p><p>This approached solved several problems:
1. Reduced server costs by moving inference to the client
2. Improved UX with immediate photo categorization
3. Maintained app performance by lazy loading the model</p><p>Would love feedback from the HN community on:
- Optimizing the model size further
- Alternative approaches to client-side ML
- General UX improvements for local discovery apps</p><p>I had no prior ML experience, so this was a fun challenge :)</p></div></td></tr>

Our platform provides a single source of truth for your climate, sustainability, and emissions data. For example, if you are an American company trying to go-to-market in Europe, all it takes is purchasing an additional module and we will automatically generate the compliance documents and checklists for you based on the existing data we have on your company. We also offer managed âClimate Trust Centerâ dashboards that you can subdomain on your website for investors reporting and to satisfy disclosure requirements.</p><p>If you are in an EPA-regulated (or equivalents in Canada and Europe) industry (such as mining, oil and gas, minerals, rare earths, metal processing, airlines, construction, shipping/marine, logistics, heavy industries, agriculture/farming/food production, data center, power generation including renewables, adjacent ones like consumer goods, real estate, large scale AI training, climate derivatives etc.) or require sustainability consulting support in general, we would love to talk to you:

Raga is a term for a particular scale of notes (both ascending and descending).</p><p>Until now, this has mostly been in the domain of research and there is a ton of published literature out there. At the very basic level, if you have just voice, it is trivial to apply a pitch detection algorithm like YIN to get a pitch estimate and then analyse the sequence to figure out the raga. This doesn't work as well in a concert setup where speeds are higher due to gamakas, different instruments are used alongside and counterpoint melodies may make the music polyphonic. A lot of papers apply a variety of ML models (neural nets and otherwise) using several different features (cepstrum and mel-cepstrum, pitch distributions etc) with varying results.</p><p>So this is an interesting exercise in Signal Processing and Machine Learning. If anyone else is working on or has worked on this, I'd love to hear from you.</p><p>[1] -  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raga" rel="nofollow">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raga</a>)</p></div></td></tr>

I hope I'm wrong though, I still want this to succeed, for once in my life, I want to actually succeed on at least one thing. I want to contribute some good thing to the society.</p><p>First, what is it? It's a bookmarking app alternative to Pocket or Raindrop.io. Yeah, you can already tell it's not the most original idea. What makes it different, though, it's supposed to be self-hostable and additionally it's easy to deploy as it's only single binary file with no other runtime dependency--the database uses SQLite, which you can include it as a library in Rust.</p><p>What problems I'm facing while developing this? Honestly? I don't know, but I can't finish the last 10% progress of the app. It's funny--I first wrote it in Go, and it almost reached MVP. But, instead, I decided to just rewrite in Rust. Well, at least I got to learn new language while building this app, two birds one stone, or in Bahasa Indonesia, swimming while drinking water.</p><p>But now, I just can't force myself to continue. And I don't know why. Maybe perfectionism? It definitely doesn't have to do with skill though.</p><p>There are also another thing I'm working on: recovering from depression. One year ago, out of nowhere, I lost all my motivation doing anything--including university. I lost all my friends. Since then, I'm at the lowest point of my life. I visited psychiatrist multiple times. I don't know if it was effective, but recently I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>The Tagbox Project is also one of the efforts for me to recover from depression. The depression phase made me realize that I _want my works to have a positive effect on the world, even for just a little bit_. I don't want my skill to be used for evil companies that throws away moral and ethics. Specifically AI stuff, but that's OOT of this thread.</p><p>Here are the links if you're interested,</p><p><a href="https://gitlab.com/muhrizqiardi/tagbox_rs/" rel="nofollow">https://gitlab.com/muhrizqiardi/tagbox_rs/</a></p><p>This link is only the Rust rewrite version.

                  <p>Even without the other problems, I can assure you that the vast majority of managers will think that a 80% done project is almost done. The truth is the remaining 20% is where you have to fit everything together so you revisit an rewrite most of the project. It's a different kind of work that feels boring because you already did those things maybe 3,4 times already. It helps to understand the phase of the project you are in, to reduce the frustration. It also helps to do something even very small, every day and focus on that. One day you will run out of things to do.</p>

I would try to perhaps solve the mental health problem first perhaps before tackling big projects. Maybe try gym, hiking, somehow finding friends, talk to more people, solve your sleep, eat better - something.

Some tips:</p><p>- The "Load examples" menu in the top-left lets you compare the colors from Tailwind, IBM Carbon and United States Web Design System.</p><p>- The "contrast" menu lets you see how WCAG 2 contrast checks compare against APCA when "vs black/white" is turned on. WCAG 2 has known inaccuracies, especially for dark mode. APCA is the candidate contrast method for WCAG 3 that's meant to improve on this.</p><p>- Use the "..." menu to create a swatch based on a brand color.</p><p>- Use the "..." menu to "flip to dark/light palette" to create a dark theme.

A lot of stuff I've programmed and learned about over the last 3 years has been leading up to the goal of making something like this haha. I wanted to leverage OpenCL for compute but I had a lot of trouble getting OpenGL OpenCL interoperability to work.</p><p>A big motivation for such a project is my passion for photography. I've taken many thousands of photos over just the last 2 years alone. A lot of them are digital, and so far a few dozen rolls of film. A big challenge for me is that I'm not satisfied with the tools available to develop the raw files that are free or open source. Either they're quite finnicky, or they have noticeable issues with color transformations.</p><p>I've done a lot of rendering projects over the last few years relating to color that have been focused on getting a better understanding of working with color spaces. Lots of 2D and 3D fractals haha.</p><p>Unfortunately I've had quite a turbulent life the last few years so development is very off/on. Every autumn for me seems to be a period of change, this one no different as I'm moving and I'm a bit uncertain of things. However, a side project to all of this has been an OpenGL project where I'm working on things related to voxels! I did a lot of research on data structures like interval trees, octrees, segment trees, etc. It does seem that a lot of people jump for the octree approach, however I've been able to render a lot of voxels with just a hashmap of chunks and a 3d array haha (albeit, mostly initial implementation of chunk generation, single threaded at that!). With this I'm hoping to explore OpenGL compute as I intend of generating world geometry in compute shaders :D</p><p>I havent published a project in a while and I'm hoping to get back to putting things out there, so hopefully some of the stuff I've been working on goes well and I can put it up on GitHub or something</p></div></td></tr>

Years of Buddhist meditation only got me so far. But two months of this new technique, and I finally see a path to being able to program my emotional self like I program a computer. Here's how it works.</p><p>Step one. Identify the negative belief you want to change. This is the core belief. It is something you feel is true. For example, âI am a bad manager.â</p><p>Step two. Create a statement related to the belief that you believe is not true. This is the false statement. For example, âNo employees Ive managed have thought I did anything right as a manager.â</p><p>Step three. This is the training step. You spend a few minutes following your breathe to quiet your mind. Then you think the false statement and watch the emotional reaction the mind has to it. The reaction is an aversion, a kind of disgust. Then, say the false statement and the core belief together. âNo employees Iâve managed have thought I did anything right as a manager. Iâm a bad manager.â Repay the false statement and core belief together again and again, watching how the mind rejects the false statement and that aversion feeling lingers as the core belief is thought.</p><p>Step four. Repeat the training step in  daily sessions. During the session, repeated think the false belief and core belief. The session should last at least ten minutes. The daily sessions should be repeated for at least a week, and longer for more deeply held core beliefs. Over time, you come to reject the core belief just like you reject the false statement.</p><p>Here's why I think it works. There is a rational part of the mind in the prefrontal cortex. It is what we think with. But it is not where our beliefs are. We can rationalize our way to a new belief or to change a belief. Instead, beliefs are felt. And theyâre felt in the limbic emotional part of the brain. The limbic system is mute and cannot think with words. The prefrontal cortex canât directly talk to the limbic system with words. Instead, the prefrontal cortex must communicate with emotion. You have to train the limbic system to feel differently about a belief. You canât use positive affirmations because they are not felt as strongly as aversion.</p></div></td></tr>

I know on paper the circuit ratings are nearly 2x, but in practice it sounds like it's closer to 1.5x for the average kettle comparison.</p><p>80% efficiency for the heating coil, 1.6L of water, you need about ~750kJ (200Wh) get to a boil from 10C tap water.</p><p>So you'll need at least 70Wh output from your battery, and it needs to provide 1kW continuously.  Accounting for conversion losses and some buffer to avoid deep discharge I'll target 80Wh.  At 1kW that's a continuous 13C discharge rate, which is pretty high.  Hobby-oriented LiPo packs will do it, but I'm not sure how they would hold up for consumer product safety and longevity.  LiFePO cells could be a good choice since density is _less_ of a concern, and are readily available with 20+C continuous discharge.</p><p>I don't know my power electronics very well, so I'm not sure the best way to merge the outputs.  Any conversions are going to eat into total power and thus boil time, just rectifying the AC will take 20%.  Maybe it makes the most sense to have two separate coils, one direct from AC and a second from the battery?  With smaller cells in series, say 10+, to get a decent voltage it could end up with a manageable current to use directly with the 1kW boost.  In that case the only expensive power electronics needed would be to charge the batteries.</p><p>Also have to figure out how much recharge time matters to people, since by default it would be an hour or so.</p><p>It's going to have a chunky, heavy base, and guessing it will have to be pretty expensive for what it does, but I like it.</p></div></td></tr>

Who's going to pay hundreds of dollars for a battery-powered kettle just so they can save 1-2 minutes of time (and less if you're just making enough boiling water for 1 cup).  I use a little 100V (900W I think, according to the label) kettle to make tea, either 1 or 2 cups at a time, and while it's certainly not as speedy as those EU/UK market kettles, and a bit slower than a US kettle, it's fast enough.</p><p>A battery-powered one might save me 1 minute of time at best, but will cost probably at least 5-10x as much for the kettle, it'll be MUCH larger than my current kettle (that battery pack and power electronics needs space) which is a problem with my tiny kitchen, and I have to worry about how long the battery will last and how to dispose of it later and if I can even replace it.</p><p>This is really a solution in search of a problem.</p></div></td></tr>

Broadly speaking, it's an event based programming model, where "events" are things like "gaining a new belief", "dropping a belief", "selecting a plan to execute" (aka an "intention"), etc. AgentSpeak programs (normally) run "forever" cycling through a "reasoning cycle" that involves perceiving the world, updating beliefs, choosing intentions, executing intentions, communicating with other agents, etc.</p><p>And to commit a little self-plagiarism, from a recent post on LinkedIn:</p><p>----</p><p>On the one hand, AgentSpeak is basically a logic programming language with a lot of #prolog in its heritage. On the other hand, the runtime is all Java and to do anything interesting you have to write your custom Environment class and other helper functions in #Java. And while the interop is seamless in a way, getting your head around the execution model and knowing what's really happening at runtime can be a bit tricky.</p><p>Still, it's starting to make sense. And I do think this #BDI inspired approach has a lot going for it. I'm just looking forward to getting to the point where I can really start to exercise this. I have a few things that I want to accomplish soon:</p><p>1. I want to create a BDI agent that I can connect to an #XMPP server so I can talk with it from anywhere.</p><p>2. I want to start working on customized perception, using neural networks and various sensors (web-cam, microphone, accelerometer, distance sensor, etc.) to create an embodied agent that can truly sense its environment.</p><p>3. I want to take a stab at integrating some symbolic reasoning. I've given thought to trying to adapt the "belief base" to be an #RDF triplestore (probably #Apache #Jena) and include a reasoning engine or two. This all starts to get really speculative from here, but I spent a lot of time working on abductive inference a couple of years ago, and I'd like this thing to be able to use abductive inference, along with deductive reasoning, rule induction, possibly case based reasoning, etc. all in one system.</p><p>4. Might experiment with implementing a #Blackboard architecture and have specialized "problem solving" agents that collaborate by using the Blackboard in some situations. What would be really interesting here would be to figure out how to seamlessly translate in and out of a structured representation that lets you use existing specialized code for things like, eg. R for statistical operations.</p><p>5. And of course, experimenting with continual learning, as opposed to the "batch training job" stuff that we all use for ANN's today. This gets <i>really</i> speculative as well, but I want to explore contrastive learning, Hebbian learning, associative learning, operant conditioning (ala Pavlov), etc.</p><p>[5] above is why you'll see me spending as much time lately with Developmental Psychology, Infant Development, and Cognitive Psychology books, as with "AI" books per-se. I still believe that getting an AI that can learn from its environment, and build up useful mental representations with the minimal set of hard-coded behaviors, will be the best way to make progress with regards to #AGI.</p><p>----</p><p>I didn't mention it in the LinkedIn post, but as part of all  of this, I've been building a hardware platform for some time now as well, where said platform is meant to support "perceiving the environment" so the system can learn from the physical world. It's not finished yet, but today it includes a GPS receiver so it can "know" it's location in physical space, a 6-DOF accelerometer/magnetometer/gyroscope board so it can sense movement (of itself), and two microphones (for stereo audio input). Future plans include one or two webcams to emulate vision, and possibly some other sensors: IR and/or ultrasonic distance sensors, temperature sensor, humidity and barometric pressure sensors, etc.</p><p>Also in the "speculative / for the future" category: AgentSpeak programs don't have any inherent notion of learning built into the model. All "plans" (aka "desires" or "candidate intentions") have to be coded by the developer up-front. This is obviously pretty limiting if you're trying to create truly autonomous agents, so another area I want to dig into is how we might combine work on "AI Planning"[5] to dynamically create new plans.</p><p>And since this has kind of turned into a big brain-dump of stuff that's on my mind, I'll finish by saying that I've been chewing on some ideas about explicitly modeling other "mental states" that aren't part of the base BDI model. Things like "attitudes", "values", different emotional states (eg "boredom", "frustration", etc.), "curiosity", "confusion" / "cognitive dissonance", and so on.</p><p>[1]: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AgentSpeak" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AgentSpeak</a></p><p>[2]: <a href="https://jason-lang.github.io/" rel="nofollow">https://jason-lang.github.io/</a></p><p>[3]: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief%E2%80%93desire%E2%80%93intention_software_model" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief%E2%80%93desire%E2%80%93...</a></p><p>[4]: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief%E2%80%93desire%E2%80%93intention_model" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief%E2%80%93desire%E2%80%93...</a></p><p>[5]: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning_and_scheduling" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning_and_schedul...</a></p></div></td></tr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">NotebookLlama: An Open Source version of NotebookLM</h2><a id="user-content-notebookllama-an-open-source-version-of-notebooklm" aria-label="Permalink: NotebookLlama: An Open Source version of NotebookLM" href="#notebookllama-an-open-source-version-of-notebooklm"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes/blob/main/recipes/quickstart/NotebookLlama/resources/Outline.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes/raw/main/recipes/quickstart/NotebookLlama/resources/Outline.jpg" alt="NotebookLlama"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes/blob/main/recipes/quickstart/NotebookLlama/resources/_podcast.mp3">Listen to audio from the example here</a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is a guided series of tutorials/notebooks that can be taken as a reference or course to build a PDF to Podcast workflow.</p>
<p dir="auto">You will also learn from the experiments of using  Text to Speech Models.</p>
<p dir="auto">It assumes zero knowledge of LLMs, prompting and audio models, everything is covered in their respective notebooks.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Outline:</h3><a id="user-content-outline" aria-label="Permalink: Outline:" href="#outline"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Here is step by step thought (pun intended) for the task:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Step 1: Pre-process PDF: Use <code>Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct</code> to pre-process the PDF and save it in a <code>.txt</code> file.</li>
<li>Step 2: Transcript Writer: Use <code>Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct</code> model to write a podcast transcript from the text</li>
<li>Step 3: Dramatic Re-Writer: Use <code>Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct</code> model to make the transcript more dramatic</li>
<li>Step 4: Text-To-Speech Workflow: Use <code>parler-tts/parler-tts-mini-v1</code> and <code>bark/suno</code> to generate a conversational podcast</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Note 1: In Step 1, we prompt the 1B model to not modify the text or summarize it, strictly clean up extra characters or garbage characters that might get picked due to encoding from PDF. Please see the prompt in Notebook 1 for more details.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note 2: For Step 2, you can also use <code>Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct</code> model, we recommend experimenting and trying if you see any differences. The 70B model was used here because it gave slightly more creative podcast transcripts for the tested examples.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note 3: For Step 4, please try to extend the approach with other models. These models were chosen based on a sample prompt and worked best, newer models might sound better. Please see <a href="https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes/blob/main/recipes/quickstart/NotebookLlama/TTS_Notes.md">Notes</a> for some of the sample tests.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Detailed steps on running the notebook:</h3><a id="user-content-detailed-steps-on-running-the-notebook" aria-label="Permalink: Detailed steps on running the notebook:" href="#detailed-steps-on-running-the-notebook"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Requirements: GPU server or an API provider for using 70B, 8B and 1B Llama models.
For running the 70B model, you will need a GPU with aggregated memory around 140GB to infer in bfloat-16 precision.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note: For our GPU Poor friends, you can also use the 8B and lower models for the entire pipeline. There is no strong recommendation. The pipeline below is what worked best on first few tests. You should try and see what works best for you!</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Before getting started, please make sure to login using the <code>huggingface cli</code> and then launch your jupyter notebook server to make sure you are able to download the Llama models.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">You'll need your Hugging Face access token, which you can get at your Settings page <a href="https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Then run <code>huggingface-cli login</code> and copy and paste your Hugging Face access token to complete the login to make sure the scripts can download Hugging Face models if needed.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>First, please Install the requirements from <a href="https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes/blob/main/recipes/quickstart/NotebookLlama">here</a> by running inside the folder:</li>
</ul>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes
cd llama-recipes/recipes/quickstart/NotebookLlama/
pip install -r requirements.txt"><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes
cd llama-recipes/recipes/quickstart/NotebookLlama/
pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Notebook 1:</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This notebook is used for processing the PDF and processing it using the new Feather light model into a <code>.txt</code> file.</p>
<p dir="auto">Update the first cell with a PDF link that you would like to use. Please decide on a PDF to use for Notebook 1, it can be any link but please remember to update the first cell of the notebook with the right link.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please try changing the prompts for the <code>Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct</code> model and see if you can improve results.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Notebook 2:</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This notebook will take in the processed output from Notebook 1 and creatively convert it into a podcast transcript using the <code>Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct</code> model. If you are GPU rich, please feel free to test with the 405B model!</p>
<p dir="auto">Please try experimenting with the System prompts for the model and see if you can improve the results and try the 8B model as well here to see if there is a huge difference!</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Notebook 3:</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This notebook takes the transcript from earlier and prompts <code>Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct</code> to add more dramatization and interruptions in the conversations.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is also a key factor here: we return a tuple of conversation which makes our lives easier later. Yes, studying Data Structures 101 was actually useful for once!</p>
<p dir="auto">For our TTS logic, we use two different models that behave differently with certain prompts. So we prompt the model to add specifics for each speaker accordingly.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please again try changing the system prompt and see if you can improve the results. We encourage testing the feather light 3B and 1B models as well at this stage</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Notebook 4:</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Finally, we take the results from last notebook and convert them into a podcast. We use the <code>parler-tts/parler-tts-mini-v1</code> and <code>bark/suno</code> models for a conversation.</p>
<p dir="auto">The speakers and the prompt for parler model were decided based on experimentation and suggestions from the model authors. Please try experimenting, you can find more details in the resources section.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Note: Right now there is one issue: Parler needs transformers 4.43.3 or earlier and for steps 1 to 3 of the pipeline you need latest, so we just switch versions in the last notebook.</h4><a id="user-content-note-right-now-there-is-one-issue-parler-needs-transformers-4433-or-earlier-and-for-steps-1-to-3-of-the-pipeline-you-need-latest-so-we-just-switch-versions-in-the-last-notebook" aria-label="Permalink: Note: Right now there is one issue: Parler needs transformers 4.43.3 or earlier and for steps 1 to 3 of the pipeline you need latest, so we just switch versions in the last notebook." href="#note-right-now-there-is-one-issue-parler-needs-transformers-4433-or-earlier-and-for-steps-1-to-3-of-the-pipeline-you-need-latest-so-we-just-switch-versions-in-the-last-notebook"></a></p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Speech Model experimentation: The TTS model is the limitation of how natural this will sound. This probably be improved with a better pipeline and with the help of someone more knowledgable-PRs are welcome! :)</li>
<li>LLM vs LLM Debate: Another approach of writing the podcast would be having two agents debate the topic of interest and write the podcast outline. Right now we use a single LLM (70B) to write the podcast outline</li>
<li>Testing 405B for writing the transcripts</li>
<li>Better prompting</li>
<li>Support for ingesting a website, audio file, YouTube links and more. Again, we welcome community PRs!</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					
<p>In a quiet corner of the Pacific last August, a vessel unlike any other was making what many thought was its final voyage. <a href="https://gcaptain.com/internet-famous-flip-sent-for-scrap/">R/P FLIP </a>(Floating Instrument Platform), the U.S. Navyâs<a href="https://gcaptain.com/internet-famous-flip-sent-for-scrap/"> legendary research vessel </a>that could stand on end like a floating skyscraper, was being towed to Mexico to be scrapped. For well over half a century, FLIP had been an icon of oceanographic research, a testament to audacious engineering and the human thirst for discovery. Its <a href="https://gcaptain.com/internet-famous-flip-sent-for-scrap/">decommissioning</a>, announced last year, marked the end of an eraâor so it seemed.</p>



<p>But then, a twist befitting a maritime thriller unfolded. It looks like she has been saved! </p>



<h2 id="h-the-call-that-changed-everything">The Call That Changed Everything</h2>



<p>Giulio Maresca was sitting in his London office at <a href="https://www.deep.com/">DEEP</a>, the subsea design firm with ambitions to pioneer underwater human habitats, when the news crossed his desk: FLIP was <a href="https://gcaptain.com/internet-famous-flip-sent-for-scrap/">headed for dismantlement</a>. To Maresca and his colleagues, FLIP was more than metal and machinery; it was a symbol of what could be achieved when imagination met engineering.</p>



<p>âThe directive from our founder was quite clear,â Maresca recalls with a smile. ââSave her. Donât come back without her.'â</p>



<p>Within 48 hours, a DEEP team was en route to Mexico, racing against time to intercept the vessel before it met an ignoble end. It was a mission as quixotic as it was urgent.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-marvel-reborn">A Marvel Reborn</h2>

<p>FLIP isnât your typical ship. At 355 feet long, it was designed to do the unthinkable: flip from a horizontal floating position to a vertical one, submerging 300 feet of its length below the ocean surface. This unique capability allowed it to become an exceptionally stable platform, unaffected by surface wavesâa perfect sentinel for studying acoustics, wave dynamics, and marine life.</p>



<p>Commissioned in 1962, FLIP was a <a href="https://gcaptain.com/the-flip-scripps-institute-of-oceanography/">collaborative effort </a>between the U.S. Navyâs Office of Naval Research and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Over decades, it facilitated groundbreaking research that deepened our understanding of the oceanâs mysteries.</p>



<p>Shaped like a giant baseball bat, the 700-ton FLIP is technically not a ship but a barge. It has no propellers, propulsion, or engine room, and requires towing by a tugboat when conducting scientific missions.</p>



<p>âFLIP was from a time when bold engineering met boundless optimism,â <a href="https://www.deep.com/article/the-onrs-flipping-vessel-which-was-believed-to-be-scrapped-has-been-saved/">says</a> Kristen Tertoole, CEO of DEEP. âAn ethos we share and seek to embody.â</p>

<h2 id="h-the-journey-across-oceans">The Journey Across Oceans</h2>



<p>After tense negotiations and a flurry of logistical hurdles, DEEP secured ownership of FLIP. The vessel began a new journeyâfrom Mexico, through the Panama Canal, and across the Atlantic to the Mediterranean. It was a voyage that mirrored its original mission: bridging gaps and breaking boundaries.</p>



<p>Now docked in France, FLIP is slated for a 12 to 18-month refit at <a href="https://mb92.com/">MB92</a>, a shipyard rin Barcelona renowned for refurbishing superyachts and handling unusual projects.</p>



<p>âModernizing FLIP to further our understanding of the ocean is whatâs in our DNA,â says Rob Papworth, MB92 Group Managing Director. âWeâre exceptionally proud to be involved in this historic endeavor.â</p>



<h2 id="h-a-bold-vision-for-the-future">A Bold Vision for the Future</h2>



<p>DEEPâs ambitions for FLIP go beyond restoration. The company envisions the vessel as a cornerstone in their mission to âmake humans aquatic,â enabling people to live, work, and thrive underwater.</p>



<p>âFLIP will play a key role in our fleet, providing a one-of-a-kind platform for ocean research,â Tertoole explains. âSheâs not just a ship; sheâs a bridge to the next frontier.â</p>



<p>The refitted FLIP will support DEEPâs Sentinel habitat deployments, underwater living spaces designed for extended research missions. Interest from the global scientific community has been immediate and enthusiastic.</p>



<p>âIâm thrilled to confirm that many oceanographic and research groups are already in contact to ensure access,â Tertoole says.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-legacy-continued">A Legacy Continued</h2>



<p>News of FLIPâs salvation has reached those who knew her best.</p>



<p>âIâm delighted by DEEPâs decision to revitalize and modernize the R/P FLIP,â says Dr. Tom Drake of the Office of Naval Research. âThis modernization will significantly expand her capabilities in ocean science, breathing new life into a vessel that has been vital to our mission.â</p>



<p>For Maresca, the rescue of FLIP is both professional and deeply personal.</p>



<p>âEveryone in maritime research has a FLIP story,â he says. âSheâs inspired generations of scientists and engineers. To be part of her next chapter is beyond rewarding.â</p>



<h2 id="h-turning-tides">Turning Tides</h2>



<p>As FLIP prepares for her relaunch in early 2026, she carries with her not just instruments and equipment, but the weight of history and the promise of future discoveries.</p>



<p>âSheâs a vessel born from audacity,â Tertoole reflects. âAnd thatâs exactly what we need nowâto be bold in our pursuit of understanding our oceans.â</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><br>Up to $41 billion in World Bank climate finance ânearly 40 percent of all climate funds disbursed by the Bank over the past seven yearsâ is unaccounted for due to poor record-keeping practices, reveals a new Oxfam report published today ahead of the World Bank and IMF Annual Meetings in Washington D.C.</p><p>An Oxfam audit of the World Bankâs 2017-2023 climate finance portfolio found that between $24 billion and $41 billion in climate finance went unaccounted for between the time projects were approved and when they closed.</p><p>There is no clear public record showing where this money went or how it was used, which makes any assessment of its impacts impossible. It also remains unclear whether these funds were even spent on climate-related initiatives intended to help low- and middle-income countries protect people from the impacts of the climate crisis and invest in clean energy.</p><p>âThe Bank is quick to brag about its climate finance billions âbut these numbers are based on what it plans to spend, not on what it actually spends once a project gets rolling,â said Kate Donald, Head of Oxfam Internationalâs Washington D.C. Office. "This is like asking your doctor to assess your diet only by looking at your grocery list, without ever checking what actually ends up in your fridge.â</p><p>The Bank is the largest multilateral provider of climate finance, accounting for 52 percent of the total flow from all multilateral development banks combined.</p><p>The issue of climate finance will take center stage at this yearâs COP in Azerbaijan, where countries are set to negotiate a new global climate finance goal, the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG). Climate activists are demanding the Global North provide at least $5 trillion a year in public finance to the Global South "as a down payment towards their climate debt" to the countries, people and communities of the Global South who are the least responsible for climate breakdown but are the most affected. Oxfam warns that the lack of traceable spending could undermine trust in global climate finance efforts at this critical juncture.</p><p>âClimate finance is scarce, and yes, we know itâs hard to deliver. But not tracking how or where the money actually gets spent? Thatâs not just some bureaucratic oversight âitâs a fundamental breach of trust that risks derailing the progress we need to make at COP this year. The Bank needs to act like our future depends on tackling the climate crisis, because it does,â said Donald.</p><p>Oxfamâs investigation revealed that obtaining even basic information on how the World Bank is using climate finance was painstaking and difficult.</p><p>"We had to sift through layers of complex and incomplete reports, and even then, the data was full of gaps and inconsistencies. The fact that this information is so hard to access and understand is alarming âit shouldnât take a team of professional researchers to figure out how billions of dollars meant for climate action are being spent. This should be transparent and accessible to everyone, most importantly communities who are meant to benefit from climate finance," said Donald.<br>&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://clace.io/blog/sqlite/">https://clace.io/blog/sqlite/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41963996">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Clace is an
<a href="https://github.com/claceio/clace">open source project</a>
building a secure platform for easily developing and deploying internal
tools across a team. Clace can be used to develop actions which present a
simple auto-generated web UI for backend operations. Clace also implements
an appserver for containerized web apps implemented in any language.<br></p></div><h2>Background<span id="background"></span>
<a href="#background" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2><p>Clace is built to serve web applications, primarily for internal tools. Clace provides functionality usually handled separately by a web server and an application server. When the development of Clace was started last year, one of the first decisions was how to store the application data (files) and metadata. The app metadata obviously made sense to store in a database, since apps are created dynamically. The app data (static files, app code, config files etc) is usually stored on the file system by most web servers.</p><h2>Using SQLite for serving files<span id="using-sqlite-for-serving-files"></span>
<a href="#using-sqlite-for-serving-files" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2><p>For Clace, the decision was made to use <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SQLite</a> for app files storage instead of using the file system. The reasoning was mainly to be able to do atomic version changes. When updating an app, since there could be lots of files being updated, using a database would allow all changes to be done atomically in a transaction. This would prevent broken web pages from being served during a version change.</p><p>Clace uploads all files to the SQLite database during app creation and updates. Files are uploaded from GitHub or from local disk. Only for <a href="https://clace.io/docs/applications/lifecycle/#development-apps">development mode</a>, the local file system is used.</p><h2>Benefits of using SQLite<span id="benefits-of-using-sqlite"></span>
<a href="#benefits-of-using-sqlite" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2><p>The decision to use SQLite for file storage has provided lots of additional benefits (some unanticipated).</p><ul><li><p><strong>Transactional Updates</strong> : This is the main benefit. Updating multiple files can be done in one transaction. Isolation ensures that there are no broken webapps during the update.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deployment Rollbacks</strong>: Another of the transactional benefits is the ability to roll back deployment in case of errors. If multiple apps are being updated, all of them can be rolled back in one go. Rolling back a database transaction is much easier than cleaning up files on the file system.</p></li><li><p><strong>File De-duplication Across Versions</strong>: Clace automatically <a href="https://clace.io/docs/applications/overview/#app-listing">versions</a> all updates. This can lead to lots of duplicate files. The file data is stored in a table with the schema</p></li></ul><p>The uncompressed content SHA256 hash is used as the primary key to store the file data. This means that even if multiple versions of an app have the same file, the file contents are stored only once.</p><ul><li><p><strong>De-duplication Across Apps</strong> : Each production app in Clace has an <a href="https://clace.io/docs/applications/lifecycle/#application-types">staging app</a>. Apps can have multiple <a href="https://clace.io/docs/applications/lifecycle/#preview-apps">previews apps</a>. This can lead to lots of duplication of files. Using the database helps avoid all the duplication. Even across apps, there are files which have the same contents. Files are de-duplicated across apps also.</p></li><li><p><strong>Easy Backups</strong>: Using SQLite means that backups are easy. The state of the whole system, metadata and files can be backed up easily using SQLite backup tools like <a href="https://litestream.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Litestream</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Content Hashing</strong>: For content caching on the browser, web servers return a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETag</a> header. Using the database for files makes it easy to save the content SHA once during file upload without having to recompute it later.</p></li><li><p><strong>Compression</strong>: The file contents are saved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brotli</a> compressed in the SQLite table. The database approach has the advantage that contents can be saved in multiple formats easily. GZip compressed data and uncompressed data can be added by just adding a column in the <code>files</code> table.</p></li></ul><h2>Performance<span id="performance"></span>
<a href="#performance" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2><p>For Clace, the SQLite database approach provides great performance. There is no equivalent implementation using the file system to compare against, so a direct benchmark test is not done. Based on <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benchmarking</a> done by the SQLite team, SQLite can have better performance than direct file system use for some workloads.</p><h2>Multi-Node Support<span id="multi-node-support"></span>
<a href="#multi-node-support" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2><p>Clace currently runs on a single node. When multi-node support is added later, the plan is to use a shared Postgres database instead of using local SQLite for metadata and file data storage. This will come with latency issues. The plan is to use a local SQLite database as a file cache to avoid latency while accessing Postgres.</p><h2>Why this approach is not more common?<span id="why-this-approach-is-not-more-common"></span>
<a href="#why-this-approach-is-not-more-common" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2><p>One of the reasons most web servers use the file system is convenience. File updates can be done using any file system tool: rsync, tar etc work for copying files over. The other reason is probably historical: file systems are what were used before there were good in-process relational databases available. Using a database means some kind of API interface is required for uploading files, which is not always feasible.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>8.14</span></p><p>Pollen is a publishing system that helps authors make functional and beautiful digital books.</p><p>I created Pollen so I could make my web-based books <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/"><span>Practical Typography</span></a>, <a href="http://typographyforlawyers.com/"><span>Typography for Lawyers</span></a>, and <a href="http://beautifulracket.com/"><span>Beautiful Racket</span></a>. Sure, go take a look. Are they better than the last digital books you encountered? Yes they are. Would you like your next digital book to work like that? If so, keep reading.</p><p>At the core of Pollen is an argument:</p><ol><li><p>Digital books should be the best books weâve ever had. So far, theyâre not even close.</p></li><li><p>Because digital books are software, an author shouldnât think of a book as merely data. <span>The book is a program.</span></p></li><li><p>The way we make digital books better than their predecessors is by exploiting this programmability.</p></li></ol><p>Thatâs what Pollen is for.</p><p>Not that you need to be a programmer to start using Pollen. On the contrary, the Pollen language is markup-based, so you can write &amp; edit text naturally. But when you want to automate repetitive tasks, add cross-references, or pull in data from other sources, you can access a full programming language from within the text.</p><p>That language is <a href="http://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>. I chose Racket because it has some unique features that made Pollen possible. So if itâs unfamiliar to you, donât panic. It was unfamiliar to me. Once you see what you can do with Racket &amp; Pollen, you may be persuaded. I was.</p><p>Or, if you can find a better digital-publishing tool, use that. But Iâm never going back to the way I used to work.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/Installation.html"

Leonardo da Vinci was a studio apprentice to Verrocchio at 14 years old. Walt Disney took on a number of jobs, chiefly delivering papers, by 11. Vladimir Nabokov published his first poetry collection at 16, while still in school. Andrew Carnegie </span><em>finished</em><span> schooling at 12 and was 13 when he began his </span><em>second</em><span> job as a telegraph office boy, where he convinced his superiors to teach him the telegraph machine itself. By 16, he was the familyâs mainstay of income.</span></p><p>Readers (and some biographers) tend to fixate on the celebrity itself, the inflection point when people achieved fame. But their early lives often contain something more revealing than their successes. Before you grasp, you have to reach. How did they learn to reach?</p><p><span>In my examples, the individuals were all </span><em>doing</em><span> from a young age as opposed to merely attending school. And while they may not have wanted to work, the work was nonetheless something that they, their families, and society felt was useful</span><em>, </em><span>purposeful, and appreciated. In a sense, they had useful childhoods.</span></p><p>Do children today have useful childhoods?</p><p>~ ~ ~</p><p>An individualâs life can continue with an inertia that will lead them on to the next year or decade. Most young people today know approximately what they are going to be doing for the first twenty-or-more years of their life: school. Post-schooling, the inertia continues. Many a modern story opens with a workerâan office worker usuallyâwho is so inert that he scarcely notices the passage of time until he becomes blindsided by a sudden yank of reality that forces him out of this inertia. Since we do not live in stories, we have to ask: How can we make that pull ourselves?</p><p>Agency is the capacity to act. Gaining agency is gaining the capacity to do something different from the rigid path of events that simply happen to you. Remarkable people typically go off-script early, usually in more than one way. Carnegie becoming a telegraph message boy is one opportunity; asking how to operate the telegraph is another. He was handed the first one, but he had to ask for the second. Da Vinci had plenty of small-time commissions, but he quit them all in favor of offering his services to the Duke of Milan.</p><p>No one is asked to write a book, or start a company, or stage a play, or seek invention and excellence in the unknown. These acts are very contrary to the default script. Yet they are the resources that create the world. Imagine if Carnegie and Da Vinci were instead compelled to stay in school for 10 more years. What would have happened?</p><p>In these old biographies I find it interesting just how early and varied the avenues were that allowed promising adolescents to pivot off-script, and do something different than everyone else. For a 13-year-old today, what is the equivalent of being a telegraph office boy where one can learn technology while contributing? What about for a 16-year-old? What is todayâs equivalent of becoming Verrocchioâs studio apprentice at 14?</p><p>Where are the studios, anyway?</p><p>Modern complexity has erased some avenues for agency. After all, no boy can become a telegraph operator today. As complexity grows, sometimes stepping stone are removed. But the primary problem is not technology, it is how we have oriented the world and our expectations. A 13-year-old Steve Jobs once called Bill Hewlettâwhose number was simply listed in the phone bookâand received a summer job at Hewlett Packard. This would be unsurprising in Carnegieâs time, was certainly surprising for 1968, and is culturally verboten today.</p><p><span>We have a public imagination that cannot conceive of what exactly to do with children, especially smart children. We fail to properly respect them through adolescence, so we have engineered them to be in storage, and so they shuffle through a decade of busywork. Partly, the length of schooling has increased simply because it couldâbecause we no longer </span><em>need </em><span>children to work, yet need them to do something while the adults go do theirs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The sad result of schoolâs length and primacy is that it ensures there is nothing in particular for children to do. Since the rigid framework demands a certain number of hours-in-school-seat, it precludes other options. The time sink of school is a kind of </span><em>opportunity suffocation</em><span>, it makes it more difficult to imagine what good opportunities might even exist for most children. And the longer we disallow children from having the agency to act on the world, the harder it becomes for them to visualize it in the first place. The result is that we have young adults who have a difficult time adjusting once their life-script changes even a little bit, or once it simply ends past college. The path is rigid, yet brittle.</span></p><p>Modern schooling began as a track to be left as soon as you found something worthwhile to do with your life. But it has since morphed into an attempt at systematizing as many years of a childâs life as possible, extending well into their adulthood. At the same time, school can never gratify the smartest pupils as much as either party would like, because they are charged with the education of everyone. The result is that many precocious children will spend prime years of their life quite literally waiting for other students to finish.</p><p><span>Mass schooling attempts a systematization of skill and knowledge transfer. This is not </span><em>terrible</em><span> for the average person, but results are predictably averageâsystems at scale must function with and cater to the lowest common denominator, and the process of standardization loses all sensitivity to context. Since everyone must do the same things, it is difficult for any student to do exceptional things. The result is alarming on its own for wasting peopleâs youth. But even worse, in having so many years of life monopolized, people come to inadvertently believe that skill and knowledge transfer are primarily the domain of school rather than a normal consequence of meaningful work.</span></p><p>The ever-longer march through school creates a bizarre barrier separating the student from reality. As a consequence, childhood consists of the age when one can intuit well how the world works at the same time one is prevented from acting upon it meaningfully. Instead of creating adolescences full of rites of passage where one attempts to master something and accept responsibility, we have made it full of waiting and fake workâfor school is work. After a time, all children spot this fakeness, and all honest educators note it: teachers often say that one of the difficult parts of teaching is having to justify why the curriculum will be relevant and useful.</p><p>It is difficult to blame young adults for assuming that work is fake and meaningless if we prescribe fake and meaningless work for the first two decades of their existence. When meaningful work is an adult-only activity, it is little wonder that adolescence is a period of great depression. It would be surprising if it was not. Unlike the past, where many smart children finished sooner, modern education endlessly ushers them towards an often farther and more abstract futureâone so far away and abstract that some children become infected with the opposite of agency. They take on a learned helplessness and downplay that the future is a reality at all.</p><p>Higher education often fails to cure these deficiencies, and some people exit academia well into their twenties almost terrified to leave. How could we celebrate a form of learning that creates something so patheticâthe opposite of a readiness for life?</p><p>The institutions of higher and lower education have a purpose, but they are not your friend. They have no sensitivity to context. Their incentives are not the same as your incentives, and they have no interest in any individual going off-script. They ask nothing of you but your time and eventually your money, but these are not trivial things. And they will take as many of your prime years as you are willing to give them. School should be leveraged only so long as nothing else meaningful is available.</p><p><span>This is not the worship of employment, but an observation of fundamentals: it seems that the more you ask of people and the more you have them </span><em>do, </em><span>the more they grow into to the task of doing it on their own. While we shouldnât allow children to be factory bobbin boys, no one would describe Steve Jobâs summer job at 13 as his exploitation.</span></p><p><span>We should be thinking much harder about ensuring children can make meaningful contributions, and we should teach them in ways that are sensitive to the context of the real world. We are not looking for a job but opportunities for </span><em>mastery</em><span>: learning and practice beyond the depth one would find along the common path, which demands no such thing.</span></p><p>It might seem like the path forward is to fundamentally change the nature of schools, de-emphasize college, increase opportunities for apprenticeships, and so on. But waiting for any kind of policy daydream is a mistake. If a system lacks imagination, it is best to supply our own. History ebbs and flows with opportunity, and we find ourselves at a fortunate time.</p><p>When television first arrived, it was hailed by some as âa university in every home.â Such an optimistic prediction didnât quite come to pass, but the internet quietly enabled something betterâforms of education broader and deeper than the university.&nbsp;</p><p>User-generated content does not need the benefit of large audiences or the approval of large broadcasting companies. Students do not need permission to attend. In corners of the internet that are easy to miss, the biggest renaissance of informal skills transfer in history is happening right now. Unlike textbooks or professors, the creators of these educational materials are willing to engage with random students throughout the world, provide feedback, and even arrange meetupsâoften for free.</p><p>A close look at social media reveals ample opportunity for self-apprenticeship. We live in an era where a motivated 12-year-old can learn the basics of woodcraft, programming, or how to bake bread that would rival world-class bakeries. They can master nearly any mechanical system or any number of technical or artistic vocations, even if no mentor lives nearby. The limit is no longer some teacher or institution but a childâs own patience and interest, as well as the interested support of the parents.</p><p><span>Often the parents of precocious children do not appreciate this interest. They think a child engrossed in </span><em>Minecraft</em><span> is simply playing video games, instead of longing to build. It is the parentâs job to identify this motivation, and then leverage technology and their own resources to encourage something more meaningful. â</span><em>Heâs going to do great things one day.â</em><span> In his thirties? Why not today?</span></p><p>We can somewhat excuse schools for only covering topics broadly. But if education matters to a parent, then they should think hard about how they can allow their child a deep venture. Parents owe it to children to furnish them with materials, time, and useful pursuits. Schools will not supply them, and the most common failure mode with parenting is probably giving children options along the same feeble lines, and responsibilities too close to what they already have at school.&nbsp;</p><p>Occasionally parents might gesture towards an activity, like a lemonade stand on the sidewalk, to gratify a childâs interest. This is the archetypal poor choice: A lemonade stand does not teach the value of money but how to wait and occasionally beg. To understand business or food or hospitality, children would be better off trying to make something people really wanted.&nbsp;</p><p>For a simple example, a better home craft than lemonade might be a pastry, taken seriously. Not sugar cookies or muffins, but the kind of thing that is plain for a 13-year-old to understand, harder for him to make, and very difficult to master. If a child committed to a batch a day, documenting progress, perhaps in time he would have something worth selling.</p><p>And perhaps selling these at the side of the street wonât work, but it might work selling them somewhere repeatable and meaningful, like at local soccer practice, or even taking orders on the local Facebook group. Leveraging existing technology and a supportive parent, thereâs no reason a young teenager couldnât make thousands this way while attaining mastery of something.</p><p><span>The art of pastry comes to my mind as an example because Pierre HermÃ©, one of the most famous pastry chefs and chocolatiers in the world, began as an apprentice at 14. Such an apprenticeship is admirable, but it would be a shame for us to wait around for some mentor to appear. The ultimate mentor is always the parent, and the resources are broader than ever. What can your child make </span><em>today?</em><span> What can he do thatâs both rewarding and difficult? What can you do to facilitate such a thing? Or if youâre young enough yourselfâwhat can you repeat until you improve?</span></p><p>The goal of education is to create a path to mastery or responsibility. If a child can sell the fruit of his labor, so much the better. But the essential lesson is that every difficult thing attempted acts as a multiplier on his confidence and the rest of his knowledge. Drudgery is sometimes confused with building character, and I think this is a mistake. It is building skill itself that builds self-possession. After selling thousands of dollars worth of pastries over the summer, a child does not only know that he can make pastries. He knows that he can make anything.</p><p><span>I think it is worth some special reflection as to why programming is now the typical industry for precocious children. In many ways, it has a low bar to entry and is something that parents still allow their children to âwork atâ do despite the hour-demands of systematized schooling. It is one of the few industries with an immensely permissionless culture. You donât need an audience or patrons. You donât have to ask anyone. You donât have to get a building permit or any professional resources. You can just create. The advantages of this, especially for some children who are not allowed to do much else with their time, are immense. We should ask ourselves, slowly, carefully, and often: </span><em>what else can be like that?</em></p><p>It would be desirable if there were some common formulas for instilling mastery, a series of recipes and options for every child or young adult. But so long as society is committed to treating children unseriously, the obvious apprenticeships will be few. There may be more varied options than ever for any given child, but none of them will come to him on their own. They will lie just off the path, and the child or parent will need to go looking. One reason that schools will always do poorly at finding such opportunities for children is that the very best opportunities will always be a response to local needsâa sensitivity to context is precisely the thing that systems of scale fail at producing. But both parent and child should never confuse this with a lack of options. Our era is resource-rich, especially with educational resources, but onramp poor. The legwork is up to you.</p><p>Many fairy tales and stories are about finding oneâs place. The hero begins as a child full of wonder and ends up achieving mastery over the world. Visions of the future need to allow peopleânot just the cleverest among us, but all peopleâto imagine accepting a place in the world. If we fail to do this during the years of education, then we are not really educating. If we fail to allow children continuous contact with the world, we risk them coming to see their own lives as mere abstractions.</p><p>The purpose of education is to develop agency within a child. Purposeful work and achieving mastery are tools to getting there. They arenât the results of learning and imagination, itâs the other way aroundâlearning is simply the consequence of doing. To understand this is to understand the ecology that fosters genius and talent.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     <p>Iâve been having problems for the last 3 years or so where <a href="https://messwithdns.net/">Mess With DNS</a>
periodically runs out of memory and gets OOM killed.</p>
<p>This hasnât been a big priority for me: usually it just goes down for a few
minutes while it restarts, and it only happens once a day at most, so Iâve just
been ignoring. But last week it started actually causing a problem so I decided
to look into it.</p>
<p>This was kind of winding road where I learned a lot so hereâs a table of contents:</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="there-s-about-100mb-of-memory-available">thereâs about 100MB of memory available</h3>
<p>I run Mess With DNS on a VM without about 465MB of RAM, which according to
<code>ps aux</code> (the <code>RSS</code> column) is split up something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>100MB for PowerDNS</li>
<li>200MB for Mess With DNS</li>
<li>40MB for <a href="https://fly.io/blog/ssh-and-user-mode-ip-wireguard/">hallpass</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That leaves about 110MB of memory free.</p>
<p>A while back I set <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/gc-guide">GOMEMLIMIT</a> to 250MB
to try to make sure the garbage collector ran if Mess With DNS used more than
250MB of memory, and I think this helped but it didnât solve everything.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem-oom-killing-the-backup-script">the problem: OOM killing the backup script</h3>
<p>A few weeks ago I started backing up Mess With DNSâs database for the first time <a href="https://jvns.ca/til/restic-for-backing-up-sqlite-dbs/">using restic</a>.</p>
<p>This has been working okay, but since Mess With DNS operates without much extra
memory I think <code>restic</code> sometimes needed more memory than was available on the
system, and so the backup script sometimes got OOM killed.</p>
<p>This was a problem because</p>
<ol>
<li>backups might be corrupted sometimes</li>
<li>more importantly, restic takes out a lock when it runs, and so Iâd have to manually do an
unlock if I wanted the backups to continue working. Doing manual work like
this is the #1 thing I try to avoid with all my web services (who has time
for that!) so I really wanted to do something about it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thereâs probably more than one solution to this, but I decided to try to make
Mess With DNS use less memory so that there was more available memory on the
system, mostly because it seemed like a fun problem to try to solve.</p>
<h3 id="what-s-using-memory-ip-addresses">whatâs using memory: IP addresses</h3>
<p>Iâd run a memory profile of Mess With DNS a bunch of times in the past, so I
knew exactly what was using most of Mess With DNSâs memory: IP addresses.</p>
<p>When it starts, Mess With DNS loads this <a href="https://iptoasn.com/">database where you can look up the
ASN of every IP address</a> into memory, so that when it
receives a DNS query it can take the source IP address like <code>74.125.16.248</code> and
tell you that IP address belongs to <code>GOOGLE</code>.</p>
<p>This database by itself used about 117MB of memory, and a simple <code>du</code> told me
that was too much â the original text files were only 37MB!</p>
<pre><code>$ du -sh *.tsv
26M	ip2asn-v4.tsv
11M	ip2asn-v6.tsv
</code></pre>
<p>The way it worked originally is that I had an array of these:</p>
<pre><code>type IPRange struct {
	StartIP net.IP
	EndIP   net.IP
	Num     int
	Name    string
	Country string
}
</code></pre>
<p>and I searched through it with a binary search to figure out if any of the
ranges contained the IP I was looking for. Basically the simplest possible
thing and itâs super fast, my machine can do about 9 million lookups per
second.</p>
<h3 id="attempt-1-use-sqlite">attempt 1: use SQLite</h3>
<p>Iâve been using SQLite recently, so my first thought was â maybe I can store
all of this data on disk in an SQLite database, give the tables an index, and
thatâll use less memory.</p>
<p>So I:</p>
<ul>
<li>wrote a quick Python script using <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/">sqlite-utils</a> to import the TSV files into an SQLite database</li>
<li>adjusted my code to select from the database instead</li>
</ul>
<p>This did solve the initial memory goal (after a GC it now hardly used any
memory at all because the table was on disk!), though Iâm not sure how much GC
churn this solution would cause if we needed to do a lot of queries at once. I
did a quick memory profile and it seemed to allocate about 1KB of memory per
lookup.</p>
<p>Letâs talk about the issues I ran into with using SQLite though.</p>
<h3 id="problem-how-to-store-ipv6-addresses">problem: how to store IPv6 addresses</h3>
<p>SQLite doesnât have support for big integers and IPv6 addresses are 128 bits,
so I decided to store them as text. I think <code>BLOB</code> might have been better, I
originally thought <code>BLOB</code>s couldnât be compared but the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#sort_order">sqlite docs</a> say they can.</p>
<p>I ended up with this schema:</p>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE ipv4_ranges (
   start_ip INTEGER NOT NULL,
   end_ip INTEGER NOT NULL,
   asn INTEGER NOT NULL,
   country TEXT NOT NULL,
   name TEXT NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE ipv6_ranges (
   start_ip TEXT NOT NULL,
   end_ip TEXT NOT NULL,
   asn INTEGER,
   country TEXT,
   name TEXT
);
CREATE INDEX idx_ipv4_ranges_start_ip ON ipv4_ranges (start_ip);
CREATE INDEX idx_ipv6_ranges_start_ip ON ipv6_ranges (start_ip);
CREATE INDEX idx_ipv4_ranges_end_ip ON ipv4_ranges (end_ip);
CREATE INDEX idx_ipv6_ranges_end_ip ON ipv6_ranges (end_ip);
</code></pre>
<p>Also I learned that Python has an <code>ipaddress</code> module, so I could use
<code>ipaddress.ip_address(s).exploded</code> to make sure that the IPv6 addresses were
expanded so that a string comparison would compare them properly.</p>
<h3 id="problem-it-s-500x-slower">problem: itâs 500x slower</h3>
<p>I ran a quick microbenchmark, something like this. It printed out that it could
look up 17,000 IPv6 addresses per second, and similarly for IPv4 addresses.</p>
<p>This was pretty discouraging â being able to look up 17k addresses per section
is kind of fine (Mess With DNS does not get a lot of traffic), but I compared it to
the original binary search code and the original code could do 9 million per second.</p>
<pre><code>	ips := []net.IP{}
	count := 20000
	for i := 0; i &lt; count; i++ {
		// create a random IPv6 address
		bytes := randomBytes()
		ip := net.IP(bytes[:])
		ips = append(ips, ip)
	}
	now := time.Now()
	success := 0
	for _, ip := range ips {
		_, err := ranges.FindASN(ip)
		if err == nil {
			success++
		}
	}
	fmt.Println(success)
	elapsed := time.Since(now)
	fmt.Println("number per second", float64(count)/elapsed.Seconds())
</code></pre>
<h3 id="time-for-explain-query-plan">time for EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN</h3>
<p>Iâd never really done an EXPLAIN in sqlite, so I thought it would be a fun
opportunity to see what the query plan was doing.</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; explain query plan select * from ipv6_ranges where '2607:f8b0:4006:0824:0000:0000:0000:200e' BETWEEN start_ip and end_ip;
QUERY PLAN
`--SEARCH ipv6_ranges USING INDEX idx_ipv6_ranges_end_ip (end_ip&gt;?)
</code></pre>
<p>It looks like itâs just using the <code>end_ip</code> index and not the <code>start_ip</code> index,
so maybe it makes sense that itâs slower than the binary search.</p>
<p>I tried to figure out if there was a way to make SQLite use both indexes, but I
couldnât find one and maybe it knows best anyway.</p>
<p>At this point I gave up on the SQLite solution, I didnât love that it was
slower and also itâs a lot more complex than just doing a binary search. I felt
like Iâd rather keep something much more similar to the binary search.</p>
<h3 id="attempt-2-use-a-trie">attempt 2: use a trie</h3>
<p>My next idea was to use a
<a href="https://medium.com/basecs/trying-to-understand-tries-3ec6bede0014">trie</a>,
because I had some vague idea that maybe a trie would use less memory, and
I found this library called
<a href="https://github.com/seancfoley/ipaddress-go">ipaddress-go</a> that lets you look up IP addresses using a trie.</p>
<p>I tried using it <a href="https://gist.github.com/jvns/3ce617796b22127017590ac62c57fddd">hereâs the code</a>, but I
think I was doing something wildly wrong because, compared to my naive array + binary search:</p>
<ul>
<li>it used WAY more memory (800MB to store just the IPv4 addresses)</li>
<li>it was a lot slower to do the lookups (it could do only 100K/second instead of 9 million/second)</li>
</ul>
<p>Iâm not really sure what went wrong here but I gave up on this approach and
decided to just try to make my array use less memory and stick to a simple
binary search.</p>
<h3 id="some-notes-on-memory-profiling">some notes on memory profiling</h3>
<p>One thing I learned about memory profiling is that you can use <code>runtime</code>
package to see how much memory is currently allocated in the program. Thatâs
how I got all the memory numbers in this post. Hereâs the code:</p>
<pre><code>func memusage() {
	runtime.GC()
	var m runtime.MemStats
	runtime.ReadMemStats(&amp;m)
	fmt.Printf("Alloc = %v MiB\n", m.Alloc/1024/1024)
	// write mem.prof
	f, err := os.Create("mem.prof")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	pprof.WriteHeapProfile(f)
	f.Close()
}
</code></pre>
<p>Also I learned that if you use <code>pprof</code> to analyze a heap profile there are two
ways to analyze it: you can pass either <code>--alloc-space</code> or <code>--inuse-space</code> to
<code>go tool pprof</code>. I donât know how I didnât realize this before but
<code>alloc-space</code> will tell you about everything that was allocated, and
<code>inuse-space</code> will just include memory thatâs currently in use.</p>
<p>Anyway I ran <code>go tool pprof -pdf --inuse_space mem.prof &gt; mem.pdf</code> a lot. Also
every time I use pprof I find myself referring to <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/09/24/profiling-go-with-pprof/">my own intro to pprof</a>, itâs probably
the blog post I wrote that I use the most often. I should add <code>--alloc-space</code>
and <code>--inuse-space</code> to it.</p>
<h3 id="attempt-3-make-my-array-use-less-memory">attempt 3: make my array use less memory</h3>
<p>I was storing my ip2asn entries like this:</p>
<pre><code>type IPRange struct {
	StartIP net.IP
	EndIP   net.IP
	Num     int
	Name    string
	Country string
}
</code></pre>
<p>I had 3 ideas for ways to improve this:</p>
<ol>
<li>There was a lot of repetition of <code>Name</code> and the <code>Country</code>, because a lot of IP ranges belong to the same ASN</li>
<li><code>net.IP</code> is an <code>[]byte</code> under the hood, which felt like it involved an unnecessary pointer, was there a way to inline it into the struct?</li>
<li>Maybe I didnât need both the start IP and the end IP, often the ranges were consecutive so maybe I could rearrange things so that I only had the start IP</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="idea-3-1-deduplicate-the-name-and-country">idea 3.1: deduplicate the Name and Country</h3>
<p>I figured I could store the ASN info in an array, and then just store the index
into the array in my <code>IPRange</code> struct. Here are the structs so you can see what
I mean:</p>
<pre><code>type IPRange struct {
	StartIP netip.Addr
	EndIP   netip.Addr
	ASN     uint32
	Idx     uint32
}

type ASNInfo struct {
	Country string
	Name    string
}

type ASNPool struct {
	asns   []ASNInfo
	lookup map[ASNInfo]uint32
}
</code></pre>
<p>This worked! It brought memory usage from 117MB to 65MB â a 50MB savings. I felt good about this.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jvns/mess-with-dns/blob/94f77b4bb1597b5e2a6768e33bd6c285919aa1bf/api/streamer/ip2asn/ip2asn.go#L18-L54">Hereâs all of the code for that part</a>.</p>
<h3 id="how-big-are-asns">how big are ASNs?</h3>
<p>As an aside â Iâm storing the ASN in a <code>uint32</code>, is that right? I looked in the ip2asn
file and the biggest one seems to be 401307, though there are a few lines that
say <code>4294901931</code> which is much bigger and would not fit in a uint32. I decided
to just ignore the gigantic ASNs and assume I could fit everything in a uint32.</p>
<p>Hereâs one of the lines with a gigantic ASN from the file:</p>
<pre><code>59.101.179.0	59.101.179.255	4294901931	Unknown	AS4294901931
</code></pre>
<h3 id="idea-3-2-use-netip-addr-instead-of-net-ip">idea 3.2: use <code>netip.Addr</code> instead of <code>net.IP</code></h3>
<p>It turns out that Iâm not the only one who felt that <code>net.IP</code> was using an
unnecessary amount of memory â in 2021 the folks at Tailscale released a new
IP address library for Go which solves this and many other issues. <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/netaddr-new-ip-type-for-go">They wrote a great blog post about it</a>.</p>
<p>I discovered (to my delight) that not only does this new IP address library exist and do exactly what I want, itâs also now in the Go
standard library as <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/net/netip#Addr">netip.Addr</a>. Switching to <code>netip.Addr</code> was
very easy and saved another 20MB of memory, bringing us to 46MB.</p>
<p>I didnât try my third idea (remove the end IP from the struct) because Iâd
already been programming for long enough on a Saturday morning and I was happy
with my progress.</p>
<p>Itâs always such a great feeling when I think âhey, I donât like this, there
must be a better wayâ and then immediately discover that someone has already
made the exact thing I want, thought about it a lot more than me, and
implemented it much better than I would have.</p>
<h3 id="all-of-this-was-messier-in-real-life">all of this was messier in real life</h3>
<p>Even though I tried to explain this in a simple linear way âI tried X, then I
tried Y, then I tried Zâ, thatâs kind of a lie â I always try to take my
actual debugging process (total chaos) and make it seem more linear and
understandable because the reality is just too annoying to write down. Itâs
more like:</p>
<ul>
<li>try sqlite</li>
<li>try a trie</li>
<li>second guess everything that I concluded about sqlite, go back and look at
the results again</li>
<li>wait what about indexes</li>
<li>very very belatedly realize that I can use <code>runtime</code> to check how much
memory everything is using, start doing that</li>
<li>look at the trie again, maybe I misunderstood everything</li>
<li>give up and go back to binary search</li>
<li>look at all of the numbers for tries/sqlite again to make sure I didnât misunderstand</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-result-saved-70mb-of-memory">the result: saved 70MB of memory!</h3>
<p>I deployed the new version and now Mess With DNS is using less memory! Hooray!</p>
<p>A few other notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>lookups are a little slower â in my microbenchmark they went from 9 million
lookups/second to 6 million, maybe because I added a little indirection.
Using less memory and a little more CPU seemed like a good tradeoff though.</li>
<li>itâs still using more memory than the raw text files do (46MB vs 37MB), I
guess pointers take up space and thatâs okay.</li>
</ul>
<p>Iâm honestly not sure if this will solve all my memory problems, probably not!
But I had fun, I learned a few things about SQLite, I still donât know what to
think about tries, and it made me love binary search even more than I already
did.</p>

   <p>In the 1960s, the sugar industry funded research that downplayed the risks of sugar and highlighted the hazards of fat, according to <a href="http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2548255">a newly published article</a> in <em>JAMA Internal Medicine. </em></p>   <p>The article draws on internal documents to show that an industry group called the Sugar Research Foundation wanted to "refute" concerns about sugar's possible role in heart disease. The SRF then sponsored research by Harvard scientists that did just that. The result was published in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> in 1967,<em> </em>with no disclosure of the sugar industry funding.</p>

   <p>The sugar-funded project in question was a literature review, examining a variety of studies and experiments. It suggested there were major problems with all the studies that implicated sugar, and concluded that cutting fat out of American diets was the best way to address coronary heart disease.</p>   <p>The authors of the new article say that for the past five decades, the sugar industry has been attempting to influence the scientific debate over the relative risks of sugar and fat.</p>   <p>"It was a very smart thing the sugar industry did, because review papers, especially if you get them published in a very prominent journal, tend to shape the overall scientific discussion," co-author Stanton Glantz <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/well/eat/how-the-sugar-industry-shifted-blame-to-fat.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;module=Trending&amp;version=Full&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article">told The New York Times</a>.</p>   <p><strong>Money on the line</strong></p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES493747959" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>In the article, published Monday, authors Glantz, Cristin Kearns and Laura Schmidt aren't trying make the case for a link between sugar and coronary heart disease. Their interest is in the process. They say the documents reveal the sugar industry attempting to influence scientific inquiry and debate.</p>   <p>The researchers note that they worked under some limitations â "We could not interview key actors involved in this historical episode because they have died," they write. Other organizations were also advocating concerns about fat, they note.</p>   
   <p>There's no evidence that the SRF directly edited the manuscript published by the Harvard scientists in 1967, but there is "circumstantial" evidence that the interests of the sugar lobby shaped the conclusions of the review, the researchers say.</p>   <p>For one thing, there's motivation and intent. In 1954, the researchers note, the president of the SRF gave a speech describing a great business opportunity.</p>   <p>If Americans could be persuaded to eat a lower-fat diet â for the sake of their health â they would need to replace that fat with something else. America's per capita sugar consumption could go up by a third<em>. </em></p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES493747943" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>But in the '60s, the SRF became aware of "flowing reports that sugar is a less desirable dietary source of calories than other carbohydrates," as John Hickson, SRF vice president and director of research, put it in one document.</p>   <p>He recommended that the industry fund its own studies â "Then we can publish the data and refute our detractors."</p>   <p>The next year, after several scientific articles were published suggesting a link between sucrose and coronary heart disease, the SRF approved the literature-review project. It wound up paying approximately $50,000 in today's dollars for the research.</p>   <p>One of the researchers was the chairman of Harvard's Public Health Nutrition Department â and an ad hoc member of SRF's board.</p>   <p><strong>"A different standard" for different studies</strong></p>   <p>Glantz, Kearns and Schmidt say many of the articles examined in the review were hand-selected by SRF, and it was implied that the sugar industry would expect them to be critiqued.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES493747963" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>In a letter, SRF's Hickson said that the organization's "particular interest" was in evaluating studies focused on "carbohydrates in the form of sucrose."</p>   <p>"We are well aware," one of the scientists replied, "and will cover this as well as we can."</p>   <p>The project wound up taking longer than expected, because more and more studies were being released that suggested sugar might be linked to coronary heart disease. But it was finally published in 1967.</p>   <p>Hickson was certainly happy with the result: "Let me assure you this is quite what we had in mind and we look forward to its appearance in print," he told one of the scientists.</p>   
   <p>The review <a href="http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/INTEMED/0/ISC160005supp1_prod.pdf">minimized the significance</a> of research that suggested sugar could play a role in coronary heart disease. In some cases the scientists alleged investigator incompetence or flawed methodology.</p>   <p>"It is always appropriate to question the validity of individual studies," Kearns <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-12/how-big-sugar-enlisted-harvard-scientists-to-influence-how-we-eat-in-1965">told Bloomberg</a> via email. But, she says, "the authors applied a different standard" to different studies â looking very critically at research that implicated sugar, and ignoring problems with studies that found dangers in fat.</p>   <p>Epidemiological studies of sugar consumption â which look at patterns of health and disease in the real world â were dismissed for having too many possible factors getting in the way. Experimental studies were dismissed for being too dissimilar to real life.</p>   <p>One study that found a health benefit when people ate less sugar and more vegetables was dismissed because that dietary change was not feasible.</p>   <p>Another study, in which rats were given a diet low in fat and high in sugar, was rejected because "such diets are rarely consumed by man."</p>   <p>The Harvard researchers then turned to studies that examined risks of fat â which included the same kind of epidemiological studies they had dismissed when it came to sugar.</p>   <p>Citing "few study characteristics and no quantitative results," as Kearns, Glantz and Schmidt put it, they concluded that cutting out fat was "no doubt" the best dietary intervention to prevent coronary heart disease.</p>   <p><strong>Sugar lobby: "Transparency standards were not the norm"</strong></p>   <p>In a statement, the Sugar Association â which evolved out of the SRF â said it is challenging to comment on events from so long ago.</p>   <p>"We acknowledge that the Sugar Research Foundation should have exercised greater transparency in all of its research activities, however, when the studies in question were published funding disclosures and transparency standards were not the norm they are today," the association said.</p>   <p>"Generally speaking, it is not only unfortunate but a disservice that industry-funded research is branded as tainted," the statement continues. "What is often missing from the dialogue is that industry-funded research has been informative in addressing key issues."</p>   
   <p>The documents in question are five decades old, but the larger issue is of the moment, as Marion Nestle <a href="http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2548251">notes in a commentary</a> in the same issue of <em>JAMA Internal Medicine:</em></p>   <blockquote><p>"Is it really true that food companies deliberately set out to manipulate research in their favor? Yes, it is, and the practice continues. In 2015, the <em>New York Times </em>obtained emails revealing <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/coca-cola-funds-scientists-who-shift-blame-for-obesity-away-from-bad-diets/?_r=1">Coca-Cola's cozy relationships with sponsored researchers</a> who were conducting studies aimed at minimizing the effects of sugary drinks on obesity. Even more recently, the Associated Press obtained emails showing how <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/f9483d554430445fa6566bb0aaa293d1">a candy trade association funded and influenced studies</a> to show that children who eat sweets have healthier body weights than those who do not."</p></blockquote>   <p>As for the article authors who dug into the documents around this funding, they offer two suggestions for the future.</p>   <p>"Policymaking committees should consider giving less weight to food industry-funded studies," they write.</p>   <p>They also call for new research into any ties between added sugars and coronary heart disease.</p>
