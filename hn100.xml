<blockquote>
<p>supports DRM functions and may not be fully accessible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's an extension of the ATA protocol (the "language" spoken between your mainboard and your SATA SSDs), which allows for the storage device to reply differently, depending on whether a request was signed by the trusted platform module on the mainboard. That way, things like video player devices that only give access to the stored data when the software has proven itself to be unmodified can be implemented. (I can find much more interesting use cases, but digital rights management seems to be what the kernel authors saw as the application for this when they implemented that warning.) That also means that Linux might simply get an "incomplete" view of the SSD, hence it warns you about that, in case you wonder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>read cache: enabled, doesn't support DPO or FUA</p>
</blockquote>
<p>uff, this just tells you that the device has a read cache: the computer fetches some smaller unit of data, and the device keeps that (and potentially more of its surroundings) around in a smaller, faster "transparent" piece of memory. That makes sense, because it's more common that data that was recently read is read again than some data that nobody cared about for a long time.</p>
<p>DPO and FUA are just really old techniques to tell SCSI (and consequently, ATAPI) devices to bypass that cache (FUA was supposed to force reading from the spinning platter without using what's in the cache, whereas DPO was meant to say, hey, this is probably a one-off read; don't care to start caching what I read here). Makes no sense for an SSD in how they were thought out in the early 1990s, so these extensions are not available for your SSD.</p>

				<p><em>How surveillance capitalism and DRM turned home tech from friend to foe.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/choke_hero_4.jpg"><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/choke_hero_4-450x253.jpg" alt="An illustration of Darth Vader choking someone on a retro TV set." width="450" height="253"></a></p>
<p>For a while—in the ’80s, ’90s, and early 2000s—it <a href="https://www2.itif.org/2017-why-so-sad.pdf">felt like</a> nerds were making the world a better place. Now, it feels like the most successful tech companies are making it worse.</p>
<p>Internet surveillance, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/09/1121295499/facebook-twitter-youtube-instagram-tiktok-social-media">algorithmic polarization</a> of social media, <a href="http://<a href=" https:="" techcrunch.com="" 2018="" 10="" 15="" sneaky-subscriptions-are-plaguing-the-app-store="" "="">predatory app stores</a>, and extractive business models have eroded the freedoms the personal computer once promised, effectively ending the PC era for most tech consumers.</p>
<p>The “personal computer” was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib/Dream_Machines">once a radical idea</a>—a computer an individual could own and control completely. The concept emerged in the early 1970s when microprocessors made it economical and practical for a person to own their very own computer, in contrast to the rise of data processing mainframes in the 1950s and 60s.</p>
<p>At its core, the PC movement was about a kind of tech liberty—–which I’ll define as the freedom to explore new ideas, control your own creative works, and make mistakes without punishment.</p>
<p>The personal computer era bloomed in the late 1970s and continued into the 1980s and 90s. But over the past decade in particular, the Internet and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">digital rights management</a> (DRM) have been steadily pulling that control away from us and putting it into the hands of huge corporations. We need to take back control of our digital lives and make computing personal again.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong: I’m not calling the tech industry evil. I’m a huge fan of technology. The industry is full of great people, and this is not a personal attack on anyone. I just think runaway market forces and a handful of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/the-copyright-rule-we-need-to-repeal-if-we-want-to-preserve-our-cultural-heritage/274049/">poorly-crafted US laws</a> like section 1201 of the DMCA have put all of us onto the wrong track (more on that below).</p>
<p>To some extent, tech companies were always predatory. To some extent, all companies are predatory. It’s a matter of degrees. But I believe there’s a fundamental truth that we’ve charted a deeply unhealthy path ahead with consumer technology at the moment.</p>
<p>Tech critic Ed Zitron calls this phenomenon “<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-rot-economy/">The Rot Economy</a>,” where companies are more obsessed with continuous growth than with providing useful products. “Our economy isn’t one that produces things to be used, but things that increase usage,” Zitron <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-anti-economy/">wrote</a> in another piece, bringing focus to ideas I’ve been mulling for the past half-decade.</p>
<p>This post started as a 2022 <a href="https://x.com/benjedwards/status/1541029918783311873">Twitter thread</a>, and I’ve offered to write editorials about my frustrations with increasingly predatory tech business practices since 2020 for my last two employers, but both declined to publish them. I understand why. These are uncomfortable truths to face. But if you love technology like I do, we have to accept what we’re doing wrong if we are going to make it better.</p>

<h3>Learning From the Past</h3>
<p>While consumer and computer tech today is more powerful than ever before—and in some ways far more convenient—some of the structural ways we used to interface with technology companies were arguably healthier in the past.</p>
<p>For example, which part of the Apple II was predatory? It promised productivity, education, and entertainment. You could program it yourself, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/809799/45-years-later-the-apple-ii-still-has-lessons-to-teach-us/">repair or expand it</a> without restriction. No subscriptions, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/08/a-new-jailbreak-for-john-deere-tractors-rides-the-right-to-repair-wave/">no hardware DRM</a> (though there was software <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/174/old-school-copy-protection-schemes">copy protection</a>), no tracking. No need for <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/03/08/apple-given-an-f-by-us-pirg-for-difficult-iphone-repairs">special tools</a> to repair it either. In fact, Apple <a href="https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/ftp.apple.asimov.net/documentation/hardware/io/Apple%20II%20Hobby%20and%20Prototyping%20Board%20Manual.pdf">openly encouraged</a> experimentation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/apple_II.jpg"><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/apple_II-450x345.jpg" alt="A man in a kitchen using an Apple II from a 1977 advertisement." width="450" height="345"></a></p>
<p>Further, what percentage of your income had to go towards annual <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/apple-one-billion-paid-subscriptions-services-earnings-june-2023-1235686807/">software subscriptions</a> on a 20th century Windows PC (like this Sony VAIO)? You bought an application and you owned an indefinite license to use it. If there was an upgrade, you bought that too. And if you liked an older version of the software, you could keep using it without having it vanish in an automatic update.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sony_vaio2.jpg"><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sony_vaio2-450x339.jpg" alt="A Sony VAIO computer." width="450" height="339"></a></p>
<p>How many Nintendo Entertainment System games sustained themselves with <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/13/kid-spends-16k-on-in-app-purchases-for-ipad-game-sonic-forces">in-app purchases</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/znpaau/i_worked_in_the_mobile_industry_for_10_years_loot/">microtransactions</a>?

<h2>The Extractive Model</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-pit_mining#/media/File:Twincreeksblast.jpg"><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/strip_mining.jpg" alt="Strip Mining Wikipedia photo by Geomartin" width="420"></a></p>
<p>Americans have allowed runaway business models, empowered by tech, to subvert privacy and individual liberty on the road to making money. Our default tech business model has become extractive, like part of a strip-mining operation. Consumers—and now <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/have-ai-image-generators-assimilated-your-art-new-tool-lets-you-check/">creative works</a> (used for training AI)—are treated as a natural resource to be milked and exploited.</p>
<p>The extractive model may end up being self-destructive for the tech industry itself. In the physical world, resource extraction needs limits and regulations to be sustainable. It can be wildly profitable until a resource becomes over-harvested, or the harvesting process corrupts the environment that lets the industry exist in the first place.</p>
<p>There’s also the drive to lock consumers into an ecosystem, powered by DRM. You should buy tech products and get direct value fairly, not unleash a secret vampire to track you, manipulate you, and attempt to extract money from you forever. Just because companies have unlocked this “everything as a service” endless money hack does not mean they should do it.</p>
<p>And there’s another problem. Very soon, we might be <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90549441/how-to-prevent-deepfakes">threatening the continuity of history itself</a> with technologies that pollute the historical record with AI-generated noise. It sounds dramatic, but that could eventually undermine the shared cultural bonds that hold cultural groups together.</p>
<p>That’s important because history is what makes this type of criticism possible. History is how we know if we’re being abused because we can rely on written records of people who came before (even 15 minutes ago) and make comparisons. If technology takes history away from us, there may be no hope of recovery.</p>
<h2>How We Can Reclaim Control</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/images/pcworld/ibm_pc_30_small.jpg" alt="Benj's IBM PC 5150"></p>
<p>Every generation <a href="https://twitter.com/paulisci/status/1669113362058444800?s=20">looks back</a> and says, “Things used to be better,” whether they are accurate or not.</p>
<p>But I’m not suggesting we live in the past. It is possible to learn from history and integrate the best of today’s technology with fair business practices that are more sustainable and healthy for everyone in the long run.</p>
<p>In the short term, we can do things like support open projects like Linux, support non-predatory and open source software, and run apps and store data locally as much as possible. But some bigger structural changes are necessary if we really want to launch the era of Personal Computer 2.0.</p>
<p>I’ve shown this editorial to friends, and some people felt that I did not emphasize the benefits of current technology enough. But I argue that my criticism is less about the actual technology and more about how we use it—and how companies make money from it.</p>
<p>Since I originally wrote my thoughts in a <a href="https://x.com/benjedwards/status/1541029918783311873?s=20">viral Twitter thread</a> in June 2022, others have expanded on these ideas with far more eloquence. Five months after my thread, Cory Doctorow wrote <a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/social-quitting-1ce85b67b456">his first</a> post on “enshittification,” a hallmark piece identifying a tendency for online platforms to decay over time.</p>
<p>A common thread between many of the issues hinted at above and in both Doctorow and Zitron’s work has been the rise of the ubiquitous Internet, which has allowed content owners and device makers to keep an eye on (and influence) consumer habits remotely, pulling our strings like puppeteers and putting a drip feed on our wallets.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-circumvention">section 1201</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act">DMCA</a> made it illegal to circumvent DRM, allowing manufacturers to lock down platforms in a way that challenges the traditional concept of ownership, enables predatory app stores, and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/the-copyright-rule-we-need-to-repeal-if-we-want-to-preserve-our-cultural-heritage/274049/">threatens our cultural history</a>.</p>
<p>We need <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/us-data-privacy-laws-enter-new-era-2023-2023-01-12/">comprehensive privacy legislation</a> in the United States that enshrines individual privacy as a fundamental right. We need <a href="https://www.repair.org/stand-up">Right to Repair legislation</a> that puts control of our devices back into our hands—and also DRM reform, especially <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/the-copyright-rule-we-need-to-repeal-if-we-want-to-preserve-our-cultural-heritage/274049/">repealing Section 1201 of the DMCA</a> so we can control the goods we own and historians can preserve our cultural heritage without <a href="https://www.technologizer.com/2012/01/23/why-history-needs-software-piracy/">the need for piracy</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/13/03/the-copyright-rule-we-need-to-repeal-if-we-want-to-preserve-our-cultural-heritage/274049/" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/mickeymouse_small.jpg" alt="Mickey Mouse Copyright Blur"></a></p>
<p>Tech monopolies must be held to account, the outsized influence of some tech billionaires must be held in check, and competition must be allowed to thrive. We may also need to consider the protection of both consumers themselves and human-created works (including our history) as part of a conservation effort before extractive models permanently pollute our shared cultural resources.</p>
<p>The way the political winds are blowing right now in the US, significant legal reform seems unlikely for now. Things may need to get much worse before they get better. But the kind of extractive lock-in we’re seeing with technology is fundamentally incompatible with freedom in my opinion, so something needs to change if we still value the kind of personal liberty the PC once promised—that freedom to explore, create, and make mistakes without surveillance or punishment.</p>
<p>Sure, things will never be perfect in the United States. Profits will always be chased, and there will be collateral damage. And yes, some parts of technology today are better than ever (computing power, screen resolutions, and bandwidth to name a few).</p>
<p>The Internet has brought amazing things, including Wikipedia, The Internet Archive, multiplayer online gaming, <em>VC&amp;G</em>, and work-from-home jobs. But the urge to exploit users to the maximum extent through digital locks and surveillance should be held in check so that we can earnestly and honestly make the tech industry a beacon of optimism once more.</p>
<p>The stakes are higher now than they were in the 1970s. There is no “logging off,” nearly everyone has a smartphone in their pocket, and the digital world increasingly overlaps with every aspect of our lives. That means digital freedom is now equivalent to actual legal and personal freedom, and we must be allowed to control our own destinies.</p>
<p>Whether through purposeful reform or the eventual collapse of digital strip mining, I believe the personal computer will eventually rise again—–along with our chance to reclaim control of our digital lives.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://iamvishnu.com/posts/please-dont-force-dark-mode">https://iamvishnu.com/posts/please-dont-force-dark-mode</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42762054">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <blockquote>
  <p>Dear website designers,</p>

  <p>Please don’t force dark mode on your users. If dark mode is a characteristic of your brand, please ensure you choose a comfortable contrast ratio for the text.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I regularly see many websites including personal blogs that are designed exclusively in dark mode. I find this incredibly frustrating as I can’t even read a single paragraph on these sites before my eyes start watering. While dark mode can be beneficial on some occasions, forcing it on users is a terrible user experience.</p>

<h2 id="my-eyes-my-eyes-">My Eyes! My Eyes! 😵‍💫</h2>

<p>Reading in dark mode doesn’t just mess with my eyes while I’m at it — it sticks around afterward too. Every time I finish a long article, I end up seeing horizontal stripes everywhere I look, like my eyes just won’t let it go.</p>

<p><strong>This is what my eyes see before reading a dark-mode article:</strong>
<img src="https://iamvishnu.com/images/dark-mode/before-reading-dark-mode.jpeg" alt="what I see before reading dark mode - a normal sight"></p>

<p><strong>And this is what my eyes see after reading a full-length dark-mode article:</strong>
<img src="https://iamvishnu.com/images/dark-mode/after-reading-dark-mode.jpeg" alt="what I see after reading in dark mode - full of horizontal stripes everywhere for a considerable amount of time"></p>

<h2 id="whats-the-real-problem-with-the-dark-mode">What’s the real problem with the dark mode?</h2>

<p>The real problem is the <strong>contrast ratio</strong> between the text and the background when using dark mode.</p>

<p>For example, pure white text on a pitch black background can strain my eyes and be very difficult to read. The contrast ratio of this combination is <strong>21:1.</strong> Here’s an example paragraph:</p>

<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</p>

<p>However, light gray text on a dark gray background is easy on my eyes. Here the background is <code>#666</code> and the text is <code>#E0E0E0</code> which creates a contrast ratio of <strong>4.34:1</strong>.</p>

<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</p>

<p>In summary, higher contrast ratios in dark mode cause discomfort for my eyes. But when I say ‘higher’, just how high can it go?</p>

<h2 id="isnt-there-a-guidelines-for-this">Isn’t there a guidelines for this?</h2>

<p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1 recommends a <strong>minimum</strong> contrast ratio of <strong>4.5:1</strong> for normal texts <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum">(SC 1.4.3)</a> <strong>but not a maximum.</strong> The current guidelines makes pure white text on pitch black background completely accessible, even if the contrast ratio is an unbearable 21:1. But the more comfortable contrast ratio of 4.34:1 from the above example fails according to the guidelines. That means, currently, there are no standards or guidelines that address contrast ratios in dark mode.</p>

<p>Upcoming WCAG 3.0 adds a new exploratory requirement for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#maximum-text-contrast">“Maximum text contrast”</a> and I hope the working committee will address the issue of high contrast text in dark mode and provide suitable recommendations.</p>

<p>Until then, if I must read an important article that forces dark mode, I will use the browser’s developer tools to override the CSS and invert the colors until a better solution is available. I don’t want to use a plugin just for this.</p>

<hr>

<p>That being said, I absolutely enjoy dark mode when…:</p>
<ul>
  <li>…reading on an OLED screen in a unlit room, for example reading articles on my phone before bedtime. Dark mode works best on LED-type displays when used in dark environments.</li>
  <li>…writing code. Almost every IDE has a dark mode with very comfortable contrast ratio out of the box.</li>
  <li>…the website has comfortable contrast ratio in the dark mode.</li>
</ul>

to ask why Twitter is such a big deal.</p><p>The reason is that it's a new messaging 
protocol, where you don't specify the recipients.
New protocols are rare.  Or more precisely, new
protocols that take off are.
There are only a handful of commonly used ones: TCP/IP 
(the Internet), SMTP (email), HTTP (the web), and so on.  So any
new protocol is a big deal.  But Twitter is a protocol owned
by a private company.  That's even rarer.</p><p>Curiously, the fact that the founders of Twitter 
have been slow to monetize it may in the long run
prove to be an advantage.  Because they haven't tried
to control it too much, Twitter feels to everyone like
previous protocols.  One forgets it's owned by a
private company.  That must have made it easier for
Twitter to spread.</p></span></td></tr></tbody></div></div>]]></description>

Thankfuly, as of now this market request is starting to be fulfilled by the likes of Google, Apple with cooperation of access system manufacturers and providers like HID, Brivo, Salto, WaveLynx, Nedap, Kisi, Assa Abloy, but ubiquitous support is far from reality, moreover those official solutions require manual approval, incur additional (in some cases absolutely cuckoo $$$) fees.</p>
<p dir="auto">The search for a potential bypass had lead some people into the topics of <a href="https://github.com/kormax/apple-vas">VAS</a>, <a href="http://github.com/kormax/apple-enhanced-contactless-polling">ECP</a> and HCE API (which actually exists in IOS, but is private, used by VAS), but those solutions don't work with existing reader infrastructures.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The solution</h2><a id="user-content-the-solution" aria-label="Permalink: The solution" href="#the-solution"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">May be deemed more elegant than some people could expect.<br>
It lies in one of the Chinese transit card brands, called "China T-Union", that is officially supported by Apple Wallet.</p>
<p dir="auto">
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/kormax/apple-device-as-access-card/blob/main/assets/WALLET.INFO.TUNION.webp"><img src="https://github.com/kormax/apple-device-as-access-card/raw/main/assets/WALLET.INFO.TUNION.webp" alt="![T-Union card in wallet]" width="250px"></a>
</p>  
<p dir="auto">At first look there's nothing special about this card type, it has the same charachteristics as any transit card in Wallet:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It has a viewable balance;</li>
<li>It has configurable express mode;</li>
<li>It can be freely moved between devices.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">What makes this card powerful, lies in the way it changes how NFC behaves on your device when it's set as a default transit card:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Your device stops randomizing the UID on each tap;</li>
<li>Your device begins responding to all NFC readers as if they were express-transit enabled, just like on Android;</li>
<li>Also this card does not change its serial number and UID when moving to other devices, unlike most other ones.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">All those properties are unique to this card type and cannot be replicated with any other card type, and coincidentally <strong>they make it ideal for usage in access systems that use the UID of the card as the only means of authentication</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now, it's time to talk about the downsides. This is a point that might break the hopes for a lot of people:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Thing is, UID-only authentication is deemed <strong>very unsecure</strong>, and thus is uncommon in real-life installations. Some installations allow UID auth in a fallback/compatability mode, which is more common.</li>
<li>You cannot control the UID of the card that will be generated for you, this means that you'll still need to ask permission of the system owner to add your UID into it, a chance of getting a collision would be too little and too expensive to verify.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Following systems are known to have UID-based authentication:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://wiki.ui.com/2-0/docs/ua-nfc-cards" rel="nofollow">UniFi Access</a> with the "UniFi Access Credentials Only" setting disabled;</li>
<li>[Needs expanding].</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In case the stars align in your case, a next question would be how to aquire such a card. Next section tries to answer that question.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The solution for solution</h2><a id="user-content-the-solution-for-solution" aria-label="Permalink: The solution for solution" href="#the-solution-for-solution"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">China T-Union cards are quite hard to get, as if you've tried adding one straight from Wallet, you've probably encountered an error message telling you that you have to have a Chinese UnionPay card. Emphasis on Chinese, as global variants aren't accepted too.</p>
<p dir="auto">To overcome this problem, you have to have following prerequisites:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometric_passport" rel="nofollow">A Biometric travel document</a>;</li>
<li>A valid Mastercard or Visa.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">(NOTE) Google says that many people are having issues with SMS verification, so this method might not be working now. In this case the only thing left is to wait for this issue to resolve.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you have everything, follow the next steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Install the AliPay app;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Register inside the AliPay app:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Verify your mobile phone;</li>
<li>When asked, set up the PIN. <strong>Warning</strong> it is very important not to forget any of the codes, as you'll irreversibly lose access to your account;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Verify your identity:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Select "Account" tab;</li>
<li>Tap on the profile avatar;</li>
<li>Select "My Namecard";</li>
<li>Press "Verify identity";</li>
<li>Choose "Complete verification".</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">After that, you'll be presented with a couple of possible age verification methods.<br>
Depending on your country one of them may work for you.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="link_wrapped_content">




<p>For more than three decades, the TrackPoint’s iconic red rubbery nub has been a staple of IBM and Lenovo ThinkPad laptops. But now, no longer. Lenovo has removed its famous TrackPoint from its latest ThinkPad laptops, calling it time for a change.</p>



<p>Does that mean the TrackPoint is dead? No, thankfully. It will still appear in the other ThinkPads made by Lenovo, said a company spokesman. But for the 14- and 15-inch ThinkPad X9 Aura Editions launched at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, the TrackPoint has been removed entirely.</p>



<p>The idea is that certain laptops — let’s say the Dell XPS — have managed to transcend the consumer, prosumer, and small business markets, and the TrackPoint is a legacy design, according to Lenovo. “That doesn’t resonate with all demographics, so to speak,” said the company’s spokesman. “That was cutting-edge technology at one time. But clearly, it’s a touchpad world.”</p>



<p>In the past, Lenovo had defended the TrackPoint as a reason to avoid using the trackpad itself. The TrackPoint debuted with the IBM ThinkPad 700, which launched in 1992. Then, in a 2017 TechRadar <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569483&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.techradar.com/news/why-the-thinkpad-trackpoint-still-a-thing-according-to-lenovos-chief-designer&amp;xcust=2-1-2566195-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2566195/lenovo-has-removed-its-iconic-trackpoint-nub-from-new-thinkpad-laptops.html" rel="nofollow" data-subtag="2-1-2566195-1-0-0-0-0" data-domain-name="techradar" target="_blank">interview</a>, Lenovo’s chief design officer David Hill described the TrackPoint as a way for a user to access a pointing device without the need for the user’s hands to leave the keyboard’s home row.</p>

		
			
			


<figure><p>
<iframe title="Is A ThinkPad A ThinkPad Without The Nub?" width="500" height="281" src="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nHIu-ezVKRs?feature=oembed"></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>But he also foreshadowed Lenovo’s choice to remove the TrackPoint, too. “It’s a little bit like an automatic transmission versus a stick shift. If you know how to drive a stick, you don’t want an automatic transmission,” Hill said back then in the interview. “If you don’t drive a stick shift, you’re not going to buy a car that’s got one.”</p>



<h2 id="features-and-specs-for-lenovos-new-thinkpad-aura-editions">Features and specs for Lenovo’s new ThinkPad Aura Editions</h2>



<p>Lenovo’s new ThinkPad X9 14 Aura Edition ($1,399 and up, shipping in Feb. 2025) and the ThinkPad X9 15 Aura Edition ($1,549 and up, shipping in Feb. 2025 as well) are both laptops built around the vPro versions of the Intel Core Series 2 “Lunar Lake” mobile processor. Neither ships with discrete graphics, relying on Intel’s Arc Xe integrated GPU.</p>


<div><figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:false,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-2568494&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Lenovo ThinkPad Aura 14&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Lenovo ThinkPad Aura 14&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250105_132931.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad Aura 14" width="1200" height="900" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Mark Hachman / IDG</p></div>



<p>However, it’s lovely to see that Lenovo is moving premium display technologies mainstream. The 14-inch offers a choice between a 1920×1200 400-nit 60Hz OLED or a 14-inch 2880×1800 500-nit 120Hz OLED. The 15-inch model offers just the latter option, with an average HDR600 capability on top. Up to 32GB of LPDDR5X memory and 2TB of a PCIe Gen 4 SSD are also included.</p>



<p>These are Thunderbolt 4 laptops with two ports, as Intel doesn’t offer integrated Thunderbolt 5 solutions quite yet. Underneath the laptop is what Lenovo calls an “engine hub” that houses the critical components, with the Thunderbolt ports sprouting from both sides. Lenovo says that this engine hub will be serviceable by a trained repairperson. Wi-Fi 7 is also included and the laptop is also MIL-SPEC 810H qualified.</p>


<div><figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:false,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-2566206&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: Lenovo ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Lenovo ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/16_ThinkPad_x9_14_Front_facing_B_C_cover.png?w=1200" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition" width="1200" height="1200" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Lenovo</p></div>



<p>Lenovo isn’t specifying battery life quite yet, though with a battery-sipping Lunar Lake processor inside, it should be fantastic. The 14-inch model includes a 55Wh customer-replaceable battery, for a total weight of 2.74 pounds. The 15-inch includes a whopping 80Wh battery, for a total weight of 3.19 pounds. Lenovo used over 50 percent recycled aluminum in the aluminum chassis and various levels of recaptured plastics in other components.</p>



<p>By contrast, the similar <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2493146/asus-zenbook-s-14-review.html">Asus ZenBook S 14</a> includes a Lunar Lake processor alongside a 72Wh battery and a 14-inch 2880×1800 touchscreen 120Hz OLED, which yielded over 17 hours of simulated work in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2236466/how-we-test-laptops-pcworld.html">our laptop battery tests</a>.</p>



<h2 id="lenovos-ai-now-adds-smart-modes">Lenovo’s AI Now adds smart modes</h2>



<p>We’re always on the lookout for applications that can take advantage of localized AI. With the Aura Edition laptops, Lenovo has provided two sets of such features: the Lenovo Aura Edition features on the one hand, and what Lenovo is calling Lenovo AI Now on the other.</p>


<div><figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:false,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-full&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-2566208&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: lenovo ces 2025 ai now &quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;lenovo ces 2025 ai now &quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lenovo-ces-2025-ai-now_1.png" alt="lenovo ces 2025 ai now " width="720" height="500" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Lenovo’s AI Now offers both local and cloud-based AI.</figcaption></figure><p>Lenovo</p></div>



<p>Lenovo Aura Edition includes “smart modes” that allow users to switch between optimized device configurations like “Attention,” “Power,” and “Wellness.” They sound like they’re designed a bit like the optional Windows configurations, emphasizing entertainment, for example. Smart Care connects users to device diagnostics and 24/7 live agent support. Smart Share is a Lenovo-branded version of <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2168557/intel-beefs-up-intel-unison-app-with-cross-platform-controls.html">Intel’s Unison technology</a> for sharing information between Android and iOS devices.</p>



<p>Lenovo AI Now is an optional LLM that’s based on Meta’s Llama 3.0, which processes all data locally using the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2457268/what-the-heck-is-an-npu-anyway-everything-you-need-to-know.html">integrated Lunar Lake NPU</a>. Lenovo also promises new features coming soon: multilingual support, searching across the PC as well as the tablet, plus improved capabilities to extract data from documents, images, or even portions of the two.</p>


<div><figure data-wp-context="{&quot;uploadedSrc&quot;:false,&quot;figureClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-block-image size-large&quot;,&quot;figureStyles&quot;:null,&quot;imgClassNames&quot;:&quot;wp-image-2566209&quot;,&quot;imgStyles&quot;:null,&quot;targetWidth&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;targetHeight&quot;:&quot;none&quot;,&quot;scaleAttr&quot;:false,&quot;ariaLabel&quot;:&quot;Enlarge image: 10 65W USB C Travel Dock Floating left&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;10 65W USB C Travel Dock Floating left&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/10_65W_USB_C_Travel_Dock_Floating_left.png?w=1200" alt="10 65W USB C Travel Dock Floating left" width="1200" height="1200" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Lenovo’s USB-C travel dock.</figcaption></figure><p>Lenovo</p></div>



<p>Lenovo also promises new peripherals to go along with the new laptops, including $49 TWS Earbuds (X9 Edition) with Bluetooth 5.3; a 65W GaN Nano Adapter; a $99 X9 Charging GaN Dock with a 4K60 HDMI port, SD card reader, and USB-A/C ports; and a $59.99 X9 Edition of a wireless mouse that includes a dedicated AI Now button. The earbuds and adapter are available now and the dock will ship in June 2025.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><time datetime="{updatedAt}">Updated on: <!-- -->January 19, 2025</time><p><img src="https://smallstep.imgix.net/tiny_ca_4ab20bb2d1.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;fit=max&amp;q=50" alt="tiny-ca.png"></p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> In this tutorial, we're going to build a tiny, standalone, online Certificate Authority (CA) that will mint TLS certificates and is secured with a YubiKey. It will be an internal ACME server on our local network (ACME is the same protocol used by <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Let's Encrypt</a>). The YubiKey will securely store the CA private keys and sign certificates, acting as a cheap alternative to a Hardware Security Module (HSM). We'll also use an open-source True Random Number Generator, called <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/13-37/infinite-noise-trng/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Infinite Noise TRNG</a>, to spice up the Linux entropy pool.</p>

<ul>
<li>Because end-to-end TLS is great and you should easily be able to run TLS wherever you need it. Especially in your homelab. Internal networks are no longer perceived as a safe zone where unencrypted traffic is okay. But you need certificates.</li>
<li>Because TLS client authentication is becoming <a href="https://smallstep.com/hello-mtls" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">more widely supported in different services</a>, and it's a lot better than passwords. But you need certificates.</li>
<li>Because the ACME protocol (used by Let's Encrypt) can easily be deployed internally, so you can automate renewal and never have to think about your certificates.</li>
<li>Because maybe you've done the 'self-signed certificate' rigmarole with OpenSSL a dozen times already. Might as well formalize things and get your devices to trust a CA that you can use wherever you need it.</li>
<li>Because setting up a simple CA is a great learning experience.</li>
<li>Still not convinced? Spin up a free hosted homelab CA using our <a href="https://smallstep.com/certificate-manager" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Certificate Manager offering</a> instead.</li>

<li>On your laptop, burn the <a href="https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/22.10/release/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ubuntu 22.10 Server</a> <a href="https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/22.10/release/ubuntu-22.10-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi.img.xz" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">64-bit ARM pre-installed server image</a> onto the microSD card using the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Raspberry Pi Imager</a>.</li>
<li>Fire up the Raspberry Pi, plug it into your network, and find its initial IP address.
You can run <code>arp -na | grep -e "b8:27:eb" -e "dc:a6:32" -e "e4:5f:01"</code> to discover Raspberry Pi devices on the local network.</li>
<li>Login via SSH (username and password will be <code>ubuntu</code>), and change the password.</li>
<li>Set the hostname via <code>hostnamectl set-hostname tinyca</code></li>
<li>Set the timezone using <code>timedatectl set-timezone America/Los_Angeles</code> (or whatever your timezone is; <code>timedatectl list-timezones</code> will list them all)</li>
<li>Be sure NTP is working. Check status with <code>timedatectl</code>— make sure "NTP Service" is "active". If not, you can add some NTP servers to <code>/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf</code> and run <code>systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd</code>.</li>
<li>You'll need the machine to have a DNS name (for me it's <code>tinyca.internal</code>) and/or a static IP on your network.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you have good time synchronization and a stable hostname, we can proceed.</p>

<p>You'll need to install both <code>step-ca</code> (the CA server software) and <code>step</code> (the command used to configure and control <code>step-ca</code>).</p>
<p>First, download <a href="https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/releases/latest" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the source for <code>step-ca</code></a> and <a href="https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/configuration#yubikey" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">build it with experimental YubiKey support enabled</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/13-37/infinite-noise-trng" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Infinite Noise TRNG</a> is an open-source USB True Random Number Generator. It uses a "modular entropy multiplier" architecture to generate a <em>lot</em> of random data quickly. For this setup, a daemon will continuously feed entropy into Linux's system entropy pool by writing to <code>/dev/random</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>But will this lovely new entropy generator actually be used by the CA?</strong> I needed to answer two questions here:</p>
<ol>
<li>How does the CA generate random numbers? I had to dig around a little to confirm this. <code>step-ca</code> uses Go's <code>crypto/rand</code> for all of its key generation, and <code>cyrpto/rand</code> uses <code>/dev/urandom</code> as its random data source on Linux systems.</li>
<li>Does the entropy created via writing to <code>/dev/random</code> actually affects what is read from <code>/dev/urandom</code>? It does—because Linux has only one entropy pool, shared by <code>/dev/random</code> and <code>/dev/urandom</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We also need to confirm that the outboard TRNG is actually generating high quality noise. We'll do that in a minute.
You'll need to <a href="https://github.com/13-37-org/infnoise/releases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">compile the driver from source</a>, because there's no pre-built <code>arm64</code> package available.</p>

<p>Now, plug in the TRNG and restart your system.</p>
<pre><section><code><pre>$ sudo reboot
</pre></code></section></pre>
<p>After a restart, you should see that the driver has started up. It will start and stop based on whether the TRNG is present.</p>

<p>Finally, let's run a health check to make sure the TRNG is ready for use:</p>
<pre><section><code><pre>$ infnoise --debug --no-output
Generated 1048576 bits.  OK to use data.  Estimated entropy per bit: 0.878415, estimated K: 1.838354

^C
</pre></code></section></pre>
<p>Entropy is written to <code>/dev/random</code> by <code>infnoise.service</code> every second. You're all set on randomness! Now that you have more than enough entropy, you're ready to generate your CA keys.</p>
<h2 id="part-2-creating-your-pki">Part 2: Creating Your PKI<a href="#part-2-creating-your-pki"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M13.828 10.172a4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-4 4a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.102-1.101m-.758-4.899a4 4 0 005.656 0l4-4a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.1 1.1"></path></svg></a></h2>
<p>Now you'll create your root and intermediate CA certificates and keys, and store them securely on the YubiKey.</p>
<p>Ideally, your Raspberry Pi should be kept offline for this section. Disconnect the Ethernet cable, and connect directly to the device via HDMI and a keyboard.</p>
<h3 id="prepare-a-usb-thumb-drive-for-storing-the-private-keys">Prepare a USB thumb drive for storing the private keys<a href="#prepare-a-usb-thumb-drive-for-storing-the-private-keys"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M13.828 10.172a4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-4 4a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.102-1.101m-.758-4.899a4 4 0 005.656 0l4-4a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.1 1.1"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>You can't just have your CA private keys live <em>only</em> on the YubiKey. You'll want at least one backup of them, in case the YubiKey breaks!</p>
<p>Insert a USB thumb drive. You'll generate the keys directly on this drive, so that they never touch the Pi's microSD card. First, find the device name of your USB drive:</p>
<pre><section><code><pre>$ sudo fdisk -l
...

Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
...
</pre></code></section></pre>
<p>In this case, the drive is <code>/dev/sda</code>. Let's initialize it with a single <code>ext4</code> partition:</p>
<pre><section><code><pre>$ sudo fdisk /dev/sda

<p>Great, now you're ready to create your Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Specifically, you'll be creating CA keys and certificates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tiny CA PKI Highlights</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tiny CA has a root CA key and certificate, and an intermediate CA key and certificate.</li>
<li>The root CA key signs the Intermediate CA certificate.</li>
<li>The root CA certificate is self-signed (signed with the root CA key)</li>
<li>The intermediate CA key will sign all of your TLS certificates.</li>
<li>By default, <code>step-ca</code> issues certificates with a 24-hour lifetime. I hope this default will compel you to <a href="https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/renewal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">set up automated renewal</a> on your clients. And you can always increase the TLS certificate duration in the CA configuration, if you want something a bit more relaxed.</li>
<li>If a device is configured to trust your root CA, it will trust certificates you create with <code>step-ca</code>.</li>
<li>You can throw away the root CA key if you never need another intermediate.</li>
<li>Need a refresher on X.509 certificates? See our post, <a href="https://smallstep.com/blog/everything-pki/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Everything you should know about certificates and PKI but are too afraid to ask</a>.
Use a strong password when prompted, and save your password separately, offline, somewhere super duper safe.</li>

<p>Don't forget to give your CA a cute name! It will appear on all of your certificates. Hold onto your root fingerprint, too; you'll need it to bootstrap your clients later.</p>

<p>OK! Now you'll copy out the CA certificate files, leave the private keys on the USB stick, and continue creating your CA.</p>
<pre><section><code><pre>$ sudo cp /mnt/ca/certs/intermediate_ca.crt /mnt/ca/certs/root_ca.crt /root
$ cd
$ sudo umount /mnt
</pre></code></section></pre>
<p>Finally, reconnect your CA to your local network to continue the setup.</p>

<p>You're going to re-run <code>step ca init</code> now, but <em>you're not going to use the certificates or keys that it generates</em>.
You're just doing this to create the configuration files.
The password you choose when prompted will be your <em>admin provisioner password</em>.
Anyone with this password will be able to administer your CA and get any certificate from it,
using the <code>step ca certificate</code> subcommand.</p>
<p>Don't use your root CA password for your provisioner,
but pick something strong and store it somewhere safe.</p>
<pre><section><code><pre>$ sudo useradd step

</pre></code></section></pre>
<p>Next, let's get your certificates in place.</p>
<pre><section><code><pre>$ sudo mv /root/root_ca.crt /root/intermediate_ca.crt /etc/step-ca/certs
$ sudo rm -rf /etc/step-ca/secrets
</pre></code></section></pre>
<p>Next, you'll need to configure <code>step-ca</code> to use your YubiKey to sign certificates, using the intermediate key on the YubiKey. Notice that the default YubiKey PIN (<code>123456</code>) is shown here, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should change your YubiKey PIN, PUK, and management key if you haven't already! <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/Guides/Device_setup.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Learn how in this guide.</a>
Now edit the file <code>/etc/step-ca/config/ca.json</code>. You'll want the top of the file to look like this:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><section><code><pre><span>{</span>
        <span>"root"</span><span>:</span> <span>"/etc/step-ca/certs/root_ca.crt"</span><span>,</span>

</pre></code></section></pre>
<p>Now you'll start up the CA and make sure it's running properly:</p>
<pre><section><code><pre>$ sudo chown -R step:step /etc/step-ca
$ sudo -u step step-ca /etc/step-ca/config/ca.json

</pre></code></section></pre>
<p>In another window, you'll generate a test certificate for localhost.
This is where you'll need the CA fingerprint, which is displayed when you start up the CA. Run:</p>
<pre><section><code><pre>$ step ca bootstrap --ca-url "https://tinyca.internal" --fingerprint d6b3b9ef79a42aeeabcd5580b2b516458ddb25d1af4ea7ff0845e624ec1bb609
The root certificate has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.step/certs/root_ca.crt.
Your configuration has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.step/config/defaults.json.
$ step ca certificate "localhost" localhost.crt localhost.key
✔ Provisioner: you@example.com (JWK) [kid: izgi9tn1YWbVnY_rmIUKzE-Dn-XIuKz-_J1dnnKeDRA]
✔ Please enter the password to decrypt the provisioner key:

$ step certificate inspect localhost.crt --short
X.509v3 TLS Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 2903...3061]
  Subject:     localhost
  Issuer:      Tiny Intermediate CA
  Provisioner: you@example.com [ID: izgi...eDRA]
  Valid from:  2023-02-16T23:03:52Z
          to:  2023-02-17T23:04:52Z
</pre></code></section></pre>
<p>Great! You just signed your first X.509 TLS leaf certificate using the YubiKey and <code>step-ca</code>.</p>
<p>When you ask the CA to issue a leaf certificate for a TLS endpoint, you'll get a certificate file and a (locally-generated) private key file.  The certificate file will contain both the intermediate CA certificate and the leaf certificate you requested. This way, a device which trusts your root CA can verify the chain of trust from the root to the intermediate, and from the intermediate to the leaf.</p>
<p>Finally, you'll add an ACME provisioner, which will turn your Tiny CA into a tiny Let's Encrypt!</p>
<pre><section><code><pre>$ step ca provisioner add acme --type acme --admin-name step
No admin credentials found. You must login to execute admin commands.
✔ Provisioner: you@example.com (JWK) [kid: izgi9tn1YWbVnY_rmIUKzE-Dn-XIuKz-_J1dnnKeDRA]
Please enter the password to decrypt the provisioner key:
</pre></code></section></pre>
<p>Sign in with your admin password, and your new new ACME provisioner will be created.</p>
<p>You can now shut down the <code>step-ca</code> process you started in the other terminal window.</p>
<h3 id="configure-systemd-to-start-the-ca">Configure <code>systemd</code> to start the CA<a href="#configure-systemd-to-start-the-ca"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M13.828 10.172a4 4 0 00-5.656 0l-4 4a4 4 0 105.656 5.656l1.102-1.101m-.758-4.899a4 4 0 005.656 0l4-4a4 4 0 00-5.656-5.656l-1.1 1.1"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>In this section you'll set up a systemd service for <code>step-ca</code> so it starts when the system starts up.
You'll also configure systemd to stop the CA when the YubiKey is removed, and restart it when the YubiKey is reinserted.
First, you need to tell <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Udev" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">udev</a> about your YubiKey by adding some udev rules, which will help make the YubiKey visible to systemd as a device.</p>
<pre><section><code><pre>$ sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/75-yubikey.rules &gt; /dev/null &lt;&lt; EOF
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{PRODUCT}=="1050/407/*", TAG+="systemd", SYMLINK+="yubikey"
ACTION=="remove", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{PRODUCT}=="1050/407/*", TAG+="systemd"
EOF
$ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
</pre></code></section></pre>
<p>Here, the format of the <code>ENV{PRODUCT}</code> value is <code>{vendorId}/{productId}/*</code>. Yubico's vendor ID is <code>1050</code>, and <code>407</code> is the product ID for the YubiKey 5 NFC. If you're using a different YubiKey, <a href="https://devicehunt.com/view/type/usb/vendor/1050" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">you can find your model number here</a>.</p>
<p>Now you'll <a href="https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/certificate-authority-server-production#running-step-ca-as-a-daemon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">set up the CA as a systemd service</a> that will:</p>
<ul>
<li>run on system startup, when the YubiKey is inserted</li>
<li>stop when the YubiKey is removed</li>
<li>start again when the YubiKey is reinserted</li>
</ul>

<p>Now insert the YubiKey and the service should start:</p>

<p>Now restart your system and ensure that the CA starts up automatically.</p>
<p>Test out removing the YubiKey, and you should see that the CA stops.</p>
<p>Reinsert it, and the CA should start up again.</p>

<p>When you run <a href="https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/bootstrap" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>step ca bootstrap</code></a> (as above) on a new device,
the root certificate <code>root_ca.crt</code> is downloaded from the CA.
If you run <code>step ca bootstrap --install --ca-url=https://your.ca --fingerprint=your-ca-fingerprint</code>,
it will install the root certificate into your device's trust store.</p>
<p>You can also use the <code>step</code> command for easy installation of your root CA certificate (<a href="https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/certificate/install" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>step certificate install</code></a>),
for ACME enrollment (<code>step ca certificate example.com example.crt example.key --provisioner acme</code>)
and for renewal of any certificate that hasn't yet expired (<code>step ca renew example.crt example.key</code>).</p>
<p>For mobile devices, you can usually install a certificate by sending it to yourself via Bluetooth or AirDrop, or as an email attachment. Make sure the certificate isn't just installed, but actually trusted by the device. This usually involves a couple of confirmation steps on the device.</p>

<p>Now that you have an internal CA, here's a few useful resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>To get more familiar with the <code>step</code> command and how it interfaces with your CA, try out some of the examples in <a href="https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/basic-certificate-authority-operations" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Basic Certificate Authority Operations</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://smallstep.com/hello-mtls" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hello mTLS</a> shows you how to get mutual TLS authentication configured for several common services and programming languages, using the <code>step</code> command.</li>
<li>There's also a lot to learn about the different provisioners you can add to your CA to suit your workflows.
See <a href="https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/configuration" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Configuring <code>step-ca</code></a>.</li>
<li>Bonus: Want to use SSH certificates?
You can turn your tiny CA into an SSH CA, and use certificates and single sign-on for your SSH hosts.
We have a <a href="https://smallstep.com/blog/diy-single-sign-on-for-ssh/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhxLRlcNUM4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">video walk-through</a> that describes how to set it up.</li>
