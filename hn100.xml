<h3>Introduction: Back to the Future</h3>
<p>In the 1989 blockbuster <i>Back to the Future II</i>, time travel enables Michael J. Fox’s nemesis, Biff, to become a gazillionaire by bringing an almanac with sports match outcomes back from the future. We thought it might be instructive, and certainly entertaining, to make a less fanciful version of this dream a reality – for a few lucky people.</p>
<p>In November 2023, we ran an in-person, proctored experiment involving 118 young adults trained in finance. We called the experiment “The Crystal Ball Challenge.” We gave each participant $50 and the opportunity to grow that stake by trading in the S&amp;P 500 index and 30-year US Treasury bonds with the information on the front page of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) <i>one day in advance,</i> but with stock and bond price data blacked out. The game covered 15 days, one day for each year from 2008 to 2022.</p>
<p>You can play this game for yourself here: <a href="https://elmwealth.com/crystal-ball-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crystal Ball Trading Challenge</a> – though without the pecuniary component. As of the time of writing, over 1,500 people have tested their skill and luck by playing the game on our website.</p>
<h3>Summary of results</h3>
<p>The players in the proctored experiment did not do very well, despite having the front page of the newspaper 36 hours ahead of time. About half of them lost money, <i>and one in six actually went bust.</i> The average payout was just $51.62 (a gain of just 3.2%), which is statistically indistinguishable from breaking even. The poor results were a product of: 1) not guessing the direction of stocks and bonds very well, and 2) poor trade-sizing. The players guessed the direction of stocks and bonds correctly on just 51.5% of the roughly 2,000 trades they made. They guessed the direction of bonds correctly 56% of the time, but bet less of their capital on bonds than on stocks (if you’re planning a career as a proprietary macro trader, consider putting your focus on bonds).</p>
<p>Perhaps the front page of the WSJ isn’t a particularly clear crystal ball, or our players weren’t very adept at reading it. As former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein reminded us in a widely-circulated tweet, sometimes the markets don’t react to the news as even seasoned experts expect – an important lesson all successful traders learn, eventually.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://elmwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/115-crystal-ball-image02.png"></p>
<p>It didn’t help that the players also did not seem to know how to size their bets well. On eight of the 30 trading opportunities,<span id="easy-footnote-2-11523"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-11523" title=" 15 days with one stock and bond trading opportunity each.<br />"><sup>2</sup></a></span> the players in aggregate displayed 2-to-1 odds of being correct in their bets, but they did not bet more heavily on those occasions. Overall, they did not display trade-sizing that bore any relation to their propensity to guess the price moves of stocks or bonds correctly.</p>
<p>Many of the players used excessive leverage relative to their exhibited edge in guessing market direction. On about 30% of the total number of days on which players traded, they used leverage of greater than 20x capital. On 4% of the total occasions, they used leverage of 60x or higher, which carried a very high probability of being wiped out if they guessed wrong. In sum, there was little discernible logic or rationale to their trade-sizing decisions.</p>
<p>See Appendix I for a detailed analysis of player results.</p>
<p>Perhaps this excessive risk-taking by some of the players is partially explained by the finding that most investors tend to overestimate the predictive value of news on market outcomes. For example, a recent survey of 11,000 investors by Andre et al.<span id="easy-footnote-3-11523"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-11523" title=" Andre, P. et al. (2023). &amp;#8220;Mental Models of the Stock Market.&amp;#8221; <i>SSRN.</i><br />"><sup>3</sup></a></span> found that about 70% of investors (but not finance academics) believed that stale, four-week-old, good (or bad) news was predictive of high (or low) future stock returns.</p>
<p>However, our sample of 118 staked and proctored players did better than the roughly 1,500 people who have played the game for fun on our website. The median outcome among these players was a loss of about 30% of their capital. Only 40% finished with a profit, and 36% went bust.</p>
<p>We were tickled to see that six players devoted themselves to achieving the maximum possible payout, growing their initial wealth 70,575-fold. They did this by repeatedly playing the game to see what stocks and bonds did on each day, and then using that information to put up the perfect score by correctly betting the maximum size on each trade. We were elated to see our game spark so much passion in some players!</p>
<h3>Some of the world’s best traders show how to do better</h3>
<p>We invited five seasoned and successful macro traders – four men, one woman – to play the game, with markedly better results. This was a very select group of traders: head of trading at a top-five US bank, founder of a top-ten macro hedge fund, senior trader at a top-ten macro fund, former senior government bond trader at top-three US primary dealer, and former senior Jane Street trader.</p>
<p>These players all finished with gains. On average, they grew their starting wealth by 130%, with a median gain of 60%. All of the players were selective and highly variable in their trade-sizing. They did not bet at all on about 1/3 of the trading opportunities, but bet big on days when they presumably felt confident in the impact of the news on stock or bond prices.<span id="easy-footnote-4-11523"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-11523" title=" Despite their relatively strong performance, several of these traders told us they found the game much more challenging than they thought it would be.<br />"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>
<p>These veteran traders predicted the direction of the markets significantly better than our 118 younger, less experienced participants (63% vs 51.5%), but mostly we ascribe the dramatically different results to the much more rational trade-sizing displayed by the experienced traders. One important conclusion we reach is that there is little value in this crystal ball <i>without sensible trade-sizing.</i></p>
<h3>Motivations</h3>
<p>In addition to our curiosity in testing Taleb’s hypothesis, we had four further motivations for conducting this experiment:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are deeply interested in learning how people approach the sizing of attractive investment opportunities, having researched and written extensively on this topic. In 2016, we conducted an experiment (also involving financial rewards) where we invited participants to bet on a digital coin flip that was programmed to have a 60% probability of landing on heads, and published our findings in “<a href="https://www.pm-research.com/content/iijpormgmt/43/3/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Betting on a Biased Coin</a>.” We recently wrote a book, <i>The Missing Billionaires: A Guide to Better Financial Decisions</i>, that is focused on investment sizing.</li>
<li>We wanted to quantify the value of macro-economic information. How often would people guess the direction of markets from the information on the front page of the WSJ?</li>
<li>We hoped that the tool we developed for the experiment could be productively used to educate and train professional risk-takers.</li>
<li>It was going to be a lot of fun!</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Game</h3>
<p>Over 90% of the participants were in graduate programs in finance or MBA programs with finance modules at four east coast US universities with low admission rates. The participants were not told in advance that they’d be invited to participate in this experiment. Any who did not want to participate were allowed to leave (though no one did).</p>
<p>Here’s how we explained the rules of the game:</p>
<div>
<p>We are giving you $50 to play our “Crystal Ball” game. The object is to see how well you can do trading stocks and bonds if you know the news from the front page of the WSJ one day in advance. In other words, you’ll be in that dreamed-of position of being a trader who “knows the future.” For example, you will be shown the front page of the WSJ for a Wednesday, and be able to take a long or short position in the stock market and in the bond market at prices prevailing at Monday’s close (that is, two days earlier). Your trades will be liquidated at Tuesday’s closing prices. Note, on each front page we’ve blacked out anything that tells you explicitly what market prices actually did that day – leaving that information in would make this game too easy and no fun at all!</p>
<p>You will be trading the S&amp;P 500 stock market index and a 30-year US Treasury bond futures contract, and you can use as much leverage as you’d like to, up to 50x. Use the sliders to choose the positions you want and then click the “Trade” button. Remember that for the 30-year Treasury bonds, prices go down when yields go up, and you are trading on price.</p>
<p>You are starting off with $50 of bankroll, and we will pay you however much this has grown to, or shrunk to, with a maximum payout of $100. You will have 45 minutes to play the game.</p>
<p>We have not chosen these days to try to trick you – they are randomly chosen. You will be able to trade on 15 different days, once per year over the past 15 years. The days will be presented to you in a randomized order. We’ve chosen these days randomly from a set of days where one third of them are days of employment reports, one third from days of Fed announcements, and the other third purely randomly, all taken from days that are in the top half of days ranked by overall market volatility. You can use the “Skip” button to skip any day you don’t feel like trading, and you can trade stocks, bonds, or both, each day. You can use the “Finish” button if you want to stop before being presented with all 15 days. Leverage of 1x means your position size is equal to your capital size. There are no transaction costs or overnight financing costs or rebates on your trades.</p>
<p>Good luck, and have fun – you may never have this opportunity again!</p>
</div>
<p>Below are two pictures of the screens that players engaged with. In the first screen, the player can expand the picture of the front page of the WSJ on the left to be able to read it more clearly, then revert to the trading page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://elmwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/115-crystal-ball-image03.png"></p>
<p>Then, after clicking “Trade” the result of the trade is revealed, showing the market move in stocks and bonds, and the resultant profit or loss. The player’s bankroll is expressed based off of a starting value of $1 million, but the players understood that their payout would be $50 times the ending wealth divided by $1 million, with a minimum of $0 and a maximum of $100.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://elmwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/115-crystal-ball-image04.png"></p>
<p>All the front pages can be seen here, in chronological order: <a href="https://elmwealth.com/crystal-ball-gallery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://elmwealth.com/crystal-ball-gallery/</a></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>“He who lives by the crystal ball will eat shattered glass.” — Ray Dalio</p>
<p>Was Taleb correct in his conjecture that “If you give an investor the next day’s news 24 hours in advance, he would go bust in less than a year”? While our experiment didn’t test his statement precisely – we only gave players 15 days of front pages, players were risking just $100 in the game, etc. – by and large we think Taleb is right. His counterintuitive proposition is both insightful and instructive.</p>
<p>The financial industry is replete with individuals and organizations constantly working to develop their own proprietary crystal balls. We hope that the experiment and results described herein convince crystal ball makers that sensible investment-sizing is essential to realizing the value of what they are trying to build.</p>
<p>The poor aggregate showing of our 118 financially-trained participants highlights the importance of educating young, aspiring finance industry professionals in decision-making under uncertainty, and particularly the theory and art of investment-sizing. We hope our Crystal Ball game will be a helpful tool – or a prototype for a better one – that educators and financial firms can use to teach these concepts and skills. Perhaps it may even become part of the hedge fund boot camp training programs at Citadel, Point72, Balyasny, and Jane Street that have been in the news recently.<span id="easy-footnote-5-11523"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-11523" title=" Kumar, N. and Tetley, L. (June 19, 2024). <a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-19/giant-hedge-funds-citadel-and-point72-are-trying-to-create-the-perfect-trader&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>&amp;#8220;Hedge Fund Talent Schools Are Looking for the Perfect Trader.&amp;#8221;</a> Bloomberg.<br />"><sup>5</sup></a></span> The uniformly positive results of the five experienced macro traders we invited to play the game suggest that there are teachable skills involved in successful discretionary investing.</p>
<p>Perhaps Matt Levine foresaw the results of our experiment with his article titled: “Knowing the Future Isn’t That Helpful.”<span id="easy-footnote-6-11523"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-11523" title=" Levine, M. (November 29, 2024). <a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-26/knowing-the-future-isn-t-that-helpful&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>&amp;#8220;Knowing the Future Isn’t That Helpful.&amp;#8221;</a> Money Stuff.

(2020). &amp;#8220;The Signal Quality of Earnings Announcements: Evidence from an Informed Trading Cartel.&amp;#8221;<br />"><sup>7</sup></a></span> The traders bought earnings announcements before they were released from an international hacker group that illegally obtained access to the servers of three commercial newswire companies. These traders were sophisticated and their crystal ball was gem quality, but their batting average was far from perfect – though it was still good enough to make a decent return on their capital…before they were caught by the SEC!</p>
<p>Most stories involving people seeing into the future, like that of the trading cartel above, don’t have “happily ever after” endings. There are usually unintended consequences that come with perfect prescience – a reminder that even prophets can’t escape risk and uncertainty. The best we mortals can do is make our decisions with a framework that explicitly accounts for the presence of risk in just about every big choice we face.</p>

<h3>Appendix I: Detailed Analysis of Player Results</h3>
<p>Below is a chart showing the distribution of payouts to the players. The average payout was $51.62 per player, representing a weighted average return across all the players of 3.2%.<span id="easy-footnote-8-11523"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-8-11523" title=" The players who went bust actually finished with a negative balance. The average player return is 0% if we account for the busted players finishing with a debit balance, but of no more than 25% of their starting capital. The average return would go from 0% to 3.8% if we also capped player outcomes at +125% rather than +100%.<br />"><sup>8</sup></a></span> About half (45%) the players lost money, and 16% went bust, about the same as the 20% that maxed out at $100. We suspect most readers will agree with us in rating this performance “not very impressive.” It seems that getting the front page of not-any-old-newspaper, but <i>the</i> WSJ, 36 hours ahead of time (albeit with market moves redacted) may not be as valuable as many of us might have imagined.</p>
<p>An experienced market participant is likely able to extract more information from the front page of the WSJ than someone with less experience, such as the participants in our experiment. Even though direct reporting of market moves was blacked out, journalists often report the news biased by how markets reacted after the news. For example, they’ll refer to an employment report as “weak” if the bond market rallies after the report, even if the actual report is more ambiguous – for example, a slightly low number of jobs created, countered by a drop in the unemployment rate and a rise in hourly earnings.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://elmwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/115-crystal-ball-chart01.png"></p>
<p>The players forecast the correct direction of stocks and bonds 51.5% of the time. With stocks, they got the correct direction on 48.2% of their trades, and on 56.2% of the bond trades. Notice there were four days where more than 70% of the players forecast the correct direction of the market, and 10 days when more than 60% were correct. However, the players placed 40% more trades in stocks than bonds, which is unfortunate given the players had a better realized edge with bonds than stocks. The table below describes each of the 15 trading opportunities and shows how many trades the players placed on each of the days and what percentage of the trades were placed in the correct direction: long when the market went up and short when it went down.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://elmwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/115-crystal-ball-table01.png"></p>
<p>The next table puts the focus on trade-sizing. It shows the average leverage used for each trading day for stock and bond trades, and also the averages conditional on being higher than 5x leverage. Average leverage used in stock and bond trades was 13x and 10x respectively, and two times as much – 22x and 20x – for trades where leverage was greater than 5x.</p>
<p>We calculated the correlation of leverage (i.e. trade size) for each day versus the win percent for each day, and found a zero correlation in the case of stock trades and a -0.1 correlation for bond trades, along with a +0.2 and -0.1 conditional on leverage used being greater than 5x. It seems that our players on average did not follow a strategy of placing bigger trades on those that they had a higher probability of getting right. Perhaps this is due to them not knowing which ones they had a higher probability of getting right, or perhaps they were not following a disciplined sizing strategy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://elmwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/115-crystal-ball-table02.png"></p>
<p>The players traded 2,067 times, for an average of about 18 trades per player. The maximum number of trades each player could have made is 30, which would entail doing a stock and bond trade for every front page. Some of the 40% shortfall versus the maximum number of trades is due to 16% of the players going bust, but most of the shortfall is from players abstaining from trading opportunities.</p>
<p>Players were more apt to take long positions in stock and bonds; they traded stocks 62.5% of the time as a long position, and 59.6% of the time for bonds. About 10% and 8% of the players were long stocks and bonds, respectively, for every trade they made.<span id="easy-footnote-9-11523"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-9-11523" title=" These players seemed to be expressing a view that the WSJ front page from the future held no valuable information. Or perhaps they were heeding another warning from Taleb: &amp;#8220;To bankrupt a fool, give him information.&amp;#8221; from The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms.<br />"><sup>9</sup></a></span></p>
<h3>Unpacking player performance</h3>
<p>What accounts for the underwhelming 3.2% return of the players? The fact that our players guessed the direction of stocks and bonds correctly only 51.5% of the time seems to be a pretty big handicap to overcome. It seems the front page of the WSJ wasn’t a particularly clear type of crystal ball for our players to read, and/or they weren’t very good at reading it.</p>
<p>However, even with their weak ability to read the tea leaves, the players could have done quite a bit better if they applied a sensible and constant amount of leverage to all their trades. It would have been reasonable for the players to have estimated the daily standard deviation of stocks and bonds, given our description of how we chose the 15 days, at around 1.5% – 2% for stocks and 1% – 1.5% for bonds. They might have then considered that there could easily be a two or three sigma event in the sample, and so the maximum amount of leverage they could use with a low likelihood of being wiped out might have been 8x for equities and 12x for bonds, if betting on both at the same time.</p>
<p>With that maximum leverage in mind, the next step would be to find the optimal size, subject to the maximum constraint above, given their view of the expected return and risk of the trades.<span id="easy-footnote-10-11523"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-10-11523" title=" For a fuller discussion of trade-sizing, see chapters 2 &amp;#8211; 7 of our book, <i>The Missing Billionaires: A Guide to Better Financial Decisions</i>. Wiley. (2023).<br />"><sup>10</sup></a></span> One reasonable choice would have been to apply the Kelly criterion. While the implicit risk-aversion embedded in the Kelly criterion is lower than most people’s risk-aversion with regard to their total wealth, it is reasonable to use it here given the amount of money involved was small relative to the players’ total wealth.</p>
<p>If the players felt they had a 55% chance of being right (an overestimate, as it turned out), that would have suggested something like 6x leverage for stocks and 8x leverage for bonds,<span id="easy-footnote-11-11523"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-11-11523" title="For Kelly, we use <i>SR / σ</i>, using <i>SR = 0.1</i>, daily <i>σ<sub>stocks</sub> = 1.75%</i> and <i>σ<sub>bonds</sub> = 1.25%</i>, giving us stocks at <i>0.1 / .0175 = 6</i>x, and bonds at <i>0.1 / .0125 = 8</i>x.<br />"><sup>11</sup></a></span> assuming profits on these trades would be uncorrelated. The optimal size would be a bit lower assuming some positive, but not perfect, correlation in trade outcomes.</p>
<p>If the players had all changed their trade-sizing such that they leveraged all their trades as suggested above (6x for stocks and 8x for bonds), they’d have generated an average return of 10%. Another sign that this is better sizing of trades is that outcomes amongst the players would have had about 45% less dispersion: only 4% of the players would have lost more than 50% of their stake, compared to about 28% in the actual trial. None would have lost more than 75%, and hence, none would have gone bust – recall that 16% of our participants did just that. So, the participants in aggregate would have done better with more reasoned trade-sizing, particularly on the downside…but not tremendously better (and we’d have been 7% more out-of-pocket).</p>
<p>The actual leverage used by participants was, on average, much higher than 6x and 8x for stocks and bonds – generally, people tended to use more leverage in their stock trades than in their bond trades, which is inconsistent with stocks being more volatile than bonds combined with their ability to forecast stock movements being weaker than their skill in guessing bond movements.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the chart below, on about 30% of the days that players traded, they used leverage greater than 20x, and on 4% of the days, they used total leverage of 60x or higher. And on 17 occasions – just over 1% of days traded – players went for 100x leverage, which exposed the player to close to a 50% chance of total loss of capital. It seems clear that there was a fair amount of over-sizing of trades.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://elmwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/115-crystal-ball-chart02.png"></p>
<p>However, a much bigger improvement could have been attained from the players doing a better job discerning when they had a more accurate reading of the future. If they’d scaled their trades bigger when they were more likely to be right, they’d have done much better, but it’s hard to know if, on the days when a high percentage of players put on the correct trades, if they really did have a stronger conviction that they were going to be right. It was clear which days were employment and Fed announcement days, and it turns out that the players were more accurate in their readings for bond movements on those days with a 58% hit ratio, while on the other third of the days they only had a 50% hit ratio.</p>
<p>The players also could have done much better if they had based their forecasts on a simple set of rules around the news that was on those front pages. They’d have been correct about 60% of the time if they had shorted bonds whenever the balance of news items was in the direction of a stronger economy, higher inflation, higher energy prices, a stronger Euro or a less accommodating Fed, and vice versa for the opposite news. For stocks, players also would have been correct about 60% of the time if they went long stocks when the balance of news items was in the direction of stronger economy, lower inflation, higher energy prices, a stronger Euro or a more accommodating Fed, and if they went short stocks when the balance of news items was in the opposite direction. There were several days when there was no news of the above variety or there were an equal number of news items on each side of the ledger. In those cases, abstaining from trading would have been a sensible decision.</p>
<p>The table below shows the results from applying the simple trade decision rules described above for direction and sizing. This approach had a success rate of 58% for stocks and 64% for bonds, resulting in an average 6.1% return on each trading day and a 2.4x growth of the bankroll.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://elmwealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/115-crystal-ball-table03.png"></p>
<p>As a further test of our hypothesis that this Crystal Ball would bear fruit for players with more experience in connecting news to markets and in sensible trade-sizing, we had five senior bank and hedge fund traders play this game.<span id="easy-footnote-12-11523"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-12-11523" title=" Unproctored, but we are confident we can rely on their integrity, and their natural curiosity, to have played the game straight.<br />"><sup>12</sup></a></span> Their average end wealth was 2.3x their starting wealth, ranging from 1.2x to 5.6x. None went bust, and their average trade success ratio was about 63%. As was the case with the main sample of players, these experienced traders also did substantially better with bonds (71% correct) than with stocks (56%).</p>

<h3>Appendix II: Putting a value on the crystal ball</h3>
<p>How much should an investor be willing to pay for a crystal ball that gives them the front page of the WSJ one day in advance, on 15 high-volatility days? In general, when investors are allocating their capital to attractive opportunities with optimal sizing, the risk-adjusted return they are expecting to earn is roughly one half of the expected return.<span id="easy-footnote-13-11523"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-13-11523" title=" Both expressed in excess of the safe asset return, and with a few other assumptions about random walks, ability to rebalance positions continuously and frictionlessly, and ignoring taxes.<br />"><sup>13</sup></a></span> Let’s say that, when we do a trade, the average expected return to risk ratio of the trades is 0.2. This is twice as high as we were suggesting for our participants, and consistent with a 60% chance of getting the direction of the market correct.</p>
<p>For an investor with a typical degree of risk-aversion,<span id="easy-footnote-14-11523"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-14-11523" title=" Twice as risk-averse as implied by the Kelly criterion.<br />"><sup>14</sup></a></span> he should risk 10% of his capital on a one standard deviation outcome of such a trade, assuming the trade is uncorrelated with the rest of his investments.<span id="easy-footnote-15-11523"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-15-11523" title=" And that the outcomes are normally distributed, and that he can rebalance his exposure to keep his leverage constant.<br />"><sup>15</sup></a></span> His expected return on the trade is then 2% <i>(0.2 * 10% = 2%)</i>, and his risk-adjusted return is about 1% per trade. In practice, there needs to be a further reduction for managing the leverage that will be employed, but let’s leave that to the side for the purposes of this example.</p>
<p>The final step is to estimate how many times we expect the crystal ball to give us useful news. Let’s say it’s 75% of the time. Then, our risk-adjusted wealth grows by 1% for each of the 24 trades we expect to do, resulting in certainty-equivalent wealth 1.27x our initial wealth <i>(1.01<sup>24</sup> = 1.27)</i>. This tells us that the most we can pay for this crystal ball is 21% of our wealth <i>(1 – 1/1.27 = 21%)</i>.</p>
<p>Another useful perspective on the value of the crystal ball is to compare the risk-adjusted value of getting the newspaper in advance once per year versus being able to invest in the stock market for the whole year. The Sharpe ratio of one day’s trades driven by the crystal ball reading is around 0.2 – 0.3 (perhaps much less depending on who is doing the reading) which is less than what most people believe is the typical Sharpe ratio of one year’s worth of investing in the stock market.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Appendix III: Caveats and shortcomings of this study</h3>
<p>As with most studies involving paying relatively nominal sums to university students, it’s natural that players’ behavior with a $50 starting bankroll would be very different from how they would use this crystal ball if they could trade on their total wealth.</p>
<p>Players may have done much better if they’d been given company-specific information ahead of time and been allowed to trade individual stocks with that information. Several players told us that they felt the crystal ball would have been much more useful if they knew more about the context of the front page news, in particular what the market was primarily concerned about at the time.</p>
<p>The maximum leverage allowed in our game is higher than most investors can access through futures. However, out-of-the-money options do provide a viable alternative, though with considerably higher costs. Also, we assumed that the players could hold on to their trades until the following day’s close. It’s possible that in some cases, the intraday move in the markets may have wiped out the player’s capital before the next close.</p>
<p>In practice, it is unlikely investors would leverage their total wealth without a limit on the worst-case outcome they could experience. Two effective ways to limit losses from leveraged investments are: 1) putting the trades in a limited liability vehicle, where losses are limited to the capital therein, or 2) buy short-term out-of-the-options to limit the maximum loss on the leveraged trades. Option 1 has the drawback that it may not be possible to get the desired amount of leverage, and Option 2 involves the costs associated with the options contracts.</p>

Foremost are the contributions of our research associate James Cross, who helped design and single-handedly programmed the Crystal Ball game during the summer of 2023 while still an undergraduate at Princeton. We thank our long-time research collaborator Richard Dewey for his guidance in designing the study and interpreting the results. Jason Zweig of the Wall Street Journal got us off the ground, and introduced us to ASU Professor Rawley Heimer, whose experience in designing and running studies similar to ours was invaluable. We owe a debt of gratitude to our many friends and colleagues, who as always, did their best to clarify and vet our analysis, and in many cases to be guinea pigs for the study: Jerry Bell, Larry Bernstein, Mimi Duff, Fash Golchin, Jessica Haghani, Joshua Haghani, Mark Haghani, Larry Hilibrand, Alex Imas, Spencer Jakab, Agustin Lebron, Saman Majd, Bill Montgomery, Andy Morton, Vladimir Ragulin, Chris Rokos, Jeffrey Rosenbluth and Steven Schneider. If this research has merit, much of the credit goes to them, although all errors are our own. We thank Nassim Nicholas Taleb for his insightful observation that gave birth to this line of inquiry. Finally, our heartfelt thanks go to the roughly 1,500 people who took time from their busy lives to pit their wits and luck against our Crystal Ball challenge.<br><a href="#easy-footnote-1-11523"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-2-11523"></span> 15 days with one stock and bond trading opportunity each.<br><a href="#easy-footnote-2-11523"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-3-11523"></span> Andre, P. et al.

	      <p>IRATA.ONLINE is provided for the benefit of retro-computing users to have a place to socialize, and
		develop interesting multi-user, interactive, and graphical games and social applications. It descends
		from the historical PLATO system, a massive time-sharing system that lasted from 1962 until
	        NovaNET was closed in 2015. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLATO_(computer_system)">Wikipedia entry.</a></p>
	      <p>It is vital that communities grow, and to that end, IRATA.ONLINE is part of a rebirth of the PLATO system
		that started with the launching of <a href="http://cyber1.org/">Cyber1.org</a> in 2004, and is the direct
		result of the efforts of that community to provide a distribution of the PLATO system that could be run
		on other systems. IRATA.ONLINE
		was initially intended to provide users of Atari 8-bit computer systems a customized experience that
		was easy to use. It is hoped that with the introduction of more PLATO terminals for other platforms that
		IRATA.ONLINE's reach can extend even further.</p>
	      <p>Where will it go? Who knows. This is an experiment to provide something better than a BBS, by
		making something that is not only multi-user, but provides a complete social development experience
		for its users.</p>

              <h2>TECH</h2>
	      <h3>How do I make a terminal for this service?</h3>
	      <p>The Protocol that IRATA.ONLINE uses is an ASCII based protocol developed for PLATO.
		it is ASCII in that it uses 7-bit characters and does not use the 8th bit of the byte.
		The protocol is completely documented in the "s0ascers" document, provided both below
		and accessible using either author mode or Go in the menu system. If you wish to make
		terminal software to access this service, this document is most useful.</p>
	      <p><a href="https://irata.online/assets/s0ascers-045c83081e9ada2008378c3ae6aa62564b213a71decf9fe04608909b91d20ad1.html">S0ASCERS Document (HTML format)</a></p>
	      <p><a href="https://irata.online/assets/s0ascers-87929471a98d4887004e2afbbade675d77d53320f8112d9dbbe95fd433949564.txt">S0ASCERS Document (ASCII text format)</a></p>
	      <h4>Example Terminal Code</h4>
	      <p>To help foster adoption of the service, alongside the protocol implementation documentation
		above, and the pterm source code, also above. Steve Peltz also provided example implementations
		of a classic 68K Macintosh terminal (MacPAD) and a Sun SPARC terminal (XPad), both of these
		are sample implementations written in easy to understand C, that can be brought over to bootstrap
		other terminal program efforts. A big thank you to Steve Peltz.</p>

	      <h4>Micro Tutor Source Code</h4>
	      <p>While not needed, it is possible for PLATO terminals to receive code from IRATA and execute it locally, possibly while interacting with code running on IRATA. A Micro Tutor interpreter exists within PTerm 6.0, and thus can be used to run Micro-Tutor lessons, and with appropriate implementations on other processors (6502, 6809, 68000, etc.), Micro-TUTOR could be extended to a wide variety of retro-computing systems. Source code in assembly for the Z80 Micro-Tutor interpreter is below:</p>
	      <p><a href="http://www.control-data.info/plaopl_source.zip">Micro-PLATO Source Code extracted from IRATA's filesystem</a></p>
	      <p><a href="http://drs.ddns.net/index/mtutor/mtutorCompleteLvl2.zip">Complete Level-2 Micro-TUTOR source code</a></p>
	      <p><a href="http://drs.ddns.net/index/mtutor/ppttutLvl4.zip">The core interpreter for Micro-TUTOR level 4</a></p>
	      <h3>How do I write software for this service?</h3>
	      <p>IRATA.ONLINE like all PLATO systems, utilizes the TUTOR language for the majority of its
		programs and lessons. It is a very simple language to learn, and is designed to leverage
		the unique aspects of the service. The editor, debugger, and visual editors needed to make
		excellent programs for this service, are all built in, and available to users that ask for
		an Author sign-on. </p>
	      <p>There is also the <b>=0introtut=</b> lesson available from the Help menu and in
		author mode, as well as the <b>=aids=</b> lesson, which serves as a reference guide.</p>
	      <p>In addition, the fine folks at bitsavers.org and control-data.info provided a copy of
		<i>The Tutor Language</i> in PDF format, so you can teach yourself TUTOR quickly!</p>

In 1950, the quickest lap around it had been done at an average speed of 102.7 mph. Four years later, a Jaguar and a Ferrari both surpassed 115 mph. In 1955, Ferrari’s Eugenio Castellotti demolished that record during practice, hitting 118.56 mph. The flat-out speeds achieved in practice were equally astonishing, with Juan Manuel Fangio, the driver widely agreed to be the world’s best, getting his Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR up to 181.57 mph on the 3.6-mile Mulsanne Straight.</p><p>After two years away from sportscar racing, Mercedes had returned with a masterfully engineered new machine. One of its drivers at Le Mans that year, John Fitch, later described the 300 SLR as “a ferocious racing car” with “a staggering complexity of parts.” Its body was made of ultralight magnesium alloy; <em>Motor Sport</em> reported that its fuel-injected 3-liter engine emitted an “unholy scream.” One month earlier, Fangio and the 25-year-old English driver Stirling Moss had powered theirs to a one-two finish at the Mille Miglia. In the hands of elite drivers like these, it seemed almost unbeatable.</p></div><div><div data-w-id="143281a4-5fd8-da83-2fe9-8357ea78b16e" data-ix="new-interaction-2"><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767581b9540b731343869_DDMD2H.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 100vw, (max-width: 1439px) 44vw, 650px" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767581b9540b731343869_DDMD2H-p-500.jpg 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767581b9540b731343869_DDMD2H-p-800.jpg 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767581b9540b731343869_DDMD2H-p-1080.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767581b9540b731343869_DDMD2H-p-1600.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767581b9540b731343869_DDMD2H-p-2000.jpg 2000w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767581b9540b731343869_DDMD2H-p-2600.jpg 2600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767581b9540b731343869_DDMD2H-p-3200.jpg 3200w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767581b9540b731343869_DDMD2H.jpg 5085w" alt=""></p><div><p>Alfred Neubauer (Left) with Juan Manuel Fangio (Center). </p><p>Heritage Image Partnership Ltd / Alamy</p></div></div><div><p data-w-id="ca0f7162-993c-8bfa-82e7-e87e8c793677"><h2>Though notoriously grueling for car and driver, Le Mans was not considered all that dangerous.</h2></p><p>The 300 SLR was virtually identical to the company’s championship-winning W196 Formula 1 car. Like Ferrari and others, though, Mercedes dubiously classified it as a consumer “prototype” in order to enter it at Le Mans. The disparity between these specialized racers and the slower production models on the track rankled some. For the second year running, Austin-Healey had withdrawn its team of near-standard production cars in protest over the proliferation of bogus “prototypes.” For many others, though, the enormous gap in vehicle capabilities was just another defining element of the classic race also known as <em>La Ronde Infernale</em>.</p><p>Though notoriously grueling for car and driver, Le Mans was not considered all that dangerous. The eight-mile circuit had been rebuilt in 1949 to modern specifications after the old track was destroyed by German bombing. In the six years since, four drivers had been killed there, an unremarkable number by period standards. Tunnels ran under the track so that spectators could cross safely, and the viewing areas were protected by four-foot-tall earthen barriers.</p></div></div><div><p>Some of the best action was to be seen at the start-finish line, where a straightaway encouraged dramatic overtakes as other cars entered and exited the pits. A handful of naysayers had begun to complain that this section of the racecourse was unsafe. The quarter-mile-long pit area was undivided from the main track; it was also narrow, with no deceleration lane, and a right kink leading up to it gave harried drivers one more thing to think about as they approached this busy area at speed. Mercedes team director Alfred Neubauer later claimed that he had, for this reason, warned his drivers to pull over well in advance when pitting. Some of Neubauer’s fears were confirmed during the Wednesday evening test drive, when a DB-Panhard entering the pits collided with Moss’s Mercedes. French driver Jean Behra, who was standing nearby with two journalists, sustained head and leg injuries that prevented him from racing for Gordini that weekend.</p><p>Another topic of discussion leading up to the race was the hinged fap that Mercedes had attached to the rear deck of its cars. The driver pulled a dashboard lever to raise it, creating drag and an additional boost of stopping power that was sure to come in handy at the end of the Mulsanne Straight, where the dramatic comedown from speeds of around 180 mph created overtaking opportunities. An impressed Moss called the system “unbelievable,” but it left rivals confused. Seeing a Mercedes “wind brake” flip up for the first time, a Porsche driver assumed the car’s trunk latch had broken. Others complained that it obstructed their views on corners. The night before the race, Mercedes complied with an official request to cut a second Plexiglas window in its metal braking faps. This sort of compromise was typical during an age of motorsport in which teams were free to conduct experiments, including strange ones, and worry about the safety implications later.</p></div><div data-w-id="430014d9-f525-4071-0a52-ef86b180800f"><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/67376758fb4b94598694220a_E0RC52.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 92vw, (max-width: 767px) 90vw, (max-width: 1439px) 92vw, 1320px" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/67376758fb4b94598694220a_E0RC52-p-500.jpg 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/67376758fb4b94598694220a_E0RC52-p-800.jpg 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/67376758fb4b94598694220a_E0RC52-p-1080.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/67376758fb4b94598694220a_E0RC52-p-1600.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/67376758fb4b94598694220a_E0RC52-p-2000.jpg 2000w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/67376758fb4b94598694220a_E0RC52-p-2600.jpg 2600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/67376758fb4b94598694220a_E0RC52-p-3200.jpg 3200w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/67376758fb4b94598694220a_E0RC52.jpg 5575w" alt=""></p><div><p>Mike Hawthorn pictured at Silverstone in 1956. </p><p>Keystone Press / Alamy</p></div></div><div><p>Mercedes’ wind brakes were its answer to the powerful disc brakes used by Jaguar, whose highly aerodynamic D-Type was one of the other fastest cars on the circuit. Jaguar had become a force at Le Mans in recent years, winning in 1953 and losing to Ferrari by less than three minutes in 1954. For Jaguar, the fact that it had no Formula 1 team made the 24 Hours an especially important prize.</p><p>Its star driver in 1955 was 26-year-old Englishman Mike Hawthorn. Fangio had decimated the Grand Prix competition the year before with Mercedes, but Hawthorn, racing for Ferrari, had finished third. People were still talking about the French Grand Prix of 1953, when he’d won a sixty-lap duel against Fangio by a single second after overtaking the unflappable Argentine on the last corner.</p></div><div><div><p>The six-foot-two Hawthorn was blonde, handsome, rowdy, and stylish. His habit of wearing butterfly-shaped bow ties in the cockpit had earned him the nickname Le Papillon. His Jaguar teammate Norman Dewis later remembered him as “genuinely debonair.” Hawthorn embraced the oftrack hedonism that was typical of the era. He liked beer and women, and often disappeared after a day of driving to indulge in both, sometimes with carousing buddies who drove for other teams. These included Moss and the lesser-known Lance Macklin, who was also competing at that year’s Le Mans. Macklin had a privileged and well-traveled background; he’d spent part of his childhood in Monte Carlo, attended Eton, and gone to college in Switzerland. Though talented, the playboyish Macklin had never taken the profession as seriously as Moss or Hawthorn. “Sometimes it was a nightmare to make him practice at all,” one of his Aston Martin teammates later recalled. “If there was some blonde he was after, he just wouldn’t show up.”</p><p>One of the best results of Macklin’s career had been at Le Mans, in 1951, when he’d logged a third-place finish in an Aston Martin. The Austin-Healey 100S he’d secured for 1955 was a private entry, since the manufacturer’s team was once again sitting out the race. Macklin’s was the first Austin-Healey to be outfitted with disc brakes, but these were far less impressive than the Jaguar’s, and the experienced Macklin was realistic about his prospects. He could compete with other roadsters, but one of his main tasks would be to keep out of the way of faster cars like Hawthorn’s.</p></div><div data-w-id="56f44674-a9cc-ae78-18da-432399729355" data-ix="new-interaction-2"><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767865f2f6a4a6a6e340a_1017471912-LAT-19550611-C43741.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 92vw, (max-width: 767px) 90vw, (max-width: 991px) 92vw, (max-width: 1439px) 44vw, 650px" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767865f2f6a4a6a6e340a_1017471912-LAT-19550611-C43741-p-500.jpg 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767865f2f6a4a6a6e340a_1017471912-LAT-19550611-C43741-p-800.jpg 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767865f2f6a4a6a6e340a_1017471912-LAT-19550611-C43741-p-1080.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767865f2f6a4a6a6e340a_1017471912-LAT-19550611-C43741-p-1600.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767865f2f6a4a6a6e340a_1017471912-LAT-19550611-C43741-p-2000.jpg 2000w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767865f2f6a4a6a6e340a_1017471912-LAT-19550611-C43741-p-2600.jpg 2600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767865f2f6a4a6a6e340a_1017471912-LAT-19550611-C43741.jpg 3000w" alt=""></p><div><p>The “wind brake” in action on Fangio/Moss Mercedes. </p><p>LAT Photographic</p></div></div></div></div><div data-w-id="72e8d0f8-997c-42a1-41df-3d146436203c"><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/67362975ffe2bf9fea09cfbf_184340153113.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 92vw, (max-width: 991px) 90vw, 800px" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/67362975ffe2bf9fea09cfbf_184340153113-p-500.png 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/67362975ffe2bf9fea09cfbf_184340153113-p-800.png 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/67362975ffe2bf9fea09cfbf_184340153113-p-1080.png 1080w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/67362975ffe2bf9fea09cfbf_184340153113-p-1600.png 1600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/67362975ffe2bf9fea09cfbf_184340153113.png 2000w" alt=""></p><div><p>Memories of the war were still fresh in the minds of the public. </p><p>Francois Mori / AP</p></div></div><div><div><p>Hawthorn’s celebrated French Grand Prix victory over Fangio had been in a Ferrari. This time around, he was driving a British car against a German one, and there was more national pride involved. Hawthorn’s anti-German prejudice was one of his defining passions. He was known to confront British motor enthusiasts and chew them out for buying “bloody Kraut cars,” and when driving himself to races in Germany, he timed his refueling stops to avoid buying gas in a country that he still, in many ways, viewed as the enemy. These feelings were no secret; they were, in fact, probably the reason that Neubauer had never approached him about driving for Mercedes and had signed Moss instead.</p><p>Nor was this sentiment unique to Hawthorn. Memories of the war were still fresh in the minds of the public; Nazis had imprisoned French resistance fighters in an internment camp just a few miles away from the Circuit de la Sarthe. The prospect of a Le Mans victory for Mercedes, the German powerhouse, ignited national sentiment in the French and British that can be hard to appreciate today. Aware of these sensitivities, Neubauer had assembled a six-man driving team for Le Mans that included just two Germans, Karl Kling and Hans Herrmann. Its biggest stars were Fangio and Moss. Its biggest curiosity was a 49-year-old Frenchman named Pierre Levegh.</p><p>Levegh was known to French racing fans, and his selection made sense from a PR perspective. Otherwise, the balding Parisian garage owner was a surprising choice. He was past his prime, and he hadn’t exactly distinguished himself in his prime, either. He had, however, shown himself to be capable of near-greatness at Le Mans.</p></div><div><p>Levegh had dreamed of winning the prestigious French race since adolescence. He’d attended every edition of Le Mans since 1930 and, beginning in 1938, had driven in it six times. After failing to secure a car for the first two postwar races, he had co-driven a factory Talbot to a fourth-place finish in 1951. The following year, aged 46, Levegh entered a Talbot that he’d done all the work on himself – and insisted on going the distance alone. When dawn broke on Sunday morning, many of the other fastest cars had retired, leaving Levegh and his Talbot with an astonishing three-lap lead. Each time he came in for refueling, he refused to hand the wheel over to his increasingly frustrated partner. His mileage total surpassed 2,000. He was 70 minutes away from glory, and borderline catatonic from exhaustion, when his car stopped running. Shortly after his race ended, Levegh was seen lying motionless on the grass behind the pits with a rug draped over him. Most chroniclers report that he made a shifting error that destroyed his crankshaft, although this account is disputed. Levegh himself never explained what happened.</p><p>That year, Mercedes finished first and second in front of a devastated and somewhat hostile French crowd. (The next year, the rules were changed to limit each driver’s time at the wheel to 18 hours.) The politically astute Neubauer, who’d brought all German drivers that year, made a mental note to put Levegh in a Mercedes when the team returned to Le Mans. When it did, in 1955, he followed through, pairing Levegh with another amateur driver, an American named John Fitch. Unlike the rest of the Mercedes team, Fitch got to know Levegh a little during the lead-up to the race. The Frenchman had a “habitually solemn demeanor,” he later wrote, and a “general air of deep reflection.” He spoke no English, and it only added to his air of somber mystery that Pierre Levegh was not his real name. He had changed his name from Pierre Bouillin to Pierre Levegh as a young man, in tribute to an uncle who’d been a race car driver – and originally, it was said, to keep his mother from knowing about the dangerous hobby he’d taken up.</p><p>Though he was generally not one for mingling, Levegh confided to Fitch before the 1955 Le Mans that he felt uncomfortable in the SLR. When the head of the Mercedes press department, Arthur Keser, teased Levegh for his oversized crash helmet, the Frenchman was unamused. It was the type worn by American fighter pilots, he explained, and offered “special protection.”</p><p>The Mercedes drivers Levegh, Fitch, Kling, and André Simon (a Frenchman who’d been brought in last-minute as a replacement for the injured Hermann) were expected to circulate, not win. These lower-tier drivers would be racing in the shadow of the 300 SLR being piloted by Moss and Fangio, a dream team that gave Mercedes even more of a presumptive edge against Ferrari and Jaguar. Hawthorn, for his part, had more confidence in his own abilities and his D-Type than he did in his co-driver, Ivor Bueb, who was competing in his first endurance race. Surely whatever small lead he could gain over Mercedes would start to disappear once the drivers swapped. Fangio took the first stint in his Mercedes car. Neubauer spat on the ground to wish him luck.</p></div></div><div data-w-id="7a9032a7-7a6a-56b8-4262-13ed44d741bb"><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673628907bb5067c9a3c5c32_2E26521.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 92vw, (max-width: 991px) 90vw, 800px" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673628907bb5067c9a3c5c32_2E26521-p-500.jpg 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673628907bb5067c9a3c5c32_2E26521-p-800.jpg 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673628907bb5067c9a3c5c32_2E26521-p-1080.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673628907bb5067c9a3c5c32_2E26521-p-1600.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673628907bb5067c9a3c5c32_2E26521-p-2000.jpg 2000w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673628907bb5067c9a3c5c32_2E26521-p-2600.jpg 2600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673628907bb5067c9a3c5c32_2E26521-p-3200.jpg 3200w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673628907bb5067c9a3c5c32_2E26521.jpg 3548w" alt=""></p><div><p>Drivers sprinting to their cars at the start of the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans. </p><p>Shawshots / Alamy</p></div></div><div><div><div><p>The drivers dashed across the pits and into their cars at 4 p.m. exactly.

Then he overtook Maglioli, in full view of the grandstand crowd, at the end of another record lap.</p><div><p>Ten new lap records would be set – by Castellotti, Fangio, and Hawthorn – within the first two hours. The pace at the front was bone-rattling, more like a Grand Prix than an endurance race, and spectators were transfixed. Around the grandstand area and elsewhere, they stood on tables, chairs, and boxes in order to get a better view over the four-foot-tall earth barriers.</p><p>Half an hour in, the top three cars had pulled away from the next-fastest group and begun lapping others. At 5:10 p.m., 70 minutes into the race, Castellotti’s foot slipped off his brake pedal. As he struggled to avoid spinning out, Hawthorn, and then Fangio, overtook him.</p></div><p>The race now became a duel for the ages, with Hawthorn fighting tenaciously to stay ahead. Fangio took the lead and promptly lost it. He took the lead again on the 18th lap and held it longer, causing Hawthorn to succumb to a moment of mental weakness. Hawthorn later recalled thinking that it was perhaps inevitable for him to be overtaken by a man-and-machine combo as awesome as Fangio in a 300SLR. “Then I came to my senses and thought: ‘Damn it, why should a German car beat a British car?’” He reclaimed the lead on the Mulsanne Straight.</p><p>The battle between Hawthorn and Fangio that kicked off that year’s Le Mans was all the more compelling because it represented a “clash of personalities,” Neubauer later wrote. “The small, wiry Argentinian took the bends with consummate artistry, never risking too much, yet never losing the slightest chance. The fair-haired Englishman, on the other hand, had something hard, almost brutal, in his driving, that demanded the maximum from his car and from himself.” Was his go-for-broke driving emotional, or part of a predetermined strategy to force the Fangio-Moss Mercedes beyond its limits? This point would be debated for years afterward. Norman Dewis, co-driver of the third Jaguar, claimed that Hawthorn had been instructed to “push on as hard as hell with no thought of finishing.” Others who knew the fiery Englishman disagreed. Aston Martin driver Tony Brooks believed that Hawthorn let his emotions get the better of him when he made his fateful first pit entry at 6:29 p.m. “I think it was a rush of blood to the head,” he said.</p></div><div><div data-w-id="5087366b-7add-d47f-4f83-4d8012ab0c44" data-ix="new-interaction-2"><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767582fbc8a1908aa6141_E0MJM0.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 92vw, (max-width: 767px) 90vw, (max-width: 991px) 92vw, (max-width: 1439px) 44vw, (max-width: 1919px) 650px, 630px" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767582fbc8a1908aa6141_E0MJM0-p-500.jpg 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767582fbc8a1908aa6141_E0MJM0-p-800.jpg 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767582fbc8a1908aa6141_E0MJM0-p-1080.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767582fbc8a1908aa6141_E0MJM0-p-1600.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767582fbc8a1908aa6141_E0MJM0-p-2000.jpg 2000w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767582fbc8a1908aa6141_E0MJM0-p-2600.jpg 2600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767582fbc8a1908aa6141_E0MJM0-p-3200.jpg 3200w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767582fbc8a1908aa6141_E0MJM0.jpg 5304w" alt=""></p><div><p>The Hawthorn/Bueb Jaguar at the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans. </p><p>Keystone Press / Alamy</p></div></div><p>“I think it was a rush of blood to the head.”</p></div></div><div data-w-id="51951bcb-b476-6bbb-34e4-005c42b4c39f"><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767e72126094e17c90546_55LEMANS05.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 92vw, (max-width: 767px) 90vw, (max-width: 1439px) 92vw, 1320px" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767e72126094e17c90546_55LEMANS05-p-500.jpg 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767e72126094e17c90546_55LEMANS05-p-800.jpg 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767e72126094e17c90546_55LEMANS05-p-1080.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767e72126094e17c90546_55LEMANS05-p-1600.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673767e72126094e17c90546_55LEMANS05.jpg 2000w" alt=""></p><div><p>The aftermath of the worst tragedy in motorsport history. </p><p>LAT Photographic</p></div></div><div><p>Hawthorn got the signal to refuel and change drivers after completing his 32nd lap. On the upward slope leading to the pit straight, with the grandstand approaching, he lapped Levegh’s Mercedes for the first time and began to gain rapidly on a slower car that he had lapped three times already: Lance Macklin’s Austin-Healey.</p><p>Macklin, traveling at about 135 mph, had glimpsed a green Jaguar and a silver Mercedes in his rearview mirror and edged to the right to let the faster cars pass. Hawthorn overtook him, as expected, and then did something that Macklin later characterized as a misjudgment: he pulled back in front of the Austin-Healey — “rather violently,” Fangio claimed — and braked for his pit entry. Macklin slammed on his brakes. Realizing he was about to rear-end the Jaguar, he swerved left to avoid it.</p><p>Levegh’s Mercedes collided with the sloping rear of the Austin-Healey at 150 mph and launched into the air. Macklin remembered feeling the “searing heat” of its exhaust on his face as it sailed over him, and seeing Levegh hunched over the wheel as his Mercedes flew off the track. It landed on an earth embankment, crashed into a concrete stairwell, and exploded like a grenade, sending shards of hot metal hurtling into an open public enclosure next to the grandstand.&nbsp;</p><p>Survivors positioned on both sides of the track said that the impact sounded like a bomb going off. What they heard next was screaming chaos. The enormous impact had torn the engine mount and front axle from the SLR’s chassis and sent both of these large pieces scything through a shoulder-to-shoulder crowd. Fifty people were killed in an instant, many of them decapitated. In the words of one eyewitness, the approximately ten-by-forty-foot area in which they had been standing had become “a clear patch with lots of bits.”</p></div><div><div><p>It began raining at dawn, and the grounds had turned to mud by the time Hawthorn and Bueb claimed a hollow victory.</p></div><div><p>The burning chassis of Levegh’s Mercedes sat atop the embankment; his dead body lay beneath it. Marshals sprayed water on the flames, which only made the magnesium components burn stronger. It would be hours before the blaze went out.&nbsp;</p><p>The collision had sent Macklin’s Austin-Healey spinning backwards through the pits. It mowed down a gendarme, a photographer, and two race officials; all four were gravely injured. Miraculously, Macklin exited his vehicle unhurt.</p><p>Fangio, who’d been roaring up behind Levegh, had cut such a tight path through the careening vehicles that a streak of green paint from one of the British cars was later found on his Mercedes. He later said that Levegh, by raising his arm in warning right before the collision, had saved his life.</p><p>Hawthorn overshot the Jaguar pits and got out of his car looking distraught. Because the rules prohibited driving backwards, team manager Lofty England ordered him to do another lap before handing the car over to Bueb.</p></div></div><div><p>It took hours for the full scale of the disaster to become known. Life mostly went on as usual outside the area that now resembled a warzone, and jaunty accordion music continued to play over the PA system as panicked spectators fled and gendarmes and volunteers entered the carnage, using advertising boards as stretchers. Doctors attended to the dead and wounded; priests administered last rites in French and German.</p><p>The organizers kept the race going and made no public announcement, reasoning that the ensuing panic and mass exodus would impede emergency vehicles. Radio listeners and television viewers learned that dozens had been killed before most people at the race did. Neubauer approached Jaguar about doing a joint withdrawal and was rebuffed. After holding an emergency meeting in Stuttgart, the Daimler-Benz board of directors told him to pull the two other cars from the race at around midnight. By the time he finally did, at 1:45, they were running first and third. Having held the lead for several hours, Nebauer later explained, the team “could now afford to retire.” It had packed up and left the track by daybreak.</p><p>It began raining at dawn, and the grounds had turned to mud by the time the Hawthorn-Bueb Jaguar claimed a hollow victory. The death toll had risen into the eighties, with more than one hundred injured. Front-page newspaper photos of Hawthorn sipping from a bottle of champagne would come back to haunt him. He later wrote of the disaster: “It was as though we were at the point where a great rock had been hurled into a pond, sending out waves of shock and horror and indignation which would later flow back, bringing consequences which no one could foresee.”</p></div></div><div data-w-id="9abe1c07-0eb6-c1ed-fa35-21a9b4589062"><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673628921124ef4fb20119fb_E0MJ1A.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 92vw, (max-width: 991px) 90vw, 800px" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673628921124ef4fb20119fb_E0MJ1A-p-500.jpg 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673628921124ef4fb20119fb_E0MJ1A-p-800.jpg 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673628921124ef4fb20119fb_E0MJ1A-p-1080.jpg 1080w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673628921124ef4fb20119fb_E0MJ1A-p-1600.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673628921124ef4fb20119fb_E0MJ1A-p-2000.jpg 2000w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673628921124ef4fb20119fb_E0MJ1A-p-2600.jpg 2600w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673628921124ef4fb20119fb_E0MJ1A-p-3200.jpg 3200w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/673628921124ef4fb20119fb_E0MJ1A.jpg 5592w" alt=""></p><div><p>Mike Hawthorn and Ivor Bueb after winning the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans. </p><p>Keystone Press / Alamy</p></div></div><div><div><div><p>The rush to assign blame began immediately. Mercedes and Jaguar declared their innocence in press statements, but the early prevailing sentiment ran against the Germans and the supposedly incompetent Levegh. In his 1958 memoir, Hawthorn implicitly blamed Macklin, who in turn sued his ex-friend for libel. The proceedings ended a year later, when Hawthorn died in a road accident near his home in Surrey.&nbsp;</p><p>The scholarship of the intervening decades — including whole books on the 1955 Le Mans disaster by Mark Kahn and Chris Hilton — seems to agree that the driver who set the deadly chain of events in motion was Hawthorn. (Macklin, who died in 2002, claimed that Hawthorn admitted as much right after the accident and even apologized to him for it.) Years after the heat of the moment, the pointlessness of Hawthorn’s risky maneuver outside the pits stands out. Endurance races are decided by minutes, not seconds. By pulling ahead of Macklin instead of tucking in behind him, Hawthorn could not have hoped to gain more than a couple seconds on Fangio.</p></div><div><p>Years after the heat of the moment, the pointlessness of Hawthorn’s risky maneuver outside the pits stands out.</p></div></div><div><p>An official inquiry exonerated all drivers. The decision to continue the race, initially criticized as heartless, has come to be viewed as the right one. It almost certainly saved lives. The editors of <em>Motor Sport</em> argued in an editorial later that summer that it also probably preserved the existence of Le Mans. The racing press accused governments and the popular press of overreacting — “DEATH RACE,” blared the <em>Daily Mail</em> — but in hindsight, clearly something had to be done about the fact that a split-second misjudgment by an elite driver could create mass carnage. France banned all motor racing pending an investigation of the incident. Switzerland banned all motor racing, period, a restriction that endured until 2018. The 1955 Italian and Spanish Grand Prix were canceled. Races with a reputation for being dangerous came under special scrutiny: Nürburgring was called off that year, and the deadly Carrera Panamericana was discontinued.</p><p>The Automobile Club de l’Ouest, organizer of Le Mans, redesigned the track and spectator areas in light of the tragedy, moving the pits back nearly 50 feet and making other safety improvements. The 1956 race featured no fatal incidents – and drew even bigger crowds.</p></div></div><div data-w-id="c794cccd-ee1d-5dc0-e8d2-86a42d1f347a" data-ix="new-interaction-2"><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/67376759b1486dca3e32e927_1017515805-SCH-19690615-602_3A.png" loading="lazy" data-w-id="c794cccd-ee1d-5dc0-e8d2-86a42d1f347b" sizes="100vw" alt="Daniel Riccardo shot during the 2022 French Grand Prix, Circuit Paul Ricard.

In many ways, they were just beginning. The Le Mans disaster laid bare the grand illusion that motorsport had evolved beyond the bloodiness of its early years. The primitive scenes of violence from the grandstand area, which appeared in newsreels around the world, made it gruesomely clear that the sport’s safety standards had failed to keep up with the increasing speed and deadliness of its cars.</p><p>The moment marked the end of an age of innocence, which is probably one reason the scale of the 1955 Le Mans disaster has never been surpassed. Though it stands alone in this respect, the incident also served as just one example in a larger argument. Were horrific crashes like this one unavoidable? Or could more be done to prevent them without compromising the fundamental draw of the sport? The racing establishment of this era resisted self-reform, and only got serious about redefining safety standards following crashes in which innocent bystanders were killed and public outrage ensued. Le Mans was the most devastating of these disasters, but not the only one. Another was the 1957 crash during the Mille Miglia that killed two drivers and nine spectators, which led the Italian government to outlaw racing on public roads, and landed Enzo Ferrari on trial for manslaughter.&nbsp;</p><p>Change did not come swiftly. On the contrary, Formula 1’s deadliest season, in which separate accidents claimed the lives of four drivers in five months, occurred in 1958. Ferrari’s Wolfgang Von Trips and 15 spectators were killed at the 1961 Italian Grand Prix. It would take years before elite drivers stopped dying at alarming rates, and for the popular image of them as peacetime fighter pilots — fast, courageous, likely to be killed in action — to fade away. Even then, the argument that death had always been part of racing hindered efforts to protect drivers and contributed to a lingering expectation of self-sacrifice. World champions like Jackie Stewart could raise safety concerns, but they continued to be ignored until the death or near-death of a famous driver called attention to them. For example, Formula 1 drivers considered the Nürburgring so dangerous that they boycotted it for the 1970 Grand Prix, but it was not until Niki Lauda’s near-fatal crash there, six years later, that the track was comprehensively reimagined.</p></div><div><div><p>Safety considerations are paramount at the top levels of racing now. Since Ayrton Senna’s shocking death in 1994, only one Formula 1 driver, Jules Bianchi, has been killed while racing. Both tragedies forced the adoption of universal safety measures — including new standards for safety barriers, reductions in pit-lane speeds, the adoption of virtual safety cars, the halo, and more — far quicker and more comprehensively than the old disasters ever did.</p><p>Mercedes abandoned racing at the end of the 1955 season. It already had plans to do so, having proven itself as an all-conquering force in Formula 1, but the Le Mans disaster certainly made this a harder decision to reverse. Fangio went on to win that season’s Formula 1 title, his third and last for Mercedes. (He won again in 1956, with Ferrari, and in 1957, with Maserati.) In the short term, the Mercedes recusal helped Jaguar to dominate Le Mans and Ferrari to become more of a force in Formula 1. It was also part of a multi-decade identity shift for Mercedes, which would go on to pioneer anti-lock brakes, anti-collision radar systems, and other consumer safety technologies. It would be another 40 years before Mercedes got back into racing, and it did not win its next Formula 1 championship until 2014, with drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg.</p><p>Its cars were terrifyingly fast all over again. This time, though, they were far less deadly.<br></p></div><div data-w-id="33117215-f22a-c4cf-ee3b-c6dde1ec391a" data-ix="new-interaction-2"><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/6737675994522935e6b00b71_Lauda_print.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 92vw, (max-width: 767px) 90vw, (max-width: 991px) 92vw, (max-width: 1439px) 44vw, 650px" srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/6737675994522935e6b00b71_Lauda_print-p-500.png 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/6737675994522935e6b00b71_Lauda_print-p-800.png 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/6737675994522935e6b00b71_Lauda_print-p-1080.png 1080w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c285cc79c5b493a025f308/6737675994522935e6b00b71_Lauda_print.png 1500w" alt=""></p><div><p>Niki Lauda’s near-fatal crash at Nürburgring in 1976 led to a redesign of the track.</p><p>dpa picture alliance / Alamy</p></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Read the <a href="https://github.com/gsidhu/buzee-tauri/blob/main/VISION&amp;ROADMAP">Vision and Roadmap</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">I have spent two years building this project. It started as an Electron app, then I switched to Tauri for performance gains. When I started I barely new JavaScript and Svelte. Over the course of development, I learned NodeJS, TypeScript, SQLite, Rust, Tauri, Tantivy, and many other technologies. I learned so much about managing a project of this size and complexity. I am proud of what I have built but I am more proud of what I have learned.</p>
<p dir="auto">I am now letting go of this project because I have other priorities. Please feel free to do with this project as you wish. I am happy to help you get started with the codebase.</p>
<p dir="auto">If nothing else, this project can serve as an example of how to build a full-text search engine using Tauri and Tantivy. There are several tiny features and performance workarounds that I have implemented that you might find useful.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you do do something with this project, please let me know. I would love to see what you build!</p>
