<p dir="auto"><a href="https://adnauseam.io/" rel="nofollow">AdNauseam</a> is a lightweight browser extension that blends software tool and artware intervention to actively fight back against tracking by advertising networks. AdNauseam works like an ad-blocker (it is built atop <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock Origin</a>) to silently simulate clicks on each blocked ad, confusing trackers as to one's real interests. At the same time, AdNauseam serves as a means of voicing your discontent with advertising networks that disregard privacy and engage in bulk surveillance.</p>
<p dir="auto">In light of the industry's failure to address the excesses of network tracking, AdNauseam allows individual users to take matters into their own hands, offering active defense against surveillance, profiling and potential discrimination. The software thus represents a similar approach to that of <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/trackmenot" rel="nofollow">TrackMeNot</a>, relocating power in the hands of individual users, rather than vast commercial entities. For further information on this approach, please see <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/trackmenot/resources/trackmenot2009.pdf" rel="nofollow">this paper</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>A team led by Siegfried Wagner and Pearse Keane of Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology (and spanning UCL institutions) has identified markers that indicate the presence of Parkinson’s disease in patients on average seven years before clinical presentation. This is the first time anyone has shown these findings several years before diagnosis, and these results were made possible by the largest study to date on retinal imaging in Parkinson’s disease.</p>
<p>The study, published today in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, identified markers of Parkinson’s in eye scans with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). Its analysis of the AlzEye dataset was repeated using the wider UK Biobank database (healthy volunteers), which replicated the discoveries. The use of these two large, powerful datasets has enabled the team to identify these subtle markers, even though Parkinson’s disease has a relatively low prevalence (0.1-0.2% of the population). Generation of the AlzEye dataset was enabled by INSIGHT, the world's largest database of retinal images and associated clinical data.</p>
<p>The use of data from eye scans has previously revealed signs of other neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis and, most recently, schizophrenia, in an emerging and exciting field of research referred to as “oculomics”.</p>
<p>Doctors have known for a long time that the eye can act as a ‘window’ to the rest of the body, giving a direct insight into many aspects of our health. High-resolution images of the retina are now a routine part of eye care – in particular, a type of 3D scan known as ‘optical coherence tomography’ (OCT), which is widely used in eye clinics and high-street opticians. In less than a minute, an OCT scan produces a cross-section of the retina (the back of the eye) in incredible detail – down to a thousandth of a millimetre.</p>
<p>These images are extremely useful for monitoring eye health, but their value goes much further, as a scan of the retina is the only non-intrusive way to view layers of cells below the skin’s surface. In recent years, researchers have started to use powerful computers to accurately analyse large numbers of OCTs and other eye images, in a fraction of the time it would take a human. Using a type of AI known as ‘machine learning’, computers are now able to uncover hidden information about the whole body from these images alone. Harnessing this new potential is what oculomics is about. <br>This work has involved collaboration between the NIHR (National Institute of Health and Social Care) Biomedical Research Centres at Moorfields Eye Hospital, University Hospital Birmingham, Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), Oxford University Hospital, University College Hospital London and the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health. The scope and quality of the research has been maximised through these exceptional NHS research partnerships.</p>
<p>Alastair Denniston, consultant ophthalmologist at University Hospitals Birmingham, professor at the University of Birmingham and part of NIHR Moorfields BRC said: “This work demonstrates the potential for eye data, harnessed by the technology to pick up signs and changes too subtle for humans to see. We can now detect very early signs of Parkinson’s, opening up new possibilities for treatment.”</p>
<p>Siegfried Wagner, clinical research fellow at Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology researcher and principal investigator for this and several other AlzEye studies, added: “I continue to be amazed by what we can discover through eye scans. While we are not yet ready to predict whether an individual will develop Parkinson’s, we hope that this method could soon become a pre-screening tool for people at risk of disease. Finding signs of a number of diseases before symptoms emerge means that, in the future, people could have the time to make lifestyle changes to prevent some conditions arising, and clinicians could delay the onset and impact of lifechanging neurodegenerative disorders.”</p>
<p>Louisa Wickham, Moorfields’ medical director, explained that “Increasing imaging across a wider population will have a huge impact on public health in the future, and will eventually lead to predictive analysis. OCT scans are more scalable, non-invasive, lower cost and quicker than brain scans for this purpose.”</p>

<p>The fight over water is nothing new on Maui. But the impact on the county’s ability to battle fires is coming clear. </p>



<p>With wildfires ravaging West Maui on Aug. 8, a state water official delayed the release of water that landowners wanted to help protect their property from fires. The water standoff played out over much of the day and the water didn’t come until too late.</p>



<p>The dispute involved the Department of Land and Natural Resources’ water resource management division and&nbsp;<a href="https://westmauiwater.com/">West Maui Land Co.</a>, which manages agricultural and residential subdivisions in West Maui as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://westmauiwater.com/lic">Launiupoko Irrigation Co.</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://westmauiwater.com/lwc-account">Launiupoko Water Co.</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://westmauiwater.com/owc-account">Olowalu Water Co.</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://westmauiwater.com/htwa-account">Ha’iku Town Water Association.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>DLNR delayed releasing water requested by West Maui Land Co. to help prevent the spread of fire, sources familiar with the situation said.</p>

<p>Specifically, according to accounts of four people with knowledge of the situation, <a href="https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/cwrm/aboutus/deputy/">M. Kaleo Manuel</a>, a Native Hawaiian cultural practitioner and DLNR’s deputy director for water resource management, initially balked at West Maui Land Co.’s requests for additional water to help prevent the fire from spreading to properties managed by the company.</p>



<div><header><h4>A Note On Anonymous Sources</h4></header><p>Civil Beat generally uses on-the-record sources. However, we occasionally use unnamed sources when a source is sharing important information we wouldn’t have otherwise been able to obtain and when they could face negative consequences for speaking publicly. The reporter and at least one editor must know the identity of the source and the use of anonymity must be approved by a senior editor.

<p>According to the sources, Manuel wanted West Maui Land to get permission from a taro, or kalo, farm located downstream from the company’s property. Manuel eventually released water but not until after the fire had spread. It was not clear on Monday how much damage the fire did in the interim or whether homes were damaged.</p>



<p>Manuel declined to be interviewed for this story. DLNR’s communications office said in an email that it was supporting the state’s emergency communications response and “unable to facilitate your inquiry at this time.” </p>



<p>Glenn Tremble, an executive with West Maui Land Co. said to have knowledge of the dispute, did not return a request for comment.</p>



<p>However, Gov. Josh Green spoke candidly Monday during a press briefing about conflicts over water on Maui – although not the DLNR-West Maui Land Co. incident directly – and encouraged news media to explore the issue. The conflicts are rooted in the diversion of water by large plantations, which starved downstream users from a resource essential for Native Hawaiian agriculture, particularly the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/03/a-struggle-over-water-lawmakers-push-to-protect-kalo-cultivation/">traditional practice of growing taro or kalo</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the governor said conflicts over water are being reshaped in an age of climate change and wildfires. Now the conflict includes opponents who do not want water to be used to fight fires, the governor said.</p>

<p>“One thing that people need to understand especially those from far away is that there’s been a great deal of water conflict on Maui for many years,” Green said. “It’s important that we’re honest about this. People have been fighting against the release of water to fight fires. I’ll leave that to you to explore.”</p>



<p>“We have a difficult time on Maui and other rural areas getting enough water for houses, for our people, for any response,” Green added. “But it’s important we start being honest. There are currently people still fighting in our state giving us water access to fight and prepare for fires even as more storms arise.”</p>



<p>Green said the state is in the midst of a “comprehensive review” by Attorney General Anne Lopez of decisions made before and during the firefighting efforts.</p>



<p>“There will be multiple reviews at every level,” he said.</p>



<p>In 2022, two Maui senators, <a href="https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/legislature/memberpage.aspx?member=186&amp;year=2023">Gil Keith-Agaran</a> and <a href="https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/legislature/memberpage.aspx?member=161&amp;year=2023">Lynne DeCoite</a>, introduced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session/archives/measure_indiv_Archives.aspx?billtype=SB&amp;billnumber=2355&amp;year=2022">a measure</a>&nbsp;to push DLNR to allow fresh water to be used to fight fires and pointed to West Maui as being particularly vulnerable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bill noted that “in 2019, West Maui suffered from an active fire season in which wildfires scorched twenty-five thousand acres of land.” It would have required DLNR to “cooperate with the counties and reservoir owners to develop protocols and agreements for the use of reservoir waters for fire safety purposes.”</p>



<p>Specifically, the measure said, “The protocols and agreements shall address the emergency use of reservoir waters for prevention, control, and extinguishment of fires while taking into account the various competing uses of reservoir waters.”</p>



<p>The bill died without a hearing.</p>

<p><img alt="LIBREOFFICE" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/libreoffice.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
One nugget of information in the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/LibreOffice-7.6">LibreOffice 7.6</a> release announcement for those who missed it and deserves calling out specifically... Succeeding LibreOffice 7.6 will not be v7.7 or v8.0 but rather v24.2.
</p><p>
LibreOffice developers are moving to a year.month based versioning system. Thus the next release with their six-month based release cadence will be LibreOffice 24.2 and in turn LibreOffice 24.8, 25.2, 25.8, 26.2, etc. Due to the maturity of the LibreOffice codebase, the current versioning system isn't really reflective of major changes and in turn can be hard to genuinely justify bumping the significant version number. By switching to a calendar-based numbering system it's now decoupled from features or not of that release.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2023&amp;image=libreoffice_242" alt="LibreOffice 24.2 dev builds"></p>
<p>There were some internal discussions whether it should move to say LibreOffice 2024.2 but in the end they decided for a YY.M-based scheme. There were also discussions whether to just always increase the major version number with each new release as Firefox and Google Chrome do now, but that too was <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/libreoffice/2023-June/090430.html">decided</a> against.
</p><p>
So next February, look forward to LibreOffice 24.2.</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <ol>

            <li>
                UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM
                <ul>

                    <li>
                        <b> First.</b> You have to <em> understand</em>
                        the problem.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        What is the unknown?  What are the data?  What
                        is the condition?
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Is it possible to satisfy the condition?  Is the
                        condition sufficient to determine the unknown?
                        Or is it insufficient?  Or redundant?  Or
                        contradictory?
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Draw a figure.  Introduce suitable notation.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Separate the various parts of the condition. Can
                        you write them down?

                    </li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
                DEVISING A PLAN
                <ul>

                    <li>
                        <b> Second.</b> Find the connection between the
                        data and the unknown.  You may be obliged to
                        consider auxiliary problems if an immediate
                        connection cannot be found.  You should obtain
                        eventually a <em> plan</em> of the solution.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Have you seen it before?  Or have you seen the
                        same problem in a slightly different form?
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <em> Do you know a related problem?</em> Do you
                        know a theorem that could be useful?
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <em> Look at the unknown!</em> And try to think
                        of a familiar problem having the same or a
                        similar unknown.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <em> Here is a problem related to yours and
                        solved before.  Could you use it?</em> Could you
                        use its result?  Could you use its method?
                        Should you introduce some auxiliary element in
                        order to make its use possible?
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Could you restate the problem?  Could you
                        restate it still differently?  Go back to
                        definitions.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        If you cannot solve the proposed problem try to
                        solve first some related problem.  Could you
                        imagine a more accessible related problem?  A
                        more general problem?  A more special problem?
                        An analogous problem?  Could you solve a part of
                        the problem?  Keep only a part of the condition,
                        drop the other part; how far is the unknown then
                        determined, how can it vary?  Could you derive
                        something useful from the data?  Could you think
                        of other data appropriate to determine the
                        unknown?  Could you change the unknown or data,
                        or both if necessary, so that the new unknown

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Credit reporting agency Experian must pay a $650,000 fine for violating spam laws. The US Justice Department and the FTC have <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/permanent-injunction-and-650000-civil-penalty-imposed-experian-consumer-services-allegedly">announced a permanent injunction</a> granted by the US District Court in central California, forbidding the company’s deceptive marketing email practices. The regulators’ <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/1ECSComplaint.pdf">complaint last week</a> alleged that Experian had sent customers with free credit monitoring memberships deceptive marketing emails that lacked both “clear and conspicuous notice” of the ability to opt out and “a mechanism for doing so.” </p><p>The FTC says this violates the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/can-spam">CAN-SPAM Act</a>). The FTC referred the case to the DOJ to file the injunction before the court granted it, ordering Experian to pay the almost three-quarter-million-dollar fine within seven days.</p><p>If you’ve been unlucky enough to receive Experian spam, you may already know the format. A new car has been noticed on your account — please confirm it! You need dark web monitoring to protect you! And, of course, that old classic: boost your FICO score. And of course, when you log in to your account, you’re treated to a page that wants you to upgrade your account or sign up for a loan, though that doesn’t appear to fall under the purview of this case.</p><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/376x196/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/384x200/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/415x216/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/480x250/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/540x281/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/640x334/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/750x391/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/828x432/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/1080x563/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/1200x625/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/1440x751/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/1920x1001/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/2048x1067/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/2400x1251/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:944x492/2400x1251/filters:focal(472x246:473x247):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24866382/Screenshot_2023_08_22_at_12.46.05_PM.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p>Text at the bottom of emails <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/1-ECSComplaintExhibits.pdf">shown in court docs</a> reads, “This is not a marketing email,” and claims the messages were notifications of recent account changes.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><!--[--><!--[--><div><p>Fine-tuning for GPT-3.5 Turbo is now available, with fine-tuning for GPT-4 coming this fall. This update gives developers the ability to customize models that perform better for their use cases and run these custom models at scale. Early tests have shown a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 Turbo can match, or even outperform, base GPT-4-level capabilities on certain narrow tasks. As with all our APIs, data sent in and out of the fine-tuning API is owned by the customer and is <a href="https://openai.com/api-data-privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not used by OpenAI</a>, or any other organization, to train other models.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="fine-tuning-use-cases" data-heading=""><p><h2>Fine-tuning use cases</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>Since the release of GPT-3.5 Turbo, developers and businesses have asked for the ability to customize the model to create unique and differentiated experiences for their users. With this launch, developers can now run supervised fine-tuning to make this model perform better for their use cases.</p><p>In our private beta, fine-tuning customers have been able to meaningfully improve model performance across common use cases, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Improved steerability</strong>: Fine-tuning allows businesses to make the model follow instructions better, such as making outputs terse or always responding in a given language. For instance, developers can use fine-tuning to ensure that the model always responds in German when prompted to use that language.</li><li><strong>Reliable output formatting:</strong> Fine-tuning improves the model's ability to consistently format responses—a crucial aspect for applications demanding a specific response format, such as code completion or composing API calls. A developer can use fine-tuning to more reliably convert user prompts into high-quality JSON snippets that can be used with their own systems.</li><li><strong>Custom tone:</strong> Fine-tuning is a great way to hone the qualitative feel of the model output, such as its tone, so it better fits the voice of businesses’ brands. A business with a recognizable brand voice can use fine-tuning for the model to be more consistent with their tone.</li></ul><p>In addition to increased performance, fine-tuning also enables businesses to <strong>shorten their prompts </strong>while ensuring similar performance.&nbsp; Fine-tuning with GPT-3.5-Turbo can also handle 4k tokens—double our previous fine-tuned models. Early testers have reduced prompt size by up to 90% by fine-tuning instructions into the model itself, speeding up each API call and cutting costs.</p><p>Fine-tuning is most powerful when combined with <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt-best-practices" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other techniques</a> such as prompt engineering, information retrieval, and function calling. Check out our <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fine-tuning guide</a> to learn more. Support for fine-tuning with function calling and <code>gpt-3.5-turbo-16k</code> will be coming later this fall. <br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><section><figure><p><h2>Fine-tuning steps</h2></p><div><!--[--><div><div><p><span>Step 3</span></p><p><span>Create a fine-tuning job</span></p></div><div><p>Once a model finishes the fine-tuning process, it is available to be used in production right away and has the same shared <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/what-are-the-rate-limits-for-our-api" target="_blank">rate limits</a> as the underlying model.</p></div></div><div><p><span>Step 4</span></p><p><span>Use a fine-tuned model</span></p></div><!--]--></div><p><figcaption> We will also be debuting a fine-tuning UI in the near future, which will give developers easier access to information about ongoing fine-tuning jobs, completed model snapshots, and more. </figcaption></p></figure></section><!--]--><!--[--><div id="safety" data-heading=""><p><h2>Safety</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>It is very important to us that the deployment of fine-tuning is safe. To preserve the default model's safety features through the&nbsp; fine-tuning process, fine-tuning training data is passed through our Moderation API and a GPT-4 powered moderation system to detect unsafe training data that conflict with our safety standards. <br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="pricing" data-heading=""><p><h2>Pricing</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>Fine-tuning costs are broken down into two buckets: the initial training cost and usage cost:</p><ul><li>Training: $0.008 / 1K Tokens</li><li>Usage input: $0.012 / 1K Tokens</li><li>Usage output: $0.016 / 1K Tokens</li></ul><p>For example, a <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> fine-tuning job with a training file of 100,000 tokens that is trained for 3 epochs would have an expected cost of $2.40.<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div id="updated-gpt-3-models" data-heading=""><p><h2>Updated GPT-3 models</h2></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>In July, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/gpt-4-api-general-availability" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">we announced</a> that the original GPT-3 base models (<code>ada</code>, <code>babbage</code>, <code>curie</code>, and <code>davinci</code>) would be turned off on January 4th, 2024. Today, we are making <code>babbage-002</code> and <code>davinci-002</code> available as replacements for these models, either as base or fine-tuned models. Customers can access those models by querying the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Completions API</a>.</p><p>These models can be fine-tuned with our new API endpoint <code>/v1/fine_tuning/jobs</code>. This new endpoint offers pagination and more extensibility to support the future evolution of the fine-tuning API. Transitioning from <code>/v1/fine-tunes</code> to the updated endpoint is straightforward and more details can be found in our new <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fine-tuning guide</a>. This deprecates the old&nbsp;<code>/v1/fine-tunes</code> endpoint, which will be turned off on January 4th, 2024.</p><p>Pricing for base and fine-tuned GPT-3 models is as follows:<br></p></div><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--><!--]--></div></div>]]></description>

While trio and curio are showing us what the future could look like</em></p><p><em>But chances are, you should use none of them.</em></p><p><span>As Rob Pike&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV9rvDllKEg&amp;ab_channel=gnbitcoms" rel="">said</a><span>, concurrency "</span><em>is about dealing with a lot of things as once</em><span>", unlike parallelism, which is "</span><em>doing lots of things at once</em><span>".</span></p><p>The typical analogy is this:</p><ul><li><p><span>concurrency is having two lines of customers ordering from a&nbsp;</span><strong>one</strong><span>&nbsp;cashier;</span></p></li><li><p><span>parallelism is having two lines of customers ordering from&nbsp;</span><strong>two</strong><span>&nbsp;cashiers.</span></p></li></ul><p>Which, means, if you think about it, that concurrency has a lot to do with sharing one resource.</p><p>The question is, which resource?</p><p>In a computer, you may have to share different things:</p><ul><li><p>Battery charge.</p></li><li><p>CPU calculation power.</p></li><li><p>RAM space.</p></li><li><p>Disk space and throughput.</p></li><li><p>Network throughput.</p></li><li><p>File system handles.</p></li><li><p>User input.</p></li><li><p>Screen real estate.</p></li><li><p>...</p></li></ul><p>There are tons of software that is written solely to deal with the fact we have to share.</p><p>asyncio, twisted, tornado and gevent are such tools, specialized to let you share more efficiently a CPU core between several things that access the network.</p><p>Now, it seems a bit counterintuitive to tie "CPU core" and "network" performances together.</p><p>But when you talk to the network, you send messages to the outside world, and then things gets out of your control. The outside world can answer each message very quickly, or not. You can't affect it that much.</p><p>Meanwhile, your program sits there, waiting for the answer to the message. And while it sits, what does it do in Python by default? It keeps the CPU core for itself.</p><p>Sure, this waiting and seating is often only a few milliseconds, so to a human it seems very quick at first glance. But one millisecond is a huge time for a computer that does billions of things in the blink of an eye.</p><p>asyncio, twisted, tornado and gevent have one trick up their sleeve: they can send a message to the network, and while waiting for the response, wake up another part of the program to do some other work. And they can do that with many messages in a row. While waiting for the network, they can let other parts of the program use the CPU core.</p><p>Note that they only can speed up waiting on the network. They will not make two calculations at the same time (can't use several CPU cores like with multiprocessing) and you can't speed up waiting on other types of I/O (like when you use threads to not block on user input or disk writes).</p><p>All in all, they are good for writing things like bots (web crawler, chat bots, network sniffers, etc.) and servers (web servers, proxies, ...). For maximum benefits, it's possible to use them inside other concurrency tools, such as multiprocessing or multithreading. You can perfectly have 4 processes, each of them containing 4 threads (so 16 threads in total), and each thread with their own asyncio loop running.</p><p>But let's not get side tracked, and focus on the question at hand: what are asyncio, tornado or twisted?</p><p>Let's take a few URLs from a completely random web site. Our task will be to get all the titles of all those pages.</p><p>Here is how to do that synchronously, with only the stdlib:</p><pre><code><code>import re

In other words, it's the default stuff at your disposal if you want to code something without waiting on the network.</span></p><p><span>asyncio replaces the old deprecated&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncore.html" rel="">asyncore</a><span>&nbsp;module. It is quite low level, so while you can manually code most network-related things with it, you are still at the level of TCP or UDP. If you want higher-level protocols, like FTP, HTTP or SSH, you have to either code it yourself, or install a third party library.</span></p><p><span>Because asyncio is the default solution, it has a the biggest ecosystem of 3rd party libs, and pretty much everything async strives to be compatible with it directly, or through compatibility layers like&nbsp;</span><a href="https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/3.x/" rel="">anyio</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>20 years ago, there was no asyncio, there was no&nbsp;</span><code>async</code><span>/</span><code>await</code><span>, nodejs didn't exist and Python 3 was half a decade away. Yet, it was the .com bubble, everything needed to be connected now. And so was born&nbsp;</span><a href="https://pypi.org/project/Twisted/" rel="">twisted</a><span>, the grandfather of all the asynchronous frameworks we have today. Twisted ecosystem grew to include everything, from mail to ssh.</span></p><p>To this day, twisted is still a robust and versatile tool. But you do pay the price of its age. It doesn't follow PEP8 very well, and the design lean on the heavy size.</p><p>Here is a typical asyncio http request:</p><pre><code><code>import httpx

You'll see.</span></p></li><li><p>ChatGPT will not help you much. Most twisted code is old, and use the old APIs and code style.

However, unless you know the ecosystem, good luck finding out the existence of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://github.com/twisted/treq" rel="">treq</a><span>, the high-level HTTP defacto lib.

It came about in 2009, the same year as Tornado, but with a fundamentally different design. Instead of attempting to provide an asychronous API, it decided to do black magic. When you use gevent, you call&nbsp;</span><code>from gevent import monkey; monkey.patch_all()</code><span>&nbsp;and it changes the underlying mechanism of Python networking, making everything non-blocking.</span></p><p>I used to fear gevent at the time:</p><ul><li><p>You had to compile it from source, or use eggs, and that had too many ways to fail.</p></li><li><p>Monkey patching is brittle by nature, so you rolled the dice every time you used it.</p></li><li><p><span>Task switching is implicit, and you never knew what dragon would&nbsp;</span><code>await</code><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p>So I avoided it like the plague.</p><p>Ironically, today, gevent is becoming quite appealing.</p><p><span>Thanks to </span><a href="https://realpython.com/python-wheels/" rel="">wheels</a><span>, installing it is simple and robust.

The article is quite complex, but the core idea is simple: spawning a coroutine (or goroutine, or green thread) is like calling&nbsp;</span><code>goto</code><span>. For the youngsters among the readers, it's a reference to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful" rel="">a famous Edsger Dijkstra's letter</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In short, it states that every time you start an async task, just like with&nbsp;</span><code>goto</code><span>, you jump somewhere else, in some other part of the code. Which means it's very hard to know where a coroutine comes from, when it started, and where it's going, or when it's going to stop. Scope and life spans are suddenly opaque, which makes reasoning about the whole software difficult.</span></p><p>And according to him, this is a problem with the design of our asyncio API, not with the nature of async itself.</p><p>Nathaniel didn't just come with a problem, it also brought a solution: a new kind of design for async handling, inspired by Beazley's concepts, with a few twists.</p><p><span>This solution grew into a library,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://github.com/python-trio/trio" rel="">trio</a><span>.</span></p><p>Trio is not compatible with asyncio, nor gevent or twisted by default. This means it's also its little own async island.</p><p>But in exchange for that, it provides a very different internal take on how to deal with this kind of concurrency, where every coroutine is tied to an explicit scope, everything can be awaited easily, or canceled.</p><p>The code isn't that different from your typical asyncio script:</p><pre><code><code>import re

Total time taken for all URLs: 0.2133 seconds</code></code></pre><p><span>Also, because it doesn't create nor schedule coroutines immediately (notice the&nbsp;</span><code>nursery.start_soon(fetch_url, url)</code><span>&nbsp;is not&nbsp;</span><code>nursery.start_soon(fetch_url(url))</code><span>), it will also consume less memory. But the most important part is the nursery:</span></p><pre><code><code>    # That's the biggest API difference
    async with trio.open_nursery() as nursery:
        for url in urls:
            nursery.start_soon(fetch_url, url)</code></code></pre><p><span>The&nbsp;</span><code>with</code><span>&nbsp;block scopes all the tasks, meaning everything that is started inside that context manager is guaranteed to be finished (or terminated) when it exits. First, the API is better than expecting the user to wait manually like with&nbsp;</span><code>asyncio.gather</code><span>: you cannot start concurrent coroutines without a clear scope in trio, it doesn't rely on the coder's discipline. But under the hood, the design is also different. The whole bunch of coroutines you group and start can be canceled easily, because trio always knows where things begin and end. As soon as things get complicated,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/some-thoughts-on-asynchronous-api-design-in-a-post-asyncawait-world/#example-1-asyncio-with-callbacks" rel="">code with curio-like design become radically simpler than ones with asyncio-like design</a><span>.</span></p><p>Would I recommend using trio in prod for now? No.</p><p>The asyncio ecosystem and compat advantage is too good to pass on.</p><p><span>But it is inspiring changes in asyncio design itself in very positive ways. E.G, in 3.11, we got&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.TaskGroup" rel="">asyncio.TaskGroup</a><span>, a similar concept to nurseries, and we had&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-groups" rel="">exception groups</a><span>&nbsp;added to Python. This can't change the underlying asyncio design, but the API is way nicer.</span></p><p>Fast API is not in the same category as the other libs. It's not supposed to be part of this article, because it's a completely different beast, but people asked questions about it and seemed confused, so I decided to add a little section to clarify.</p><p><span>Fast API is a high-level web framework like&nbsp;</span><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/" rel="">flask</a><span>, but that happens to be async, unlike flask. With the added benefit of using type hints and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/" rel="">pydantic</a><span>&nbsp;to generate schemas.</span></p><p>It's not a building block like twisted, gevent, trio or asyncio. In fact, it's built on top of asyncio. It's in the same group as flask, bottle, django, pyramid, etc. Although it's a micro-framework, so it's focused on routing, data validation and API delivery.</p><p>I use Fast API when I want to make a quick little web API. It basically replaced flask for everything I used it for, unless my clients or co-workers as for it, of course.</p><p><span>But don't get me wrong, Django is my web framework of choice, as I very rarely need a full web async framework, and with&nbsp;</span><a href="https://django-ninja.rest-framework.com/" rel="">django-ninja</a><span>, it's very easy to build a Web API almost like Fast API.</span></p><p><span>Also, and this will be the topic of another controversial article, I strongly believe beginners should start their first serious project with django and&nbsp;</span><strong>not</strong><span>&nbsp;flask, despite the fact most people see it the other way around. Flask is fine for learning, or for serious projects if you know what you are doing. In the middle lie troubles.</span></p><p>So which async lib to use?</p><p>Well, probably none of them.</p><p>Those tools serve a very niche purpose, and most people don't encounter it very often.</p><p>In fact, I would dare to say that  the vast majority of developers are not working on problems where network performance is an issue that hasn't be solved in a better way. At least at their scale.</p><p>If you are doing a web site, blocking frameworks like Django or Flask are fine, and you'll need a task queue no matter your stack. Small to medium companies rarely build services that would need more than that. Even a lot of big companies probably don’t need more.  </p><p>If you are doing calculations, this is CPU related, and they will not help you.</p><p><span>If you need to get a few URLS fast, a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html" rel="">ThreadPoolExecutor</a><span>&nbsp;is likely the Pareto solution, 99% of the time.</span></p><p><span>If you need an industrial crawler,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://scrapy.org/" rel="">scrappy</a><span>&nbsp;is there for you.</span></p><p>You have to understand that async programming is hard, and no matter how good the tooling is, it's going to make your code more difficult to manage. It has a high price.</p><p>Ok, but let's say you are sure you need some async lib, then which one?</p><p>If you are asking this question, then just go with asyncio. It's standard, so you'll get more doc, more 3rd party components, more resources in general.</p><p>I’ll add you probably should not go with asyncio manually. Use a higher level asyncio based lib, or better, framework. Async is hard enough as it is.</p><p>Some of you may think: “but wait, for this particular task, I do need async, and I did my research, and asyncio is not the proper tool”.</p><p>But then, you don’t need the help of this article to decide, you already have the skills to make an educated choice.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ever since we launched <a href="https://figma.com/blog/introducing-dev-mode/">Dev Mode at Config</a>, we’ve been focused on improving it to better meet your needs. We’ve seen the blog articles, webinars, social posts, and more than 5,000 messages where you shared your input, and we’ve <a href="https://figma.com/blog/anatomy-of-an-open-beta/">considered every single piece of feedback</a>. From upgrading existing features, to expanding functionality, to creating help articles, we’re excited to share that we’ve shipped 200+ updates. Here are 35 you should definitely know&nbsp;about.</p></div><div><h2 id="new-to-dev-mode"><a href="#new-to-dev-mode">New to Dev Mode</a></h2><p>1. <strong>You can now add status labels to components, instances, and frames</strong> in addition to sections on the canvas—making it even easier to share assets for development without having to totally reorganize your&nbsp;file.</p><div><figure><figcaption>Add status labels to components, instances, frames, and sections on the canvas to signal when they’re ready for development.</figcaption></figure></div><p>2. You asked, we delivered: <strong>Access layout grids, rules, and outline mode </strong>via the “View” menu, or using the same shortcuts as in&nbsp;Design&nbsp;Mode.</p><div><figure><figcaption>Use layout grids, rules, and outline mode for all your spacing needs.</figcaption></figure></div><p>3. Want to learn more about detached components? Voilà—<strong>you can compare changes to the main&nbsp;component.</strong></p><div><figure><figcaption>See when a component has been detached and compare it with the main component.</figcaption></figure></div><p>4. By popular demand, <strong>we brought back Android XML &amp; iOS UIKit as&nbsp;code&nbsp;options</strong>.</p><p>5. Expand your palette with <strong>the new UIColor option</strong>. Select it using the color format dropdown in the Inspect&nbsp;panel.</p><p>6. Drum roll, please: <strong>With version history, you can view and inspect different iterations</strong> of your design by clicking the file name in&nbsp;the&nbsp;toolbar.</p><h2 id="usability-and-performance-improvements"><a href="#usability-and-performance-improvements">Usability and performance improvements </a></h2><p>7. When a design system component hails from an external library, <strong>we’ll surface the name of&nbsp;that&nbsp;library</strong>.</p><p>8. <strong>Nested component props show up in the component playground</strong>, giving you higher detail and more to experiment with.</p><div><figure><figcaption>See which library a component came from and experiment with modes in the component playground.</figcaption></figure></div><p>9. If you have different modes set for a component configuration—say, light and dark modes—<strong>you can experiment with them in the component playground</strong>, too.</p><p>10. When choosing which units you want to see in the canvas and generated code, <strong>you can select the rem unit only with text properties</strong>, and keep the other properties in&nbsp;pixels.</p><div><figure><figcaption>See rem units with text, but keep other properties in pixels.</figcaption></figure></div><p>11. <strong>You can select—and even export—multiple objects at once</strong> from the canvas. Just hold “Shift” and click to round&nbsp;’em&nbsp;up.</p><p>12. <strong>All files and notifications from your Figma account <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/15023121296151-Figma-for-VS-Code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">will surface in VS Code</a></strong>, making it easier for you to switch projects and stay on top&nbsp;of&nbsp;changes.</p><p>13. Typography preview goes beyond visualization, <strong>revealing rich text properties like style name, font size, and line height</strong>—all of which you can copy with&nbsp;a&nbsp;click.</p><p>14. Let’s get granular. <strong>You can select individual parts of the text on the canvas to&nbsp;inspect</strong>.</p><p>15. <strong>The layers section in the left panel is vertically resizable</strong>—just click and drag to change the height to your heart’s&nbsp;desire.</p><p>16. When there’s a raw value with a high probability match with a variable in your design system, <strong>we’ll suggest the variable</strong> so designers don’t have to add them in&nbsp;manually.</p><p>17. You can inspect values not only through code snippets, but <strong>also as Figma properties</strong>.</p><p>18. The new source files section <strong>allows you to download files</strong>, such as images, that are part of&nbsp;the&nbsp;design.</p><p>19. We added the<strong> alternative units feature </strong>to the regular preference menu to make it easier&nbsp;to&nbsp;find.</p><p>20. When a section is selected, you’ll get <strong>a collated view for links by frame</strong> at the section level.</p><h2 id="updates-to-code-generation"><a href="#updates-to-code-generation">Updates to code generation</a></h2><p>21. New shortcut alert: <strong>Hold down “Shift” to copy all code snippets</strong> at once.</p><p>22. You can use <code>padding-top</code>, <code>-bottom</code>, <code>-left</code>, and <code>-right</code> in CSS even if only one padding value&nbsp;is&nbsp;set.</p><p>23. No more squinting to see if that’s Arial or Helvetica. We always show <code>font-style</code>, <code>line-height</code>, and <code>font-weight</code> in code snippets. </p><p>24. Code snippets show <code>line-height</code> as both a % value and pixel value, so you always have the information you&nbsp;need.</p><p>25. OpenType font features <code>font-feature-settings</code>, <code>font-variant-numeric</code>, and <code>font-kerning</code> are supported in&nbsp;CSS&nbsp;codegen.</p><p>26. We’ve added variable support for auto layout properties <code>min-width</code>, <code>max-width</code>, <code>min-height</code>, and <code>max-height</code> as well as vertical gap in wrapping layouts.</p><p>27. For text layers that have multiple paragraphs or spans that include different text styles, <strong>we display the CSS code for each individual style.</strong></p><p>28. We can’t take credit for this one, but <strong>there are nearly 80 codegen plugins available</strong> in the Figma community. <a href="https://figma.com/community/plugins/devmode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Check out some of our favorites</a> for Tailwind, React, Vue,&nbsp;and&nbsp;more.</p><h2 id="bug-fixes"><a href="#bug-fixes">Bug fixes</a></h2><p>29. <strong>Switch between Design and Dev Mode</strong> using tab navigation. </p><p>30.

    <h2><a href="https://go.dev/blog/">The Go Blog</a></h2>
    

    
      
      
      
      <p>The new <code>log/slog</code> package in Go 1.21 brings structured logging to the standard
library. Structured logs use key-value pairs so they can be parsed, filtered,
searched, and analyzed quickly and reliably.
For servers, logging is an important way for developers to
observe the detailed behavior of the system, and often the first place they go
to debug it. Logs therefore tend to be voluminous, and the ability to search and
filter them quickly is essential.</p>
<p>The standard library has had a logging package, <code>log</code>,
since Go’s initial release over a decade ago.
Over time,
we’ve learned that structured logging is important to Go programmers. It has
consistently ranked high in our annual survey, and many packages in the Go
ecosystem provide it. Some of these are quite popular: one of the first structured
logging packages for Go, <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sirupsen/logrus" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">logrus</a>,
is used in over 100,000 other packages.</p>
<p>With many structured logging packages to choose from, large programs
will often end up including more than one through their dependencies. The main program
might have to configure each of these logging packages so that the log output is
consistent: it all goes to the same place, in the same format. By including
structured logging in the standard library, we can provide a common framework
that all the other structured logging packages can share.</p>
<h2 id="a-tour-of-slog">A tour of <code>slog</code></h2>
<p>Here is the simplest program that uses <code>slog</code>:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import "log/slog"

func main() {
    slog.Info("hello, world")
}
</code></pre>
<p>As of this writing, it prints:</p>
<pre><code>2023/08/04 16:09:19 INFO hello, world
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Info</code> function prints a message at the Info log level using the
default logger, which in this case is the default logger from the <code>log</code>
package—the same logger you get when you write <code>log.Printf</code>.
That explains why the output looks so similar: only the “INFO” is new.
Out of the box, <code>slog</code> and the original <code>log</code> package work together to make it
easy to get started.</p>
<p>Besides <code>Info</code>, there are functions for three other levels—<code>Debug</code>, <code>Warn</code>, and
<code>Error</code>—as well as a more general <code>Log</code> function that takes the level as an
argument. In <code>slog</code>, levels are just integers, so you aren’t limited to the four
named levels. For example, <code>Info</code> is zero and <code>Warn</code> is 4, so if your logging system
has a level in between those, you can use 2 for it.</p>
<p>Unlike with the <code>log</code> package, we can easily add key-value pairs to our output
by writing them after the message:</p>
<pre><code>slog.Info("hello, world", "user", os.Getenv("USER"))
</code></pre>
<p>The output now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>2023/08/04 16:27:19 INFO hello, world user=jba
</code></pre>
<p>As we mentioned, <code>slog</code>’s top-level functions use the default logger.
We can get this logger explicitly, and call its methods:</p>
<pre><code>logger := slog.Default()
logger.Info("hello, world", "user", os.Getenv("USER"))
</code></pre>
<p>Every top-level function corresponds to a method on a <code>slog.Logger</code>.
The output is the same as before.</p>
<p>Initially, slog’s output goes through the default <code>log.Logger</code>, producing the
output we’ve seen above.
We can change the output by changing the <em>handler</em> used by the logger.
<code>slog</code> comes with two built-in handlers.
A <code>TextHandler</code> emits all log information in the form <code>key=value</code>.
This program creates a new logger using a <code>TextHandler</code> and
makes the same call to the <code>Info</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>logger := slog.New(slog.NewTextHandler(os.Stdout, nil))
logger.Info("hello, world", "user", os.Getenv("USER"))
</code></pre>
<p>Now the output looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>time=2023-08-04T16:56:03.786-04:00 level=INFO msg="hello, world" user=jba
</code></pre>
<p>Everything has been turned into a key-value pair, with strings quoted as needed to preserve structure.</p>
<p>For JSON output, install the built-in <code>JSONHandler</code> instead:</p>
<pre><code>logger := slog.New(slog.NewJSONHandler(os.Stdout, nil))
logger.Info("hello, world", "user", os.Getenv("USER"))
</code></pre>
<p>Now our output is a sequence of JSON objects, one per logging call:</p>
<pre><code>{"time":"2023-08-04T16:58:02.939245411-04:00","level":"INFO","msg":"hello, world","user":"jba"}
</code></pre>
<p>You are not limited to the built-in handlers. Anyone can write a handler by
implementing the <code>slog.Handler</code> interface. A handler can generate output in a
particular format, or it can wrap another handler to add functionality.
One of the
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog@master#example-Handler-LevelHandler" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">examples</a> in
the <code>slog</code> documentation shows how to write a wrapping handler that changes the minimum
level at which log messages will be displayed.</p>
<p>The alternating key-value syntax for attributes that we’ve been using so far is convenient, but for frequently executed log statements it may be more efficient to use the <code>Attr</code> type and call the <code>LogAttrs</code> method.
These work together to minimize memory allocations.
There are functions for building <code>Attr</code>s out of strings, numbers, and other common
types. This call to <code>LogAttrs</code> produces the same output as above, but does it faster:</p>
<pre><code>slog.LogAttrs(context.Background(), slog.LevelInfo, "hello, world",
    slog.String("user", os.Getenv("USER")))
</code></pre>
<p>There is a lot more to <code>slog</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As the call to <code>LogAttrs</code> shows, you can pass a <code>context.Context</code> to some log functions
so a handler can extract context information like trace IDs. (Canceling the context does not prevent the log entry from being written.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can call <code>Logger.With</code> to add attributes to a logger that will appear in
all of its output, effectively factoring out the common parts of several log
statements. This is not only convenient, but it can also help performance, as discussed below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attributes can be combined into groups. This can add more structure to your
log output and can help to disambiguate keys that would otherwise be identical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can control how a value appears in the logs by providing its type with a <code>LogValue</code>
method. That can be used to <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog@master#example-LogValuer-Group" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">log the fields of a struct as a
group</a> or <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog@master#example-LogValuer-Secret" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">redact
sensitive data</a>,
among other things.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The best place to learn about all of <code>slog</code> is the <a href="https://pkg.dev.go/log/slog" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">package
documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>We wanted <code>slog</code> to be fast.
For large-scale performance gains, we designed <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog#Handler" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">the <code>Handler</code>
interface</a> to provide optimization
opportunities. The <code>Enabled</code> method is called at the beginning of every log
event, giving the handler a chance to drop unwanted log events quickly. The
<code>WithAttrs</code> and <code>WithGroup</code> methods let the handler format
attributes added by <code>Logger.With</code> once, rather than at each logging call. This
pre-formatting can provide a significant speedup when large attributes, like an
<code>http.Request</code>, are added to a <code>Logger</code> and then used in many logging calls.</p>
<p>To inform our performance optimization work, we investigated typical patterns of logging in existing open-source projects. We found that over 95%
of calls to logging methods pass five or fewer attributes. We also categorized
the types of attributes, finding that a handful of common types accounted for
the majority.
We then wrote benchmarks that captured the common cases, and used them as a
guide to see where the time went.
The greatest gains came from paying careful attention to memory allocation.</p>
<h2 id="the-design-process">The design process</h2>
<p>The <code>slog</code> package is one of the largest additions to the standard library since
Go 1 was released in 2012. We wanted to take our time designing it, and we knew
that community feedback would be essential.</p>
<p>By April 2022, we had gathered enough data to demonstrate the importance of
structured logging to the Go community. The Go team decided to explore adding it
to the standard library.</p>
<p>We began by looking at how the existing structured logging packages were
designed. We also took advantage of the large collection of open-source Go code
stored on the Go module proxy to learn how these packages were actually used.
Our first design was informed by this research as well as Go’s spirit of
simplicity.
We wanted an API that is light on the page and easy to understand, without
sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>It was never a goal to replace existing third-party logging packages.
They are all good at what they do, and replacing existing code that works well
is rarely a good use of a developer’s time.
We divided the API into a frontend, <code>Logger</code>, that calls a backend interface, <code>Handler</code>.
That way, existing logging packages can talk to a common backend,
so the packages that use them can interoperate without having to be rewritten.
Handlers are written or in progress for many common logging
packages, including
<a href="https://github.com/uber-go/zap/tree/master/exp/zapslog" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Zap</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/go-logr/logr/pull/196" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">logr</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/evanphx/go-hclog-slog" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">hclog</a>.</p>
<p>We shared our initial design within the Go team and other developers who had
extensive logging experience. We made alterations based on their feedback, and
by August of 2022 we felt we had a workable design. On August 29,
we made our <a href="https://github.com/golang/exp/tree/master/slog" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">experimental
implementation</a> public
and began a <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/discussions/54763" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub discussion</a> to hear
what the community had to say.
The response was enthusiastic and largely positive.
Thanks to insightful comments from the designers and users of other structured
logging packages, we made several changes and added a few features, like groups
and the <code>LogValuer</code> interface. We changed the mapping from log levels to
integers twice.</p>
<p>After two months and about 300 comments, we felt we were ready for an actual
<a href="https://go.dev/issue/56345" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">proposal</a> and accompanying <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/03441cb358c7b27a8443bca839e5d7a314677ea6/design/56345-structured-logging.md" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">design
doc</a>.
The proposal issue garnered over 800 comments and resulted in many improvements to
the API and the implementation. Here are two examples of API changes, both
concerning <code>context.Context</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Originally the API supported adding loggers to a
context. Many felt that this was a convenient way to plumb a logger easily
through levels of code that didn’t care about it. But others felt it was
smuggling in  an implicit dependency, making the code harder to understand.
Ultimately, we removed the feature as being too controversial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also wrestled
with the related question of passing a context to logging methods, trying a
number of designs. We initially resisted the standard pattern of passing the
context as the first argument because we didn’t want every logging call to
require a context, but ultimately created two sets of logging methods, one
with a context and one without.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One change we did not make concerned the alternating key-and-value syntax for
expressing attributes:</p>
<pre><code>slog.Info("message", "k1", v1, "k2", v2)
</code></pre>
<p>Many felt strongly that this was a bad idea. They found it hard to read
and easy to get wrong by omitting a key or value. They preferred explicit
attributes for expressing structure:</p>
<pre><code>slog.Info("message", slog.Int("k1", v1), slog.String("k2", v2))
</code></pre>
<p>But we felt that the lighter syntax was important to keeping Go easy and fun to
use, especially for new Go programmers. We also knew that several Go logging
packages, like <code>logr</code>, <code>go-kit/log</code> and <code>zap</code> (with its <code>SugaredLogger</code>)
successfully used alternating keys and
values. We added a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/slog" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">vet
check</a>
to catch common mistakes, but did not change the design.</p>
<p>On March 15, 2023, the proposal was accepted, but there were still some minor
unresolved issues. Over the next few weeks, ten additional changes were proposed
and resolved. By early July, the <code>log/slog</code> package implementation was complete,
along with the <code>testing/slogtest</code> package for verifying
handlers and the vet check for correct usage of alternating keys and values.</p>
<p>And on August 8, Go 1.21 was released, and <code>slog</code> with it.
We hope you find it useful, and as fun to use as it was to build.</p>
<p>And a big thanks to everyone who participated in the discussion and the proposal
process. Your contributions improved <code>slog</code> immensely.</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">documentation</a> for the <code>log/slog</code> package
explains how to use it and provides several examples.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Resources-for-slog" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">wiki page</a> has
additional resources provided by the Go community, including a variety of
handlers.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My 12 year old dev account <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=darken"><code>darken</code></a> was just terminated.</p>

<p>I was having a pretty good week until now :(.</p>

<p>I didn't think I would make such a post one day but here it is:</p>

<p>At 21:44 i got two mails saying my apps "SD Maid 1" and "SD Maid 2" have been suspended and removed for violating:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Stalkerware policy".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>16 minutes later at 22:00 they nuked my whole account:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reason for termination: We have identified a pattern of high risk or abuse associated with your Developer Account and are taking this action pursuant to Section 8.3/10.3 of Google Play’s Developer Distribution Agreement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm at a loss here why. I obviously don't stalk anyone, and the app has no functionality that supports stalking in any way. Both apps "in short" free storage space.</p>

<p>SD Maid 1 has millions of users and been in the Google Play store for over a decade. There was no major change. Yesterday I bumped the target SDK to 33, but that's about it.</p>

<p>For those who don't know the app, </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ws-5mwcgm6EJ:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Deu.thedarken.sdm%26hl%3Dde&amp;cd=10&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=dk">here is the cached play store site:</a></li>
</ul>

<p>SD Maid 2 is a rewrite of the same app because I couldn't keep the spaghetti code in check that is needed to handle the different storage access patterns (SAF) etc.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:gvOXGR2TpwQJ:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Deu.darken.sdmse%26hl%3Den_US&amp;cd=11&amp;hl=de&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=dk">Here is a cached link to the playstore</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>And for this one the code is even open-source: <a href="https://github.com/d4rken-org/sdmaid-se">https://github.com/d4rken-org/sdmaid-se</a></strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>AI mistake? Crackdown on "cleaner apps"?</p>

<p>There's another dev here who was hit at the same time just now:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/15xi4iw/app_suspension_confused_policy/">https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/15xi4iw/app_suspension_confused_policy/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If Google suddenly changes their policy and disallows some types apps, then they can do so, but why end my indie dev career?</p>

<p>I'd love to talk to someone at Google, because I don't understand it. But no matter how much money you made Google or millions of users you have, I don't have any way to talk to someone.</p>

<p>I fear that you only get once chance to appeal and I'm not even sure what to appeal. I don't think the "your AI got it wrong route" is effective. </p>

<p>Talk to me my fellow devs, I'm pretty upset :(.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<header><p>22 Aug 2023</p></header><p>Conformant OpenGL®
ES 3.1 drivers are now available for M1- and M2-family GPUs. That means
the drivers are compatible with any OpenGL ES 3.1 application.
Interested? <a href="https://fedora-asahi-remix.org/">Just install
Linux!</a></p>
<p>Once you’ve installed <a href="https://asahilinux.org/">Asahi
Linux</a>, upgrade your system with
<code>dnf upgrade</code> (Fedora) or
<code>pacman -Syu</code> (Arch) for the
latest drivers.</p>
<p>Our reverse-engineered, free and <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/asahi/mesa">open source graphics
drivers</a> are the world’s <strong><em>only</em></strong> conformant
OpenGL ES 3.1 implementation for M1- and M2-family graphics hardware.
That means our driver passed tens of thousands of tests to demonstrate
correctness and is now recognized by the industry.</p>
<p>To become conformant, an “implementation” must pass the official
conformance test suite, designed to verify every feature in the
specification. The test results are submitted to Khronos, the standards
body. After a <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/">30-day review
period</a>, if no issues are found, the implementation becomes
conformant. The Khronos website lists all conformant implementations,
including our drivers for the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/opengles#submission_1007">M1</a>,
<a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/opengles#submission_1014">M1
Pro/Max/Ultra</a>, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/opengles#submission_1016">M2</a>,
and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/opengles#submission_1017">M2
Pro/Max</a>.</p>
<p>Today’s milestone isn’t just about OpenGL ES. We’re releasing the
first conformant implementation of <em>any</em> graphics standard for
the M1. And we don’t plan to stop here ;-)</p>
<p><a href="https://rosenzweig.io/vkinstancing.webp"><img src="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/vkinstancing2.webp" alt="Teaser of the “Vulkan instancing” demo running on Asahi Linux"></a></p>
<p>Unlike ours, the manufacturer’s M1 drivers are unfortunately not
conformant for <em>any</em> standard graphics API, whether Vulkan or
OpenGL or OpenGL ES. That means that there is no guarantee that
applications using the standards will work on your M1/M2 (if you’re not
running Linux). This isn’t just a theoretical issue. Consider Vulkan.
The third-party <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK">MoltenVK</a> layers a
subset of Vulkan on top of the proprietary drivers. However, those
drivers lack key functionality, breaking valid Vulkan applications. That
hinders developers and users alike, if they haven’t yet switched their
M1/M2 computers to Linux.</p>
<p>Why did <em>we</em> pursue standards conformance when the
manufacturer did not? Above all, our commitment to quality. We want our
users to know that they can depend on our Linux drivers. We want
standard software to run without M1-specific hacks or porting. We want
to set the right example for the ecosystem: the way forward is
implementing open standards, conformant to the specifications, without
compromises for “portability”. We are not satisfied with proprietary
drivers, proprietary APIs, and refusal to implement standards. The rest
of the industry knows that progress comes from cross-vendor
collaboration. We know it, too. Achieving conformance is a win for our
community, for open source, and for open graphics.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://vt.social/@lina/">Asahi Lina</a> and I
are two individuals with minimal funding. It’s a little awkward that we
beat the big corporation…</p>
<p>It’s not too late though. They should follow our lead!</p>
<hr>
<p>OpenGL ES 3.1 updates the experimental <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/opengl3-on-asahi-linux.html">OpenGL ES
3.0 and OpenGL 3.1</a> we shipped in June. Notably, ES 3.1 adds compute
shaders, typically used to accelerate general computations within
graphics applications. For example, a 3D game could run its physics
simulations in a compute shader. The simulation results can then be used
for rendering, eliminating stalls that would otherwise be required to
synchronize the GPU with a CPU physics simulation. That lets the game
run faster.</p>
<p>Let’s zoom in on one new feature: atomics on images. Older versions
of OpenGL ES allowed an application to read an image in order to display
it on screen. ES 3.1 allows the application to <em>write</em> to the
image, typically from a compute shader. This new feature enables
flexible image processing algorithms, which previously needed to fit
into the fixed-function 3D pipeline. However, GPUs are massively
parallel, running thousands of threads at the same time. If two threads
write to the same location, there is a conflict: depending which thread
runs first, the result will be different. We have a race condition.</p>
<p>“Atomic” access to memory provides a solution to race conditions.
With atomics, special hardware in the memory subsystem guarantees
consistent, well-defined results for select operations, regardless of
the order of the threads. Modern graphics hardware supports various
atomic operations, like addition, serving as building blocks to complex
parallel algorithms.</p>
<p>Can we put these two features together to write to an image
atomically?</p>
<p>Yes. A ubiquitous OpenGL ES <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/extensions/OES/OES_shader_image_atomic.txt">extension</a>,
required for ES 3.2, adds atomics operating on pixels in an image. For
example, a compute shader could atomically increment the value at pixel
(10, 20).</p>
<p>Other GPUs have dedicated instructions to perform atomics on an
images, making the driver implementation straightforward. For us, the
story is more complicated. The M1 lacks hardware instructions for image
atomics, even though it has non-image atomics and non-atomic images. We
need to reframe the problem.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: to perform an atomic on a pixel, we instead
calculate the address of the pixel in memory and perform a regular
atomic on that address. Since the hardware supports regular atomics, our
task is “just” calculating the pixel’s address.</p>
<p>If the image were laid out linearly in memory, this would be
straightforward: multiply the Y-coordinate by the number of bytes per
row (“stride”), multiply the X-coordinate by the number of bytes per
pixel, and add. That gives the pixel’s offset in bytes relative to the
first pixel of the image. To get the final address, we add that offset
to the address of the first pixel.</p>

<p>Alas, images are rarely linear in memory. To improve cache
efficiency, modern graphics hardware interleaves the X- and
Y-coordinates. Instead of one row after the next, pixels in memory
follow a <a href="https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/texture-tiling-and-swizzling/">spiral-like
curve</a>.</p>
<p>We need to amend our previous equation to interleave the coordinates.
We could use many instructions to mask one bit at a time, shifting to
construct the interleaved result, but that’s inefficient. We can do
better.</p>
<p>There is a well-known <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#InterleaveBMN">“bit
twiddling” algorithm to interleave bits</a>. Rather than shuffle one bit
at a time, the algorithm shuffles groups of bits, parallelizing the
problem. Implementing this algorithm in shader code improves
performance.</p>
<p>In practice, only the lower 7-bits (or less) of each coordinate are
interleaved. That lets us use 32-bit instructions to “vectorize” the
interleave, by putting the X- and Y-coordinates in the low and high
16-bits of a 32-bit register. Those 32-bit instructions let us
interleave X and Y at the same time, halving the instruction count.
Plus, we can exploit the GPU’s combined shift-and-add instruction.
Putting the tricks together, we interleave in 10 instructions of M1 GPU
assembly:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"># Inputs x<span>,</span> y in r0l<span>,</span> r0h<span>.</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"># Output in r1<span>.</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>add</span> r2<span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> r0<span>,</span> lsl <span>4</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><span>or</span>  r1<span>,</span> r0<span>,</span> r2</span>
<span id="cb1-6"><span>and</span> r1<span>,</span> r1<span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>0xf0f0f0f</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><span>add</span> r2<span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> r1<span>,</span> lsl <span>2</span></span>
<span id="cb1-8"><span>or</span>  r1<span>,</span> r1<span>,</span> r2</span>

<p>We could stop here, but what if there’s a <em>dedicated</em>
instruction to interleave bits? PowerVR has a “shuffle” instruction <a href="https://docs.imgtec.com/reference-manuals/powervr-instruction-set-reference/topics/bitwise-instructions/SHFL.html"><code>shfl</code></a>,
and the M1 GPU borrows from PowerVR. Perhaps that instruction was
borrowed too. Unfortunately, even if it was, the proprietary compiler
won’t use it when compiling our test shaders. That makes it difficult to
reverse-engineer the instruction – if it exists – by observing compiled
shaders.</p>
<p>It’s time to dust off a powerful reverse-engineering technique from
magic kindergarten: guess and check.</p>
<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@dougall">Dougall Johnson</a>
provided the guess. When considering the instructions we already know
about, he took special notice of the “reverse bits” instruction. Since
reversing bits is a type of bit shuffle, the interleave instruction
should be encoded similarly. The bit reverse instruction has a two-bit
field specifying the operation, with value <code>01</code>. Related
instructions to <em>count the number of set bits</em> and <em>find the
first set bit</em> have values <code>10</code> and <code>11</code>
respectively. That encompasses all known “complex bit manipulation”
instructions.</p>

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>00</code></td>
<td><strong><a href="" onclick="const p = document.createElement('span');p.innerText = 'Interleave!';this.replaceWith(p);document.getElementById('center-rule').remove();return false;">?
? ?</a></strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>01</code></td>
<td>Reverse bits</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>10</code></td>
<td>Count set bits</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>11</code></td>
<td>Find first set</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There is one value of the two-bit enumeration that is unobserved and
unknown: <code>00</code>. If this interleave instruction exists, it’s
probably encoded like the bit reverse but with operation code
<code>00</code> instead of <code>01</code>.</p>
<p>There’s a difficulty: the three known instructions have one single
input source, but our instruction interleaves two sources. Where does
the second source go? We can make a guess based on symmetry. Presumably
to simplify the hardware decoder, M1 GPU instructions usually encode
their sources in consistent locations across instructions. The other
three instructions have a gap where we would expect the second source to
be, in a two-source arithmetic instruction. Probably the second source
is there.</p>
<p>Armed with a guess, it’s our turn to check. Rather than handwrite GPU
assembly, we can hack our compiler to replace some two-source integer
operation (like multiply) with our guessed encoding of “interleave”.
Then we write a compute shader using this operation (by “multiplying”
numbers) and run it with the newfangled compute support in our
driver.</p>
<p>All that’s left is writing a <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/interleave.shader_test">shader</a> that
checks that the mystery instruction returns the interleaved result for
each possible input. Since the instruction takes two 16-bit sources,
there are about 4 billion
(<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mn>2</mn><mn>32</mn></msup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2^32</annotation></semantics></math>)
inputs. With our driver, the M1 GPU manages to check them all in under a
second, and the verdict is in: this is our interleave instruction.</p>
<p>As for our clever vectorized assembly to interleave coordinates? We
can replace it with one instruction. It’s anticlimactic, but it’s fast
and it passes the conformance tests.</p>
<p>And that’s what matters.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Earlier this year myself and a couple others at DrDoctor did some training in C4 Architecture modelling<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The trainer was really good and over a few sessions with him we got the hang of the method. We went onto use what we had learnt, meeting everything Thursday over the course of 3 months. We focused mainly on modelling our existing architecture into Level 1 (Context) and Level 2 (Container) diagrams. This process was enlightening and we all learnt a lot from it - that alone could easily be a couple of posts.</p>
<p>I have had two main takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the training itself, is that <strong>the C4 method provides a consistent language</strong> which can be used when talking about architecture</li>
<li>From using and applying the C4 method, is that diagrams can be <strong>an enabler for better conversations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before digging into the benefits that come from having C4 diagrams, there are two limitations in particular that I would like to highlight.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The C4 Model does not provide a standard way of communicating the story of your architecture in written form. Given all the things it does well, provides consistent language, introduce detail/complexity incrementally through different levels of diagrams, this felt like an oversight and something that would be really useful to have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lack of real-world examples available - this obviously isn’t a limitation of the model itself but rather due to the fact that companies don’t want to advertise their architecture in detail in public. However it does mean that understanding how to practically apply the model outside of the public examples available is difficult.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We had a number of sessions with Brian from <a href="https://buildingbetterteams.de/diagram-your-architecture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">buildingbetterteams.de</a>, he was able to walk us through the basics and then guide us through the process of modelling our existing architecture (company money well spent).</p>
<h2 id="situations-where-diagrams-have-been-an-enabler">Situations where diagrams have been an enabler</h2>
<h3 id="onboarding-new-team-members">Onboarding new team members</h3>
<p>You can imagine when onboarding new engineers to a team the conversation goes something like this</p>
<ol>
<li>git clone /path/to/repository</li>
<li>open in [your IDE of choice]</li>
<li>why haven’t you finished your first story/task/ticket yet?</li>
</ol>
<p>(Thankfully this isn’t how we do onboarding at DrDoctor). One of the things that is missing from the above, one of the many things missing, is context. Even if you follow “best practices” around Clean/Hexagonal/DDD layout for your code/solution, it’s still confusing. Questions will still need to be asked and answered:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the main entry point?</li>
<li>What are (if any) the interactions between projects?</li>
<li>What external dependencies are there?</li>
<li>Do any external projects depend on this solution?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where having C4 architecture docs has come in handy, they have served as a starting point for helping new engineers build up their mental model of the architecture, interactions and dependencies of new projects.</p>
<p>It’s worth adding, that the diagrams I’ve been using with my team have been useful not only for new engineers but also for our Engineering Manager and Technical Product Manager - specially to help them understand the complexity of the project that we’re working in, and to understand why some piece of work are more complicated than others.</p>
<h3 id="planning-upcoming-work">Planning upcoming work</h3>
<p>As a team we have recently been preparing to build out a new piece of major functionality for an existing system. Understanding the what of the functionality was straightforward enough. But to get to the how was enabled by having a decent (ie pretty good/good enough) architecture diagram. The architecture diagrams were useful as prompts for conversation.</p>
<p>The diagrams gave all team members something to centre around, it also gave everyone common language to use.</p>
<p>They also helped us to think about iterative ways to deliver the end goal. Being able to visualise the end state of what we wanted to deliver helped us think about how we could do this incrementally. If we had only spoken about this verbally I don’t think we would have or could have, come to the same conclusions about how we wanted to go about building this.</p>
<h3 id="communicating-changes-to-other-teams">Communicating changes to other teams</h3>
<p>Following on from the previous point, this new piece of functionality that we’re setting out ot build involves making some changes to the larger architectural landscape at DrDoctor. Which means that we are going to be making changes to how some projects which are <em>owned</em> by other teams function. Having architecture diagrams to communicate the scope of change to other Leads has been a game changer. Once again, the diagrams were useful as the centre piece of conversations and helped others outside our team to build up a mental model of what we were setting out to change.</p>
<p>I was also able to easily talk though the iterations we would be going through to deliver the end state.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>I still feel like I’m early in my journey of building (or drawing) architecture diagrams, however based on recent experiences I can see the immense value they bring to an engineering team. These benefits reinforce that the time and effort put into creating and maintaining architecture diagrams is time well spent.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focuses communication:</strong> Having a diagram to centre conversations around has been a game changer, the focus is taken off an individual and put on something that can be reasoned about, questioned, probed without it feeling personal</li>
<li><strong>Universal understanding:</strong> Diagrams being visual in nature help technical and non-technical folks to understand the interaction points and dependencies. They also provide common language for all team members to use.</li>
<li><strong>Facilitates planning:</strong> Having diagrams has been incredibly helpful during the planning process (of big and small pieces of functionality) particularly when a team consists of a number of new team members, being able to refer to components and understand the scope of change that a piece of functionality will have helps the team to understand the complexity of the change</li>
</ul>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Based on the prettymaps project</h2>
<p dir="auto">Prettymapp is based on a rewrite of the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/marceloprates/prettymaps">prettymaps</a> project by
<a href="https://github.com/marceloprates">@marceloprates</a>. All credit for the original idea, designs and implementation go to him.
The prettymapp rewrite focuses on speed and adapted configuration to interface with the webapp.
It drops more complex configuration options in favour of improved speed, reduced code complexity and
simplified configuration interfaces. It is partially tested and adds a <a href="https://streamlit.io/" rel="nofollow">streamlit</a> webapp component.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Python package</h2>
<p dir="auto">You can also use prettymapp without the webapp, directly in Python. This lets you customize the functionality or

		<p>The world we live in has never been more interconnected, giving people access to more multilingual content than ever before. This also makes the ability to communicate and understand information in any language increasingly important.</p>
<p>Today, we’re introducing SeamlessM4T, the first all-in-one multimodal and multilingual AI translation model that allows people to communicate effortlessly through speech and text across different languages. SeamlessM4T supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speech recognition for nearly 100 languages</li>
<li>Speech-to-text translation for nearly 100 input and output languages</li>
<li>Speech-to-speech translation, supporting nearly 100 input languages and 36 (including English) output languages</li>
<li>Text-to-text translation for nearly 100 languages</li>
<li>Text-to-speech translation, supporting nearly 100 input languages and 35 (including English) output languages</li>
</ul>
<p>In keeping with our approach to open science, we’re publicly releasing SeamlessM4T under a research license to allow researchers and developers to build on this work. We’re also releasing the metadata of SeamlessAlign, the biggest open multimodal translation dataset to date, totaling 270,000 hours of mined speech and text alignments.</p>
<p>Building a universal language translator, like the fictional Babel Fish in <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>, is challenging because existing speech-to-speech and speech-to-text systems only cover a small fraction of the world’s languages. But we believe the work we’re announcing today is a significant step forward in this journey. Compared to approaches using separate models, SeamlessM4T’s single system approach reduces errors and delays, increasing the efficiency and quality of the translation process. This enables people who speak different languages to communicate with each other more effectively.</p>
<p><video id="video-39105-2" width="960" height="540" poster="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01_Seamless-Multitasking_COVER.png" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01_Seamless-Multitasking-video.mp4?_=2"><a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01_Seamless-Multitasking-video.mp4">https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01_Seamless-Multitasking-video.mp4</a></video></p>
<p>SeamlessM4T builds on advancements we and others have made over the years in the quest to create a universal translator. Last year, we released No Language Left Behind (NLLB), a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/07/new-meta-ai-model-translates-200-languages-making-technology-more-accessible/">text-to-text machine translation model</a> that supports 200 languages, and has since been integrated into Wikipedia as one of the translation providers. We also shared a demo of our <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/10/hokkien-ai-speech-translation/">Universal Speech Translator</a>, which was the first direct speech-to-speech translation system for Hokkien, a language without a widely used writing system. And earlier this year, we revealed <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/05/ai-massively-multilingual-speech-technology/">Massively Multilingual Speech</a>, which provides speech recognition, language identification and speech synthesis technology across more than 1,100 languages.</p>
<p>SeamlessM4T draws on findings from all of these projects to enable a multilingual and multimodal translation experience stemming from a single model, built across a wide range of spoken data sources with state-of-the-art results.</p>
<p>This is only the latest step in our ongoing effort to build AI-powered technology that helps connect people across languages. In the future, we want to explore how this foundational model can enable new communication capabilities — ultimately bringing us closer to a world where everyone can be understood.</p>

    <p>Most Americans have very little choice but to provide their personal information to credit bureaus. Hackers have found a way into that data supply chain, and are advertising access in group chats used by violent criminals who rob, assault, and shoot targets.

              <!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It took only a few seconds to uncover the target’s entire life.</p><p>On the messaging app Telegram, I entered a tiny amount of information about my target into the dark blue text box—their name and the state I believed they lived in—and pressed enter. A short while later, the bot spat out a file containing every address that person had ever lived at in the U.S., all the way back to their college dorm more than a decade earlier. The file included the names and birth years of their relatives. It listed the target’s mobile phone numbers and provider, as well as personal email addresses. Finally, the file contained information from their drivers’ license, including its unique identification number. All of that data cost $15 in Bitcoin. The bot sometimes offers the Social Security number too for $20.</p><p>This is the result of a secret weapon criminals are selling access to online that appears to tap into an especially powerful set of data: the target’s credit header. This is personal information that the credit bureaus Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion have on most adults in America via their credit cards. Through a complex web of agreements and purchases, that data trickles down from the credit bureaus to other companies who offer it to debt collectors, insurance companies, and law enforcement.</p><p>A 404 Media investigation has found that criminals have managed to tap into that data supply chain, in some cases by stealing former law enforcement officer’s identities, and are selling unfettered access to their criminal cohorts online. The tool 404 Media tested has also been used to gather information on high profile targets such as Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, and even President Joe Biden, seemingly without restriction. 404 Media verified that although not always sensitive, at least some of that data is accurate.</p><p>The communities where this tool is advertised include chat rooms focused on swatting, where criminals place bogus calls that result in a heavily armed police response to a specific location; SIM swapping, in which hackers take over a victim’s phone number to then receive login codes and break into their online accounts; and physical violence, where criminals hire one another to rob, shoot, or assault their enemies and vandalize the target’s home. Overall, the tool offers exceptional power and requires little to no technical sophistication to obtain a victim’s sensitive data. Worse yet, it is exceedingly difficult for a user to opt out, and this data may be available even for people who have otherwise been careful with distributing their personal information, and who have taken steps to have their details scrubbed from other data brokers.</p><p>Senator Ron Wyden told 404 Media in a statement that “These companies have demonstrated that they can't control who has access to their data products. The government needs to stop these companies from packaging and selling our personal information, and the senior executives that put profit over national security and Americans' safety should be punished accordingly.”</p><h3 id="the-supply-chain">The Supply Chain</h3><p>Eighty-two percent of American adults had a credit card in 2022, according to <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2023-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2022-banking-credit.htm">data from the Federal Reserve</a>. Whenever someone applies for a credit card, their financial institution transfers personal details about the customer to the big three credit bureaus, Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. This is in part so the bureaus can track a user’s credit score. In other words, the majority of the adult population, by the simple fact of how credit cards work, will have their personal information collected and stored by these bureaus.</p><p>The bureaus also play an important role in preventing fraud, by holding onto peoples’ most sensitive personal information and using that to verify their identities. But years ago the bureaus realized they had such a valuable resource of data, and diversified what they did with that information, John Gilmore, head of research at DeleteMe, a company that helps scrub peoples’ data from the internet, said.</p><p>The bureaus made some of the data provided by consumers—known as credit header information—available to other companies. The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/reports/individual-reference-services-report-congress?ref=404media.co">FTC defines credit header information</a> as the portion of a consumer’s credit report that typically contains the person’s name, birth date, current and prior addresses, Social Security number, and telephone number. Essentially, it can include everything on a person’s credit report above the details on who they have borrowed money from—the top, or the header, of the document.</p><p>While credit reports themselves are limited to certain uses such as applications for credit under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), credit bureaus and data brokers generally believe credit header falls under a different piece of legislation: the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). This law gives the credit bureaus room to sell credit header information to third parties under a set of use cases that are much broader than the full credit report. Examples include to protect against fraud <a href="https://secure.accurint.com/bps/509/html/tcol/glb.html?ref=404media.co">or the vague term</a> “holding a legal or beneficial interest relating to the consumer.”</p><p>In February, a group of activist and legal organizations, including the Center on Privacy &amp; Technology at Georgetown Law, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and Just Futures Law, wrote to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) about this legislative issue around credit header data.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->  <div>

<!--kg-card-end: html--><p>That letter says that the bureaus’ position on credit header data comes from a particular reading of a 2011 report written by the FTC, which the bureaus interpret as meaning they don’t have to treat credit header data with the same protections as a full credit report. “This interpretation of the FTC report is erroneous,” the group of organizations wrote.</p><p>The third party companies that buy or receive the credit header information in turn often resell or provide access to it for a fee to private investigators, real estate investors, and other industries. One company called AlumniFinder, for example, sells GLBA data so educational institutions can “reach and engage lost alumni” according to its website. Immigration and Customs Enforcement <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/08/utility-data-government-tracking/?ref=404media.co">has used similar data</a> that flowed from utility companies to Equifax, which then was sold to data brokers. And in March, the FBI and National Counterintelligence and Security Center <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/SafeguardingOurFuture/FINAL_NCSC_FBI_Dont_Be_A_Pawn_Bulletin.pdf?ref=404media.co">warned that foreign intelligence entities working for repressive regimes</a> have sought access to private investigators in part to obtain personal information on targets in the U.S. </p><p>At some point in that trickle down of data, criminals have found a way in.</p><h3 id="tlo-the-bitch">"TLO the bitch"</h3><p>404 Media accessed around 10 Telegram groups where members discuss and advertise bots that offer personally identifiable data for sale. Prices fluctuate between around $15 and $40 depending on what type of data a customer wishes to buy, and as availability ebbs and flows. One person told a group that their tool finds anybody.</p><p>404 Media has seen criminals using the bots specifically for doxing people, meaning publishing their personal information online. In multiple instances, personal information with the same data types as the bot 404 Media used was uploaded to a website popular with cybercriminals and harassers to preserve dox on victims. Members have indicated in their chats and shared dox that they are targeting YouTubers and seemingly ordinary people, as well as the high profile celebrities and politicians.</p><p>Some of those bot-generated dox have been uploaded by users that deal specifically in physical violence. These include groups whose members offer services for a price such as shooting up a house, armed robberies, stabbings, and assault. The cybercrime underground has seen a dramatic rise in violence and harassment over the last few years, with innocent neighbors sometimes being swept up in online fights turned physical. In those violence-as-a-service groups, some members explicitly ask for or offer this type of data.</p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/08/gun-watch-2.jpeg" alt="A photo of a watch and weapon uploaded to a group chat where data access is advertised." loading="lazy" width="720" height="1280" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/gun-watch-2.jpeg 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/08/gun-watch-2.jpeg 720w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A photo of a watch and weapon uploaded to a group chat where data access is advertised.</figcaption></figure><p>The exact data broker the criminals used to to obtain data appears to have changed over time. In January, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7w7xz/crook-sells-access-transunion-tlo-private-investigators?ref=404media.co">I reported</a> criminals were advertising access to a tool called TLOxp, owned by TransUnion. This direct relationship with TransUnion makes TLOxp an especially powerful tool. In one of the few well-documented cases of abuse of TLOxp, in 2018 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/10/12/how-an-amateur-rap-crew-stole-surveillance-tech-that-tracks-almost-every-american/?sh=72a3845950f1&amp;ref=404media.co"><em>Forbes </em>covered how an amateur rap crew</a> used TLOxp as part of a million dollar fraud spree. </p><p>More recent Telegram messages suggest the new wave of cybercriminal access to TLOxp was short-lived, before they moved onto other providers. But judging by the voluminous chatter mentioning it, TLOxp is the database that has caught the cultural zeitgeist of the criminal underground. Talk of TLOxp is now so common that people use it generally to mean a powerful lookup tool. They also use the name of the tool as a verb.</p><p>“I should TLO the bitch huh,” one message reads.</p><p>“Have fun tlo’ing me,” another reads.</p><p>“TLO her,” a third says.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>TransUnion is aware of its brand recognition within the criminal underground. In a statement, TransUnion said that “At times, fraudsters will pull data from other sources and misrepresent it as TLOxp data.” The company added it deploys various safeguards and protections to ensure its data is only used as legally permitted, but acknowledged unauthorized parties do sometimes gain access.</p><p>“On the very rare occasion where we confirm misuse of TLOxp, we coordinate with law enforcement to help prosecute those responsible,” TransUnion added.</p><p>Beyond TLO, criminals have mentioned multiple different companies in the Telegram groups they claim to use: Data-Trac, SearchBug, and USinfoSearch among them. </p><p>Data-Trac told 404 Media that someone gained access to its tool by stealing the identity of a former law enforcement officer and private investigator in Florida. The criminal then opened an account with those credentials, which included a drivers’ license. Data-Trac said it is working with law enforcement on an active case concerning the incident.</p><p>Normally, data brokers verify who a private investigator customer is by performing an on-site visit to the customer’s office. They’ll verify the private investigator has a locked filing cabinet and shredder for properly handling records. Data-Trac, however, said at the time of the criminal gaining access, the company only performed “remote confirmation,” where the applicant is asked to provide various pieces of identity and security verification virtually rather than in-person.</p><p>Noah Wieder, CEO of SearchBug, confirmed his tool had been used to look up around half a dozen names 404 Media identified as being targets of criminals. Those included Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, President Biden, as well as some rappers and others who don’t appear to be celebrities. Spotify, which hosts Rogan’s podcast, did not respond to a request for comment. X, the site previously known as Twitter and which Musk owns, did not respond either. A spokesperson for the National Security Council declined to comment when asked about the tool being used against President Biden and instead directed the request to the CFPB.</p><p>Wieder said he didn’t know whether SearchBug’s own data provider gave it credit header data specifically, but said it was the responsibility of the data supplier to block requests for lookups on high profile individuals like celebrities and politicians.</p><div><p><strong>Do you know anything else about the sale of credit header data? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at +44 20 8133 5190. Otherwise, send me an email at joseph@404media.co.</strong></p></div><p>In response to 404 Media’s findings, Wieder said SearchBug will now perform those blocks itself. The same day Wieder said SearchBug would introduce those limits, one bot seller said on Telegram their bot would now face restrictions; they later told their customers to not look up celebrities or public officials.</p><p>USinfoSearch, meanwhile, said its tool had not been used to lookup any of the names criminals targeted, but criminal chatter shows a high level of interest in the company. Scott Hostettler, general manager of USinfoSearch, told 404 Media in an email that “the security and protection of our licensed databases and information is at the very top of our priorities and our systems are monitored continuously.”</p><p>“We understand the importance of protecting sensitive information and upholding the trust of our users is our top priority. Any allegation that we have provided data to criminals is in direct opposition to our fundamental principles and the protective measures we have established and continually monitor to prevent any unauthorized disclosure,” he added.</p><p>Other companies mentioned by the criminals, including Microbilt and another called LocatePlus, did not respond to requests for comment. In 2019, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/nepxbz/i-gave-a-bounty-hunter-300-dollars-located-phone-microbilt-zumigo-tmobile?ref=404media.co">I reported that Microbilt was part of a supply chain of location data</a> from telecoms that ended up with bounty hunters being able to instantly pinpoint most phones inside the U.S.</p><p>Regardless, Julie Mao, co-founder and deputy director of Just Futures Law, which <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/08/utility-data-government-tracking/?ref=404media.co">has campaigned against ICE’s use of similar data</a>, said “it’s likely that at least some of this data (and wouldn’t be surprised if it’s almost all) is credit header info” after reviewing a sample of the data generated by the tested bot.</p><h3 id="the-near-impossibility-of-removal">The Near Impossibility of Removal</h3><p>In 404 Media’s own tests, while DeleteMe is a helpful tool at removing personal information from a myriad of people-search sites, at the time of writing it does not appear to cover the sites these criminals are using, nor does it prevent the tested Telegram bot from gaining access to information that is otherwise not easily available.</p><p>Gilmore from DeleteMe said that the company is constantly adding new services to track, and some are more responsive than others. That game of whack-a-mole presents another, more fundamental issue. Curtailing the spread of credit header information will persist until it is stopped at the source: the credit bureaus.</p><p>But for the ordinary consumer, it can be very difficult to get the credit bureaus to stop selling their data to third-parties, and perhaps impossible to have them delete it entirely, given their continued role in combating fraud.</p><p>“They will not remove you from their datasets, but they will not sell it in certain conditions,” Gilmore said. The bureaus make the process very onerous, Gilmore added. “They never purge the header data, because that is necessary for fraud checks.”</p><p>Of course, even if a person did manage to get the bureaus to stop distributing their data, if a third party has already obtained a copy, that data may still find its way out. And then it’s very difficult for someone to learn which of the avalanche of companies sold or provided their data to others as well.</p><p>Privacy and legal campaigners think the solution is plugging the flow of credit header data at the bureaus. “We really believe that the real, fundamental problem is that this information is being bought and sold to begin with,” Mao said. “When consumers can’t opt-out or organize to have an actual option to protect privacy, that’s precisely the role of government bodies.</p><p>“This is precisely why regulation is key,” she added.</p><p>“It should absolutely not be allowed,” Rob Shavell, CEO of DeleteMe said of credit bureaus feeding credit header data to wider industries. Of all the entities that are the root cause of this data, “the credit bureaus are number one,” Shavell added. “They are the ones that should be subject to the strictest compliance and ultimately be held to a higher privacy standard by the federal government and by state governments than they are being,” he said.</p><blockquote>“The credit bureaus are number one.”</blockquote><p>In March, the CFPB <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/notice-opportunities-comment/open-notices/request-for-information-regarding-data-brokers-and-other-business-practices-involving-the-collection-and-sale-of-consumer-information/?ref=404media.co">put out a request for information</a> about data brokers, where organizations can write-in with their concerns about the trade of data. Last week, the CFPB announced it was proposing new rules that would change the regulation of credit header data. Under those proposals, brokers would not be able to sell such data for targeted advertising, training AI, or to perpetrators of domestic violence, according to an overview of the proposed rule provided by the CFPB. Brokers could still sell credit header data for other purposes like insurance and credit underwriting, and employment and government benefit applications.</p><p>On the face of it, those proposed rule changes may not curb the criminal access or abuse uncovered by 404 Media. When asked for the CFPB’s comment on criminals who carry out physical violence obtaining credit header data, the CFPB shared a quote from the agency’s director Rohit Chopra which again addressed artificial intelligence and not the kind of criminal abuse of the data reported by 404 Media.</p><p>“Reports about monetization of sensitive information—everything from the financial details of members of the U.S. military to lists of specific people experiencing dementia—are particularly worrisome when data is powering ‘artificial intelligence’ and other automated decision-making about our lives. The CFPB will be taking steps to ensure that modern-day data brokers in the surveillance industry know that they cannot engage in illegal collection and sharing of our data,” the statement said.</p><p>The CFPB’s announcement made no explicit mention of the sale of credit header data to private investigators, which is how criminals have managed to access such sensitive personal information. When pressed by 404 Media on whether the CFPB’s rule change would address this, the CFPB said it was in the early stages of the process, but that the sale of data to private investigators was a concern.</p><p>Mao said that if the CFPB does change the rules so credit header data is part of a consumer report, and therefore bound by the FCRA which regulates reports, “it would significantly restrict the sale of credit header data.” However, “it could be a strong regulation or it could be a very narrow regulation that still allows the sale of credit header data.” The “announcement essentially states that the agency <em>intends</em> to address the sale of the credit header data. While that's great news, we do not know the substance of what they will propose, though we hope it will really address the problem,” Mao said. </p><p>As part of its proposed rules, the CFPB is now asking small businesses to contact the agency and provide feedback. The entire process could still take a long time. Laura Rivera, policy counsel at Just Futures Law, believes the CFPB already has the power to combat the sale of credit header data. “We want the agency to act now, and not wait for a lengthy regulatory process to close the credit header data loophole,” she said.</p><p>Jordan Takeyama, senior public relations manager at Experian, said “we thoroughly vet all clients and partners, and contractually require them to maintain high levels of commitment to the responsible use and security of data and uphold laws.” </p><p>Equifax did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p><p>“It is now clear that data brokers pose both a threat to U.S. national security and to Americans' safety and privacy,” Senator Wyden’s statement added. “These unaccountable companies have recklessly sold Americans' information to agents working for foreign governments and have enabled hackers to access and sell Americans' personal information to anyone with a credit card.”</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html-->

<p>If the lawyers have their way, the history of the Internet could disappear. It's time for someone to do something about it.</p><p>The World Wide Web, the thing you use every day for information, entertainment, and utility is arguably roughly 40 years old. Prior to 1993/94, there was no easy way to view and access the Internet's voluminous, often university-and-academia-based information. The first web browsers and then the explosion in the use of Netscape, Spyglass, and Internet Explorers not only opened up the existing libraries but promoted the creation of millions of new information sources, followed quickly by entertainment, news, and shopping.</p><p>Throughout most of that history, the non-profit <a href="https://archive.org/" target="_blank" data-url="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> has been there, first capturing the web itself and ultimately packaging it as the <a href="https://archive.org/web/" target="_blank" data-url="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a> and soon sucking in all kinds of digital content, acting as a sentinel for our binary thoughts and experiences.</p><p>It's like the fully digital counterpart to the <a href="https://loc.gov/" target="_blank" data-url="https://loc.gov/">US Government's Library of Congress</a> which has spent much of its history archiving physical content in the form of books, music, movies, and artifacts.</p><p>The two often work together, and the Internet Archive also gets funding support from the government, but only one of them is being sued on two fronts by lawyers from <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/internet-archive-is-liable-for-copyright-infringement-court-rules-230325/" target="_blank" data-url="https://torrentfreak.com/internet-archive-is-liable-for-copyright-infringement-court-rules-230325/">major book publishers</a> and <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/record-labels-hit-internet-archive-with-new-400m-copyright-lawsuit-230812/" target="_blank" data-url="https://torrentfreak.com/record-labels-hit-internet-archive-with-new-400m-copyright-lawsuit-230812/">the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America)</a> who insist the Internet Archive is nothing more than a mass copyright infringer.</p><h2 id="infringement-versus-preservation-and-access-3">Infringement versus preservation and access</h2><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" alt="Internet Archive" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp;

But by making these bits of content searchable and fully available to the public, the content owners insist the Internet Archive is, as one lawsuit puts it, exploiting "sound recordings without authorization, neither Plaintiffs nor their artists see a dime. Not only does this harm Plaintiffs and the artists or their heirs by depriving them of compensation, but it undermines the value of music.”</p><p>The Internet Archive often argues fair use and, in the case of physical books that it makes available, it imposes lending limits that sound no different than a physical library.</p><p>I understand protecting authors and music artists from infringement and loss of funds, though the content the Internet Archive offers is typically not, for instance, the current top 50 in music or on The New York Times' current Best Sellers list. In the case of the RIAA's most recent suit, it relates to music by mostly dead musicians and that was originally distributed on 78rpm albums.</p><p>The Internet Archive stands a fair chance of losing these and probably other legal battles. On the face of it, yes, the IA is probably infringing, even if it makes no money from the library and is only seeking to ensure access to those who don't, say, have libraries or access to these books and to ensure the preservation and access to music that won't typically be played on your radio or be easily findable on your favorite streaming services. But by sharing this often hard-to-find content, it also serves as a leveler of playing fields. Should only those who can afford to pay be able to read classic works and hear old but iconic music?</p><h2 id="a-dark-path-3">A dark path</h2><p>What happens, I wonder, when the Internet Archive loses these cases and is forced to remove the content and possibly pay damages? Certainly, the success in one case has led to the other and will surely lead to more. Soon every Intellectual Property holder will be going after the Internet Archive and soon it will succumb and disappear.</p><p>That's my fear and it should be yours, too.</p><p>You may not have noticed that those who create much of the online content you read are always precious about preserving it. In fact, in some instances, media companies will purposely purge old content in an effort to help them rise in search results. Basically game the Google system.</p><p>Imagine someone walking into a library and arbitrarily choosing whole shelves to discard because it assumed they were no longer relevant. This happens every day online.</p><p>Google doesn't care. It will surface what's relevant and is happiest when people follow its ever-changing SEO rules. The depth of your archives is less important than how you craft content to elevate it on the search results page.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, Google cares little about the history of the Internet. A few years ago, you could find deleted web pages by clicking on Google's cached version of that page. Google did away with that feature and now if a page is gone on someone's server, it's also permanently gone on Google.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" alt="Wayback Machine" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-320-80.png.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-480-80.png.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-650-80.png.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-970-80.png.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-1024-80.png.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-1200-80.png.webp 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N.png" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N.png"><source type="image/png" alt="Wayback Machine" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-320-80.png 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-480-80.png 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-650-80.png 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-970-80.png 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-1024-80.png 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-1200-80.png 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N.png" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N.png"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N.png" alt="Wayback Machine" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/techradar/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-320-80.png 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-480-80.png 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-650-80.png 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-970-80.png 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-1024-80.png 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-1200-80.png 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N.png" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N.png" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-320-80.png 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-480-80.png 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-650-80.png 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-970-80.png 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-1024-80.png 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDGMAXcF5kUbhhtqgNns5N-1200-80.png 1200w"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span>You'll find the history of the Internet here. </span><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="going-way-back-3">Going way back</h2><p>The Internet Archive, though, is the one place that's preserving the past, and that can give us a clear image of the Internet as it was and the stories we wrote. It is a historical record. Much of it is preserved in the aforementioned Wayback Machine. You can put in any domain (living or dead) and then cruise through thousands of live-ish web pages going back to the mid-1990s. The Wayback Machine didn't capture every page, every hour, every day. Instead, it has snapshots, but it's something and more than enough when archives of early versions of CNN, PCMag.com, sites like Suck, and, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/9/23826342/cnet-content-pruning-deleting-articles-google-seo" data-url="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/9/23826342/cnet-content-pruning-deleting-articles-google-seo">more recently some of CNet</a>, have been wiped off the Internet.</p><p>That history is now at risk.</p><p>My thinking is that frequent partner The Library of Congress can put a stop to this by buying the Internet Archive. Make it a government body and protect all that digital content. I think these lawyers may be less inclined to sue the US Federal government.</p><p>The LOC already preserves Tweets (at least it did, I have no idea what it's doing about Xes) because of their historical significance. Are websites and how we wrote and talked online about the world around us any less important? Clearly, the Internet Archive's other work with books, music, photos, and Web videos dovetails neatly with the Library of Congress' core objectives. Acquiring the Internet Archive and saving it all just makes sense.</p><p>This needs to happen now before the Internet Archive loses these suits and it's just too late.</p>

  <p id="H92OMX">Meditation has taken two divergent paths through the Western mind. For many, it’s a few quick, calming breaths, perhaps timed with a smartphone app, in search of a stress tonic that can soften anxiety’s edges. Along a less-traveled route, meditation remains what it long was: a deeply transformative pursuit, a devoted metamorphosis of the mind toward increasingly enlightened states.</p>
<p id="kpI2fv">But this bifurcated view of meditation as a relaxing practice for the masses and a life-changing practice for the committed few is deeply misleading. A spectrum runs between them, harboring experiences that are far more interesting and powerful than what the growing <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/3/29/18264703/mindfulness-meditation-buddhism-david-forbes">mindfulness industry</a> advertises, and more accessible to average people than what tropes of arcane states like enlightenment suggest. </p>
<p id="mjxRT2">Given that wealthy countries like the US aren’t exactly riding trend lines toward new peaks of mental health (depression rates in American adults <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/505745/depression-rates-reach-new-highs.aspx">are at an all-time high</a>, while young people appear in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/23013483/mental-health-pandemic-young-people-sapien-labs">grips of a mental health crisis</a>), scalable ways of not just mindfully soothing, but completely re-creating psychological experiences for the better should set off sirens of general, scientific, and funding intrigue.</p>
<p id="fOseJ1">For the past two decades, the growing science of meditation has roughly followed the same split that ignores this middle path. Most research studies basic mindfulness as a health intervention in novice meditators, where modestly positive results have led to comparisons like <a href="https://www.mindful.org/meditation-mental-fitness-way/">exercise for the mind</a>, or <a href="https://www.vox.com/podcasts/2019/5/30/18644106/richard-davidson-ezra-klein-show">mental flossing</a>. On the other end, researchers will occasionally strap EEG electrodes to the scalp of Tibetan monks, offering a glimpse inside the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34974617/">unusual brain activity</a> of an advanced meditator. </p>
<p id="y43qpM">A new band of researchers, however, is finding that you don’t need 10,000 hours in a monastery before meditation can upend your entire psychology — and yet, the current body of meditation research has had <a href="https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/hey-why-arent-we-doing-more-research?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=78415&amp;post_id=114835500&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;utm_medium=email">surprisingly little to say about this middle ground</a> between stress relief and enlightenment. </p>
<p id="7lzYoP">As the number of meditating Americans has <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/8/18073422/yoga-meditation-apps-health-anxiety-cdc">more than tripled</a> in recent years, an onslaught of apps, books, and seminars helped mold the public image of meditation around the simpler and more sellable idea of mindfulness as a form of stress reduction. That image is paying off: The broader mindfulness industry was valued at $97.6 million in 2021 and is <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/mindfulness-meditation-application-market-A31649#:~:text=The%20global%20mindfulness%20meditation%20application,12.4%25%20from%202022%20to%202031.">projected to triple in value</a> by 2031. Critics call it “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/600158/mcmindfulness-by-ronald-purser/">McMindfulness</a>,” a capitalist perversion of meditation that deals with stress by focusing inward on the breath, rather than outward on the social structures that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/20/opinion/us-mental-health-politics.html">cause so much of that stress</a>. Regardless of how you package it, “mindfulness programs only scratch the surface of meditation,” <a href="https://brain.harvard.edu/?people=matthew-d-sacchet">Matthew Sacchet</a>, a neuroscientist, professor of psychiatry, and director of Harvard’s <a href="https://meditation.mgh.harvard.edu/index.html">Meditation Research Program</a>, told me. </p>
<p id="BmFfxX">Sacchet is part of a recent turn in meditation research that is putting the fuller, stranger range of meditative experiences under the scrutiny of laboratory conditions. Rather than evaluating meditation in the same way that we do therapy or drug trials, new theories from cognitive science (like <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13164-022-00666-6">predictive processing</a>) along with new tools — such as machine learning models that read more deeply into neural activity than humans can alone — are shifting the science of meditation in the direction of grasping after the nature of the mind and the ways we might transform it for the better. </p>
<p id="cfOgWo">“There was this initial focus on meditation as attention and emotional regulation practices,” said <a href="https://rubenlaukkonen.com/">Ruben Laukkonen</a>, an assistant professor at Southern Cross University. “But over time, there’s been a recognition that in contemplative traditions, that’s not really the goal. These are side effects. When you talk to people who really take this stuff seriously, you find that there’s these layers of experience that unfold that are much deeper.”</p>
<p id="PtrtLm"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2021/jun/29/hacking-enlightenment-can-ultrasound-help-you-transcend-reality">Research labs</a> and <a href="https://www.jhourney.io/">private companies</a> are already developing technologies they hope can democratize access to meditation’s deep-end experiences. From <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/6/24/23770659/psychedelic-science-conference-drugs-mental-health-legislation-mdma-ketamine-psilocybin-mushrooms">psychedelics</a> to brain stimulation, the hunt is on for ways to cut the time it usually takes to begin experiencing more profound effects. “Ultimately, our mission is to understand advanced meditation to scale advanced meditation, and we believe that this will have profound impact on individual well-being and the collective health of society,” said Sacchet.</p>
<p id="OsxhqT">Scaling access to the benefits of advanced meditation could offer something a little stronger (or a lot stronger, depending on how the tech fares) to the more than 100 million users who turn to mindfulness apps like Calm or Headspace in search of a psychological balm. In a world hell-bent on hacks for everything from emails to nutrition, <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/consciousness-hacking-silicon-valley-enlightenment-brain">why not consciousness</a>, too? If deeper states of meditation can go beyond calming the mind and transform its fundamental habits in ways that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-023-02101-y#Sec6">dissolve stress and raise well-being</a>, then making the process faster and more user-friendly could pay major dividends. </p>
<p id="3Ez5oD">But concerns abound. Even if profoundly altered states of consciousness are amenable to hacking (an unsettled debate), there’s hardly any evidence that today’s generation of tools is up to the task. Worse, if it is, what if accelerating the process of pulling up and shifting around the roots of consciousness just short-circuits millions of minds? And yet, without serious shortcuts, how many people will realistically devote a meaningful chunk of their daily lives to sitting quietly, doing nothing?</p>
<p id="gp9C3P">On one hand, the Western study of consciousness has <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/6/30/23778870/consciousness-brain-mind-hard-problem-neuroscience-koch-chalmers">been hamstrung since Galileo</a> cleaved sensory experience from the scientific method, and I can think of few things more worthy of deep research. Just as studying the extremes of particle physics (say, smashing atoms of gold together to create temperatures in excess of <a href="https://bigthink.com/hard-science/quark-gluon-plasma/">7.2 trillion degrees Fahrenheit</a>) can reveal generalizable principles about all matter, the extremes of conscious experience are probably a good place to look for a better understanding of all minds. We have a lot more to learn about how to raise well-being, which, at its core, is a property of consciousness.</p>
<p id="Y5DrA1">As far as defiling ancient practices with shiny new technologies or the perils of swapping gurus for algorithms, these are the fascinating, messy, indeed dangerous, and perhaps extraordinarily wonderful examples of how the dharma — the Buddha’s teachings — is adapting to a new environment. We should support this process as wisely as we can, not turn away. And how could we? The future of our minds may depend on it.</p>
<h3 id="dDT3b9">How mindfulness defined the first wave of contemplative studies</h3>
<p id="bsVg7i">What we now call <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01788/full">contemplative science</a> is the interdisciplinary study of how practices like meditation, prayer, and psychedelic use affect the mind, brain, and body. Its American roots go back to at least the 1960s, when the inflow of Buddhist ideas enchanted a generation of, as the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49303/howl">put it</a>, “angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night.” But it wasn’t just poets and hipsters; the likes of scientists and lawyers also started meditating.  </p>
<p id="scYAQJ">Back then, there were no mindfulness apps or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-is-installing-tiny-amazen-booths-help-employees-mental-health-2021-5">corporate “Zen booths”</a> offering meditation as a reprieve to stressed-out workers. The point of meditation, as taught by transplanted Asian teachers of the time like Japan’s D. T. Suzuki and Tibet’s Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, was a deep transformation of consciousness — the full force of awakening. Suzuki <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/175544/zen-buddhism-by-selected-writings-of-dt-suzuki-edited-by-william-barrett/9780385483490/excerpt">described Zen</a>, which derives from the Sanskrit word for meditation, as “the art of seeing into the nature of one’s own being ... it points the way from bondage to freedom.” </p>
<p id="aBIF0Y">The idea of meditation as a means of awakening flared up and then began fading out <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/long-reads/optimism-hippies-sixties-history-hollywood-zen-a9156511.html">along with the counterculture</a> itself. The hippies’ rejection of the soulless, sexless mainstream failed to build an alternative that could last, leaving their gusto for higher levels of consciousness adrift, sailing out to the cultural fringes. In the light of modern science, the quest for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-04474-1">higher vibrations</a> has come to appear essentially unserious — a New Age trope. But one of those scientists-turned-meditators, Jon Kabat-Zinn, had a vision for how to bring it back into the mainstream.</p>

<p id="rr0sGX">The son of a biomedical scientist and a painter, Kabat-Zinn earned a PhD in molecular biology in 1971. Having already established a daily meditation practice in 1966, he spent his early years at the University of Massachusetts Medical School stewing over what his “karmic assignment,” or life’s work, should be. Then, during a two-week meditation retreat in the woods <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/22/mindfulness-jon-kabat-zinn-depression-trump-grenfell">west of Boston</a>, he saw it in a 10-second vision, “an instantaneous seeing of vivid, almost inevitable connections and their implications,” as he put it. Simply: “Why not make meditation so commonsensical that anyone would be drawn to it?” </p>
<p id="hIgw3n">Shortly after, in 1979, he founded the <a href="https://www.ummhealth.org/center-mindfulness">Stress Reduction Clinic</a> at the medical school, which eventually became the eight-week course known as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), and served as the format for the mindfulness boom to come. In this interpretation, mindfulness is <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1093%2Fclipsy.bpg016">a simple instruction</a>: pay attention to the present moment, on purpose, without judgment. Secular and testable, MBSR offered a form of meditation fit for accountants and clinical trials, rather than hippies and communes.  </p>
<p id="Jufs1T">Kabat-Zinn authored <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/bf00845519">a few studies</a> on MBSR in the 1980s, but it wasn’t until the early 2000s that mindfulness research really took off. At the 2005 Society for Neuroscience annual meeting, the Dalai Lama <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2005/11/13/dalai-lama-talks-to-scientists/8672035b-ec76-4f11-89d8-546d23b8afcf/">told a crowd of 14,000 conference participants</a> (some of whom <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jul/27/research.highereducation">were upset</a> by the presence of a religious leader at a scientific affair — one online petition to withdraw his invitation received nearly 800 signatures) that Buddhism and cognitive science share deep similarities. “I believe a close cooperation between these two investigative traditions can truly contribute toward expanding the human understanding of the complex world of inner subjective experience that we call the mind,” <a href="https://www.dalailama.com/messages/buddhism/science-at-the-crossroads">he said</a>. </p>
<p id="GiqtlY">Shortly after, scientists picked up on the already existing construct of MBSR, publications on mindfulness began erupting, and the field of contemplative science sprang to life. </p>

<p id="1WhWLL">“For 20 years, there were a lot of single-arm trials [without controls like placebo groups or randomization] showing MBSR, in its various forms, can actually help improve health outcomes,” said <a href="https://roundglass.com/people/David_Vago7n1k0lef/">David Vago</a>, a founding neuroscientist at the International Society for Contemplative Research.</p>
<p id="9swlUZ">Now, as the research matures into controlled studies and meta-analyses, meditation is losing a bit of its luster. It’s beginning to look more like just another decently effective medical intervention. A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691620968771#body-ref-bibr57-1745691620968771">2021 systematic review of 44 meta-analyses</a> found that mindfulness was mostly on par with cognitive behavioral therapy or antidepressants in terms of treatment effects (mindfulness was superior in a few categories, however, including treating depression and substance abuse).</p>
<p id="9piRxC">That’s still good news, but it’s hard to see how something that works about as well as Prozac or a therapist offers the “seeds of a necessary global renaissance in the making,” as Kabat-Zinn <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X19300211?via%3Dihub">has written</a>, let alone the end of suffering, as the Buddha taught.</p>
<p id="j3yvsE">“So we’re left with this big question,” Vago said. “Is the goal of meditation to reduce our perceived stress or symptoms of anxiety? Are those the true goals of the practice? I would say not. But that’s how the medical model has been used to test the efficacy of meditation.”</p>
<p id="WPTlrq">Everyone I spoke to agreed that there’s more to meditation than just another somewhat effective health intervention. But discovering what more, exactly, will require a different set of questions and tools than what delivered the current generation of mindfulness research. And the past few years have seen a proliferation of precisely that.</p>
<h3 id="aZVyAD">The next generation of contemplative science is here</h3>
<p id="40IlmA">Just as the mindfulness era began with the establishment of a university center, a contemplative science focused on psychological transformation is growing its own institutions.</p>
<p id="XH3MYp">Sacchet is <a href="https://catalyst.harvard.edu/news/article/the-next-frontier-of-meditation-science/">expanding the Meditation Research Program</a> into a larger operation — the Center for the Science of Meditation — that aims to conduct gold-standard research on the deep end of meditation experiences. “These types of experiences are often described as transformative,” Sacchet explained, “that is, as laying the foundations for new ways of being, which may include updated understandings of meaning in life, and increased capacities for joy, happiness, and general well-being.” </p>
<p id="jQFbD1">Laukkonen, who focuses on the cognitive neuroscience of meditation, said that ”we have new theoretical frameworks that can capture contemplative effects. That’s a huge shift because it’s really hard to appreciate states that don’t fit into your theoretical paradigm.” Adding to the new theories are new scientific tools and gizmos. “The analytical techniques are getting more sophisticated, which allows you to ask questions that you couldn’t ask before. All these things feed into each other.”</p>
<p id="DQRZPp">He described how ongoing research is using machine learning models to decode and measure meditative “depth” or the “expertise” of one’s practice, opening a new frontier of understanding. Rather than simply studying the outcomes of mindfulness practice, they’re peering into the real-time processes. </p>
<p id="4lMoyQ"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014976342100261X">In a 2021 paper</a>, Laukkonen and his colleague Heleen Slagter suggested that one way to think about the depth of meditation is the degree to which the mind is engaged in abstractions or conceptual thought. They <a href="https://www.musingmind.org/podcasts/ruben-laukkonen">describe meditation</a> as a process of deconstructing engrained habits of mind “until all conceptual processing falls away, unveiling a state of <a href="https://www.philosophie.fb05.uni-mainz.de/files/2020/03/Metzinger_MPE1_PMS_2020.pdf">pure awareness</a>.” </p>
<p id="DCdRXx">On that basis, by training machine learning models on brain activity across a variety of tasks that involve conceptual thinking, Laukkonen hypothesizes that we could teach the algorithms to recognize the neural signatures of conceptual thought in general. Then, we could use those models to measure the degree of conceptual thought present in any brain state, such as during meditation. The rough idea is: the less conceptual thinking (or abstraction), the deeper the meditation. “That’s where the field is moving toward, trying to identify mechanisms or biomarkers for change and progress. We’re starting to map that out,” Vago said. </p>

<p id="KpsPd5">Alongside new theories and technologies, ancient claims of unbelievable meditative states are being <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612322001984?dgcid=author#t0010">observed under the scrutiny of scientists</a> in controlled settings for the first time. A few thousand years ago, the Mahāvedalla Sutta (a scripture of Theravada Buddhism) described one such state that advanced meditators could enter at will — nirodha samāpatti, or cessation attainment<em>. </em>Think of cessation, also <a href="https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/PathofPurification2011.pdf">scripturally described</a> as the “non-occurrence of consciousness,” like voluntarily inducing the effects of general anesthesia. Consciousness switches off without a trace, while the basic homeostatic operations of the body — temperature, heartbeat, breathing — remain online. </p>
<p id="5lPsfQ">The scripture <a href="https://www.themindingcentre.org/dharmafarer/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/30.2-Mahavedalla-S-m43-piya.pdf">says</a> meditators can predetermine a length of time to “go under” merely by setting an intended duration, like an internally fashioned alarm clock. That duration is said to be able to stretch up to seven days, provided their body can last that long. After setting the intention, they settle into meditation, and the light of consciousness switches off. When it returns, meditators were said to emerge crisp and refreshed, with elevated senses of clarity and vitality (decidedly unlike the woozy return from anesthesia).</p>
<p id="vbXOmk">Laukkonen, Sacchet, and their colleagues met someone who claimed they could enter cessation on command and was willing to do so in a lab. While they’re still processing the data, a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612322001984?dgcid=author">preliminary publication of their findings</a> suggests nirodha samāpatti<em> — </em>at least for 90-minute stretches — may not be as outlandish as it sounds.</p>
<p id="8j9ZoU">In a recent but separate pilot study conducted by Sacchet, he found that right before an advanced meditator has micro-cessations — referred to in the ancient texts as “nirodha<em>”</em> without the samāpatti<em> —</em> the alpha band of brain activity (the major rhythm of brain activity in typical, waking adults) begins winding down. It’s at its lowest immediately following the nirodha, which only lasts maybe a second or two. Then alpha activity begins climbing again, returning to normal levels in less than a minute.</p>
<p id="B6QH0P">The preliminary data on the full nirodha samāpatti <a href="https://twitter.com/RubenLaukkonen/status/1651033000283611136?s=20">found the same pattern</a>. Leading up to cessation, alpha activity began dropping. It bottomed out during cessation and rose again afterward. While these patterns aren’t enough to confirm the full account of cessation, they do look like a plausible neural correlate for temporarily extinguishing consciousness. </p>
<p id="yp3Xih">Being able to train one’s mind to manually switch off consciousness for some predetermined period does not weave seamlessly into conventional understandings of human psychology. Maybe, like bears, there is some <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003552120300832">evolutionary value in short periods of mental hibernation</a>. Or maybe, buried in the deeper folds of consciousness, there are capabilities unrelated to survival that can help improve well-being anyway.</p>
<p id="naJEE6">If the ordinary egoic sense of consciousness evolved for environments where a constant hum of fight or flight mentality helped keep us alive, advanced meditation may offer a way of reprogramming some of these inherited tendencies that no longer serve us in our comparatively new evolutionary environments, like discarding clothes that no longer fit. The <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23721486/ketamine-dmt-lsd-psychedelics-magic-mushrooms-legalization-recreation-psilocybin">same goes for psychedelics</a>. </p>
<h3 id="OfMZKb">Advanced meditation for everyone?</h3>
<p id="Kylzyu">“My hope is that ultimately, this work will contribute to bringing advanced meditation out of the monastery,” Sacchet said, describing its “incredible promise for moving beyond addressing mental health issues, toward helping people thrive.”</p>
<p id="T2Kn5H">To do that, meditation probably needs to reach more than a sliver of humanity, which could be a problem: Many people do not like to meditate. One <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/people-would-rather-be-electrically-shocked-left-alone-their-thoughts">infamous study</a> found that many participants would rather administer electric shocks to themselves than sit quietly doing nothing for 15 minutes. And 15 minutes is on the low end of meditation periods, even for basic mindfulness. Although unusual states can arise at any point in one’s practice, it’s common for those endeavoring toward the deep end to spend an hour a day or more in meditation. Some devote entire lifetimes. Multiple, even, if you’re into reincarnation. Who’s got time for that?</p>
<p id="SYLKkJ">But if American culture is obsessed with anything, it’s optimization. Can we get the same or more outputs from fewer inputs? Can we automate any part of the process? Research labs and venture capitalists alike are already exploring whether the more transformative fruits of contemplative practice may be had quicker, easier, and more efficiently than through decades of patient meditation. </p>
<p id="b35Wwq">One label for this optimization effort is “<a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250274946/spirittech">spirit tech</a>,” a mixed bag consisting mainly of brain stimulation, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22727109/enlightenment-technology-neurofeedback-brain-stimulation-psychedelics">neurofeedback</a>, and psychedelics. This isn’t new, precisely — mantras, monasteries, and robes are forms of spirit tech that have been used for generations. But today’s emerging options seem closer than ever to making a meaningful dent in the barriers that have kept the masses from experiencing advanced meditative states for themselves. </p>

Now, they’re exploring whether <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/sonication">sonicating</a> — the fun word for targeting ultrasound waves — a brain into <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-015-0358-3">configurations known to correlate</a> with deeper states of meditation can accelerate the process. </p>
<p id="gOzVXl">Standing at the precipice of democratizing access to sudden bursts of deep meditation experiences is exciting. The less glamorous risks that might come with a shortcut to the depths of contemplative practice, not as much. While very rare, these can range from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34074221/">anxiety spikes</a> to <a href="https://www.esquire.com/uk/latest-news/a25651175/the-other-side-of-paradise-how-i-left-a-buddhist-retreat-in-handcuffs/">psychotic breaks</a>. Young <a href="http://shinzenyoung.blogspot.com/2011_11_01_archive.html">told</a> a meditation student about “falling into the Pit of the Void,” one of the ways Buddhist tradition describes how intense experiences can go wrong. Until the professor of psychiatry <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/wbritton">Willoughby Britton’s</a> research on adverse meditation experiences, or “dark nights of the soul” (later rebranded as the <a href="https://www.cheetahhouse.org/vce">varieties of contemplative experience study</a>), there was little clinical support for those suffering from negative meditation experiences.</p>
<p id="YMUYUF">Even now, Daniel Ingram, a former emergency room physician and author of <a href="https://www.mctb.org/"><em>Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha</em></a>, cautioned, “there’s basically a long, slow trainwreck happening between people getting into these experiences and the clinical mainstream just not understanding them.” </p>
<p id="zSJU78">Notably, <a href="https://aeon.co/videos/meditation-without-meditating-might-be-possible-can-it-also-be-made-ethical">in a promotional video for their research</a>, Young narrates: “If you’ll pardon my French, we are scared shitless of this technology.” And yet, <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23621198/artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-openai-existential-risk-china-ai-safety-technology">as in the world of AI</a>, they’re building it anyway. The hope is that they’re able to do so in a more prudent manner than others — profit-seeking companies, especially — who are eager to rush their brain-zapping technology to market before carefully assessing the risks.</p>
<p id="Wpde4k">Vago told me that support systems help to navigate these experiences. Once you zap — or sonicate — someone into a brain state associated with deep-end meditation, enlightenment doesn’t simply lock into place. He said that “psychedelics and brain stimulation technology will get us there fast, but you have to know what to do with it. If you don’t have the proper setup, and you didn’t do any meditation to stabilize the mind, you could have adverse effects that leave you feeling dissociated and lonely. It takes scaffolding.”</p>
<p id="To2UjL">There are also questions of efficacy. Even if you can quickly techno-boost someone into a sudden burst of enlightenment-like states, are they really experiencing the same thing as someone who patiently meditated for years to get there? Should meditators seek to enter some predefined brain state by any means possible, or does the path you take make a difference?</p>
<p id="ygaM51">“If you get people into these states, then you give them the impression that that is the goal state. Then they come into their meditation practice with a complete misunderstanding of what the purpose is according to any of the classical instructions, and they spend their meditation trying to get into a state, which prevents all of the interesting and useful transformations from happening. So it’s a paradox,” as Laukkonen put it.</p>
<p id="ypZwBR">In his view (held by many others I spoke with), contemplative traditions do not describe meditation as a practice for getting into funky states of mind; these are side effects. Instead, meditation is about deep transformations in the ordinary ways that consciousness operates, developing altered traits rather than merely altered states, as others in the field <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/533719/altered-traits-by-daniel-goleman-and-richard-j-davidson/">have put it</a>. Still, maybe certain altered states are more conducive to finding and stabilizing altered traits than others.</p>
<p id="HPPemm">Contemplative traditions have embraced paradox as a central element of their teachings. Optimizing around a paradox, however, is tricky business. You might wind up reinforcing the very <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0079612307680182">construct of the self</a> that meditation aims to deconstruct. Laukkonen still approved of research into spirit tech from a basic scientific perspective. But, he added: “It’s really about freedom and liberation. And what is liberating about chasing different states of consciousness, and not enjoying the one that you have?”</p>
<h3 id="8UA4yP">Contemplative science needs scalable bureaucracy</h3>
<p id="A3IOh7">Whether the widening field of contemplative science will drum up an American desire for freedom and liberation, who knows? “What people want,” said Ingram, “is a long, happy, good life most of the time. The problem is that we don’t actually know what leads to that.” We’ve done large, <a href="https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/">multigenerational studies on heart disease</a>, and deep, epidemiological inquiries into <a href="https://nutritionstudies.org/the-china-study/">diet and nutrition</a>. But major spiritual experiences that leave people forever transformed, that pull up suffering from its roots in deep psychological habits? We don’t have much peer-reviewed research on those.</p>
<p id="5PGbWJ">As contemplative scientists are now diving in, Ingram hopes that public health officials will follow. Alongside deeper scientific knowledge that could help scale interest in advanced meditation, supporting those already having these experiences requires better clinical support. Ingram, Sacchet, and Vago are all members of the <a href="https://theeprc.org/">Emergent Phenomenology Research Consortium (EPRC)</a>, a network of scholars and practitioners aiming to foster deeper dialogue between clinical care, public health, and the deep end of human experience. Their vision is deeply bureaucratic, that unholy road into the heart of modern institutions. They want new diagnostic codes, updated medical textbooks, more informed public health guidelines, and insurance reimbursement procedures. </p>
<p id="2BA2W8">More broadly, Ingram emphasized that spreading the knowledge contemplative scientists may glean from studying advanced meditation will require better packaging. We have ideas like biological taxonomies and genetics that provide a shared basis for cross-cultural understanding and exploration of universally relevant fields. “We need that for the deep end of spiritual experience,” he said. “What works as well in Riyadh, as Rome, as Rio, as rural Alabama? What’s the functional, scalable essence?”</p>
<p id="A4Efur">It’s possible that what matters most in the murky terrain of advanced meditation will forever elude scientific measurement, mass uptake, and bureaucratic integration, at least to some degree. But the growing field of contemplative science is poking around to see where the boundaries may lie. As the best spiritual teachers all emphasize, rather than taking anyone’s word for it, we should find out for ourselves.</p>

      Most news outlets make their money through advertising or subscriptions. But when it comes to what we’re trying to do at Vox, there are a couple of big issues with relying on ads and subscriptions to keep the lights on.<br>
First, advertising dollars go up and down with the economy, which makes it hard to plan ahead. Second, we’re not in the subscriptions business. Vox is here to help everyone understand the complex issues shaping the world — not just the people who can afford to pay for a subscription. <br>
It’s important that we have several ways we make money. That’s why, even though advertising is still our biggest source of revenue, we also seek reader support. <br>

Th<!-- -->e agreement would let agencies examine TikTok’s US facilities, records, and servers with minimal prior notice and veto the hiring of any executive involved with leading TikTok US data security organization. It would also let US agencies block changes to the app’s terms of service in the US and order the company to subject itself to various audits, all on TikTok’s dime, per Forbes.<!-- --> In extreme cases, the agreement would allow government organizations to demand TikTok temporarily shut off functioning in the US.</p><p>CFIUS did not immediately respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment.

We are doing more than any peer company to safeguard U.S. national security interests.”</p><p>The draft document, which Gizmodo could not independently verify, is reportedly around 100 pages long and contains comments sent between attorneys representing ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese-owned parent company,<!-- --> and CFIUS. <!-- -->The agreements, if accepted as written at the time, would open TikTok’s US operations up to supervision by a number of external third-party auditors and source code inspectors.

In several instances, according to Forbes, TikTok’s<!-- --> attorneys pushed back against terms that would let the <!-- -->government alter what types of user data ByteDance employees could view.

A public preview of the feature is available today, allowing Excel users to manipulate and analyze data from Python.</p><p>“You can manipulate and explore data in Excel using Python plots and libraries, and then use Excel’s formulas, charts and PivotTables to further refine your insights,” <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/introducing-python-in-excel-the-best-of-both-worlds-for-data/ba-p/3905482">explains Stefan Kinnestrand</a>, general manager of modern work at Microsoft. “Now you can do advanced data analysis in the familiar Excel environment by accessing Python directly from the Excel ribbon.”</p><p>You won’t need to install any additional software or set up an add-on to access the functionality, as Python integration in Excel will be part of Excel’s built-in connectors and Power Query. Microsoft is also adding a new PY function that allows Python data to be exposed within the grid of an Excel spreadsheet. Through a partnership with Anaconda, an enterprise Python repository, popular Python libraries like pandas, statsmodels, and Matplotlib will be available in Excel.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Python inside a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1440/376x212/filters:focal(1280x720:1281x721):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24865498/YTYBRed.jpeg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1440/384x216/filters:focal(1280x720:1281x721):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24865498/YTYBRed.jpeg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1440/415x233/filters:focal(1280x720:1281x721):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24865498/YTYBRed.jpeg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1440/480x270/filters:focal(1280x720:1281x721):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24865498/YTYBRed.jpeg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1440/540x304/filters:focal(1280x720:1281x721):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24865498/YTYBRed.jpeg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1440/640x360/filters:focal(1280x720:1281x721):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24865498/YTYBRed.jpeg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1440/750x422/filters:focal(1280x720:1281x721):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24865498/YTYBRed.jpeg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1440/828x466/filters:focal(1280x720:1281x721):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24865498/YTYBRed.jpeg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1440/1080x608/filters:focal(1280x720:1281x721):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24865498/YTYBRed.jpeg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1440/1200x675/filters:focal(1280x720:1281x721):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24865498/YTYBRed.jpeg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1440/1440x810/filters:focal(1280x720:1281x721):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24865498/YTYBRed.jpeg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1440/1920x1080/filters:focal(1280x720:1281x721):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24865498/YTYBRed.jpeg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1440/2048x1152/filters:focal(1280x720:1281x721):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24865498/YTYBRed.jpeg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1440/2400x1350/filters:focal(1280x720:1281x721):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24865498/YTYBRed.jpeg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2560x1440/2400x1350/filters:focal(1280x720:1281x721):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24865498/YTYBRed.jpeg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>Python inside a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div></div><p>Python calculations run in the Microsoft Cloud, with the results returned into an Excel worksheet.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

						<p>I recently switched from Google Chrome to Mozilla Firefox as my main desktop browser. Here’s what I&nbsp;did to improve upon Firefox’ sometimes not ideal defaults.<span id="more-676"></span></p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons why I considered the switch from Chrome to Firefox: A growing uneasy feeling about Google’s approach to user privacy, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/chrome-delays-plan-to-limit-ad-blockers-new-timeline-coming-in-march/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manifest v3</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/googles-web-integrity-api-sounds-like-drm-for-the-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Googles’s WebDRM</a> plans, their <a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/free-software-group-decries-google-dropping-space-saving-jpeg-xl-format/" rel="noopener">rejection of JPEG XL</a> and the omnipresence of Chromium-based browsers nowadays – Chrome, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, Opera and some others are basically the same programs in different clothes.</p>
<p>Having used Firefox on Android for some time now, I knew Firefox Desktop is in a really good state and even <a target="_blank" href="https://www.howtogeek.com/firefox-is-closing-the-performance-gap-with-chrome/" rel="noopener">faster than Chrome in some benchmarks</a>. I decided to take that leap and switch to Firefox on my desktop devices. So far it’s been… good. The browser indeed feels a bit snappier than Chrome. It is light years ahead of the Firefox I stopped using 15 years ago.</p>
<p>There are some things that I miss in Firefox or that I find that Chrome does better. For future me and other people considering the switch, here are the problems I had and solutions or workarounds that I found.</p>
<h2>Problem 1: Browser Sync and Profile Switching</h2>
<p>I have used Chrome with a personal and a work profile, both of them tied to different Google accounts. Once logged in, Chrome syncs passwords, bookmarks, extensions etc. automatically across different PCs and my phone (except extensions). Both features, syncing and switching profiles, work reliably in Chrome.</p>
<p>Firefox has cross device syncing, too. It’s not that comfortable, but you only have to set it up on each device once. You can even self-host the sync-server, but as far as I know it is <a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34674569" rel="noopener">difficult to set up</a>, so I didn’t try that.</p>
<div id="attachment_719"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/firefox-profile-switcher.png?ssl=1"><img data-lazy-fallback="1" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-719" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/firefox-profile-switcher.png?resize=544%2C499&amp;ssl=1" alt="Screenshot: Firefox’ default profile manager" width="544" height="499" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/firefox-profile-switcher.png?resize=544%2C499&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-719">Firefox’ default profile manager is functional, but tbh quite inelegant. Maybe that is why they hid it behind a startup parameter.</p></div>
<p>Firefox’ built-in profile switcher is far worse than Chrome’s. To open it, you need to start Firefox with the <code>-p</code> parameter. Here’s how to add it to the taskbar in Windows:</p>
<p>Right-click on your Firefox Icon in the taskbar (or any other shortcut to Firefox in your system). → Right click on “Firefox”. → Choose “Properties” → In the “Target” field, add <code>-p</code> at the end (after the quotation marks).</p>
<div id="attachment_692"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/firefox-verknuepfung-eigenschaften.png?ssl=1"><img data-lazy-fallback="1" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-692" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/firefox-verknuepfung-eigenschaften.png?resize=414%2C543&amp;ssl=1" alt="File properties of the link to Firefox in Windows&nbsp;10’s taskbar. The -p parameter is added after the path to the EXE in the target field." width="414" height="543" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/firefox-verknuepfung-eigenschaften.png?resize=414%2C543&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-692">The link’s file properties dialog. It’s in German, but you get the drill: Append -p in the “target” field.</p></div>
<p>For switching to another account while the browser is running, I found the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/profile-switcher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Profile Switcher for Firefox”</a> extension that mimics the Profile switcher in Chrome’s menu bar. I highly recommend it!</p>
<p>Things to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to install an additional external helper application after activating the extension.</li>
<li>On Windows, you can install the helper app even on a PC without admin rights. It may trigger a virus alert, because it is unsigned. I checked the helper app against Virustotal, installed it and had no problems.</li>
<li>The extension initially did not work correctly when using virtual desktops on Windows&nbsp;10. To fix this, open Profile Switcher → Manage profiles → ⚙ (Gear Icon) → Activate “Window Focus workaround”</li>
<li>Unfortunately, Chrome’s <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;+ <kbd>Shift&nbsp;⇑</kbd>&nbsp;+ <kbd>M</kbd> shortcut for fast switching profiles does not work, as this is Firefox’ global shortcut for mobile view.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the last aspect, everything went smoothly. The Profile Switcher is a drastic QoL improvement if you need to handle different browser contexts.</p>
<h2>Problem&nbsp;2: Font Rendering</h2>
<p>Font rendering on Firefox right after install seemed “off” to me, compared to Chrome on my main system (Windows 10, 32″ 2560×1440 VA screen, 100% font scaling, ClearType enabled). Fonts are smaller on Firefox than on Chrome and single letters are narrower, so legibility is noticeably worse.</p>
<p>Some Screenshots: This is Vanilla Firefox.<br>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/firefox-vanilla-font-rendering.png?ssl=1"><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/firefox-vanilla-font-rendering.png?resize=600%2C300&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/firefox-vanilla-font-rendering.png?resize=600%2C300&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p>
<p>This is Chrome.<br>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chrome-font-rendering.png?ssl=1"><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chrome-font-rendering.png?resize=600%2C300&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chrome-font-rendering.png?resize=600%2C300&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p>
<p>This is Firefox with my optimized font rendering values (Don’t worry, we’ll get to that).<br>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/firefox-optimized-font-rendering.png?ssl=1"><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/firefox-optimized-font-rendering.png?resize=600%2C300&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/firefox-optimized-font-rendering.png?resize=600%2C300&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p>
<p>I&nbsp;scoured through the Internet and found that I was not the only person who did not like the default font rendering. To be entirely honest, I found it baffling how much worse Firefox’ defaults are in this quite important regard.</p>
<p>So I tried to improve on the defaults, I looked for tweaks online, and after many comparisons settled on the following:</p>
<p>Enter <code>about:config</code> in your address bar, confirm that you know what you’re doing. Search for the variables, double-click on them and change them to my values:</p>
<pre>gfx.<wbr>font_rendering.<wbr>cleartype_params.<wbr>force_gdi_classic_for_families = "" (delete the whole string)
gfx.<wbr>font_rendering.<wbr>cleartype_params.<wbr>enhanced_contrast = "100"
gfx.<wbr>font_rendering.<wbr>cleartype_params.<wbr>pixel_structure = "5"
gfx.<wbr>font_rendering.<wbr>cleartype_params.<wbr>rendering_mode = "5"
gfx.font_rendering.directwrite.bold_simulation = "2"
browser.<wbr>display.<wbr>auto_quality_min_font_size = "1"
gfx.<wbr>font_rendering.<wbr>cleartype_params.<wbr>gamma = "2"</pre>
<p>Note that the tweaks are <em>my personal preferences</em> on <em>my specific PC</em>. They are absolutely not universally applicable, may cause problems on some systems, are very dependent on your Monitor, OS, its font smoothing settings and even be subjectively worse. Also, they do not replicate Chrome’s font rendering perfectly. Text seems a bit bolder, which I actually like. Bright text on dark background still looks a bit worse, though. Feel free to comment if you know better tweaks values.</p>
<h2>Problem 3: Tabs</h2>
<p>Browsing habits are different. I am not a tab hoarder, I almost never have more than 15 of them open at the same time. I don’t need excessive tab management options, tab grouping or vertical tab bars – just my 3&nbsp;pinned ones (Mail, Calendar, Chat) and a good glimpse over the other open tabs.</p>

WTF, Mozilla?&nbsp;🫠</p></div>
<p>What boggled my mind was the fact that inactive tabs in Firefox have <em>no separators</em> between them. Tabs are just a long line of truncated text strings and some icons. Even weirder is the fact that Firefox <em>had</em> clear separation between inactive tabs in earlier version but <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1337885" rel="noopener" target="_blank">got rid of it in 2021</a>. Even worse, I could not find any themes, extensions, settings or about:config tweaks that made the tab bar “sane” in sort of a three click solution.</p>
<p>The new tab style is not my cup of tea and I can’t imagine that most people prefer it over Chrome (or earlier Firefox versions).</p>
<p>Truly a life saver was <a href="https://github.com/black7375/Firefox-UI-Fix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Firefox UI Fix script</a>. It re-activates Firefox’ former UI styles, Proton or Photon, which are both much better in terms of UI legibility.</p>

Mozilla should seriously consider making this the default.&nbsp;😏</p></div>
<p>I prefer the older Photon style but you should test both of them. You can install the script via Terminal/Powershell (and update it from time to time in the same way), it’s pretty straightforward. <a href="https://github.com/black7375/Firefox-UI-Fix#installation-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here’s how to install.</a></p>
<h2>Problem 4: Download Management</h2>
<p>I like Chrome’s download bar at the bottom of the screen, as I need to download and handle many files for work. The fact that it is always visible, in every tab, until you close it, and that it fully integrates the OS’ Drag &amp; Drop capabilities is important to me.</p>
<p>Firefox on the other hand has this little download icon next to the address bar and a separate download manager window (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;+ <kbd>J</kbd>) but it’s not that useful for my use case and I wish there would be something similar to Chrome’s download bar, but there does not seem to be. (Some extensions integrate a download status bar at the bottom, but you can’t drag &amp; drop finished downloads anywhere.)</p>
<p>I probably have to accept some slower workflows here. On a side note, Chrome’s development team <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2023/08/redesigning-chrome-downloads-to-keep.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seems to consider a similar approach</a> to how downloads work as in Firefox. I don’t think they should, but that’s just me.</p>
<h2>Problem 5: Search Icons and Pocket</h2>
<div id="attachment_728"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/firefox-search-suggestions.png?ssl=1"><img data-lazy-fallback="1" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-728" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/firefox-search-suggestions.png?resize=700%2C408&amp;ssl=1" alt="Screenshot of Firefox search suggestions with search engine icons at the bottom" width="700" height="408" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/firefox-search-suggestions.png?w=936&amp;ssl=1 936w, https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/firefox-search-suggestions.png?resize=640%2C373&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/firefox-search-suggestions.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/firefox-search-suggestions.png?w=936&amp;ssl=1 936w, https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/firefox-search-suggestions.png?resize=640%2C373&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/firefox-search-suggestions.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/firefox-search-suggestions.png?resize=700%2C408&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-728">Screenshot of Firefox search suggestions. The search engine icons at the bottom infuriate me.</p></div>
<p>The search engine and whatnot icons on the bottom of URL/search suggestions annoy me. I understand that Mozilla probably makes money with them, but they are are a waste of space and time when I try to use the <kbd>↑</kbd> key to scroll through search results. It first cycles through these things before you reach the last item in the list.</p>
<div id="attachment_729"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/firefox-search-settings.png?ssl=1"><img data-lazy-fallback="1" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-729" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/frunc.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/firefox-search-settings.png?resize=678%2C532&amp;ssl=1" alt="Screenshot of Firefox’ Search shortcut settings.

<p>You can get rid of them by going to Settings → Search → Search Shortcuts. Deactivate all the checkmarks at the most left column. I probably would not have find this solution if <a href="https://feddit.de/post/2324819" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lemmings had not helped me</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t want my browser to advertise services that I don’t (regularly) use, e.g. Pocket. I disabled Pocket completely by going to about:config and changing this parameter:</p>
<pre>extensions.<wbr>pocket.<wbr>enabled = "false"</pre>
<p>In Settings → Homepage, I also deactivated “Sponsored shortcuts”and “Pages saved to pocket”.</p>
<h2>Mission accomplished</h2>
<p>These were the most important things that got in my way after I switched from Chrome to Firefox. I hope you found my tips helpful. Apart from that, Firefox is a “smooth sailing” experience for me. There are many things that I actually like better about Firefox. The integrated Reader Mode (Press F9 to get a probably more legible version of the article you’re on) is great and the massive capabilities to modify its UI are, too. I also applied stricter privacy settings, Firefox allows you to do that. I recommend everyone to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/">try Firefox again</a>, it’s good!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>(These are some notes and quotes on Ellen Ullman’s memoir <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/486625" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Close to the Machine: Technophilia and its discontents</a>
)</p><h3 id="annotations">Annotations</h3><hr><ul><li>About the programming process and how the experience descends from the portrait of concise plans and propositions to chaos managing, she writes:</li></ul><p>“The project begins in the programmer’s mind with the beauty of a crystal. The knowledge I am to represent in code seems lovely in its structuredness. For a time, the world is a calm, mathematical place. […] Yes, I understand. Yes, it can be done. Yes, how straightforward. Oh yes. I <em>see</em>. […] Then something happens. The irregularities of human thinking start to emerge. Now begins a process of frustration.”</p><ul><li>Programming is a terribly immersive activity, that swallows you away from any clear goal or intention that doesn’t reside in the machine. “The goal becomes the creation of the system itself.”</li><li>She approaches the topic of life as a performance attached more to its context than to its performer (you are and do what you think you are supposed to, not what you deeply intend) when discussing revolutionary positions, pg 29.</li><li>“He has the relentless, cheerful smoothness of the salesman, which makes me distrust him implicitly.” - This especifically reminds me, deeply, of some real estate agent Alfonso and I had to interact with to rent our flat in Madrid. I felt about to be scammed since the moment he looked at me. Trust was an antinatural exercise.</li><li>“When I watch the users try the Internet, it slowly becomes clear to me that the Net represents the ultimate dumbing-down of the computer. The users seem to believe that they are connected to some vast treasure trove — all the knowledge of our times, an endless digitized compendium, some electronic library of Alexandria — if only they could figure out how to use it. But they just sit and click, and look disconcertedly at the junk that comes back at them.” - Written before 1997, this is just uncannily appropiate to describe the contemporary Internet and how we all dwell in it.</li><li>“We think we are creating the system, but the system is also creating us.” - Understanding and considering this could be a part of software design. Software plays the role of an extension of our psyche, of ourselves. Excelent software allows us some excellence, treating it as a deliverable piece of trash makes us trashy.</li><li>“We function well in a sea of unknowns. Our experience has only prepared us to deal with confusion. A programmer who denies this is probably lying or densely unaware of himself.”,
“Over the years, the horrifying knowledge of ignorant expertise became normal, a kind of background level of anxiety that only occasionally blossomed into outright fear.” - How much of this is impostor syndrome and how much reality? How different are other fields really? I also feel any new programming task as something foreign, for which I am not ready, basically undoable from my position. But at the same time consider myself able to get into anything and everything, and of fixing and building whatever that can be done. I cannot figure out any straight explanation for such senseless duality, nor feel I adopt the same position for anything else in life.</li><li>“He just wasn’t very good at making contact, which you really can’t hold against someone, much as you’d like too.” - What can be hold against people? Intentions, skills? Where do merit and responsibility start and finish?</li><li>I love how everything Ellen discusses ends up falling together. The style is organized, properly structured, somehow correct. Is this what happens when a programmer can write?</li></ul><h3 id="review">Review</h3><hr><p>If you found out about Ellen Ullman after reading some of her shorter pieces online, this will live up to your expectations. The book is a memoir about her life as a software contractor in the dot-com bubble era. More specifically, about her relationship with code, the culture that was being solidified around it and its contextualized creation process. Her ramblings about programming and the experiences and feelings you get from it are just so engaging, and the personas she describes across the stories are surprisingly similar to what you would find nowadays. In fact, her full portrait of “computer culture” felt uncannily atemporal when I realized the book was written before I was born.</p><p>I also love the openness and sincerity with which she discusses most topics, as the moral inconsistencies she finds on herself and her job. She feels eloquent but close and real, and that’s refreshing in this world. Can’t wait to read everything else from her.</p></div></div>]]></description>

On top, we are typically stubborn and seldom change our opinions and worldview (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_%28cognitive_bias%29" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">anchoring bias</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"> confirmation bias</a>). This is especially problematic when changes happen slowly and in small steps. For instance, the way software development productivity changes in our team.</p><h2 id="a87a">KPI objectivity</h2><p id="63e1">Enter KPIs as the objective truth. Free of subjectivity, perfect, right?</p><p id="9442">Not so fast. In fact, often our data collection and measurement are also biased by us (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">algorithmic bias</a>). And even if that is not the case, unfortunately, KPIs suffer from tunnel vision: they measure what is measurable, while not necessarily all aspects of the situation are. Albert Einstein put it brilliantly:</p><blockquote><p id="ef5a">“Everything that can be counted does not necessarily count; everything that counts cannot necessarily be counted.”</p></blockquote><p id="46bc">This results in perverse motivation in many organizations, where people have to choose between doing their job well (broader reality) or getting promoted for meeting the KPIs (tunnel vision). And that’s exactly the KPI psychosis I described above.</p><figure><figcaption>KPIs are only indicators so they don’t capture the full reality. Image with permission from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/the_data_department" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/user/the_data_department</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="6c51">The trivial solution</h2><p id="97f1">It takes a different mental framing to fix this situation: KPIs should be used in combination with human intuition to enable optimal decision-making. So not just intuition or data, but a constant back and forth of making (i.e. intuition) and testing (i.e. data) hypotheses.</p><p id="5709">This leads us to the importance of explaining what a KPI actually indicates — and not only what it measures. This is often underestimated. Let’s take the example of Time To Last Byte (TTLB), a common metric of service quality that we also use at <a href="https://www.promaton.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Promaton</a>. It measures the time between the request sent by the client and the last byte of the related response from the server. In business terms, this is how much time your customer has to wait to get what they want. It’s easy to calculate and you can easily see how optimizing the runtime of server-side processing would result in improvement in the TTLB. However, you never actually want to improve TTLB per se, what you want to optimize is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drf5ZKd4aVY" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">user experience</a>. And understanding this is essential.</p><p id="239a">If you know that you care about user experience, it can easily happen that you start exploring first the user segment that suffers most from high TTLBs. Maybe you are going to see that these users have something in common, e.g. all those requests are from an area with poor internet connection. Now your course of action will not be optimization of server-side processing, but something else (e.g. deploying in that region or on-premise for those customers). And most importantly maybe this action could easily lead to a smaller overall TTLB improvement than optimizing the most time-consuming process in the backend, yet you clearly improved the user experience more.</p><h2 id="49dc">Getting KPI optimization right</h2><p id="997e">KPIs are not born perfect: they often require lots of conceptualization, trial-and-error learning, or redefinition before you find comfort in relying on them. So you work on reaching your objective and while doing so you constantly check both what your KPI shows and also how much you can rely on it. Let’s say you want your product to be useful for your users in the long term. You start measuring retention, but there are so many conceptual challenges that you’ll have to resolve before your KPI would be really correlated with the long-term usefulness of the product; e.g. things like who a user is and what long-term means. This is the process called KPI optimization.</p><p id="6f73">KPI optimization is not about selecting one such value, telling them it’s bad, and telling your people to optimize it (e.g. our churn is 5%, it should be 2%). The problem with that is that it’s going to discourage people from asking up to which level that number represents reality. Reality both from the validity (it measures actual user loss) and from the reliability (it reliably changes when user loss happens) point of view.</p><p id="8a6b">And finally, people are pretty good at number hacking: when I was about ten years old, I learned that secretly rubbing the mercury container of the thermometer helps to increase my “measured” body temperature. This was the KPI my mother used for deciding if I was (too) sick to go to school. Learning this hack helped me to score quite some extra holidays, but surely didn’t help our family’s objective of keeping kids at home (only) when they are sick.</p><p id="b431">To summarize, here are my recommendations:</p><ul><li id="77bd">Use KPIs in combination with intuition for optimal decision making</li><li id="3fa2">Always keep in mind your actual objective instead of only defining the KPIs</li><li id="8eef">Continuously reflect on the reliability of your KPIs and revise them if necessary</li></ul><p id="0272">Btw, do you want to work in a company that does not suffer from KPI psychosis? Check out our open positions here: <a href="https://careers.promaton.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://careers.promaton.com/</a></p><p id="1704">*: I use the acronym KPI (key performance indicator) instead of “data” because I consider it advantageous to have the word “indicator” always in mind but think of all metrics, numbers, indices, key results etc.</p></div></div>]]></description>

    <p>In 1980, a company called Franklin Computer produced a clone of the Apple II called the Franklin Ace, designed to run the same software.  They copied almost every detail of the Apple II, including all of its ROM based software and all the documentation, and sold it at a lower price than Apple.   We even found a place in the manual where they forgot to change "Apple" to "Ace".   Apple was infuriated, and sued Franklin.  They eventually won, and forced Franklin to withdraw the Ace from the market.</p><p>

	Even though Apple won the case, it was pretty scary for a while, and it wasn't clear until the end that the judge would rule in Apple's favor - Franklin argued that they had a right to copy the Apple II ROMs, since it was just a "functional mechanism" necessary for software compatibility.  We anticipated that someone might try a similar trick with the Macintosh someday.  If they were clever enough (which Franklin wasn't), they could disguise the code (say by systematically permuting some registers) so it wouldn't look that similar at the binary level.  We thought that we better take some precautions.</p><p>

	Steve decided that if a company copied the Mac ROM into their computer, he would like to be able to do a demo during the trial, where he could type a few keystokes into an unmodified infringing machine, and have a large "Stolen From Apple" icon appear on its screen.  The routines and data to accomplish that would have to be incorporated into our ROM in a stealthy fashion, so the cloners wouldn't know how to find or remove it.</p><p>

	It was tricky enough to be a fun project.  Susan designed a nice "Stolen from Apple" icon, featuring prison bars.  Steve Capps had recently come up with a simple scheme for compressing ROM-based icons to save space, so we compressed the icon using his technique, which not only reduced the overhead but also made it much harder to detect the icon.  Finally, we wrote a tiny routine to decompress the icon, scale it up and display it on the screen.  We hid it in the middle of some data tables, so it would be hard to spot when disassembling the ROM.</p><p>

	All you had to do to invoke it is enter the debugger and type a 6 digit hexadecimal address followed by a "G", which meant execute the routine at that address.  We demoed it for Steve and he liked it.  We were kind of hoping someone would copy the ROM just so we could show off our foresight.</p><p>

	As far as I know, no one ever did copy the ROM in a commercial project, so it wasn't really necessary, but it did create some intrigue for a while.  We let it slip that there was a "stolen from Apple" icon hidden in there somewhere, partially to deter people from copying the ROM.  At least one hacker became moderately obsessed with trying to find it.</p><p>

	Steve Jasik was the author of the MacNosy disassembler/debugger, which could be used to create pseudo-source for the ROM.  He found out about the "stolen from Apple" icon pretty early on, and became determined to isolate it.  He lived in Palo Alto, so I would occasionally bump into him, and he would ask me for hints or tell me his latest theory about how it was concealed, which was invariably wrong.</p><p>

	This went on for two or three years, before he finally cracked it: I ran into him and he had it nailed,  telling me about the compressed icon and the address of the display routine.  I congratulated him, but was never sure if he figured it out himself or if someone with access to the source code told him.
