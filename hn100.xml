   <p>The <em>Washington Post</em>'s billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, announced a sweeping new libertarian vision for the paper's opinion sections on Wednesday, just four months after his decision to kill a presidential endorsement of Kamala Harris triggered hundreds of thousands of subscribers to cancel.</p>   <p><em>Post</em> Opinions Editor David Shipley, whom Bezos recruited from Bloomberg Opinions in 2022, chose to resign rather than stay to oversee the paper's revamped sections.</p>   <p>"We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets," Bezos <a href="https://x.com/JeffBezos/status/1894757287052362088" target="_blank"><u>wrote in a memo to staffers</u></a> announcing the changes. "We'll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others."</p>   
   <p>Newspaper op-ed sections have incorporated opposing views for years. The term "op-ed" is literally an abbreviation for pieces running "opposite the editorial pages" that often conflicted with a publisher's editorial line. But Bezos characterized that practice as outdated.</p>   <p>"There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader's doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views," Bezos said. "Today, the internet does that job."</p>   <h3>Shock inside the newsroom</h3>   <p>At an hour-long meeting with opinion writers, Shipley said he did not know what lay ahead, according to an attendee who spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not have permission to speak publicly.</p>   <p>Shipley said he had wanted a "broader, pluralistic place," but that Bezos sought "a focused [opinion] report."</p>   <p>Bezos justified his decision in the memo to staffers. "I am of America and for America, and proud to be so," he wrote. "And a big part of America's success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else."</p>   <p>The decision sparked fresh shock and dismay at the paper. After senior news editors raised concerns at a meeting Wednesday, Executive Editor Matt Murray reassured them that Bezos had given no indication that he wanted to interfere with news coverage, according to two people with direct knowledge. A spokesperson for the <em>Post</em> confirmed his remarks.</p>

   <p>Later in the day, Murray sent a memo to the newsroom to underscore the point: "The independent and unbiased work of The Post's newsroom remains unchanged, and we will continue to pursue engaging impactful journalism without fear or favor." (Murray and Bezos did not reply to requests for comment.)</p>   <p><em>Post</em> Associate Editor David Maraniss, a legendary journalist whose association with the newspaper stretches back more than four decades, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidmaraniss.bsky.social/post/3lj3o3ozerc2d" target="_blank"><u>wrote on Bluesky</u></a> that he would never write for it again as long as Bezos owns it.</p>   
   <p>"One pernicious step after another, Bezos encroached on the <em>Post</em> editorial policy," Maraniss wrote. "Today he seized it fully. The old <em>Washington Post</em> is gone."</p>   <p>Former senior managing editor Cameron Barr, who had been editing projects for the paper, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cameron-barr-72093bb0_today-i-am-ending-my-professional-association-activity-7300598172819546112-TjW-?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAB91b0BakuuTKmXlgSzUTCFIqDVZDWUq6o" target="_blank">announced on LinkedIn that he was severing ties with the <em>Post</em></a>. He wrote that Bezos's changes amount to "an unacceptable erosion of its commitment to publishing a healthy diversity of opinion and argument."</p>   <p>One writer for the opinions section told NPR he was "heartsick," adding, "leadership matters."</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5309725-101" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>NPR spoke to six people with direct knowledge of events for this article. They were given the ability to speak anonymously because they were not authorized to speak about internal matters at the paper.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5309725-102" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Shipley did not respond to requests for comment. According to a person with direct knowledge, Shipley told Bezos that the new approach would violate the <em>Post</em>'s promise of holding power to account.</p>   <h3>Bezos new approach differs dramatically  from first Trump term</h3>   <p>Bezos stood by the newspaper's dogged reporting on the first Trump administration. In that period, the <em>Post </em>adopted the motto "Democracy Dies in Darkness." It won Pulitzer Prizes for coverage of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2022/05/09/pulitzer-prize-public-service/" target="_blank">Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol</a> and, earlier, of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp/2018/04/16/feature/washington-post-wins-pulitzer-prizes-for-roy-moore-investigation-russia-reporting/" target="_blank">Russian interference</a> in the 2016 presidential election.</p>   <p>His business interests, however, have billions of dollars in dealings with the federal government. And Trump's regulators have made clear they intend to take an active role. </p>   <p>Bezos' decision in October to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/25/nx-s1-5165353/washington-post-presidential-endorsement-trump-harris" target="_blank">kill the Harris editorial</a> sparked a furor inside and outside the paper, leading editorial writers to resign and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/04/nx-s1-5248299/cartoonist-quits-wapo-over-bezos-trump-cartoon-washingtonpost" target="_blank">more than 300,000</a> people to cancel their digital subscriptions in a matter of days. (The <em>Post </em>says it has been able to win some subscribers back and garner some new subscribers in the opening weeks of Trump's second term.)</p>   <div id="resg-s1-50914">

                David Shipley resigned as opinions editor of <em>The Washington Post</em> after owner Jeff Bezos declared he wanted the section to focus only on supporting "personal liberties and free markets." In this 2024 photo, Shipley and the newsroom celebrate winning three Pulitzer Prizes.

   <p>As a practical matter, Shipley argued to Bezos, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>'s highly pro-markets pages have had a similar policy for decades. As with the decision not to publish the endorsement of Harris, Shipley's arguments fell on deaf ears.</p>   
   <p>In his memo to staff, Bezos praised Shipley and wrote that he offered the editor the chance to lead the reformed sections. "I suggested to him if the answer wasn't 'hell yes,' then it had to be 'no,'" Bezos wrote.</p>   <p>The <em>Post</em> has aggressively covered the new administration. But Bezos appears to have embraced the president's return to power. Bezos personally paid $1 million toward Trump's inaugural fund. He and his fiancée Lauren Sánchez traveled to Trump's Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, to socialize with the Trumps. And, along with other digital chieftains, Bezos sat behind the president as he was sworn in for a second term.</p>   <h3>Opinions editor repeatedly in tough spot</h3>   <p>Shipley's two-and-a-half years have brought acclaim for the section, with two Pulitzer Prizes and two Loeb Awards. But his standing was deeply undercut by Bezos's recent decisions, especially over the Harris endorsement.</p>   <p>When Shipley decided to withhold a cartoon from the Pulitzer-winning staffer Ann Telnaes about Bezos from publication, he told colleagues he believed he was making a decision on the merits, not pulling his punches. The cartoon depicted Bezos abasing himself along with other tech titans before Trump.</p>

   <p>"Not every editorial judgment is a reflection of a malign force," Shipley said in a statement shared at the time with NPR. "My decision was guided by the fact that we had just published a column on the same topic as the cartoon and had already scheduled another column — this one a satire — for publication. The only bias was against repetition."</p>   <p>Shipley told colleagues privately that he understood, given the moment, it might be hard to credit his actual motivations.</p>   <p>The paper <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/26/nx-s1-5166062/washington-post-endorsement-controversy" target="_blank">has bled veteran talent</a> from both the opinion and news sides since the news broke about the killed editorial. <em>Post</em> journalists left for the <em>Atlantic</em>, the <em>New York Times</em>, the<em> Wall Street Journal</em>, and CNN among other outlets.</p>   
   <p>But <em>Post </em>Publisher and Chief Executive Will Lewis celebrated the change in direction on Wednesday. Lewis previously served for six years in the same role at the <em>Journal</em>, which is owned by Trump ally and conservative media magnate Rupert Murdoch. He has advocated for a similar approach at the <em>Post</em>. </p>   <p>Bezos hired Lewis, in significant part, due to his belief the British journalist could build better bridges to Trump and to conservatives. As well as serving Murdoch as an executive for a decade, Lewis was previously editor of the conservative <em>Telegraph </em>in the U.K. and later served as a consultant for Tory Prime Minister Boris Johnson.  </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5309725-104" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"I am very excited about this new clarity and transparency, and cannot wait to see it brought to life in our opinion section. Every Day," Lewis said in a note to staff. "This is not about siding with any political party. This is about being crystal clear about what we stand for as a newspaper. Doing this is a critical part of serving as a premier news publication across America and for all Americans."</p>

<p>Your camera has the ability to take three dimensional photos. Your screen has the ability to display three dimensional photos. You’ve probably never used either. This isn’t a hidden feature of some new phone hardware release, it’s a feature of your brain. All your brain needs to see in 3D is two pictures, and you can trick your brain into seeing 3D on a flat screen using just your eye muscles. I will teach you how. I’ll also tell you why you should.</p>



<h2>Binocular Vision, and Faking It</h2>



<p>Around a third of your brain is devoted to vision, and accordingly, it is amazing at it. From just the two small 2D images that are sent to your brain from the backs of your eyeballs, your brain reconstructs the entire 3D scene that you experience when you look around. Because your eyes are a few inches apart, they see two different views of the same scene, and those two views are all your brain needs. Distance causes objects to shift relative to each other when you see them from different angles. You can see this most clearly by moving your head from side to side and watching how things move. Your brain uses that discrepancy between the two views of your two eyes to reconstruct depth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because your brain has this power, all you need to do to see an image in 3D is to send different images to each eye. It doesn’t matter how you do it. Every 3D display technology works this way, the only difference between them is how they get each image to only one eye.</p>



<p>Red/Blue 3D glasses filter out images that have the same color as the plastic lens. Modern 3D movies use polarizing filters, but the principle is the same. Two images are projected using orthogonal polarizations of light, and are filtered out by lenses in the glasses with the opposite polarization. Holograms show different images at different angles, and your eyes are at different angles. VR goggles put separate images on the screens in front of each eye that correspond to the views of two eye-spaced cameras in the virtual world.</p>



<h2>Seeing Cross Views</h2>



<p>If you don’t have any fancy technology, that doesn’t matter. You have eyes, a camera, eye muscles, and a brain, and it turns out that’s all you need.</p>

<p>If you have two images that show the views from two different positions, all you have to do to see the objects in 3D is to have one eye look at one image, and the other eye look at the other, and your brain will do the rest. You can do this either by crossing your eyes a little bit, or diverging your eyes a little bit. Most people have only ever deliberately controlled their eye muscles to cross their eyes, so find that to be easier. Accordingly most stereograms are designed to look correct when you cross your eyes. To use the other method the images have to be swapped or the 3D effect will be inverted.</p>

<p>Doing it correctly feels like this: First the images split in two, and you’ll see flickering blurry copies of both images slightly offset from each other. Then as you cross your eyes more, eventually the two images in the middle will align. The center image will resolve into a clear 3D image, with two flickering copies of it next to them.</p>



<p>If you aren’t sure how to do this, there are two good ways. The easiest, if you are comfortable crossing your eyes, is just to cross your eyes slowly, so you can stop when the images align. If you aren’t comfortable crossing your eyes, then the best way is to focus on something in front of the picture, and hope that the images align on top of each other as a side effect. You can do this by holding your finger substantially in front of the image, and focusing solely on the finger with your eyes, while turning your mind’s attention to the image behind it while keeping your eyes still. This is hard to do right, so it might be easier to learn to cross your eyes first.</p>



<h2>Making Cross Views</h2>



<p>All you need is two pictures taken from two different positions shifted horizontally. The easiest way to do this is to take a picture, take a small step to the left or right, and take another picture. If the object is close, you only need to move the camera a few inches. If the object is far away you may need to take a full step to the side. How far you step will determine how strong the depth effect is, which is ultimately a matter of taste. A stronger depth effect makes the result more dramatic, but makes the image harder to resolve when you cross your eyes.</p>

<p>To turn the image into a cross view, you just need to put the images next to each other. Any way you do this is fine, even just looking at the two pictures next to each other in your camera roll. If the 3D effect looks backwards, just swap the images. There is free software that can do a better job by aligning the images automatically, adding borders, and allowing easy adjustments, <a href="https://stereo.jpn.org/eng/stphmkr/">Stereo Photo Maker</a> for Windows or OSX, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kra2008.crosscam">Cross Cam</a> for Android.</p>



<h2>Why bother? Isn’t 3D just a gimmick?</h2>



<p>3D has mostly been a gimmick. 3D movies use the depth effect mainly to throw things at you and make you flinch, not to add to the art. But every sense we have should have art in it, and our depth perception has been shortchanged. Depth is such an immature medium that we haven’t gotten past the kind of whiz bang novelty of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Arriv%C3%A9e_d%27un_train_en_gare_de_La_Ciotat">The Arrival of the Train</a>. (Notable exceptions to this are Avatar and Half Life: Alyx, which are enormously enhanced by being in 3D.) It is a huge part of how we experience the world, we shouldn’t give up on it.</p>



<p>There are some things that just can’t look the same without depth. To photograph a forest, and convey anything like the experience of being there, you need the world to give you other visual cues to add depth to the image, like fog. The world usually doesn’t do this, and as a result nearly every photograph of a forest looks like a flat disorganized mess. Add depth, and suddenly all the complexity and beauty reappears. You can show people what a forest is for the first time.</p>

<p>To photograph a cave, and convey the layers and scale of the rock, you need clever lighting, and even then it usually fails. The geometry of a cave is too unusual for cues like lighting and shadow to work reliably. The rocks are all the same color. Add depth, and there is no more ambiguity. The shapes take shape.</p>

<p>Depth literally adds another dimension to the composition. You’re no longer just positioning objects to lead the eye around the page, but also to lead the eye through space. What compositions could we create with this? Architecture or stage plays probably have more to tell us about this than visual art does. But it’s mostly still brand new and wide open.

<h2>Parallel Views</h2>



<p>If you are able to diverge your eyes instead of crossing them, then arranging the images the opposite way can give you a more relaxing and more natural stereo effect. This corresponds to focusing past the image instead of in front of it. There is an upper limit to how far you can physically diverge your eyes, they can’t go past infinity, so parallel view images need to be smaller to take up less of your viewing area.</p>

Link, who had spent most of the past half century playing gin rummy by the side of the pool at the Beverly Hills Hotel, in Los Angeles. For forty-two years, from the time he discovered the hotel, in 1950, until it closed, last December 30th, Irving’s days had been as well ordered and as predictable as the Sun King’s. At seven o’clock every morning, wearing one of the many perfectly fitted tropical-weight suits that have been a special affection of his since a memorable day in the nineteen-thirties, he would stroll over from his house, in the lower reaches of Beverly Hills; enter the hotel under the long, sloping green-and-white striped awning that extended all the way from the driveway, above Sunset Boulevard, to the main entrance; turn right in the lobby; and arrive at the Polo Lounge. Often he and the hostess, Bernice Philbin, would be the first two people there, and they would have a polite conversation before Irving took his place in his booth—the first half circle to your left as you came in—and ordered breakfast: scrambled eggs back in the days when people ate eggs, and, more recently, banana and granola with skim milk.</p><p>Occasionally, when the weather was particularly fine, he would take his breakfast outside, under the great Brazilian peppertree on the curving flagstone Polo Lounge patio. Then, at around nine, he would stroll back through the lobby and follow the curving, carpeted stairs down to the lower hallway, where he would stop to say good morning to all the people in the downstairs shops: to Tony, the barber, for instance, who would just be laying out his razors and scissors, and Amir, the haberdasher, who specialized in cashmere coats with chinchilla linings, and who would often be at work on a new suit for Irving. Then Irving would walk out through the glass door at the end of the hallway into the allée of jacarandas and bougainvilleas that led to the Beverly Hills Hotel pool. He would wave good morning to Sven Peterson and his pool crew, who would be scrutinizing visitors from the safety of a small, tollhouse-style booth, and walk down the concrete steps toward the pool itself. One of the pool boys would scamper ahead to “set up” a chaise for Irving—that is, drape a flamingo-colored towel over the chair’s buff-colored vinyl—on the south, or sunny, side of the pool while Irving went over to his cabana, on the opposite side, to change into his swimming trunks. Then he would sunbathe for a few hours on the chaise. At noon, Irving would retire again to his cabana and change for lunch, which he would occasionally eat under an umbrella-shaded table in the Patio Club, or sometimes at the Bistro Garden, on Canon Drive, a favorite spot of his. After lunch, Irving would return to the cabana, change again—usually into what is called “resort wear”—and set up a table just outside for the gin game. On any reasonably sunny day, the pool would by then be echoing with the names of well-known people being called to the phone, as well as with the names of unknown people being called to the phone by themselves in the forlorn hope that one day this would help them become well known, too.</p><p>From his vantage in front of his cabana, Irving could not only watch the parade go by but get the parade to sit down with him and play cards. Over the years, his gin game included Hollywood luminaries ranging from Tony Martin to such lesser figures as Ken Berg, the Koo-Koo-Roo King. Irving is an inordinately polite man, and words like “starlets,” “moguls,” and “kibitzers” never cross his lips; the world he saw was one in which, as he put it, “magnificent-looking young women, full of theatrical drive,” lay on chaises in order to impress many of the astute businessmen who had decided to “take a fling in the picture business.” All through the day, Irving’s own business—a hard-to-follow mixture of liquor distribution, real-estate deal making, and all-around middleman stuff—would be unhurriedly intertwined with all his other activities, like creepers rising on a trellis.</p><p>Irving would play cards until sunset. Most days, in fact, he and Sven closed the pool together. Then Irving would either walk back home to his wife and two children, or, after his wife died, in 1990, change yet again, and have dinner at the Bistro Garden.</p><p>Except for a brief period in the early sixties—when Irving, through no fault of his own, became trapped in the contest between Bobby Kennedy and Jimmy Hoffa and was in effect banished for a while by Kennedy from the Polo Lounge—one day of Irving’s has been almost exactly like the next. By the end of 1992, he had spent approximately fifteen thousand days by the side of the pool. (Irving has never learned how to swim.) “I guess I’m a creature of habit,” he says.</p><p>In recent years, people would come by the pool and ask to meet Irving, just so they could say that they had at last met a man who had it all figured out. His circle of admirers, probably larger than that of any other man who has spent his days by the side of a pool, extended from the pool boys (“I’m in awe of him,” one of them said the week before Christmas, watching Irving sun himself on an icy Southern California morning. “He’s what—ninety?” Eighty-seven, actually. “And he’s sunproof. He’s cancer-proof. What does he do? How does he make his money? How does he do it?”) all the way to Richard Koshalek, the director of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, who has admired Irving from an aesthetic distance, as though he were a Diebenkorn seascape. “It’s one of the great performance pieces in Los Angeles history,” Koshalek says. “He exemplifies something important about L.A., which is that the fragmentation of the city, which everyone always decries, also means that there are these remarkable subcultures all around, where people with very specific, amazing plumage flourish.”</p><p>Last December 30th, however, the Sultan of Brunei, who has owned the Beverly Hills Hotel since 1988, decided to close it—for reasons that are either sensible and as plain as day, if you ask people who work for the Sultan now, or murky and irrational, if you ask people who were working for him up until December 30th. Officially, the hotel will be closed for renovations for two years—“twenty-four months” is the formula the Sultan’s people prefer—but there are people who think that it may be closed much longer, or even for good. Irving now has to figure out another way of spending his days: Louis XIV expelled from Versailles and shuffling back and forth among other guys’ châteaux.</p><p>“The Sultan is the only owner of the hotel in the past forty years who has not been a close personal friend of mine,” Irving said one morning in the last week of December, as he sat at breakfast in the now nearly empty Polo Lounge. “Manny Borenstein, Ben Silberstein, Marvin Davis—I played cards with them all. I wish the Sultan and I might have sat down together. My experience with potentates is larger than you might think. I once had a maharaja as a warm personal friend. Now, observing the Sultan’s policy, I’d say that he is a very astute businessman.” Irving toyed, a little sadly, with his banana and granola. “And in the long run what we all have to believe is that this sabbatical will prove to be an extremely astute move, and that we’ll all be grateful when we recommence in two years. If it is astute, however, I don’t yet grasp <em>how</em> it’s astute. I run the figures through my head very often, and the project doesn’t cost out in terms of what he paid, what he’ll have to invest, and how hard it will be to reassemble this—this magnificent cast of characters and memories and associations.” He stared out the floor-to-ceiling windows at the peppertree, dominating the abandoned Polo Lounge patio. Then he went on, “Of course, what we’re all learning—” By “we,” Irving meant the hotel regulars, who are now being dispossessed—a group for which he serves as a sort of unpaid, ex-officio chairman, and on all of whom he has bestowed royal titles: Sven Peterson the Pool Prince, Bernice Philbin the Queen of the Polo Lounge, Chris Dunn the Crown Prince of Parking. “What we’re all learning is something new. Which is that if you’re a sultan it really doesn’t matter how astute you are. If you’re a sultan, you get to do whatever you want to do. Astuteness is somehow not your problem in life.”</p><p>Irving is one part Meyer Wolfshiem, one part Colonel Stingo, and eight parts everything your grandfather in Fort Lauderdale would dream of being if only he could get loose from your grandmother. He is certainly the best-dressed eighty-seven-year-old in America. He is slim, has beautiful, almost silver-white hair, a dashing white mustache, which recalls those of the rakish leading men of the forties—Cesar Romero or Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.—and a wardrobe that extends into new vistas of rococo elegance every time you see him. His appreciation of fine clothes is mostly untouched by narcissism. Spying an old friend just arrived at the hotel and wearing, let’s say, a white linen suit with a blue shirt and a flowered Liberty print tie—nothing much at all, really—Irving, dressed in a black cashmere Edwardian coat, chocolate kid gloves, and a camel’s-hair scarf, might pause before crossing the lobby and, after a warm handshake, say, “I didn’t want to come over too quickly. I was having too much pleasure in admiring that wonderful suit you’re wearing, and observing how perfectly you’ve accessorized it.”</p><p>On the Tuesday of that last week, I met Irving at the hotel (we had become friends several years before), got into his gold Lexus, and drove off with him to have lunch at the Bistro Garden. On the drive, which, in the best Beverly Hills tradition, took us eight blocks, Irving began to hum. “Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few,” he sang under his breath as we waited at a light and looked out across the depopulated streets. “I’m thinking of moving to the Beverly Hilton. Have you seen it? It’s the white building on Santa Monica Boulevard. Merv Griffin owns it, and it seems to be a promising place. I’d be grateful to have your view. What I’m thinking of right now is: have breakfast at the Century Plaza and then move to the Beverly Hilton for the gin game in the afternoon.” The thought of breaking up his day seemed to depress him a little, and he sank into silence, until he spotted a mild, ferrety man slowly walking up Canon Drive. “Now, there’s a very good friend of mine,” he said. “One of the most astute businessmen and lawyers in California.” He slowed the car and gave a honk on the horn. The man stopped and turned warily. He cautiously tried to make out who was inside the car, and then, spotting Irving at last, broke into a smile and gave a solid, official wave. Then he walked on. “That’s my good friend the legendary Sidney Korshak,” Irving explained. “He was Hoffa’s lawyer, and played a part in my dark years, which I’ll tell you about at some point.”</p><p>We walked together into the Bistro Garden. Irving said a warm hello to the owner and then to the tuxedoed maître d’, and took his usual table, on the edge of the garden. He ordered his lunch—baked whitefish—and began to talk about how he had come to spend so much of his life at the Beverly Hills Hotel.</p><p>“My story begins on the Lower East Side of New York,” he said. “That’s where I was born, the ninth child of a rather important rabbi. I was the only one of the family who was born in New York—everyone else had begun life in Vienna. My father died when I was twenty, and the truth is that I never really felt I knew him well, though he was, I’m told, an exceptionally astute Talmudic scholar, and he did like to play cards.” Irving smiled. He was wearing a navy-blue pin-striped suit whose stripes were outlined in gold thread; a hand-painted silk tie decorated in a soft pattern derived from Monet’s water lilies; a shirt with fine red checks and a white collar, and with the points of the collar edged in the same red check; a cream cashmere vest; and a pocket square in the same hand-painted water-lily pattern as his tie. Small gold threads ran through the pocket square, and his cuffs were closed with two shields of silver, with his initials, “IVL,” set into them, and a small stone to punctuate each monogram.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In August, 1933, when he was twenty-seven, Irving married Nan Ofgang at his older sister’s house, in Brooklyn. “I had to borrow ten dollars to pay the rabbi,” he said. “We had nothing but guts and faith, and my wife had a job at the cosmetics department at the Thrifty Drug Company. I had heard from a friend, however, about a novelty company that had gone broke and abandoned a million units of a fortune-telling device in a warehouse in New York. This was called the Fortunscope. I borrowed money to lay claim to the inventory, and Nan and I decided to go on the road. There were a million Fortunscopes in that warehouse, and I was determined to sell them all. Now, the Fortunscope was a device in which you spun an arrow and found your fortune. All the fortunes were complimentary. I had a sample case, and would offer the Fortunscope to retailers. Once they placed an order, I would send it back to the New York warehouse, and Fortunscopes would be shipped to the retailer. It was a painstaking business: a gross to a department store, a dozen Fortunscopes to small five-and-dimes. I bought them for two cents and sold them for fifteen cents. In our first two years, we couldn’t afford sleeping cars, so we slept sitting up, in the day coach.</p><p>“Oh, those were wonderful days, though! We travelled from Philadelphia to Seattle, through the Middle West, Minnesota, and the various Dakotas. We were determined to visit every city with a population of more than twenty-five thousand. It was one day in some small city in one of the Carolinas—I can no longer remember which—that I was walking down a street and saw three magnificent Palm Beach suits in the window of a men’s store. One was cream, one was white, and one was navy. I went in and bought them all, eighteen dollars apiece. I’ve tried never to be badly dressed since.</p><p>“Our odyssey ended here, in California, where I took the stake we had made through the Fortunscope and went into the dress business. We liked California, but we both became homesick and decided to try moving back East. We actually found a house in Connecticut, and were ready to close on it. But then thoughts of California filled our heads. So we tossed a coin to see where we should go, and it turned up heads—California. We came back out in 1949 and bought a little house here in Beverly Hills for six thousand dollars. By then my beautiful daughter, Gale, was born. I have a son, Rand, as well, who’s a dean at Sonoma State University. I’ve always been an early riser, and so one morning—not wanting to wake my wife and children—I slipped out of the house and went looking for breakfast. The hotel was at the bottom of the street, on Sunset Boulevard, so I slipped into the Polo Lounge and ordered breakfast, and my life at the hotel began that day.”</p><p>The Beverly Hills Hotel that Irving walked into that morning was, though Irving did not know it then, in the midst of a transformation. The hotel had been built in 1912, at a time when Beverly Hills was still essentially rural; in fact, the hotel was the first large building that the city had seen. It was decorated in the heavy, leadfooted style then called Mission Revival. The halls were uncarpeted, the rooms had exposed beams, and the hotel’s various amenities had a severe, purposeful look: the swimming pool was a place where people went to go swimming, and the Polo Lounge, which had been christened by Will Rogers, looked more or less like the kind of rough-hewn place in which you might actually wish to lounge after playing polo.</p><p>By 1941, the hotel had been in and out of bankruptcy, and it was bought by a consortium of show-business people headed by the banker Hernando Courtright, who decided to have the place remodelled in the style today loosely referred to as Deco but actually called by experts Coffee Shop Moderne. Courtwright had a new wing built along Crescent Road, on the east side of the hotel, and the interior of the hotel was redesigned: its hard Spanish angles were rounded off, and it became a paradise of curving stairs, recessed lighting, and pink and green stucco. The Fountain Coffee Shop, with its famous black S-shaped counter, was installed downstairs. A thirty-foot-high sign—“The Beverly Hills” inscribed in low relief in a looping, almost feminine cursive hand—was visible from Sunset.</p><p>It was during this period that the Beverly Hills Hotel pool achieved its familiar form. The pool was set in a tropical garden. On the eastern and western edges were three rows of lounge chairs; each group of three chairs was punctuated by a small table topped with translucent glass, and a telephone rested upon each table. At the north end, a small white fountain played all day. To the south, behind a hedge of lime trees in white urns, lay the Patio Club: ten white metal tables under umbrellas, with a small bar in the back, and eight shaded booths set into one side wall. On the west side of the pool were the cabanas—little tents with striped awnings, like jousting tournament pavilions. Each had a chair, a chaise of its own, and a small door leading to a changing room just behind. (A second group of cabanas was mounted, more discreetly, above the chaises on that side, nestled into a little overhanging promontory, like a Tibetan monastery; these upper cabanas were, by legend, favored by Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe and other movie stars who were either too chubby to be looked at or too nude to be respectable.) The only sounds at the pool—aside from soft piped-in classical music and the sound of people being paged—were the metallic whirring and put-put of the blender at the bar, preparing frozen drinks (it was a tradition for the pool boys to make the rounds of the chaises every day at two-thirty with sherbet freezes in the heraldic house colors, pink and green), the breeze in the palms, and the constant murmur of boastful, wheedling, confident monologue.</p><p>It is sometimes said that the heyday of the pool dates from the heyday of the great studios, but in fact its heyday was just after theirs: its high period occurred in the mid-fifties—the era of Sam Spiegel (who stayed in the hotel for a long time) and Joseph Levine (who did, too) and Stanley Kramer and the other independent producers who began to assemble films from the ground up. It was the era of “international” casts, freelance directors, and creative financing. There was a new kind of negotiating to be done, which required a neutral place to negotiate, and the place that a lot of people chose was the pool of the Beverly Hills Hotel.</p><p>“Now, how I got my cabana had a great deal to do with what happened at the hotel,” Irving was saying. He and I had returned from lunch and were sitting together by the side of the pool. There would be no gin game that day; the regulars had all gone off to other hotels. The weather had turned unseasonably chilly; at certain moments, you could actually see your breath. But a solitary man in brown trunks, whom Irving referred to as the Hamburger Hamlet King, was lying bare-chested on a chaise on the other side of the pool. (“If you get yourself focussed in the sun,” he had said when we walked in, “it’s actually quite warming.”) “Looking back, in later years, it’s quite remarkable that I got my cabana at all,” Irving went on. “What happened was that Hernando Courtwright, who was responsible for the renovation, sold the hotel in 1953 to a couple of gentlemen from Detroit—Manny Borenstein and Ben Silberstein. Silberstein was a lawyer; Borenstein was a very astute businessman.” Irving’s tone implied that Silberstein was not. “They began to make a great deal of money. But Silberstein wanted to keep the profits for himself, and Borenstein wanted to plow the money back into the hotel. They quarrelled endlessly, for years, but neither could budge the other. Now, each had forty-five per cent, and two or three other people had the rest. Silberstein’s sister, for instance, owned two per cent. That turned out to be important, as you’ll see. They agreed to sell—Borenstein to Silberstein. Silberstein got a good deal, and Borenstein, as part of the package, got a ten-year lease, for no money, on a suite and a cabana. But his cabana was next to Silberstein’s, and by that time there was so much bad blood between them that he didn’t want to be anywhere near Silberstein, so he gave the cabana to me. We were friends. I had begun the gin game several years before, and Manny enjoyed it.</p><p>“So, because of the ill feeling and misunderstanding between Borenstein and Silberstein, I had my cabana, when only two or three years later grown men would have killed for that cabana. There were thirteen cabanas, and in summer months they were almost impossible to get, even at a hundred dollars a day. A cabana meant power, it meant glamour, it meant that you had a place in the world. Everyone came to the hotel then. Every important personality in the picture business. I knew them all. Clark Gable, Tyrone Power, John Wayne, Buddy Rogers, Don Ameche.” Irving is essentially a democrat; Buddy Rogers and Clark Gable exist for him on more or less the same plane. “Orson Welles, Marlene Dietrich. How well I remember that memorable day when Dietrich broke the dress code in the Polo Lounge! Women were not allowed to wear slacks. It was an absolute prohibition. Now, Dietrich entered the loggia room in slacks.”</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“They let her in. She was Marlene Dietrich, after all.”</p><p>The Hamburger Hamlet King jogged over—there were goose bumps all over his almost purple tanned skin—and he and Irving began to talk. Then the Hamburger Hamlet King returned to his chaise and peremptorily summoned the one remaining pool boy. “Can you believe that? Only one,” Irving said. “Now, in those days the people who worked here at the hotel had influence. They had power. To get a good chaise from Sven, a good table from Bernice—well, grown men would plead with me to put in a good word for them. Even the parking was competitive. Who parked your car. It was in the nature of the picture business, you see, to be like that. It is a nest of insecurities. Now, I have sat here”—he waved toward the cabanas behind us—“for forty-two years and watched the picture business, and the thing that I have learned about the picture business is this: Keep out of the picture business. They can strip you naked and leave nothing behind. I knew everyone who mattered in the picture business, and the ones who made real money were the ones who expanded beyond the picture business.</p><p>“The only time I ever really got involved in the picture business was when several gentlemen were making a picture with Hal Holbrook called ‘The Kidnapping of the President.’ They came to me to see if I could introduce them to anyone who could help with the financing. Well, at that point I wanted to do something surprising for my grandchildren, so I encouraged these gentlemen, and they offered me a bit part in the picture, as an Air Force general. When the picture came out, my grandchildren were delighted.</p><p>“Now, I was explaining how the hotel came to be sold to the Sultan, which has led us to all this. You see, the two daughters of Silberstein inherited the hotel, and one of them, Seema, at the time of Silberstein’s death was married to Ivan Boesky. Boesky, who was also very astute, decided to sell the hotel. The sisters didn’t get along—the Beverly Hills Hotel curse, you could call this. So he bought the two per cent the aunt still had—you recall the aunt I mentioned?—and got it for himself. The balance had tipped, and now he could sell the hotel. There were two real bids: one from the Sultan of Brunei and one from my good friend Marvin Davis, whom I once tried to help buy CBS. Marvin—do you know Marvin? Well, in addition to being a wonderfully astute businessman he’s—” Irving groped for a word. “He’s a wonderfully Falstaffian figure,” he said at last, delicately. “We had breakfast together once, and he asked me to teach him how to dress. I said, ‘Draw up a contract!’ But he never did. Anyway, Marvin Davis explained to me that both he and the Sultan of Brunei offered a hundred and thirty-five million, but that Muriel wanted to sell it to an American rather than to a foreigner. So Marvin bought the hotel. But it was only after he bought the hotel that they pursued the due diligence—checking the plumbing, the wiring, the corroding. He realized that it would take millions to fix it. ‘Irving,’ he told me, ‘I made a bad deal.’ Then he gets a call from the Sultan of Brunei. The Sultan is still dying to buy the Beverly Hills Hotel. ‘Not for sale,’ Marvin says. He’s an astute Sultan, as sultans go, but no match for Marvin Davis. Marvin has nerves of steel. Of course, it’s much easier to have nerves of steel when you have money of gold. That’s a maxim of mine. So the Sultan ended up paying a lot more than a hundred and thirty-five million.</p><p>“It was too much to pay, of course—what the Sultan paid. People have a hard time understanding the hotel business. There’s an interesting sidelight to this story. Let’s go back to the late fifties, when Howard Hughes had three bungalows and twenty-one rooms permanently taken at the hotel, although he only visited for a few weeks each year. I used to observe Mr. Hughes going from one bungalow to another: one bungalow for Jean Peters, his wife; one for Hughes; and one for his mistress, who was rotated every month. Now, this is the interesting part. Ben Silberstein came to me upset, because he was going to have to throw Hughes out. Throw out Howard Hughes! I asked why. Because the rooms were not producing any income. No food, no services. Hughes thought that everybody must be holding him in awe because he had all those rooms, and in fact they were going to have to kick him out. So Hughes checked out, and went to Las Vegas. He was not terribly missed by any of us. My point is that the hotel business is not as simple as it looks. The Sultan owns the hotel, but he discovers that it needs work to bring it up to date. So he’ll spend millions. The problem is that if you close the hotel and spend the millions, by then all the regulars will have moved on—to the Hilton, the Peninsula, the Bel-Air. Did I mention to you that I was thinking of moving to the Hilton? I should go over and spend more time there before I decide. But I hate to leave the hotel.”</p><p>In its last weeks, there were only a dozen paying guests left in the Beverly Hills Hotel; Sven Peterson at one point was even seen waiting on tables at the Patio Club. The doors to the unoccupied rooms were often left open for hours by the maids, and, peering inside, you saw a kind of anthology of forlorn, forgotten de-luxe styles: rooms lined with mirrors and Buffet-like paintings; rooms with wall-to-wall shag carpeting; rooms with “Persian” rugs and small terraces; rooms that looked like sets for James Bond movies; rooms that looked like sets for Doris Day and Rock Hudson movies.</p><p>Over the past twelve months, the decision to close down the Beverly Hills Hotel and remodel it has been much argued over in Beverly Hills, but, Beverly Hills being Beverly Hills, the argument has taken a peculiarly Beverly Hills form, with much of the argument conducted in the weekly “giveaway” papers. The Beverly Hills community, which is heavily Jewish, has always mistrusted the Sultan, who is, of course, Muslim, and whose little, wealthy country has voted against Israel in the United Nations, and this larger mistrust took the local form of suspicion that he and his minions intended to destroy the hotel “landmarks”—the Polo Lounge and the pool, in particular. There were even dark rumors—not entirely implausible, given the shaky state of small Islamic principalities—that the Sultan wanted the hotel remodelled in order to have it ready to use as a palace in exile.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Most hotel people, however, think that the Sultan is doing what the Sultan has to do. “The whole thing began to come apart very quickly,” a hotel-business insider explained. “Until the mid-eighties, there was a ninety-per-cent occupancy rate, and the hotel wasn’t even allowed to be booked by tourist agencies. But then the occupancy rate declined suddenly and precipitously. What was happening was that the clientele was dying off, and it wasn’t being replaced by younger Hollywood people. The occupancy rate dropped into the mid-sixties. And the competitive situation became intolerable: the Beverly Wilshire was upgraded, and then the Beverly Hilton. The Beverly Hills, by comparison, still had—well, it still had window units instead of central air-conditioning.” (When you talk to Los Angeles hotel people, this issue comes up again and again: “window unit” is always pronounced a little sotto voce, in a tone that might be reserved in other hotel circles for the term “chamber pot.”)</p><p>Officially, the renovation of the hotel will include the construction of an underground parking lot and a reduction in the number of rooms. Each suite will have a “luxury” bathroom, with a double marble sink and a television. A fax machine will be installed in every suite. “People—show-business people—used to want a hotel that created an illusion of <em>leisure</em>,” one hotel man told me. “Welcoming your guest out onto the patio of your room for breakfast in your terry robe—that kind of thing. The Beverly Wilshire, though, pioneered an illusion of power, which is what wealthy people, and particularly people in show business, want now. You’re in your suite, faxing stuff, when people come in. The hotel has to respond to that change.”</p><p>Although in the last few years the hotel made a halfhearted effort to promote itself as a kind of dowager empress—with stories planted in the press about the history of the place, the enduring charm of Bernice, the unchanged décor of the Polo Lounge—that kind of nostalgic, ironic appeal seemed not to be very alluring to the powerful movie-and-television industry people the hotel was losing to the competition down the street. What veterans of the leisure industry call the South Beach Phenomenon, after the Miami Beach strip—a phenomenon in which what had been innocently luxurious to one generation then became slightly passé to an in-between generation, only to suddenly become fashionable once again, to a still younger crowd—never took hold in Beverly Hills. Richard Koshalek feels that this lack of historical affection is a typically Los Angeles phenomenon. “You know, we based the entire color scheme of L.A. MOCA on the colors of the Polo Lounge—that green and pink coloring,” he says. “It seemed to Isozaki, the architect, that they represented a kind of mystical, heraldic, symbolic coloring of Los Angeles. But it’s very hard to get people in L.A. to care about their own disappearing monuments. The hot-dog stand, the Brown Derby—the things that have seemed to outsiders to define authentic L.A. culture—leave most moneyed people here very uneasy.”</p><p>Koshalek’s principle seems to be borne out by the evolution of the hotel’s clientele in its declining years. Movie people, the theory runs, tend to value extreme clarity in their lines of power and obligation. (One non-movie person who has regular dealings with movie people says that whenever a certain agent has even the smallest favor done for him, he immediately sends lavish and expensive gifts not only to the one doing the favor but to all of that person’s secretaries and assistants, whom in many cases he may never have met.) Hollywood is essentially a feudal society, and in a feudal society what matters most is that the feudal powers never put themselves in even a mildly ambiguous situation—that they never run the risk of looking ridiculous. Hollywood people, this argument goes on, like to build their own, indubitably serious establishments as soon as they can—I. M. Pei’s C.A.A. building is an example of this compulsion—instead of taking over old ones. Irony—even the kind of simple, nostalgic irony that involves appreciating the dated, period look of a slightly passé swimming pool—is a disruptive, cosmopolitan virtue, favored in cultures, like New York’s, in which the primary social skill is not obtaining a fixed place within a hierarchy but being able to enter as many circles as you possibly can.</p><p>Throughout the eighties, a number of “European” hotels were opened in Los Angeles, with an eye to a New York crowd that was supposedly put off by the presumed tackiness of the Hollywood hotels, but those new, elegant hotels tended to be frequented by show-business types, while the Beverly Hills Hotel was the one that became a favorite haunt of New Yorkers. In recent years, the clientele of the hotel had become particularly heavy with professional ironists—New York art-world people. On one morning about two years ago, in fact, the only people at the pool (except, of course, for Irving) were a good chunk of the staff of the Museum of Modern Art’s Department of Painting &amp; Sculpture. William Rubin, the director emeritus, was down in the shallow end; his wife, Phyllis Hattis, was dangling her legs in the shallow end; Lynn Zelevansky, the senior curator, was sunning in a chaise (Kirk Varnedoe, the department’s current director, had left the hotel only a couple of days before). Lounging in chairs at poolside were the art dealer Larry Gagosian and the photographer Sheila Metzner. You can’t make a living on a crowd like that. Irving’s own notes on the hotel, from a set of recollections he has prepared about his life, record this change simply and plaintively: “Polo Lounge. Power breakfasts and lunches. Lines at night extended deep into lobby. Not anymore.”</p><p>“I’ve heard very <em>encouraging</em> things about the breakfast at the Century Plaza,” Irving said. We were having coffee in the Polo Lounge one afternoon. He was dressed in a cherry-red turtleneck, high-waisted black slacks, and a black leather bomber jacket. “The Century Plaza is very near where I live. What I ought to do is go there for breakfast one morning soon and try it out. I hate to jump off the deep end without a parachute. But that would mean giving up breakfast here, and I don’t have many left. The days dwindle down, dwindle down to a precious few. Everyone else is moving. The Bel-Air, the Peninsula, the Wilshire, the Hollywood Hilton. But I’m not ready to leave yet.” Irving was in what was for him a lugubrious mood. The day before,another of the pool regulars—Mark Goodson, the game-show producer—had died. (The obituary in the L.A. <em>Times</em>, seeking to explain how Goodson had come by his forty-million-dollar fortune, pointed out that he had “created a plethora of now-familiar television concepts—such as having contestants compete against one another; using the ‘bell and buzzer’ to signal which contestant answered a question first.”) “I never liked Goodson,” Irving said. “He was the only man I knew who could strut sitting down.” But then he added, “Still, I hate to see the regulars dying off. He was only seventy-seven. Pretty soon, who will be left who really <em>knows</em> the pool—who can bridge the gap between the pool’s closing and its reopening? There’s not going to be any continuity at the pool.”</p><p>I had been trying for a long time to get Irving to explain to me exactly how his business worked. “I live on finder’s fees,” he said now. “I’m a middleman—a matchmaker. What I do is to bring people together, and take two per cent. For instance, that gentleman who’s staying in the hotel right now, the Hamburger Hamlet King? Well, I knew that an old friend who had created the entire Hamburger Hamlet concept was ready to sell, and from my network of friends I also knew who might be interested in going into the restaurant business on that scale. It isn’t simply pool people, but the pool people help. I’m a middleman, a matchmaker, an observer. I observe who’s ready to sell and who’s eager to buy.”</p><p>We had made a date for Irving to take me to see a couple of “landmark suites”—the Boesky Suite, where Ivan Boesky had lived, and Suite 100, which was legendary as the place where Ben Silberstein had conducted what Irving refers to as his “extracurricular activities.” But as we were settling the bill Irving said suddenly, “I suppose I ought to tell you that tragic story I started to tell you about, since it’s about my business. Well, it all had to do with the Teamsters. In the early sixties, I was making good money in real estate, and everything couldn’t have been clearer. Then my daughter had the bad luck to make an unhappy marriage to the son of a man who ran the Teamsters’ pension fund. I took out a loan from him to invest in some real estate. It was all completely aboveboard and legal. But then Bobby Kennedy came to believe that he could put pressure on me to turn against my son-in-law and testify to terrible things. So one morning”—Irving was becoming uncharacteristically agitated—“one morning Kennedy came into the Polo Lounge, right here where we’re sitting, during <em>breakfast</em> and shook his finger at me and said, ‘Link, you do as I tell you, or you’ll be in trouble.’ He didn’t even call me <em>Mr.</em> Link—just pointed at me with that finger, and called me Link. So I held that finger, and I said, ‘Mr. Kennedy, I don’t do what <em>anyone</em> tells me.’ He was right, I was in big trouble. Bobby put the I.R.S. on me, and they ended up disallowing two hundred and forty-two thousand dollars in deductions. There was nothing illegal. Things like my son’s bar mitzvah, here in the hotel. They wanted me to testify, you see, and I had to protect my son-in-law. I had never met Hoffa. I was <em>supposed</em> to meet him, once. My son-in-law’s father wanted me to come to Washington and meet Hoffa. So I took a plane out to Washington. But I was troubled by an inner-ear problem in those days, and I got terribly, terribly sick on the plane. I damaged my clothes—a wonderful suit, in linen. When I arrived, he said, ‘I don’t want Hoffa to see you looking like that.’ So I never met him.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“But my business was ruined. The papers picked it up, and, since I wouldn’t testify against my son-in-law, they made it sound as if I belonged to the Mafia. It stopped me dead. People believe what they read. I went from the top to the bottom. But I was never depressed. I’d done nothing wrong. The measure of a man, I think, is how he can accept adversity with dignity. I decided to hold my head high. I still came to the hotel every day. But I often ate at the counter, and I curtailed my gin playing.” By “the counter,” Irving meant the Fountain Coffee Shop, downstairs. “I was eventually reduced to taking a job. My brother-in-law was a liquor distributor, and I joined his business.</p><p>“I was called in front of the grand jury four times. I took the Fifth. I went to visit my son-in-law’s father in jail one Sunday and told him I wouldn’t testify against him. He said to me, ‘You dumb son of a bitch, what more can they do to me?’ Here are the two cheering things that came out of this tragic episode, however. First, the enduring love of my children. Second, the friendship of Charles Z. Smith, one of the prosecuting attorneys. He knew that I was simply protecting my son-in-law. Mr. Smith and I became fast friends after the trial, and he is one of the most charming and delightful gentlemen I’ve ever met. We correspond, and call each other for Christmas. His son and I have actually breakfasted right here in the booth, where Bobby Kennedy pointed his finger at me. Bobby, I believe, always wanted his own way, whether he was right or wrong. You know, he caused me so much strife, but I believe he was sincere. I was watching him in early 1968, and I said to my daughter, ‘You know, I may vote for him.’ She just looked at me.”</p><p>Irving and I left the Polo Lounge, crossed the lobby, and went to look at the Boesky Suite and Suite 100—which turned out to be just hotel suites, from which the aura of power and sensuality had long since fled. We walked back toward the empty lobby, and bumped into Kerman Beriker, the hotel manager, who had just left a farewell party given by the Sultan for the hotel’s employees. “It’s a sad day, but it’s not final,” Beriker said. “Everything will be the same, Mr. Link, I promise you. New rooms, but the Polo Lounge will be the same, the swimming pool will be the same. It’s just—we need a face-lift.” He dropped his voice. “We still have <em>window units</em> in the rooms,” he said, and held his hands out, palms upward, in dismay.</p><p>A steady, melancholy procession of employees poured out of the Crystal Room, where the party had been held. First, a phalanx of Mexican and South American bellhops and maids, each clutching a pink plastic bag with the logo of the hotel imprinted on it. “There’s a present from the Sultan in each bag,” Mr. Beriker explained. Then, after a suitable interval, the royalty of the hotel came out, all in mufti: Sven, Bernice, Chris, Robert the concierge, clutching pink plastic bags that held parting gifts from the Sultan. They gathered around Irving and talked in low voices. (Severance pay had been arranged for most of the senior staff, but no one had been promised a job when the hotel reopened.) Irving looked around the lobby. “Well,” he said, “I have an invitation to a gin game at the Peninsula. But I think— No, I’m just going home.”</p><p>On my last afternoon in the hotel, I went down to have a sandwich at the Fountain. A young black woman, with elegant, aristocratic features, wearing a T-shirt that featured the cast of the classic Warner Brothers cartoons—Sylvester, Tweetie, Bugs, Porky, Yosemite Sam—was having lunch there, too. She was engaged in a conversation with the waitress behind the counter, who looked like a waitress supplied by Central Casting thirty years ago. The young woman gave the waitress a box. The waitress opened it, and exclaimed with delight when she saw that it was full of little sweet-potato pies.</p><p>“Those are <em>good</em> pies,” the young woman said. “I knew you’d like them.” Then she ordered a sandwich. “Jonny,” she said to the waitress, “can I have some ketchup and Tabasco when you come this way? And some chips?”</p><p>“Karen, I’ll have to <em>send</em> for chips,” the waitress said. “I don’t want to give you these I have here.”</p><p>The young woman turned to me. “This is the only decent food in this place,” she said. “Last year, when I was working on my book about my grandfather, I lived over in the Crescent Wing and tried the room service. But it was awful. I’ve been coming here since I was a little girl. My grandfather designed this hotel. His name was Paul Revere Williams, and he did all the Hernando Courtright-period remodelling, back in the forties. The Polo Lounge, the pool, the lobby, this place—all the color schemes and the staircases and the signage. They’re all his. Even the big sign out on Sunset. That’s his, too.”</p><p>The waitress brought over the Tabasco sauce and the potato chips. “This has been a <em>horrendous</em> year for me,” the young woman went on, after introducing herself as Karen Hudson. “All my grandfather’s papers were burned in the riot. This black S. &amp; L. where I work, and that he helped found—it burned right to the ground. So <em>that</em> set me back. But, fortunately, I’ve got lots of other things in the house—his house, where I live, which he designed for my grandmother. It looks like this place, a lot. The curves, the recessed lighting, the inside-outside theme, the color scheme—that was the whole Paul Williams look. He’s just being rediscovered. My book—I’m doing it for Rizzoli—will be the first book about him. It’s funny how people are only just beginning to hear of him. He invented all this—took every straight angle he found in the hotel and turned it round, made it graceful and elegant. But when I called the L.A. <em>Times</em> to get an extra copy of his obituary, they couldn’t find it. They said to me, very querulously, ‘How do you know he <em>had</em> an obituary?’ I said, ‘I know he had two. Because we had them in the family scrapbook.’ He was the first black member of A.I.A. and their first black fellow, too. He was building houses here in Beverly Hills at a time when black people couldn’t even live there. It’s not true that he couldn’t stay here himself—my grandfather would probably have been welcome. He came to the hotel a lot for balls and functions, and so on. But he never wanted to put himself in a position where he could be humiliated. One day when they were creating the pool out there—one of the engineers told me this—my grandfather came out to talk to his crew, and he wouldn’t sit down. They thought, My God, the boss doesn’t want to come and speak to us. It wasn’t that. He would just never put himself in a position where he could possibly be humiliated. That’s why, though he designed hundreds of homes here in Beverly Hills, he would never live in one. Instead, he built his home in a black neighborhood, and always lived deep in the mid-city, in a black community.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“Nobody knows exactly why he got the job. He practiced from 1915 to 1973, in just about every style known to man. He built hundreds of houses around here—he had a completely adaptable, eclectic style. They’re all known, of course, by the pedigree of stars who’ve lived in them. One of my favorite houses that he built is owned by a terrific couple who bought it from Raquel Welch. They’ve got a room with a brass plate on the door: ‘Raquel Welch Memorabilia Room.’ He really designed two masterpieces, though—this place and the house I live in. I’ll take you there, if you like. I’ve tried to keep it unchanged.”</p><p>In Los Angeles, I had got used to jumping into other people’s cars and taking long drives to places I had never seen, so we went upstairs to the lobby, Karen got her car from Chris, and we set off. Along the way, she took me on a compressed tour of her grandfather’s work. He seemed to have designed every second house in Beverly Hills, in a bewildering range of styles: little absurd imitations of the White House; small, graceful bungalows done in a modified Frank Lloyd Wright manner; mini-Monticelli.</p><p>Then we drove south, through miles and miles of low, featureless buildings, and pulled up in a beautiful, palm-lined block that seemed to have been inserted, in one piece, from another, posher neighborhood. I asked Karen what part of Los Angeles we were in.</p><p>“Well, I <em>think</em> this is called Wilshire,” she said. “Until there’s a police disturbance, and then it becomes South Central again.” She led the way to a small, nondescript façade on one corner of the block, and opened the door.</p><p>A small vestibule dominated by a staircase with a curved ironwork railing—rather like the staircase that leads from the ground floor to the pool corridor in the hotel—lay just inside. The railing was wrought in the image of three stags, chasing each other upstairs. On the far side of the staircase lay the living room, with a hearth of agate-colored stone. The right wall was entirely of floor-to-ceiling glass and looked out on a curving, gently terraced, kidney-shaped patio—a doll’s-house version of the Polo Lounge patio, almost down to the last flagstone. The entire interior was orchestrated around a series of graceful S-curves—the curved living room echoing the curve of a green lacquered baby-grand piano, which, in turn, stood in front of a swelling built-in breakfront that filled an entire wall. The colors of the room were all subtly nuanced shades of emerald and moss—a quieter, domestic version of the Beverly Hills Hotel green.</p><p>“Let me show you the Ben Mayer,” Karen said, and opened the breakfront. Inside its doors was a five-foot-long painted mural signed “Ben Mayer” and dated 1951. It showed, in a spirited, cartoonlike style—half Stuart Davis and half Ben Shahn—the story of the architect Paul Williams’ life. A handsome black man in a perfect pin-striped suit, his wife, and their two little girls, in crinolines, filled the foreground. Behind the family was a montage, painted in uneven, shifting perspective, of Paul Williams’ most famous buildings: a Saks Fifth Avenue branch on a boardwalk, a pair of New Orleans-style houses. To the upper right was the sign of the Beverly Hills Hotel, and below were scenes from the hotel itself—the lounge, the awning, the pool. “That was his handwriting,” Karen said, pointing to the cursive writing on the sign, faithfully reproduced in the painting. “He just used it for the hotel.”</p><p>There was a single incongruous note in the mural. Above the beautiful family, a woman was depicted in black underwear, sitting, one leg drawn up, on the edge of a bed. “Ben Mayer put that in for my grandfather,” Karen explained. “He said he put it in because he and my grandfather agreed that prostitutes were the only people they had known who never discriminated against <em>anyone</em>.</p><p>“Before the hotel, my father’s biggest commission was the Al Jolson shrine. It’s this big memorial out at Hillside Cemetery. It’s funny, isn’t it? He made his early reputation commemorating a blackface entertainer.”</p><p>The living room was sunken, and the light came in from small windows facing a garden. I noticed that they were heavily barred. Karen caught me eying them.</p><p>“That’s new,” she said, a little grimly. “We’ve had so many break-ins here. Just this spring, they broke in and stole <em>everything</em>—all my files, all my computers, and, what was worse, the computer disks. They steal them for the programs. That meant that I lost just about the entire manuscript for my book, and I had to start all over again. Oh, it’s been a horrendous year. The fire broke my heart. The S. &amp; L. where I worked was the oldest black-owned-and-operated S. &amp; L. in the city. My other grandfather, my paternal grandfather, opened it in 1947, and brought Paul Williams on at the beginning. In the Watts riot, back in ’65, everybody knew that it was a black institution, so it was left untouched. But not this time. It burned right to the ground that first night, with all the papers in it. I’ve just had to write a new statement for our calendar.” She handed me the calendar. It read, in part, “Broadway Federal emerged from the ashes rededicated to the principles upon which it was founded. Fiercely committed to the belief in South Central and its viability for business, while understanding the importance of home ownership . . . Strengthened by your trust and support, we found many bright lights amidst the rubble.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Karen showed me around the upstairs rooms, which were simpler in décor—a big Frank Lloyd Wright desk, a handsome faceted-glass chandelier—but had the same signature lulling rhythm of curves and recesses. “He lived here in such happiness with my grandmother,” Karen said. “He was entirely filled with her. At work, he was a martinet, but around here all you ever heard him say was ‘Yes, dear.’ It moves me, because he usually worked in whatever style his clients wanted. But this style was obviously his real style—it was the style he loved. It’s so funny—his most public building is done in this style, and his most private building is, too.”</p><p>I’d promised to say goodbye to Irving, and I was already late, so Karen drove me back to the hotel. As we turned the corner onto Wilshire Boulevard, I noticed, for the first time, that everything on the Boulevard looked odd. Not just empty—everything always looks empty in Los Angeles—but unnaturally dark, as though the gas stations and shopping centers had been crudely overprinted in woodcut.</p><p>“It’s all still burned,” Karen said softly. “Nothing restored yet. That burned, and that burned, and that burned.” She pointed at the gas stations and supermarkets and little shopping centers; they were, I realized, all charred at their edges. “Can you imagine?” she said, shaking her head. “But the house is still safe, thank God.”</p><p>“And where will <em>you</em> go?” Irving asked me. He was lying on his chaise, all alone by the side of the pool. By now, the weather had passed from unseasonably chilly to just plain cold; I was in a wool suit. Irving seemed impervious to it all; he was stripped to the waist and was peering at the thin, distant, hazy sun with deep satisfaction, as though we were in Hawaii in August.</p><p>When I returned to the hotel, I had asked Irving if he knew that the pool and the Polo Lounge had been designed by a black architect named Paul Williams. “I didn’t,” he said, and he looked shocked. But then he said, “If I looked surprised, it’s because I didn’t know that he had designed all <em>this</em>. You see, I knew the name, because he was the architect of the first house I lived in in Beverly Hills—the one I was living in when I walked over here that morning. I never met the gentleman, but now I realize that my entire adult life has been spent within his precincts.” Irving looked suitably impressed.</p><p>“And where will <em>you</em> go?” he asked again. I realized that he was asking what hotel I would stay in when I came back to Los Angeles, and that, for him, it was an important question. I didn’t know what to say. I vaguely remembered hearing from a friend that there was a nice hotel on a beach in Santa Monica, so I mentioned it.</p><p>“Really!” Irving said, with polite surprise. He considered for a few moments. “Well, why not?” he said, at last. “One of my maxims is ‘Try everything.’ ”</p><p>On the patio, two producers were having what one of them had loudly billed as “the last Beverly Hills Hotel lunch.” Their voices barked out across the empty pool.</p><p>“What do you mean ‘good family’?” one of them was saying. “What does that mean? What. Come on, what? They don’t take drugs, they give money to the poor—what?”</p><p>“I grant you that the expression is clichéd,” the other began.</p><p>I lost track of the conversation. Irving had walked over to the hedge of lime trees, and now he deliberately plucked a lime from a tree, walked back, and handed it to me. “Here,” he said. “Keep this.”</p><p>I put the lime in the pocket of my suit, and brought it back to New York with me. I still have it.</p><p>I spoke to Irving just the other week. “The Hilton turned out to be a pretty crummy place,” he said. “So I’ve moved my entire life over to the Peninsula. Now something quite remarkable has happened there, which seems agreeably unexpected.” He paused. “The entire royal family of Brunei has moved in here, including the Sultan’s brother! I helped them get rooms—there are forty of them already, and eighty more are coming next month—and we’ve become very good friends. They’re delightful, magnificent people. They’ve reassured me immensely about the future of the hotel, even though I’ve never met the Sultan himself. In fact, I’m coming to think that this time away from the pool may even be very invigorating and character-building. When we return to the pool, we may even appreciate it all the more, for having been kept away so long.”&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

I walked into the room, asked Alexa to play “A Sky Full of Stars,” and it just worked. As a product maker, it struck me that this was technology at its best—doing what the customer wants effortlessly, intuitively, and naturally—and I wanted all the technology in my life to work that way. With 600 million Alexa devices now out in the world, the latest advancements in generative AI have unlocked new possibilities—enabling us to reimagine the experience in our pursuit of making customers’ lives better and easier every day.</span></p></span></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>Today, we’re excited to introduce Alexa+, our next-generation assistant powered by generative AI. Alexa+ is more conversational, smarter, personalized—and she helps you get things done. She keeps you entertained, helps you learn, keeps you organized, summarizes complex topics, and can converse about virtually anything. Alexa+ can manage and protect your home, make reservations, and help you track, discover, and enjoy new artists. She can also help you search, find or buy virtually any item online, and make useful suggestions based on your interests. Alexa+ does all this and more—all you have to do is ask.</span></p></span></p></div><div><p><img alt="Echo Show conversation in motion." height="743" role="" src="https://assets.aboutamazon.com/dims4/default/3940e98/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x900+0+0/resize/1320x743!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon-blogs-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8e%2Ff6%2Fb6c5d6d943eea6091686d78a069a%2Finline001-aboutamazon-alexa-alexa-conversational-cx-hiking-reccomendations-1-1600x900.GIF" width="1320"><span></span></p></div><div><p><h2>Alexa+ is easy to talk to.</h2></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>Conversations with Alexa+ feel expansive and natural. Whether you’re speaking in half-formed thoughts, using colloquial expressions, or exploring complex ideas, Alexa+ understands what you mean, and responds like a trusted assistant. It feels less like interacting with technology, and more like engaging with an insightful friend.</span><br></p></span></p></div><div><p><h2>Alexa+ turns talk into action.</h2></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>At the foundation of Alexa’s state-of-the-art architecture are powerful large language models (LLMs) available on Amazon Bedrock, but that’s just the start. Alexa+ is designed to take action, and is able to orchestrate across tens of thousands of services and devices—which, to our knowledge, has never been done at this scale. To achieve this, we created a concept called “experts”—groups of systems, capabilities, APIs, and instructions that accomplish specific types of tasks for customers.</span></p></span></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>With these experts, Alexa+ can control your smart home with products from Philips Hue, Roborock, and more; make reservations or appointments with OpenTable and Vagaro; explore discographies and play music from providers including Amazon Music, Spotify, Apple Music, and iHeartRadio; order groceries from Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market, or delivery from Grubhub and Uber Eats; remind you when tickets go on sale on Ticketmaster; and use Ring to alert you if someone is approaching your house.</span></p></span></p></div><div data-testid="RelatedContent"><p><a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-tech-generative-artificial-intelligence"><img alt="Alexa partner expert logos" height="200" role="" src="https://assets.aboutamazon.com/dims4/default/2016e23/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1688x1125+0+0/resize/300x200!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon-blogs-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc3%2F06%2F6608b1cd46b7947fc2f8918289e2%2Fartifact-expression-2000x1125.jpg" width="300"></a></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>Alexa+ also introduces agentic capabilities, which will enable Alexa to navigate the internet in a self-directed way to complete tasks on your behalf, behind the scenes. Let’s say you need to get your oven fixed—Alexa+ will be able to navigate the web, use Thumbtack to discover the relevant service provider, authenticate, arrange the repair, and come back to tell you it’s done—there’s no need to supervise or intervene.</span><br></p></span></p></div><div><p><h2>Alexa+ is personalized to you.</h2></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>The new Alexa is highly personalized—and gives you opportunities to personalize further. She knows what you’ve bought, what you’ve listened to, the videos you’ve watched, the address you ship things to, and how you like to pay—but you can also ask her to remember things that will make the experience more useful for you. You can tell her things like family recipes, important dates, facts, dietary preferences, and more—and she can apply that knowledge to take useful action. For example, if you are planning a dinner for the family, Alexa+ can remember that you love pizza, your daughter is vegetarian, and your partner is gluten-free, to suggest a recipe or restaurant.</span></p></span></p></div><div><p><img alt="Echo Show Home screen" height="743" role="" src="https://assets.aboutamazon.com/dims4/default/30a6f49/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1125+0+0/resize/1320x743!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon-blogs-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F65%2F78%2Fa2f287624e9e9c796fafe40e9362%2Falexa-home-screen-smart-home-calendar-widget-ui-3.png" width="1320"><span></span></p></div><div><p><h2>Alexa+ is there when you want it, and fades into the background when you don’t.</h2></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>The new Alexa is like having an assistant available to help any time you want—she’s there when you need her, and disappears when you don’t.

Wishing you guys all the luck in the world!  Email in profile in case you wish to chat.</p><p>For all the naysayers, as a fusion startup, targeting the marine market is a good move.  They aren't even the first fusion startup to do so; IIRC Rostoker's group got their first major funding from the NRL. The marine market pays a premium for not having to refuel, and historically emerging energy technologies have early commercialization in ships.  This was true for fission in the 50s and for photovoltaic solar in the 70s/80s.</p><p>Now, sure, they have to make power to be able to sell it.  But to build a reactor, you have to raise funds, and in order to raise funds you have to show that you can make money if you are successful at making power.  Explicitly aiming at a market that might actually pay for overpriced power shows their investors that there may be a valid business case.  That doesn't make fusion happen any easier, but you don't make any reactions without first building a reactor.</p><p>You know, I'm sure these guys could work somewhere getting paid to get more people to click on stuff.  Instead they are taking a risk to do something that might be important.  Make no mistake: fusion founder is a tough gig.  There is no established off-ramp, and many fusion founders find that it's a job that can easily eat your career. I hope their plan B is in order, as well as their prenups and/or wills.  They are going off to fight a dragon that's eaten a lot of other people's careers, relationships and sanity.</p><p>As an aside, it's nice to see someone working on a tokamak actually not being overly optimistic about wall heat flux. It's like somebody actually paid attention to Stacey or something ;)</p></div></td></tr>

Fission works technically, but not practically. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) could power ships, but licensing fission reactors on land is already brutally hard and expensive—doing it for vessels moving between international ports with enriched uranium is nearly impossible</p><p>What makes you think that licensing a fusion reactor will be easier? Safely handling tritium is fantastically more complicated that the fuel of a fission power plant.</p><p>Also, do you plan on breeding your fuel aboard the ship? If no, how do you plan to produce, store the tritium and refuel the ship? If yes, I'd like to know how you are planning to host the massive chemical plant to purify coolant, recycle unburt fuel, separate isotopes, detriatiate water and refuel that comes with your tokamak.</p></div></td></tr>

There's a few companies working on the Tritium fuel cycle technology that are making great progress.</p></div></td></tr>

It's certainly a good idea to find a niche to make market entry easier, but I would guess that reliability requirements are actually higher for ships than for microgrids.  Find some isolated town or island running off flaky diesel generators on shipped-in fuel and negotiate a reasonable SLA.</p><p>This ignores, of course, the bigger problem: making fusion work at all at Q &gt; 1.  If it were me, I'd work on solving that before worrying too much about optimizing market entry.  So far every single fusion effort has failed to clear that hurdle, and any effort on the other parts is wasted if you can't actually make power.</p></div></td></tr>

They'd have a turbine/generator setup driven by the water passing by and use the energy harvested there for filling the tank. Cruise around as long as it takes to nearly fill the tank then return to port (and fill the rest on the way back). There's <i>a lot of</i> oceans where systems like that could cruise around on.

                  <p>Saw that this morning as well, it's awesome. I do think long term especially for grid applications stellarators could be great... note that their design is ~2.7GW I believe. We're talking gigantic traditional power plant size, which the world needs, but the first generation of these facilities will cost multi billions of dollars. Also with the stellarator, doing non planar HTS coils and the associated manufacturing challenge is a very very hard problem.</p>

                  <p>Unlike what the nuclear Navy does today which is directly mechanically link the steam turbine to the propeller... we have the turbine spin a generator that creates a high voltage electric bus, which can than power a motor for propulsion. But you can 'easily' swap out the motor and tap off that HV bus for any other electrical load. Agree with all those other potential applications for mobile power at sea, there's a ton! Even disaster relief after hurricanes sort of thing, if the grid goes down we sail over and support.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/jeff-bezos-washington-post-opinion-1236302292/">https://deadline.com/2025/02/jeff-bezos-washington-post-opinion-1236302292/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43184762">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
	<a href="https://deadline.com/tag/jeff-bezos/" id="auto-tag_jeff-bezos" data-tag="jeff-bezos">Jeff Bezos</a> is exerting more influence over the content of the <em>Washington Post</em> opinion pages, as he announced Wednesday that its editorials will now focus on “defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets.”</p>



<p>
	But Bezos also made clear that alternate views will not appear on the pages.</p>








<p>
	“We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others,” Bezos wrote in a memo to staffers this morning.</p>



<p>
	Bezos also wrote that David Shipley, the opinion editor, is leaving the publication.</p>



<p>
	Bezos wrote, “I offered David Shipley, whom I greatly admire, the opportunity to lead this new chapter. I suggested to him that if the answer wasn’t ‘hell yes,’ then it had to be ‘no.’ After careful consideration, David decided to step away. This is a significant shift, it won’t be easy, and it will require 100% commitment — I respect his decision. We’ll be searching for a new Opinion Editor to own this new direction.”

	</p>

<div data-pmc-adm-ad-id="1234771711">

			Watch on Deadline		</h3>
	
		
	</div>






<p>
	Bezos has owned the <em>Post </em>since 2013, and during the first Trump term, he was a consistent target of the president. As the <em>Post </em>reported critically on Trump’s administration, he threatened Bezos’ Amazon with antitrust action, and the company accused his attacks on its losing out to Microsoft on a lucrative government contract.</p>



<p>
	This time around, Bezos has been praiseworthy of the president, attending his inauguration. Amazon also contributed $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund. Before the election, Bezos also put the kibosh on editorial page plans to endorse in the presidential race, as it was likely to back Trump’s rival, Kamala Harris. </p>



<p>
	In 2023, the Biden-era Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general sued Amazon for antitrust violations. A trial is scheduled for October 2026.</p>



<p>
	Bezos’ action seemed to suggest that, just as Amazon is facing the antitrust litigation, the <em>Post </em>editorial pages will be advocating for less government intervention and regulation.</p>





<p>
	Bezos wrote in his note, “We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others. </p>



<p>
	“There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader’s doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views. Today, the internet does that job.

	</p>




<p>
	“I am of America and for America, and proud to be so. Our country did not get here by being typical. And a big part of America’s success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else. Freedom is ethical — it minimizes coercion — and practical — it drives creativity, invention, and prosperity.”</p>



<p>
	Bezos’ announcement applies only to the opinion pages, not the news side. But it already has raised concerns in the newsroom.</p>



<p>
	Jeff Stein, chief economics reporter for the <em>Post</em>, wrote on X, “Massive encroachment by Jeff Bezos into <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/the-washington-post/" id="auto-tag_the-washington-post" data-tag="the-washington-post">The Washington Post</a>’s opinion section today – makes clear dissenting views will not be published or tolerated there I still have not felt encroachment on my journalism on the news side of coverage, but if Bezos tries interfering with the news side I will be quitting immediately and letting you know.”</p>



<p>
	Bezos’ action follows moves by another billionaire owner of a legacy publication, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/los-angeles-times-endorsement-editorials-editor-resigns-1236156856/" data-type="post" data-id="1236156856">Patrick Soon-Shiong</a>, owns the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>. He has also sought to take more control over the publication’s opinion pages, leading to the resignation of its editorial editor as well as others.</p>



<p>
	Per <strong>The Daily Beast</strong>, former <em>Washington Post</em> executive editor Martin Baron sharply criticized Bezos’ move as one to focus the opinion pages on “those who think exactly as he does.”</p>



<p>
	“Bezos has done personal liberties a disservice by cravenly yielding to a president who shows no respect for liberty — one who aims to use the power of government to bully, punish and crush anyone who is not in his camp, especially the press. There is no doubt in my mind that [Bezos] is doing this out of fear of the consequences for his other business interests, Amazon (the source of his wealth) and Blue Origin (which represents his lifelong passion for space exploration). He has prioritized those commercial interests over The Post, and he is betraying The Post’s longstanding principles to do so.”</p>

ForeverVM is a code execution API that allows you to securely run arbitrary Python code in a
        remote sandbox and get back results.
</p> <p>
Unlike traditional code interpreters, ForeverVM does not have a concept of a  <em>session</em> after which state expires. Instead, ForeverVM uses memory snapshots to swap
        idle machines to disk for as long as you want. This improves scalability and resource usage,
        and means that applications and agents built on ForeverVM don't have to manage session lifecycles.
</p> <h2> How does it work? </h2> <p>
Once you have created a ForeverVM machine, you can interact with it through a REPL (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">read-eval-print loop</a>) interface. ForeverVM will assign the machine to an available worker while it is actively
        in use.
</p>  <div> <p>
When a sandbox is idle, its memory is snapshotted before it is “detached” from the
            worker.
</p>  </div> <div> <p>
As long as the sandbox remains inactive, it only consumes storage space, not compute or
            memory resources.
</p>  </div> <div> <p>
The next time an instruction for the sandbox is received by the API, it is assigned to a
            new worker and resumed from its last snapshot.
</p>  </div> <p>
These implementation details are hidden from the outside world. To applications built on
        ForeverVM, a machine is just a long-lived REPL that is always ready to run code.
</p> <h2> CLI </h2> <p>
The ForeverVM CLI allows you to create machines and start REPL sessions with them. It is
        distributed through major package managers. Source and binaries are also available  <a href="https://github.com/jamsocket/forevervm/releases">on GitHub</a>.

            Chile’s president has declared a state of emergency after an electricity blackout plunged most of the country into darkness on Tuesday, including the capital Santiago.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7la3gss00003b6mx9o89pe9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The outage – in the middle of Chile’s summer, when temperatures in Santiago are around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) – has affected some 8 million homes, President Gabriel Boric said in an address to the nation on Tuesday evening.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7kwu8cj0000356mkqux9263@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The National Disaster Prevention and Response Service said 14 of the country’s 16 regions were impacted by the blackout, which began Tuesday afternoon.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7lbaa0t0004356m99jetuiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Internet and mobile phone services were down across much of the nation and parts of Santiago’s transport network was suspended, stranding commuters, as officials scrambled to restore power.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7lyiya300003b6mrj1y1l8d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            By Wednesday, the government said that 90% of homes and businesses affected by the blackout had had their electricity restored, according to the Chilean National Electric Coordinator.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7lyjoen00043b6m8e2vwdwp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            But Chilean Interior Minister, Carolina Tohá, acknowledged in a news conference that the service still had ongoing problems and that 220,000 customers remain without power. She also added that 100% of public transport services had been restored, and that the state of emergency would be lifted later.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7lyjoen00053b6mna3zw6av@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Tohá also said an investigation had been opened to establish what caused the outage. “One thing is the original failure that the company had (…) and another thing is how that system responds once the incident occurs.”
    </p>

  


    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7lb2da90000356msg8281zu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The National Electrical Coordinator, Chile’s grid operator, earlier said a high-voltage backbone transmission line, that carries power from the Atacama Desert of northern Chile to Santiago in the country’s central valley, had been disrupted, leading to the blackout. It did not say what caused the disruption.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3rp9k0000356me6rmm4f6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            The president said the state of emergency aimed to “guarantee the safety” of citizens as the outage may last into the night. Authorities also announced a curfew in effect from 10 p.m. Tuesday until 6 a.m. Wednesday.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7laa42000043b6mg01ey6uw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Boric blamed the debacle on the electricity companies, saying “it is not tolerable” that millions of people have been affected.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7laowct000f3b6m0d4tlbvr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “We are not going to let this pass and we are going to act firmly against companies that have not risen to the occasion. For this reason, all the necessary investigations will be carried out,” he said.
    </p>

            Tohá said hospitals, prisons and government buildings were switching to backup generators to keep essential services running and that the national gendarmerie force had been deployed on the streets, to maintain security and support the flow of traffic.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7lc4tfa000b356muhzxclwu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            “Our first concern, and the reason for this announcement, is to ensure people’s safety,” she said. “Obviously, this was something no one planned for.”

What ensued was a lengthy investigation that ultimately revealed some unexpected and highly undesirable behavior. This is a story of the complexities of cellular connectivity, the perils of closed ecosystems, and how to debug what you cannot see.<!-- notionvc: 0cbb8223-3cd5-4c29-a5ce-2b0badc516e7 --></p>

<h2>To Live is to Be Connected</h2>
<p>Before going into detail about the sad state of affairs that is the telecommunications industry, it is important to provide some context around why connectivity is so important for large fleets of devices. Sure, it can be frustrating when your phone or laptop is unable to access the internet. Whether it is because your internet service provider (ISP) is having an outage, there is a bug in your device’s network stack, or any other issue, you may not be able to complete essential tasks. However, you can call your ISP, go to a coffee shop and use their Wi-Fi to download a software update, or execute the tried and true “turn it off then turn it back on” strategy. While the lack of connectivity is not convenient for personal devices, it usually is temporary and does not render the device permanently useless.</p>
<p>The same cannot be said for large fleets of devices deployed in hard-to-access locations. Connection failures that require physical intervention can be fatal for a device, as it might be literally inaccessible, or the cost of accessing it may be so exorbitant that it might as well be. Because of this, we, and our customers, go to great lengths to ensure that devices that fail to connect are able to recover gracefully.<!-- notionvc: eb225e09-23f7-49b9-81fc-9fff0d05b5e9 --></p>
<p>For example, Golioth’s Over-the-Air (OTA) firmware update implementation integrates with recommended frameworks for each supported platform, such as <a href="https://docs.mcuboot.com/design.html">mcuboot</a> and <a href="https://espressif-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/api-reference/system/ota.html">esp-idf OTA</a>, to ensure that a deployed firmware update is able to be rolled back in the case of failure to connect. When a firmware update is initiated via the Golioth cloud platform, devices in the field that are currently connected are notified that a new image is available, and those that are not are notified on next connection. The device will then download the new image into flash in a secondary or “candidate” partition. If download and image verification is successful, the device will subsequently mark the new image as the boot image in a “test” mode, then reboot into it. If there is a crash after reboot or the device is unable to connect for a configurable time window, the device will swap the previous image back, reboot, and continue operation as before.</p>
<h2>Signs of Trouble</h2>

<p>Initial reports regarding connectivity issues with the nRF9160 centered around devices that had recently performed OTA firmware updates. It manifested as some devices in a cohort targeted by a deployment successfully downloading the new firmware image, starting an update, then eventually rolling back to a previous version. While this would typically indicate an issue in the new firmware image, it appeared to only be impacting a subset of devices in the cohort. Furthermore, a number of the devices eventually successfully updated to the new image after a handful of retries.</p>
<p>There are three broad categories of issues one can encounter when working with devices on a cellular connection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firmware</li>
<li>Connectivity</li>
<li>Cloud</li>
</ul>
<p>We like firmware and cloud issues because they are domains that we and our customers can, for the most part, control. If something is going wrong on either side of a connection we are typically able to track down and resolve the issue using observability and debugging tooling. Given the correlation of the nRF9160 connectivity issues with recent firmware updates, our immediate inclination was that customers had updated to the latest version of the Golioth Firmware SDK (<code>v0.17.0</code>) and there had been a regression either in our SDK or one of the platform versions it pins (i.e. nRF Connect SDK, Zephyr). However, reports indicated that multiple versions of both our SDK and the nRF Connect SDK were exhibiting the issue.</p>
<p>We started out by attempting to reproduce the behavior using <code>v0.17.0</code>. The nRF9160 development kit is one of our <a href="https://docs.golioth.io/firmware/hardware/catalog/boards/continuously-verified/nrf9160dk_nrf9160">continuously verified boards</a>, meaning that we are constantly running continuous integration tests on it via our <a href="https://blog.golioth.io/how-we-use-allure-report-to-understand-continuous-integration-tests/">hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) infrastructure</a>. In fact, the history of firmware update test statuses for the nRF9160DK are available on our <a href="https://golioth.github.io/allure-reports/main">public dashboard</a>. However, after running a large number of firmware updates across a variety of geographic locations, we observed an issue that exhibited in a manner similar to the received reports. After downloading a new firmware image, devices would report an inability to resolve the <a href="http://coap.golioth.io/"><code>coap.golioth.io</code></a> domain name to an address, then subsequently rollback to the previous image.</p>

<p>When I said there were three broad categories of issues with cellular devices, I probably should have split the first, firmware, into two separate domains. We like solving problems in the application domain, but a large portion of the firmware running on a cellular device resides in the <em>modem</em>.</p>
<h2>Secret Handshakes and Back Alleys</h2>
<p>In some cases, there is some limited access to firmware on a modem. For example, we <a href="https://blog.golioth.io/golioth-can-now-run-entirely-on-qualcomm-modems/">recently announced</a> support for running Golioth on modem processors. However, even when limited access is available, it typically depends upon encrypted binary blobs, new versions of which are distributed at the whim of the silicon vendor. The nRF9160 modem falls into the category of lesser access, though we are fortunate enough to be blessed with <a href="https://nsscprodmedia.blob.core.windows.net/prod/software-and-other-downloads/dev-kits/nrf9160-dk/release_notes_modemfirmware/mfw_nrf9160_1.3.7_release_notes.txt">moderately detailed release notes</a> when a new firmware version is available.</p>
<p>But before you go egging the Nordic Semiconductor headquarters, consider the fact that they are one of the most open vendors in the industry. They invest heavily in the Zephyr RTOS ecosystem, open source the vast majority of their SDK, provide better developer tooling than their competitors, and are generally fairly responsive on their public forums. Let this blog post not be a slandering of their fine handiwork.</p>
<p>No, Nordic is merely a participant in a vast ecosystem that convenes via the 3rd Generation Partnership Project, or 3GPP as it’s known among friends. 3GPP was formed in 1998 out of the joining of seven different standards organizations — queue the <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">xkcd meme</a>. 3GPP develops the standards that underpin all wireless communication in the world today. These technical specifications (TS) are aggregated and included in “releases”, which are made freely available. Unfortunately, much of the technology that is <em>required to implement the standards</em> is patented. The patents are referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_patent">Standards Essential Patents</a>, or SEPs. Because of this arrangement, a vendor like Nordic probably can’t open source their modem firmware even if they wanted to.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if some brave soul was willing to painstakingly navigate the deluge of 3GPP specifications, they would be able to get an idea of what a modem and the cellular networks it connects to <em>should</em> be doing by reading through the hundreds of documents. In the case of the nRF9160, the primary specifications of interest would be part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_Advanced#LTE_Advanced_Pro">3GPP Release 13</a>, which introduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE-M">LTE Cat-M1</a> (eMTC) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrowband_IoT">NB-IoT</a>.</p>
<h2>Figuring Out What Is Going On</h2>
<p>Prior to my divergence into the morass of intellectual property that provides the foundation of wireless communication, we had just observed that DNS requests were successful when issued via the Zephyr network shell. That felt like a good place to probe deeper, given that we clearly had an internet connection and were simply unable to use it.</p>
<p>The firmware used for testing was the Zephyr <code>fw_update</code> <a href="https://github.com/golioth/golioth-firmware-sdk/tree/main/examples/zephyr/fw_update">example</a> in the Golioth Firmware SDK. The Golioth Zephyr CoAP client implementation <a href="https://github.com/golioth/golioth-firmware-sdk/blob/e97dae07c5af785497089baebb4957c22478cbf5/src/coap_client_zephyr.c#L975">uses</a> <code>zsock_getaddrinfo</code> to resolve the server domain name (<code>coap.golioth.io</code>) to an IP address.</p>

<pre data-enlighter-language="c">ret = zsock_getaddrinfo(host, port, &amp;hints, &amp;addrs);
if (ret &lt; 0)
{
    LOG_ERR("Fail to get address (%s %s) %d", host, port, ret);
    return -EAGAIN;
}</pre>
<p>We could see the error log emitted on failure in the output of our reproduction. When using nRF91 series devices, <a href="https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/libraries/modem/nrf_modem_lib/nrf_modem_lib_socket_offloading.html">socket offloading</a> must be enabled for LTE connectivity.

<p>The initialization function then calls <code>socket_offload_dns_register</code>, to setup the corresponding offload implementations for <code>getaddrinfo</code> and <code>freeaddrinfo</code>.</p>

This is <em>not</em> the modem firmware, but rather the interface from the application processor to the modem firmware. It’s a shame that they don’t provide the source, but disassembling the binary mostly just shows performing some sort of inter-processor RPC with the modem.</p>

<p>This is ultimately where the error on the application processor originates, but the issue is only being propagated from the modem. At this point we turned our attention to the <code>net dns</code> handler in the network shell, which appeared to be communicating with the modem via another mechanism. Sure enough, following the call stack <a href="https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/8748a056f0d8b8aa15f6c9203c34a1849960f1bf/subsys/net/lib/shell/dns.c#L182">from <code>cmd_net_dns_query</code></a> revealed a <a href="https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/8748a056f0d8b8aa15f6c9203c34a1849960f1bf/subsys/net/lib/dns/resolve.c#L1233">call to <code>zsock_sendto</code></a>, notably with the server address provided.</p>

<pre data-enlighter-language="c">ret = zsock_sendto(sock, buf, len, 0, server, server_addr_len);</pre>
<p>The implementation is defined in the <a href="https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/blob/859caae972f33e147649af67aea71e00c35006a2/lib/nrf_modem_lib/nrf9x_sockets.c#L1014">offloaded sockets vtable</a>.</p>

<pre data-enlighter-language="c">static const struct socket_op_vtable nrf9x_socket_fd_op_vtable = {
    .fd_vtable = {
        .read = nrf9x_socket_offload_read,
        .write = nrf9x_socket_offload_write,
        .close = nrf9x_socket_offload_close,
        .ioctl = nrf9x_socket_offload_ioctl,
    },
    .bind = nrf9x_socket_offload_bind,
    .connect = nrf9x_socket_offload_connect,
    .listen = nrf9x_socket_offload_listen,
    .accept = nrf9x_socket_offload_accept,
    .sendto = nrf9x_socket_offload_sendto,
    .sendmsg = nrf9x_socket_offload_sendmsg,

    .getsockopt = nrf9x_socket_offload_getsockopt,
    .setsockopt = nrf9x_socket_offload_setsockopt,
};</pre>
<p><code>nrf9x_socket_offload_sendto</code> then calls <code>nrf_sendto</code>, which takes us back into the binary modem library. The key difference between these paths is that the former asks the modem to perform a DNS request on its behalf, while in the latter, the DNS request is formed, then the modem is asked to send the request to the specified server. In this case, the server happens to be Cloudflare’s <code>1.1.1.1</code> , which is <a href="https://github.com/golioth/golioth-firmware-sdk/blob/e97dae07c5af785497089baebb4957c22478cbf5/examples/zephyr/common/Kconfig.defconfig#L23">set as the default</a> in the Golioth Firmware SDK for Zephyr examples.</p>
<p>At this point, we considered whether there could be a bug in the modem firmware. We had already reached out Nordic, but we needed to move quickly to address the issue. Unfortunately, we were unable to disassemble the encrypted modem firmware binary that Nordic distributes, and dumping the unencrypted firmware proved difficult. We quickly tested a few different versions of the modem firmware to ensure that the behavior had not been corrected in a newer version. The issue reproduced intermittently across all of them.</p>
<p>Perhaps there was an issue with the DNS server used by the modem? This raised the question of how the modem was deciding upon a DNS server to use in the first place. We discovered the <code>nrf_setdnsaddr</code> function in the modem library, which provided some <a href="https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrfxlib/blob/85954588939b0d6c46a84ae39ef7926cc2fe9810/nrf_modem/include/nrf_socket.h#L1124C1-L1130C37">interesting documentation</a>.</p>

<pre data-enlighter-language="c">/**

<p>Maddeningly, it worked. Given the behavior was intermittent, we made sure to test repeatedly, but the device connected every time. Suddenly we had the only thing worse than no solution: a solution that you don’t understand. Hardly comfortable recommending this as a generic workaround to our customers, our pursuit continued.</p>
<p>Curious as to what the modem considered its primary and secondary DNS server addresses, we began pouring through the AT commands supported by the nRF91 series. The <a href="https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ref_at_commands/page/REF/at_commands/packet_domain/cgcontrdp.html">PDN connection dynamic parameters</a> (<code>AT+CGCONTRDP</code>) command returns information about an active Packet Data Network (PDN) connection, including fields described as primary and secondary DNS. After removing the <code>nrf_setdnsaddr</code> call, we added the following immediately after successful LTE registration.</p>

<pre data-enlighter-language="c">err = nrf_modem_at_cmd(at_resp, sizeof(at_resp), "AT+CGCONTRDP=0");
if (err)
{
    LOG_WRN("nrf_modem_at_cmd failed. errno: %d", err);
    return -1;
}
LOG_INF("%s", at_resp);</pre>
<p>The first test was successful and revealed <code>8.8.8.8</code> and <code>8.8.4.4</code> as primary and secondary DNS servers respectively.</p>

<h2>You Can Just Read Stuff</h2>
<p>Remember our good friends at 3GPP and all of their wonderful specifications? It turns out that the aforementioned theoretical brave souls who operate outside of the telecom companies and silicon vendors, but venture into the specification mines nonetheless, are not so theoretical. You can find us at the bottom of the <em>r/telecom</em> Reddit threads where someone is claiming that “carrier standards are so complex that you couldn’t hope to understand them even if you tried”.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the 3GPP release that introduced the technology supported by the nRF91 series modems is Release 13. Specifications across releases are organized into <a href="https://www.3gpp.org/specifications-technologies/specifications-by-series">series</a>. For example, <a href="https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/workprogram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=62371">3GPP TS 36.331 version 13.17.0 Release 13</a>, is a 3GPP technical specification (TS) in series 36 (LTE (Evolved UTRA), LTE-Advanced, LTE-Advanced Pro radio technology), with ID 331. It is under <a href="https://portal.3gpp.org/ChangeRequests.aspx?q=1&amp;specnumber=36.331">change control</a>, meaning that new versions may be released and included in subsequent releases. Version 13.17.0 was the final iteration included in 3GPP Release 13.</p>
<p>This specific TS is entitled “<em>LTE; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification</em>” — really roles off the tongue. Radio Resource Control (RRC) is the protocol used for signalling between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_equipment">User Equipment (UE)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENodeB">E-UTRAN Node B (Evolved Node B, eNodeB, eNB)</a>. To greatly simplify for our specific use case, the nRF9160 device is serving as the UE and the cell towers it attempts to connect to can be thought of as the eNodeB. We start with TS 36.331 because before the device can communicate with the network, it needs to communicate with towers, and it will use RRC to do so.</p>
<p>Once again giving credit to Nordic where it is due, they offer a terrific <a href="https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrfxlib/nrf_modem/doc/modem_trace.html">modem trace</a> feature on the nRF91 series devices. A firmware application can be configured to <a href="https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/cellular-iot-fundamentals/lessons/lesson-7-cellular-fundamentals/topic/lesson-7-modem-trace/">forward trace data</a> from the modem core over UART or RTT, or write it to flash or RAM. The binary modem trace data can be <a href="https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrfutil/page/nrfutil-trace/guides/tracing_converting_data.html">converted</a> into multiple formats, including a <a href="https://pcapng.com/">PcapNG (PCAP Next Generation)</a> file that can be opened in <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>. Furthermore, the <code>nrfutil</code> <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Util">tool</a> enables live capturing from UART to Wireshark with the following command.</p>

<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">nrfutil trace lte --input-serial-port &lt;serial port&gt; --output-wireshark &lt;/path/to/wireshark/binary&gt;</pre>
<p>The first set of RRC messages we observed in the modem trace were <code>SystemInformationBlockType1</code>. According to TS 36.331: <em><code>SystemInformationBlockType1</code> contains information relevant when evaluating if a UE is allowed to access a cell and defines the scheduling of other system information (page 265)</em>.</p>

<p>Section 5.2.2.7 of TS 36.331 provides the logic for evaluating whether the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) is a candidate for a given UE. After evaluating candidacy and receiving all necessary system information, the UE will send an <code>RRCConnectionRequest</code>, which the E-UTRAN will respond to with an <code>RRCConnectionSetup</code> message.</p>

<pre data-enlighter-language="generic">37	7.729614			LTE RRC UL_CCCH	30	RRCConnectionRequest
38	7.772034			LTE RRC DL_CCCH	74	RRCConnectionSetup</pre>
<p>These messages between the UR and the E-UTRAN are referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_stratum">Access Stratum (AS)</a> signalling. After the connection is established, the UE is then able to communicate with the Evolved Packet Core (EPC). Messages between the UE and the EPC are referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-access_stratum">Non-Access Stratum (NAS)</a> signalling. Perhaps the most helpful overview of this architecture is buried in <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/136400_136499/136401/13.02.00_60/ts_136401v130200p.pdf">3GPP TS 36.401 version 13.2.0 Release 13</a>, entitled <em>“LTE; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); Architecture description”</em>, in Section 5.3.</p>

<p>NAS messages may be piggybacked on AS messages, and you’ll also note the presence of the Evolved Packet System (EPS) Mobility Management (EMM) and Session Management (ESM) protocols on top of the Non-Access Stratum. We saw both appear in the next communication.<!-- notionvc: 14f374d7-e328-44aa-8ac6-12f3827cab09 --></p>

<p>The <code>Attach request</code> is an EMM message, while the <code>PDN connectivity request</code> is an ESM message, and both are encapsulated in the <code>RRCConectionSetupComplete</code> message sent by the UR. To understand the structure of NAS messages, we have to look at, you guessed it, another 3GPP TS. This time is it <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/124300_124399/124301/13.12.00_60/ts_124301v131200p.pdf">3GPP TS 24.301 version 13.12.0 Release 13</a>, entitled <em>“Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS); LTE; 5G; Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) protocol for Evolved Packet System (EPS); Stage 3”</em>. I promise I’m not making these names up. The <code>PDN connectivity request</code> is, according to the specification, sent by the UE to the network to initiate establishment of a Packet Data Network (PDN) connection (Section 8.3.20). It includes a variety of parameters, which which we were able see when expanding the data in Wireshark.</p>

<p>The vast majority of them fall under <code>Protocol Configuration Options</code> (PCO). Thankfully there is some information about these options in Section 9.9.4.11 of TS 24.301. It reads:</p>
<p><em>See subclause 10.5.6.3 in 3GPP TS 24.008.</em></p>
<p>You’ve got to be kidding me. We’ll skip the big reveal and jump right to the description in <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/124000_124099/124008/13.13.00_60/ts_124008v131300p.pdf">TS 24.008</a>.</p>
<p><em>The purpose of the protocol configuration options information element is to:</em></p>

<li><em>transfer external network protocol options associated with a PDP context activation, and</em></li>
<li><em>transfer additional (protocol) data (e.g. configuration parameters, error codes or messages/events) associated with an external protocol or an application.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>A Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context is the connection over which the UE can send packets to the network. The options that immediately stuck out when investigating our DNS issue was the presence of the <code>DNS Server IPv4 Address Request</code> and <code>DNS Server IPv6 Address Request</code>. In the <code>PDN connectivity request</code>, these indicate that the UE is requesting these addresses from the network. We can see the response in the <code>Attach accept</code> message which includes an <code>Activate default EPS bearer context</code> ESM message.</p>

<p><code>8.8.8.8</code> and <code>8.8.4.4</code> are Google’s primary and secondary DNS server addresses and matched what we already observed in the output from the <code>AT+CGCONTRDP</code> AT command. The nRF9160 was able to successfully resolve DNS and connect to the Golioth cloud platform after completing this attach procedure. However, upon rebooting and capturing another modem trace, the device failed DNS and the sequence of messages revealed a few differences.</p>
<p>First of all, the SIB messages were post-fixed with <code>-NB</code>, indicating we were receiving system information from an NB-IoT E-UTRAN rather than LTE Cat-M1.</p>

<p>Rather than Procotol Configuration Options (PCO), there were Extended Protocol Configuration Options (ePCO). They are defined in Section 9.9.4.26 of TS 24.301.</p>
<p><em>The purpose of the extended protocol configuration options information element is to:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>transfer external network protocol options associated with a EPS bearer context activation, and</em></li>
<li><em>transfer additional (protocol) data (e.g. configuration parameters, error codes or messages/events) associated with an external protocol or an application.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds pretty similar to PCO. Looking at one more specification, <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/129200_129299/129274/13.13.00_60/ts_129274v131300p.pdf">3GPP TS 29.274 version 13.13.0 Release 13</a>, entitled <em>“Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS); LTE; 3GPP Evolved Packet System (EPS); Evolved General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Tunnelling Protocol for Control plane (GTPv2-C); Stage 3”</em> , states the following in Section 7.2.1 Note 15.</p>
<p><em>An MME, SGW and PGW which supports NB-IoT and/or Non-IP PDN type shall support ePCO. A UE supporting NB-IoT access and/or Non-IP PDN type also support ePCO.</em></p>
<p>GTP is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPRS_Tunnelling_Protocol">GPRS Tunnelling Protocol</a>, and GTP-C is the “control” section. LTE uses GTPv2, which is described as follows on the Wikipedia page.</p>
<p><em>The eGTP-C (or, GTPv2-C) protocol is responsible for creating, maintaining and deleting tunnels on multiple Sx interfaces. It is used for the control plane path management, tunnel management and mobility management. It also controls forwarding relocation messages; SRNS context and creating forward tunnels during inter LTE handovers.</em></p>
<p>Looking back at the diagram from TS 36.401, GTPv2 is the protocol that allows communication between the E-UTRAN and the EPC. That traffic is not observable from the modem trace, but TS 29.274 tells us that both the UE and the entities that make up the EPC must support ePCO when using NB-IoT. We already observed the UE support in the <code>PDN connectivity request</code>, and the accept and activate response was received shortly after.</p>

<h2>What Went Wrong</h2>
<p>At this point everything was starting to make sense.</p>
<ul>
<li>When using the nRF9160 modem for LTE connectivity, offloaded sockets must be enabled, which forces the use of offloaded DNS resolution.</li>
<li>The nRF9160 modem firmware was using PCO for LTE Cat-M1 networks and ePCO for NB-IoT.</li>
<li>When a DNS server address was provided, either via PCO or ePCO, by the network, the offloaded DNS functionality in the modem firmware would always use it as the first option.</li>
<li>If a DNS server address was not provided by the network, the offloaded DNS resolution would fail to resolve unless a fallback was explicitly set with <code>nrf_setdnsaddr</code>.</li>
<li>Some NB-IoT networks are not compliant with 3GPP specifications, leading to DNS failures when using nRF91 series modem firmware.</li>
</ul>
<p>So who is to blame for this state of affairs? The network provider seems to not be implementing the specification correctly, which certainly is not great. However, Nordic also does not fail gracefully in this scenario or document the possibility of its occurrence. In our investigation, we discovered a plethora tickets on their <a href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/">DevZone</a> forum detailing issues with DNS on nRF91 series modems. Most of the threads either fizzled out without resolution, or there was a suggestion to set <code>CONFIG_LEGACY_PDN_PCO=y</code>, <a href="https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-1.9.0/page/kconfig/CONFIG_PDN_LEGACY_PCO.html">completely disabling the use of ePCO</a>, which may cause issues in the event that ePCO <em>is</em> supported. In our testing, ensuring that a secondary DNS address is always configured via <code>nrf_setdnsaddr</code> appears to be a more reliable option.</p>
<p>However, I would argue that the details of this specific issue are not the root of the problem. The root of the problem is an ecosystem that is built on secretive, proprietary technology and complex specifications that even the people involved in writing them have trouble implementing. While some of us may have a strange obsession with combing through 3GPP documents, that shouldn’t be a prerequisite for a company to build a reliable cellular-enabled product. The root of the problem is that, even though we have performed a thorough investigation, tested extensively, and communicated with vendors about the issue, we are still guessing because the modem firmware is closed source and the mobile network operator (MNO) infrastructure is opaque.</p>

<h2>A Call for Change</h2>
<p>You may say this is the way it has always been, or that if you want something to change you better be ready to hire a small army of lawyers. We prefer a more optimistic, though perhaps naive, outlook.</p>
<p>The reality is that the most effective way to inspire change in a commercial context is to appeal to a major player’s self-interest. As previously noted, modem designers like Nordic may have limited control over which parts of the modem firmware can be open source and which cannot. However, given their embrace of open source application firmware, it is clear that they recognize the benefits of both building an ecosystem and allowing customers and other organizations to contribute.</p>
<p>For Nordic and other vendors like them, open source is not only the best thing for their customers, it is the best thing for their business. The same is true for MNOs and MVNOs. The number one reason we see customers opt to not use cellular when another connectivity option is on the table is due to concerns around cost and reliability. Because telecom is a heavily regulated industry, utilizing cellular connectivity when building a product almost always requires taking a dependency on a third party. In order to serve your customers well, you need to have a relationship with your vendors that is based on trust. Transparency is a foundational building block of trust, and vendors that are willing to embrace that will be able to differentiate in the market.</p>
<p>Until then, you can find us combing through 3GPP specifications and reverse engineering their infrastructure to ensure that our customers are able to build cellular-enabled devices with confidence.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Automattic is facing a class action lawsuit over its feud with WP Engine, with a cybersecurity expert accusing CEO Matt Mullenweg of waging “nuclear war” against the hosting company at the expense of hundreds of thousands of its customers.</p>



<p>Ryan Keller, who runs Ohio-based cybersecurity business SecureSight, has filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of WP Engine customers in the United States. The complaint alleges that Automattic deliberately sabotaged WP Engine’s business by blocking access to critical WordPress.org services, causing disruption, security risks, and financial harm.</p>



<p>The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, accuses Automattic of multiple counts of tortious interference and violations of California’s Unfair Competition Law. Keller is seeking financial damages for affected businesses and a permanent injunction to prevent Automattic from using its control over WordPress.org to interfere with competitors.</p>



<p>The class action covers all WP Engine customers in the U.S. who had active hosting plans between September 24, 2024, and December 10, 2024, a period when WP Engine lost access to plugin updates, security patches, and other essential services. The lawsuit claims that “hundreds of thousands” of WP Engine customers were affected.</p>



<p>Keller has retained two class action law firms—Schubert Jonckheer &amp; Kolbe, based in San Francisco, and Tycko &amp; Zavareei, which has offices in California and Washington, D.C. Schubert Jonckheer &amp; Kolbe’s most significant tech-related case resulted in a $22.5 million settlement for AdWords advertisers who alleged Google placed their ads on low-quality parked domains and error pages in violation of California law, benefiting approximately 1.1 million class members. In the past year, Tycko &amp; Zavareei has won class action cases against Apple and Meta, securing a combined $72.5 million in settlements.</p>



<p>Mullenweg has publicly defended his actions in recent months, arguing that he acted to protect WordPress and safeguard its long-term future. In his keynote address at WordCamp US 2024, Mullenweg accused WP Engine and its private equity backer, Silver Lake, of exploiting WordPress without giving enough back to the open source project. It was later revealed that Automattic had demanded that WP Engine pay an 8% licensing fee to use the WordPress trademarks.</p>



<p>But Keller’s lawsuit argues that Mullenweg weaponized his control over WordPress.org, cutting off WP Engine’s access to cripple its business and steer customers toward Automattic-owned hosting brands, including WordPress.com and Pressable. The complaint claims Automattic and Mullenweg publicly pressured WP Engine customers to leave by listing them on the <a href="https://wordpressenginetracker.com/">WordPress Engine Tracker website</a>, while Automattic-owned hosting brands directly solicited them with incentives to migrate.</p>



<p>The lawsuit describes Automattic and Mullenweg’s conduct as an abuse of the open-source internet architecture, alleging that “a single individual (Matt Mullenweg) exercises apparent singular control over what they claim to be more than 40% of all websites in the world through his personal website (WordPress.org).” It calls this level of control “an appalling deception” that is “contrary to every conceivable public policy.”</p>



<p>It also disputes Automattic’s justification for blocking WP Engine’s access, arguing that “a trademark dispute, even if legitimate, is not cause for the deliberate sabotage of the websites of innocent third-party individuals and companies who merely used WPE services.” The complaint calls Automattic’s trademark claims a “pretext” for harming WP Engine and its customers.</p>



<p>The lawsuit challenges Automattic’s influence over WordPress.org, arguing that its ability to block WP Engine’s access without oversight exposes a governance issue in WordPress, where a single company can control who has access to critical WordPress infrastructure.</p>



<p>Keller, who pays $3,300 per year for WP Engine’s Scale Plan, says he had to spend time and money managing security risks and considering alternative hosting providers. The lawsuit claims many small businesses were left in limbo, unsure whether WP Engine could provide stable service or if migrating would be worth the cost and disruption.</p>



<p>A case management conference is scheduled for May 22, 2025, in San Francisco before Judge Peter H. Kang, with both sides required to meet and discuss potential settlement options by May 1 and submit case management filings by May 15.</p>



<p><em>The Repository</em> contacted Keller for comment but hasn’t heard back yet.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Conventional self-attention mechanisms incur quadratic complexity, limiting their scalability on long sequences. We introduce FFTNet, an adaptive spectral filtering framework that leverages the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to achieve global token mixing in $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ time. By transforming inputs into the frequency domain, FFTNet exploits the orthogonality and energy preservation guaranteed by Parseval's theorem to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. A learnable spectral filter and modReLU activation dynamically emphasize salient frequency components, providing a rigorous and adaptive alternative to traditional self-attention. Experiments on the Long Range Arena and ImageNet benchmarks validate our theoretical insights and demonstrate superior performance over fixed Fourier and standard attention models.

    <h2><a href="https://adamscherlis.github.io/">Adam Scherlis</a></h2>
    
    <em>2025-01-01</em>

<h2>Floats with just the sign bits</h2>
<p>I've created a new format for encoding real numbers on computers. I'm proud of it! Let's dive in.</p>
<h2>Real number formats</h2>
<p>We have some real value . Could be positive or negative or zero, large or small. How can we store it in a bitstring?</p>
<p>Fixed-point numbers have one bit for the sign of  (positive or negative) and  bits for its absolute value , in binary, with an implied decimal point in some fixed location. (They actually usually use two's-complement instead of representing  directly, but let's not get into that right now.)</p>
<p>Floating-point numbers basically use scientific notation. One bit for the sign of  (positive or negative), some bits for an integer exponent, and some more for the significand. This is more flexible because it maintains constant <em>relative</em> precision instead of <em>absolute</em> precision. Note that the exponent is the floor of the logarithm of the absolute value, , and the significand accounts for the fractional part (mantissa): . (I'm using  and  to mean  and , or  and  if you want to generalize to an arbitrary base.)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_number_system">Logarithmic number systems</a> are similar, but a bit more elegant: instead of separating the integer part of the logarithm from the fractional part and encoding them separately, it's just a direct fixed-point representation of  and a separate sign bit for .</p>
<p>At this point things are getting kind of interesting: we have a sign bit for  and another (inside the fixed-point representation) for . This second sign bit tells us whether the number is large ( or ) or small ().</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_level-index_arithmetic">Symmetric level-index</a> representations go farther, and let you represent truly enormous numbers: they encode the number of times you need to take a logarithm to make  be a reasonable size, as well as what's left over after the final logarithm. Like logarithmic number systems, they have two sign bits, one for  and one for its <em>first</em> logarithm.</p>
<p>But we can do better.</p>
<h2>Introducing the iterated-log format</h2>
<p>Let's describe , a little at a time.</p>
<p>First: is it positive or negative? That's determined by the sign , counting zero as positive. What's left over is the absolute value .</p>
<p>Then: is it large in magnitude or small? Take  and find its sign, . The information left over is .</p>
<p>Then: is it very large-or-small, like -10,000 and +0.0001, or just moderately large-or-small, like 1.3 or -0.8? This is determined by , where . (To elaborate a bit: we're asking about whether  is large in magnitude, because very large-or-small numbers have very positive-or-negative logs, i.e. large ones.)</p>
<p>You can see where we go from here. We define  and take its sign . At this point things are getting a bit abstract, but we can still interpret this sign: positive values indicate that  is extremely large, extremely small, or very close to ; negative values indicate that it's somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Okay, so what's our proposed format? It's essentially just:</p>

<p>So a small positive number begins , a large negative one begins , etc.</p>
<p>This might not seem like enough information to reconstruct the number, but it is: every additional sign restricts the range of possible values, and any level of precision for a given number can be achieved with enough signs.</p>
<h2>Gray code and lexicographic ordering</h2>
<p>Let's stop at three signs' worth of precision for now and see what we have, in order:</p>
<pre><code>-++
-+-
---
--+
+-+
+--
++-
+++
</code></pre>
<p>Well, that's funny! It's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code">Gray code</a>. Cute, but maybe not the most practical.</p>
<p>Let's convert our signs to bits, moving to a standard lexicographic ordering in the process. The rules for this are straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the first bit,  means positive and  means negative.</li>
<li>Every negative sign flips the encoding for subsequent bits</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rounding and padding</h2>
<p>So far, a finite string of sign bits specifies an interval, not a single value.</p>
<p>To fix a well-defined value for every bitstring and handle some annoying fencepost issues, let's specify that:</p>
<ul>
<li>An empty sequence of signs represents zero</li>
<li>If the sign sequence  represents , then  represents ...</li>
<li>...and  represents 
</li>
<li>After converting signs to bits, an extra  is appended, followed by an arbitrary number of zeroes for padding</li>
<li>The all-zero bitstring represents <code>NaN</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This gives us the following values for sequences of up to two signs:</p>
<pre><code>-+ [0 0 1] -2
-  [0 1 0] -1
-- [0 1 1] -0.5
   [1 0 0] 0
+- [1 0 1] 0.5
+  [1 1 0] 1
++ [1 1 1] 2
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the trailing  that we append has a nice semantic interpretation; with infinitely many zeroes appended, it decodes to </p>

<p>which is what we want an empty sequence to represent anyway.</p>
<p>So an alternative prescription, if you like mathematical elegance over efficiency, is to append an infinite string of zeroes and take the limit.</p>
<!-- 
Similarly, \(000\ldots\) in principle represents \(-\infty\), although the lack of a finite-length encoding for \(111\ldots = \infty\) makes this somewhat less useful.

And in addition to \(1000\ldots = +0\), there's also \(0111\ldots = -0\), so we have the usual fencepost ambiguity of infinite decimals. -->

<h2>Code</h2>
<p>The prototype implementation is in a notebook <a href="https://github.com/AdamScherlis/notebooks-python/blob/main/math/iterlog_coding.ipynb">here</a>, warts and all. There's also some bonus math which I might explain in a later post.</p>
<h2>Every 7-bit number</h2>
<p>I know 7 is a weird bit depth, but it's just enough to show off the killer features of this format:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lexicographic ordering</li>
<li>Wide range of values</li>
<li>Symmetric across zero</li>
<li>Any value representable in  bits is representable in  bits</li>
<li>Numbers too large to represent in any float format</li>
<li>Numbers too small to represent in any float format</li>
<li>Numbers extremely close to 1</li>
<li>Exciting fractally-nonuniform spacing of values</li>
<li>Wildly unpredictable precision</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>[0 0 0 0 0 0 1] -2.004e+19728

<p>A venture capital-backed “AI performance monitoring system for factory workers” is proposing what appears to be dehumanizing surveillance of factories, where machine vision tracks workers’ hand movements and output so a boss can look at graphs and yell at them about efficiency.</p><p>In a launch video demoing the product, Baid and Mohta put on a skit showing how Optifye.ai would be used by factory bosses.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The YC deleted video for sweatshop startup Optifye <a href="https://t.co/vCJvm2HTce?ref=404media.co">pic.twitter.com/vCJvm2HTce</a></p>— Adam Lerman (@AdamLerman5) <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamLerman5/status/1894215433366245457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=404media.co">February 25, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>“Ugh, it’s workspace 17. Workspace 17 is the bottleneck. The worst performing workspace here,” one of the bosses says, while watching a video of a man making clothing in a factory. “Hey number 17, what’s going on man? You are in red,” he says. “I have been working all day,” the person playing the worker says. “Working all day?” the line boss replies. “You haven’t hit your hourly output even once today. And you have 11.4% efficiency, this is really bad!”&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s just been a rough day,” the “worker” replies. “Rough day?” the boss says, looking at a calendar full of red days. “More like a rough month.”&nbsp;</p><p>Optifye.ai, launched by Duke University computer science students Vivaan Baid and Kushal Mohta, is backed by Y Combinator, <a href="https://archive.is/GtuTi?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">according to the company’s site</a>. On their <a href="https://archive.is/Qu09c?ref=404media.co"><u>Y Combinator company profile</u></a>, they write that both of their families run manufacturing plants, where they’ve been exposed to factory working conditions since they were children. “I've been around assembly lines for as long as I can remember,” Baid wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Mohta wrote, “My family also runs several manufacturing plants in various industries, which has given me unrestricted access to assembly lines since I was 15.”&nbsp;</p><p>They hope to sell cameras to factory owners to use on assembly lines, their website says, and “use computer vision to tell supervisors who's working and who's not in real-time.”</p><p>Y Combinator deleted its recent Linkedin and X posts congratulating the company on launching.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXex26pUs8TaRaVO2vdq6klwTPae_pOM-aPnusQ-7taTTHHXcV3knsBxpl1boHfEFumrOfXZigYa0kti6H4K0JPvkpEpC3IOlHXj-SnYvPhf1RQ2lSmW0zOxFIo-rv8snT7FOLJF?key=Yrtm75ZzgcMcjAeui5ZPpzJb" alt="" loading="lazy" width="444" height="553"></figure><p>On their Y Combinator profile, Baid and Mohta outline who gets what out of installing micromanaging AI surveillance on assembly lines. Owners gets “accurate real-time factory, line, and worker productivity metrics,” production heads get “line-wise and worker-wise metrics,” shopfloor supervisors get to “identify who/what is causing inefficiency in the line and fix the problem on the go.” For the workers? They get the tantalizing benefit of being “held accountable for good or bad performance.”&nbsp;</p><p>Worker surveillance is already happening across industries. After the rise of remote work, companies started tracking workers’ productivity based on mouse movements, so <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/mouse-mover-jiggler-app-keep-screen-on-active/?ref=404media.co"><u>workers started using “mouse jigglers”</u></a> so they could walk away from their computers and use the bathroom in peace. In Amazon warehouses, workers <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/internal-documents-show-amazons-dystopian-system-for-tracking-workers-every-minute-of-their-shifts/?ref=404media.co"><u>are tracked and punished</u></a> for not meeting grueling expectations and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64384287?ref=404media.co"><u>bathroom breaks are timed</u></a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.oxfamamerica.org/press/press-releases/amazon-and-walmarts-excessive-warehouse-surveillance-erodes-workers-rights-seriously-harms-worker-health-and-safety/?ref=404media.co"><u>more injuries and less safe working conditions</u></a>. Optifye.ai’s approach and pitch, however, stands out because of the way its founders seem to embrace cruelty to workers in the name of productivity.</p><p>Optifye.ai and Y Combinator did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">A demo from Optifye.ai, a member of Y Combinator’s current cohort, sparked a social media backlash that ended up with YC deleting it off its socials.</p>

<p>Optifye says it’s building software to help factory owners know who’s working — and who isn’t — in “real-time” thanks to AI-powered security cameras it places on assembly lines, according to <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/launches/MsF-optifye-ai-ai-performance-monitoring-for-factory-workers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">its YC profile</a>.</p>







<p>On Monday, YC posted an <a href="https://www.optifye.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Optifye</a> demo video <a href="https://x.com/ycombinator/status/1894115085087297921" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on X</a> (and on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7300050840852086786/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>), according to a snapshot saved by TechCrunch.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfTMq-ODhXLtY2JDWikMdXdp6o4jlLkHg5xXTYDREiRWqkcSWBGIgLdQCgQYjZKd2V8GcrW3of_qFAGFUa2We8LRxxKuHu6YHhDqkFZGVPf-Ff3qR5gg3rk4cpOeip04-U_WOMuMA?key=C-bSOu1zTaIchlPR-5L0iKfx" alt=""></figure>

<p><a href="https://x.com/AdamLerman5/status/1894215433366245457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The video</a> shows Optifye co-founder Kushal Mohta acting as the boss of a garment factory, calling a supervisor — in reality his co-founder Vivaan Baid — about a low-performing worker known only as “Number 17.”</p>

<p>“Hey Number 17, what’s going on man? You’re in the red,” Baid asks the worker, who responds that he’s been working all day.</p>

<p>“Working all day? You haven’t hit your hourly output even once and you had 11.4% efficiency. This is really bad,” Baid retorts.</p>

<p>After checking Optifye’s dashboard, the supervisor looks at the output of “Number 17” for 15 days, decides that the worker has been underperforming and calls the worker out on it.&nbsp;</p>


<p>“Rough day? More like a rough month,” he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The clip was heavily criticized on X, where @VCBrags <a href="https://x.com/vcbrags/status/1894454286370709858?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">called it</a> “sweatshops-as-a-service” and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/miranda_nover/status/1894197679447838954">another</a> deemed it “computer vision sweatshop software.” It also <a href="https://x.com/miranda_nover/status/1894197679447838954" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sparked criticism</a> on Y Combinator’s own link sharing site Hacker News.</p>

<p>Not everyone was critical, though. Eoghan McCabe, the CEO of customer support startup Intercom, <a href="https://x.com/eoghan/status/1894412092415017270" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted that</a> anyone complaining better stop buying products made in China and India.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Indeed, it’s not too difficult to find tech companies in China <a href="https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1816116508256549836&amp;wfr=spider&amp;for=pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">touting</a> a “sleep detection” camera that uses computer vision to spot sleeping workers, for example.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Either way, YC ended up deleting the demo video from its socials, but not before it was <a href="https://x.com/archiexzzz/status/1894285551064285449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">saved</a> by <a href="https://x.com/cdolan92/status/1894216778126959027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">several</a> accounts.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Neither YC nor Optifye.ai responded to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The video’s likely unintended virality showcases growing anxieties over the rise of AI, especially in the workplace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most Americans oppose using AI to track workers’ desk time, movements, and computer use, a Pew poll <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/04/20/americans-views-on-use-of-ai-to-monitor-and-evaluate-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found in 2023</a>. This is a segment of surveillance products sometimes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/20/ai-mistakes-bossware/">called “bossware.”</a></p>

<p>That hasn’t stopped VCs from funding the space, though. Invisible AI, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/28/invisible-ai-raises-15m-to-stick-worker-monitoring-cameras-in-factories/">raised $15 million in 2022</a> to stick worker-monitoring cameras in factories, too. </p>

<p>Protests at Tesla stores are gaining momentum across the US as people are fighting back against Elon Musk’s government takeover, and the hate is spreading to owners.</p>



<p>Last week, we reported on a new effort to organize protests at Tesla stores worldwide, but primarily in North America.</p>



<p>There were significant turnouts to disrupt Tesla operations by picketing in front of dozens of stores.</p>



<p>But the movement is ongoing, and there were protests against this weekend and <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/event_campaigns/teslatakedown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more planned for the coming weeks</a>:</p>

<p>Many of the protests from this weekend appeared to be bigger than the last ones.</p>



<p>There was a big turnout at a Tesla store in Seattle that reportedly ended up closing the location:</p>

<p>There were reportedly as many as 200 people who gathered to protest Elon Musk at the Fort Lauderdale store in Florida:</p>

<p>There are dozens of similar examples at Tesla stores all around the US and Canada, and the movement is now spreading to Europe.</p>



<p>These protests have been peaceful, and people are justifying going after Tesla for being Elon Musk’s piggy bank.</p>



<p>However, the growing negative sentiment against Tesla also attracts criminal activities like vandalism, and sometimes against Tesla owners rather the company itself.</p>



<p>Tesla owners, especially Cybertruck owners, have been increasingly reporting animosity from other road users, and in some cases, Tesla vehicles are getting tagged by anti-fascism graffiti.</p>



<p>In one case in California, a vandal put isolating foam into the charge connectors of a few charging stalls, rendering them useless.</p>

	<p>A couple of Supercharger stalls in Utah were graffitied—pictured above. Tesla said that it would remove the graffiti today and that it will “press charges for vandalism at Superchargers.”</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>The blowback is more significant than I thought it would be. I thought things would end last weekend, but not only was this weekend’s protest bigger, but it sounds like now there are more being planned.</p>



<p>I couldn’t confirm if they were indeed able to close the store in Seattle, but if that’s true, that’s also a direct impact on Tesla’s operation.</p>



<p>It’s just sad that some vandals are going after Tesla owners. That’s just stupid to me. A</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">DeepGEMM</h2><a id="user-content-deepgemm" aria-label="Permalink: DeepGEMM" href="#deepgemm"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">DeepGEMM is a library designed for clean and efficient FP8 General Matrix Multiplications (GEMMs) with fine-grained scaling, as proposed in <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3">DeepSeek-V3</a>. It supports both normal and Mix-of-Experts (MoE) grouped GEMMs. Written in CUDA, the library has no compilation need during installation, by compiling all kernels at runtime using a lightweight Just-In-Time (JIT) module.</p>
<p dir="auto">Currently, DeepGEMM exclusively supports NVIDIA Hopper tensor cores. To address the imprecise FP8 tensor core accumulation, it employs CUDA-core two-level accumulation (promotion). While it leverages some concepts from <a href="https://github.com/nvidia/cutlass">CUTLASS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/tree/main/include/cute">CuTe</a>, it avoids heavy reliance on their templates or algebras. Instead, the library is designed for simplicity, with only one core kernel function comprising around <strong>~300 lines of code</strong>. This makes it a clean and accessible resource for learning Hopper FP8 matrix multiplication and optimization techniques.</p>
<p dir="auto">Despite its lightweight design, DeepGEMM's performance matches or exceeds expert-tuned libraries across various matrix shapes.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Performance</h2><a id="user-content-performance" aria-label="Permalink: Performance" href="#performance"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We test all shapes potentially used in DeepSeek-V3/R1 inference (including both prefilling and decoding, but without tensor parallelism) on H800 with NVCC 12.8. All speedup metrics are calculated in comparison to our internally and carefully optimized implementation based on CUTLASS 3.6.</p>
<p dir="auto">DeepGEMM does not behavior very well on some shapes, optimization PRs are welcomed if you are interested.</p>

<p dir="auto">This library exclusively contains GEMM kernels. It requires the LHS scaling factor to be TMA-aligned and transposed, and it only supports the NT format (non-transposed LHS and transposed RHS). For transposition or other FP8 casting operations, please implement or fuse them into prior kernels independently. While the library provides some simple PyTorch utility functions, these may result in slower performance, but our primary focus is on optimizing the GEMM kernels themselves.</p>

<p dir="auto">To perform a basic non-grouped FP8 GEMM, call the <code>deep_gemm.gemm_fp8_fp8_bf16_nt</code> function. For more details, please refer to the function documentation.</p>

<p dir="auto">Unlike traditional grouped GEMMs in CUTLASS, DeepGEMM groups only the M-axis, while N and K must remain fixed. This design is tailored for scenarios where experts in an MoE model share the same shape.</p>
<p dir="auto">For training forward passes or inference prefilling, where each expert may process a varying number of tokens, we concatenate these tokens into a single tensor, referred to as the "contiguous" layout. Note that each expert segment must be aligned to the GEMM M block size (<code>get_m_alignment_for_contiguous_layout()</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">For more information, please refer to the <code>m_grouped_gemm_fp8_fp8_bf16_nt_contiguous</code> function documentation.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Grouped GEMMs (masked layout)</h4><a id="user-content-grouped-gemms-masked-layout" aria-label="Permalink: Grouped GEMMs (masked layout)" href="#grouped-gemms-masked-layout"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">During the inference decoding phase, when CUDA graph is enabled and the CPU is unaware of the number of tokens each expert receives, we support masked grouped GEMMs. By providing a mask tensor, the kernel computes only the valid portions.</p>
<p dir="auto">Use <code>m_grouped_gemm_fp8_fp8_bf16_nt_masked</code> for this purpose and consult the relevant documentation. An example usage is to use the output of low-latency kernels from <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepEP">DeepEP</a> as input.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Utilities</h4><a id="user-content-utilities" aria-label="Permalink: Utilities" href="#utilities"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The library provides some utility functions besides the above kernels:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>deep_gemm.set_num_sms</code>: set the maximum SM count to use</li>
<li><code>deep_gemm.get_num_sms</code>: get the current SM maximum count</li>

<li><code>deep_gemm.get_col_major_tma_aligned_tensor</code>: get a column-major TMA-aligned tensor</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The library also provides some environment variables, which may be useful:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>DG_CACHE_DIR</code>: string, the cache directory to store compiled kernels, <code>$HOME/.deep_gemm</code> by default</li>
<li><code>DG_NVCC_COMPILER</code>: string, specified NVCC compiler path; will find in <code>from torch.utils.cpp_extension.CUDA_HOME</code> by default</li>

All kernels are compiled at runtime using a lightweight JIT implementation. This approach offers several advantages:</p>

<p dir="auto">For certain shapes, block sizes aligned to powers of 2 can lead to underutilized SMs. For instance, with <code>M=256, N=7168</code>, a typical block size assignment of <code>BLOCK_M=128, BLOCK_N=128</code> results in only <code>(256 / 128) * (7168 / 128) = 112</code> out of 132 SMs being utilized. To address this, we support unaligned block sizes like 112, enabling <code>(256 / 128) * (7168 / 112) = 128</code> SMs to work in such scenarios. Implementing this technique alongside fine-grained scaling requires careful optimization but ultimately delivers performance gains.</p>

<p dir="auto">We observe a performance improvement in <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/tree/main/examples/54_hopper_fp8_warp_specialized_gemm">the CUTLASS FP8 kernel</a> between NVCC 12.2 and 12.3. By comparing the compiled SASS, we discover that one bit in <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/eefa171318b79cbe2e78514d4cce5cd0fe919d0c/include/cutlass/gemm/collective/fp8_accumulation.hpp#L73">a series of <code>FADD</code> instructions</a> is flipped in an interleaving pattern.
After referencing some open-source <a href="https://github.com/cloudcores/CuAssembler/blob/master/CuAsm/CuControlCode.py#L46">CUDA assembler</a> implementations, we identified that this bit controls <code>yield</code>, which may enhance warp-level parallelism (just a guess, yielding the current warp and let other warps work).</p>
<p dir="auto">To leverage this, we develop <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepGEMM/blob/main/deep_gemm/jit/interleave_ffma.py">a similar script</a> to modify the <code>FFMA</code> instructions in the compiled binary. Besides simply modifying the <code>yield</code> bit, we also flip the <code>reuse</code> bit (registers cannot be reused if the warp is yielded). This adjustment improves performance (10%+ in some cases) for fine-grained scaling FP8 GEMMs by creating more opportunities to overlap MMA instructions with promotion <code>FFMA</code> instructions.</p>
