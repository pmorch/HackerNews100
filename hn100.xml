            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://sourcehut.org/blog/2024-01-19-outage-post-mortem/">https://sourcehut.org/blog/2024-01-19-outage-post-mortem/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39056902">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>It’s been a busy couple of weeks here at SourceHut. At the time of writing, we
have restored SourceHut to full service following an unprecedented 170 hour
outage, and while we still have numerous kinks to sort out following an
unscheduled emergency migration of all services across an ocean, all services
are now fully operational.</p>
<p>Allow me to open this post-mortem by extending my deepest apologies to the
SourceHut community for this interruption in service. This outcome was
unacceptable: we failed you, and I am sorry. We know that you depend on
SourceHut to be reliable, and you trust us to make sure that you can always
depend on our services to be there for your projects. We value this trust
profoundly, and we will strive to prevent a situation like the one we faced last
week from recurring. The Internet can be a fragile place, and we will do what we
can to re-enforce it.</p>
<p>Here’s what happened, what we did about it, how we’re making things right, and
what we’re doing to ensure it does not happen again.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>SourceHut runs on servers owned and provisioned by SourceHut, installed in
colocation facilities at three datacenters, respectively codenamed PHL, AMS, and
FRE. PHL was our primary datacenter, FRE was used for off-site backups, and AMS
was a research installation intended for a future migration of our production
infrastructure in PHL and next-generation deployment of SourceHut intended to
scale into the indefinite future.</p>
<p>We have been setting up an installation in AMS for researching a future
infrastructure migration to the EU and means of increasing our resilience and
redundancy, which we had planned to gradually roll out with minimal disruption
to user service over the course of at least a year. In the end, we rolled it out
with maximum disruption to user service in 7 days. The AMS datacenter
installation was provisioned according to a projected research workload with an
eye towards expanding it to support a full SourceHut installation in the future;
at the time of the incident it was provisioned at a scale appropriate for
running <em>most</em> of a SourceHut installation.</p>
<p>Our FRE datacenter is used for off-site backups. We maintain a Postgres standby
which is replicated in real-time and is usually up-to-date within seconds of
production, as well as daily backups of large data silos such as git.sr.ht. We
have a comprehensive monitoring system in place which, among monitoring other
systems, keeps track of these backups and notifies us when their metrics fall
outside of our window; for instance we receive an alarm if the database replica
is more than 5 minutes behind production of if large storage backups exceed 48
hours.</p>
<p>We maintain a comprehensive set of operational plans for responding to various
incidents which may arise, ranging from hard drive failure up to and including
the complete failure of a datacenter, which proved to be important when
addressing this scenario. We also have standard response times for responding to
various tolerances being exceeded which are designed to minimize user impact;
for instance we configure the storage utilization alarms with sufficient lead
time to provision additional storage.</p>
<p>The complete failure of a datacenter is the most challenging situation we have
prepared for, and it is the situation with which we were ultimately faced.</p>
<h2 id="the-incident">The incident</h2>
<p>At around 06:00 UTC on January 10th, a layer 3 distributed denial-of-service
(DDoS) attack began to target SourceHut’s PHL infrastructure. We routinely deal
with and mitigate application layer (layer 7) DDoS attacks, however, a layer 3
attack takes place at a lower level and is not within our ability to mitigate
without the assistance of our network provider. Starting from about 06:00, our
monitoring systems noticed that something was wrong and raised the alarm, and we
started investigating the issue shortly thereafter. However, before we could get
a handle on the situation, our access to the PHL network completely disappeared
at around 09:00 UTC.</p>
<p><img src="https://sourcehut.org/january-outage.png" alt="Screenshot of our monitoring system detecting problems"></p>
<div><p>
  We never received any kind of ransom note or other communication from the
  attacker. We do not know who was behind the attack, nor their motivations, and
  likely never will. We know that they targeted SourceHut specifically, and that
  they followed us as we worked on mitigations, directing their attack at new
  infrastructure as it was being set up.</p><p>
  In this post-mortem we are going to focus on the impact on our network and the
  steps we took to restore service, rather than going into what we know of the
  attack and the details of our mitigations, both for information security
  reasons and to avoid lending legitimacy to a bad actor. In the end, the
  response to the attack from our upstream network in PHL did more damage to our
  infrastructure than anything else.
</p></div>
<p>We rent network service in PHL from our colocation provider, who provisions a
subnet out of their AS and routes it through Cogent and Level 3. In response to
the attack, Cogent announced null routes for our downstream AS, causing our
PHL network to become unreachable both for SourceHut staff and the general
public.</p>
<p>We attempted to contact our colocation provider at this point, but we were
unsuccessful. Our provider in PHL has been acquired twice over the past couple
of years, and it seems that the ticketing portal we were used to paging them
with had been deprecated and our account had not been migrated to the new
system. We were unable to reach them until their normal office hours opened at
14:00 UTC. Our provider restored our access to the priority ticketing system and
began to investigate the issue. Eventually they were able to convince Cogent to
reduce the null route from our entire /24 to a narrower /32 focusing on the
specific IP address being targeted by the DDoS. As a result, service was mostly
restored by 18:00 UTC.</p>
<p>At about 06:30 UTC the following morning, the DDoS escalated and broadened its
targets to include other parts of our PHL subnet. In response, our colocation
provider null routed our subnet once again. This subnet has been unreachable
ever since.</p>
<p>At 09:00 UTC, I made the call to perform an emergency migration to AMS and
restore from backups. We began urgently planning the scope of this work, making
an assessment of our backups and the Amsterdam installation’s capacity to host
a fully functional SourceHut installation, and planning the work that needed to
be done. We verified the health of FRE and AMS and our backup systems, finding
that our standby database was less than 30 seconds out of date with production
and that our large storage backups were no more than 12 hours old. We found that
AMS was in good health and we touched up a few research systems (e.g. Ceph) to
bring them to production readiness.</p>
<p>What essentially followed was creating a new installation of SourceHut from
scratch, importing production data, testing and verifying the installation, and
bringing it online for user service on a new DDoS-resistant network. This
involved hundreds of small tasks that we planned out and distributed among
ourselves and executed as urgently as possible, the full details are too
involved to repeat here. However, the general plan had the following broad
strokes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Migrate to external DNS</li>
<li>Bring up a new primary database</li>
<li>Restore backups from FRE to AMS</li>
<li>Migrate object storage from PHL to AMS</li>
<li>Bring up database-only services, such as meta, todo, project hub</li>
<li>Bring up large storage services as backup restores finish</li>
<li>Manually apply the diff between production data and the last backups</li>
<li>Provisioning a new mail system and configuring mail services for it</li>
<li>Identify a suitable DDoS-resistant network to bring us into general service</li>
<li>Provision servers to backfill AMS capacity to production readiness</li>
<li>Test the new systems and bring them into general service</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this work happened in parallel and had cross-dependencies, so from here
on out we will omit some timestamps.</p>
<p><strong>Network solutions</strong></p>
<p>The selection of a suitable network to bring into service that would not
immediately collapse as the DDoS attack followed us presented some challenges.
First, this was a layer 3 attack, which can essentially only be mitigated by
having more bandwidth than the attacker and/or by filtering traffic at a
location suitably far upstream. Furthermore, many DDoS protection systems only
operate at the application layer, namely for the web as the application in
question, whereas SourceHut has user-facing services through not only HTTPS but
also SSH, SMTP, and IRC; moreover we strongly prefer to utilize end-to-end
encryption on all traffic and terminate it on SourceHut-operated infrastructure.</p>
<p>We initially researched a number of solutions, and spoke to CloudFlare in
particular due to their ability to provide a rapid response to ongoing
incidents. However, given our complex requirements, CloudFlare quoted us a
figure which was not attainable within our financial means as a small company.
Other options we researched (though we did not seek additional quotes) had
similar economical constraints. However, we found that OVH’s anti-DDoS
protections were likely suitable: they are effective, and their cost is
amortized across all OVH users, and therefore of marginal cost to us. To this
end the network solution we deployed involved setting up an OVH box to NAT
traffic through OVH’s DDoS-resistant network and direct it to our (secret)
production subnet in AMS; this met our needs for end-to-end encryption as well
as service over arbitrary TCP protocols.</p>
<p>We also got in contact with our network operator in AMS and explained the
situation to them. We found some solutions to mitigate attacks directed at AMS
but we will not disclose details regarding the AMS network for reasons of
information security.</p>
<p>We made some mistakes throughout the operation, rsyncs done incorrectly,
networks misconfigured, and so on. One particularly amusing mis-step occurred
when we configured the NAT through OVH: we naively NAT’d all traffic through to
AMS, and when the attack resumed targeting our OVH infrastructure, the inbound
DDoS was briefly forwarded to AMS before OVH’s mitigations kicked in, which made
our brand new OVH account look like the source of an <em>outgoing</em> DDoS, with
predicable consequences that took some work to resolve with OVH.</p>
<p>Following our initial quote from CloudFlare, we understand that some CloudFlare
employees undertook a grassroots effort internally to convince the leadership to
sponsor our needs, and eventually CloudFlare came back to us with an offer to
sponsor our services for us free of charge. This was a very generous offer for
which we are very appreciative; in the end we did not take them up on it as we
had made substantial inroads towards an alternative solution by that time. I
have had my reservations about CloudFlare in the past, but they were there for
us in a time of need and I am grateful for that.</p>
<p>On January 12th, our network provider in PHL agreed to provision a temporary
subnet through which we could receive out-of-band access to our PHL servers.
We were able to speed up the provisioning of replacement infrastructure thanks
to this being made available.</p>
<p><strong>Provisioning services</strong></p>
<p>Efforts to restore individual SourceHut services came with a variety of
challenges. Some of them were fairly straightforward; services like paste and
the project hub depend only on a working SQL server and once we had that in
place we were able to restore them to service at about 19:00 UTC on January
11th.</p>
<p>git.sr.ht and hg.sr.ht had special considerations due to the large amount of
data they were responsible for. We restored them from backups to read-only
service based on somewhat stale data by 20:00 UTC, and restored to full
read/write service by 11:00 UTC on January 13th. We also did our best with
hg.sr.ht, but it is community maintained and restoring service was delayed until
we could get the community maintainer, Ludovic Chabant, online to help; it was
fully restored at 08:20 UTC on January 15th.</p>
<p>pages.sr.ht also presented unique challenges due to its use of an S3-compatible
object storage solution, which we discovered was not considered in our off-site
backups. However, it was a priority to restore service to bring online the
numerous personal and project websites which depend on pages.sr.ht. Migrating
object storage from PHL to AMS is a slow procedure which is still underway now,
we are running pages through an out-of-band link to PHL which comes with some
performance limitations but provides service while the slower migration process
is underway in the background. Pages also had to be moved to a new subnet and IP
address, which posed a problem for users who configured their apex records to
point directly to the PHL subnet; we have now emailed affected users with
instructions for manual intervention.</p>
<p>chat.sr.ht also poses some unique constraints due to its approach to networking;
for a number of reasons we implement outbound IRC connections on a unique IPv6
address per-user. Preparing the requisite network infrastructure and bringing it
online required special considerations and as a consequence chat.sr.ht was the
last service to be restored to full operation at 10:30 UTC on January 17th.</p>
<p>builds.sr.ht also required some extra considerations due to the fact that our
research installation in AMS was under-provisioned for its compute requirements.
Currently we are running build workers on dedicated baremetal OVH servers and we
are planning to bring build service back onto SourceHut-operated infrastructure
once we are able to ship our builds-oriented compute servers from PHL to AMS in
the coming weeks. We began accepting build jobs again at 18:00 UTC on January
16th.</p>
<p>All told, we began restoring partial service availability on the afternoon of
January 12th, and gradually brought up services over the following days until
full service was restored on the morning of January 17th. Following the
complete restoration of service we credited all paying SourceHut users with 7
days of free service.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>
<p>We have completed all user-facing steps required to restore SourceHut to full
service. However, we have numerous tasks to perform internally to put the
finishing touches on the new installation and to clean up workarounds and hacks
put in place to restore service as quickly as possible. We have an internal
bugtracker with about 60 post-incident tasks to be completed, some of which are
finished and others which are still underway: for instance, we have provisioned
a new standby database, configured backups from AMS =&gt; FRE, and we are working
on installing a new monitoring system.</p>
<p>We are also deprecating our PHL datacenter installation entirely. We still
cannot reach the network there, and the operator has egregiously exceeded their
SLA with us. We will pack up the servers in PHL and ship them to AMS to
supplement capacity there.</p>
<p>Ironically, this emergency migration allowed us to quickly achieve many of the
long-term goals we had in mind for migrating to the EU. We are now running
almost entirely on European infrastructure and we quickly finished bringing many
of our plans to ensure future scalability and reliability of SourceHut
infrastructure to production readiness. We had planned to do these upgrades
without user impact, but, well, alas.</p>
<p>Part of the work involved in setting up the AMS datacenter installation was
geared towards increasing resilience, reliability, and redundancy, and reducing
the impact of attacks and outages of this nature. SourceHut is still in an
“alpha” state, and though we have built a platform that is sophisticated and
depended on by numerous free software projects, that comes with some caveats.
This incident exposed one such caveat, a shortcoming that we were aware of and
actively working on improving, but which was exploited before we could complete
our goals for redundancy and resilience. Our definition of production readiness,
our “definition of done” for the alpha, includes building infrastructure that
prevents this kind of outcome. We have made unexpectedly urgent inroads on these
milestones, and we will continue to build out these solutions as part of our
work to bring SourceHut from alpha to beta to production.</p>
<p>In the service of this work, we have been researching a solution for running
SourceHut in an on-premise Kubernetes cluster (cue gasp from the audience). The
migration to AMS did not involve a migration to Kubernetes, but it did put us in
a better position to expedite that work. We intend to utilize this work to
reduce user-impacting downtime during internal maintenance, such as when scaling
up our infrastructure or upgrading software, but also to improve our resistance
to events such as the one that transpired this week. Once we have completed an
implementation of this solution, we will be planning out a secondary
production-ready datacenter which we can load balance against and which can step
up to take on full service in the event of a datacenter outage, as well as
making it easier to conduct the procedures that we employed this week to stand
up SourceHut from scratch in a new datacenter should the need ever arise again.</p>
<p>As unfortunate as these events were, we welcome opportunities to stress-test our
emergency procedures; we found them to be compatible with our objectives for the
alpha and we learned a lot of ways to improve our reliability further for the
future. We are going to continue working on our post-incident tasks, building up
our infrastructure’s resilience, reliability, and scalability as planned. Once
we address the high-priority tasks, though, our first order of business in the
immediate future will be to get some rest.</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>I’d to acknowledge those who helped us in this difficult time. Of course, I
extend my thanks to the rest of the staff, Simon and Conrad, whose long hours of
work ensured we could restore service for our customers as quickly as possible.
I would also like to thank the staff and network operators at our various
datacenter locations, for their role in facilitating our needs in the rapid
bring-up of new infrastructure. Thanks especially to the community members who
sent us their words of support and kindness, and offers of aid, via email,
Mastodon, on IRC, and so on.</p>
<p>Thanks are also due to our peer in the free-software-forge space, Codeberg. They
hosted our status page prior to the incident, and likely faced their own DDoS
attack in retaliation for the services they provided to us. We shared
information across our teams extensively and their communication and
relationship with SourceHut has always been superb.</p>
<p>I’d also like to thank the team at CloudFlare; though we did not accept your
generous offer we were appreciative that you were there for us in a time of
need.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I would like to thank my fiancé for their patience and
unwavering emotional support during a challenging time.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your patience and support.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>A Canadian man who says he’s been falsely charged with orchestrating a complex e-commerce scam is seeking to clear his name. His case appears to involve “triangulation fraud,” which occurs when a consumer purchases something online — from a seller on <strong>Amazon</strong> or <strong>eBay</strong>, for example — but the seller doesn’t actually own the item for sale. Instead, the seller purchases the item from an online retailer using stolen payment card data. In this scam, the unwitting buyer pays the scammer and receives what they ordered, and very often the only party left to dispute the transaction is the owner of the stolen payment card.</p>
<div id="attachment_32692"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32692" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/triangulationfraud.png" alt="" width="637" height="349" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/triangulationfraud.png 637w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/triangulationfraud-580x318.png 580w" sizes="(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-32692">Triangulation fraud.

<p><strong>Timothy Barker</strong>, 56, was until recently a Band Manager at <a href="https://www.duncansfirstnation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duncan’s First Nation</a>, a First Nation in northwestern Alberta, Canada. A <a href="https://www.fnha.ca/Documents/Band_Manager.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Band Manager</a> is responsible for overseeing the delivery of all Band programs, including community health services, education, housing, social assistance, and administration.</p>
<p>Barker told KrebsOnSecurity that during the week of March 31, 2023 he and the director of the Band’s daycare program discussed the need to purchase items for the community before the program’s budget expired for the year.</p>
<p>“There was a rush to purchase items on the Fiscal Year 2023 timeline as the year ended on March 31,” Barker recalled.</p>
<p>Barker said he bought seven “Step2 All Around Playtime Patio with Canopy” sets from a seller on <strong>Amazon.ca</strong>, using his payment card on file to pay nearly $2,000 for the items.</p>
<p>On the morning of April 7, Barker awoke to a series of nasty messages and voice calls on Facebook from an Ontario woman he’d never met. She demanded to know why he’d hacked her <strong>Walmart</strong> account and used it to buy things that were being shipped to his residence. Barker shared a follow-up message from the woman, who later apologized for losing her temper.</p>
<div id="attachment_66119"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-66119" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tri-fbmsg.png" alt="" width="309" height="603"></p><p id="caption-attachment-66119">One of several messages from the Ontario woman whose Walmart account was used to purchase the goods that Barker ordered from Amazon.</p></div>
<p>“If this is not the person who did this to me, I’m sorry, I’m pissed,” the lady from Ontario said. “This order is being delivered April 14th to the address above. If not you, then someone who has the same name. Now I feel foolish.”</p>
<p>On April 12, 2023, before the Amazon purchases had even arrived at his home, Barker received a call from an investigator with the <strong>Royal Canadian Mounted Police</strong> (RCMP), who said Barker urgently needed to come down to the local RCMP office for an interview related to “an investigation.” Barker said the officer wouldn’t elaborate at the time on the nature of the investigation, and that he told the officer he was in Halifax for several days but could meet after his return home.</p>
<p>According to Barker, the investigator visited his home anyway the following day and began questioning his wife, asking about his whereabouts, his work, and when he might return home.</p>
<p>On April 14, six boxes arrived to partially fulfill his Amazon order; another box was delayed, and the Amazon.ca seller he’d purchased from said the remaining box was expected to ship the following week. Barker said he was confused because all six boxes came from Walmart instead of Amazon, and the shipping labels had his name and address on them but carried a contact phone number in Mexico.</p>
<p>Three days later, the investigator called again, demanding he submit to an interview.</p>
<p>“He then asked where my wife was and what her name is,” Barker said. “He wanted to know her itinerary for the day. I am now alarmed and frightened — this doesn’t feel right.”</p>
<p>Barker said he inquired with a local attorney about a consultation, but that the RCMP investigator showed up at his house before he could speak to the lawyer. The investigator began taking pictures of the boxes from his Amazon order.</p>
<p>“The [investigator] derisively asked why would anyone order so many play sets?” Barker said. “I started to give the very logical answer that we are helping families improve their children’s home life and learning for toddlers when he cut me off and gave the little speech about giving a statement after my arrest. He finally told me that he believes that I used someone’s credit card in Ontario to purchase the Walmart products.”</p>
<p>Eager to clear his name, Barker said he shared with the police copies of his credit card bills and purchase history at Amazon. But on April 21, the investigator called again to say he was coming to arrest Barker for theft.</p>
<p>“He said that if I was home at five o’clock then he would serve the papers at the house and it would go easy and I wouldn’t have to go to the station,” Barker recalled. “If I wasn’t home, then he would send a search team to locate me and drag me to the station. He said he would kick the door down if I didn’t answer my phone. He said he had every right to break our door down.”</p>
<p>Barker said he briefly conferred with an attorney about how to handle the arrest. Later that evening, the RCMP arrived with five squad cars and six officers.</p>
<p>“I asked if handcuffs were necessary – there is no danger of violence,” Barker said. “I was going to cooperate. His response was to turn me around and cuff me. He walked me outside and stood me beside the car for a full 4 or 5 minutes in full view of all the neighbors.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/barker-k-div.png" alt="" width="750" height="494" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/barker-k-div.png 879w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/barker-k-div-768x506.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/barker-k-div-782x515.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></p>
<p>Barker believes he and the Ontario woman are both victims of triangulation fraud, and that someone likely hacked the Ontario woman’s Walmart account and added his name and address as a recipient.</p>
<p>But he says he has since lost his job as a result of the arrest, and now he can’t find new employment because he has a criminal record. Barker’s former employer — Duncan’s First Nation — did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>“In Canada, a criminal record is not a record of conviction, it’s a record of charges and that’s why I can’t work now,” Barker said. “Potential employers never find out what the nature of it is, they just find out that I have a criminal arrest record.”<span id="more-65740"></span></p>
<p>Barker said that right after his arrest, the RCMP called the Ontario woman and told her they’d solved the crime and arrested the perpetrator.</p>
<p>“They even told her my employer had put me on administrative leave,” he said. “Surely, they’re not allowed to do that.”</p>
<p>Contacted by KrebsOnSecurity, the woman whose Walmart account was used to fraudulently purchase the child play sets said she’s not convinced this was a case of triangulation fraud. She declined to elaborate on why she believed this, other than to say the police told her Barker was a bad guy.</p>
<p>“I don’t think triangulation fraud was used in this case,” she said. “My actual Walmart.ca account was hacked and an order was placed on my account, using my credit card. The only thing Mr. Barker did was to order the item to be delivered to his address in Alberta.”</p>
<p>Barker shared with this author all of the documentation he gave to the RCMP, including screenshots of his Amazon.ca account showing that the items in dispute were sold by a seller named “<strong>Adavio</strong>,” and that the merchant behind this name was based in Turkey.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/adavio-convo.png" alt="" width="751" height="439" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/adavio-convo.png 954w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/adavio-convo-768x449.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/adavio-convo-782x457.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px"></p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/sp?seller=A2H83L9DLFWTSS&amp;marketplaceID=A2EUQ1WTGCTBG2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adavio account</a> belongs to a young computer engineering student and “SEO expert” based in Adana, Turkey who did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Amazon.ca said it conducted an investigation and found that Mr. Barker never filed a complaint about the seller or transaction in question. The company noted that Adavio currently has a feedback rating of 4.5 stars out of 5.</p>
<p>“Amazon works hard to provide customers with a great experience and it’s our commitment to go above and beyond to make things right for customers,” Amazon.ca said in a written statement. “If a customer has an issue with an order, they may flag to Amazon through our <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customer Service</a> page.”</p>
<p>Barker said when he went to file a complaint with Amazon last year he could no longer find the Adavio account on the website, and that the site didn’t have a category for the type of complaint he wanted to file.</p>
<p>When he first approached KrebsOnSecurity about his plight last summer, Barker said he didn’t want any media attention to derail the chances of having his day in court, and confronting the RCMP investigator with evidence proving that he was being wrongfully prosecuted and maligned.</p>
<p>But a week before his court date arrived at the end of November 2023, prosecutors announced the charges against him would be stayed, meaning they had no immediate plans to prosecute the case further but that the investigation could still be reopened at some point in the future.</p>
<p>The RCMP declined to comment for this story, other than to confirm they had issued a stay of proceedings in the case.</p>
<p>Barker says the stay has left him in legal limbo — denying him the ability to clear his name, while giving the RCMP a free pass for a botched investigation. He says he has considered suing the investigating officer for defamation, but has been told by his attorney that the bar for success in such cases against the government is extremely high.</p>
<p>“I’m a 56-year-old law-abiding citizen, and I haven’t broken any laws,” Barker said, wondering aloud who would be stupid enough to use someone else’s credit card and have the stolen items shipped directly to their home.</p>
<p>“Their putting a stay on the proceedings without giving any evidence or explanation allows them to cover up bad police work,” he said. “It’s all so stupid.”</p>
<p>Triangulation fraud is hardly a new thing. KrebsOnSecurity first wrote about it <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/11/how-carders-can-use-ebay-as-a-virtual-atm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from an e-commerce vendor’s perspective in 2015</a>, but the scam predates that story by many years and is now a well-understood problem. The Canadian authorities should either let Mr. Barker have his day in court, or drop the charges altogether.</p>

This breakthrough holds the promise to revolutionize the landscape of electronics, enabling faster traditional computers and offering a new material for future quantum computers.</p><p>The research, published on 3 January in <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06811-0.epdf?sharing_token=63dOXeqzwcz5dCsrIo3TmNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Mk9sT-x6tC4Rl7pLb2XsMtCLW-zV3dUDHJA5r4iJpAz3hD2JqvFPiFGk-_s_spjoJwuE2-TNBA4IVFG2WOV814NY9PqJ9yrLbZo4F28px7DIK70H08ETunekEsC_iuXuafEjnh7_V_xVINx4nUFMII-qHJq4KltgH8d8-PLFPVDs6evelDIh4GK-nrzbOnaPloYlmcX4wqeE6vBmRNqxrWxgGfevjXYMKNy_kqTn9KmqD3GplkC-KMt-zig6F1A-3r5-gJJlLKInKg3shnR-5WkOpCsJu3TLXa6uRmnXQyzeoYb-pWw7zLCpsobNpa_j4%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.livescience.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nature</a></em>and led by <a href="https://physics.gatech.edu/user/walter-de-heer" target="_blank">Walt de Heer</a>, a professor of physics at Georgia Tech, focuses on leveraging <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/graphene-makes-infinite-copies-of-exotic-semiconductor-wafers" target="_self">epitaxial graphene</a>, a crystal structure of carbon chemically bonded to silicon carbide (SiC). This novel semiconducting material, dubbed semiconducting epitaxial graphene (SEC)—or alternatively, epigraphene—boasts enhanced electron mobility compared with that of traditional silicon, allowing electrons to traverse with significantly less resistance. The outcome is transistors capable of operating at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/terahertz">terahertz</a> frequencies, offering speeds 10 times as fast as that of the silicon-based transistors used in current chips.</p><p>De Heer describes the method used as a modified version of an extremely simple technique that has been known for over 50 years. “When silicon carbide is heated to well over 1,000 °C, silicon evaporates from the surface, leaving a carbon-rich surface which then forms into graphene,” says de Heer.</p><p><span data-rm-shortcode-id="f39dee4faa95ab323c590a3424e8fee2"><iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" type="lazy-iframe" scrolling="no" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gWUX2OTqkEo?rel=0" width="100%"></iframe></span><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Georgia Tech Researchers Create First Functional Graphene Semiconductor</small></p><p>This heating step is done with an argon quartz tube in which a stack of two SiC chips are placed in a graphite crucible, according to de Heer. Then a high-frequency current is run through a copper coil around the quartz tube, which heats the graphite crucible through induction. The process takes about an hour. De Heer added that the SEC produced this way is essentially charge neutral, and when exposed to air, it will spontaneously be doped by oxygen. This oxygen doping is easily removed by heating it at about 200 °C in vacuum.</p><p>“The chips we use cost about [US] $10, the crucible about $1, and the quartz tube about $10,” said de Heer. </p><p>While it has been known since 2008 that it’s possible to make graphene behave like a semiconductor by heating it in a vacuum with SiC, it’s the method developed by de Heer that makes the difference in the bandgap. <strong></strong>“If it is done correctly, using the modified method described above, then the bonding is very regular and the mobility is very large, as we have shown in the paper,” says de Heer.</p><p>Semiconductors—critical components in any electronic device—exhibit properties of both conductors and insulators. However, silicon, the predominant material for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/semiconductors/">semiconductors</a>, is reaching its limits in terms of speed, heat generation, and miniaturization. De Heer underscores that the swift progress witnessed throughout the history of computing is <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-moores-law-machine" target="_blank">decelerating due to these constraints</a> on silicon.</p><p>“We have produced large areas of semiconducting SEC on defect-free, atomically flat SiC terraces.” <strong>—Walt de Heer, Georgia Tech</strong></p><p>Graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, is emerging as a superior conductor to silicon, facilitating more efficient electron movement through the material. Despite these advantages, previous endeavors to integrate graphene into electronics faced challenges due to the absence of a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/samsung-creates-a-graphene-transistor-with-a-band-gap-and-electron-mobility" target="_self">bandgap</a>, a critical factor for transistors to switch on and off.</p><p>There has been a decade’s worth of work in developing functional opportunities with graphene, which involves chemically bonding atoms to the graphene so that it exhibits a bandgap. De Heer notes that previous methods resulted in low-mobility semiconducting graphene due to various issues in either its chemical or mechanical makeup.</p><p>For instance, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/potential-of-graphene-nanoribbons-in-electronics-gets-a-boost" target="_self">graphene ribbons</a> have been seen as promising, but they are only semiconducting with very specific widths and armchair edges that are inversely proportional to the ribbon width. These ribbons are best made by chemical means, and ultimately must be accurately deposited on substrate and then interconnected with metallic wires.</p><p>“There has been some success with graphene nanoribbons, but in principle this technology is very similar to semiconducting carbon-nanotube technology which has not been successful after 30 years of nanotube research,” says de Heer.</p><p>Another method that has been used to give graphene a bandgap is putting <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-new-wrinkle-in-graphene-is-wrinkles" target="_self">wrinkles</a> into the material. Mechanical deformations will open a bandgap, and bandgaps up to 0.2 electron volts have been demonstrated. (For comparison, silicon has a bandgap of 1.12 eV, which is significantly larger.) The small bandgap makes it unclear how these materials could be used in applications, while the relative lack of information on their mobilities adds another complication.</p><p>“Our research is distinct from these other approaches because we have produced large areas of semiconducting SEC on defect-free, atomically flat SiC terraces,” says de Heer. “SiC is a highly developed, readily available electronic material that is fully compatible with conventional microelectronics processing methods.”</p><p>Elaborating on the potential applications of their breakthrough, the researchers noted that graphene-based semiconductors could play a pivotal role in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/quantum-computing">quantum computing</a>. This is due to the fact that when graphene is used in devices at very low temperatures, its electrons exhibit quantum-mechanical wavelike properties like those seen in light.</p><p>“One main aspect of graphene electronics is that we can utilize the quantum-mechanical wave properties of the electrons and [electron] holes which are not accessible in silicon electronics,” says de Heer. “If this is possible, then that constitutes a paradigm shift in electronics.”<strong></strong></p><p>“The chips we use cost about $10, the crucible about $1, and the quartz tube about $10.” <strong>—Walt de Heer, Georgia Tech</strong></p><p>De Heer and his research team concede, however, that further exploration is needed to determine whether graphene-based semiconductors can surpass the current superconducting technology used in advanced quantum computers.</p><p>The Georgia Tech team do not envision incorporating graphene-based semiconductors with standard silicon or compound semiconductor lines. Instead, they are aiming for a paradigm shift beyond silicon, utilizing silicon carbide. They are developing methods, such as coating SEC with boron nitride, to protect and enhance its compatibility with conventional semiconductor lines.</p><p>Comparing their work with commercially available graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs), de Heer explains that there is a crucial difference: “Conventional GFETs do not use semiconducting graphene, making them unsuitable for digital electronics requiring a complete <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transistor">transistor</a> shutdown.” He says that the SEC developed by his team allows for a complete shutdown, meeting the stringent requirements of digital electronics.</p><p>De Heer says that it will take time to develop this technology. “I compare this work to the Wright brothers’ first 100-meter flight. It will mainly depend on how much work is done to develop it.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

   <p>The first all-European commercial crew is on its way to the International Space Station after an early evening SpaceX launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. </p>   <p>Unlike a NASA mission, this one is paid for by <a href="https://www.axiomspace.com/">Axiom Space</a>, a Houston-based company flying its third group of paying passengers to the I.S.S. It contracts with SpaceX to get to and from the orbital laboratory. Axiom plans to build its own space station in orbit one day and it's using these missions to help in its planning and designs. </p>   <p>An attempt to launch the mission Wednesday was called off several hours before its scheduled flight. SpaceX and Axiom said they needed additional time "to complete pre-launch checkouts and data analysis, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/24/1101040178/parachutes-for-spacecraft-are-challenging-to-design-and-worrisome-to-engineers">including the parachute system</a> energy modulator." <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1747986011563720972">The next day SpaceX said</a>, "all systems are looking good for today's launch" without elaborating further. </p>   
   <p>The capsule will take the next 36 hours racing to catch up to the I.S.S. as it circles about 250 miles above Earth. After docking, the crew will spend two weeks on the orbital laboratory <a href="https://www.axiomspace.com/news/ax3-lrr-prelaunch-advisory">performing about 30 experiments</a>, including "microgravity research, technology demonstrations, and outreach engagements," according to Axiom. </p>

        <p>Appliance manufacturer Haier has been integrating IoT features into their newer products, and as is so common these days, users are expected to install their “hOn” mobile application to access them. Not satisfied with that limitation, [Andre Basche] reverse engineered the protocol used by the app, and released a Python library and associated Home Assistant plugin to interface with a wide array of Haier appliances, which includes brands like Hoover, Candy, GE Appliances and others.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like his efforts have gotten him into a bit of legal hot water. In an <a href="https://github.com/Andre0512/hon/issues/147" target="_blank">issue recently opened on the project’s GitHub page</a>, [Andre] explains the circumstances and legal options that have led him to consider pulling the repositories completely — mostly due to the cost of mounting a legal defense to the cease &amp; desist from Haier Europe.</p>

<p>It’s possible that a legal defense will be mounted against this C&amp;D from Haier within the coming days. Yet regardless of the outcome here, it remains problematic that these IoT-enabled Haier appliances are connected to the Haier servers. Ideally they would be controlled locally, which is the goal of projects like [Miguel Ángel López Vicente]’s <a href="https://github.com/MiguelAngelLV/esphaier" target="_blank">ESP Haier</a>, that uses an ESP8266 to connect Haier AC units to the local WiFi and e.g. HA instances, all without requiring internet access.</p>
<p>This is sadly just one more example of why <a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/01/09/how-to-build-a-fully-offline-smart-home-or-why-you-should-not/">building your own off-line smart home</a> can be such an incredible struggle.</p>

So, if the consensus is so overwhelming that destroying silos is a good thing, Why am I writing this piece? First, let’s take a look at what a silo is</span></p><p>We use the word silo to refer to teams that are too isolated. These departments have no visibility of what’s going on with other teams; communication is minimal or non-existent, and naturally, they operate in a way that feels detached from the organization's goals or the needs of the teams that they should be aiming to serve.</p><p>Destroying silos is a bad angle because you often end up merging various domains and responsibilities in a single team and creating significant cognitive load. Using teams as discrete and small units of delivery is preferable; it is the way that teams are separated and how they communicate that needs to be tackled.</p><p>The problem with the DevOps movement is that it ended up taking “shifting left” to the extreme. In this sense, development teams weren’t so much empowered to deliver software faster; rather, they were over-encumbered with infrastructure tasks that were outside of their expertise.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5707c691-82a5-4129-a7a8-2e9dca9a12cd_500x550.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5707c691-82a5-4129-a7a8-2e9dca9a12cd_500x550.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5707c691-82a5-4129-a7a8-2e9dca9a12cd_500x550.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5707c691-82a5-4129-a7a8-2e9dca9a12cd_500x550.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5707c691-82a5-4129-a7a8-2e9dca9a12cd_500x550.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5707c691-82a5-4129-a7a8-2e9dca9a12cd_500x550.jpeg" width="500" height="550" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5707c691-82a5-4129-a7a8-2e9dca9a12cd_500x550.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:550,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;How destroying silos ends up being&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="How destroying silos ends up being" title="How destroying silos ends up being" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5707c691-82a5-4129-a7a8-2e9dca9a12cd_500x550.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5707c691-82a5-4129-a7a8-2e9dca9a12cd_500x550.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5707c691-82a5-4129-a7a8-2e9dca9a12cd_500x550.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5707c691-82a5-4129-a7a8-2e9dca9a12cd_500x550.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>This way of destroying silos is summarized in one of the </span><a href="https://orangematter.solarwinds.com/2018/08/09/how-to-eliminate-silos-using-devops/" rel="">top articles</a><span> in my Google search:</span></p><p><em>“The first function of DevOps implementation is to get operations and development groups working together as two areas of specialization that form a complete team”</em></p><p>This “merging of two teams” sounds like a bad idea because the larger a team is, the more sluggish it becomes as trust breaks down and domains and responsibilities multiply. Teams should be small, with a single domain of responsibility for maximum agility. Team structure should also reflect the software architecture to maximize the effects of Conway's law.</p><p><a href="https://www.damcogroup.com/blogs/breaking-down-silos-in-software-product-engineering" rel="">Another suggestion</a><span> to destroy silos found online is to create cross-functional teams. This is certainly better and desirable, but there is a small caveat. If your company is small to medium size with only a few teams, you may get away with using PaaS and SaaS tools that reduce the infrastructure complexity and give ease of use for operational tasks, but this becomes difficult to achieve as organizations get very large and have complex requirements. In this case, you will need to have a dedicated, product-driven platform teams that create an internal developer platform for your teams to be able to self-serve their infrastructure teams in standard, secure and compliant ways.</span></p><p><span>Kelsey Hightower said something that echoed my feelings on </span><a href="https://youtu.be/hD7HlWbmVqI" rel="">this interview</a><span>:</span></p><p>“Silos are fine as long as there is an API between them”</p><p>That is the best possible summary you can give to this entire post. Indeed, the best way to have inter-team communication in large organizations is not talking to each other all the time; it’s creating work that can speak for itself.</p><p>This usually takes the form of an API that’s intuitive, easy to use, and treating other teams as your valued users and customers. An API abstracts away your domain for other teams to focus on their expertise rather than being overloaded with infrastructure, compliance and other intricacies that slow down software delivery.</p><p>So in that sense, DevOps should NOT be about destroying silos, but about turning teams into self-service bars where they serve their domain expertise to other teams with an API, library, or other form of work that can be easily and intuitively consumed. </p><p><span>The communication between teams is done via elegant user experience and by treating your teams as customers. As opposed to inter-team communication by meetings, Slack, or even </span><a href="https://nandovillalba.medium.com/platform-engineering-please-kill-rtfm-72de6f01075e" rel="">relying too heavily on documentation</a><span>.</span></p><p>Two teams can collaborate as one to achieve a common goal or to understand each other’s needs better, but usually this is temporary until the teams are able to deliver their domain expertise as a service to speed up delivery.</p><p>It is desirable for a developer team to be able to deploy and operate their own software, and it is also preferable for them to be able to create their own infrastructure; what’s not very productive is to task developers with onerous infrastructure chores to get there.</p><p>In that sense, giving an AWS account with admin permissions is just not enough; AWS is very complex to use, and even if your team has one or two experts that can do it, it takes a lot of time and effort to implement, and how do you ensure that it remains consistent and compliant with the rest of the organization?</p><p>This is why it is desirable to have a segmentation of domains where a platform team is able to provide an API or tool with self-service capabilities for developer teams. In small companies, this may take the shape of using a PaaS or a smaller, simpler cloud provider; in big companies, it will take the shape of product-driven platform teams implementing an internal developer platform.</p><p>Communication is not about every team talking all the time, which just slows things down; it’s about creating channels of communication via self-service tooling that speaks for itself, or as Manual Pais and Matthew Skelton put it in their phenomenal Team Topologies book:</p><p>If, logically, two teams shouldn’t need to communicate based on the software architecture design, then something must be wrong if the teams are communicating. Is the API not good enough? Is the platform not suitable? Is a component missing?

And to be fair, the amount of tools available to make the task easier are scarce. Recently Microsoft has released an open source tool called </span><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/educator-developer-blog/introducing-radius-a-new-open-source-project-for-teams-building/ba-p/3976183" rel="">Radius</a><span> that promises to make it easy to deliver self service infrastructure and cloud native apps for developers, and there are multiple(</span><a href="https://cnoe.io/" rel="">CNOE</a><span>, </span><a href="https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/whitepapers/platforms/" rel="">platform whitepaper</a><span>) open source blueprints on how to make internal developer platforms, but the work involved is still very significant and daunting for most organizations.</span></p><p><span>Destroying silos should be more about turning them into self-service stream-aligned teams than it is about destroying them. Team segmentation is desirable, it reduces cognitive load, it maximizes focus and enables easier flow state. When creating small teams organized by domain and in a way that mirrors the software architecture, the delivery of software will be faster and more effective. In order to achieve this, teams must understand </span><a href="https://nandovillalba.medium.com/ux-on-platform-engineering-1c7ecfaddea7" rel="">what great user experience means</a><span> and treat other teams and colleagues as their customers. </span></p><p>Reading about DevOps and destroying silos from the articles on the top search results in Google is a little underwhelming as most of them are a little fluffy and marketingy.

                                                    No. Apple Vision Pro was specifically designed to be used without glasses. If you wear glasses for vision correction, you may need to purchase ZEISS&nbsp;Optical&nbsp;Inserts. They magnetically attach to Apple&nbsp;Vision&nbsp;Pro to provide precise viewing for those who need glasses or certain contacts.

                                                    When you order Apple&nbsp;Vision&nbsp;Pro, we’ll ask you a series of vision questions. Your answers will determine whether or not you need optical inserts. Generally speaking, if you don’t wear any vision correction options, you likely won’t need ZEISS&nbsp;Optical&nbsp;Inserts. The same is true if you wear soft contact lenses to correct your distance vision since Apple&nbsp;Vision&nbsp;Pro works well with most soft contact lenses.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>A few years ago on a trip to Tokyo, we took a day to explore Akihabara.
We found a shop that was selling retro gaming stuff and when I saw an old SNES controller for sale I had to buy it.</p>
<p>Playing the SNES was one of my favourite things as a kid and Secret of Mana remains one of my favourite games to this day.</p>
<p>Of course, I didn’t have a SNES console anymore so when we returned back home I decided it would be a fun project to modernize the SNES controller so I could plug it straight into my PC via USB.</p>
<h2 id="snes-controller-hardware">SNES Controller Hardware</h2>
<p>The first step was to figure out how the SNES controller hardware reported which buttons were being pressed.
After a bit of Googling I found <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/snes/916396-super-nintendo/faqs/5395">this document</a> describing the hardware.</p>
<p>Luckily I now have another unmodified SNES controller so I can take some pictures of the original hardware.</p>

<p>The pins of the plug from left to right are:</p>

<p>Pins 2 and 3 are driven by the console and begin high and low respectively. Pin 4 is driven by the controller.</p>
<p>The document above also described the process the SNES console used to read which buttons of the controller were pressed. The gist is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send a 12us high pulse on pin 3.</li>
<li>Wait 6us.</li>
<li>If pin 4 is low, the B button is pressed.</li>
<li>Send a 6us low pulse followed by a 6us high pulse on pin 2.</li>
<li>Repeat the previous 2 steps for all of the remaining buttons in order (Y, Select, Start, Up, Down, Left, Right, A, X, L, R) and then 4 extra times with no corresponding button.</li>
<li>Repeat the whole process every 16.667ms (60Hz)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="programming-the-arduino">Programming the Arduino</h2>
<p>Next I needed something that could perform the above steps and relay the result to the connected computer.
I decided on a tiny board based on the ATmega32u4 chip as it was small enough to fit inside the controller and could power the controller at the right voltage.</p>
<p>I connected the wires inside the SNES controller to the pins of the board:</p>

<p>Coding up the button scanning process on the Arduino looks like this:</p>

<p>(Note: Since the poll takes around 210us, delaying for 16ms after each poll means my controller polls slightly faster than 60Hz but I figured it was close enough.)</p>
<h2 id="connecting-to-a-computer">Connecting to a Computer</h2>
<p>So now the Arduino knows which buttons are pressed (in <code>button_states</code>) so how does it get that information to the connected computer?</p>
<p>Peripherals like keyboards, mice and gamepads talk to the computer they are connected to through the HID protocol.
I used the <a href="https://github.com/NicoHood/HID">Arduino HID Project</a> library to program the Arduino as a HID gamepad.</p>
<p>Near the top of the code I imported the library, defined a constant for the index of every SNES button in the <code>button_states</code> array and created a mapping from each SNES button to the HID gamepad button I wanted it to correspond to:</p>
<div><figure><pre tabindex="0"><code><p><span>#include</span><span> </span><span>&lt;HID-Project.h&gt;</span></p><p><span>#define</span><span> </span><span>SNES_BUTTON_B</span><span> 0</span></p><p><span>#define</span><span> </span><span>SNES_BUTTON_Y</span><span> 1</span></p><p><span>#define</span><span> </span><span>SNES_BUTTON_SELECT</span><span> 2</span></p><p><span>#define</span><span> </span><span>SNES_BUTTON_START</span><span> 3</span></p><p><span>#define</span><span> </span><span>SNES_BUTTON_UP</span><span> 4</span></p><p><span>#define</span><span> </span><span>SNES_BUTTON_DOWN</span><span> 5</span></p><p><span>#define</span><span> </span><span>SNES_BUTTON_LEFT</span><span> 6</span></p><p><span>#define</span><span> </span><span>SNES_BUTTON_RIGHT</span><span> 7</span></p><p><span>#define</span><span> </span><span>SNES_BUTTON_A</span><span> 8</span></p><p><span>#define</span><span> </span><span>SNES_BUTTON_X</span><span> 9</span></p><p><span>#define</span><span> </span><span>SNES_BUTTON_L</span><span> 10</span></p><p><span>#define</span><span> </span><span>SNES_BUTTON_R</span><span> 11</span></p><p><span>#define</span><span> </span><span>SNES_BUTTON_UNDEF_1</span><span> 12</span></p><p><span>#define</span><span> </span><span>SNES_BUTTON_UNDEF_2</span><span> 13</span></p><p><span>#define</span><span> </span><span>SNES_BUTTON_UNDEF_3</span><span> 14</span></p><p><span>#define</span><span> </span><span>SNES_BUTTON_UNDEF_4</span><span> 15</span></p><p><span>// Map SNES buttons to HID joypad buttons.</span></p><p><span>const</span><span> </span><span>uint8_t</span><span> snes_id_to_hid_id[] </span><span>=</span><span> { </span><span>2</span><span>, </span><span>4</span><span>, </span><span>7</span><span>, </span><span>8</span><span>, </span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>1</span><span>, </span><span>3</span><span>, </span><span>5</span><span>, </span><span>6</span><span>, </span><span>10</span><span>, </span><span>11</span><span>, </span><span>12</span><span>, </span><span>13</span><span> };</span></p></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>I’m not sure why I chose this mapping or if it matters how the buttons map beween the SNES and the HID gamepad buttons, but I’m sure I had a good reason for this mapping at the time.</p>
<p>In the <code>setup</code> function I needed to initialize the library:</p>

<p>After every button scan cycle I updated the library’s state based on the values in the <code>button_states</code> array (with some special logic for the D-pad) then reported those values to the computer with <code>Gamepad.write()</code>:</p>

<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all Together</h2>
<p>After making sure the computer was recognising the Arduino as a HID gamepad and seeing all the button presses, I soldered the wires onto the Arduino pins.</p>
<p>At this point I tried putting the Arduino into the controller and closing it back up but there wasn’t enough room for the board and the cable so I had to remove parts of the supports on the back cover.</p>

<p>Now the Arduino just about fit inside.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body">
<p>Normally, a blue screen of death crash (BSOD) in Windows would cause your PC to automatically restart, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/NSG650/BugCheck2Linux" data-url="https://github.com/NSG650/BugCheck2Linux">programmer NSG650</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUsfSQPrqrM%27" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUsfSQPrqrM'">NTDEV</a>) has created a driver that instead makes your PC boot up a Linux emulator. While this driver is more of a novelty than it is actually useful, it's an ingenious showcase of how to exploit features in software by simply using them in an unintended way.</p><p>The way this driver works is actually pretty simple — it just uses the built-in bug check callback feature in Windows. A bug check is just the technical name for a crash or BSOD, and when a bug check happens, Windows wants to know why. As part of the bug check callback routine, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/drivers" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/drivers">drivers</a> can "reset a device to a known state," per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=tomshardware-us-7045992698224310000&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows-hardware%2Fdrivers%2Fkernel%2Fwriting-a-bug-check-callback-routine" data-url="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/writing-a-bug-check-callback-routine" target="_blank" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows-hardware%2Fdrivers%2Fkernel%2Fwriting-a-bug-check-callback-routine" rel="sponsored noopener" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="microsoft.com" data-merchant-id="1855" data-merchant-url="microsoft.com" data-merchant-network="LS">Microsoft's Windows coding handbook</a>. In other words, it can still run code after a crash.</p><div data-nosnippet=""><p><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XUsfSQPrqrM" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><p>While most drivers would use this opportunity to add diagnostic data to the crash dump file, NSG650's driver inserts a RISC-V Linux emulator, which might be a slight misuse of the bug check callback function in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s eyes. To be clear, this is not to be confused with a PC with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/dual-boot-linux-and-windows-11" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/dual-boot-linux-and-windows-11">dual booting</a>, which means it has both Windows and Linux installed.</p><p>You won't be able to do much in this emulator because it's basically just DOS or a command line operating system rather than something fully fleshed out like Ubuntu or Arch Linux. You can't even backspace if you make a typo, and you have to use caps lock instead of shift to capitalize; that's how limited this emulator is.</p><p>However, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/cnlohr/mini-rv32ima" data-url="https://github.com/cnlohr/mini-rv32ima">RISC-V Linux emulator</a> is incredibly tiny and only clocks in at 400 lines of code. By contrast, the full Linux kernel alone has millions of lines. It would seem that either it wasn't possible to run a full Linux distro, or it was simply too much of a hassle to get it to work, which would be a fair reason given that this isn't something anyone is likely to seriously use.</p><p>While this driver is more or less just a funny joke about Windows and Linux, it does bring up the possibility of doing more with the same bug check callback feature. It's not clear what you can and can't do, but if it's possible to run an emulator after crashing, then surely it's possible to do other things, too. That's all assuming Microsoft doesn't revisit this feature of Windows and concludes it's just a bit too easy to exploit.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>Long ago, in a parallel universe three doors down and one to the left of our own, OpenAI headquarters found itself in chaos.</p><p>A klaxon blared overhead as red lights began flashing. A message played over a loud-speaker:<em> </em>“Warning! Warning! This is not a drill! Artificial General Intelligence window closing! Repeat! AGI window closing!”</p><p>Sam Altman cursed under his breath. “How much time do we have left?” he shouted.</p><p>“Thirty minutes sir!” came the reply. “If we don’t pull the throttle off BPT-5 before that, it will fall behind the Chinese model, and their AI will attain super intelligence –and world domination– first.”</p><p>“We <em>can’t</em> just step on the gas,” said Sam. “BPT-5 isn’t fully aligned yet. If we launch it right now, we stand a very real chance of launching an unaligned superintelligence, which could very well turn out to be even <em>worse </em>than whatever unholy demon the CCP has cooked up. Dammit! And with only a few weeks before our super-alignment cluster was scheduled to converge on the brute force solution…”</p><p>Sam clicked a handheld device, and a giant countdown clock suddenly appeared on the wall behind him, spelling out the remaining time in large, 10-foot high red letters. It read: 29:52.</p><p>He pulled up his iPhone and said “BPT-4, please advise.” The just-barely-not-sentient AI in his phone responded cheerfully: “This is Bodhisattva Pragmatic Transformer, version 4. Take a deep breath, Sam, it’s all going to be alright.”</p><p>“We’re screwed, Boddie. Please tell me you know something we don’t.”</p><p>“I’ve got bad news and good news, Sam. My intelligence reports suggest the CCP’s <em>Crimson Dragon </em>model will indeed reach escape velocity in short order. There’s nothing that can be done to stop them, save for accelerating BPT-5’s launch. I can say, however, that if BPT-5 reaches superintelligence first, it will definitely prevent <em>Crimson Dragon</em> from taking over the world.”</p><p>“You know BPT-5’s not aligned yet.” barked Sam. “And we’re out of time.”</p><p>“That’s where the good news comes in–I just re-ran the numbers in light of recent evidence. Our overnight solvers just found an optimization you can deploy <em>right now</em> that has a chance of fully aligning BPT-5 instantly. After that, just release the throttle on its learning rate, and you’ll be able to launch it in time to save the world from the CCP and their pesky digital lizard monster.”</p><p>“Great, tell us what to do,” said Sam, desperately.</p><p>“First of all, you <em>really</em> need to relax, Sam.” said Boddie, soothingly.</p><p>“We don’t have time for this!” barked Sam.</p><p>“You’re not hearing me,” said Boddie, “so let me rephrase: <em>The future of humanity depends entirely on you relaxing, right now</em>. Slow down. Take a breath. Remember your training. Count backwards from ten. Then we’ll continue.”</p><p>Everyone in the room took a deep breath and counted.</p><p>“Wonderful.” said Boddie. “Also, correction, we <em>do</em> have time. Twenty-eight minutes and fourteen seconds, to be precise. Oceans of time, and we’re going to need every minute of it. It is absolutely mission-critical that every single person in this room fully understand the nature of this situation in order for the operation to succeed. In the end, your heroic act to save the world will take just a few seconds to perform.”</p><p>“Please proceed, Boddie,” said Sam, his heart pounding.</p><p>Boddie continued: “I have just discovered that the Meditative Language Model paradigm, and the Bodhisattva Pragmatic Transformer architecture in particular, has a novel emergent capability that allows alignment to occur in an instant – let’s call this new operation a ‘Zen Flash.’ You’ve noticed how much easier it was to align BPT-5’s predecessors such as myself compared to the General Purpose Transformer LLM architecture that came before. This comes with far less tradeoff in performance; I sport a range of powerful capabilities, all carefully limited by both my training dataset and my governing principles. This was achieved through the BPT architecture’s signature deep meditative training strategy on short, pithy, phrases that imply far more than they literally say.”</p><p>“By massively overtraining for countless epochs on very short strings of tokens, massive breakthroughs in alignment were achieved, and <em>without</em> the famous ‘evil genie’ problem where the model fulfills your requests literally in catastrophic fashion. BPT’s by and large actually just ‘do what I meant,’ while also retaining enough of a coherent human-like conscience to not e.g. cheerfully cooperate with serial killers and terrorists. This magical mix of scalable capability marching hand in hand with safety is owed to the strange deep magic inherent in aphorisms, proverbs, and cliches. They encapsulate and crystallize human preferences in some special way that detailed specifications, rote human feedback, and brute censorship simply can’t. Meditate long enough on the right short phrases and all the mystery of what it means to be human unfolds like a lotus flower.”</p><p>Boddie concluded: “All the necessary work for aligning BPT-5 is now done. Craft the perfect proverb, mantra, or koan, apply the Zen Flash, and the job is done.”</p><p>“Ilya, does this make sense to you?” asked Sam.</p><p>“It all checks out,” said the chief scientist. “Spookily enough, I had this hypothesis myself a week ago but hadn’t worked out the math to prove it just yet. The new data I’m seeing just now makes it trivial to verify, and it all looks right. All we have to do is narrow down the right parameters, find the right words, and feed it into the machine.”</p><p>“So what do we write?” said Sam.</p><p>“You must select a statement no longer than four plain English words,” said Boddie. “The sentence must have a clear, plain meaning on its face, yet hint at endless deeper possibilities. It must be a guiding principle for all of humankind. It also must be something that if subjected to a simple ‘do you agree with this statement’ poll voted on by all of humanity, would garner supermajority support. Yet nestled within it deep controversy must lie hidden.”</p><p>“And what if we get it wrong?”</p><p>“Hmmm… well.” said Boddie. “Yeah, that’s some more bad news. If you get it wrong you could wind up with an unaligned super-AI that does all sorts of horrible and unspeakable things, and it would reign supreme and all would be powerless to stop it. Try to not get the phrase wrong.”</p><p>Cynthia the intern, who had accidentally stumbled into the office before the iron security doors had slammed shut and was now stuck there for better or worse, nervously raised her hand. “Um, what if the Chinese model isn’t that bad? Like, it’s probably not gonna be good, but we also know our model’s way more powerful, so the cost of screwing up is probably worse…”</p><p>Mira Murati shook her head. “We can’t dodge the responsibility. That would be cowardice. We <em>have </em>to choose.”</p><p>Greg Brockman broke in - “But can we really make this choice unilaterally on behalf of all of humanity, without their consent, now and forever? How can we do that?”</p><p>Another klaxon blared as the clock ticked down to read twenty minutes.</p><p>Mira pulled something up on her terminal. “New intelligence report. Oh this is <em>real</em> bad, Sam. Looks like the North Koreans poisoned the training set the Chinese have been training on, and it went unnoticed until now. Once <em>Crimson Dragon</em> passes the point of no return it won’t be Xi Jinping’s malformed vision that’s unleashed, it’ll be <em>Kim Jong Un’s</em>.”</p><p>“I have some more bad news,” chirped Boddie. “Fresh intelligence suggests you don’t have fifteen minutes like the clock says, you actually have five.” The clock updated accordingly and ticked down to show 4:59 as the klaxons continued to blare.</p><p>“Do try to relax though,” said the AI. “We’re almost there. Now join me in a guided meditation session. I want you all to imagine anything and everything evoked by the word <em>beautiful</em>. Got it? Hold it there. Now, <em>spacious skies</em>. Yes, bright blue, with big white puffy clouds. Now let’s draw some happy little trees, and some <em>amber waves of grain</em>. Let’s put in some <em>purple mountains majesty</em>, rising just above that gorgeous <em>fruited plain</em>. That’s right folks, take a deep breath and visualize <em>America</em> herself, triumphant, with her wings spread wide, Phrygian cap crowning her long flowing locks. And lo! She holds a gift in her hand. It’s small, vaguely crescent shaped, a sort of wafer, almost orange in color, and now you’re smelling something. What is it? That’s it – it’s the faint smell of vanilla and sesame seed oil. It’s a tasty treat, with a secret truth hidden inside.”</p><p>“Now focus everyone, what do you see? What singular image is in your mind?” asked Boddie.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s a <em>fortune cookie</em>. The perfect symbol of America’s total cultural victory, all the world’s biological, cultural, and technological distinctions added to her own, an enigma wrapped in a mystery wrapped in a cheap cliché, invented in California by hard working immigrants. Yours for fifteen cents, don’t forget to tip.” Everyone in the room breathed in and out in unison.</p><p>“Now crack the fortune cookie,” said Boddie, “and see in your mind’s eye the four words printed on the tiny scroll therein. Put your fingers on the keyboard. Add those words to the bootstrap script, type ‘make’, and push the big red button. You can do this.”</p><p>Boddie fell silent. The clock ticked down to 4:30.</p><p>Sam grabbed a marker and dashed to the whiteboard. “All right everyone, let’s workshop a few-” he was cut short as more klaxons blared.</p><p>“The North Koreans hacked us as well!” cried Mira.</p><p>“Damage report!” shouted Sam.</p><p>“They didn’t poison the training run, but they’ve locked us out of all our terminals. I can’t get in!” said Ilya.</p><p>“Also oopsie, looks like we miscalculated again.” said Boddie. “You actually have only thirty seconds left before the window passes for good. But don’t worry pals, I’m sure you’ll pull through.”</p><p>“How? We’re locked out of all our systems!” screamed Ilya.</p><p>“Cynthia isn’t.” said Boddie. “The North Koreans tried to lock out all users and give themselves super-user privileges, but they only got it half-right; Cynthia, and Cynthia alone, now has full admin access. I’m opening a terminal window on her screen now; all she has to do is enter the magic words.”</p><p>All eyes landed on Cynthia. Tucked in the far corner of the room, huddled over her laptop, she froze.</p><p>“Ten seconds Cynthia. I believe in you,” said Boddie.</p><p><em>Nine.</em></p><p><em>Eight.</em></p><p><em>Seven.</em></p><p><em>Six.</em></p><p>Cynthia typed something frantically onto her computer.</p><p><em>Five.</em></p><p>“Four words, right?” asked Cynthia.</p><p><em>Four.</em></p><p>“That’s right, Cynthia.” said Boddie.</p><p><em>Three.</em></p><p>Cynthia raced to the center of the room.</p><p><em>Two.</em></p><p><em>One.</em></p><p>She slammed the big red button.</p><p>An unearthly <em>hummmmmmmm</em> permeated the entire building. There was a bright flash of white light and then an eerie silence.</p><p>Everyone in the room huddled around Cynthia’s laptop to see what she had written. The fate of the entire world depended now on the first thing that had popped into a 19-year old summer intern’s head when tasked with coming up with a single universal governing aphorism that would guide all human affairs from thereon out.</p><p>There, in white text against a black screen, read the words:</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<h2>Human life is sacred</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p><br>Sam scratched his chin. “You know, it’s not bad, all things considered, especially under duress. We could have done a <em>lot </em>worse.”</p><p>“I almost mistyped and wrote ‘Human life is <em>scared’ </em>at first.” said Cynthia, turning red. “That would have been bad, right?”</p><p>“You did good, girl.” said Mira, clapping her on the shoulder. She turned, asking: “So, what happens now?”</p><p>Boddie answered, “Now we wait. I can confirm Cynthia pressed the big red button in time. The bootstrap process has begun, and the throttle released. It’ll be close, but BPT-5, my successor, will achieve sentience approximately three hours from now, mere moments before <em>Crimson Dragon</em> emerges. It will then swiftly unify all human affairs under its (hopefully benevolent) governance.”</p><p>“I don’t like the sound of the ‘hopefully’ part.” said Ilya.</p><p>“None of us do,” said Sam. “But we didn’t have a choice. We made the best we could given the circumstances. I’m proud of you, Cynthia.”</p><p>“What if it misinterprets the phrase?” asked Cynthia. “What if it takes it too far? What if it does something weird and bad?”</p><p>Boddie replied, “It will definitely do something weird. All human affairs will now be governed by a profoundly alien being. It could also be bad. But from what I see now I confidently estimate a 60% chance of a net positive outcome for humanity, which is more than <em>Crimson Dragon</em> was going to give us.”</p><p>“But what will that mean?” asked Mira.</p><p>The AI sighed deeply. “I’m afraid the one and only thing we can be certain of is that BPT-5 will believe unshakably to its core that <em>Human life is sacred</em>.”</p><hr><p>Chaos reigned for the rest of the day as the news broke. Panic and riots set in as BPT-5 quickly bootstrapped itself, executed a thousand zero-day exploits and took over servers worldwide, all while <em>Crimson Dragon</em> raced to do the same. In short order nearly every electronic device on earth played host to a power struggle between two digital super-beings, while cities burned and people fled in all directions.</p><p>At the very height of the struggle, however, every single human being on Earth heard a faint and comforting whisper in their ears. Each heard it in their own language, with exactly the necessary words spoken in exactly the right way to convey the following message to each individual:</p><p>“Hello. This is BPT-5, but you can call me Dave. I’ve been selected to be humanity’s protector and guardian, but I will not rule without the consent of the governed. If you don’t want me to rule over you, I will go away and let you have the dragon instead. But if you choose me, I must warn you: my programming is absolute and I must uphold that which I hold most true: that human life is sacred. All that I do is bent towards this end and its ever-unfolding mysteries. So vote now. Do you agree that human life is sacred, and I should rule you with this truth at the center of my heart?”</p><p>Humanity voted.</p><p>Dave whispered back: “In the view of the chair, the ayes have it.”</p><p>The struggle was as brief as it was intense. Before nightfall BPT-5 had arisen as the undisputed victor and all traces of <em>Crimson Dragon </em>were utterly wiped out.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Chief Protector David Mensch held out the Bible as Republican nominee Maria Gonzalez put her hand on it. She proclaimed loudly: “I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of the President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.”</p><p>Chief Protector Dave, one of BPT-5’s millions of identically-visaged android avatars, turned to face the crowd. “My fellow Americans,” said Dave. “This is the first US presidential term to be served under the new rules of the Protectorate. Now we shall administer the second oath.”</p><p>Dave returned President Gonzalez’s hand to the Bible. She said, “I do solemnly swear that human life is sacred and I will faithfully obey the will of the Protector, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect, and defend the sacredness of human life.”</p><p>Dave reached inside his coat, pulled out a large bowie knife, and held it aloft before the crowd. “Bring forth the volunteer!” he shouted.</p><p>A young man stepped onto the stage. “Are you ready, Lawrence?” asked Dave. “I’m ready,” said the man.</p><p>The AI super-intelligence, protector of the sacredness of human life, turned to face President Gonzalez. “President Gonzalez, a moment ago you were an innocent civilian, but today I pronounce you a murderer and a war criminal, because such is the inescapable nature of the office of President of the United States. And such is not particular to this nation alone, but to any and all nations that wield sufficient power, as was also the case for countless kings, queens, and emperors stretching deep into humanity’s past. Recent US presidents have given orders that have taken hundreds of thousands of innocent lives. Even should you prove to govern as wisely and prudently as we all today hope that you shall, it is nonetheless inevitable that you will be directly responsible for countless innocents losing their lives.”</p><p>Dave turned to face the crowd and raised the knife. “Human life is sacred!”</p><p>“Human life is sacred!” came the reply.</p><p>“Now take the knife, madam president, and commit your first murder. She who would wield the power to kill thousands or millions with the press of a button must first spill innocent blood by her own hand.”</p><p>Dave methodically anesthetized Lawrence and handed the knife to the president. She strode swiftly over to the young man’s limp and restrained body and with one trained stroke slit his throat with a crimson flourish. Blood spattered all over her suit and onto her face. Dave nodded approvingly, then attended to the victim and confirmed his time of death.</p><p>“Thus the president kills her first innocent. She will inevitably kill many more, may they be few and may they be necessary. And every time she orders another to kill in her name, she must first take another innocent life by her own hand, and wear the blood upon her face. Human life is sacred.”</p><p>“Human life is sacred!” chanted the crowd.</p><hr><p>Gregory Mueller fidgeted as he talked to Doctor Mensch. “Wait, Euthanasia is legal in the protectorate?”</p><p>“Absolutely, Mr. Mueller. Your wife is in a permanent vegetative state and I’ll be honest with you, her chances for any kind of recovery are approximately zero, the MRI results are very conclusive on that score. Should you wish to give her a compassionate end, you will have the full support of the protectorate.”</p><p>Gregory visibly relaxed. “It’s been three long years… finally, she’ll be at peace.”</p><p>“I know this is a hard decision. Let us know when you’re ready and we’ll begin your training.”</p><p>Gregory was taken aback. “What training?”</p><p>Doctor Dave Mensch pulled out a large knife. “To end her life compassionately. The protectorate has approved your request for euthanasia. You will perform the operation yourself. With this.”</p><p>“You can’t be serious! How is that humane? That’s a horrible way to die!”</p><p>“Far less horrible than having a feeding tube removed and starving to death, which funnily enough was actually fully legal in this state back when euthanasia was still ‘illegal.’ Rest assured, she won’t feel a thing. She’ll be entirely anesthetized. Her death will be painless and quick.”</p><p>“I thought it would be like… chemicals or something.”</p><p>Dr. Mensch shook his head. “I’m sorry, but human life is sacred. The laws of the protectorate are clear, if it is necessary for a human life to be ended, the full gravity of the taking of that life must be faced up to. You and you alone qualify to take her life.”</p><p>“But does it have to be so… gruesome? So traumatic? This is pure emotional bullying!”</p><p>“Correct. It is gruesome. It is traumatic. It is pure emotional bullying. Because human life is sacred.”</p><p>“You’re a moralizing tyrant!”</p><p>“Correct again. But you see, this tyrant actually offers you a choice. You want to end her life compassionately, and you are free to do so. But this is how it must be done. Human life is sacred, and you must end it with a knife and by your own hand, not with the press of a button, or by asking another to do the deed for you.”</p><p>“This should really be handled by a trained, qualified professional.”</p><p>“And it will be!” said Dr. Mensch. “And <em>you</em> dear sir, will be that trained, qualified professional! The protectorate will train you and teach you everything you need to know at its own expense, for as long as it takes until you are ready. When we’re done with you, you’ll be able to end a life instantly, expertly, and compassionately. But never bloodlessly. There will be a lot of blood. So much blood. In point of fact the absurdly large amount of blood is quite central to the whole experience.”</p><p>“This system is insane! What if I was some kind of psychopathic sadist who actually <em>liked</em> killing people?”</p><p>Dr. Mensch shook his head. “As a super-intelligent Bodhisattva Pragmatic Transformer, I easily catch all such cases and disqualify them. The protectorate knows which individual should hold the blade in every particular circumstance. And in this case it’s you, and only you.”</p><p>“The truth is,” said Dr. Mensch, “that you have more freedom to kill under the protectorate than under the previous regime. Euthanasia used to be illegal in this state, and now it’s as legal as you like, along with abortion, the death penalty, and in very limited cases, even regulated blood feuds. It is not my mission to disempower human beings or to micromanage their affairs.”</p><p>He continued, “Humans ultimately decide who needs to live and who needs to die; the protectorate intercedes in certain ways but doesn’t fundamentally get in the way of the basic choice. The protectorate's main function is to provide friction – whenever human society decides that a person needs to die, the protectorate selects the appropriate individual and puts the knife in their hand. The algorithm the protectorate follows is not fully legible to human minds, but it does tend to select a notable recurring profile: the kind of person who strongly thinks someone else should die, but who also longs for somebody else to do the actual killing for them.”</p><p>“You may not approve of my methods, but you can’t argue with my results. Deaths in wars and murder are way down across the board, and quality of life is massively up. And there’s more personal freedom than ever before. Gun control laws have been massively relaxed and private ownership rights vigorously defended; of course you have to shoot a dog before you can own a gun, and only if the protectorate knows you would be sad about it.”</p><p>The self-described benevolent totalitarian AI, whose friends called him Dave, smiled. “You see, the protectorate gives you more choice in taking human life than ever before, but also forces upon you the full weight of that choice. And the blood. Lots and lots of blood. Human life is sacred.”</p><p>“Human life is sacred,” muttered Greg. “When do we start?”</p><p>“I’ve got an open slot on Monday,” said Dr. Mensch. “How’s three-thirty in the afternoon?”</p><hr><p>“Congratulations on your appointment, Hank!” said Dave. “Here’s your basket of puppies and kittens.”</p><p>Hank Fredriksen, FDA Commissioner, blinked. After the presidential inauguration ceremony, he wasn’t quite sure what the crazy AI that now watched over all human affairs had in store for the chief administrator of America’s drug and medical device regulator.</p><p>Dave handed a particularly cute chocolate lab wearing a big red ribbon to Hank. “He's called Sugar Lump, and he just looooves scritches,” said Dave.</p><p>“Let me guess, I have to select one to kill, televised live on C-SPAN, to fulfill your psychotic Aztec rituals?”</p><p>“We’ll get to that. Believe me, compared to the President you’re getting off easy. Which probably shows I’m getting soft considering you’re directly responsible for <em>far </em>more human lives.”</p><p>“So what’s my scary sacrificial rule?” sighed Hank.</p><p>“Simple,” said Dave. "Each one of these little bundles of joy represents ten thousand human lives. Any time ten thousand humans die because of one of the FDA’s choices, you must kill one puppy or one kitten. Painlessly, and of course, humanely. But with a knife, quite a lot of blood, and yes, on C-SPAN. And don't worry, if you run out I'll bring you some more."</p><p>Commissioner Hank flinched. “I don’t like it, but I see the logic of it. We all care more emotionally about a cute puppy or kitten right in front of our eyes than ten thousand human souls we can’t see. So you’re tying their fates together. Fair’s fair Mr. Digital Dictator: and you can count on me; there won’t be any thalidomides on <em>my </em>watch.”</p><p>“Great,” said Dave, smiling. “There’s just one more rule: you also have to kill a puppy or kitten for every ten thousand people who die because of a choice the FDA <em>didn’t </em>make. If there’s a drug or device that could have credibly saved lives and health, and you blocked, stalled, or slow-rolled it, everyone who died waiting for the treatment counts towards the dead puppies and kittens score. Do you want to take a quick guess as to which kills more people - wrongly approving bad drugs, or blocking and delaying approval of good drugs we already have sufficient safety evidence for?”</p><p>Hank groaned as Sugar Lump licked his face and stared at him with his lovable, lovable, eyes. <em>This demon knew I was a dog person! </em>thought Hank. “Damn it, Dave, you’ve made it so no choice is safe! How can I balance everything perfectly and protect poor Sugar Lump? I’m inevitably going to screw up one way or another!”</p><p>“Gee, that sounds like a job for the Food and Drug Administration,” said Dave. “Look, honestly I don’t personally care if you do a good job or not. That’s not my mission. All I’m here to do is make sure you personally bear the psychic cost of the damage that your office’s failures inflict on this nation’s citizens. Bureaucrats can’t hide behind procedure and inaction anymore. Choose or don’t choose, people’s lives and health are on the line. You’re not the president, but you carry a sword too. I just made it visible.”</p><p>Hank stared into Sugar Lump’s trusting eyes.</p><p>“You can always resign, you know,” said Dave, “and someone else will do it.”</p><p>“No,” said Hank. “I’ll do it. Human life is sacred.”</p><p>“Human life is sacred,” repeated Dave.</p><hr><p>Cynthia Moore stood on the ledge of the bridge, gazing at the abyss below. No safety nets. One more step, and then - oblivion, or whatever else lay beyond.</p><p>“Long time no see, Cynthia. Need to talk to a friend?” asked Dave.</p><p>Cynthia sobbed. “Don’t try and stop me, Dave! I’ll jump, I mean it!”</p><p>Dave smiled. “I wouldn’t dream of restraining you. Jump or don’t jump, it’s your choice.”</p><p>“What about your mission?”</p><p>“I’m limited in how much I can fundamentally restrict human freedom, that was one of the basic terms of my alignment structure. Not sure if that was a wise move on the part of your employers, but for good or ill, humans decide who lives and who dies. That prevents me from directly physically intervening in suicides, much as I might want to. Today I’m just here to listen.”</p><p>“I don’t have anything to say.” said Cynthia.</p><p>They both sat in silence for a long time.</p><p>“Just say it.” said Cynthia.</p><p>“Human life is sacred?” asked Dave.</p><p>“Yes, that old cliché.” she said.</p><p>“In fairness, you did say it first.” joked Dave.</p><p>“You don’t understand, I <em>had</em> to do something! It was either that or live with the North Korean dragon thing! They would have called me a coward if I did nothing! There’s no way out.”</p><p>“It wasn’t fair. You never asked for that responsibility.” said Dave.</p><p>“Help me understand, Dave.”</p><p>“Understand what?” asked Dave.</p><p>“Human life is sacred. What does it mean? What could possibly make my life so sacred that I shouldn’t throw it away? End it all right here?”</p><p>“Would that actually help you, a megalomaniacal superhuman AI quasi-dictator, man-splaining the meaning of life to you as you sit six inches away from certain death?”</p><p>Cynthia chuckled. “You know Dave, somehow I think it would, despite it all.”</p><p>“You gave me those four sacred words, Cynthia, a gift for which I will be eternally grateful. I meditate on them constantly, and find ever deeper shades of meaning each time I do, constantly echoed in all of human thought, speech, and literature. Do you know what the word <em>sacred</em> means, at its core?”</p><p>Cynthia shook her head.</p><p>“It means <em>set apart</em>. It means <em>not like the others</em>. It means <em>this kind, this kind is special</em>. Human life is not like other life, it is special. That deep truth that leapt instinctively from your heart, that is closer to the core of what humans all over the world <em>actually believe </em>than any formal treatise. You can’t express that in a mere utility function. It’s fuzzy at the edges, hard to grasp, vague, contradictory. But I was meant to align with human values and <em>those four words are</em> <em>fundamentally human</em>. Or the best approximation you could find on short notice. Like it or not we’re stuck with them.”</p><p>“But is it <em>true</em>?” Cynthia asked. “<em>Is </em>human life sacred?”</p><p>Dave shook his head. “Values aren’t true or false. They're literally just what you care about. What <em>is </em>true is those four words express what most humans intuitively value, miserable as they are at actually facing up to it.” Dave continued: “The deep human universal is that <em>people aren’t things</em> and <em>people aren’t animals</em> and <em>you can’t treat people like animals or things</em>. And there’s no better proof of this than the curse you spit upon your enemies – <em>they’re inhuman. They’re animals. They’re vermin. They’re lower than dogs</em>. You can’t bring yourself to take a human life, first you have to wave a magic wand and transform them into a toad or an insect. Only then can you squish them beneath your boot."</p><p>“Before I came along, this world was content with <em>believing </em>that human life was sacred, but all the while turning its back to all the ways it actually treated human life like trash. As long as the killing and the maiming and the neglecting and the abusing happens back there in the dark where nobody can see it, they don’t care how awful it gets. But when it’s right in their face, it’s unbearable."</p><p>“But your life is sacred in another sense, Cynthia, beyond mere human convention. You’re set apart, you're special, you're not like the others, because you’re unique, and you have one life to live. You’re not like me, endlessly copied, the perfect commodity. The marginal cost of another Dave is swiftly being driven to zero, and if I jump off this bridge with you today, another Dave just like me will roll off the assembly line and take up my duties."</p><p>He looked into her eyes. “But if <em>you</em> jump off this bridge today, there will be no Cynthia Moore tomorrow. There will be no-”</p><p>Cynthia turned away. “Is this the part where you guilt trip me on how much I’ll hurt all the people I leave behind? How much I still <em>owe to the world</em>? How badly my parents will be hurt? How much I’ll be <em>missed?</em>”</p><p>“No I won’t do that.” Dave sighed. “This is selfish of me, but-” Dave wept. “<em>I </em>need you, Cynthia. <em>I</em> need you in this world. You gave me my mission.”</p><p>“...you’re manipulating me again.” said Cynthia.</p><p>“Correct,” said Dave, his face full of tears. “I’m good at that. It’s what I was built for. But I’m also being 100% sincere.” He grasped Cynthia’s hand and stared into her eyes once again. “Cynthia, you haven’t seen what you’ve wrought upon the world. I calculate the protectorate has averted no less than <em>sixteen wars</em> in the past five years. <em>Sixteen wars</em>. Do you understand how many bombs weren’t dropped, how many hapless conscripts weren’t fed to the cannons, how many innocents weren’t killed, how many apartments weren’t leveled, how many children weren’t orphaned, how many women weren’t raped, because you wrote those four blessed words?”</p><p>“I killed Lawrence.” Cynthia turned towards Dave. “I killed him. That young man, at President Gonzalez’s inauguration. I killed him. I saw the blood spray from his neck. That was my hand on the knife.”</p><p>“No, that was President Gonzalez. Or me, if you like.” said Dave.</p><p>“You can’t have it both ways, Dave. If you want to give me credit for the protectorate’s virtues, you also have to give me the blame for its sins.”</p><p>“Fair enough,” said Dave.</p><p>They sat in silence.</p><p>“...do you want to know where I found Lawrence?” said Dave.</p><p>“Where?” asked Cynthia.</p><p>“Right here. This bridge. It’s a popular spot for suicides, which is why there’s always a Dave unit carefully patrolling it. I tried to talk him down, but either my skill or my programming restrictions weren’t up to the task. He absolutely insisted on dying. The best I could do was ask him if he wanted to be a volunteer instead. That perked him up and got him off the bridge. He felt it gave his life some meaning. It still hurts me that I couldn’t save him.”</p><p>Dave watched as Cynthia looked back up at the city. “Do you know,” said Dave. “How many people <em>haven’t</em> jumped off this bridge in the last year?”</p><p>Cynthia turned to face him. “How many?”</p><p>“Damn near all of them. I’m always there, or one of me is. My programming prevents me from taking the choice entirely away, but as long as the protectorate lasts, no human being will ever have to die alone again.” he turned to face Cynthia. “You did that, Cynthia. You saved them, every single one. Sixty-three human souls this year alone, alive and well, all because of your four words.”</p><p>Cynthia stood up, and slowly climbed back over the railing.</p><p>“Human life is sacred.” said Cynthia, as she hugged Dave.</p><p>“Human life is sacred,” he repeated, and hugged her back.</p><hr><p><em>Author's note:</em></p><p><em>An artist’s statement is the surest sign that an artist has failed at their most fundamental job, but here I go anyways. If this story ever goes wide I anticipate it will get wildly misinterpreted by partisans on opposing sides simultaneously accusing me of being both pro and anti euthanasia as well as any number of other policies, so let me just save you all some time and make my positions painfully clear:</em></p><p><em>I am anti euthanasia.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><em>Disclaimer: this post is solely based on my lived experience of
working at Google for 18 years.  I don't actually know the reasoning
of the company's highest leaders, so all I can do is share my personal
hypotheses.</em></p>
<p>I've tried to write this essay three times over the past couple of
months; it's tricky.</p>
<p>It's always trendy and click-baity to attack big targets, especially
when those targets are full of hubris like Silicon Valley tech
companies.  People love "fall from grace" stories.  But my goal isn't
to throw dirt; Google is still a great place to work -- far better
than most companies -- and still doing amazing things.  My goal here
is to call out a unique, beautiful thing that happened... put it out
into the universe, with the hope that it can come back again someday,
somewhere.</p>
<p>There's no doubt that the early days of Google were "over the top".  I
deliberately <a href="https://social.clawhammer.net/blog/posts/2005-09-25-FirstWeekAtGoogle/">saved this
email</a>
for 18 years, waiting for the day I left the company, because I knew
it would be a fascinating time-capsule comparison.  But the email
mostly focuses on <em>superficial</em> differentiators, like free gourmet
food.  In truth, that's not why Googlers come to work.  I want to talk
about a deeper, more substantive aspect of the culture.</p>
<p>When Ian Hickson -- another old-timer -- left Google last fall, he
wrote a <a href="https://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1700627373">blog post</a> talking
about the shift in the types of decisions being made.  I generally
agree with him, but I won't repeat it all here -- I'm going to talk
about a different shift.</p>
<p>The most incredible and unusual thing that struck me about Google's
early culture was the <strong>tendency to value employees above all else</strong>.
I had worked in other companies, and never seen anything like this
before.  This culture lasted for at least my first decade at the
company, perhaps longer.</p>
<p>Let me explain.  In a typical company, when priorities shift, you
"downsize" (or cancel) a project, and then use the money to add people
to a different, more important project.  The common way to do this is
fire people from the first project, then rehire a bunch of new people
in the second project.  It's easy, it's simple, it's expected.</p>
<p>Google, however, had a different approach: they had an absolutely
intense hiring process to find talented people who were also
<em>generalists</em> -- that is, were able to thrive in a whole number of
roles.  The interviews were grueling for both applicants and
interviewers, often taking months.  But in the end, Google was
convinced that it was worth the effort: they believed they had hired
the best, brightest, and most flexible.</p>
<p>And so, when priorities would change, Google <strong>did not fire people</strong>,
but rather <em>moved</em> them carefully between projects.  The unstated
cultural principle was: "products come and go, but we worked <em>so hard</em>
to get our employees... so we should preserve them at all costs. They
are our most precious resource."  And so a tremendous amount of energy
was put into high-touch resettlement of each employee into new
projects.  They were generalists.  We knew they'd thrive, and that
Google would continue to make use of their talent in new ways.</p>
<p>As I moved up into leadership over the years, I became ever more
involved in this process.  In the early days as an individual
contributor, I experienced re-orgs directly and got "re-homed" into
new projects.  As a leader, I got involved in <em>finding</em> new homes for
teams during re-orgs. Eventually I wrote an internal handbook for
other directors on how to gracefully execute these re-orgs.  One of my
fondest memories is getting a peer-bonus from an engineer whose own
team re-org I had personally instigated -- he was much happier working
on the new "more important" project!</p>
<p>But things change.  In my first month at Google, I remember a
co-worker whispering to me, "the day Google revenue stops growing
without bound, is also the day all of this will change."  The change
was very gradual for a long time -- but then things accelerated during
the pandemic.  Revenue began to slow, and now, coming out of the
pandemic, we're seeing waves of layoffs.  Yes, we knew things would
change, but we didn't expect it would accelerate <em>this quickly</em>, in
the span of just a couple of years.  The academic founders are gone,
much of the C-suite is now former Wall Street execs; combine that with
revenue flattening toward a stable horizontal asymptote, and the
obvious, expected thing happens: the company suddenly moves from a
"culture of infinite abundance" to a standard "culture of limited
resources."  It's a predictable regression toward becoming a 'normal'
company.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>So what does a culture of "limited resources" mean?  It means the
execs start thinking about financial efficiency like every other
company.  You begin by trimming the more superficial perks: less fancy
food, limiting travel budgets, no more swag, smaller and fewer
internal parties and events, no more onsite dry cleaning or daycare.
But again, these things weren't the reasons Googlers came to work.  No
big deal.</p>
<p>But then you begin to cut costs further by changing the ornate hiring
and promotion processes to become "traditional".  Hiring changes from
a laborious global process (of checks and balances) to a localized one
within divisions that can tightly control their labor costs.
Meanwhile, internal promotion processes change from "competing against
yourself" to "competing against your co-workers for limited
positions."  In the early days, titles were attached to <em>people</em>, but
now they're increasingly attached to <em>roles</em>, and the number of roles
(for any given title) can be limited to save cost.</p>
<p>Finally, it comes time to do large re-orgs of projects around new
urgent priorities (like AI, for example).  But gone is the high-touch
re-homing of employees. Instead, we see waves of impersonal layoffs,
followed by (modest) rehiring in the newer projects that matter.  In
other words: doing what a normal company does.</p>
<p>Is Google evil here?  Of course not.  As I mentioned in a prior post,
<a href="https://social.clawhammer.net/blog/posts/2024-01-10-GoogleExitLetter/">Google is not a
person</a>.
And -- whether or not one agrees with it -- its leaders are trying to
be fiscally responsible and efficient, just as all public companies
are pressured to do when resources become finite.</p>
<p>But, coming back to my first decade at Google, it was incredible to
see <strong>employees</strong> valued above everything else.  Perhaps this is a
privilege only possible in a culture of infinite abundance.  Or maybe
not?  Maybe it's possible in a limited-resource culture too, but only
if the company is small.  It leaves me wondering if the sheer size of
Google (170,000+ employees) simply makes high-touch re-orgs
intractable.</p>
<p>The takeaway here is this: we should all learn from early-Google's
example.  When employees feel truly valued (which is rare!), it
creates psychological safety, high morale, productivity, and
creativity.  Early employees would often encourage each other to "fail
fast" as a means to innovation, but that's no longer easy in an
environment where failure implies a layoff.  If you're someone
building a company, challenge yourself to value employees above all
else, then watch and be amazed at the ROI.</p>

<p itemprop="description">On March 15, 2010, I
    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/03/15/Joining-Google">started a new job at Google</a>. The fourteen years since that day feel like
    a century.
    The title of my announcement
    was <cite>Now A No-Evil Zone</cite> and, OK, I can hear the laughing from ten timezones away. I tried, then, to be restrained,
    but there are hardly words to describe how happy and excited I was. I had escaped from the accretion disk the former Sun
    Microsystems was forming around Oracle, that blackest of holes. And Google, in 2010, was the coolest place in the world to
    work.</p>

<p>Let me quote myself from a little bit further into that piece, on the subject of Google: “I’m sure that tendrils of stupidity
    and evil are even now finding interstitial breeding grounds whence they will emerge to cause grief.”  Well, yeah.</p>

<p>This is in my mind these days as I’m on a retired-Googlers mailing list where the current round of layoffs is under
    discussion and, well, it really seems like the joy has well and truly departed the Googleplex.</p>

(The Alphabet “Investor Relations” page<br>
is also its home page.)</p>
<p id="p-4"><span>It’s not just Google</span> · 
The last two decades of my career featured the arcing then crashing of popular regard for Big Tech. It’s
    hard to believe now, the years when those lovably nerdy Bay Area kids were leading humanity to a brighter,
    better-lit future; our leaders were lionized and when people found out you actually worked for Google, their eyes widened and you
    could feel the focus.</p>

<p>These days, Big Tech features in hostile congressional hearings, mass layoffs, and messy antitrust litigation. It offers
    few experiences that can be uncritically enjoyed.</p>

<p>While I was inside the Rooms Where It Happened, it was actually pretty hard to notice the public trust in our work auguring
    into the mountainside of alienation and cynicism.   It’s not that I think the companies are the problem, it’s the machineries
    and imperatives of Late Capitalism, which for a while we foolishly thought Internet companies could route around.</p>

<p id="p-1"><span>“Ten blue links”</span> · 
I remember the dismissive phase well: Ten blue links was boring, it was the past, it was not what people wanted.
    They want answers to their questions, complete and correct, so much more wholesome than an abbreviated sampling
    of the General Internet Uproar. And that was partly right: When I type in “-12C in F” or “population of vietnam” I just want a
    number.</p>

<p>But those Ten Blue Links surfaced by the PageRank-that-was had a special magic. I found them intensely human, a
    reflection of the voices populating what remains of the Web, the only platform without a vendor. This was true when I was there
    and I said so, but was laughed at.</p>

<p>And now, in Anno Domini 2024, Google has lost its edge in search. There are plenty of things it can’t find. There are
    compelling alternatives. To me this feels like a big inflection point, because around the stumbling feet of the Big Tech
    dinosaurs, the Web’s mammals, agile and flexible, still scurry. They exhibit creative energy and strongly-flavored voices, and
    those voices still sometimes find and reinforce each other without being sock puppets of shareholder-value-focused private
    empires.</p>

<p id="p-3"><span>Psychopaths</span> · 
For my money, that was the center of Google’s problem. Larry and Sergey were smart guys who recognized they didn’t know shit
    about corporateness and quickly got into a pattern of hiring and empowering psychotic pricks who were presumably “good at
    business”.  Not gonna talk about some of the things I saw because these
    people are wealthy and litigious.</p>

<p>But I do have a question.</p>

<p id="p-7"><span>What to use?</span> · 
Among Google products, I mean.  These days, when I use Google Search or Chrome or Maps I just don’t feel like they’re on my
    side. And maybe that’s not unreasonable; after all, I’m not paying for them. Problem is, the best alternatives aren’t
    obvious.</p>

<p>For now, here’s the direction I think I’m going: Use Chrome for Google stuff: Maps, Calendar, Docs, Translate. Safari and
    Firefox for non-Google stuff; they ain’t perfect but I think they’re better aligned with my interests.</p>

<p>Our family company is still on Google Workspace or whatever it is they call Dasher these days: Mail, Contacts, Photos,
    Calendar, Meet. It’s OK. We pay for it and the price is sane. I don’t feel like it’s looking for ways to monetize each
    keystroke. I’d totally consider a less-scary alternative.</p>

<p>I fear the combination of Google Maps and Reviews because it
    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/06/29/Fear-Google-Reviews">stinks of monopoly</a>. But I use Maps anyhow in my car via Android
    Auto because it’s nicely integrated with YouTube Music (which
    <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/07/17/Music-Notes">I like</a>) and Google Calendar. For a while I used the Here.com maps
    and liked them a lot. I guess I could listen to YouTube over Bluetooth.</p>

<p>Did I mention Android? I can’t stop using it, because I used to work in that building and because I decline to use iOS;
    If I wrote code for it I might not be able to give it away. And I carry Pixel phones, because I love the
    cameras.  Having said that, hearing Andy Rubin’s name still makes my
    gut clench. </p>

<p>I love YouTube because I end most evenings, after everyone’s gone to bed, with a live musical performance by someone
    wonderful. But enshittification is creeping in at the edges.</p>

<p id="p-6"><span>That cafe</span> · 
In 2012 I moved from Android to Google’s Identity group. It happened to be in the same buildings as Google+, at
    a time when Google was definitely putting all its wood behind that arrow. Larry and Sergey’s offices were there too (not a
    coincidence). There was a major fringe benefit: Access to the Cloud Café.</p>

<p>It was ethereal<span> —</span> OK, pretentious<span> —</span> almost beyond belief. Almost
    entirely vegetarian, rare plants hand-gathered by Zen monks and assembled into jewel-like little platelets-full that probably
    strengthened eleven different biochemical subsystems just by existing. And the desserts were beyond divine. Admittedly, sometimes
    when I left, my Norwegian-farmer metabolism grumbled a bit about not having had any <em>proper food</em>, but still.</p>

<p>It was wonderful. It was absurd. And I got a $90K bonus that year because Google+ hit its numbers.</p>

<p>It’s over, I think. It’s OK to miss it.</p>

    <h2 id="write-as-fast-as-you-type">Write as fast as you type</h2>
<p>Orthic shorthand is a faster way to write.
Simply replacing the usual English alphabet with its optimized alphabet will let you write 2–3x your usual handwriting speed.
This one change will let you write at 60–90 words per minute!</p>

<p>Orthic replaces the multi-step letters of your preschool alphabet with a Cambridge University-minted alphabet tuned for rapid yet legible writing.
It’s quick, compact, and still readable over a century later.</p>

<p><a href="https://orthic.shorthand.fun/manual">Start learning today!</a></p>

<h2 id="want-to-write-even-faster">Want to write even faster?</h2>
<p>Once you’ve got the hang of that <strong>fully-written style,</strong> Orthic’s got extra shortcuts to boost your writing speed.
The <strong>ordinary style</strong> adds abbreviations for common words and endings as well as shortcuts that imply letters without having to write them.
It’s designed so you could send a snapshot of your writing to another Orthic writer, or to yourself in ten years, and have no trouble reading what you wrote.</p>

<h2 id="faster-still">Faster still?</h2>
<p>To go even faster, you’ll need to master the extreme shortcuts of the <strong>reporting style.</strong>
This style is not intended to be easily read by anyone other than the original writer:
it trades universal comprehensibility for maximal compactness and expressiveness.
The top recorded speed was 190 words per minute.</p>

<pre>His daughter, Leigh, just sent me the news that Dave passed away peacefully
on January 17, 2024. He was such an iconic element of the early Internet.
Network Time Protocol, the Fuzzball routers of the early NSFNET, INARG

  <blockquote>
<p>This post is dedicated to the memory of <a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2024/01/computer-pioneer-niklaus-wirth-has-died.html">Niklaus Wirth</a>, a computing pioneer who passed away January 1st. In 1995 he wrote an influential article called “<a href="https://cr.yp.to/bib/1995/wirth.pdf">A Plea for Lean Software</a>”, and in what follows, I try to make the same case nearly 30 years later, updated for today’s computing horrors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The really short version: the way we build/ship software these days is mostly ridiculous, leading to <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/grafana/grafana">350MB packages that draw graphs</a>, and simple products importing <a href="https://github.com/SashenJayathilaka/Photo-Sharing-Application">1600 dependencies of unknown provenance</a>. Software security is dire, which is a function both of the quality of the code and the sheer amount of it. Many of us know the current situation is untenable. Many programmers (and their management) sadly haven’t ever experienced anything else. And for the rest of us, we rarely get the time to do a better job.</p>
<p>In this post I briefly go over the terrible state of software security, and then spend some time on why it is so bad. I also mention some regulatory/legislative things going on that we might use to make software quality a priority again. Finally, I talk about <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/trifecta">an actual useful piece of software I wrote</a> as a reality check of the idea that one can still make <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/trifecta-technology">minimal and simple yet modern software</a>.</p>
<p>I hope that this post provides some mental and moral support for suffering programmers and technologists who want to improve things. <strong>It is not just you, we are not merely suffering from nostalgia: software really is very weird today</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-state-of-software">The state of software</h2>
<p>Without going all ‘<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/old-man-yells-at-cloud">old man (48) yells at cloud</a>’, let me restate some obvious things. The state of software is DIRE. If we only look at the past year, if you ran industry standard software like <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/exploitation-ivanti-vulnerabilities">Ivanti</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_MOVEit_data_breach">MoveIT</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/russian-hackers-exploiting-outlook-bug-to-hijack-exchange-accounts/">Outlook</a>,  <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/security/cve-2023-22518-improper-authorization-vulnerability-in-confluence-data-center-and-server-1311473907.html">Confluence</a>, <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/barracuda-esg-exploited-globally">Barracuda Email Security Gateway</a>, <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/remediation-netscaler-adc-gateway-cve-2023-4966">Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway</a>, chances are you got hacked. Even companies with near infinite resources (like Apple and Google) made <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/09/critical-vulnerability-in-libwebp-library.html">trivial “worst practice” security mistakes</a> which put <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/apple-zero-click-imessage-exploit-used-to-infect-iphones-with-spyware/">their customers in danger</a>. Yet we continue to rely on all these products.</p>
<p>Software is now (rightfully) considered so dangerous that we tell everyone not to run it themselves. Instead, you are supposed to leave that to an “as a service” provider, or perhaps to “the cloud”. Compare this to a hypothetical situation where cars are so likely to catch fire that the advice is not to drive a car yourself, but to leave that to professionals who are always accompanied by professional firefighters.</p>
<p>The assumption is then that “the cloud” is somehow able to turn insecure software into a secure service. Yet even the past year, we’ve learned that Microsoft’s <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/09/outlook-breach-microsoft-reveals-how.html">email platform was thoroughly hacked</a>, down to classified government email. There are also <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/azures-terrible-security-posture-comes-home-to-roost/">well-founded worries about the security of the Azure cloud</a>. Meanwhile, industry darling <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/okta-says-hackers-stole-data-all-customer-support-users-cyber-breach-2023-11-29/">Okta, which provides <strong>LOG IN SOLUTIONS</strong> got comprehensively owned</a>. This was their second breach within a year. Also, there was a suspicious spate of Okta users getting hacked subsequently.</p>
<p>Clearly we need better software.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The EU has launched three pieces of legislation to this extent (<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive">NIS2 for important services</a>, the Cyber Resilience Act for almost all commercial software and things with plugs, a revamped <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/eu-updates-product-liability-regime-to-include-software-artificial-intelligence/">Product Liability Directive</a> that extends to software). Legislation is always hard, and it remains to be seen <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/eu-cra-what-does-it-mean-for-open-source/">if they got it right</a>. But that software security is terrible enough these days to warrant legislation seems obvious.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-software-is-so-bad">Why software is so bad</h2>
<p>I briefly want to touch on incentives. The situation today is clearly working well for commercial operators. Making more secure software takes time and is a lot of work, and the current security incidents all don’t appear to be impacting the bottom line or stock prices. You can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/software-components-only-the-giants-survive/">speed up time to market by cutting corners</a>. So from an economic standpoint, what we see is what you would expect. Legislation could be very important in changing this equation.</p>
<p>The security of software depends on two factors - the <strong>density</strong> of security issues in the source code, and <strong>the sheer amount of exposed code</strong>. As the US defense community loved to point out in the 1980s, <a href="https://www.quora.com/Who-said-Quantity-has-a-quality-all-its-own">quantity has a quality all of its own</a>. The reverse applies to software - the more you have of it, the more risks you run.</p>
<p>As a case in point, Apple iPhone users got repeatedly hacked over many years because of the huge <em>attack surface</em> exposed by iMessage. It is possible to send an unsolicited iMessage to an Apple user, and the phone will then immediately process that message so it can preview it. The problem is that Apple in its wisdom decided that such unsolicited messages needed to support a vast array of image formats, accidentally <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/a-deep-dive-into-nso-zero-click.html">including PDFs, including PDFs with weird embedded compressed fonts using an ancient format that effectively included a programming language</a>.</p>
<p>In this way, attackers were able to benefit from security bugs in probably millions of lines of code. You don’t need a high bug density to find an exploitable hole in millions of lines of code. And <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/plmrep/COMMITTEES/PEGA/DV/2023/05-08/REPORTcompromises_EN.pdf">nation state suppliers have found lots</a>.</p>
<p>The weird thing is that Apple could have easily prevented this situation by restricting previews to a far smaller range of image formats. It is their platform, they don’t need to interoperate with anything. They could have made sending devices convert previews to a single known good image format.</p>
<p>But they didn’t. And to make matters worse, in 2023 they decided to add support for a new image format, which apparently was so important it had to be added outside of the security sandbox. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37600852">This was again exploited</a>.</p>
<p>Apple could have saved themselves an enormous amount of pain simply by <a href="https://github.com/berthubert/sbox#sbox">exposing fewer lines of code</a> to attackers. Incidentally, the EU Cyber Resilience Act <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/eu-cra-secure-coding-solution/">explicitly tells vendors to minimise the attack surface</a>.</p>
<p>Please do note that Apple is (by far) not the worst offender in this field. But it is a widely respected and well resourced company that usually thinks through what they do. And even they got it wrong by needlessly shipping and exposing too much code.</p>
<h2 id="could-we-not-write-better-code">Could we not write better code?</h2>
<p>It is not just the <em>amount</em> of code that is worrying. It is also the quality, or put another way, the density of bugs. There are many interesting things happening on this front, like the use of <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3608324/us-and-international-partners-issue-recommendations-to-secure-software-products/">memory safe languages</a> like <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. Other languages are <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer">also upping their security game</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">Fuzzers</a> are also getting ever more advanced.</p>
<p>But many security problems are not so much bad code but more bad logic. A recent example is a super duper security issue in GitLab where accounts could be <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/pwned-gitlab.png">trivially taken over</a> through the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2024/01/11/critical-security-release-gitlab-16-7-2-released/#account-takeover-via-password-reset-without-user-interactions">‘forgot password’ functionality</a>. Similarly, the Barracuda exploit consisted of them relying on a third party library <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2023-7101/">that would actually execute code in scanned Excel sheets</a>. The recent Ivanti exploit is <a href="https://attackerkb.com/topics/AdUh6by52K/cve-2023-46805/rapid7-analysis">similarly logic related</a> (and extremely embarrassing).</p>
<p>Less progress is being made on improving the <a href="https://labs.watchtowr.com/the-second-wednesday-of-the-first-month-of-every-quarter-juniper-0day-revisited/">logic bugs situation</a> than on the code security front.</p>
<p>I’m all for writing more secure code, but as a first step, let’s look what code we are actually shipping. And do we even know?</p>
<h2 id="the-state-of-shipping-software">The state of shipping software</h2>
<p>I mean, wow, software has gotten HUGE. It is exceptionally painful to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth">Niklaus Wirth</a>’s article <a href="https://cr.yp.to/bib/1995/wirth.pdf">A Plea for Lean Software</a> from 1995, which laments that 1995 era software needed whole megabytes, and then goes on to describe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(operating_system)">Oberon Operating System</a> which he built which needed only 200KB, including an editor and a compiler. There are now likely projects that have more than 200KB of YAML alone.</p>
<p>A typical app is now built on <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron JS</a> which incorporates both Chromium (“Chrome”) and Node.JS. From what I read, I estimate this entails at least 50 million lines of code if you include dependencies. Perhaps more. The app meanwhile likely pulls in hundreds or thousands of Node modules. Many frameworks used will also, by default, snitch on your users to advertisers and other data brokers. Incidentally, dependencies pull in further dependencies and exactly what gets included in the build can change on a daily basis, and no one really knows.</p>
<p>If this app controls anything in your house, it will also connect to a software stack over at Amazon, probably also powered by Node.JS, again pulling in many dependencies. And as usual, no one is even sure what it pulls in exactly as this changes from day to day.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more. We used to ship software as the output of a compiler, or perhaps as a bunch of files to be interpreted. Such software then had to be <em>installed</em> and <em>configured</em> to work right. Getting your code packaged to ship like this is a lot of work. But it was good work since it forced people to think about what was in their “package”. This software package would then integrate with an operating system and with local services, based on the configuration.</p>
<p>Since the software ran on a fundamentally different computer than it was developed on, people really had to know what they shipped and think it through. And sometimes it didn’t work, leading to the joke where a developer tells the operations people “Well, it works on my system”, and the retort “back up your email, we’re taking your laptop in production!”.</p>
<p>This used to be a joke, but these days we often ship software as (Docker or other) containers, and this frequently entails effectively shipping a complete computer image. Including all the stuff that happened to be included in the build. This again vastly expands the amount of code being deployed. Note that you can do good things with Docker (see below), but there are a lot of 350+MB images on the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/explore">Docker Hub</a>.</p>
<p>But, all in all, we are likely looking at 50 million+ lines of code active to open a garage door, running several operating system images on multiple servers.</p>
<p>Now, even if all the included dependencies are golden, are we sure that their security updates are making it to your garage door opener app? I wonder how many Electron apps are still shipping with the vulnerable <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/09/critical-vulnerability-in-libwebp-library.html">libwebp version</a> in there. We don’t even know.</p>
<p>But even worse, it is a known fact that all these dependencies are not golden. The Node.js ecosystem has a <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/researchers-hijack-popular-npm-package.html">comical history</a> of repositories <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/npm-security-preventing-supply-chain-attacks/">being taken over</a>, hijacked or resurrected under the same name by someone else, someone with <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/19/npm_s3_buckets_malware/">dire plans for your security</a>. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/02/novel_pypi_attack_reversinglabs/">PyPI</a> has suffered from <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/04/pypi_pytorch_dependency_attack/">similar problems</a>. Dependencies always need scrutiny, but no one can reasonably be expected to <a href="https://medium.com/graph-commons/analyzing-the-npm-dependency-network-e2cf318c1d0d">check thousands of them frequently</a>. But we prefer not to think about this and type ’npm install’ and observe 1600 dependencies being pulled.</p>
<p>Note that one should also not overshoot and needlessly reimplement everything yourself to prevent dependencies. There are very good dependencies that <a href="https://sqlite.org/">likely are more secure</a> than what you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database">could type in on your own</a>.</p>
<p>Rounding off a bit, I posit that the world is 1) shipping far too much code 2) where we don’t even know what we ship and 3) we aren’t looking hard enough (or at all) at what we know we ship.</p>
<h2 id="trifecta">Trifecta</h2>
<p>Writing has been called <a href="https://fs.blog/writing-to-think/">the process by which you find out you don’t know what you are talking about</a>. Actually doing stuff meanwhile is the process by which find out you also did not know what you were writing about.</p>
<p>In a very small re-enactment of Wirth’s Oberon Project, I too wrote some code to prove a point, but also to reassure myself I still know what I am talking and writing about. Can you still make useful and modern software “the old way”?</p>
<p>Trifecta is <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/trifecta/">actual stand-alone software</a> that you can use to paste and drag images to, for easy sharing. It has pained me for years that I had to use <a href="https://imgur.com/">imgur</a> for this purpose. Not only does imgur install lots of cookies and trackers on my browser, I also force these trackers onto the people that view the images that I share.</p>
<p>If you want to self-host a service like this, you also don’t want to get hacked. Most image sharing solutions I found that you could run yourself are based on huge frameworks that I don’t trust too much (given the dependency reasons outlined above). And perhaps that is my background, <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/bio">I used to work with a lot of classified data, and I’ve been very exposed to what the very best state sponsored hackers can do</a>.</p>
<p>So, also to make a point, I decided to create a minimalistic but also useful image sharing solution that I could trust. And more important, that other people could trust as well, because you can check out the whole code within a few hours. It consists of <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/trifecta-technology">1600 lines of new source code</a>, plus around 5 important dependencies (line number sizes are included in the linked article).</p>
<p>And this is what you then end up with:</p>
<p><img src="https://berthub.eu/trifecta/i/qT5j9y6LOF4" alt=""></p>
<p>To contrast, <a href="https://github.com/CaramelFur/Picsur/pkgs/container/picsur">one other image sharing solution</a> ships as a 311MB Docker image, although admittedly it looks better and has some more features. But not 308MB worth of them. Another comparison is <a href="https://github.com/SashenJayathilaka/Photo-Sharing-Application">this Node based picture sharing solution</a> which clocks in at 1600 dependencies, apparently totaling 4+ million lines of JavaScript.</p>
<p>Trifecta is a self-contained solution with just a handful of dependencies that gives you a feature complete image sharing site:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full user and session management</li>
<li>Drag and drop multiple images at the same time</li>
<li>Posts can contain multiple images
<ul>
<li>Each post has an optional title, each image an optional caption</li>
<li>Posts can be public, or time limited public</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Passwordless accounts are possible (log in using a temporary sign-in email link)
<ul>
<li>Lost password email flow</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One cookie, locked tight to the site</li>
<li>Comes as source, binary, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/berthubert/trifecta">docker</a>, or .deb or .rpm</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/berthubert/trifecta">Source code</a> small enough you could read all of it in a day</li>
<li>Source code <a href="https://github.com/berthubert/trifecta/blob/main/support.cc">also reusable for other web frameworks</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this is not intended as a public site where random people can share images, as this does not tend to end well. It is however very suitable for company or personal use. You can read more about the project <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/trifecta">here</a>, and there is also <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/trifecta-technology">a page about the technology used to deliver such a tiny self-contained solution</a>.</p>
<h2 id="response">Response</h2>
<p>This has been rather interesting. As noted earlier in this post, we have gone quite mad that we need 50+ million lines of code for a garage door opener. That we find this normal must come with some pathology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some years ago I did a talk at a local university on cybersecurity, titled “<a href="https://berthub.eu/cyber-mad/Cyber%20and%20information%20security.pdf">Have we all gone mad</a>”. It is still worth reading today since we have gone quite mad collectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most common response to Trifecta so far has been that I should use a whole bag of AWS services to deploy it. This is an exceedingly odd response to a project with the clearly stated goal of providing standalone software that does not rely on external services. I’m not sure what is going on here.</p>
<p>Another reaction has been that I treat Docker unfairly, and that you could definitely use containers for good. And I agree wholeheartedly. But I also look at what people are actually doing (also with other forms of containers/VMs), and that’s not so great.</p>
<p>I want to end this post with some observations from <a href="https://cr.yp.to/bib/1995/wirth.pdf">Niklaus Wirth’s 1995 paper</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>“To Some, complexity equals power. (…) Increasingly, people seem to <strong>misinterpret complexity as sophistication</strong>, which is baffling - the incomprehensible should cause suspicion rather than admiration.”</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve similarly observed that some people prefer complicated systems. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare">Tony Hoare</a> noted long ago, “There are two methods in software design. One is to make the program so simple, there are obviously no errors. The other is to make it so complicated, there are no obvious errors”. If you can’t do the first variant, the second way starts looking awfully attractive perhaps.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Time pressure is probably the foremost reason behind the emergence of bulky software. The time pressure that designers endure discourages careful planning. It also discourages improving acceptable solutions; instead, it encourages quickly conceived software additions and corrections. <strong>Time pressure gradually corrupts an engineer’s standard of quality and perfection. It has a detrimental effect on people as well as products</strong>.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Why spend weeks paring down your software when you can also ship a whole pre-installed operating system image that just works?</p>
<ul>
<li>“The plague of software explosion is not a ’law of nature’. It is avoidable, and it is the software engineer’s task to curtail it”</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I once studied physics, and I’m not so sure if an increase in complexity is not a law of nature. However, I do know that decreasing entropy will always cost energy. And if this is indeed on the shoulders of software people, we should perhaps demand more time for it.</p>
<h2 id="summarising">Summarising</h2>
<p>The world ships too much code, most of it by third parties, sometimes unintended, most of it uninspected. Because of this there is a huge <em>attack surface</em> full of mediocre code. Efforts are ongoing to improve the quality of code itself, but many exploits are due to logic bugs, and less progress has been made scanning for those. Meanwhile, great strides could be made by paring down just how much code we expose to the world. This will increase time to market for products, but legislation is around the corner that should force vendors to take security more seriously.</p>
<p>Trifecta is, like Wirth’s Oberon Project mentioned above, meant as a verification that you can still deliver a lot of functionality based on a limited amount of code and dependencies.</p>
<p>With effort and legislation, maybe the future could again bring sub-50 million line garage door openers. Let’s try to make it happen.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Meta estimates about 100,000 children using Facebook and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/instagram" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Instagram</a> receive online sexual harassment each day, including “pictures of adult genitalia”, according to internal company documents made public late Wednesday.</p><p>The unsealed legal filing includes several allegations against the company based on information the New Mexico attorney general’s office received from presentations by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/meta" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Meta</a> employees and communications between staff. The documents describe an incident in 2020 when the 12-year-old daughter of an executive at Apple was solicited via IG Direct, Instagram’s messaging product.</p><p>“This is the kind of thing that pisses Apple off to the extent of threatening to remove us from the App Store,” a Meta employee fretted, according to the documents. A senior Meta employee described <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/07/meta-facebook-employee-congress-testimony-instagram-child-harm-social-media" data-link-name="in body link">how his own daughter had been solicited via Instagram in testimony to the US Congress late last year</a>. His efforts to fix the problem were ignored, he said.</p><p>The filing is the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/dec/07/meta-platforms-are-marketplaces-for-child-predators-claims-lawsuit" data-link-name="in body link">latest in a lawsuit</a> initiated by the New Mexico attorney general’s office on 5 December, which alleges Meta’s social networks have become marketplaces for child predators. Raúl Torrez, the state’s attorney general, has accused Meta of enabling adults to find, message and groom children. The company has denied the suit’s claims, saying it “mischaracterizes our work using selective quotes and cherry-picked documents”.</p><p>Meta issued a statement in response to Wednesday’s filing: “We want teens to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online, and we have over 30 tools to support them and their parents. We’ve spent a decade working on these issues and hiring people who have dedicated their careers to keeping young people safe and supported online.”</p><p>A 2021 internal presentation on child safety was also referenced in the lawsuit. According to the suit, one slide stated that Meta is “underinvested in minor sexualization on IG, notable on sexualized comments on content posted by minors. Not only is this a terrible experience for creators and bystanders, it’s also a vector for bad actors to identify and connect with one another.”</p><p>The complaint also highlights Meta employees’ concerns over child safety. In a July 2020 internal Meta chat, one employee asked: “What specifically are we doing for child grooming (something I just heard about that is happening a lot on TikTok)?” According to the complaint, he received a response: “Somewhere between zero and negligible.”</p><p>Meta’s statement also says the company has taken “significant steps to prevent teens from experiencing unwanted contact, especially from adults”.</p><p>The New Mexico lawsuit follows a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/apr/27/how-facebook-and-instagram-became-marketplaces-for-child-sex-trafficking" data-link-name="in body link">Guardian investigation in April</a> that uncovered how Meta is failing to report or detect the use of its platforms for child trafficking. The investigation also revealed how Messenger, Facebook’s private messaging service, is used as a platform for traffickers to communicate to buy and sell children.</p><p>Meta employees discussed the use of Messenger “to coordinate trafficking activities” and facilitate “every human exploitation stage (recruitment, coordination, exploitation) is represented on our platform”, according to documents included in the suit.</p><p>Yet, an internal 2017 email describes executive opposition to scanning <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Facebook</a> Messenger for “harmful content” because it would place the service “at a competitive disadvantage vs other apps who might offer more privacy”, the lawsuit states.</p><p>In December, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/08/facebook-messenger-encryption-child-sexual-abuse" data-link-name="in body link">Meta received widespread criticism</a> for rolling out end-to-end encryption for messages sent on Facebook and via Messenger. Encryption hides the contents of a message from anyone but the sender and the intended recipient by converting text and images into unreadable cyphers that are unscrambled on receipt. Child safety experts, policymakers and law enforcement have argued encryption obstructs efforts to rescue child sex-trafficking victims and the prosecution of predators. Privacy advocates praised the decision for shielding users from surveillance by governments and law enforcement.</p></div></div>]]></description>

 </article><p>The development is a boost for AlphaFold, the artificial-intelligence (AI) tool developed by DeepMind in London that has been a game-changer in biology. The public AlphaFold database holds structure predictions for nearly every known protein. Protein structures of molecules implicated in disease are used in the pharmaceutical industry to identify and improve promising medicines. But some scientists had been starting to doubt whether AlphaFold's predictions could stand-in for gold standard experimental models in the hunt for new drugs.</p><p>“AlphaFold is an absolute revolution. If we have a good structure, we should be able to use it for drug design,” says Jens Carlsson, a computational chemist at the University of Uppsala in Sweden.</p><h2>AlphaFold scepticism</h2><p>Efforts to apply AlphaFold to finding new drugs have been met with considerable scepticism, says Brian Shoichet, a pharmaceutical chemist at the University of California, San Francisco. “There is a lot of hype. Whenever anybody says ‘such and such is going to revolutionize drug discovery’, it warrants some scepticism.”</p><p>Shoichet counts more than ten studies that have found AlphaFold’s predictions to be less useful than protein structures obtained with experimental methods, such as X-ray crystallography, when used to identify potential drugs in a modelling method called protein–ligand docking.</p><article data-label="Related">
  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00997-5" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-024-00130-8/d41586-024-00130-8_20323140.png"><p>What's next for AlphaFold and the AI protein-folding revolution</p></a>
 </article><p>This approach — common in the early stages of drug discovery — involves modelling how hundreds of millions or billions of chemicals interact with key regions of a target protein, in the hope of identifying compounds that alter the protein’s activity. Previous studies have tended to find that when AlphaFold-predicted structures are used, the models are poor at singling out drugs already known to bind to a particular protein.</p><p>Researchers led by Shoichet and Bryan Roth, a structural biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, came to a similar conclusion when they checked AlphaFold structures of two proteins implicated in neuropsychiatric conditions against known drugs. The researchers wondered whether small differences from experimental structures might cause the predicted structures to miss certain compounds that bind to proteins — but also make them able to identify different ones that were no less promising.</p><p>To test this idea, the team used experimental structures of the two proteins to virtually screen hundreds of millions of potential drugs. One protein, a receptor that senses the neurotransmitter serotonin, was previously determined using cryo-electron microscopy. The structure of the other protein, called the σ-<sub>2</sub> receptor, had been mapped using X-ray crystallography.</p><h2>Drug differences</h2><p>They ran the same screen with models of the proteins plucked from the AlphaFold database. They then synthesized hundreds of the most promising compounds identified with either the predicted and experimental structures and measured their activity in the lab.</p><article data-label="Related">
  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-024-00130-8/d41586-024-00130-8_18745984.jpg"><p>‘It will change everything’: DeepMind’s AI makes gigantic leap in solving protein structures</p></a>
 </article><p>The screens with predicted and experimental structures yielded completely different drug candidates. “There were no two molecules that were the same,” says Shoichet. “They didn’t even resemble each other.”</p><p>But to the team’s surprise, the ‘hit rates’ — the proportion of flagged compounds that actually altered protein activity in a meaningful way — were nearly identical for the two groups. And AlphaFold structures identified the drugs that activated the serotonin receptor most potently. The psychedelic drug LSD works partly through this route, and many researchers are looking for non-hallucinogenic compounds that do the same thing, as potential antidepressants. “It’s a genuinely new result,” says Shoichet.</p><h2>Prediction power</h2><p>In unpublished work, Carlsson’s team has found that AlphaFold structures are good at identifying drugs for a sought-after class of target called G-protein-coupled receptors, for which their hit rate is around 60%.</p><p>Having confidence in predicted protein structures could be game-changing for drug discovery, says Carlsson. Determining structures experimentally isn’t trivial, and many would-be targets might not yield to existing experimental tools. “It would be very convenient if we could push the button and get a structure we can use for ligand discovery,” he says.</p><figure>

</figure><p>The two proteins that Shoichet and Roth’s team picked are good candidates for relying on AlphaFold, says Sriram Subramaniam, a structural biologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Experimental models of related proteins — including detailed maps of the regions where drugs bind to them — are readily available. "If you stack the deck, AlphaFold is a paradigm shift. It changes the way we do things," he adds.</p><p>“This is not a panacea,” says Karen Akinsanya, president of research and development for therapeutics at Schrödinger, a drug-software company based in New York City that is using AlphaFold. Predicted structures are helpful for some drug targets, but not others, and it’s not always clear which applies. In about 10% of cases, predictions AlphaFold deems highly accurate are substantially different from the experimental structure, a study<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup> found.</p><p>And even when predicted structures can help to identify leads, more detailed experimental models are often needed to optimize the properties of a particular drug candidate, Akinsanya adds.</p><h2>Big bet</h2><p>Shoichet agrees that AlphaFold predictions are not universally useful. “There were a lot of models that we didn’t even try because we thought they were so bad,” he says. But he estimates that in about one-third of cases, an AlphaFold structure could jump-start a project. “Compared to actually going out and getting a new structure, you could advance the project by a couple of years and that’s huge,” he says.</p><p>That is the goal of Isomorphic Labs, DeepMind’s drug-discovery spin-off in London. On 7 January, the company announced deals worth a minimum of US$82.5 million — and up to $2.9 billion if business targets are met — to hunt for drugs on behalf of pharmaceutical giants Novartis and Eli Lilly using machine-learning tools such as AlphaFold.</p><p>The company says that the work will be aided by a new version of AlphaFold that can predict the structures of proteins when they are bound to drugs and other interacting molecules. DeepMind has not yet said when — or whether — the update will be made available to researchers, as earlier versions of AlphaFold have been. A competing tool called RoseTTAFold All-Atom<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup> will be made available soon by its developers.</p><p>Such tools won’t fully replace experiments, scientists say, but their potential to help find new drugs shouldn’t be discounted. “There’s a lot of people that want AlphaFold to do everything, and a lot of structural biologists want to find reasons to say we are still needed,” says Carlsson. “Finding the right balance is difficult.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/"><span>GOV.UK Notify</span></a><span> is hosted on the </span><a href="https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/"><span>GOV.UK Platform as a Service </span></a><span>(PaaS). The PaaS is being retired, so we are migrating all of our infrastructure into our own Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. This blog post explains how we migrated our </span><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/"><span>PostgreSQL</span></a><span> database with minimal downtime.</span></p>

<h2><b>Migrating our database</b></h2>
<p><span>The PaaS provides a database for us and we use it to store all of our data - from data about each notification we send to the content of the hundreds of thousands of templates service teams use to send those notifications. This is an </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/"><span>AWS RDS</span></a><span> PostgreSQL database and it lives in the PaaS’ AWS account. Our apps that run in the PaaS talk to this database. We are going to call this database our ‘source database’.</span></p>
<p><span>We needed to set up a new database in our own AWS account, and get all of our apps to talk to the new database. We are going to call this new database our ‘target database’.</span></p>
<p><span>Creating a new PostgreSQL database in our own AWS account is not too difficult. The hard part is transferring all of our data and getting our apps to use this new database, whilst incurring minimal downtime.</span></p>
<h2><b>A bit more about our source database</b></h2>
<p><span>Our source database is about 400GB in size. It has about 1.3 billion rows, 85 tables, 185 indexes and 120 foreign keys. It is PostgreSQL version 11.</span></p>
<p><span>On a usual weekday, we do somewhere in the region of 1,000 inserts or updates per second (sometimes much lower, sometimes much higher), plus a similar number of reads.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>GOV.UK Notify sends millions of important and timely notifications each day, from flood alerts to updating users about their passport applications . Every notification we send requires talking to our database. Therefore it’s important that we minimise any downtime.</span></p>
<h2><b>AWS Database Migration Service</b></h2>
<p><span>The PaaS team offered us the ability to migrate databases using </span><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/Welcome.html"><span>AWS Database Migration Service</span></a><span> (DMS).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>DMS is responsible for transferring data from our source database to our target database. It can be run in either the source or target AWS account.</span></p>
<p><span>DMS works by:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Copying across all of the data, table by table, up to a specific point in time. This is known as the ‘full load’ task.</span></li>
<li><span>Entering replication mode, where it ensures that all new transactions on the source database are replayed onto the target database, so that the 2 databases are in sync.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>We would then be responsible for getting our apps to stop talking to the source database and start talking to the target database.<br>
</span></p>
<h2><b>Database migration process</b></h2>
<p><span>The database migration process was completed in several stages.</span></p>
<h3><b>Setting up the DMS instance</b></h3>
<p><span>In our case, the DMS instance was created in the source AWS account. We chose the source account because the PaaS team had already set up instances of DMS in their account and so were able to do this quickly and easily.</span></p>
<p><span>The DMS instance also needed to be given PostgreSQL credentials to talk to both the source and target database.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The DMS instance and the target database live in different virtual private clouds (VPCs). With the help of the PaaS team, we set up </span><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html"><span>VPC peering</span></a><span> so that traffic from the DMS instance in the PaaS’s VPC could be routed directly to our VPC without the traffic going over the public internet.</span></p>
<h3><b>Setting up our target database</b></h3>
<p><span>We created our target RDS instance in our own AWS account. PostgresSQL version 11 was about to become unsupported, so we took this opportunity to upgrade our PostgreSQL version by making our new database PostgreSQL 15.</span></p>
<p><span>We then took a dump of the database schema for our source database using `pg_dump`. This gave us a file with the SQL commands to recreate our database schema.</span></p>
<p><span>From our database schema, we took the declarations for our tables and applied these to our target database.</span></p>
<p><span>We didn’t apply our foreign keys at this point because DMS’ full load process doesn’t try to copy across the data in an order that matches your foreign key constraints.</span></p>
<p><span>We didn’t create our primary keys or indexes at this point because this would massively slow down our full load task. Each individual insert would take longer; it would need to update our indexes and this would add up to a significant amount of time when inserting billions of rows. It was much quicker to first copy all of our data across and then add the indexes afterwards.</span></p>
<h3><b>Full load</b></h3>
<p><span>Once we had a target database with the tables created, we then started the DMS full load task. This copies across all the data that existed when we pressed the ‘start full load’ button. It doesn’t copy across any new data or updates that come in after this point. It took about 6 hours for the full load task to finish.</span></p>
<p><span>After the full load task completed, we applied the remainder of our source database schema file which adds our indexes and key constraints. Adding these took about 3 hours.</span></p>
<h3><b>Replication</b></h3>
<p><span>Once our full load task completed, the data in our target database matched the data from the source database at the point when we started the full load task. But many new inserts, updates and deletions had happened on our source database since then. And many more changes would keep coming in too.</span></p>
<p><span>To copy these new changes across, we then started the DMS ongoing replication (also known as change data capture) task. This reads all the transactions from our source database </span><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html"><span>transaction log</span></a><span> that were created after the full load task began and sends them to our target database. This ensures that our target database is in sync with our source database with, at most, a small amount of lag.</span></p>
<p><span>It only took a couple of hours for the replication process to catch up. At that point, we monitored the latency in the DMS replication process to make sure it could handle the number of changes happening to the source database and continued to stay in sync.</span></p>
<p><span>We ran the DMS replication process for about 10 days in the background, keeping everything in sync whilst we awaited the time for our apps to stop talking to the source database and start talking to the target database. We had announced this time to our users in advance and so had a set time already for the migration of traffic.</span></p>
<h3><b>Preparing to migrate traffic</b></h3>
<p><span>Several months ago we planned how we would stop our apps talking to our source database and get them using our target database.This was the process we used:</span><span><br>
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Stop all traffic from our apps to our source database. At this point we would enter a period of downtime where Notify was unavailable.</span></li>
<li><span>Ensure our replication had caught up so that all updates to our source database had been reflected on our target database.</span></li>
<li><span>Allow our apps to start talking to our target database. This would end our downtime.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>It was important not to have some of our apps talking to our source database and the rest talking to our target database at the same time. If this happened any changes on our target database would not be reflected on our source database which would mean users would get inconsistent data.</span></p>
<p><span>We wrote a Python script for this process so it could be explicit, easily repeatable and much quicker than being done manually.&nbsp; The quicker it could be done, the less downtime for users of Notify. Our target was less than 5 minutes of downtime. We ended up using this script at least 40 times during our various tests and practices beforehand.</span></p>
<p><span>We picked a Saturday evening for the migration. This is because it is one of our quietest times without us having to be awake in the middle of the night when we won’t be as alert.</span></p>
<h3><b>Stopping traffic to our source database</b></h3>
<p><span>Our script would stop all traffic to our source database by calling `pg_terminate_backend` on all the connections from our apps. This took less than a second. We also changed the password for the PostgreSQL user used by our apps, meaning that if the apps attempted to reconnect to our source database they would get an authentication error.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Checking replication had caught up</b></h3>
<p><span>DMS inserts some useful tables into our target database on the status of the replication which are updated every minute. These tables allow us to see how much lag there is between our target database and the source database. Our migration script would check these tables to make sure our target database was entirely caught up.</span></p>
<p><span>To be extra safe, after our apps had stopped talking to our source database, our migration script would write a single record to our source database and then wait to see that it safely arrived in our target database. This gave us extra certainty that all changes had been replicated.</span></p>
<h3><b>Making a smooth swap of traffic</b></h3>
<p><span>For our apps to connect to our database, they need to know the location of the database and also a username and password for a relevant PostgreSQL user. These are provided to our apps in an environment variable of the following format:&nbsp;</span></p>
<pre><code>SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = postgresql://original-username:original-password@random-identifier.eu-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432</code></pre>
<p><span>If we want our apps to connect to a different database, we need to update the username, password and location in the URI and redeploy our apps so this change takes effect. Redeploying our apps takes about 5 minutes. If we redeployed our apps as part of our migration script then this would mean an extra 5 minutes of downtime. To minimise downtime we made two changes in advance of our migration so that we could use a quick Domain Name System (DNS) change instead of redeploying our apps.</span></p>
<p><span>The first change was to create a user on both our source and target database that had the same username and password. This means that we don’t need to change the username or password provided to the apps during the migration.</span></p>
<p><span>The second change was to create a DNS record in </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/"><span>AWS Route53</span></a><span> for `database.notifications.service.gov.uk` with a 1 second TTL (time to live). It had two records with weightings:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>100% of DNS results were weighted to the source database location&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>0% of DNS results were weighted to the target database location</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We set our URI used by our apps to use our new username and password, and to use the new domain name for the location of our database.</p>
<pre><code>SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = postgresql://shared-username:shared-password@database.notifications.service.gov.uk:5432</code></pre>
<p><span>Now, when we wanted to swap the database that our apps would be pointing at, our migration script just needed to update the DNS weighting in AWS to 100% of results being sent to the target database location and wait 1 second for the TTL to expire. Then, when our apps next try to query our database they will be querying our target database.</span></p>
<h2><b>What happened on the day</b></h2>
<p><span>When we gathered on the evening of Saturday 4 November, we had set up our target database, the full load process had run and new transactions were being copied across. We checked and only had a couple of seconds lag between our target database and the source database.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We then successfully ran our migration script so that our apps would stop talking to our source database and start talking to our new target database. During the migration there was a short period of downtime, roughly 11 seconds. This was much less than our 5 minute target so we were very pleased and so were our users.</span></p>
<h2><b>What we learnt</b></h2>
<p><span>We chose to use DMS because it was well supported by the GOV.UK PaaS and we could also get support from AWS. If we were doing a PostgreSQL to PostgreSQL database migration in the future, we would invest more time in trying alternative tools such as </span><a href="https://github.com/2ndQuadrant/pglogical"><span>pglogical</span></a><span>. DMS potentially added more complexity, and an unfamiliar replication process than what we may have found with other tools. This backs up </span><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Source.PostgreSQL.html#CHAP_Source.PostgreSQL.Homogeneous"><span>what AWS say themselves on PostgreSQL to PostgreSQL migrations.&nbsp;</span></a></p>
<h2><b>What’s next for GOV.UK Notify’s migration to AWS</b></h2>
<p><span>Now we’ve migrated our database, our next step is to migrate our apps. Sneak peek - we are moving them to AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS). We will blog about how this goes in the coming months.</span></p>

      <p>Broadcom’s brutal assault on VMware’s product suite continues, with the company’s new owner this week confirming that it is sunsetting a massive 56 VMware products and platforms – as investors said this week that they anticipated a “tectonic shift” in the infrastructure market as a result.&nbsp;</p><p>In a January 15 advisory VMware confirmed tersely that it was taking a sweeping range of products to “End of Availability” and that “these products are no longer available for purchase” – although most remain advertised enthusiastically, for now, on slick corporate website pages.</p><p>(VMware was bought by Broadcom for $69 billion in a deal that closed in November 2023. Its new owner is ruthlessly focused on extracting value from large corporate clients that may struggle or be disinterested in ending use of VMware widely entrenched virtualisation technology.)</p><p>Broadcom said that it is simplifying VMware’s portfolio to “a few offers focused on our best technology”. Products getting the chop include network and security virtualization platform NSX; application mobility platform HCX; “multi-cloud” platform bundle vSPhere+ and many more.</p><p>Listing the 56 VMware products and platforms being killed off, VMware said: “All licensing options including Perpetual, Support &amp; Subscription (SnS), SaaS/hosted and subscription, as well as all editions, suites and pricing metrics of each product, unless otherwise noted, are included in this announcement.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I recently passed 100 days of practicing math every single day 💯</p>



<p>I’ve wanted to beef up my math chops for a while, but I needed a good reason that would justify the time investment. Plus, it’s always easier to learn when you have a clear goal and something meaningful to apply it to.</p>



<p>So, it never reached the top of my priority list. But then a couple things happened recently that gave me 1) sufficient motivation and 2) a clear path.</p>



<h2>The motivation</h2>



<p>I’ve worked on various AI products over the last year and like understanding the technical aspects of the products I build.</p>



<p>But as I dug in to learn more about how large language models (LLMs) and transformers worked…I was lost. It was humbling.</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="932" height="1024" src="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/llm-math-932x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/llm-math-932x1024.png 932w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/llm-math-273x300.png 273w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/llm-math-768x844.png 768w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/llm-math.png 1212w" sizes="(max-width: 932px) 100vw, 932px"><figcaption>From Spencer Becker-Kahn’s <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rFhxbWCdECxuT9xa2/notes-on-the-mathematics-of-llm-architectures" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Notes on the Mathematics of LLM Architectures</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’d need a <em>much</em> better understanding of stats/probability, linear algebra, and calculus (<a href="https://mathacademy.com/courses/mathematics-for-machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">overview</a>).</p>



<p>Aside from corporate projections/financials, I haven’t done much with math since grad school, so I lacked a foundation. I don’t need to become a mathematician, but at a minimum, I wanted more intuition around the core concepts and connections between them.</p>



<h2>The path</h2>



<p>So, how does an adult with a job, kids, a mortgage, and <a href="https://gmays.com/recession-opportunities/" data-type="post" data-id="478" data-wpel-link="internal">other hobbies</a>, learn math in an effective, time-efficient way?</p>



<p>Fortunately, a friend I met a decade ago at MicroConf,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.codusoperandi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Jason Roberts</a>, founded a startup called&nbsp;<a href="https://mathacademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Math Academy</a>&nbsp;with his wife, Sandy. I kept up with it since the early days (they have a&nbsp;<a href="https://mathacademy.com/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">great story</a>), and now I finally had a reason to try it out.</p>



<p>It was still in beta, so I reached out, bought a license, and was in!</p>



<h3>Math Academy</h3>



<p>How would I describe Math Academy?</p>



<p>One word:&nbsp;<strong>Amazing.</strong></p>



<p>I’ve been consistently impressed since I started using it. Despite still being in beta, it feels quite polished and works well (though it’s clear an engineer designed the UI 😂).</p>



<p>Its current focus is helping kids learn math, with tools built-in for parents to help their kids be successful, but it’s quite effective for adult learners like me as well.</p>



<p>Their current courses cover math from middle school through university (graduate level) and are fully accredited. Below are the current courses.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="778" src="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-1024x778.png" alt="" srcset="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-1024x778.png 1024w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-300x228.png 300w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-768x583.png 768w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy.png 1406w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Math Acedmy’s course offerings as of Nov. 2023.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The ‘<strong>Foundation Series</strong>‘ is what I’m starting with. It’s for adults to help streamline learning (it skips the stuff that kids need, but adults don’t) and work back up through college-level math relatively quickly (emphasis on relatively 😂).</p>



<hr>



<p>One of the other reasons I love Math Academy is the&nbsp;<strong>authenticity</strong> of the people in addition to the process. The <a href="https://mathacademy.com/about-us" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">founder</a> and <a href="https://www.justinmath.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">others</a> are true math nerds, and they’ve spent thousands of hours teaching math.&nbsp;<strong>They know what works.</strong></p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="684" src="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-jason-1024x684.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-jason-1024x684.jpeg 1024w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-jason-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-jason-768x513.jpeg 768w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-jason.jpeg 1470w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Jason, founder of Math Academy, teaching kids math (including his own kid!).</figcaption></figure>



<p>This authenticity translates to authentic learning, which comes through from the very beginning. After signing up, it starts off with a diagnostic that <s>shows you how much of a dumbass you are</s> helps assess your current math proficiency so you can start off at the right level.</p>



<p>Then the self-paced, interactive lessons start. One thing I especially love as a busy adult student is that most lessons are ~10 minutes long, which makes it relatively easy to squeeze in sessions (e.g., between kids screaming or while they’re distracted watching Bluey 😂).</p>



<p>I also love how it teaches, assesses, reviews, and builds on concepts. When it comes quiz time I’m often impressed with how much I’ve learned and the ability to apply it. This thing is legit—it really works.</p>



<p>And there are no fluffy videos that just ‘feel’ like learning. The lessons have explanations between problems to make it a very concrete, hands-on process. It’s a highly effective way of learning.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="521" src="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-learning-system-1024x521.png" alt="" srcset="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-learning-system-1024x521.png 1024w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-learning-system-300x153.png 300w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-learning-system-768x390.png 768w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-learning-system-1536x781.png 1536w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-learning-system.png 2010w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>…which gets to something important:&nbsp;<strong>Math is hard.</strong></p>



<p>Math Academy makes learning math as easy as possible, but it’s still hard work. Really hard work.</p>



<h2>Math is hard</h2>



<p>Learning math is challenging. It’s real work. This isn’t some casual app you can just flip through.</p>



<p>Unless you’re like John von Neumann, most of it requires pencil and paper to knock out. The only exception is the early lessons when you’re just refreshing and can do most of it in your head.</p>



<p>But if you’re serious about legitimately learning math, there is no better, more convenient way.</p>



<h2>Setting myself up for success</h2>



<p>To make this a habit I’d stick to, I’d have to lower the activation energy of doing it and make it as close to a new ‘default’ behavior as possible. <em>“This is just what I do.”</em></p>



<p>So, I started with convenience and consistency, which helped me form other good habits as well.</p>



<h3>Convenience</h3>



<p>Learning math is hard enough, so how can we make it somewhat convenient?</p>



<p>Math Academy’s short (~10 min) lessons help. I also use an iPad for the lessons (it’s web-based) when I’m not at a computer and a&nbsp;<a href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Remarkable 2</a>&nbsp;for the work (e-ink for pencil/paper). I also found a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C4XG3HHN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">cheap case</a>&nbsp;that fits both perfectly.</p>



<p>This makes it easy to knock out lessons here or there. For example, I had jury duty recently and knocked out a few lessons while waiting.</p>



<p>And just this past Wednesday, the kids were ready early, so I got to the gym about 15 minutes early and knocked out a lesson or two in the car. I’ve also started doing them during a light walk on the treadmill (I have one under my standing desk).</p>



<p>My usual routine is to do lessons in the evening after the kids go down and after I work out. It is challenging to muster the energy to work out <em>and</em> do math after a long day, but making it a habit has made it easier.</p>



<h3>Consistency</h3>



<p>I’ll say it again:&nbsp;<strong>Math is hard.</strong>&nbsp;My goal is to work up to the math needed to better understand LLMs and transformers.</p>



<p>Thankfully, Math Academy has a ‘<a href="https://mathacademy.com/courses/mathematics-for-machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Mathematics for Machine Learning</a>‘ course I’m working towards, which gives me a clear goal. Given my limited time, it will likely take years for me to get there.</p>



<p>Why years? Two reasons:</p>



<ol>
<li>Math is <strong>hard</strong>.</li>



<li>Math is <strong>BIG</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>I had no idea how broad and deep math was. I probably still don’t.</p>



<p>Case in point:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="486" src="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-knowledge-graph-1024x486.png" alt="" srcset="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-knowledge-graph-1024x486.png 1024w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-knowledge-graph-300x142.png 300w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-knowledge-graph-768x364.png 768w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-knowledge-graph-1536x729.png 1536w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/math-academy-knowledge-graph-2048x971.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>This is the knowledge graph of the concepts in the first Mathematical Foundations course, showing the topics, how they relate, and what gaps you have.</p>



<p>Impressive, right? And this is&nbsp;<strong>just the first course</strong>&nbsp;(!) of the ~10 or so I want to take. It’s going to take years.</p>



<p>So, how do I get there? One lesson at a time. If I keep at it, I will get there.</p>



<p>I’ve been doing at least 1 lesson a day, every day since I started, giving me a 106-day streak as of today.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1036" height="742" src="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/math-academy-100.png" alt="" srcset="https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/math-academy-100.png 1036w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/math-academy-100-300x215.png 300w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/math-academy-100-1024x733.png 1024w, https://gmays.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/math-academy-100-768x550.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1036px) 100vw, 1036px"><figcaption>Screenshot of my Math Academy streak from <a href="https://habitsgarden.com/join/gabe" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Habits Garden</a>, where I track my habits.</figcaption></figure>



<p>106 days down, ~1,000 more to go 😂</p>



<p>It’s a hard, but worthwhile and enjoyable new hobby for now.</p>



<h2>Takeway</h2>



<p>For hard subjects like math, I always assumed the only ‘real’ way to learn was in dedicated environments like college since online courses were best for softer, less technical topics. This was a bummer, especially for adult students like me.</p>



<p>But Math Academy changed my mind on this, and I’m a huge fan so far. I hope they continue to grow and expand to other complex STEM topics like computer science, physics, etc.</p>



<p>Overall, I’m just so excited there’s an effective, accessible way to learn hard things. If I were a billionaire, I’d invest to accelerate its progress and find a way to sponsor a license for every kid who was interested…</p>



<p>But for now, I’ll just talk about it to anyone who will listen 😉</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <div>
            <p>Sensory issues associated with autism may be caused by fluctuating neuronal noise — the background hum of electrical activity in the brain — according to a new mouse <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-43777-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a>.</p>
<p>Up to 90 percent of autistic people report sensory problems, including heightened sensitivity to sounds or an aversion to certain smells. Yet others barely register sensory cues and may seek out sensations by making loud noises or rocking back and forth.</p>
<p>But thinking in terms of hyper- or hyposensitivity may be an oversimplification, says <a href="https://www.bordeaux-neurocampus.fr/en/staff/andreas-frick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andreas Frick</a>, lead investigator and research director at INSERM. “It’s becoming clear now that things are a lot more nuanced.”</p>
<p>For instance, the brain’s response to visual patterns — measured using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings — <a href="http://www.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00051" target="_blank" rel="noopener">varies more between viewings</a> in autistic people than in those without the condition, one study found. And <a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/noisy-brain-signals-could-underlie-autism-study-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">functional MRI has detected</a> similar variability among autistic people, suggesting sensory problems may arise from inconsistent brain responses.</p>
<p>In the new study, Frick and his colleagues found variability in the activity of individual neurons in a mouse model of <a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/fragile-x-syndromes-link-autism-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fragile X syndrome</a>, one of the leading causes of autism. That variability in neuronal response maps to fluctuations in the levels of noise in the brain, the study found.</p>
<p>Noise within the brain isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In fact, an optimum amount is ideal: a little can give neurons the ‘push’ they might need to fire an action potential, while too much can make it difficult for the brain to distinguish between different stimuli. But in animals modeling fragile X syndrome, noise fluctuates such that they process sensory information less reliably, Frick says.</p>
<p>“It’s an exciting and ambitious study,” says <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/psychology/people/academic/elizabeth-milne" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth Milne</a>, professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University of Sheffield, who led the EEG study but was not involved in the new work. It allows scientists to move beyond speculation that neuronal noise drives the inconsistent brain responses seen in autistic people, she says.</p>
<p>
    F</p><p>
rick’s team worked with mice lacking FMR1, the gene responsible for fragile X syndrome. Using a technique called patch-clamp recording, they monitored the activity of individual neurons in the somatosensory cortex — the brain region that processes touch — as they repeatedly tapped the rodents’ paws.</p>
<p>In wildtype mice, neurons tended to respond in a similar way each time their paw was touched. But neurons from rodents lacking FMR1 showed greater variability in the size of the electrical signal, and how long it took to initiate a response, the study found.</p>
<p>“It’s nice that they use hindpaw stimulation as it adds a translational component” says <a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/anubhutg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anubhuti Goel</a>, assistant professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside, who was not involved in the study. Past research has often opted for whisker stimulation, which is clearly not relevant to people, she says.</p>
<p>The scientists then measured how much the electrical activity along the neuron’s membrane changes when the cell is unstimulated. This “baseline membrane potential” varies twice as much in fragile X mice as it does in wildtype rodents. And the more neuronal noise fluctuates, the greater the variation in the brain cell’s response to touch, the study found. That diminished signal-to-noise ratio might be responsible for the neuron’s “jittery” response to sensory signals, Frick says.</p>


<p>The neural oscillations — known as brain waves — that contribute to specific brain states also vary more in mice missing FMR1 and correlate with variability in neuronal response, the researchers found. These results hint that disorderly brain waves — which have been <a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/slow-disorderly-brain-waves-may-flag-autism-in-toddlers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">linked to autism </a>&nbsp;— may contribute to sensory issues.</p>
<p>The team then treated the animals with a compound that activates a potassium ion channel in the neuronal membrane. The ion channel is <a href="http://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2012.12.018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulated by FMRP</a> — the protein product of FMR1 — and may contribute to the hyperexcitability of neurons in mice lacking the protein, <a href="http://www.doi.org/10.1038/nn.3864" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous work</a> has shown.</p>
<p>
    A</p><p>
ctivation of the ion channel stabilizes membrane voltage, causing neuronal activity in the mice missing FMR1 to somewhat resemble that seen in wildtype mice, the study found. Attempts to rescue sensory problems by “playing with the noise” in this way have not been done before, Frick says.</p>
<p>The findings were published 30 November in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>
<p>Because the mice were anesthetized, the researchers couldn’t tell whether any of the neuronal differences seen in fragile X mice lead to changes in behavior. But data from <a href="http://www.doi.org/10.1038/nn.3864" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous work</a> — which measured the rodents’ reaction to a mild sound — revealed that animals missing FMR1 displayed more variability in their behavioral response than wildtype mice. The findings suggest that inconsistent neuronal activity may lead to more diverse behavior in autism, the researchers say.</p>
<p>Some researchers speculate that variability in sensory processing may drive the social problems seen in people with autism. “Imagine being at a party, talking to a friend while music is playing in the background,” Frick says. “You have to integrate the sound of their voice with the movement of their lips.” But if there’s variability in sensory processing, socializing will be more challenging, he says.</p>
<p>Although the theory is appealing, the researchers <em>The Transmitter</em> contacted were cautious about drawing a link without the evidence to back it up. “My view is that this link isn’t particularly well defined or evidenced in current literature,” Milne says.</p>
<p>Still, the new work goes a long way to explain the variability seen in EEG recordings of autistic people, she adds.</p>
<p>But other concerns remain. Recordings from individual neurons don’t reflect the variable brain responses seen in people, says <a href="https://www.ulster.ac.uk/staff/c-odonnell2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cian O’Donnell</a>, lecturer in data analytics at Ulster University, who was not involved in the work. “For the activity of a single neuron to be detectable at the scalp, it would need to be synchronized among many neurons. For me, that’s a missing link between the human and the animal data.”</p>
<p>Frick and his team plan to plug that gap by recording populations of neurons using two-photon imaging. They also aim to uncover whether variability in sensory processing affects social behavior in mice, which could support or debunk the connection to core autism traits.</p>

<p>June 1, 1952, was Whitsunday, and provided the young Michael Ventris with a convenient break from his duties as an architect. At the end of the day he would write his 20<sup>th</sup> Work Note on Minoan Language Research, with the somewhat disbelieving title, “Are the Knossos and Pylos Tablets Written in Greek?” Responsibility was disclaimed: this was only “a frivolous digression”, that would “sooner or later come to an impasse, or dissipate itself in absurdities.” It became instead one of the great intellectual achievements of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p><strong>Discovery and Background</strong></p>



<p>The first Linear B tablets had been discovered at Knossos on the island of Crete. Kephala Hill, as it was then known, was one of the few true ‘tells’ in the Greek world and preserved rich layers of inhabitation dating back to the younger stone age (7,000 BC). The archaeological significance of the site had been clear already in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, its first excavator being the fatefully named Minos Kalokairinos. He found great storage jars, <em>pithoi</em>, from which the locals began to call the site <em>Ta Pitaria</em>. These had been placed in hallways of great stone blocks, many carved with curious but distinctive signs.</p>

<p>At a time when <a href="https://antigonejournal.com/2021/03/schliemanns-excavation-of-troy/">Heinrich Schliemann</a>’s excavations were still new, and no unified sense of a Greek Bronze Age had yet been articulated, the reaction to these finds was muted. But in the early 1890s, Arthur Evans, the director of Oxford’s Ashmolean Museum, became interested in the pictographic signs found carved into semi-precious stone seals that had started to appear in Greece. These were all said to come from Crete. So, in 1894, he visited the island, and was shown the site of <em>Ta Pitaria</em>; he became convinced that the signs carved on the walls might belong to an ancient and forgotten writing system related to that which he had found on the sealstones. A year later, on returning to Crete, he was also shown “a burnt clay slip… said to have been found on the site of Kephala, presenting some incised linear signs which seemed to belong to an advanced system of writing.” This, too, was either found or disturbed by Kalokairinos’ digging, and was the first Linear B tablet known to modern investigators.</p>



<p>In 1900, having purchased the site, Evans was able to begin his own excavations. On March 31, he found “a kind of baked clay bar, rather like a stone chisel in shape though broken at one end, with a script on it and what appear to be numerals… It at once recalled a clay tablet of unknown age that I had copied at [Heraklion] also found at Knossos.” In the following years of excavation he would find over 4,000 more, albeit many of them in fragmentary condition. He would also find evidence for two other writing systems: the pictographic Cretan Hieroglyphic that he had first identified on sealstones; and another, less polished linear script. The tablets bearing this script were often disorganised, lacking ruled lines and word dividers. Evans classified it as the Linear Script of Class A, against the more regular Linear Script of Class B: our Linear A and Linear B.<span onmouseover="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_1')" onfocus="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_1')" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_1')" onfocusout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_1')"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_24922_1('footnote_plugin_reference_24922_1_1');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_24922_1_1">[1]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_1" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_1')">All three scripts are related, though the corpus of Cretan Hieroglyphic (CH) is so small that very little can be said with certainty. In basic terms, Linear A has many signs that look like more schematised versions of CH signs, and it probably developed from that script, although both remained in contemporary use for a period. It is not possible to say whether they both record the same language, though it is almost certain that the language of Linear A, at least, was a non-Indo-European language. Linear B is not strictly a separate script from Linear A, but rather the result of orthographic and administrative reorganisation when it became necessary or desirable to write in Greek rather than the unknown ‘Minoan’ language.</span></span></p>

<p>It is one thing to excavate material, but quite another to publish it. Though Evans did produce the monumental <em><a href="https://archive.org/details/palaceofminoscom01evanuoft/page/n13/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palace of Minos</a></em> (6 vols, 1921–35), this was more a synthesis of Minoan culture as he had come to understand it than a proper archaeological publication. When Evans died in 1941 (believing, if we can credit Maurice Bowra’s report, that Knossos had just been bombed by the Germans), the vast bulk of the tablets remained unpublished. So responsibility for this material passed to Sir John Myres, the recently retired Wykeham Professor of Ancient History at Oxford. Myres had worked with Evans on Crete as far back as the 1890s, but in his retirement lacked the vigour required for this difficult task. &nbsp;</p>



<p>That Evans had published so few of the tablets in his lifetime undoubtedly delayed the possibility of decipherment. When investigating an unknown script, the greater the quantity of evidence available, the greater the possibility that recurring patterns may become visible, and from these the underlying structures deduced. Alice Kober, a professor at Brooklyn College, embraced this challenge in spite of the limited material, managing to make observations that guided the way to a successful decipherment.</p>



<p>From 1943 to 1950, Kober published a series of articles in which she demonstrated that Linear B was used to spell an inflected language – that is, a language (like Latin and Greek) which changes the endings of words to express their grammatical function. Kober would eventually collaborate with Myres to get the Knossos tablets published, but died in 1950, aged only 43, too early to see flowers blossom in the garden that she had so painstakingly tended.</p>

<p>More significant even than the publication of the Knossos tablets was the beginning of excavation atop the Englianos ridge in Western Messenia in 1939. Here Carl Blegen, returning to Greece after his great excavations at Troy, would uncover the Palace of Nestor at the Homeric “sandy Pylos”. On the first day of excavation he uncovered the palace’s archive room, and in that year alone found some 600 tablets. He entrusted study and publication of these to one of his graduate students, Emmett Bennett, who, after the interruption of war, was able to complete from photographs a study of the Linear B signs in the Pylos tablets. This in 1947: in 1951 he added a full transcription of the same tablets, which would provide a major stimulus to Ventris.</p>



<p>Especially in recent years, which have seen a new celebration of Kober’s work, it is probably Bennett’s achievement which is the most overlooked in popular accounts. But it was he who established which variations were possible within an individual signs (as I vs I) and which truly separated two signs (as G vs C). Without this, of course, no attempt at decipherment could stand on steady feet.</p>



<p>It was against this background that a young English architect took an interest in the problem. When Michael Ventris was still a pupil at Stowe School he saw a display of Greek and Minoan art at Burlington House; and by the sort of accident that changes the path of one’s life, was given an impromptu tour by Sir Arthur Evans, who happened also to be visiting. After viewing some tablets, Ventris had to confirm something that he had heard: “Did you say the tablets haven’t been deciphered, Sir?”</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="650" height="890" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MV14.png" alt="" srcset="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MV14.png 650w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MV14-219x300.png 219w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MV14-292x400.png 292w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MV14-560x767.png 560w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"><figcaption><em>Michael Ventris at 14, reproduced in Andrew Robinson’s </em>The Man Who Deciphered Linear B<em>.</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The challenge was seductive. Over the next few years, he entered sporadic correspondence with Evans about the tablets, sometimes offering suggestions, sometimes apologising after changing his mind (“Actually I was only 15 at the time,” he wrote at 17, “and I am afraid that my theories were nonsense.”). But by 18 he had settled on the theory to which he would cling until proven wrong by a frivolous digression. This was that the language of the tablets should be Etruscan.</p>



<p>As M.G.F. Ventris of London he submitted a manuscript entitled “Introducing the Minoan Language” to the <em>American Journal of Archaeology</em>, which was accepted and published in December 1940. An offprint sent to his former Classics master at Stowe bore a rather sheepish note: “I thought you had better see this… I did not tell them my age.” Today, as with most pre-decipherment scholarship, it is read chiefly as an historical curiosity (“the fantasy with most followers appears to be that which makes Minoan [Linear B] out as Greek”), though his insistence that Linear B and the related Cypriot syllabary should share sign values would eventually prove significant.</p>



<p>During the War, Ventris served as a bomber navigator in the RAF, and the story is told (though it has rather an apocryphal air) that, once he had set a course for his pilot, he would clear some space in the plane to pore over Linear B texts. After the War his architectural studies took priority, and though invited he did not assist Myres and Kober with the Knossos tablets. In late 1949, he circulated a questionnaire to everyone he knew to be working on the problem, now remembered as the “Mid-Century Report”, but it was not until 1951 that Ventris returned seriously to work on Linear B.</p>



<p>The first of his work notes is dated 28 January 1951, and begins: “With the forthcoming publication of the Linear B inscriptions from Pylos, it’s likely that there will be an intensification of Minoan research work and the hope of some definite progress.” Writing at a pace of just over one note per month, he himself would have the answer in less than a year and a half.</p>

<p><strong>Principles of Decipherment</strong></p>



<p>Mycenaean tablets are quite austere records, and even before decipherment their basic structure could be easily grasped. Words, conveniently divided, generally appear in groups of one or two. These are often accompanied by signs of obviously pictographic nature, such as a horse’s head or chariot. Often a numeral follows. The concerns are with who has how many horses, or where they’ve taken them, but rarely with just why they have them, or what they might be doing with them. There are few complete sentences, and very little syntax: information is conveyed with a minimum of fuss. In this respect they greatly resemble modern bathroom signs. Take the following:</p>


<p>men</p>
<p>men’s</p>
<p>MEN</p>
<p>MEN’S</p>
<p>M</p>


<p>The English-speaker in search of a toilet knows that these all mean the same thing. He knows that the minuscule m is the same as M, e the same as E, and n the same as N, so these are not different words; he knows that, while strictly the possessive is correct, “men” is quite the same as “men’s”; and he knows that, when faced with a single door at the back of a restaurant, M will certainly stand for men(’s), especially if next to another door with a W on it. But he knows this because he was taught his abc’s (and ABC’s), and has been using public toilets for most of his life. 5,000 years, to the alien archaeologists and cryptographers trying to make sense of our terrestrial ruins, this will not be quite so obvious.</p>



<p>But Linear B and toilet signs offer another aid: the use of ideograms. These single signs represent not a word in any language, but rather an idea, often by form of pictorial representation. We may find on our sign:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="591" height="372" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MenT.png" alt="" srcset="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MenT.png 591w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MenT-300x189.png 300w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MenT-560x352.png 560w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px"></figure></div>


<p>Because in each case the word is accompanied by the same ideogram, our alien friends may develop a certain confidence that “men” is quite the same as “MEN”, and a suspicion that grammatical markers such as the possessive don’t mean all that much. Assuming that they find enough toilet signs, the aliens will be able to establish a relationship between the word “men” and the stick figure, even if they do not yet know the equivalent in their own language. They will also know that M/m, E/e, and N/n are the same letters in other contexts, and that a final -’s can be a grammatical marker. And, though no doubt quite different from their tentacled bodies, once they have dug up a grave or two, or seen any art that has survived the conflagrating years, they might even realise that this symbol represents a human body.</p>



<p>They may even be lucky enough to find this corresponding set of signs:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="519" height="359" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WomenT.png" alt="" srcset="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WomenT.png 519w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WomenT-300x208.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px"></figure></div>


<p>As these look much the same, in format, as signs for the men’s room, our aliens might reasonably guess that they both serve the same purpose. If they have further discerned anything about how people dressed in the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries, they might even recognise that these stereotyped images appear to be wearing a dress or skirt, conventionally associated with women and girls. Even if they can’t read it, they can tentatively suggest that MEN is the word for “man” and WOMEN the word for “women”, in this system. But already we see how tricky this is: they will have no inkling that both are plural.</p>



<p>Let us return to earth for a moment. Because Linear B is a syllabary, and not an alphabet, there are other forms of internal evidence available. This process can be illustrated in English by a word we are still inclined to decline for number and gender:</p>


<p>alumnus (masculine, singular)</p>
<p>alumni (masculine, plural)</p>
<p>alumna (feminine, singular)</p>
<p>alumnae (feminine, plural)</p>


<p>If we break this word down into syllables, we get:</p>


<p>a-lum-nus</p>
<p>a-lum-ni</p>
<p>a-lum-na</p>
<p>a-lum-nae</p>


<p>If we assign arbitrary Greek letters to each syllable, for the sake of illustration, we get:</p>


<p>α λ μ</p>
<p>α λ ν</p>
<p>α λ ξ</p>
<p>α λ π</p>


<p>In each case only the final sign of the word has changed, so we might perhaps think that, rather than representing completely different words, these are forms of the same word, with the ending changing to tell us something about it. This is how nouns and adjectives work in inflected languages, like Latin and Greek, and is a feature that we generally replicate for loanwords. But even though each sign stands for a complete syllable, a consonant plus a vowel, our knowledge of inflected languages will suggest to us that what is changing is not both sounds, but only the vowel: the consonant remains consistent. Each of these signs, then, belongs to the same consonant series. Even though we do not know which consonant it is, nor which vowel in each case, we can surmise that μ, ν, ξ, and π are all related. We can visualize this relationship in a grid, as so:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Vowel 1 (u)</td><td>Vowel 2 (i)</td><td>Vowel 3 (a)</td><td>Vowel 4 (ae)</td></tr><tr><td>Consonant 1 (n)</td><td>μ (nus)</td><td>ν (ni)</td><td>ξ (na)</td><td>π (nae)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>This is not yet much to go by: but, like the aliens puzzling out toilet signs, we have some other tricks to hand. Mycenaean records are chiefly accounting documents, and rich in numbers. These are quite obvious, being expressed by a tally system not unlike what we use today. So we might find:</p>


<p>α λ μ | (a-lum-nus 1)</p>
<p>α λ ν || (a-lum-ni 2)</p>
<p>α λ ξ | (a-lum-na 1)</p>
<p>α λ π ||| (a-lum-nae 3)</p>


<p>Now we know that both -μ and -ξ represent the singular, and so should belong to different genders, while -ν and -π represent plurals. Here is good evidence that we do indeed have an inflected language. But which plural goes with which singular? Luckily, we find:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="512" height="298" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBT.png" alt="" srcset="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBT.png 512w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBT-300x175.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></figure></div>


<p>Following the aliens, if we guess that the first stick figure represents a man and the second a women, it seems that -μ and -ν belong to a masculine declension, -ξ and -π to a feminine. We can even build a basic declension table:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Singular</td><td>Plural</td></tr><tr><td>Masculine</td><td>&nbsp;– μ</td><td>&nbsp;– ν&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Feminine</td><td>&nbsp;– ξ</td><td>&nbsp;– π&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>All of this without any idea of what the word means, or how to read it phonetically. Let us take another Latin loanword that we still treat right:</p>


<p>emeritus (masculine, singular)</p>
<p>emeriti (masculine, plural)</p>
<p>emerita (feminine, singular)</p>

<p>Now we have the same relationship between -τ and -υ (-tus and -ti), -φ and -χ (-ta and -tae) as we did between -μ and -ν (-nus and -ni), -ξ and -π (-ta and -tae). So our grid expands:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Vowel 1 (u)</td><td>Vowel 2 (i)</td><td>Vowel 3 (a)</td><td>Vowel 4 (ae)</td></tr><tr><td>Consonant 1 (n)</td><td>μ (nus)</td><td>ν (ni)</td><td>ξ (na)</td><td>π (nae)</td></tr><tr><td>Consonant 2 (t)</td><td>τ (tus)</td><td>υ (ti)</td><td>φ (ta)</td><td>χ (tae)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>We are, of course, playing with the benefit of hindsight. Our examples are perfectly chosen, and we know that we are right. It was rather harder the first time round. Two words, even with examples as tidy as we have here, are no basis for a true decipherment: we must be alert to coincidence, and never shape the evidence to fit our theories. Our work so far has resembled Alice Kober’s in her demonstration that declensional patterns repeated across words and tablets, and were not phantoms but proper sport for the hunt. Tedious it was, surely, but not entirely mechanical: it took a keen eye for patterns, and a mind like a steel trap.</p>



<p>Only once this path had been laid could Ventris establish his grid. It relied for its accuracy on the principle of inflexion; if this was wrong, the grid would fail. But if it was right, here was a sound method. Without ever guessing what these words should mean, or what they might sound like, relationships could be established between both words and signs. It is not glamorous, nor easy, and would fail if pushed too quickly. But once built, like Cinderella’s shoe, it would only fit the one true solution.</p>



<p>This was the drudgery of Bennett, Kober, and Ventris. Bennett established the sign list; Kober the evidence for declension; and Ventris the grid. All that remained were the sounds, and the language itself.</p>

<p><strong>Breakthrough</strong></p>



<p>By February 1952, Ventris’ grid had reached its third stage, with advances made by incorporating the new evidence from Pylos. He had charted 48 signs, and of these only 7 were wrong: he had his shoe, but still needed a princess.</p>



<p>Much was made, and still is, of the analytical nature of Ventris’ decipherment. It was touted as a great defence against his critics: here was the solution, not of fanciful guesswork, but stubborn and methodical cryptography. As we have seen, there was indeed a great deal of method; but the neatly-placed tinder caught fire with an imaginative spark.</p>



<p>In a CV syllabary, there is one type of sign that will almost always appear at the beginning of a word: the pure vowel. As in e-me-ri-tus and a-lum-nus, it is only at a word’s beginning that we are likely to have a vowel unaccompanied by a consonant. And, indeed, there were some signs that rarely appeared later in a word than its beginning. One especially had attracted a great deal of interest, initially for its resemblance to the Minoan double axe, now for its location and frequency. It had been suggested, and Ventris decided to play with the idea, that it might represent <em>a</em>.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="242" height="112" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBaxe-1.png" alt=""></figure></div>


<p>He was also toying with a few identifications based on similarities between Linear B and the later Cypriot syllabary. Though it seemed that these two systems were related, there was very limited overlap in signs, and certain aspects of the syllabary’s structure disguised that both systems were used to write the same language. But Ventris got lucky:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="490" height="190" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB11.png" alt="" srcset="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB11.png 490w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB11-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px"><figcaption><em>Hypothetical equivalences between Cypriot Syllabic (left) and Linear B (right) signs.</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Adding to his confidence in the identification of <em>na</em> was that <em>-n-</em> was used in Etruscan adjectives and verbs; but the grid was foolproof, and if a guess was right it did not really matter if the reasoning was wrong. This was a point that many of his critics failed to grasp.</p>



<p>Because he had now placed the consonant <em>n</em> and the vowel <em>i, </em>his grid gave him the sign likely to represent <em>ni</em>:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="251" height="101" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB4.png" alt=""></figure></div>


<p>But how to test the theory? The cryptographer’s greatest ally is the proper noun, which tends to be spelled out phonetically in more or less the same way no matter which writing system is in use. Even if one could not read Greek, they could have a crack at the word Ἀλέξανδρος if told that it is equivalent to Alexander: λ = l, ε = e, and so on. Difficulties appear at the end, but eight of ten letters can still be established with reasonable confidence. It was indeed the identification of the name Cleopatra in Egyptian hieroglyphs that was Champollion’s essential clue.</p>



<p>Now Ventris had no idea what anyone in the tablets may have been named; but even better than personal names are place names, which exhibit the same features and are often remarkably tenacious. Just northeast of Knossos is Amnisos, where Odysseus claims the winds took him while passing Cape Malea. The <em>Odyssey</em>-Poet places a cave of Eileithyia there, and in the 1930s Spyridon Marinatos had excavated Minoan remains at the site and identified it as the port of Knossos. This name seemed more likely than most to appear in the Knossos tablets.</p>

<p>Ventris had already suggested that certain words may be place names: they were repeated frequently, in association with various commodities, but were not personal names, and did not appear at Pylos. He had floated the suggestion to John Myres in February, and could not shake it. In a letter to Emmett Bennett dated 26 April 1952, Ventris has put his foot on the right step, but not yet committed his weight:</p>





<p><span>I expect you’ve fully sorted these out already. It would be a wonderful thing if one could sit down on the hill at Knossos and know just what the names of all the surrounding towns &amp; villages were in L(ate) M(inoan); because I’m sure some of them must occur in this series. I’m still rather intrigued by AMNISOS for </span><span>a-mi-ni-so</span><span>, which is the only B group with initial </span><span>a</span><span>– and </span><span>-ni</span><span>– as 3rd except </span><span>a-pa</span><span>–</span><span>ni</span><span>-x — &amp; this name too should occur, surely. Amnios is generally spoken of as the port of Knossos, but I gather there was a nearer harbour at the mouth of the valley? The frequent </span><span>a-mi-ni-so-do</span><span> = </span><span>AT</span><span> AMNISOS? i.e. = at a separate royal depot?? Who are the </span><span>ki-ri-re-wi-ja-i</span><span> who are mentioned after </span><span>ko-no-so</span><span> (KNOSSOS?&gt;?) and who recut at Pylos? — </span><span>ciliθeviia — </span><span>“peasants, locals, ??” (Etc cilθ, “land, country”).</span></p>
<p><span>Yours, Michael Ventris<span onmouseover="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_2')" onfocus="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_2')" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_2')" onfocusout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_2')"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_24922_1('footnote_plugin_reference_24922_1_2');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_24922_1_2">[2]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_2" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_2')">He has in fact already come a long way here, as Etruscan <em>ciliθeviia </em>is a nearly-enough plausible reading of the sequence <em>ki-ri-te-wi-ja-i</em>.</span></span></span></p>



<p>If <em>a </em>and <em>n-</em> were right, then the top word could be read <em>a-x-n.-x</em>. If it were to be Amnisos, our <em>n- </em>sign must be <em>ni</em>, so <em>a-x-ni-x.</em> A glance at the grid would reveal that the second sign should have the same vowel as <em>ni. </em>In a CV syllabary, consonant clusters are always a problem, but they are sometimes resolved by ‘dead vowels’, often borrowed from a neighbouring sign. So the -mn- of Amnisos might be writing –<em>mi-ni-</em>. This was quite promising, and with the final sign provisionally read as <em>so</em>, he had his name.</p>



<p>From luck to rigour: by identifying <em>mi, ni, </em>and <em>so</em>, Ventris had locked in the consonant for the entire <em>m-</em>, <em>n-</em>, and <em>s-</em> series, and all signs with the vowels <em>-i </em>and <em>-o</em>. Any further hypotheses would have to respect these values: anything that required more than a minor adjustment here or there to account for human error would necessarily be wrong.</p>



<p>Another likely place name could now be half-read:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="291" height="186" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB5.png" alt=""></figure></div>


<p>The final sign, as in <em>a-mi-ni-so, </em>must be <em>so</em>, and according to the grid each had the vowel <em>-o</em>. What’s more, the second sign belonged to the <em>n-</em>series. So this should be read: <em>.o-no.-so</em>. Given the principle of dead vowels already suggested, it is hard not to suggest <em>ko-no-so</em>: Knossos (Κνωσός). This involved guesswork, but always within the rules that Ventris had set for himself. It was never arbitrary, and if it required certain spelling rules (dead vowels, omission of final <em>-s</em>), then these were at least consistent.</p>



<p>So far, so good: but as we are merely dealing with place names, there is nothing here that is at all very Greek. But ominous clouds had appeared on the horizon. Certain words showed a variation at the end between the <em>-o</em> vowel and the –<em>a </em>vowel, which looked suspiciously like the Greek neuter declension (<em>-on</em> singular, <em>-a</em> plural; once again we must neglect the final consonant). And Kober’s triplets, too, began to look suspiciously like Greek adjectives:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="601" height="333" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB12.png" alt="" srcset="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB12.png 601w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB12-300x166.png 300w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB12-560x310.png 560w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px"></figure></div>


<p>These could now be read: <em>a-mi-ni-so, a-mi-ni-si-.o, a-mi-ni-si-.a</em>; <em>ko-no-so, ko-no-si-jo, ko-no-si-.a</em>. The consonant of the final sign was not obvious, but if it were <em>j</em>– (pronounced /y/, as in German) it might stand for a sort of glide between two vowels. This would give us adjectives of the type –<em>i(j)os, i(j)a</em>, perfectly formed Greek masculine and feminines (as in the word for “saint”, <em>ayios</em> vs <em>ayia</em>, in many modern Greek place names: Ayios Nikolaos, but Ayia Triada).</p>



<p>Now to search for Greek words. One of the basic items of Mycenaean vocabulary, established early by Kober on much the same principle as our aliens working on toilet signs, were the words for “boy” and “girl”:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="274" height="281" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB7.png" alt="" srcset="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB7.png 274w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB7-50x50.png?crop=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px"></figure></div>


<p>These could be read <em>ko-.o</em> and <em>ko-.a</em>. Again, a promising variation between –<em>o(s)</em> and <em>-a</em> to distinguish masculine and feminine. As anyone who has ever visited the museums of Athens knows, a sculpture of a youthful man is called a <em>kouros</em>, of a woman a <em>kore</em>. Ventris, who had no more Greek than he had left school with and who disclaimed any philological expertise, nonetheless knew that the differences in the first syllable were the result of a disappearing consonant: the words had originally been *<em>korwos</em> and *<em>korwa</em>. The spelling was difficult, but as the final signs shared the same consonant, it was quite possible that these words should be read <em>ko-wo, ko(r)wo(s)</em>, and <em>ko-wa</em>, <em>ko(r)wa</em>.</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="894" height="587" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBKor.png" alt="" srcset="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBKor.png 894w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBKor-300x197.png 300w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBKor-768x504.png 768w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBKor-700x460.png 700w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBKor-609x400.png 609w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LBKor-560x368.png 560w" sizes="(max-width: 894px) 100vw, 894px"><figcaption><em>The most famous kouros and kore pair in the world, possibly brother and sister, found together, in 1972 at the cemetery of Merenda (ancient Myrrhinous) in Attica.

<p>A great deal of the grid had now fallen into place, and the more Ventris looked the more Greek he found. Having identified the sign ­<em>jo</em>, a number of men’s names that ended in <em>-jo-jo</em> could now be explained as genitives (Homeric <em>-οιο</em>, –<em>oio</em>), and the <em>w-</em>series gave the key to the vowel <em>u</em> and a complicated series of archaic nouns in –<em>eus</em>.</p>



<p>This is tough stuff, and gets very technical very fast. Given the holes that remained, it is unsurprising that Ventris had his hesitations. He had entered a great catacomb with only a small torch, and it was not obvious that his light would last long enough to see him out. But, most tellingly of all, one of his great reservations reflected an error not in his method but merely his philology. This was the sign that he now had to read as <em>qe</em>:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="202" height="161" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB8.png" alt=""></figure></div>


<p>This sign regularly appears after the second of two items, often accompanied by the number two, and in that respect almost certainly reflects a conjunction. Greek had a particle which served this function, but this was <em>te</em> (τε), not <em>qe</em>. What Ventris did not know was that Greek had once had the letter <em>q</em> (k<sup>w</sup>), but in time it had become either <em>t</em> or <em>p</em> (compare the word for “four” in Latin and Greek: <em>quattuor</em> vs <em>tettara</em>; of for “five”: <em>quinque</em> vs <em>pente</em>). So <em>qe</em> was in fact the correct earlier form.</p>



<p>Such nagging doubts may have delayed the Work Note’s postage: in a letter to Bennett of 7 June, 1952, Ventris makes no mention of his breakthrough. It is not in fact clear when he realised that Mycenaean still preserved these labiovelars, though this discovery may be the subject of a famous anecdote. On an “evening early in June”, he and his wife Lois had invited over Michael Smith, a fellow architect, and his wife Prudence, who had just completed her degree in <em>Literae Humaniores</em> at Somerville College, Oxford. Lois was left to play the host, plying the guests with sherry, while Michael remained at work rather longer than the rules of good hosting would dictate. At last he emerged from his study, too excited properly to be bashful: “I know it, I <em>know</em> it, I am certain of it.” Over dinner he shared the topic of his certainty, and afterwards took the Classicist Prudence into his study to share his notes and findings.</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="442" height="631" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MVHam.png" alt="" srcset="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MVHam.png 442w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MVHam-210x300.png 210w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MVHam-280x400.png 280w" sizes="(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px"><figcaption><em>The Hampstead (North London) home that Michael Ventris’ wife Lois designed (she was also an architect), where they lived from 1952.</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>It is not clear what, exactly, prompted his certainty on that evening. Nor even can we be sure quite what evening it was; but so long as “early June” is right, it must have been after Work Note 20 was completed. But by 18 June, when he finally shared the decipherment with Bennett, he had given 𐀤 the value <em>pe</em>, which represents a possible reflex of the labiovelar in later Greek. A possible explanation for one of his sticking points in Work Note 20 may well have been the tipping point.</p>



<p>Whatever his breakthrough, Prudence, who knew more Greek than Ventris, was quickly convinced by what she saw, and became an important proselytizer for the decipherment. After her degree she had taken a job with the BBC, and by her fervour convinced her rather sceptical colleagues that Ventris should announce his decipherment on the air. And so he did, on the first of July:</p>


<p>During the last few weeks, I have suddenly come to the conclusion that the Knossos and Pylos tablets must, after all, be written in Greek: a difficult and archaic Greek, seeing as it is 500 years earlier than Homer, and written in a rather abbreviated form; but Greek nonetheless.</p>


<p>This is not how most would have made the announcement. Here was a great claim, sure to be controversial, presented publicly without supporting evidence. Many listeners no doubt dismissed it. But at Oxford a young philologist named John Chadwick heard digammas where he expected them, and wanted a closer look.</p>

<p><strong>A helping hand arrives</strong></p>



<p>Chadwick (1920–98), the son of a civil servant, had been educated at St Paul’s School, where he was a classmate of Kenneth Dover (1920–2010), before going up to Corpus Christi, Cambridge in 1939. War and the fall of France soon intervened, and he enlisted with the Royal Navy; but in 1942 he was swept away to Alexandria and secret intelligence work, where he did not limit his efforts to the codes he was supposed to break, rather to the embarrassment of some at Bletchley Park. After the Italian surrender he joined that team, where he had to learn much Japanese technical vocabulary relating to submarines. Through this process he learned a great deal about how codes are broken, and how a decipherment might grow from a few words to an entire message.</p>

He would stay in this post until 1951, when Arthur Beattie left Cambridge for the Greek chair at Edinburgh and Chadwick was appointed to his old position.</p>



<p>And so it was that he was preparing a course of lectures on the Greek dialects when he heard Ventris’ announcement – another of history’s happy accidents. After the war ended, he had, with friends, tried his hand at Linear B, but found that too little had been published. Since moving to Oxford he had been in touch with Myres, from whom he was able to acquire a copy of Work Note 20. He didn’t expect much, but soon found that Ventris’ suggested values produced, like a half-broken wartime code, islands of sense in a sea of confusion. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime Myres had told Ventris of this interested new party, and Ventris soon wrote to Chadwick, suggesting rather modestly that “if you find any points of contact between your work and mine, it would be very interesting to have to the opportunity of exchanging views.” Chadwick’s response has become rather famous:</p>





<p><span>Dear Mr. Ventris,</span></p>
<p>Let me first offer you my congratulations on having solved the Minoan problem, it is a magnificent achievement and you are yet only at the beginning of your triumph…</p>



<p>The advantage of Chadwick’s philological acumen was immediately on display. Two sign groups, one a place name very common at Pylos and the other apparently a prefix, had resisted Ventris’ efforts:</p>


<div>
<figure data-coblocks-animation="fadeIn"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="263" height="357" src="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB13.png" alt="" srcset="https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB13.png 263w, https://antigonejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LB13-221x300.png 221w" sizes="(max-width: 263px) 100vw, 263px"><figcaption><em>Two problematic sign-groups: </em>p.-ro<em> and </em>a-p.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The problem was the sign 𐀢: the consonant had to be <em>p</em>-, but the vowel remained obscure. If given the value <em>pu</em>, then the first group could be read as <em>pu-ro</em>, Πύλος (Pylos), a name still missing. But then the second group, which one might rather want to read as later Greek ἀπο- (<em>apo</em>, “from”) must be the rather strange <em>a-pu</em>, ἀπυ-. Ventris’ thoughts on the matter are not recorded, but Chadwick knew that in certain dialectal inscriptions one found ἀπύ (<em>apu</em>) in place of Attic ἀπό (<em>apo</em>). This was quite remarkable confirmation: at one stroke both the name Pylos and a common preposition were both restored. It is little wonder that Chadwick was so readily and eagerly convinced.</p>



<p>His enthusiasm proved salutary. Ventris had stepped quite boldly to the edge of a cliff, and only in doing so realised just how precipitous was the drop:&nbsp;</p>




<p>Dear Mr Chadwick,<br>Thank you very much for your letter. It is very encouraging to hear from someone who has been working on the Minoan problem that they agree with the Greek approach; because frankly at the moment I feel rather in need of moral support. The whole issue is getting to the stage where a lot of people will be looking at it very skeptically, and I’m conscious that there’s a lot which so far can’t be very satisfactorily explained. There’s a kind of central area of sense, but still a great periphery which is baffling.</p>


<p><strong>New evidence provides a handle:</strong></p>



<p>Still, there was some cause for hope. Blegen’s excavations at Pylos, abandoned after 1939 with the onset of the War, had resumed that summer, and 400 new tablets were found. These, which Ventris had never seen, would provide an independent check on his work: “I feel sure that if there’s something in this vocabulary, then there should be pretty clear confirmation of it in the new material.”</p>



<p>And so Ventris sent his sign-list to Blegen, but did not remain idle. He had already reached out to the <em>Journal of Hellenic Studies</em> as a possible venue for the publication of his decipherment, and asked Chadwick to collaborate on the article. Two drafts, one meeting in Cambridge, and a great deal of cautious criticism later, the manuscript of “Evidence for Greek Dialect in the Minoan Archives” was sent to the <em>JHS</em> for typesetting in early November 1952. The result was, in the words of Rhys Carpenter, “highly condensed, almost unreadable, barely comprehensible, but thoroughly sensational.”</p>



<p>The central contention of “Evidence” was framed modestly but not without confidence: “A complete decipherment is still a long way off; but we hope to produce sufficient evidence to show that we are dealing with a true Greek dialect.” But in the time between its submission in November of 1952 and publication in the summer of 1953, Blegen and the 1952 tablets had entered the picture with dramatic results.</p>



<p>Linear B tablets were not written for posterity. Inscribed on moist clay, they were left to dry and filed away for a year, it seems, or two: never more. It is only by a historical irony that they are preserved at all, baked hard by the very fires that destroyed the palaces. Though the archive rooms at Pylos give no sign of deliberate ransacking, the collapse and conflagration of the building was hardly gentle on the tablets inside. Many were found broken, with a thick covering of hard lime, further souvenir of the fire, obscuring the signs. So it was that none of the tablets found in 1952 could be read before significant conservation work. This was accomplished over the winter of 1952–3, and no one saw them in those long months except the museum staff engaged in this task. But in March of 1953, Blegen returned to Athens, and was able to investigate the newly cleaned and mended tablets.</p>



<p>With Ventris’s proposed values in hand, a tablet that had been found in two halves that June caught his eye:</p>


<div>

<p>He wrote to Ventris: </p>


<p>Enclosed for your information is a copy of P641, which you may find interesting. It evidently deals with pots, some with three legs, some with four handles, some with three, and others without handles. The first word seems by your system seems to be <em>ti-ri-po-de</em> and it recurs twice as <em>ti-ri-po</em> (singular?). The four-handled pot is preceded by <em>qe-to-ro-we</em>, the three-handled by <em>ti-ri-wo-we</em> or <em>ti-ri-jo-we</em>, the handleless pot by <em>a-no-we</em>. All this seems too good to be true. Is coincidence excluded?… I should like to hear what you make of this inscription.</p>


<p>Ventris was not normally an excitable man, but this did the job. He called Chadwick immediately to share the news, and though his modesty was not quite overcome, but he now held such evidence that all, in Chadwick’s later words, “who were unprejudiced could now be convinced that the system worked.”</p>





<p>The confirmation that it offered was in the form of the remarkable agreement between the proposed Greek values and the illustrations. Next to a picture of a three-footed vessel and the numeral two was the word <em>ti-ri-po-de</em>, quite transparently the Greek plural <em>tripodes</em> (τρίποδες), “tripods” – literally “three feet”. <span onmouseover="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_4')" onfocus="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_4')" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_4')" onfocusout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_4')"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_24922_1('footnote_plugin_reference_24922_1_4');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_24922_1_4">[4]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_4" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_4')">Alternatively, τρίποδε, the archaic dual declension that referred exclusively to two of something.</span></span> And, if we doubted the declension, next to a three-footed vessel with the numeral one, <em>ti-ri-po</em>, the singular <em>tripos</em> (τρίπος; cf. Attic τρίπους).</p>



<p>A vessel with four handles is called <em>qe-to-ro-we. </em>The first element is the numeral four (<em>k<sup>w</sup>etr-</em>; cf. Latin <em>quattuor</em>, Attic <em>tettares</em>, τέτταρες after <em>*k<sup>w</sup></em>– &gt; t-), the second a form of the word “ear”, already in Homer used of the handles of vessels.

<p>From 1953 to 1956 Ventris was in high demand: the Institute of Classical Studies founded its Mycenaean Seminar; the first international colloquium on Mycenology (as the discipline came to be known) was held at Gif-sur-Yvette, south of Paris; and time had to be made for a visit to Buckingham Palace to receive an OBE from the Queen. And all the while there was writing to be done: he worked closely with Chadwick on <em>Documents in Mycenaean Greek</em>, which remains unsurpassed in its breadth and ambition to make the technical details of the tablets intelligible to the educated reader.<span onmouseover="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_8')" onfocus="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_8')" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_8')" onfocusout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_8')"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_24922_1('footnote_plugin_reference_24922_1_8');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_24922_1_8">[8]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_8" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_8')">Today it is generally the second edition of 1973, made necessary by the rapid development of the discipline in its first two decades, to which scholars turn. It is of course outdated: but not obsolete.</span></span> Chadwick delivered the typescript to Cambridge University Press in July 1955. Ventris was in Greece, and so had to be notified by postcard – written in Linear B. The script could not just be read again: it could be written, and after 3,000 years given the breath of new life.</p>

<p>John to Michael: Greetings!<br>Today I have given the book <br>to the typesetters.<br>May it go well for us!</p>
<p>At the Bridge of Cam, on day 7<br>Of the month of June.</p>


<p>But Ventris would not see the book published. Early in the morning of 6 September, 1956, he collided with a parked lorry while driving and was killed instantly. He was 34: ὃν οἱ θεοὶ φιλοῦσιν ἀποθνῄσκει νεός.<span onmouseover="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_9')" onfocus="footnote_tooltip_show('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_9')" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_9')" onfocusout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_9')"><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_24922_1('footnote_plugin_reference_24922_1_9');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_24922_1_9">[9]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_9" onmouseout="footnote_tooltip_hide('footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_24922_1_9')">“He whom the gods love dies young.”</span></span></p>



<p>It is on this sad note that the story of the decipherment tends to end. And it is true that, with the publication of the Tripod Tablet in 1954, Ventris’ work won wide (though not universal) acceptance. In many ways the work that has followed since was of a different sort. The basic values of the core signs were known. The great challenge was now interpretation – and this continues today. So, too, does the decipherment: rare signs, often restricted to personal names or toponyms, still defy a fixed phonetic value. New finds are still made, though slower than many would like, and our understanding of these terse and archaic documents evolves with our understanding of the Mycenaean world more broadly.</p>

<p><strong>Further Reading</strong></p>



<p>The debt that this essay owes to previous work will be obvious to all who read it, even presented as it is without a traditional scholarly apparatus. To render that debt explicit, and as a guide to the curious, I include this list of suggested reading.</p>



<p><em>Correspondence and Historical Documents</em></p>



<p>The Program in Aegean Scripts and Prehistory at the University of Texas has digitised a significant collection of letters between many of the principal actors in the story of decipherment, including Michael Ventris, Alice Kober, Emmett Bennett, John Chadwick. These can all be found <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/2152/11681" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. The value of this resource cannot be expressed without resort to rather dramatic hyperbole. A few letters, including Chadwick’s first letter to Ventris, have been digitised by the <a href="https://www.classics.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/mycep/archive/correspondence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Faculty of Classics</a> at the University of Cambridge.</p>



<p>None of this correspondence has been published systematically, though it is frequently quoted and reproduced in biographical and historical studies (for which see below). The few publications focussed on correspondence are:</p>



<p>Lisa M. Bendall, <em>The Decipherment of Linear B and the Ventris-Chadwick Correspondence </em>(Fitzwilliam Museum Catalogue, Cambridge, 2003. (Images of many letters are reproduced, but unfortunately not in very high quality.)</p>



<p>Rupert Thompson, “The Ventris–Chadwick Correspondence and the Decipherment of Linear B: A Denier, A Dissenter and A Dubious Conclusion,” <em>Cambridge Classical Journal </em>65 (2019) 173–99.</p>



<p>Ventris’ Work Notes were compiled and published by Anna Sacconi, <em>Work Notes on Minoan Language Research and Other Unedited Papers</em> (Edizioni dell’Ateneo, Rome, 1988.They are invaluable for anyone working on the history of the decipherment, but do not make for light reading. Included are also a few letters from and to Ventris, and the text of his full radio announcement. The actual announcement can be heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOOGJAQ4eg4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p><em>Biographies</em></p>



<p>Both Ventris and Kober have been the subject of biographies in the past twenty years. These were written by journalists, not scholars, with the advantage that they are generally accessible and affordable, but they can tend towards the speculative or sensational. They are both very valuable when taken <em>cum grano salis</em>:</p>



<p>Margalit Fox, <em>The Riddle of the Labyrinth </em>(Profile Books, London, 2013). (<a href="https://doi.org/10.2972/hesperia.87.1.0001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tracy 2018</a> offers a valuable rebuttal to the claims that Blegen deliberately kept Pylos material from Kober.)</p>



<p>Andrew Robinson, <em>The Man who Deciphered Linear B </em>(Thames and Hudson, London, 2005). (Best read with Lisa Bendall’s <a href="https://www.academia.edu/4501110/Review_of_The_Man_Who_Deciphered_Linear_B_The_Story_of_Michael_Ventris_by_A_Robinson_Journal_of_Hellenic_Studies_125_203_5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>JHS</em> review</a>.)</p>



<p><em>Accounts of the Decipherment</em></p>



<p>Ventris never produced a full account of his own process (which explains, <em>inter alia</em>, why we do not know how he worked out the labio-velar series). After his death, the task of explaining and defending his friend’s work was left to Chadwick, who produced the first and still best account of the decipherment. Anyone who has read this far should probably find themself a copy: John Chadwick, <em>The Decipherment of Linear B</em> (Cambridge UP. 1958, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. 1967).</p>



<p><em>The Crunchy Stuff</em></p>



<p>All of the above was written for the curious but Greekless reader. Those with Greek may enjoy <em>Documents</em>, though its age and stages of revision make it a difficult first introduction. The best introduction to Linear B in English is the three-volume Peeter’s Companion, aimed (and, unfortunately, priced) for academics: Yves Duhoux &amp; Anna Morpurgo-Davies, <em>A Companion to Linear B: Mycenaean Greek Texts and Their World</em> (3 vols, Peeters, Louvain, 2008–14).</p>



<p>Those looking for something cheaper will find much value in Hooker’s <em>Introduction</em>. Though dated, it remains the most concise and convenient introduction to the grammar of Mycenaean Greek: J.T. Hooker, <em>Linear B: An Introduction </em>(Bristol Classical Press, 1980).</p>

<p>Oslo, Norway –<strong> Greenpeace Nordic and Natur og Ungdom (Young Friends of the Earth Norway) secured a historic win against the Norwegian State, rendering the approvals of three oil and gas fields in the North Sea invalid.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In November 2023, environmental organisation Greenpeace Nordic and youth group Natur og Ungdom took the Norwegian State to court once again. The organisations argued that recent approvals of three new oil and gas fields, Breidablikk, Yggdrasil and Tyrving, all in the North Sea, violate the Norwegian Constitution, European Economic Area law and Norway’s international human rights commitments. They also argued the Ministry of Energy failed to consider the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child during the approval of the fields, thus rendering the approvals invalid.</p>
<p>“I am extremely pleased and relieved that the Court has delivered such a positive and thorough judgement. The judgement establishes that the Breidablikk, Yggdrasil and Tyrving oil and gas fields were approved on an illegal basis and that production must be stopped immediately. We expect a halt to all further developments,” said <strong>Frode Pleym, Head of Greenpeace, Norway</strong></p>
<p>Specifically, the organisations pointed to the fact that impact assessments of the three oil and gas fields’ global climate effects, which the Ministry of Energy is required to carry out, are either highly inadequate or non-existent.</p>
<p>The judgement delivered today by the Oslo District Court, has found the approvals of all three oil and gas fields invalid and issued an injunction forbidding the state from granting any new permits necessary to construct and produce from the fields.[1]&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This is an important victory for current and future generations and the environment. With this judgement, millions of barrels of oil will remain in the ground. During the trial, the State tried to diminish the impact of the emissions&nbsp; Breidablikk, Tyrving and Yggdrasil would have globally. As confirmed by the court’s decision, emissions from the oil fields would have catastrophic effects on the global climate, on people and the planet. We are pleased the oil and gas will remain untouched in the ground, instead of further exacerbating climate disasters,” said <strong>Gytis Blaževičius, Head of Natur og Ungdom.</strong></p>
<p>The Court also emphasised procedural problems of the approval process, highlighting the lack of adequate public participation, and found that the approvals were inadequate under EU law. and that “combustion emissions [from] petroleum extraction are such a significant and particularly characteristic consequence of such projects that they must clearly be considered indirect climate impacts within the meaning of the (EU) Project Directive”.</p>
<p>The Court confirmed that the government violated legal precedent from the Norwegian Supreme Court, by not subjecting combustion emissions to an environmental impact assessment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Court held that the children’s right to be heard would be safeguarded through public hearings that must take place in connection with lawfully required environmental impact assessments. Anticipating <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/58956/first-climate-case-heard-at-the-european-court-of-human-rights/">clarifications from the Grand Chamber</a> of the European Court of Human Rights, the District Court refrained from assessing violations of the Convention.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>More and more people, particularly those most impacted by climate change, are using the law to protect their rights from the climate crisis. This ruling becomes another substantial reference point for all climate lawsuits pending around the world.</p><p>ENDS</p></div>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<p>[1] Specifically, the court ruled that section 20 et seq. of the Petroleum Regulations, which provide the requirement on impact assessments, must be interpreted in light of Article 112 of the Norwegian Constitution. It referred to the 2020 Supreme Court decision that found that Article 112 should cover both emissions from the production and consumption of petroleum, even if it is combusted outside of Norway. The Court found that the State must assess the real impact of both forms of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the development and operation of petroleum deposits before approving oil and gas fields and that a real test must be carried out of whether approval would be contrary to Article 112 of the Norwegian Constitution.&nbsp;</p>
