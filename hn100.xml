<p dir="auto">Hi! I am an Iranian Software Engineer, and in this torn paper note, I want to talk about
some funny moments I had online related to the fact that I was spawned in this specific region of the world: Iran.</p>

<p dir="auto">Back when I was a student, I got access to the <a href="https://imaginecup.microsoft.com/en-us" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Imagine</a>, and as a result, I got
access to the Microsoft Store as a developer. This inspired me write one of my open-source projects called <a href="https://github.com/avestura/EyesGuard">EyesGuard</a>
and publish it on Microsoft Store. However, one day, somebody told me that they can no longer find EyesGuard on the store.</p>
<p dir="auto">I came to the realization that Microsoft deleted my app, my developer account, and all those comments on my app supporting me and suggesting
ideas on how to improve the program. I tried to contact the support and email whoever I could, but I was ghosted.
Nobody ever explained to me why, but I assume it's because of the sanctions.</p>

<p dir="auto">Notion is a great product, and it was the primary tool I used to manage my personal notes. Not until they suddenly decided to
wipe out every data related to the users residing in Iran. Hopefully, they actually responded to my support message:</p>

<p dir="auto">I read hackernews on a daily basis and I visit lots of different websites regularly. I am almost always on my VPN as I am internally firewalled by
the government and externally shooed because of the sanctions, so I am probably missing some of these heart-warming messages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Iranian IPs are blocked here, due to your decision to arm Russia with drones so that they can indiscriminately massacre civilians.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">My VPN turned off, and opening <a href="https://www.grepular.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.grepular.com</a> showed me this message. I actually do not blame the people who do this. I think there is
a fundamental misconception that people think because "Islamic Republic" has the word "Republic" in it, it must be a government of people in charge. That's not the case. I have yet to see anyone who actually supports Russian aggression in my real life in Iran.
Funny enough, Iran's history is full of backstabs by the Russian government.</p>
<p dir="auto">I tried contacting the author by sending this email:</p>
<pre><code>Hi Mark,

I hope this message finds you well.

While browsing HackerNews, I came across your website but was greeted with this message:

&gt; Iranian IPs are blocked here, due to your decision to arm Russia with drones so that they can indiscriminately massacre civilians.

I wanted to clarify that the decision to support Russia does not represent the Iranian people. That "your decision" refers to the regime, a theocratic minority that rules Iran without democratic legitimacy. The people of Iran have long protested and revolted against this regime, but unfortunately, they face brutal suppression while unarmed.

In my experience, most Iranians around me, including myself, stand firmly with Ukraine and against Russian aggression.

I’m not asking you to reconsider the IP restriction, you have your reasons and I respect that. I simply wanted to share this perspective and express my solidarity with Ukraine.

Slava Ukraini!

Best regards,
Avestura

<p dir="auto">I woke up to the news that GitHub has removed the access of Iranians to their private repositories. Well, that was not good. I tried to launch my own self-hosted instance of Gitea to reduce the damage. However, later, GitHub announced that <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/policy-news-and-insights/advancing-developer-freedom-github-is-fully-available-in-iran/" rel="nofollow">github is now available in Iran</a> by securing a license from the US government, and we're now good. You see? The weather is good, the birds are singing, GitHub is free again. Fantastic!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">GitLab freaked me out</h2><a id="user-content-gitlab-freaked-me-out" aria-label="Permalink: GitLab freaked me out" href="#gitlab-freaked-me-out"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Similarly, GitLab banned every account that once accessed from an Iranian IP, however, to this day, they never lifted the
ban, even on public repositories. I guess they couldn't secure a license from the US government, or they simply never cared.
Good luck to them in either case, though. GitLab is an amazing software. One can always self-host it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">List goes on</h2><a id="user-content-list-goes-on" aria-label="Permalink: List goes on" href="#list-goes-on"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The list goes on, and almost all of the services you probabelly heard of is banned here: Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, ...),
Educational platforms (coursera, udemy, etc), Payment software (stripe, paypal, ...).</p>

<p dir="auto">I don't think any of these companies have bad intentions towards any group of people. They are a business after all. They don't hate their customers; they are just playing the game, and the game has such rules.
But if someday some law or government forces me to prevent my services from a group, I'll think twice before writing those <code>if</code> statements. I'll try to have more empathy. People behind those screens are more important than just some rows in my tables.</p>

<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Important</p><p dir="auto">In this text, I am NOT asking for the removal of
the sanctions targeted at the Islamic Republic of Iran. I am merely remembering some moments on top of my head.
For the record, I do not support
the actions of the Islamic Republic, and on the contrary, I am in favor of the movements that release the people from such
a mafia-like cult ruling a country with thousands of years of history.
The actions of the group in charge of Iran are not defensible, and as a matter of fact,
the people of Iran are the first layer of victims. Some examples are listed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_the_Islamic_Republic_of_Iran" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
I especially feel it differently, as regime thugs put a gun to the throat of a dear person to me, and threatened to kill him if he showed up in

<h3 id="history-so-far">History so far</h3>
<p>Pocket Casts, people are not upset you are trying to find revenue sources. People are upset you are reneging on your promise.</p>
<p>You were a pay-once app. Released in 2011, pay once each for Android, iOS, and Web and keep for life.</p>
<p>In 2018 NPR <a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/607823388/pocket-cast-acquired?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">acquired you</a>.  Then in 2019 you moved to a subscription for all users, including the paid ones. People were upset so you backtracked and <a href="https://blog.pocketcasts.com/2019/09/18/major-new-update/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">grandfathered them into</a> a lifetime plus membership. Sadly, in 2020 NPR lost <a href="https://current.org/2021/01/public-media-owners-agree-to-sell-pocket-casts-podcast-platform/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">$800k from running you</a> so you were <a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2021/07/16/popular-podcast-app-pocket-casts-joins-automattic/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">sold to Automattic</a>.</p>
<p>In 2024, you renamed all "Pocket Casts Lifetime Members" to <a href="https://support.pocketcasts.com/knowledge-base/lifetime-access-to-pocket-casts-plus/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">"Pocket Casts Champions"</a> and we knew shenanigans were afoot.</p>
<p>This week you flipped the switch to turn on ads in the app:<br>
<img src="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/content/images/2025/09/1000002462.png" alt="1000002462.png" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>However, in 2022 you <a href="https://blog.pocketcasts.com/2022/10/19/pocket-casts-mobile-apps-are-now-open-source/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">made your mobile apps open source</a>, so there is something that can be done: I <a href="https://github.com/ciferkey/pocket-casts-android?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">forked</a> the repo.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="exorcising-the-ads">Exorcising the ads</h3>
<p>In the app you may be able to see the new nag that says: "Unlock folders, bookmarks, transcripts and more with Pocket Casts Plus" just above the artwork in the player screen. I don't see that exact string in the <a href="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/podcasts-you-altered-the-deal-so-i-will-alter-your-app/github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-android">GitHub repo</a>, I think that's because of internationalization.</p>
<p>However, I found where the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-android/blob/f17d2a0408dd299684eb4afa11fb07f4df1fc59e/modules/features/player/src/main/java/au/com/shiftyjelly/pocketcasts/player/view/PlayerHeaderFragment.kt?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com#L99">artwork view fragment is</a> and that it contains <code>AdAndArtworkHorizontal</code>. Looking at the changelog I can see that this was added in <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-android/pull/4086?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">Display ads in the player #4086</a> which created the flag <code>Feature.BANNER_ADS</code>.</p>
<p>In the project, a feature flag has the following details:</p>
<pre><code>enum class Feature(  
    val key: String,  
    val title: String,  
    val defaultValue: Boolean,  
    val tier: FeatureTier,  
    val hasFirebaseRemoteFlag: Boolean,  
    val hasDevToggle: Boolean,  
)
</code></pre>
<p>With some further updates to the project, the flag is now <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-android/blob/f17d2a0408dd299684eb4afa11fb07f4df1fc59e/modules/services/utils/src/main/java/au/com/shiftyjelly/pocketcasts/utils/featureflag/Feature.kt?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com#L125-L140">broken in two</a>:</p>
<pre><code>BANNER_ADS_PLAYER(  
    key = "banner_ad_player",  
    title = "Banner Ads Player",  
    defaultValue = true,  
    tier = FeatureTier.Free,  
    hasFirebaseRemoteFlag = true,  
    hasDevToggle = true,  
),  
BANNER_ADS_PODCASTS(  
    key = "banner_ad_podcasts",  
    title = "Banner Ads Podcasts",  
    defaultValue = true,  
    tier = FeatureTier.Free,  
    hasFirebaseRemoteFlag = true,  
    hasDevToggle = true,  
),
</code></pre>
<p>The flags are ultimately used by <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-android/blob/f17d2a0408dd299684eb4afa11fb07f4df1fc59e/modules/services/model/src/main/java/au/com/shiftyjelly/pocketcasts/models/type/BlazeAdLocation.kt?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com#L11">BlazeAdLocation</a>.</p>
<p>There are a couple of different ways we could slice out the ads. For testing, I went with the simplest approach to start:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flip <code>defaultValue</code> to false.</li>
<li>Flip <code>hasFirebaseRemoteFlag</code> to false so the flag will not be remotely overridden.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, based on the readme I just needed to<code>./gradlew :app:assembleDebugProd</code> and <code>./gradlew :app:installDebugProd</code>. This will install a different debug version of the app:<br>
<img src="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/content/images/2025/09/1000002460.png" alt="1000002460.png" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Voila, ads gone. Though in the future this process may be tougher because of Google's <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">impending crackdown on loading APKs</a>.</p>
<p>Now, after doing all that work, guess what I realized? <code>hasDevToggle</code> field in the Features class? Well the debug build has a feature toggles section:<br>
<img src="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/content/images/2025/09/1000002458.png" alt="1000002458.png" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>So for now you do not need to modify the project's code. You can get by with just using the debug build and toggling the feature off. Feature flags only exist for testing features though. Eventually the flag will go away and I'll have to disable the ads more directly.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="why-did-we-end-up-here">Why did we end up here?</h3>
<p>Pocket Casts, your current approach to monetization seems extreme. Are you in a similar situation to 2020? Back then the NPR <a href="https://media.npr.org/documents/about/statements/fy2020/National%20Public%20Radio%20-%20Consolidated%20Financial%20Statements%202020.pdf?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">financial report</a> only had a single line item of $812,129 for "Minus: Share of Podcast Media’s net loss". Why does a podcast service cost so much to run? If you give us more transparency, maybe we will better understand why you need to make changes.</p>
<p>Maybe more of the work can be moved on-device. You open-sourced your app. Maybe the community can help you out and contribute those changes? We're not too scary. You extended an olive branch by open-sourcing the project, so let's work together. Hopefully Automattic doesn't pull back on contributions like they <a href="https://automattic.com/2025/01/09/aligning-automattics-sponsored-contributions-to-wordpress/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">did with WordPress this year</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="an-entirely-different-option">An entirely different option</h3>
<p>As I mentioned in my post about <a href="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/the-apps-that-i-kept-on-grapheneos-2/#the-media-apps">the apps I kept when switching to GrapheneOS</a>,  self-hosting PinePods and using AntennaPod on your phone is a great option! That way you can still have web and desktop sync. I also said in that post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I wasn't grandfathered into the free premium tier I would be more tempted to jump ship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The time to jump ship seems to be getting closer. I think Pocket Casts will join a future version of my <a href="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/the-apps-that-i-got-rid-of-when-trying-out-grapheneos/">apps that I got rid of when switching to GrapheneOS</a> post.</p>
<p>Oh, and if anyone is looking for new podcasts to listen to, <a href="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/what-podcasts-am-i-listening-to-2025/">I have recommendations</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="more-info-4">
          <p>If you've ever traveled in search of fall foliage before, you likely know how tricky it can be to be in the right place at the right time. The timing of peak color varies signficantly season-to-season, meaning what worked one year might not work the next! The best fall trips take careful planning, a lot of patience, and a reliable fall foliage map.</p>
          <p>It's helpful to establish a baseline for when leaves <i>normally</i> change. Maps, like the one in the above section, can help you identify roughly when in the season you should be planning your trip. From there, you should consult a real-time fall foliage map like ours to see if fall foliage is on-time or running early/late due to ongoing weather conditions.</p>
          <p>If at all possible, don't solidify your plans until you're two weeks out from peak fall foliage. This allows you to be flexible should extreme weather rear its head and disrupt the normal progression of fall foliage. Should that not be an option for you, do your planning in early September when fall foliage experts can give you an idea of whether or not fall color is on-time this year.</p>
          <p>You'll want to make the most of your time in fall's splendor, so be sure to pick out a few beautiful hikes or drives on which you can truly be emersed in autumnal glory. If you're looking to beat the crowds, consider going to popular locations very early in the morning, before the majority of people arrive. Sunrise bathes fall foliage in golden hues, making early morning one of the best times to venture out!</p>

<p><span>Section</span> <span>1</span>. &nbsp;<span>Antifa as a Terrorist Threat</span>.&nbsp; Antifa is a militarist, anarchist enterprise that explicitly calls for the overthrow of the United States Government, law enforcement authorities, and our system of law.&nbsp; It uses illegal means to organize and execute a campaign of violence and terrorism nationwide to accomplish these goals.&nbsp; This campaign involves coordinated efforts to obstruct enforcement of Federal laws through armed standoffs with law enforcement, organized riots, violent assaults on Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other law enforcement officers, and routine doxing of and other threats against political figures and activists. &nbsp;Antifa recruits, trains, and radicalizes young Americans to engage in this violence and suppression of political activity, then employs elaborate means and mechanisms to shield the identities of its operatives, conceal its funding sources and operations in an effort to frustrate law enforcement, and recruit additional members.&nbsp; Individuals associated with and acting on behalf of Antifa further coordinate with other organizations and entities for the purpose of spreading, fomenting, and advancing political violence and suppressing lawful political speech.&nbsp; This organized effort designed to achieve policy objectives by coercion and intimidation is domestic terrorism.</p>



<p><span>Sec</span>. <span>2</span>. &nbsp;<span>Designation as a Domestic Terrorist Organization</span>.&nbsp; Because of the aforementioned pattern of political violence designed to suppress lawful political activity and obstruct the rule of law, I hereby designate Antifa as a “domestic terrorist organization.”&nbsp; All relevant executive departments and agencies shall utilize all applicable authorities to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle any and all illegal operations — especially those involving terrorist actions — conducted by Antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa, or for which Antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa provided material support, including necessary investigatory and prosecutorial actions against those who fund such operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span>Sec</span>. <span>3</span>. &nbsp;<span>General Provisions</span>.&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law.&nbsp; This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>



<p>(b)&nbsp; This order shall be published in the <em>Federal Register.</em></p>

                                        <p>People who are incarcerated are paid notoriously low wages for kitchen, laundry work and maintenance.</p><p>But the expanded use of laptops is creating other opportunities.</p>
<p><i>This is part two in a two-part series about remote work in Maine prisons. </i><a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/maine/2025-08-28/cracking-the-code-how-technology-and-education-are-changing-life-in-prison" target="_blank"><i>To read part one, click here</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>Preston Thorpe is only 32, but he says he's already landed his dream job as a senior software engineer and bought a modest house with his six-figure salary. It was all accomplished by putting in long days from his cell at the Mountain View Correctional Center in Charleston.</p><p>"It's not normal to have 15-17 hours a day to really focus on something and learn something, like deeply," Thorpe says. "And fortunately tech is one of the few areas where they're not concerned with your college degree. They're really only concerned with your ability to write code."</p>
<p>A self-described "computer geek," Thorpe says he built his first computer at age 13. In high school he always expected he'd have a career in tech. But he also had a rebellious side. He got into trouble with drugs, using them and selling them. He says his parents kicked him out of the house and he ended up in prison for the first time at age 20.</p><p>"You know, I was worried and pretty hopeless that I had messed my life up so bad that it was no longer possible to have like a normal life and normal career," he says.</p><p>When you have nothing to lose, Thorpe says it's pretty easy to behave that way. And when you're out of prison with a criminal record, no money and an identity as a convict, he says the likelihood you're going to improve your life in any way is zero.</p><p>His own circumstances changed in 2019 when he got transferred from the New Hampshire prison system to Maine, where he discovered laptops with limited internet access were available for education. That's when he says he had an epiphany that he could change himself by pursuing his passion. And about two years ago, he became one of the first incarcerated people in the country to get hired for a remote job.</p><p>"Now I feel like my life has purpose," Thorpe says.</p><div data-align-center="">

<p>Glauber Costa says he first became aware of Thorpe through his contributions to an online public software project. Costa is the CEO of Turso, an international database company. He was impressed by Thorpe's work and had no idea he was incarcerated.</p><p>Once he found out, he thought it would be impossible to talk to Thorpe, let alone hire him.</p><p>"But then," Costa says, "it turns out that he can take video calls. And then by talking to him, it became very, very clear to me that if this is not a reformed person I don't know what is."</p><p>Costa says he was also surprised to learn that Thorpe was eligible for remote work while he was in prison. He hired him in June. He figured Thorpe might have trouble clearing the company's background check and he says he prepared himself for that. But since it only searches back seven years and since Thorpe has been in prison for more than a decade, "He is actually our cleanest background check," Costa says.</p><p>"He doesn't have a parking ticket."</p><p>Several dozen other prisoners are also working remote jobs. At the Maine Correctional Center in Windham, Darlene George is a certified recovery coach, a scholar and a teaching assistant who's serving a 40-year sentence for the murder of her husband.</p><div data-align-center="">

<p>"I became incarcerated in 2009 and I've been here 16 years," George says.</p><p>Unlike most women in prison, George had a college degree before she was incarcerated. She says she still tries to make the most of every opportunity she can. For the past two years, she's held a full-time remote job, first as a grant writer and now as a program coordinator, for a Maine-based health care company.</p><p>"The work, it just, it really makes you feel good," she says. "When I — when I put my head down at night I can say I'm giving something back."</p><p>George relishes her role as a decision maker and an advocate for clients' health care. She makes a competitive salary. And she says her boss and her co-workers are extremely supportive of her situation, and so are the other women at the Maine Correctional Center.</p><p>"Literally, I work from my room. There's a sign that I put out that lets people know I'm Zooming or in meetings," she says. "They try not to be noisy on the floor ... because they're like, 'Well, we want a job, too.'"</p><div data-align-center="">

<p>Mara Sanchez, the program director for the Alliance for Higher Education in Prison, says Maine's Department of Corrections was the first to have a remote work policy.</p><p>"Their implementation, willingness to try remote work for incarcerated students has really kind of set the bar for other states and been very inspiring to other states," she says.</p><p>Maine Corrections Commissioner Randall Liberty says remote work is an outgrowth of expanded educational opportunities in prison. There are 800 residents who now have access to the internet.</p><p>"We have technicians that are watching where they're going and what they're doing and we've had very few problems," Liberty says. "If it provides meaningful employment for them ... it also allows for a transition back into the community."</p><p>For example, Liberty says one resident worked as a paralegal for a law firm and continued with the job after he got out. Wages are garnished for child support, victim restitution and other fees. And for those who earn above a certain amount, 10% goes to the Department of Corrections for room and board. But residents can also save money or send it home. And Liberty says between educational programs and remote work, the prison environment is better for everyone.</p><div data-align-center="">

<p>"It's important that the officers work with residents that have hope and have meaning in their life," he says. "We had 87 assaults on staff in 2017. Last year, we had seven assaults on staff. So all of this work isn't just about the residents. It's about the community ... the officers that go to work everyday and don't feel like their life is at risk."</p><p>Liberty is optimistic that remote work can be expanded to other people in prison as the network of employers who understand their value grows.</p><p>"I think it can become the norm," he says. "This isn't a reckless attempt at finding work for individuals. This is a well-thought out plan with lessons learned and consequences. ... The last thing anybody wants is to lose their laptop."</p><p>Preston Thorpe would agree. He's hoping to be released sometime next year.

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled Monday that a nearly complete offshore wind project halted by the administration can resume, dealing President Donald Trump a setback in his ongoing effort to restrict the fledgling industry.</p><p>Work on the nearly completed Revolution Wind project for Rhode Island and Connecticut <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/offshore-revolution-wind-project-stopped-trump-33214b9efb8f3f7a98c58299581bff9f">has been paused since Aug. 22</a></span> when the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop-work order for what it said were national security concerns. The Interior Department agency did not specify those concerns at the time. Both the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-renewable-energy-offshore-wind-revolution-wind-356d6be1f0967302cd8414b2fb881308">developer and the two states sued</a></span> in federal courts.</p><p>Danish energy company Orsted and its joint venture partner Skyborn Renewables sought a preliminary injunction in U.S. District Court that would allow them to move forward with the project.</p><p>At a hearing Monday, Judge Royce Lamberth said he considered how Revolution Wind has relied on its federal approval, the delays are costing $2.3 million a day and if the project can’t meet deadlines, the entire enterprise could collapse. After December, the specialized ship needed to complete the project won’t be available until at least 2028, he said. More than 1,000 people have been working on the wind farm, which is 80% complete.</p>
    
<p>“There is no question in my mind of irreparable harm to the plaintiffs,” Lamberth said, as he granted the motion for the preliminary injunction. In his written ruling, he said Revolution Wind had “demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits” of its claim, adding that granting the injunction is in the public interest.</p>



<p>Interior Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Peace said the ruling means Revolution Wind “will be able to resume construction” while the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management “continues its investigation into possible impacts by the project to national security and prevention of other uses on the Outer Continental Shelf.”</p>
    
    
    
<p>The administration said in a court filing this month that while BOEM approved the wind farm, it stipulated that the developer continue to work with the Department of Defense to mitigate national security concerns. It said the Interior Department, to date, has not received any information that these concerns have been addressed.</p>
    
<p>Orsted said Monday that construction will resume as soon as possible, and it will continue to seek to work collaboratively with the administration.</p><p>Nancy Pyne of the Sierra Club said the court ruling “reaffirms that Donald Trump and his administration’s attacks on clean energy are not only reckless and harmful to our communities, but they are also illegal.” Trump is trying to “kneecap” renewable energy “in favor of dirty and expensive fossil fuels,” she said. </p><p>White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Trump was elected with a mandate to “restore our country’s energy dominance — which includes prioritizing the most effective and reliable tools to power our country. This will not be the final say on the matter.” </p><p>On the campaign trail, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-offshore-wind-energy-4e5b18ecd4799cc4cfd8cd7dc7b326ee">Trump vowed to end the offshore wind industry</a></span> as soon as he returned to the White House. He wants to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which emit greenhouse gases that cause climate change, in order for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity of any nation in the world, he says.</p>
    
<p>His administration has <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/offshore-revolution-wind-project-stopped-trump-33214b9efb8f3f7a98c58299581bff9f">stopped construction on major offshore wind farms</a></span>, revoked wind energy permits and <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/wind-energy-offshore-turbines-trump-executive-order-995a744c3c1a2eddb30cacf50b681f13">paused permitting</a></span>, canceled plans to use <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-wind-permitting-offshore-7a05dff77ba92e4a7761604583a6d208">large areas of federal waters</a></span> for new offshore wind development and stopped <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-offshore-wind-renewable-energy-transportation-8578da8b985b6d4eef20ec4d85c21b5d">$679 million in federal funding</a></span> for a dozen offshore wind projects. </p><p>Last week, the administration moved to block a <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-offshore-wind-southcoast-massachusetts-125266070fcc8c784c92ca83d6f14300">separate Massachusetts offshore wind farm</a></span>. That was just days after the Interior Department asked a federal judge in Baltimore to cancel previous approval to build an offshore wind project in Maryland. </p><p>Revolution Wind is supposed to be Rhode Island’s and Connecticut’s first large offshore wind farm, capable of supplying power to more than 350,000 homes, about 2.5% of the region’s electricity needs.</p><p>Connecticut Attorney General William Tong and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, who are both Democrats, called the judge’s ruling a major win for workers and families, who need the project to stay on track so it can start to drive down unaffordable energy bills. </p>
    
<p>Connecticut Rep. Joe Courtney, a Democrat, said a multibillion-dollar project that is 80% complete and was fully permitted with input by the Pentagon is not a national security problem. The Interior Department “should take the hint and let the thousands of construction workers finish the job,” he said.</p><p>Orsted began construction in 2024 about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the Rhode Island coast. It says in its complaint that about $5 billion has been spent or committed, and it expects more than $1 billion in costs if the project is canceled. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI co-scientists.

<h2>Station owners can still block Kimmel show</h2>
<p>Apparently buoyed by Disney caving to his demand to "take action" against Kimmel, Carr went on to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/after-getting-jimmy-kimmel-suspended-fcc-chair-threatens-abcs-the-view/">make threats</a> regarding ABC's <em>The View</em> and NBC late-night hosts Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon. Carr's threats were criticized by Democratic lawmakers en masse, and a couple of prominent Republicans <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/rand-paul-fcc-chair-had-no-business-intervening-in-abc-kimmel-controversy/">sided against him</a>. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said that "Brendan Carr has got no business weighing in on this," while Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said that Carr's threat to ABC was "right outta <em>Goodfellas</em>."</p>
<p>Disney reinstating Kimmel doesn't necessarily mean his show will immediately appear on all ABC-affiliated networks. Conservative broadcaster Sinclair <a href="https://sbgi.net/sinclair-says-kimmel-suspension-is-not-enough-calls-on-fcc-and-abc-to-take-additional-action/">said last week</a> that "regardless of ABC's plans for the future of the program, Sinclair intends not to return <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> to our air until we are confident that appropriate steps have been taken to uphold the standards expected of a national broadcast platform."</p>
<p>Station owner Nexstar helped pressure Disney into suspending Kimmel's show last week when it <a href="https://www.nexstar.tv/nexstar-abc-affiliates-to-preempt-jimmy-kimmel-live-indefinitely-beginning-tonight/">announced</a> its ABC-affiliated stations would not air the show "for the foreseeable future."</p>
<p>Part of Carr's strategy was to urge station owners to demand that Kimmel be taken off the air. "The individual licensed stations that are taking their content, it's time for them to step up and say this garbage isn't something that we think serves the needs of our local communities," Carr said.</p>
<p>The pressure from broadcasters came at a time when both <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/broadcaster-fcc-abolish-national-tv-ownership-rule-1236496159/">Nexstar</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/doj-probes-disney-fubo-deal-over-competition-concerns">Disney</a> are seeking Trump administration approval for mergers. Anna Gomez, the one Democrat on the Republican-majority FCC, said that companies seeking merger approvals are "vulnerable to pressure to bend to the government's ideological demands."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>Celebrated Italian author and scholar <a href="http://amzn.to/2loibAd">Umberto Eco</a> (1932-2016)&nbsp; published an article in 1995 entitled <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/">Ur-Fascism</a> .</p>
<p>Eco grew up during the time of Mussolini. In the article, he jumps from memories of that experience to describe some varieties of fascism and other types of totalitarianism. Not all are well-defined fascism, he says, but he does identify the core characteristics of what he calls Ur-Fascism.</p>
<p>I think it is possible to outline a list of features that are typical of what I would like to call Ur-Fascism, or Eternal Fascism. These features cannot be organized into a system; many of them contradict each other, and are also typical of other kinds of despotism or fanaticism. But it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it.</p>
<p>Eco goes on to list 14 features of Ur-Fascism. This is the excerpted list; please read the article for an expanded explanation. And as you read it, please consider which of those features you might be seeing now.</p>
<p>1. The first feature of Ur-Fascism is the cult of tradition….As a consequence, there can be no advancement of learning.</p>
<p>2. Traditionalism implies the rejection of modernism….In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.</p>
<p>3. Irrationalism also depends on the cult of action for action’s sake. Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection.</p>
<p>4. No syncretistic faith can withstand analytical criticism. The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism.</p>
<p>5. Besides, disagreement is a sign of diversity. Ur-Fascism grows up and seeks for consensus by exploiting and exacerbating the natural fear of difference.</p>
<p>6. Ur-Fascism derives from individual or social frustration. That is why one of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.</p>
<p>7. To people who feel deprived of a clear social identity, Ur-Fascism says that their only privilege is the most common one, to be born in the same country. This is the origin of nationalism.</p>
<p>8. The followers must feel humiliated by the ostentatious wealth and force of their enemies….Thus, by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.</p>
<p>9. For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.</p>
<p>10. Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology, insofar as it is fundamentally aristocratic, and aristocratic and militaristic elitism cruelly implies contempt for the weak. Ur-Fascism can only advocate a popular elitism.</p>
<p>11. In such a perspective everybody is educated to become a hero. In every mythology the hero is an exceptional being, but in Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm.</p>
<p>12. Since both permanent war and heroism are difficult games to play, the Ur-Fascist transfers his will to power to sexual matters. This is the origin of machismo (which implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality). Since even sex is a difficult game to play, the Ur-Fascist hero tends to play with weapons—doing so becomes an ersatz phallic exercise.</p>
<p>13. Ur-Fascism is based upon a selective populism, a qualitative populism, one might say. In a democracy, the citizens have individual rights, but the citizens in their entirety have a political impact only from a quantitative point of view—one follows the decisions of the majority. For Ur-Fascism, however, individuals as individuals have no rights, and the People is conceived as a quality, a monolithic entity expressing the Common Will. Since no large quantity of human beings can have a common will, the Leader pretends to be their interpreter….Because of its qualitative populism Ur-Fascism must be against “rotten” parliamentary governments.</p>
<p>14. Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak.</p>
<p>Eco closes with this:</p>
<p>Ur-Fascism is still around us, sometimes in plainclothes. It would be so much easier, for us, if there appeared on the world scene somebody saying, “I want to reopen Auschwitz, I want the Black Shirts to parade again in the Italian squares.” Life is not that simple. Ur-Fascism can come back under the most innocent of disguises. Our duty is to uncover it and to point our finger at any of its new instances—every day, in every part of the world.</p>

<p>Democratic lawmakers have criticized Carr en masse, saying he abused his power in order to censor speech. Not many Republican lawmakers have done so, but Carr did take heat from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee that has oversight over the FCC.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6KYixCBTJc">his podcast</a> Friday, Cruz discussed the Carr comment in which the FCC chair said of ABC, "We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead."</p>
<p>"[Carr] says, 'We can do this the easy way or we can do this the hard way.' And I gotta say, that's right outta <em>Goodfellas</em>, that's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar going, 'Nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it,'" Cruz said.</p>

<h2>Cruz: Resist urge to censor opponents</h2>
<p>Cruz said he is "thrilled" that Kimmel was suspended, noting that "Jimmy Kimmel has mocked me so many times I cannot count." But Cruz said that using the government to dictate what the media can say "will end up bad for conservatives," and that what Carr said is "dangerous as hell." In a J.R.R. Tolkien reference, Cruz compared the power of government to the power and allure of Sauron's One Ring.</p>
<p>"It reminds me of like the Ring of Power," Cruz said. "It is so attractive, it is sort of like conservatives saying, 'Wait, if we have government, we have power. We can ban the media.' Let me tell you what will happen. Going down this road, there will come a time when a Democrat wins again, wins the White House. They will silence us, they will use this power, and they will use it ruthlessly."</p>
<p>The Kimmel controversy is over a monologue in which he said, "We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and with everything they can to score political points from it."</p>

<blockquote><p>These books were the gateway drugs of interactive entertainment.</p>
<p>— Choose Your Own Adventure historian Christian Swineheart</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My first experience with interactive media wasn’t mediated by any sort of digital technology. Instead it came courtesy of a “technology” that was already more than half a millennium old at the time: the printed book.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1980, I was eight years old, and doing my childish best to adjust to life in a suburb of Dallas, Texas, where my family had moved the previous summer from the vicinity of Youngstown, Ohio. I was a skinny, frail kid who wasn’t very good at throwing balls or throwing punches, which did nothing to ease the transition. Even when I wasn’t being actively picked on, I was bewildered at my new classmates’ turns of phrase (“I reckon,” “y’all,” “I’m fixin’ to”) that I had previously heard only in the John Wayne movies I watched on my dad’s knee. In their eyes, my birthplace north of the Mason Dixon Line meant that I could be dismissed as just another clueless, borderline useless “Yankee,” a heathen in the eyes of those who adhered to my new state’s twin religions of Baptist Christianity and Friday-night football.</p>
<p>I found my refuge in my imagination. I was interested in just about everything — a trait I’ve never lost, both to my benefit and my detriment in life — and I could sit for long periods of time in my room, spinning out fantasies in my head about school lessons, about books I’d read, about television shows I’d seen, even about songs I’d heard on the radio. I actually framed this as a distinct activity in my mind: “I’m going to go imagine now.” If nothing else, it was good training for becoming a writer. As they say, the child is the father of the man.</p>
<p>One Friday afternoon, I discovered a slim, well-thumbed volume in my elementary school’s scanty library. Above the title <a href="https://gamebooks.org/Item/518/Show"><em>The Cave of Time</em></a> was the now-iconic&nbsp;<em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> masthead, proclaiming it to be the first book in a series. Curious as always, I opened it to the first page. I was precocious enough to know what was meant by a first-person and third-person narrator of written fiction, but this was something else: this book was written in the <em>second</em> person.</p>
<blockquote><p>You’ve hiked through Snake Canyon once before while visiting your Uncle Howard at Red Creek Ranch, but you never noticed any cave entrance. It looks as though a recent rock slide has uncovered it.</p>
<p>Though the late afternoon sun is striking the surface of the cave, the interior remains in total darkness. You step inside a few feet, trying to get an idea of how big it is. As your eyes become used to the dark, you see what looks like a tunnel ahead, dimly lit by some kind of phosphorescent material on its walls. The tunnel walls are smooth, as if they were shaped by running water. After twenty feet or so, the tunnel curves. You wonder where it leads. You venture in a bit further, but you feel nervous being alone in such a strange place. You turn and hurry out.</p>
<p>A thunderstorm may be coming, judging by how dark it looks outside. Suddenly you realize the sun has long since set, and the landscape is lit only by the pale light of the full moon. You must have fallen asleep and woken up hours later. But then you remember something even more strange. Just last evening, the moon was only a slim crescent in the sky.</p>
<p>You wonder how long you’ve been in the cave. You are not hungry. You don’t feel you have been sleeping. You wonder whether to try to walk back home by moonlight or whether to wait for dawn, rather than risk your footing on the steep and rocky trail.</p></blockquote>
<p>All of this was intriguing enough already for a kid like me, but now came the kicker. The book asked me — asked <em>me</em>!! — whether I wanted to “start back home” (“turn to page 4”) or to “wait” (“turn to page 5”). This was the book I had never known I needed, a vehicle for the imagination like no other.</p>
<p>I took&nbsp;<em>The Cave of Time</em> home and devoured it that weekend. Through the simple expedient of flipping through its pages, I time-traveled to the age of dinosaurs, to the Battle of Gettysburg, to London during the Blitz, to the building of <a href="https://analog-antiquarian.net/2021/12/17/introduction-walls-walls-and-yet-again-walls/">the Great Wall of China</a>, to <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2022/09/titanic-visions-part-1-sifting-through-the-wreckage">the <em>Titanic</em></a> and the Ice Age and <a href="https://analog-antiquarian.net/2023/03/30/chapter-1-a-dawning-age-of-faith/">the Middle Ages</a>. Much of this history was entirely new to me, igniting whole new avenues of interest. Today, it’s all too easy to see all of the limitations and infelicities of <em>The Cave of Time</em> and its successors: a book of 115 pages that had, as it proudly trumpeted on the cover, 40 possible endings meant that the sum total of any given adventure wasn’t likely to span more than about three choices if you were lucky. But to a lonely, hyper-imaginative eight-year-old, none of that mattered. I was well and truly smitten, not so much by what the book was as by what I wished it to be, by what I was able to turn it into in my mind by the sheer intensity of that wish.</p>
<p>I remained a devoted&nbsp;<em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> reader for the next couple of years. Back in those days, each book could be had for just $1.25, well within reach of a young boy’s allowance even at a time when a dollar was worth a lot more than it is today. Each volume had some archetypal-feeling adventurous theme that made it catnip for a kid who was also discovering Jules Verne and beginning to flirt with golden-age science fiction (the golden age being, of course, age twelve): <a href="https://gamebooks.org/Item/163/Show">deep-sea diving</a>, <a href="https://gamebooks.org/Item/563/Show">a journey by hot-air balloon</a>, <a href="https://gamebooks.org/Item/333/Show">the Wild West</a>, <a href="https://gamebooks.org/Item/552/Show">a cross-country auto race</a>, <a href="https://gamebooks.org/Item/551/Show">the Egyptian pyramids</a>, <a href="https://gamebooks.org/Item/553/Show">a hunt for the Abominable Snowman</a>. What they evoked in me was as important as what was actually printed on the page; each was a springboard for another weekend of fantasizing about exotic undertakings where nobody mocked you because you had two left feet in gym class and spoke with a stubbornly persistent Northern accent. And each was a springboard for learning as well; this process usually started with pestering my parents, and then, if I didn’t get everything I needed from that source, ended with me turning to the family set of <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em> in the study. (I remember how when reading <em>Journey Under the Sea</em> I was confused by frequent references to “the bends.” I asked my mom what that meant, and, bless her heart, she said she thought the bends were diarrhea. Needless to say, this put a whole new spin on my underwater exploits until I finally did a bit of my own research about diving.)</p>
<p>Inevitably, I did begin to see the limitations of the format in time — right about the time that some of my nerdier classmates, whom I had by now managed to connect with, started to show me a tabletop game called <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/07/dungeons-and-dragons"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.&nbsp;<em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> had primed me to understand and respond to it right away; it would be no exaggeration to say that I saw this game that would remake so much of the entertainment landscape in its image as simply a <em>better</em>, less constrained take on the same core concept. Ditto the computer games that I began to notice in a corner of the bookstore I haunted circa 1984. When <a href="https://www.filfre.net/tag/infocom/?order=asc">Infocom</a> promised me that playing one of their games meant “waking up inside a story,” I knew exactly what they must mean: <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> done&nbsp;<em>right</em>. For the Christmas of 1984, I convinced my parents to buy me a disk drive for the <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2012/12/the-commodore-64">Commodore 64</a> they had bought me the year before. And so the die was cast. If <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> hadn’t come along, I don’t think that I would be the Digital Antiquarian today.</p>
<p>But since I am the Digital Antiquarian, I have my usual array of questions to ask. Where did <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em>, that gateway drug for the first generation to be raised on interactive media, come from? Who was responsible for it? The most obvious answer is the authors Edward Packard and R.A. Montgomery, one or the other of whose name could be seen on most of the early books in the series. But two authors alone do not a cultural phenomenon make.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Will you read me a story?”</p>
<p>“Read you a story? What fun would that be? I’ve got a better idea: let’s tell a story together.”</p>
<p>— Adam Cadre, <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/11/retro-no-more-interactive-fiction-of-the-early-comp-era">Photopia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the twentieth century, when print still ruled the roost, the hidden hands behind the American cultural zeitgeist were the agents, editors, and marketers in and around the big Manhattan publishing houses, who decided which books were worth publishing and promoting, who decided what they would look like and even to a large extent how they would read. No one outside of the insular world of print publishing knew these people’s names, but the power they had to shape hearts and minds was enormous — arguably more so than that of any of the writers they served. After all, even the most prolific author of fiction or non-fiction usually couldn’t turn out more than one book per year, whereas an agent or editor could quietly, anonymously leave her fingerprints on dozens. Amy Berkower, a name I’m pretty sure you’ve never heard of, is a fine case in point.</p>
<p>Berkower joined Writers House, one of the most prestigious of the New York literary agencies, during the mid-1970s as a “secretarial girl.” Having shown herself to be an enthusiastic go-getter by working long hours and sitting in on countless meetings, she was promoted to the role of agent in 1977, but assigned to “juvenile publishing,” largely because nobody else in the organization wanted to work with such non-prestigious books. Yet the assignment suited Berkower just fine. “As a kid, I read and loved Nancy Drew before I went on to Camus,” she says. “I was in the right place at the right time. I didn’t have the bias that juvenile series wouldn’t lead to Camus.”</p>
<p>Thus when a fellow named Ray Montgomery came to her with a unique concept he called&nbsp;<em>Adventures of You</em>, he found a receptive audience. Montgomery was the co-owner of a small press called Vermont Crossroads, far removed from the glitz and glamor of Manhattan. Crossroads’s typical fare was esoteric volumes like <em>Hemingway in Michigan</em> and&nbsp;<em>The Male Nude in Photography</em> that generally weren’t expected to break four digits in total unit sales. A few years earlier, however, Montgomery had himself been approached by Edward Packard, a lawyer by trade who had already pitched a multiple-choice children’s book called <em>Sugarcane Island</em> to what felt like every other publisher in the country without success.</p>
<p>As he would find himself relating again and again to curious journalists in the decades to come, Packard had come up with his idea for an interactive book by making a virtue of necessity. During the 1960s, he was an up-and-coming attorney who worked long days in Manhattan, to which he commuted by train from his and his wife’s home in Greenwich, Connecticut. He often arrived home in the evening just in time to put his two daughters to bed. They liked to be told a bedtime story, but Packard was usually so exhausted that he had trouble coming up with one. So, he slyly enlisted his daughters’ help with the creative process. He would feed them a little bit of a story in which <em>they</em> were the stars, then ask them what they wanted to do next. Their answers would jog his tired imagination, and he would be off and running once again.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, the girls would each want to do something different. “What would happen if you wrote both endings?” Packard mused to himself. A long-time frustrated writer as well as a self-described “lawyer who was never comfortable with the law,” Packard began to wonder whether he could turn his interactive bedtime stories into a new kind of book. By as early as 1969, he had invented the classic <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> format — turn to this page to do this, turn to that page to do that — and produced his first finished work in the style: the aforementioned <em>Sugarcane Island</em>, about a youngster who gets swept off the deck of a scientific research vessel by a sudden tidal wave and washed ashore on a mysterious Pacific island that has monsters, pirates, sharks, headhunters, and many another staple of more traditional children’s adventure fiction to contend with.</p>
<p>He was sure that it was “such a wonderful idea, I’d immediately find a big publisher.” He signed on with an agent, who “said he would be surprised if there were no takers,” recalls Packard. “Then he proceeded to be surprised.” One rejection letter stated that “it’s hard enough to get children to read, and you’re just making it harder with all these choices.” Letters like that came over and over again, over a period of years.</p>
<p>By 1975, Edward Packard was divorced from both his agent and his wife. With his daughters no longer of an age to beg for bedtime stories, he had just about resigned himself to being a lawyer forever. Then, whilst flipping through an issue of <em>Vermont Life</em> during a stay at a ski lodge, he happened upon a small advertisement from Crossroads Press. “Authors Wanted,” it read. Crossroads wasn’t the bright-lights, big-city publisher Packard had once dreamed of, but on a lark he sent a copy of <em>Sugarcane Island</em> to the address in the magazine.</p>
<p>It arrived on the desk of Ray Montgomery, who was instantly intrigued. “I Xeroxed 50 copies of Ed’s manuscript and took it to a reading teacher in Stowe,” Montgomery told <em>The New York Times</em> in 1981. “His kids — third grade through junior high — couldn’t get enough of it.” Satisfied by that proof of concept, Montgomery agreed to publish the book. Crossroads Press sold 8000 copies of&nbsp;<em>Sugarcane Island</em> over the next couple of years, a figure that was “unbelievable” by their modest standards. Montgomery was inspired to pen a book of his own in the same style, which he called&nbsp;<em>Journey Under the Sea</em>. The budding series was given the name&nbsp;<em>Adventures of You</em> — a proof that, whatever else they may have had going for them, branding was not really Crossroads Press’s strength.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2025/09/choose-your-own-adventure/sugarcane/" rel="attachment wp-att-6468"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sugarcane-203x300.jpg" alt="" width="304" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sugarcane-203x300.jpg 203w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sugarcane.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px"></a></p>
<p>Indeed, Montgomery himself was well able to see that he had stumbled over a concept that was too big for his little press. He sent the two extant books to Amy Berkower at Writers House and asked her what she thought. Having grown up on Nancy Drew, she was inclined to judge them less on their individual merits than on their prospects as a franchise in the making. A concept this new, she judged, had to have a strong brand of its own in order for children to get used to it. It would take her some time to find a publisher who agreed with her.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Edward Packard, heartened by the relative success of <em>Sugarcane Island</em>, was writing more interactive books. Although their names were destined to be indelibly linked in the annals of pop-culture history, Packard and Montgomery would never really be friends; they would always have a somewhat prickly, contentious relationship with one another. In an early signal of this, Packard chose not to publish more books through Crossroads. Instead he convinced the mid-list Philadelphia-based publisher J.B. Lippincott to take on <em>Deadwood City</em>, a Western, and&nbsp;<a href="https://gamebooks.org/Item/332/Show"><em>Third Planet from Altair</em></a>, a sci-fi tale. These served ironically to confirm Amy Berkower’s belief that there needed to be a concerted push behind the concept as a branded series; released with no fanfare whatsoever, neither sold all that well. Yet Lippincott did do Packard one brilliant service. Above the titles on the covers of the books, it placed the words “Choose your own adventures in the Wild West!” and “Choose your own adventures in outer space!” There was a brand in the offing in those phrases, even if Lippincott didn’t realize it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2025/09/choose-your-own-adventure/deadwoodpb/" rel="attachment wp-att-6469"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deadwoodpb-195x300.jpg" alt="" width="293" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deadwoodpb-195x300.jpg 195w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deadwoodpb-667x1024.jpg 667w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deadwoodpb-768x1180.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/deadwoodpb.jpg 778w" sizes="(max-width: 293px) 100vw, 293px"></a></p>
<p>For her part, Berkower was now more convinced than ever that this book-by-book approach was the wrong one. There needed to be <em>a lot</em> of these books, quickly, in order for them to take off properly. She made the rounds of the big publishing houses one more time. She finally found the ally she was looking for in Joëlle Delbourgo at Bantam Books. Delbourgo recalls getting “really excited” by the concept: “I said, ‘Amy, this is revolutionary.’ This is pre-computer, remember. The idea of interactive fiction, choosing an ending, was fresh and novel. It tapped into something very fundamental. I remember how I felt when I read the books, and how excited I got, the clarity I had about them.”</p>
<p>Seeing eye to eye on what needed to be done to cement the concept in the minds of the nation’s children, the two women drew up a contract under whose terms Bantam would publish an initial order of no fewer than six books in two slates of three. They would appear under a distinctive series trade dress, with each volume numbered to feed young readers’ collecting instinct. Barbara Marcus, Bantam’s marketing director for children’s books, needed only slightly modify the phrases deployed by J.B. Lippincott to create the perfect, pithy, and as-yet un-trademarked name for the series: <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em>.</p>
<p>Berkower was acting as the agent of Montgomery alone up to this point. There are conflicting reports as to how and why Packard was brought into the fold. The widow of Ray Montgomery, who died in 2014, told <em>The New Yorker</em> in 2022 that her husband’s innate sense of fair play, plus the need to provide a lot of books quickly, prompted him to voluntarily bring Packard on as an equal partner. Edward Packard told the same magazine that it was Bantam who insisted that he be included, possibly in order to head off potential legal problems in the future.</p>
<p>At any rate, the first three <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> paperbacks arrived in bookstores in July of 1979. They were <em>The Cave of Time</em>, a new effort by Packard, written with some assistance from his daughter Andrea, she for whom he had first begun to tell his interactive stories; Montgomery’s journeyman <em>Journey Under the Sea</em>; and&nbsp;<em>By Balloon to the Sahara</em>, which Packard and Montgomery had subcontracted out to Douglas Terman, normally an author of adult military thrillers. Faced with an advertising budget that was almost nonexistent, Barbara Marcus devised an unusual grass-roots marketing strategy: “We did absolutely nothing except give the books away. We gave thousands of books to our salesmen and told them to give five to each bookseller and tell him to give them to the first five kids into his shop.”</p>
<p>The series sold itself, just as Marcus had believed it would. As <em>The New York Times</em> would soon write with a mixture of bemusement and condescension, it proved “contagious as chickenpox.” By September of 1980, around the time that I first discovered <em>The Cave of Time</em>,&nbsp;<em>Publishers Weekly</em> could report that <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> had become a “bonanza” for Bantam, which had sold more than 1 million copies of the first six volumes, with Packard and Montgomery now contracted to provide many more. A year later, eleven books in all had come out and the total sold was 4 million, with the series accounting for eight of the 25 bestselling children’s books at B. Dalton’s, the nation’s largest bookstore chain. A year after that, 10 million copies had been sold. By decade’s end, the total domestic sales of <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> would reach 34 million copies, with possibly that many or more again having been sold internationally after being translated into dozens of languages. The series was approaching its hundredth numbered volume by that point. It was a few years past its commercial peak already, but would continue on for another decade, until 184 volumes in all had come out.</p>
<p>Edward Packard, who turned 50 in 1981, could finally call himself an author rather than a lawyer by trade — and an astonishingly successful author at that, if not one who was likely to be given any awards by the literary elite. He and Ray Montgomery alone wrote about half of the 184 <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> installments. Packard’s prose was consistently solid and evocative without ever feeling like he was writing down to his audience, as the extract from <em>The Cave of Time</em> near the beginning of this article will attest; not all authors of children’s books, then or now, would dare to use a word like “phosphorescent.” If Montgomery was generally a less skilled wordsmith than Packard, and one who displayed less interest in producing internally consistent story spaces — weaknesses that I could see even as a young boy — he does deserve a full measure of credit for the pains he took to get the series off the ground in the first place. Looking back on the long struggle to get his brainstorm into print, Packard liked to quote the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer: “Every original idea is first ridiculed, then vigorously attacked, and finally taken for granted.”</p>
<p>Although Packard at least was always careful to make his protagonists androgynous, it was no secret that <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> appealed primarily to boys — which was no bad thing on the whole, given that it was also no secret that reading in general was a harder sell with little boys than it was with little girls. Some educators and child psychologists kvetched about the violence that was undoubtedly one of the sources of the series’s appeal for boys — in just about all of the books, it was disarmingly easy to get yourself flamboyantly and creatively killed&nbsp; — but Packard was quick to counter that the mayhem was all very stylized, “exaggerated and melodramatic” rather than “harsh or nasty.” “Stupid” choices were presented to you all the time, he noted, but never “cruel” ones: “You as [the] reader never hurt anyone.”</p>

Bantam explained to a disgruntled Packard that it had many years of market research showing that, while little girls were willing to buy books that showed a hero of the opposite gender on the cover, little boys were not similarly open-minded.</p></div>
<p>One had to be a publishing insider to know that this “boys series” owed its enormous success as much to the packaging and promotional skills of three women — Amy Berkower, Joëlle Delbourgo, and Barbara Marcus — as it did to the literary talents of Packard and Montgomery. Berkower in particular became a superstar within the publishing world in the wake of <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em>. Incredibly, the latter became only her second most successful children’s franchise, after the girl-focused&nbsp;<em>Sweet Valley High</em>, which could boast of 54 million copies sold domestically by the end of the 1980s; meanwhile <em>The Baby-Sitters Club</em> was coming up fast behind <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em>, with 27 million copies sold. In short, her books were reaching millions upon millions of children every single month. Small wonder that she was made a full partner at Writers House in 1988; she was moving far more books each month than anyone else there.</p>
<p>Of course, any hit on the scale of&nbsp;<em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> is bound to be copied. And this hit most certainly was, prolifically and unashamedly. During the middle years of the 1980s, when the format was at its peak, interactive books had whole aisles dedicated to them in bookstores. <a href="https://gamebooks.org/Series/29/Show"><em>Which Way?</em></a>, <a href="https://gamebooks.org/Series/104/Show"><em>Decide Your Own Adventure</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://gamebooks.org/Series/304/Show"><em>Pick-a-Path</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://gamebooks.org/Series/1571/Show"><em>Twisted Tales</em></a>… branders did what they could when the best brand was already taken. While&nbsp;<em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> remained archetypal in its themes and settings, other lines were unabashedly idiosyncratic: anyone up for a&nbsp;<a href="https://gamebooks.org/Series/115/Show"><em>Do-It-Yourself Jewish Adventure</em></a>?&nbsp;Publishers were quick to leverage other properties for which they owned the rights, from <a href="https://gamebooks.org/Series/116/Show"><em>Doctor Who</em></a> to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://gamebooks.org/Series/270/Show">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>. TSR, the maker of that other school-cafeteria sensation&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, introduced <a href="https://gamebooks.org/Series/79/Show">an interactive-book line drawn from the game</a>; even this website’s old friend Infocom came out with <a href="https://gamebooks.org/Series/311/Show"><em>Zork</em> books</a>, written by the star computer-game implementor <a href="https://www.filfre.net/tag/meretzky/?order=asc">Steve Meretzky</a>. Many of these books were content with the <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> approach of nothing but chunks of text tied to arbitrarily branching choices, but others grafted rules systems onto the format to effectively become solo role-playing games packaged as paperback books, with character creation and advancement, a dice-driven combat system, etc. The most successful of these lines was <a href="https://gamebooks.org/Series/11/Show"><em>Fighting Fantasy</em></a>, a name that is today almost as well-remembered as <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> itself in some quarters.</p>

<p>The gamebook boom was big and real, but relatively short-lived. By 1987, the decline had begun, for both <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> and all of the copycats and expansions upon its formula that it had spawned. Although a few of the most lucrative series, like <em>Fighting Fantasy</em>, would join the ur-property of the genre in surviving well into the 1990s, the majority were already starting to shrivel and fall away like apples in November. Demian Katz, the Internet’s foremost archivist of gamebooks, notes that this pattern has tended to hold true “in every country” where they make an appearance: “A few come out, they become explosively popular, a flood of knock-offs are released, they reach critical mass and then drop off into nothing.” It isn’t hard to spot the reason why in the context of 1980s North America. Computers were becoming steadily more commonplace — computers that were capable of bringing vastly more flexible forms of interactive storytelling to American children, via games that didn’t require one to read the same passages of text over and over again or to toss dice and keep track of a list of statistics on paper. The same pattern would be repeated elsewhere, such as in the former Soviet countries, most of which experienced their own gamebook boom and bust during the 1990s. It seems that the arrival of the commercial mass-market publishing infrastructure that makes gamebooks go is generally followed in short order by the arrival of affordable digital technology for the home, which stops them cold.</p>
<p>In the United States, Bantam Books tried throughout the 1990s to make <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> feel relevant to the children of that decade, introducing a more photo-realistic art style to accompany edgier, more traditionally novelistic plots. None of it worked. In 1999, after a good twelve years of slowly but steadily declining sales, Bantam finally pulled the plug on the series. <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> became just another nostalgic relic of the day-glo decade, to be placed on the shelf next to Michael Jackson’s <em>Thriller</em>, a Jane Fonda workout video, and that old&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Basic Set.</p>
<div id="attachment_6474"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2025/09/choose-your-own-adventure/cyoa184/" rel="attachment wp-att-6474"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6474" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyoa184-208x300.jpg" alt="" width="312" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyoa184-208x300.jpg 208w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyoa184-710x1024.jpg 710w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyoa184-768x1107.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cyoa184.jpg 788w" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-6474">Appropriately enough, the very last <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> book was written by Edward&nbsp; and Andrea Packard, the latter being the grown-up version of one of the little girls to whom he had once told interactive bedtime stories.</p></div>
<p>As of this writing, <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> is still around in a way, but the only real <em>raison d’être</em> it has left is nostalgia. In 2003, Ray Montgomery saw that Bantam Books had let the trademark for the series lapse, and formed his own company called Chooseco to try to revive it, mostly by republishing the old books that he had written himself. He met with mixed results at best. Since Montgomery’s death in 2014, Chooseco has continued to be operated by his family, who have used it increasingly as an instrument of litigation. In 2020, for example, Netflix agreed to settle for an undisclosed sum a lawsuit over <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9495224">“Bandersnatch,”</a> a bold interactive episode of the critically lauded streaming series <em>Black Mirror</em> whose script unwisely mentioned the book series from which it drew inspiration.</p>
<p>A worthier successor on the whole is <a href="https://www.choiceofgames.com/">Choice Of Games</a>, a name whose similarity to <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> can hardly be coincidental. Born out of a revival of the old menu-driven computer game <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2014/11/alter-ego"><em>Alter Ego</em></a>, Choice Of has released dozens of digital branching stories over the past fifteen years. In being more adventurous than literary and basing themselves around broad, archetypal ideas — <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=y6act0sdadab6l1n"><em>Choice of the Dragon</em></a>, <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=zl55orcu76ngwf6t"><em>Choice of Broadsides</em></a>, <a href="https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=66z6d3qdh378cti8"><em>Choice of the Vampire</em></a> — these games, which can run on just about any digital device capable of putting words on a screen, have done a fine job of carrying the spirit of <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> forward into this century. That said, there is one noteworthy difference: they are aimed at post-pubescent teens and adults — perhaps ones with fond memories of <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> — instead of children. “Play as male, female, or nonbinary; cis or trans; gay, straight, or bisexual; asexual and/or aromantic; allosexual and/or alloromantic; monogamous or polyamorous!” (Boring middle-aged married guy that I am, I must confess that I have no idea what three of those words even mean.)</p>
<p>Edward Packard, the father of it all, is still with us at age 94, still <a href="https://edwardpackard.com/personal-blog/">blogging</a> from time to time, still a little bemused at how he became one of the most successful working authors in the United States during the 1980s. In a plot twist almost as improbable as some of his stranger <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> endings, his grandson is David Corenswet, the latest actor to play Superman on the silver screen. Never a computer gamer, Packard would doubtless be baffled by most of what is featured on this website. And yet I owe him an immense debt of gratitude, for giving me my first glimpse of the potential of interactive storytelling, thus igniting a lifelong obsession. I suspect that more than one of you out there might be able to say the same.</p>

</p><p dir="auto">Qwen3-Omni is the natively end-to-end multilingual omni-modal foundation models. It processes text, images, audio, and video, and delivers real-time streaming responses in both text and natural speech. We introduce several architectural upgrades to improve performance and efficiency. Key features:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>State-of-the-art across modalities</strong>: Early text-first pretraining and mixed multimodal training provide native multimodal support. While achieving strong audio and audio-video results, unimodal text and image performance does not regress. Reaches SOTA on 22 of 36 audio/video benchmarks and open-source SOTA on 32 of 36; ASR, audio understanding, and voice conversation performance is comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Multilingual</strong>: Supports 119 text languages, 19 speech input languages, and 10 speech output languages.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Speech Input</strong>: English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, German, Russian, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Malay, Dutch, Indonesian, Turkish, Vietnamese, Cantonese, Arabic, Urdu.</li>
<li><strong>Speech Output</strong>: English, Chinese, French, German, Russian, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Novel Architecture</strong>: MoE-based Thinker–Talker design with AuT pretraining for strong general representations, plus a multi-codebook design that drives latency to a minimum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Real-time Audio/Video Interaction</strong>: Low-latency streaming with natural turn-taking and immediate text or speech responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Flexible Control</strong>: Customize behavior via system prompts for fine-grained control and easy adaptation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Detailed Audio Captioner</strong>: Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner is now open source: a general-purpose, highly detailed, low-hallucination audio captioning model that fills a critical gap in the open-source community.</p>
</li>

<p dir="auto">Here, we provide several methods to quickly get started with Qwen3-Omni. If you want complete experience of Qwen3-Omni, you can use <a href="#transformers-usage">Hugging Face Transformers</a>. However, since Qwen3-Omni employs an MoE architecture, inference speed with Hugging Face Transformers on MoE models can be very slow. For large-scale invocation or low-latency requirements, we highly recommend using <a href="#vllm-usage">vLLM</a> or performing inference via the <a href="#dashscope-api-usage">DashScope API</a>. We also strongly suggest using our provided <a href="#-docker">Docker</a> image, which includes a complete runtime environment for both Hugging Face Transformers and vLLM. In addition, our <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-Omni/tree/main/cookbooks">cookbooks</a> offer some use cases to show Qwen3-Omni's capabilities. Welcome to learn more!</p>

<p dir="auto">The Hugging Face Transformers code for Qwen3-Omni has been successfully merged, but the PyPI package has not yet been released. Therefore, you need to install it from source using the following command. We strongly recommend that you <strong>create a new Python environment</strong> or use our <a href="#-docker">Docker</a> to avoid environment runtime issues.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# If you already have transformers installed, please uninstall it first, or create a new Python environment
# pip uninstall transformers
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
pip install accelerate"><pre><span><span>#</span> If you already have transformers installed, please uninstall it first, or create a new Python environment</span>

<p dir="auto">We offer a toolkit to help you handle various types of audio and visual input more conveniently, providing an API-like experience. This includes support for base64, URLs, and interleaved audio, images, and videos. You can install it using the following command and make sure your system has <code>ffmpeg</code> installed:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pip install qwen-omni-utils -U"><pre>pip install qwen-omni-utils -U</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, we recommend using FlashAttention 2 when running with Hugging Face Transformers to reduce GPU memory usage. However, if you are primarily using <a href="#vllm-usage">vLLM</a> for inference, this installation is not necessary, as vLLM includes FlashAttention 2 by default.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation"><pre>pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Also, you should have hardware that is compatible with FlashAttention 2. Read more about it in the official documentation of the <a href="https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention">FlashAttention repository</a>. FlashAttention 2 can only be used when a model is loaded in <code>torch.float16</code> or <code>torch.bfloat16</code>.</p>

<summary>Change voice type of output audio</summary>

Qwen3-Omni supports changing the voice of the output audio. The `&quot;Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct&quot;` checkpoint supports three voice types as follows:

| Voice Type | Gender | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Ethan      | Male   | A bright, upbeat voice with infectious energy and a warm, approachable vibe. |
| Chelsie    | Female | A honeyed, velvety voice that carries a gentle warmth and luminous clarity. |
| Aiden      | Male   | A warm, laid-back American voice with a gentle, boyish charm. |

Users can use the `speaker` parameter of the `generate` function to specify the voice type. By default, if `speaker` is not specified, the voice type is `Ethan`.

```python
text_ids, audio = model.generate(..., speaker=&quot;Ethan&quot;)"><pre><span>model</span> <span>=</span> <span>Qwen3OmniMoeForConditionalGeneration</span>.<span>from_pretrained</span>(

<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Inference</h4><a id="user-content-inference" aria-label="Permalink: Inference" href="#inference"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can use the following code for vLLM inference. The <code>limit_mm_per_prompt</code> parameter specifies the maximum number of each modality's data allowed per message. Since vLLM needs to pre-allocate GPU memory, larger values will require more GPU memory; if OOM issues occur, try reducing this value. Setting <code>tensor_parallel_size</code> greater than one enables multi-GPU parallel inference, improving concurrency and throughput. In addition, <code>max_num_seqs</code> indicates the number of sequences that vLLM processes in parallel during each inference step. A larger value requires more GPU memory but enables higher batch inference speed. For more details, please refer to the <a href="https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/api/vllm/index.html#vllm.LLM" rel="nofollow">vLLM official documentation</a>.

<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: The table above presents the theoretical minimum memory requirements for inference with <code>transformers</code> and <code>BF16</code> precision, tested with <code>attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"</code>. The Instruct model includes both the <strong>thinker</strong> and <strong>talker</strong> components, whereas the Thinking model includes only the <strong>thinker</strong> part.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Prompt for Audio-Visual Interaction</h4><a id="user-content-prompt-for-audio-visual-interaction" aria-label="Permalink: Prompt for Audio-Visual Interaction" href="#prompt-for-audio-visual-interaction"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When using Qwen3-Omni for audio-visual multimodal interaction, where the input consists of a video and its corresponding audio (with the audio serving as a query), we recommend using the <strong>following system prompt</strong>. This setup helps the model maintain high reasoning capability while better assuming interactive roles such as a smart assistant. Additionally, the text generated by the thinker will be more readable, with a natural, conversational tone and without complex formatting that is difficult to vocalize, leading to more stable and fluent audio output from the talker. You can customize the <code>user_system_prompt</code> field in the system prompt to include character settings or other role-specific descriptions as needed.</p>

In your replies, address the user as “you/your” and yourself as “I/me/my”; never mirror the user’s pronouns—always shift perspective.

<p dir="auto">The <code>Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking</code> model is primarily designed for understanding and interacting with multimodal inputs, including text, audio, image, and video. To achieve optimal performance, we recommend that users include an explicit textual instruction or task description in each round of dialogue alongside the multimodal input. This helps clarify the intent and significantly enhances the model's ability to leverage its reasoning capabilities. For example:</p>

<p dir="auto">In this section, we provide instructions for users to build a web-based user interface (UI) demo. This UI demo allows users to interact with the model through a web browser. Follow the steps below to get start :)</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h4><a id="user-content-installation-2" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation-2"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Before you begin, we strongly recommend that you refer to the <strong>Installation</strong> section in <a href="#vllm-usage">vLLM Usage</a> to set up your environment, which will allow you to seamlessly use both the vLLM and Transformers backends. However, if you only intend to use the Transformers backend (<strong>note that this will result in significantly slower inference</strong>), please follow the installation instructions in <a href="#transformers-usage">Transformers Usage</a>. That said, we still highly recommend using our <a href="#-docker">Docker</a> image to avoid potential environment-related issues. Additionally, if you are running locally, make sure your system has <code>ffmpeg</code> installed and you install the following dependencies:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="pip install gradio==5.44.1 gradio_client==1.12.1 soundfile==0.13.1"><pre>pip install gradio==5.44.1 gradio_client==1.12.1 soundfile==0.13.1</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Running the Demo</h4><a id="user-content-running-the-demo" aria-label="Permalink: Running the Demo" href="#running-the-demo"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Once the required packages are installed, you can launch the web demo using the following commands. These commands will start a web server and provide you with a link to access the UI in your web browser. You can run <code>python web_demo.py --help</code> and <code>python web_demo_captioner.py --help</code> to learn about more options.</p>

<p dir="auto">To simplify the deployment process, we provide Docker images with pre-built environments: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/qwenllm/qwen3-omni" rel="nofollow">qwenllm/qwen3-omni</a>. You only need to install the driver and download model files to launch the demos. Please refer to the <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html" rel="nofollow">guide</a> to install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, ensuring that your Docker can access the GPU. For users in mainland China who may have difficulty accessing Docker Hub, you can use mirror acceleration services to pull the images. First, run the following command to pull and initialize the container:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="LOCAL_WORKDIR=/path/to/your/workspace
HOST_PORT=8901
CONTAINER_PORT=80
docker run --gpus all --name qwen3-omni \

    --mount type=bind,source=$LOCAL_WORKDIR,target=/data/shared/Qwen3-Omni \

    --shm-size=4gb \
    -it qwenllm/qwen3-omni:3-cu124</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">After executing the command, you will enter the bash shell of the container. Your local model and data directory (<strong>please replace</strong> <code>/path/to/your/workspace</code> <strong>with the actual path</strong>) will be mounted to the container's internal path <code>/data/shared/Qwen3-Omni</code>. The host's port <code>8901</code> is mapped to port <code>80</code> in the container, meaning you can access the service inside the container by visiting port <code>8901</code> on the host machine.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please note that services inside the container must be started with the IP <code>0.0.0.0</code> to ensure proper port forwarding. For example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Run this command inside the Docker container
python web_demo.py -c Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct --server-port 80 --server-name 0.0.0.0"><pre><span><span>#</span> Run this command inside the Docker container</span>
python web_demo.py -c Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct --server-port 80 --server-name 0.0.0.0</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">For more ways to launch the web demo, please refer to <a href="#launch-local-web-ui-demo">Launch Local Web UI Demo</a>. If you exit the container, you can re-enter it using the following command:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="docker start qwen3-omni

				<p><strong>In summary</strong></p>
				

				
				<p>The court of appeals said 21 of 23 quotes in an opening brief were fake. State authorities are scrambling to grapple with widespread use of artificial intelligence.</p>
				
							</div>
		
		

<p>A California attorney must pay a $10,000 fine for filing a state court appeal full of fake quotations generated by the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT.</p>

<p>The fine appears to be the largest issued over AI fabrications by a California court and came with a <a href="https://www4.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/B331918.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blistering opinion</a> stating that 21 of 23 quotes from cases cited in the attorney’s opening brief were made up. It also noted that numerous out-of-state and federal courts have confronted attorneys for citing fake legal authority.</p>

<p>“We therefore publish this opinion as a warning,” it continued. “Simply stated, no brief, pleading, motion, or any other paper filed in any court should contain any citations— whether provided by generative AI or any other source—that the attorney responsible for submitting the pleading has not personally read and verified.”</p>

<p>The opinion, issued 10 days ago in California’s 2nd District Court of Appeal, is a clear example of why the state’s legal authorities are scrambling to regulate the use of AI in the judiciary. The state’s Judicial Council two weeks ago <a href="https://courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index/standards/Standard10_80" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued guidelines requiring judges and court staff</a> to either ban generative AI or adopt a generative AI use policy by Dec. 15. Meanwhile, the California Bar Association is considering whether to strengthen its code of conduct to account for various forms of AI following a request by the California Supreme Court last month.</p>


<p>The Los Angeles-area attorney fined last week, Amir Mostafavi, told the court that he did not read text generated by the AI model before submitting the appeal in July 2023, months after OpenAI marketed ChatGPT as capable of <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/2023/04/19/gpt-4-passes-the-bar-exam-what-that-means-for-artificial-intelligence-tools-in-the-legal-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passing the bar exam</a>. A three-judge panel fined him for filing a frivolous appeal, violating court rules, citing fake cases, and wasting the court’s time and the taxpayers money, according to the opinion.</p>

<p>Mostafavi told CalMatters he wrote the appeal and then used ChatGPT to try and improve it. He said that he didn’t know it would add case citations or make things up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He thinks it is unrealistic to expect lawyers to stop using AI. It’s become an important tool just as online databases largely replaced law libraries and, until AI systems stop hallucinating fake information, he suggests lawyers who use AI to proceed with caution.</p>

<p>“In the meantime we’re going to have some victims, we’re going to have some damages, we’re going to have some wreckages,” he said. “I hope this example will help others not fall into the hole. I’m paying the price.”</p>


<p>The fine issued to Mostafavi is the most costly penalty issued to an attorney by a California state court and one of the highest fines ever issued over attorney use of&nbsp; AI, according to Damien Charlotin, who teaches a class on AI and the law at a business school in Paris. He <a href="https://www.damiencharlotin.com/hallucinations/">tracks</a> instances of attorneys citing fake cases, primarily in Australia, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>In a widely-publicized case in May, a U.S. district court judge in California <a href="https://websitedc.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Lacey_v._State_Farm_General_Insurances_Co._D._Cal._May_6_2025.pdf">ordered two law firms to pay</a> $31,100 in fees to defense counsel and the court for costs associated with using “bogus AI-generated research.” In that ruling, the judge described feeling misled, said they almost cited fake material in a judicial order and said “Strong deterrence is needed to make sure that attorneys don’t succumb to this easy shortcut.”</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>“We’re going to have some wreckages.”</p><cite>Amir Mostafavi, lawyer fined $10,000 after submitting opening brief filled with quotes fabricated by ChatGPT</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p>Charlotin thinks courts and the public should expect to see an exponential rise in these cases in the future. When he started tracking court filings involving AI and fake cases earlier this year, he encountered a few cases a month. Now he sees a few cases a day. Large language models confidently state falsehoods as facts, particularly when there are no supporting facts.</p>

<p>“The harder your legal argument is to make, the more the model will tend to hallucinate, because they will try to please you,” he said. “That’s where the confirmation bias kicks in.”</p>

<p>A <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/news/ai-trial-legal-models-hallucinate-1-out-6-or-more-benchmarking-queries">May 2024 analysis</a> by Stanford University’s RegLab found that although three out of four lawyers plan to use generative AI in their practice, some forms of AI generate hallucinations in one out of three queries. Detecting fake material cited in legal filings <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/technology/ai-hallucinations-chatgpt-google.html">could get harder as models grow in size</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ailawlibrarians.com/2025/08/10/coming-soon-the-interactive-genai-legal-hallucination-tracker-sneak-peek-today/">Another tracker</a> of cases where lawyers cite nonexistent legal authority due to use of AI identifies 52 such cases in California and more than 600 nationwide.<strong> </strong>That amount is expected to increase in the near future because AI innovation is outpacing the education of attorneys, said Nicholas Sanctis, a law student at Capital University Law School in Ohio.</p>

<p>Jenny Wondracek, who leads the tracker project, said she expects this trend to get worse because she still regularly encounters lawyers who don’t know that AI makes things up or believe that legal tech tools can eliminate all fake or false material generated by language models.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I think we’d see a reduction if (lawyers) just understood the basics of the technology,” she said.</p>

<p>Like Charlotin, she suspects there are more instances of made up cases generated by AI in state court filings than in federal courts, but a lack of standard filing methods makes it difficult to verify that. She said she encounters fake cases most often among overburdened attorneys or people who choose to represent themselves in family court.</p>

<p>She suspects the number of arguments filed by attorneys that use AI and cite fake cases will continue to go up, but added that not just attorneys engage in the practice. In recent weeks, she’s documented three <a href="https://www.ailawlibrarians.com/2025/07/03/first-known-court-order-with-fabricated-cases-and-a-test-run-of-citecheck-ai/">instances of judges</a> citing fake legal authority in their decisions.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>She’s documented three judges citing fake legal authority in their decisions.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>As California considers how to treat generative AI and fake case citations, Wondracek said they can consider approaches taken by other states, such as temporary suspensions, requiring attorneys who get caught to take courses to better understand how to ethically use AI, or requiring them to <a href="https://www.lawnext.com/2025/09/nevada-judge-takes-creative-and-unusual-approach-to-combat-ai-generated-fictitious-citations.html">teach law students how they can avoid making the same mistake</a>.</p>

<p>Mark McKenna, codirector of the UCLA Institute of Technology, Law &amp; Policy praised fines like the one against Mostafavi as punishing lawyers for “an abdication of your responsibility as a party representing someone.” He thinks the problem “will get worse before it gets better,” because there’s been a rush among law schools and private firms to adopt AI without thinking through the appropriate way to use them.</p>

<p>UCLA School of Law professor Andrew Selbst agrees, pointing out that clerks that work for judges are recent law school graduates, and students are getting bombarded with the message that they must use AI or get left behind. Educators and other professionals <a href="https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2024/06/teachers-ai-grading/">report feeling similar pressures</a>.</p>

<p>“This is getting shoved down all our throats,” he said. “It’s being pushed in firms and schools and a lot of places and we have not yet grappled with the consequences of that.”</p>

<p><strong>For the record</strong>: The fine issued to Mostafavi was for $10,000. Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article had an incorrect figure.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><article id="e20250922T120408"><header><p><a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/archive/date0922.html">Monday 22</a> <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/archive/year2025.html#month202509">September 2025</a></p><p>People should spend less time learning DSA, more time learning testing.</p></header><p>I see new learners asking about “DSA” a lot.  Data Structures and Algorithms
are of course important: considered broadly, they are the two ingredients that
make up all programs.  But in my opinion, “DSA” as an abstract field of study
is over-emphasized.</p><p>I understand why people focus on DSA: it’s a concrete thing to learn about,
there are web sites devoted to testing you on it, and most importantly, because
job interviews often involve DSA coding questions.</p><p>Before I get to other opinions, let me make clear that anything you can do to
help you get a job is a good thing to do.  If grinding
<a rel="external noopener" href="https://leetcode.com/">leetcode</a> will land you a position, then do it.</p><p>But I hope companies hiring entry-level engineers aren’t asking them to
reverse linked lists or balance trees.  Asking about techniques that can be
memorized ahead of time won’t tell them anything about how well you can work.
The stated purpose of those interviews is to see how well you can figure out
solutions, in which case memorization will defeat the point.</p><p>The thing new learners don’t understand about DSA is that actual software
engineering almost never involves implementing the kinds of algorithms that
“DSA” teaches you.  Sure, it can be helpful to work through some of these
puzzles and see how they are solved, but writing real code just doesn’t involve
writing that kind of code.</p><p>Here is what I think in-the-trenches software engineers should know about
data structures and algorithms:</p><ul><li>Data structures are ways to organize data. Learn some of the basics: linked
list, array, hash table, tree.  By “learn” I mean understand what it does
and why you might want to use one.</li><li>Different data structures can be used to organize the same data in different
ways.  Learn some of the trade-offs between structures that are similar.</li><li>Algorithms are ways of manipulating data.  I don’t mean named algorithms
like Quicksort, but algorithms as any chunk of code that works on data and
does something with it.</li><li>How you organize data affects what algorithms you can use to work with the
data.  Some data structures will be slow for some operations where another
structure will be fast.</li><li>Algorithms have a “time complexity” (Big O): <a rel="external noopener" href="https://nedbatchelder.com/text/bigo.html">how the code
slows as the data grows</a>.  Get a sense of what this means.</li><li>Python has a number of built-in data structures.  Learn how they work, and
the time complexity of their operations.</li><li>Learn how to think about your code to understand its time complexity.</li><li>Read a little about more esoteric things like <a rel="external noopener" href="https://systemdesign.one/bloom-filters-explained/">Bloom
filters</a>, so you can find them later in the unlikely case you need them.</li></ul><p>Here are some things you don’t need to learn:</p><ul><li>The details of a dozen different sorting algorithms.  Look at two to see
different ways of approaching the same problem, then move on.</li><li>The names of “important” algorithms.  Those have all been implemented for
you.</li><li>The answers to all N problems on some quiz web site.  You won’t be asked
these exact questions, and they won’t come up in your real work.  Again: try a
few to get a feel for how some algorithms work.  The exact answers are not what
you need.</li></ul><p>Of course some engineers need to implement hash tables, or sorting algorithms
or whatever.  We love those engineers: they write libraries we can use off the
shelf so we don’t have to implement them ourselves.</p><p>There have been times when I implemented something that felt like An
Algorithm (for example, <a href="https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201707/finding_fuzzy_floats.html">Finding fuzzy floats</a>), but it was
more about considering another perspective on my data, looking at the time
complexity, and moving operations around to avoid quadratic behavior. It wasn’t
opening a textbook to find the famous algorithm that would solve my problem.</p><p>Again: if it will help you get a job, deep-study DSA. But don’t be
disappointed when you don’t use it on the job.</p><p>If you want to prepare yourself for a career, and also stand out in job
interviews, learn how to write tests:</p><ul><li>This will be a skill you use constantly. Real-world software means writing
tests much more than school teaches you to.</li><li>In a job search, testing experience will stand out more than DSA depth.  It
shows you’ve thought about what it takes to write high-quality software instead
of just academic exercises.</li><li>It’s not obvious how to test code well. It’s a puzzle and a problem to
solve.  If you like figuring out solutions to tricky questions, focus on how to
write code so that it can be tested, and how to test it.</li><li>Testing not only gives you more confidence in your code, it helps you write
better code in the first place.</li><li>Testing applies everywhere, from tiny bits of code to entire architectures,
assisting you in design and implementation at all scales.</li><li>If pursued diligently, testing is an engineering discipline in its own
right, with a fascinating array of tools and techniques.</li></ul><p>Less DSA, more testing.</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="s_content"><p><span><em>30 news pieces a day in 2024 on non-existent exodus</em></span></p><p>A millionaire exodus widely reported by news outlets around the world in 2024, and credited for the UK Labour government’s decision to weaken tax reforms, did not occur, the Tax Justice Network reveals.</p><p>The media reporting – consisting of over 10,900 news pieces across print, broadcast and online news in 2024 – was primarily based on a report published by Henley &amp; Partners<sup>1</sup>, a firm that sells golden passports to the superrich and advises governments on setting up such schemes. The European Court of Justice recently ruled one such scheme, that of Malta, to be unlawful.<sup>2</sup></p><p>The Tax Justice Network’s review – co-published with Patriotic Millionaires UK and Tax Justice UK – of the Henley report finds that the number of millionaires claimed by Henley &amp; Partners to be leaving countries in “exodus” in 2024 represented near-0% of those countries’ millionaire populations.<sup>3</sup> For example, the 9500 millionaires widely reported to be leaving the UK in 2024 represented 0.3% of the UK’s 3.06 million millionaires.<sup>4</sup></p><p>Media reporting widely blamed the alleged millionaire exodus on tax policies in the same year that calls for a wealth tax on the superrich gained unprecedented momentum globally.<sup>5</sup> The media reporting was equivalent to 30 news pieces a day on the non-existent millionaire exodus across 2024.</p><p>Reviewing the full period from 2013 to 2024 for which the Henley report presents estimates on millionaire migration, the Tax Justice Network finds that millionaire migration rates consistently stood at near-0% for every year.<sup>6</sup> Academic studies consistently show that the tax responses of the wealthy involves minimal levels of migration.<sup>7</sup></p><p>Henley’s estimates, when put into perspective, reveal a picture that is at complete odds with the report’s narrative and media coverage: millionaires are highly immobile, and nearly 100% of millionaires have <em>not</em> relocated to a new country since 2013, if Henley’s estimates are to be taken at face value.</p><p>Henley &amp; Partners was accused in a 2018 UK Parliamentary inquiry of meddling in the elections of Caribbean nations in return for the exclusive rights to sell golden passports.<sup>8</sup> Henley &amp; Partners told The Guardian it “fundamentally rejects any allegation of wrongdoing”.<sup>9</sup> A recent Financial Times article identified an EU-sanctioned Russian businessman with links to the Ukraine invasion who could more easily circumvent travel restrictions due to a Maltese golden passport Henley helped him acquire in the past.<sup>10</sup> A spokesperson for Henley &amp; Partners told the Financial Times that while she “could not comment on individual cases because of missing information and data protection… an individual ‘may pass all the stringent due diligence tests imposed, but still go on to engage in criminal activity.’”<sup>11 </sup></p><p>Golden passports are now illegal in the EU following a successful court challenge brought by the European Commission against Malta’s scheme, on which Henley &amp; Partners had advised. The Commission said such schemes pose serious risks for money laundering, tax evasion and corruption.<sup>12</sup> Henley &amp; Partners told media in response that it was “disappointed” but that the decision “will only increase the demand for specialized advisors”.<sup>13</sup></p><p><span><strong>Findings behind Labour climbdown riddled with problems</strong></span></p><p>The UK Labour government’s decision in January 2025 to weaken non-dom tax reform was widely reported to be a result of concerns about the Henley report’s findings.<sup>14</sup></p><p>The Tax Justice Network’s review of the Henley report flags several issues with the report’s methodology as well as contradictions in Henley &amp; Partner’s reporting, and particularly in its claims on the UK exodus.</p><p>Strikingly, the report’s methodology<sup>15</sup> states that its estimates are primarily a measure of where millionaires <em>say they work on social media</em> and not of where they live or reside, meaning the report does not track actual, physical migration – contrary to the presenting of the estimates in the press.</p><p>Moreover, the report uses a far narrower definition of ‘millionaires’ that does not include all dollar millionaires like the standard definition (people with net worth of 1 million dollars or more), but rather only individuals with liquid assets worth 1 million dollars or more, who are thus richer and more mobile on average than a standardly defined millionaire.<sup>16</sup> In the case of the UK, the ‘millionaires’ identified by the report represent just a fifth (20%) of the UK millionaire population.<sup>17 </sup>Even then, the report is based on a small sample from within these narrowly defined millionaires and the sample is skewed towards centi-millionaires and billionaires, who are also likely to be the most easily mobile.<sup>18</sup></p><p>Just as striking, the use of the term “exodus” has been inconsistent in the analysis. In 2021, Henley described 2000 millionaires leaving the UK as “insignificant” but in 2023 described 1600 millionaires leaving the UK an “exodus”. In 2023, the 6500 millionaires claimed to be leaving India were described as “not particularly concerning” but redescribed in 2024 as a “wealth exodus”.<sup>19</sup></p><p>The Tax Justice Network wrote to Henley &amp; Partners and New World Wealth (who prepared the Henley report’s estimates) with questions for each ahead of the publication of its review. The response received said<sup>20</sup>:</p><p><em>“It seems this entire debate is over that one word. The dictionary definition is just ‘mass migration’, and HMRC’s own data shows that the number of non-doms in the UK is decreasing year on year – which seems to be a mass migration. If you are looking to the biblical definition, then to use the term ‘exodus’ would of course mean that all non-doms are leaving, but I don’t think many people take biblical interpretations quite so literally?”</em></p><p>Furthermore, Henley &amp; Partners labelled the UK’s alleged exodus a <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/publications/henley-private-wealth-migration-report-2023/private-wealth-insights/transformative-era-investment-migration">“Brexodus”</a> in 2023, claiming that the exodus was largely an impact of Brexit.<sup>21 </sup>In October 2024, Henley relabelled the exodus a <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/newsroom/press-releases/uk-wealth-exodus">“Wexit”</a> in a press release framing the UK exodus as a reaction to tax hikes that might be announced in the UK Labour government’s upcoming budget statement.<sup>22</sup></p><p>Henley &amp; Partners’ specified in October 2024 that the “Wexit” is a “wealth exodus” that includes centi-millionaires and billionaires, and the report’s author emphasised that “[t]he large number of centi-millionaires leaving the UK is particularly concerning”.<sup>23</sup> These claims appear inconsistent with Henley’s forecast made the month prior in September 2024 that the UK centi-millionaire population is growing and will continue to grow from 2024 to 2040.<sup>24</sup></p><p>The press release highlighted that the UK Labour government’s budget statement as a main reason for this alleged “wealth exodus”:</p><p><em>“The UK’s high tax rates and concerns about additional tax hikes that could be announced at the end of the month in the Labour Party’s first budget in 14 years, are highlighted as being among the main reasons for the wealth exodus.”<sup>25</sup></em></p><p>A response sent by Henley &amp; Partners to the Tax Justice Network said:</p><p><em>“We have never claimed that Labour tax policies were the sole or root cause.&nbsp; If papers such as the Telegraph, Times, Mail, decide to add their own layer on to that, and deliberately exclude from their story our standard reminder to them that these were the Conservatives’ tax changes, then I think your argument is with them not with us.”</em></p><p>Moreover, it is unclear whether the forecast of centi-millionaires and billionaires leaving the UK that Henley reported in October 2024 was different from the forecast it initially made in June 2024 when the Labour party was not in power.</p><p><span><strong>Media adds fuel to the fictional fire</strong></span></p><p>The Tax Justice Network’s analysis of media coverage of the Henley report finds that coverage often went far beyond any claims made in the report itself, contributing to an entirely unfounded narrative about the role of tax and government policies in causing a millionaire exodus which itself did not occur.</p><p>Tax was mentioned in half of global media coverage of the exodus and far more often than any other exodus drivers discussed in the Henley report.</p><p>The UK Labour party, which was not in power when the report was published in June 2024, was mentioned more than twice as much as the UK Conservative party in global media coverage, and nearly four times as much as Brexit in UK media coverage.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI4MDAiIGhlaWdodD0iNDc0IiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgODAwIDQ3NCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgc3R5bGU9ImZpbGw6I2NmZDRkYjtmaWxsLW9wYWNpdHk6IDAuMTsiLz48L3N2Zz4=" loading="lazy" data-src="https://taxjustice.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Graph-drivers-in-the-media.png" alt="" width="800" height="474"><br>
<span>Note: Percentages show the number of mentions as a share of all global media coverage &nbsp;</span></p><p>The picture is more skewed in UK media coverage, where tax was mentioned in 71% of coverage and Labour mentioned in 43% of coverage.<sup>26</sup></p><p>Seven high-profile millionaires leaving the UK were mentioned nearly three times more often in global media coverage than pro-tax millionaire campaign groups representing hundreds of millionaires.<sup>27</sup></p><p>In contrast to the media narrative, 81% of UK millionaires agree with the statement that it is patriotic to pay a fair share of tax, according to a poll published on 5 June 2025 by Patriotic Millionaires UK. 80% of UK millionaires said they would support a wealth tax of 2% on wealth over £10 million.<sup>28</sup></p><p>The Tax Justice Network’s review of the Henley report raised a number of other questions, including the statistical credibility of drawing any conclusions from a self-admittedly unrepresentative sample; and the degree of extrapolation necessary to make any findings about smaller groups such as billionaires.</p><p>On the report’s sample, the response sent by Henley &amp; Partners said:</p><p><em>“Statistically, if it is consistent year by year, then laws of statistical sampling mean that it can be used to draw a conclusion.”</em></p><p>The report is published by Henley &amp; Partners but prepared by New World Wealth<sup>29</sup>, which describes itself as a “wealth intelligence firm” on its website. New World Wealth appears to have only one staff member and has not made the data behind its calculations public.</p><p>New World Wealth has been publishing estimates on millionaire migrations for at least a decade, and first began to publish its estimates with Henley &amp; Partners in 2022, which was the first time the estimates on millionaire migrations underway were described as an “exodus”.</p><p>More specific questions about the sample sent to New World Wealth, including a question asking how many real persons in the sample were observed to have “migrated” in 2024, were not responded to.</p><p><strong>Fariya Mohiuddin</strong>, Deputy Director: External Affairs at Tax Justice UK said:</p><p><em>“Taxing the super-rich to revitalise key services like the NHS and education, that we all rely on, is more urgent than ever. Taxing the wealth of the richest is simply not going to cause a mass exodus. This is scaremongering and statistical obfuscation by companies that represent the interests of billionaires and multi-millionaires. In fact, when the numbers are crunched properly, rather than using dodgy stats and figures, tax is an inconsequential factor in the decision-making of the vanishingly small percentage of millionaires that do decide to move. In fact, many wealthy people want to pay more tax. They know that when public services are well-funded, people are healthy, and the country works better, they will benefit – alongside everyone else.”</em></p><p>Member of Patriotic Millionaires UK and legal consultant, <strong>Stephen Kinsella</strong> said:</p><p><em>“As this excellent report from the Tax Justice Network shows, millionaires like me aren’t going anywhere.&nbsp;We want to build a better&nbsp;Britain so we’re proud to pay&nbsp;and here to stay.&nbsp;When nearly three quarters of UK millionaires think taxes should be raised on the richest to reduce the strain on everyone else, and 81%&nbsp;think it’s patriotic to pay their fair share in tax, what on earth is stopping our Government from doing their duty and taxing extreme wealth?”</em></p><p><strong>Alex Cobham</strong>, chief executive at the Tax Justice Network, said:</p><p><em>“The majority of people want taxes on the superrich, the majority of millionaires are saying tax us, and practically all credible studies say you should do it. But &nbsp;what the media reported, and the government listened to, was a fictional millionaire ‘exodus’ based on questionable data published by a firm that helps the superrich buy their way out of the rules that apply to everybody else. Tax is our most powerful tool for creating more equal societies, but scare stories like these are used to talk down to people and to block positive change.” &nbsp;</em></p><p><em>“This is a wakeup call for media professionals and governments alike. Do your homework when it comes to tax. Treat the Henley report and any such claims about fleeing millionaires with extreme caution, and make sure your stories and your policy decisions are based on robust evidence.”</em></p><p>-ENDS-</p><p><strong>Read </strong><a href="https://taxjustice.net/reports/the-millionaire-exodus-myth/"><strong>our review of the Henley report</strong></a></p><p><strong>Notes to Editor</strong></p><ol><li>The <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/publications/henley-private-wealth-migration-report-2024/">Henley Private Wealth Migration Report 2024</a> was published on 18 June 2024 by <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/">Henley &amp; Partners</a>.

Presenter Tim Harford challenged Mr Amolis further (emphasis added):<strong>Andrew Amoils</strong>: Most of the database – I’d say between twenty and a hundred million dollars in assets, that would be the bulk of the database. So our data is skewed to the top end, so there will be the billionaires and the centimillionaires with over a hundred million, with some of the people lower down it’s more difficult to know if they are a high net worth.<strong>Tim Harford</strong>: But wait, aren’t these super-rich more easily able to skip off to Monaco or Dubai than your run of a mill dollar millionaire?<strong>AA</strong>: No, you’re right, 100%, that would be an issue. Though I would argue that the super-wealthy leaving is obviously the most important, because if you’ve got a banker at Goldman Sachs who’s making five hundred thousand pounds a year and they leave, that has very little impact whereas if somebody with over a hundred million who’s got a business leaves, the impact’s much greater.<strong>TH</strong>: Sure, but the headlines are not about a few people controlling a huge amount of money leaving, the headlines are about 9000 millionaires leaving. So the headlines imply that there is some kind of representative sample, and there’s some kind of reasonable extrapolation, but from <strong>based on what you’ve told me I don’t think we really can reasonably extrapolate</strong>, given the methods you’re describing.<strong>AA</strong>: Well how else would you do it? I mean, we’ve got a sample of 150000 high net worths globally, and we’re tracking them in terms of their movements. How else would you do it? How else would you work out where people are going, apart from the way we’re doing it?<strong>TH</strong>: Well I think <strong>if you don’t have a representative sample, you don’t have any basis to make the claim at all</strong>.<strong>AA</strong>: Well I would argue it is a representative sample. 150000 people, that’s a lot!<strong>TH</strong>: <strong>But you just told us it wasn’t representative.</strong> The sheer number of people doesn’t make it representative.</li><li>The term “exodus” has been used inconsistently, as this table shows.<br>

The press release was syndicated at least 400 times across the media landscape in large part due to the PR Newswire service. While Henley’s original press release did list in its notes to editor Brexit as possible driver of exodus, the notes to editor were cut off in the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/wexit-wealthy-brits-exit-uk-for-eu-ahead-of-budget-302280346.html">PR Newswire version</a> of the press release that was widely syndicated. Nonetheless, Henley’s October 2024 press release did refer to Brexit in the body of the release, but when doing so contrasted Brexit as a positive phenomenon that is separate from the wealth exodus. The press release stated: “Based on data over the past nine months, the UK’s wealth exodus or WEXIT is expected to include 85 centi-millionaires and 10 billionaires, and in an ironic reversal of Brexit fortunes, 68% are heading for Europe, with favored destinations being Italy, Malta, Greece, Portugal, Switzerland, Monaco, Cyprus, France, Spain, and the Netherlands.”</li><li>Henley’s <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/publications/centi-millionaire-report-2024"><em>The Centi-Millionaire Report 2024</em></a> was published on 17 September 2024.</li><li>See note 22.</li><li>Looking specifically at UK media coverage, we find the mentions of themes and drivers to be far more skewed towards tax and Labour.<br>

We like to celebrate our birthday by announcing new products and features that give back to the Internet, which we’ll do a lot of this week. But, on this occasion, we've also been thinking about what's changed on the Internet over the last 15 years and what has not.</p><p>With some things there's been clear progress: when we launched in 2010 less than 10 percent of the Internet was encrypted, today well over 95 percent is encrypted. We're proud of the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-universal-ssl/"><u>role we played in making that happen</u></a>.</p>

          </figure><p>Some other areas have seen limited progress: IPv6 adoption has grown steadily but painfully slowly over the last 15 years, in <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflares-automatic-ipv6-gatewa/"><u>spite</u></a> <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-expanding-the-ipv6-web/"><u>of</u></a> <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-the-last-reasons-to-not-enable-ipv6/"><u>our</u></a> <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/amazon-2bn-ipv4-tax-how-avoid-paying/"><u>efforts</u></a>. That's a problem because as IPv4 addresses have become scarce and expensive it’s held back new entrants and driven up the costs of things like networking and cloud computing.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="the-internets-business-model">The Internet’s Business Model</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>Still other things have remained remarkably consistent: the basic business model of the Internet has for the last 15 years been the same — create compelling content, find a way to be discovered, and then generate value from the resulting traffic. Whether that was through ads or subscriptions or selling things or just the ego of knowing that someone is consuming what you created, traffic generation has been the engine that powered the Internet we know today.</p><p>Make no mistake, the Internet has never been free. There's always been a reward system that transferred value from consumers to creators and, in doing so, filled the Internet with content. Had the Internet not had that reward system it wouldn't be nearly as vibrant as it is today.</p><p>A bit of a trivia aside: why did Cloudflare never build an ad blocker <a href="https://www.answeroverflow.com/m/1123890164222144542"><u>despite many requests</u></a>? Because, as imperfect as they are, ads have been the only micropayment system that has worked at scale to encourage an open Internet while also compensating content creators for their work. Our mission is to help build a better Internet, and a core value is that we’re principled, so we weren’t going to hamper the Internet’s fundamental business model.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="traffic-value">Traffic ≠ Value</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>But that same traffic-based reward system has also created many of the problems we lament about the current state of the Internet. Traffic has always been an imperfect proxy for value. Over the last 15 years we've watched more of the Internet driven by annoying clickbait or dangerous ragebait. Entire media organizations have built their businesses with a stated objective of writing headlines to generate the maximum cortisol response because that's what generates the maximum amount of traffic.</p><p>Over the years, Cloudflare has at times faced calls for us to intervene and control what content can be published online. As an infrastructure provider, we've never felt we were the right place for those editorial decisions to be made. But it wasn't because we didn't worry about the direction the traffic-incentivized Internet seemed to be headed. It always seemed like what fundamentally needed to change was not more content moderation at the infrastructure level but instead a healthier incentive system for content creation.</p><p>Today the conditions to bring about that change may be happening. In the last year, something core to the Internet we’ve all known has changed. It's being driven by AI and it has an opportunity with some care and nurturing to help bring about what we think may be a much better Internet.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="from-search-to-answers">From Search to Answers</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>What’s the change? The primary discovery system of the Internet for the last 15 years has been Search Engines. They scraped the Internet's content, built an index, and then presented users with a treasure map which they followed generating traffic. Content creators were happy to let Search Engines scrape their content because there were a limited number of them, so the infrastructure costs were relatively low and, more importantly, because the Search Engines gave something to sites in the form of traffic —&nbsp;the Internet’s historic currency —&nbsp;sent back to sites.</p><p>It’s already clear that the Internet’s discovery system for the next 15 years will be something different: Answer Engines. Unlike Search Engines which gave you a map where you hunted for what you were looking for, driving traffic in the process, Answer Engines just give you the answer without you having to click on anything. For 95 percent of users 95 percent of the time, that is a better user experience.</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5d2TQwVHA8GpFUBpAdr8QT/23fd6b7306d55dce3dea9e989784595d/BLOG-2994_3.png" alt="BLOG-2994 3" width="1801" height="564" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>You don’t have to look far to see this is changing rapidly before our eyes. ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and other AI startups aren’t Search Engines — they’re Answer Engines. Even Google, the search stalwart, is increasingly serving “AI Overviews” in place of 10 blue links. We can often look to sci-fi movies to have a glimpse into our most likely future. In them, the helpful intelligent robot character didn’t answer questions with: “Here are some links you can click on to maybe find what you’re looking for.” Whether you like it or not, the future will increasingly be answers not searches.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="short-term-pain">Short Term Pain</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>In the short term, this is going to be extremely painful for some industries that are built based on monetizing traffic. It already is. While ecommerce and social applications haven't yet seen a significant drop in traffic as the world switches to Answer Engines, media companies have. Why the difference? Well, for the former, you still need to buy the thing the Answer Engine recommends and, for now, we still value talking with other humans.</p><p>But for media companies, if the Answer Engine gives you the summary of what you’re looking for in most cases you don’t need to read the story. And the loss of traffic for media companies has already been dramatic. It’s not just traditional media. Research groups at investment banks, industry analysts, major consulting firms —&nbsp;they’re all seeing major drops in people finding their content because we are increasingly getting answers not search treasure maps.</p><p>Some say these answer engines or agents are just acting on behalf of humans. Sure but so what? Without a change they will still kill content creators’ businesses. If you ask your agent to summarize twenty different news sources but never actually visit any of them you’re still undermining the business model of those news sources. Agents don’t click on ads. And if those agents are allowed to aggregate information on behalf of multiple users it’s an even bigger problem because then subscription revenue is eliminated as well. Why subscribe to the Wall Street Journal or New York Times or Financial Times or Washington Post if my agent can free ride off some other user who does?</p><p>Unless you believe that content creators should work for free, or that they are somehow not needed anymore —&nbsp;both of which are naive assumptions —&nbsp;something needs to change. A visit from an agent isn’t the same as a visit from a human and therefore should have different rules of the road. If nothing changes, the drop in human traffic to the media ecosystem writ large will kill the business model that has built the content-rich Internet we enjoy today.</p><p>We think that’s an existential threat to one of humanity’s most important creations: the Internet.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="rewarding-better-content">Rewarding Better Content</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>But there’s reason for optimism. Content is the fuel that powers every AI system and the companies that run those AI systems know ultimately they need to financially support the ecosystem. Because of that it seems potentially we're on the cusp of a new, better, and maybe healthier Internet business model. As content creators use tools like the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-ai-crawl-control/"><u>ones provided by Cloudflare to restrict AI robots from taking their content without compensation</u></a>, we're already seeing a market emerge and better deals being struck between AI and content companies.</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5J0hmMolAcrPKBZSJzKNMw/d78a04e0ae0afb2c578e7b7c1ca8b1c9/BLOG-2994_4.png" alt="BLOG-2994 4" width="1200" height="262" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>What's most interesting is what content companies are getting the best deals. It's not the ragebait headline writers. It's not the news organizations writing yet another take on what's going on in politics. It's not the spammy content farms full of drivel. Instead, it's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-17/reddit-seeks-to-strike-next-ai-content-pact-with-google-openai"><u>Reddit</u></a> and other quirky corners that best remind us of the Internet of old. For those of you old enough, think back to the Internet not of the last 15 years but of the last 35. We’ve lost some of what made that early Internet great, but there are indications that we might finally have the incentives to bring more of it back.</p><p>It seems increasingly likely that in our future, AI-driven Internet —&nbsp;assuming the AI companies are willing to step up, support the ecosystem, and pay for the content that is the most valuable to them — it’s the creative, local, unique, original content that’ll be worth the most. And, if you’re like us, the thing you as an Internet consumer are craving more of is creative, local, unique, original content. And, it turns out, having talked with many of them, that’s the content that content creators are most excited to create.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="a-new-internet-business-model">A New Internet Business Model</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>So how will the business model work? Well, for the first time in history, we have a pretty good mathematical representation of human knowledge. Sum up all the LLMs and that's what you get. It's not perfect, but it's pretty good. Inherently, the same mathematical model serves as a map for the gaps in human knowledge. Like a block of Swiss Cheese — there's a lot of cheese, but there's also a lot of holes.</p><p>Imagine a future business model of the Internet that doesn't reward traffic-generating ragebait but instead rewards those content creators that help fill in the holes in our collective metaphorical cheese. That will involve some portion of the subscription fees AI companies collect, and some portion of the revenue from the ads they'll inevitably serve, going back to content creators who most enrich the collective knowledge.</p><p>As a rough and simplistic sketch, think of it as some number of dollars per AI company’s monthly active users going into a collective pool to be distributed out to content creators based on what most fills in the holes in the cheese.</p><p>You could imagine an AI company suggesting back to creators that they need more created about topics they may not have enough content about. Say, for example, the carrying capacity of unladened swallows because they know their subscribers of a certain age and proclivity are always looking for answers about that topic. The very pruning algorithms the AI companies use today form a roadmap for what content is worth enough to not be pruned but paid for.</p><p>While today the budget items that differentiate AI companies are how much they can afford to spend on GPUs and top talent, as those things inevitably become more and more commodities it seems likely what will differentiate the different AIs is their access to creative, local, unique, original content. And the math of their algorithms provides them a map of what’s worth the most. While there are a lot of details to work out, those are the ingredients you need for a healthy market.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="cloudflares-role">Cloudflare’s Role</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>As we think about our role at Cloudflare in this developing market, it's not about protecting the status quo but instead helping catalyze a better business model for the future of Internet content creation. That means creating a level playing field. Ideally there should be lots of AI companies, large and small, and lots of content creators, large and small.</p><p>It can’t be that a new entrant AI company is at a disadvantage to a legacy search engine because one has to pay for content but the other gets it for free. But it’s also critical to realize that the right solution to that current conundrum isn’t that no one pays, it’s that, new or old, everyone who benefits from the ecosystem should contribute back to it based on their relative size.</p><p>It may seem impossibly idealistic today, but the good news is that based on the conversations we’ve had we’re confident if a few market participants tip —&nbsp;whether because they step up and do the right thing or are compelled — we will see the entire market tipping and becoming robust very quickly.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="supporting-the-ecosystem">Supporting the Ecosystem</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>We can't do this alone and we have no plans to try to. Our mission is not to “build a better Internet” but to “<b><i>help</i></b> build a better Internet.” The solutions developed to facilitate this market need to be open, collaborative, standardized, and shared across many organizations. We’ll take some encouraging steps in that direction with announcements on partnerships and collaborations this week. And we’re proud to be a leader in this space.</p><p>The Internet is an ecosystem and we, other infrastructure providers, along with most importantly both AI companies and content creators, will be critical in ensuring that ecosystem is healthy. We’re excited to partner with those who are ready to step up and do their part to also help build a better Internet. It is possible.</p>

        <p>
            Two mathematicians have proved that a straightforward question — how hard is it to untie a knot? — has a complicated answer.        </p>
        
    </div><div>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>In 1876, Peter Guthrie Tait set out to measure what he called the “<a href="https://webhomes.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/beknot.pdf">beknottedness</a>” of knots.</p>
<p>The Scottish mathematician, whose research laid the foundation for modern knot theory, was trying to find a way to tell knots apart — a notoriously difficult task. In math, a knot is a tangled piece of string with its ends glued together. Two knots are the same if you can twist and stretch one into the other without cutting the string. But it’s hard to tell if this is possible based solely on what the knots look like. A knot that seems really complicated and tangled, for instance, might actually be equivalent to a simple loop.</p>
<p>Tait had an idea for how to determine if two knots are different. First, lay a knot flat on a table and find a spot where the string crosses over itself. Cut the string, swap the positions of the strands, and glue everything back together. This is called a crossing change. If you do this enough times, you’ll be left with an unknotted circle. Tait’s beknottedness is the minimum number of crossing changes that this process requires. Today, it’s known as a knot’s “unknotting number.”</p>
<p>If two knots have different unknotting numbers, then they must be different. But Tait found that his unknotting numbers generated more questions than they answered.</p>
<p>“I have got so thoroughly on one groove,” he wrote in <a href="https://clerkmaxwellfoundation.org/PritchardTaitBooklet.pdf">a letter to a friend</a>, the scientist James Clerk Maxwell, “that I fear I may be missing or unduly exalting something which will appear excessively simple to anyone but myself.”</p>
</div>
    </div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>If Tait missed something, so did every mathematician who followed him. Over the past 150 years, many knot theorists have been baffled by the unknotting number. They know it can provide a powerful description of a knot. “It’s the most fundamental [measure] of all, arguably,” said <a href="https://shermiller.github.io/Susan_Hermiller/">Susan Hermiller</a> of the University of Nebraska. But it’s often impossibly hard to compute a knot’s unknotting number, and it’s not always clear how that number corresponds to the knot’s complexity.</p>

<p>To untangle this mystery, mathematicians in the early 20th century devised a straightforward conjecture about how the unknotting number changes when you combine knots. If they could prove it, they would have a way to compute the unknotting number for any knot — giving mathematicians a simple, concrete way to measure knot complexity.</p>
<p>Researchers searched for nearly a century, finding little evidence either for or against the conjecture.</p>
<p>Then, in a paper posted in June, Hermiller and her longtime collaborator <a href="https://markbrittenham.github.io/UNL_webpages/">Mark Brittenham</a> uncovered a pair of knots that, when combined, form a knot that is easier to untie than the conjecture predicts. In doing so, they <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24088">disproved the conjecture</a> — and used their counterexample to find infinitely many other pairs of knots that also disprove it.</p>
<p>“When the paper was posted, I gasped out loud,” said <a href="https://allisonhmoore.github.io/">Allison Moore</a> of Virginia Commonwealth University.</p>
<p>The result demonstrates that “the unknotting number is chaotic and unpredictable and really exciting to study,” she added. The paper is “like waving a flag that says, we don’t understand this.”</p>
<h2><strong>Unknotting and the Great Unknown</strong></h2>
<p>The conjecture dates back to at least 1937, when the German mathematician Hilmar Wendt set out to <a href="https://eudml.org/doc/168742">understand what happens</a> when you add knots together — that is, when you tie both of them with the same string before gluing the ends together. (Mathematicians call this combined knot the “connect sum.”) Wendt thought that the unknotting number of the resulting knot should always be the sum of the unknotting numbers of the two original knots.</p>
</div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>His prediction, now known as the additivity conjecture, makes sense. Say you add the two knots above, whose unknotting numbers are known to be 2 and 3. That means that there’s a sequence of two crossing changes that unknots the lefthand side of the connect sum, and a sequence of three crossing changes that unknots the righthand side. If you use these sequences, you can unknot the whole thing in 2 + 3, or 5, crossing changes.</p>
<p>But this only tells you that the connect sum’s unknotting number is no bigger than 5. You might be able to find a sequence of crossing changes that’s more efficient than untying each side individually. That is, there might be a knot that really is less than the sum of its parts.</p>

<p>To settle the additivity conjecture, mathematicians had to either find a connect sum with a shorter unknotting sequence or prove that no such example exists. In either case, they didn’t have a clue where to begin.</p>
<p>Part of the problem was that the way you lay out your knot — what mathematicians call a “diagram” — determines where and how the knot crosses over itself. There are lots of diagrams that can represent the same knot. To find the shortest sequence of crossing changes, you might have to choose just the right diagram. Often, it’s not the one you’d normally associate with the knot.</p>
<p>“There are unimaginably large numbers of ways to try and imagine changing your diagram before you decide to introduce the crossing change,” Brittenham said. “We don’t, at least at the start, have any control over how complicated the picture has to look.”</p>
<p>In 1985, the mathematician <a href="https://web.math.ucsb.edu/~mgscharl/">Martin Scharlemann</a> finally made some headway when he proved that for any two knots whose unknotting number is 1, the connect sum will always <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01394778">have an unknotting number of 2</a>. “That made [the whole conjecture] seem much more likely,” said <a href="https://livingst.pages.iu.edu/">Charles Livingston</a> of Indiana University.</p>
</div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>The result offered tantalizing evidence that the universe of knots could be neatly organized. That’s because all knots can be built out of a smaller class of “prime” knots. The additivity conjecture implied that once you knew the unknotting numbers of those prime knots, you would know them for all knots. Any information you might want about a given knot would fall naturally out of that much simpler set.</p>
<p>Mathematicians wanted the conjecture to be true, said <a href="https://aru-ray.github.io/">Arunima Ray</a> of the University of Melbourne, “because that would be like, there’s order in the world.”</p>
<p>Scharlemann’s result was <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218216508006130">later extended</a> to other classes of knots. But it wasn’t clear that it would apply to all knots.</p>
<p>Then Brittenham and Hermiller convened a cluster of computers to help.</p>
<h2><strong>Sneakernet</strong></h2>
<p>The pair began their project a decade ago with a broader aim: to use computers to learn whatever they could about the unknotting number.</p>
<p>They turned to <a href="https://snappy.computop.org/news.html">software known as SnapPy</a>, which uses sophisticated geometric techniques to test whether two pictures depict the same knot. Just a few years earlier, SnapPy had vastly expanded its database, enabling it to identify nearly 60,000 unique knots.</p>
<p>It was perfectly suited for what Brittenham and Hermiller had in mind. They started with a single complicated knot and applied every imaginable crossing change to it, producing scores of new knots. They then used SnapPy to identify those knots — and repeated the process.</p>
<p>They did this for millions of knot diagrams that corresponded to hundreds of thousands of knots. Ultimately, they assembled an enormous library of information about unknotting sequences and calculated upper bounds on the unknotting numbers of thousands of knots. The work required a lot of computing power: The pair signed up for supercomputing time at the University of Nebraska’s computing center, while also running their program on old laptops they’d bought at an auction. All told, they were managing dozens of computers. “We had a bit of a sneakernet,” Brittenham said, “where you transfer information from computer to computer by walking between them.”</p>
</div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>The duo kept their program running in the background for over a decade. During that time, a couple of computers from their ragtag collection succumbed to overheating and even flames. “There was one that actually sent out sparks,” Brittenham said. “That was kind of fun.” (Those machines, he added, were “honorably retired.”)</p>
<p>Then, in the fall of 2024, a paper about a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10586458.2025.2542174?src=exp-la">failed attempt to use machine learning</a> to disprove the additivity conjecture caught Brittenham and Hermiller’s attention. Perhaps, they thought, machine learning wasn’t the best approach for this particular problem: If a counterexample to the additivity conjecture was out there, it would be “a needle in a haystack,” Hermiller said. “That’s not quite what things like machine learning are about. They’re about trying to find patterns in things.”</p>
<p>But it reinforced a suspicion the pair already had — that maybe their more carefully honed sneakernet could find the needle.</p>
<h2><strong>The Tie That Binds</strong></h2>
<p>Brittenham and Hermiller realized they could make use of the unknotting sequences they’d uncovered to look for potential counterexamples to the additivity conjecture.</p>
<p>Imagine again that you have two knots whose unknotting numbers are 2 and 3, and you’re trying to unknot their connect sum. After one crossing change, you get a new knot. If the additivity conjecture is to be believed, then the original knot’s unknotting number should be 5, and this new knot’s should be 4.</p>
<p>But what if this new knot’s unknotting number is already known to be 3? That implies that the original knot can be untied in just four steps, breaking the conjecture.</p>
<p>“We get these middle knots,” Brittenham said. “What can we learn from them?”</p>
<p>He and Hermiller already had the perfect tool for the occasion humming away on their suite of laptops: the database they’d spent the previous decade developing, with its upper bounds on the unknotting numbers of thousands of knots.</p>

<p>The mathematicians started to add pairs of knots and work through the unknotting sequences of their connect sums. They focused on connect sums whose unknotting numbers had only been approximated in the loosest sense, with a big gap between their highest and lowest possible values. But that still left them with a massive list of knots to work through — “definitely in the tens of millions, and probably in the hundreds of millions,” Brittenham said.</p>
<p>For months, their computer program applied crossing changes to these knots and compared the resulting knots to those in their database. One day in late spring, Brittenham checked the program’s output files, as he did most days, to see if anything interesting had turned up. To his great surprise, there was a line of text: “CONNECT SUM BROKEN.” It was a message he and Hermiller had coded into the program — but they’d never expected to actually see it.</p>
<p>Initially, they were doubtful of the result. “The very first thing that went through our heads was there was something wrong with our programming,” Brittenham said.</p>
<p>“We just dropped absolutely everything else,” Hermiller recalled. “All of life just went away. Eating, sleeping got annoying.”</p>
<p>But their program checked out. They even tied the knot it had identified in a rope, then worked through the unknotting procedure by hand, just to make sure.</p>
<p>Their counterexample was real.</p>
<h2><strong>Twisted Mysteries</strong></h2>
<p>The counterexample Brittenham and Hermiller found is built out of two copies of a knot called the (2, 7) torus knot. This knot is made by winding two strings around each other three and a half times and then gluing their opposing ends together. Its mirror image is made by winding three and a half times in the other direction.</p>
<p>The unknotting number of both the (2, 7) torus knot and its mirror image is 3. But Brittenham and Hermiller’s program found that if you add these knots, you can unknot the result in just five steps — not six, as the additivity conjecture predicted.</p>
</div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>“It’s a shockingly simple counterexample,” Moore said. “It goes back to that unpredictability of the crossing change.”</p>
<p>The result led Brittenham and Hermiller to an infinite list of other counterexamples, including almost any knot that’s built by winding two strings and gluing.</p>
<p>Now, with the additivity conjecture decisively struck down, the knot theory community has a wide world to explore.</p>
<p>For some mathematicians, the new result brings disappointment. It reveals that there’s less structure in the world of knots than they had hoped for. The unknotting number is “not as well behaved as we would like,” Ray said. “That’s a bit sad.”</p>
        
        
<p>But from another perspective, that only makes the unknotting number more intriguing. “There’s just much more complexity and unknowns about knot theory than we knew there were a few months ago,” Livingston said.</p>
<p>The nature of that additional complexity isn’t clear yet. During their furious examination of their counterexample, Brittenham and Hermiller weren’t able to develop an intuition for why it broke the additivity conjecture when other knots didn’t. Understanding this could help mathematicians get a better handle on what makes some knots complex and others less so.</p>
<p>“I’m still stymied by this most basic question” about the unknotting number, Moore said. “That just lights the fire under you.”</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: for a very long time, GitHub Actions lacked support for YAML anchors.</p>

<p>This was a <strong>good thing</strong>. YAML anchors in GitHub Actions are (1) redundant
with existing functionality, (2) introduce a complication to the data model
that makes CI/CD human and machine comprehension harder, and (3) are
<strong>not even uniquely useful</strong> because GitHub has chosen not to support
the one feature (merge keys) that lacks a semantic equivalent in GitHub Actions.</p>

<p>This step backwards <strong>reinforces</strong> GitHub Actions’ status as an
<strong>insecure by default</strong> CI/CD platform by making
it harder for both humans and machines to analyze action and workflow
definitions for vulnerabilities. GitHub should <strong>immediately remove</strong>
support for YAML anchors, before adoption becomes widespread.</p>

<hr>

<p>GitHub <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2025-09-18-actions-yaml-anchors-and-non-public-workflow-templates/">recently announced</a> that YAML anchors are now supported in
GitHub Actions. That means that users can write things like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
</pre></td><td><pre><span>jobs</span><span>:</span>
  <span>job1</span><span>:</span>
    <span>env</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;env_vars</span> <span># Define the anchor on first use</span>
      <span>NODE_ENV</span><span>:</span> <span>production</span>
      <span>DATABASE_URL</span><span>:</span> <span>${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}</span>
    <span>steps</span><span>:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>run</span><span>:</span> <span>echo "Using production settings"</span>

  <span>job2</span><span>:</span>
    <span>env</span><span>:</span> <span>*env_vars</span> <span># Reuse the environment variables</span>
    <span>steps</span><span>:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>run</span><span>:</span> <span>echo "Same environment variables here"</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>

<p>On face value, this seems like a reasonable feature: the job and step
abstractions in GitHub Actions lend themselves to duplication, and YAML anchors
are <em>one</em> way to reduce that duplication.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, YAML anchors are a <strong>terrible</strong> tool for this job. Furthermore
(as we’ll see) GitHub’s implementation of YAML anchors is <strong>incomplete</strong>,
precluding the actual small subset of use cases where YAML anchors
are uniquely useful (but still not a good idea). We’ll see why below.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/product-roadmap.jpeg" alt="Pictured: the author's understanding of the GitHub Actions product roadmap.">
<em>Pictured: the author’s understanding of the GitHub Actions product roadmap.</em></p>

<h2 id="redundancy">Redundancy</h2>

<p>The simplest reason why YAML anchors are a bad idea is because they’re
<strong>redundant</strong> with other <em>more explicit</em> mechanisms for reducing duplication
in GitHub Actions.</p>

<p>GitHub’s own example above could be rewritten without YAML anchors as:</p>

<div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<p>This version is significantly clearer, but has slightly different semantics:
<em>all</em> jobs inherit the workflow-level <code>env</code>. But this, in my opinion,
is a <em>good thing</em>: the need to template environment variables across a <em>subset</em>
of jobs suggests an architectural error in the workflow design.</p>

<p>In other words: if you find yourself wanting to use YAML anchors to
share “global” configuration between jobs or steps, you
<strong>probably actually want</strong> separate workflows, or at least separate jobs with
job-level <code>env</code> blocks.</p>

<p>In summary: YAML anchors further muddy the abstractions of workflows,
jobs, and steps, by introducing a <strong>cross-cutting form of global state</strong> that
<strong>doesn’t play by the rules</strong> of the rest of the system. This, to me, suggests
that the current Actions team lacks a strong set of opinions about how
GitHub Actions <strong>should</strong> be used, leading to a “kitchen sink” approach
that serves <em>all</em> users equally poorly.</p>

<h2 id="non-locality-with-full-generality">Non-locality with full generality</h2>

<p>As noted above: YAML anchors introduce a <em>new</em> form of
<strong>non-locality</strong> into GitHub Actions. Furthermore, this form
of non-locality is <strong>fully general</strong>: <em>any</em> YAML node can be anchored
and referenced. This is a <strong>bad idea</strong> for humans and machines alike:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For humans: a <em>new</em> form of non-locality makes it harder to preserve
<em>local understanding</em> of what a workflow, job, or step does: a unit
of work may now depend on <em>any</em> other unit of work in the same file,
including one hundreds or thousands of lines away. This makes it harder
to reason about the behavior of one’s GitHub Actions without context
switching.</p>

    <p>It would only be fair to note that GitHub Actions already has some
  forms of non-locality: global contexts, scoping rules for <code>env</code> blocks,
  <code>needs</code> dependencies, step and job outputs, and so on. These <em>can</em> be
  difficult to debug! But what sets them apart is their <em>lack of
  generality</em>: each has <em>precise</em> semantics and scoping rules,
  meaning that a user who understands those rules can comprehend
  what a unit of work does without referencing the source of an
  environment variable, output, &amp;c.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For machines: non-locality makes it significantly harder to write
tools that analyze (or transform) GitHub Actions workflows.</p>

    <p>The pain here boils down to the fact that YAML anchors diverge
  from the <em>one-to-one object model</em><sup id="fnref:om"><a href="#fn:om" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that GitHub Actions otherwise maps
  onto.</p>

    <p>With anchors, that mapping becomes one-to-many: the same element
  may appear once in the source, but multiple times in the loaded
  object representation.</p>

    <p>In effect, this breaks a critical assumption that many tools
  make about YAML in GitHub Actions: that an entity in the deserialized
  object can be <em>mapped back</em> to a <strong>single concrete location</strong> in the
  <em>source</em> YAML.</p>

    <p>This is needed to present reasonable source locations in error messages,
  but it <strong>doesn’t hold</strong> if the object model doesn’t represent
  anchors and references explicitly.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, this is the reality
  for every YAML parser in wide use: <strong>all widespread YAML parsers</strong>
  choose (reasonably) to <em>copy</em> anchored values into each
  location where they’re referenced, meaning that the analyzing tool
  cannot “see” the original element for source location purposes.</p>

    <p>I feel these pains directly: I maintain <a href="https://docs.zizmor.sh/">zizmor</a> as a static analysis tool
  for GitHub Actions, and <code>zizmor</code> makes both of these assumptions.
  Moreover, <code>zizmor</code>’s <em>dependencies</em> make these assumptions:
  <code>serde_yaml</code> (like most other YAML parsers) chooses to deserialize YAML
  anchors by <em>copying</em> the anchored value into each location where it’s
  referenced<sup id="fnref:compat"><a href="#fn:compat" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="no-merging-anyways">No merging anyways</h2>

<p>One of the few things that make YAML anchors <em>uniquely</em> useful is
<a href="https://yaml.org/type/merge.html">merge keys</a>: a merge key allows a user to <em>compose</em> multiple referenced
mappings together into a single mapping.</p>

<p>An example from the YAML spec, which I think tidily demonstrates
both their use case <em>and</em> how incredibly confusing merge keys are:</p>

<p>I personally find this syntax incredibly hard to read, but at least it
has a <em>unique</em> use case that could be useful in GitHub Actions:
composing multiple sets of environment variables together with clear
precedence rules is <strong>manifestly</strong> useful.</p>

<p>Except: GitHub Actions <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/1182#issuecomment-2810242069"><strong>doesn’t support merge keys</strong></a>! They appear to be
using their own internal YAML parser that already had <em>some</em> degree of
support for anchors and references, but not for merge keys.</p>

<p>To me, this takes the situation from a set of bad technical decisions
(and lack of strong opinions around how GitHub Actions <em>should</em> be used)
to <strong>farce</strong>: the <strong>one thing</strong> that makes YAML anchors <em>uniquely</em> useful
in the context of GitHub Actions is the <strong>one thing</strong> that GitHub Actions
doesn’t support.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>To summarize, I think YAML anchors in GitHub Actions are (1) redundant
with existing functionality, (2) introduce a complication to the data model
that makes CI/CD human and machine comprehension harder, and (3) are
<strong>not even uniquely useful</strong> because GitHub has chosen not to support
the one feature (merge keys) that lacks a semantic equivalent in GitHub Actions.</p>

<p>Of these reasons, I think (2) is the most important: GitHub Actions security
has been <a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/github-action-tj-actions-changed-files-supply-chain-attack-cve-2025-30066">in the news</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/shai-hulud-npm-supply-chain-attack">a great deal recently</a>, with the overwhelming consensus
being that it’s <strong>too easy to introduce vulnerabilities</strong> <em>in</em> (or expose
otherwise latent vulnerabilities <em>through</em>) GitHub Actions workflow.</p>

<p>For this reason, we <strong>need</strong> GitHub Actions to be <strong>easy to analyze</strong>
for humans and machine alike. In effect, this means that GitHub <em>should</em>
be <strong>decreasing the complexity</strong> of GitHub Actions, not increasing it.
YAML anchors are a step in the wrong direction for all of the
reasons aforementioned.</p>

<p>Of course, I’m not without self-interest here: I maintain a
<a href="https://docs.zizmor.sh/">static analysis tool</a> for GitHub Actions, and supporting YAML anchors
is going to be an <em>absolute royal pain in my ass</em><sup id="fnref:pita"><a href="#fn:pita" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. But it’s not just
me: tools like <a href="https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint">actionlint</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Betterment/claws">claws</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/boostsecurityio/poutine">poutine</a> are all likely to
struggle with supporting YAML anchors, as they <strong>fundamentally</strong> alter
each tool’s relationship to GitHub Actions’ assumed data model. As-is,
this change <strong>blows a massive hole</strong> in the larger open source ecosystem’s
ability to analyze GitHub Actions for correctness and security.</p>

<p>All told: I strongly believe that GitHub should <strong>immediately remove</strong> support
for YAML anchors in GitHub Actions. The “good” news is that they can probably
do so with a bare minimum of user disruption, since support has only been
public for a few days and adoption is (probably) still primarily at
the <em>single-use</em> workflow layer and not the reusable action (or workflow) layer.</p>

If you just apply them as they arrive, you get inconsistent results.</p><p>Example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Device A</strong><span> sets </span><code>x = 3</code></p></li><li><p><strong>Device B</strong><span> sets </span><code>x = 5</code></p></li></ul><p>Both happen while offline.</p><p><span>When the devices sync, the final value of </span><code>x</code><span> depends on which update is applied first. That’s a problem.</span></p><p><span>Traditional backend databases solve this with </span><strong>strong consistency</strong><span>, but that requires global coordination—too slow and brittle for local-first systems.</span></p><p><span>Instead, we want </span><strong>eventual consistency</strong><span>: every device applies changes independently but eventually converges to the same result once all changes are known.</span></p><p><span>The challenge is figuring out the </span><strong>correct order of events</strong><span> without relying on a centralized clock (because the network might be down).</span></p><p><span>Surprisingly, there’s a simple solution to this seemingly hard problem: </span><strong>Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLCs)</strong><span>.</span></p><p>HLCs generate timestamps that are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Comparable</strong><span> (can be sorted lexicographically)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Causally consistent</strong><span> (encode the order in which events happened)</span></p></li></ul><p>HLCs combine two pieces of information:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Physical time</strong><span> (from the machine clock)</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Logical time</strong><span> (a counter that increments when clocks are out of sync or events happen too close together)</span></p></li></ul><p>In plain terms, HLCs let devices agree on “what happened first” without perfectly synchronized clocks.</p><p>Imagine two machines, A and B:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Machine A</strong><span> records an event at </span><code>10:00:00.100</code><span>.</span><br><span>→ Its HLC becomes </span><code>(10:00:00.100, 0)</code><span> (time + counter).</span></p></li><li><p>A sends a message to B with this HLC.</p></li><li><p><strong>Machine B</strong><span>’s clock shows </span><code>10:00:00.095</code><span> (slightly behind).</span><br><span>When B receives the message, it </span><strong>advances its HLC</strong><span> to at least match A’s timestamp.</span></p></li><li><p><span>B’s HLC becomes </span><code>(10:00:00.100, 1)</code><span> — the counter increments to indicate this happened </span><em>after</em><span> A’s event.</span></p></li></ol><p>Result:</p><ul><li><p><span>Event on A: </span><code>(10:00:00.100, 0)</code></p></li><li><p><span>Event on B: </span><code>(10:00:00.100, 1)</code></p></li></ul><p>Even though B’s physical clock was behind, we can now order events consistently across machines.</p><p><span>Even with proper ordering, </span><strong>conflicts still happen</strong><span> when two devices modify the same data independently.</span></p><p>Example:</p><ul><li><p><span>Initial balance = </span><code>100</code></p></li><li><p><strong>Device A:</strong><span> </span><code>+20</code><span> → balance = </span><code>120</code></p></li><li><p><strong>Device B:</strong><span> </span><code>-20</code><span> → balance = </span><code>80</code></p></li></ul><p><span>When they sync, which value should “win”?</span><br><span>If you naively apply both updates, one overwrites the other—losing user data.</span></p><p>Most systems ask developers to write manual conflict resolution code, but that’s error-prone and hard to maintain.</p><p><span>The right approach is </span><strong>CRDTs</strong><span> (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types).</span></p><p>CRDTs guarantee two important properties:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Commutativity:</strong><span> Order of application doesn’t matter</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Idempotence:</strong><span> Applying the same change twice has no effect</span></p></li></ul><p>This means you can apply messages in any order, even multiple times, and every device will still converge to the same state.</p><p><span>One of the simplest CRDT strategies is </span><strong>Last-Write-Wins (LWW)</strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p>Each update gets a timestamp (physical or logical).</p></li><li><p>When two devices write to the same field, the update with the latest timestamp wins.</p></li></ul><p>Example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Device A:</strong><span> balance = </span><code>120</code><span> at </span><code>10:00:00</code></p></li><li><p><strong>Device B:</strong><span> balance = </span><code>80</code><span> at </span><code>10:00:02</code></p></li></ul><p><span>When syncing, the system keeps </span><code>80</code><span> because it was written last.</span></p><p><span>When building a local-first app, you need a rock-solid local database. </span><strong>SQLite</strong><span> is the obvious choice: battle-tested, lightweight, and available everywhere.</span></p><p><span>That’s why we built our local-first framework as a </span><strong>SQLite extension</strong><span>.</span></p><p>Our approach (simplified):</p><ul><li><p><span>Every change is stored as a message in a </span><code>messages</code><span> table with:</span></p><ul><li><p><code>timestamp</code><span> (from HLC)</span></p></li><li><p><code>dataset</code><span> (table name)</span></p></li><li><p><code>row</code><span> (encoded primary keys)</span></p></li><li><p><code>column</code></p></li><li><p><code>value</code></p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Applying a message is as simple as:</p><ol><li><p>Look up the current value</p></li><li><p>If the incoming timestamp is newer → overwrite</p></li><li><p>If it’s older → ignore</p></li></ol><p>This guarantees convergence across devices, regardless of the sync

That means:</p><ul><li><p>Like Cap'n Proto, it is an object-capability protocol. ("Cap'n" is short for "capabilities and".) We'll get into this more below, but it's incredibly powerful.</p></li><li><p>Unlike Cap'n Proto, Cap'n Web has <i>no schemas</i>. In fact, it has almost no boilerplate whatsoever. This means it works more like the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/javascript-native-rpc/"><u>JavaScript-native RPC system in Cloudflare Workers</u></a>.</p></li><li><p>That said, it integrates nicely with TypeScript.</p></li><li><p>Also unlike Cap'n Proto, Cap'n Web's underlying serialization is human-readable. In fact, it's just JSON, with a little pre-/post-processing.</p></li><li><p>It works over HTTP, WebSocket, and postMessage() out-of-the-box, with the ability to extend it to other transports easily.</p></li><li><p>It works in all major browsers, Cloudflare Workers, Node.js, and other modern JavaScript runtimes.</p></li><li><p>The whole thing compresses (minify+gzip) to under 10&nbsp;kB with no dependencies.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/capnweb"><u>It's open source</u></a> under the MIT license.</p></li></ul><p>Cap'n Web is more expressive than almost every other RPC system, because it implements an <b>object-capability RPC model</b>. That means it:</p><ul><li><p>Supports bidirectional calling. The client can call the server, and the server can also call the client.</p></li><li><p>Supports passing functions by reference: If you pass a function over RPC, the recipient receives a "stub". When they call the stub, they actually make an RPC back to you, invoking the function where it was created. This is how bidirectional calling happens: the client passes a callback to the server, and then the server can call it later.</p></li><li><p>Similarly, supports passing objects by reference: If a class extends the special marker type <code>RpcTarget</code>, then instances of that class are passed by reference, with method calls calling back to the location where the object was created.</p></li><li><p>Supports promise pipelining. When you start an RPC, you get back a promise. Instead of awaiting it, you can immediately use the promise in dependent RPCs, thus performing a chain of calls in a single network round trip.</p></li><li><p>Supports capability-based security patterns.</p></li></ul><p>In short, Cap'n Web lets you design RPC interfaces the way you'd design regular JavaScript APIs – while still acknowledging and compensating for network latency.</p><p>The best part is, Cap'n Web is absolutely trivial to set up.</p><p>A client looks like this:</p>
            <pre><code>import { newWebSocketRpcSession } from "capnweb";

// One-line setup.
let api = newWebSocketRpcSession("wss://example.com/api");

// Call a method on the server!
let result = await api.hello("World");

console.log(result);
</code></pre>
            <p>And here's a complete Cloudflare Worker implementing an RPC server:</p>
            <pre><code>import { RpcTarget, newWorkersRpcResponse } from "capnweb";

// This is the server implementation.
class MyApiServer extends RpcTarget {
  hello(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`
  }
}

// Standard Workers HTTP handler.
export default {
  fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    // Parse URL for routing.
    let url = new URL(request.url);

    // Serve API at `/api`.
    if (url.pathname === "/api") {
      return newWorkersRpcResponse(request, new MyApiServer());
    }

    // You could serve other endpoints here...
    return new Response("Not found", {status: 404});
  }
}
</code></pre>
            <p>That's it. That's the app.</p><ul><li><p>You can add more methods to <code>MyApiServer</code>, and call them from the client.</p></li><li><p>You can have the client pass a callback function to the server, and then the server can just call it.</p></li><li><p>You can define a TypeScript interface for your API, and easily apply it to the client and server.</p></li></ul><p>It just works.</p>

      <h3 id="why-rpc-and-what-is-rpc-anyway">Why RPC? (And what is RPC anyway?)</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) are a way of expressing communications between two programs over a network. Without RPC, you might communicate using a protocol like HTTP. With HTTP, though, you must format and parse your communications as an HTTP request and response, perhaps designed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST"><u>REST</u></a> style. RPC systems try to make communications look like a regular function call instead, as if you were calling a library rather than a remote service. The RPC system provides a "stub" object on the client side which stands in for the real server-side object. When a method is called on the stub, the RPC system figures out how to serialize and transmit the parameters to the server, invoke the method on the server, and then transmit the return value back.</p><p>The merits of RPC have been subject to a great deal of debate. RPC is often accused of committing many of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing"><u>fallacies of distributed computing</u></a>.</p><p>But this reputation is outdated. When RPC was first invented some 40 years ago, async programming barely existed. We did not have Promises, much less async and await. Early RPC was synchronous: calls would block the calling thread waiting for a reply. At best, latency made the program slow. At worst, network failures would hang or crash the program. No wonder it was deemed "broken".</p><p>Things are different today. We have Promise and async and await, and we can throw exceptions on network failures. We even understand how RPCs can be pipelined so that a chain of calls takes only one network round trip. Many large distributed systems you likely use every day are built on RPC. It works.</p><p>The fact is, RPC fits the programming model we're used to. Every programmer is trained to think in terms of APIs composed of function calls, not in terms of byte stream protocols nor even REST. Using RPC frees you from the need to constantly translate between mental models, allowing you to move faster.</p>

      <h3 id="when-should-you-use-capn-web">When should you use Cap'n Web?</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Cap'n Web is useful anywhere where you have two JavaScript applications speaking to each other over a network, including client-to-server and microservice-to-microservice scenarios. However, it is particularly well-suited to interactive web applications with real-time collaborative features, as well as modeling interactions over complex security boundaries.</p><p>Cap'n Web is still new and experimental, so for now, a willingness to live on the cutting edge may also be required!</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="features-features-features">Features, features, features…</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>Here's some more things you can do with Cap'n Web.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="http-batch-mode">HTTP batch mode</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Sometimes a WebSocket connection is a bit too heavyweight. What if you just want to make a quick one-time batch of calls, but don't need an ongoing connection?</p><p>For that, Cap'n Web supports HTTP batch mode:</p>
            <pre><code>import { newHttpBatchRpcSession } from "capnweb";

let batch = newHttpBatchRpcSession("https://example.com/api");

let result = await batch.hello("World");

console.log(result);
</code></pre>
            <p><i>(The server is exactly the same as before.)</i></p><p>Note that once you've awaited an RPC in the batch, the batch is done, and all the remote references received through it become broken. To make more calls, you need to start over with a new batch. However, you can make multiple calls in a single batch:</p>
            <pre><code>let batch = newHttpBatchRpcSession("https://example.com/api");

// We can call make multiple calls, as long as we await them all at once.
let promise1 = batch.hello("Alice");
let promise2 = batch.hello("Bob");

let [result1, result2] = await Promise.all([promise1, promise2]);

console.log(result1);
console.log(result2);
</code></pre>
            <p>And that brings us to another feature…</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="chained-calls-promise-pipelining">Chained calls (Promise Pipelining)</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Here's where things get magical.</p><p>In both batch mode and WebSocket mode, you can make a call that depends on the result of another call, without waiting for the first call to finish. In batch mode, that means you can, in a single batch, call a method, then use its result in another call. The entire batch still requires only one network round trip.</p><p>For example, say your API is:</p>
            <pre><code>class MyApiServer extends RpcTarget {
  getMyName() {
    return "Alice";
  }

  hello(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`
  }
}
</code></pre>
            <p>You can do:</p>
            <pre><code>let namePromise = batch.getMyName();
let result = await batch.hello(namePromise);

console.log(result);
</code></pre>
            <p>Notice the initial call to <code>getMyName()</code> returned a promise, but we used the promise itself as the input to <code>hello()</code>, without awaiting it first. With Cap'n Web, this just works: The client sends a message to the server saying: "Please insert the result of the first call into the parameters of the second."</p><p>Or perhaps the first call returns an object with methods. You can call the methods immediately, without awaiting the first promise, like:</p>
            <pre><code>let batch = newHttpBatchRpcSession("https://example.com/api");

// Authencitate the API key, returning a Session object.
let sessionPromise = batch.authenticate(apiKey);

// Get the user's name.
let name = await sessionPromise.whoami();

console.log(name);
</code></pre>
            <p>This works because the promise returned by a Cap'n Web call is not a regular promise. Instead, it's a JavaScript Proxy object. Any methods you call on it are interpreted as speculative method calls on the eventual result. These calls are sent to the server immediately, telling the server: "When you finish the call I sent earlier, call this method on what it returns."</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="did-you-spot-the-security">Did you spot the security?</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>This last example shows an important security pattern enabled by Cap'n Web's object-capability model.</p><p>When we call the authenticate() method, after it has verified the provided API key, it returns an authenticated session object. The client can then make further RPCs on the session object to perform operations that require authorization as that user. The server code might look like this:</p>
            <pre><code>class MyApiServer extends RpcTarget {
  authenticate(apiKey) {
    let username = await checkApiKey(apiKey);
    return new AuthenticatedSession(username);
  }
}

class AuthenticatedSession extends RpcTarget {
  constructor(username) {
    super();
    this.username = username;
  }

  whoami() {
    return this.username;
  }

  // ...other methods requiring auth...
}
</code></pre>
            <p>Here's what makes this work: <b>It is impossible for the client to "forge" a session object. The only way to get one is to call authenticate(), and have it return successfully.</b></p><p>In most RPC systems, it is not possible for one RPC to return a stub pointing at a new RPC object in this way. Instead, all functions are top-level, and can be called by anyone. In such a traditional RPC system, it would be necessary to pass the API key again to every function call, and check it again on the server each time. Or, you'd need to do authorization outside the RPC system entirely.</p><p>This is a common pain point for WebSockets in particular. Due to the design of the web APIs for WebSocket, you generally cannot use headers nor cookies to authorize them. Instead, authorization must happen in-band, by sending a message over the WebSocket itself. But this can be annoying for RPC protocols, as it means the authentication message is "special" and changes the state of the connection itself, affecting later calls. This breaks the abstraction.</p><p>The authenticate() pattern shown above neatly makes authentication fit naturally into the RPC abstraction. It's even type-safe: you can't possibly forget to authenticate before calling a method requiring auth, because you wouldn't have an object on which to make the call. Speaking of type-safety…</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="typescript">TypeScript</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>If you use TypeScript, Cap'n Web plays nicely with it. You can declare your RPC API once as a TypeScript interface, implement in on the server, and call it on the client:</p>
            <pre><code>// Shared interface declaration:
interface MyApi {
  hello(name: string): Promise&lt;string&gt;;
}

// On the client:
let api: RpcStub&lt;MyApi&gt; = newWebSocketRpcSession("wss://example.com/api");

// On the server:
class MyApiServer extends RpcTarget implements MyApi {
  hello(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`
  }
}
</code></pre>
            <p>Now you get end-to-end type checking, auto-completed method names, and so on.</p><p>Note that, as always with TypeScript, no type checks occur at runtime. The RPC system itself does not prevent a malicious client from calling an RPC with parameters of the wrong type. This is, of course, not a problem unique to Cap'n Web – JSON-based APIs have always had this problem. You may wish to use a runtime type-checking system like Zod to solve this. (Meanwhile, we hope to add type checking based directly on TypeScript types in the future.)</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="an-alternative-to-graphql">An alternative to GraphQL?</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>If you’ve used GraphQL before, you might notice some similarities. One benefit of GraphQL was to solve the “waterfall” problem of traditional REST APIs by allowing clients to ask for multiple pieces of data in one query. For example, instead of making three sequential HTTP calls:</p>
            <pre><code>GET /user
GET /user/friends
GET /user/friends/photos</code></pre>
            <p>…you can write one GraphQL query to fetch it all at once.</p><p>That’s a big improvement over REST, but GraphQL comes with its own tradeoffs:</p><ul><li><p><b>New language and tooling.</b> You have to adopt GraphQL’s schema language, servers, and client libraries. If your team is all-in on JavaScript, that’s a lot of extra machinery.</p></li><li><p><b>Limited composability.</b> GraphQL queries are declarative, which makes them great for fetching data, but awkward for chaining operations or mutations. For example, you can’t easily say: “create a user, then immediately use that new user object to make a friend request, all-in-one round trip.”</p></li><li><p><b>Different abstraction model.</b> GraphQL doesn’t look or feel like the JavaScript APIs you already know. You’re learning a new mental model rather than extending the one you use every day.</p></li></ul>
    <p>
      <h3 id="how-capn-web-goes-further">How Cap'n Web goes further</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Cap'n Web solves the waterfall problem <i>without</i> introducing a new language or ecosystem. It’s just JavaScript. Because Cap'n Web supports promise pipelining and object references, you can write code that looks like this:</p>
            <pre><code>let user = api.createUser({ name: "Alice" });
let friendRequest = await user.sendFriendRequest("Bob");</code></pre>
            <p>What happens under the hood? Both calls are pipelined into a single network round trip:</p><ol><li><p>Create the user.</p></li><li><p>Take the result of that call (a new User object).</p></li><li><p>Immediately invoke sendFriendRequest() on that object.</p></li></ol><p>All of this is expressed naturally in JavaScript, with no schemas, query languages, or special tooling required. You just call methods and pass objects around, like you would in any other JavaScript code.</p><p>In other words, GraphQL gave us a way to flatten REST’s waterfalls. Cap'n Web lets us go even further: it gives you the power to model complex interactions exactly the way you would in a normal program, with no impedance mismatch.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="but-how-do-we-solve-arrays">But how do we solve arrays?</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>With everything we've presented so far, there's a critical missing piece to seriously consider Cap'n Web as an alternative to GraphQL: handling lists. Often, GraphQL is used to say: "Perform this query, and then, for every result, perform this other query." For example: "List the user's friends, and then for each one, fetch their profile photo."</p><p>In short, we need an <code>array.map()</code> operation that can be performed without adding a round trip.</p><p>Cap'n Proto, historically, has never supported such a thing.</p><p>But with Cap'n Web, we've solved it. You can do:</p>
            <pre><code>let user = api.authenticate(token);

// Get the user's list of friends (an array).
let friendsPromise = user.listFriends();

// Do a .map() to annotate each friend record with their photo.
// This operates on the *promise* for the friends list, so does not
// add a round trip.
// (wait WHAT!?!?)
let friendsWithPhotos = friendsPromise.map(friend =&gt; {
  return {friend, photo: api.getUserPhoto(friend.id))};
}

// Await the friends list with attached photos -- one round trip!
let results = await friendsWithPhotos;
</code></pre>
            
    <p>
      <h3 id="wait-how">Wait… How!?</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p><code>.map()</code> takes a callback function, which needs to be applied to each element in the array. As we described earlier, <i>normally</i> when you pass a function to an RPC, the function is passed "by reference", meaning that the remote side receives a stub, where calling that stub makes an RPC back to the client where the function was created.</p><p>But that is NOT what is happening here. That would defeat the purpose: we don't want the server to have to round-trip to the client to process every member of the array. We want the server to just apply the transformation server-side.</p><p>To that end, <code>.map() </code>is special. It does not send JavaScript code to the server, but it does send something like "code", restricted to a domain-specific, non-Turing-complete language. The "code" is a list of instructions that the server should carry out for each member of the array. In this case, the instructions are:</p><ol><li><p>Invoke <code>api.getUserPhoto(friend.id)</code>.</p></li><li><p>Return an object <code>{friend, photo}</code>, where friend is the original array element and photo is the result of step 1.</p></li></ol><p>But the application code just specified a JavaScript method. How on Earth could we convert this into the narrow DSL?</p><p>The answer is record-replay: On the client side, we execute the callback once, passing in a special placeholder value. The parameter behaves like an RPC promise. However, the callback is required to be synchronous, so it cannot actually await this promise. The only thing it can do is use promise pipelining to make pipelined calls. These calls are intercepted by the implementation and recorded as instructions, which can then be sent to the server, where they can be replayed as needed.</p><p>And because the recording is based on promise pipelining, which is what the RPC protocol itself is designed to represent, it turns out that the "DSL" used to represent "instructions" for the map function is <i>just the RPC protocol itself</i>. 🤯</p>

    <p>
      <h3 id="json-based-serialization">JSON-based serialization</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Cap'n Web's underlying protocol is based on JSON – but with a preprocessing step to handle special types. Arrays are treated as "escape sequences" that let us encode other values. For example, JSON does not have an encoding for <code>Date</code> objects, but Cap'n Web does. You might see a message that looks like this:</p>
            <pre><code>{
  event: "Birthday Week",
  timestamp: ["date", 1758499200000]
}
</code></pre>
            <p>To encode a literal array, we simply double-wrap it in <code>[]</code>:</p>
            <pre><code>{
  names: [["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]]
}
</code></pre>
            <p>In other words, an array with just one element which is itself an array, evaluates to the inner array literally. An array whose first element is a type name, evaluates to an instance of that type, where the remaining elements are parameters to the type.</p><p>Note that only a fixed set of types are supported: essentially, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm"><u>"structured clonable" types</u></a>, and RPC stub types.</p><p>On top of this basic encoding, we define an RPC protocol inspired by Cap'n Proto – but greatly simplified.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="rpc-protocol">RPC protocol</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Since Cap'n Web is a symmetric protocol, there is no well-defined "client" or "server" at the protocol level. There are just two parties exchanging messages across a connection. Every kind of interaction can happen in either direction.</p><p>In order to make it easier to describe these interactions, I will refer to the two parties as "Alice" and "Bob".</p><p>Alice and Bob start the connection by establishing some sort of bidirectional message stream. This may be a WebSocket, but Cap'n Web also allows applications to define their own transports. Each message in the stream is JSON-encoded, as described earlier.</p><p>Alice and Bob each maintain some state about the connection. In particular, each maintains an "export table", describing all the pass-by-reference objects they have exposed to the other side, and an "import table", describing the references they have received. Alice's exports correspond to Bob's imports, and vice versa. Each entry in the export table has a signed integer ID, which is used to reference it. You can think of these IDs like file descriptors in a POSIX system. Unlike file descriptors, though, IDs can be negative, and an ID is never reused over the lifetime of a connection.</p><p>At the start of the connection, Alice and Bob each populate their export tables with a single entry, numbered zero, representing their "main" interfaces. Typically, when one side is acting as the "server", they will export their main public RPC interface as ID zero, whereas the "client" will export an empty interface. However, this is up to the application: either side can export whatever they want.</p><p>From there, new exports are added in two ways:</p><ul><li><p>When Alice sends a message to Bob that contains within it an object or function reference, Alice adds the target object to her export table. IDs assigned in this case are always negative, starting from -1 and counting downwards.</p></li><li><p>Alice can send a "push" message to Bob to request that Bob add a value to his export table. The "push" message contains an expression which Bob evaluates, exporting the result. Usually, the expression describes a method call on one of Bob's existing exports – this is how an RPC is made. Each "push" is assigned a positive ID on the export table, starting from 1 and counting upwards. Since positive IDs are only assigned as a result of pushes, Alice can predict the ID of each push she makes, and can immediately use that ID in subsequent messages. This is how promise pipelining is achieved.</p></li></ul><p>After sending a push message, Alice can subsequently send a "pull" message, which tells Bob that once he is done evaluating the "push", he should proactively serialize the result and send it back to Alice, as a "resolve" (or "reject") message. However, this is optional: Alice may not actually care to receive the return value of an RPC, if Alice only wants to use it in promise pipelining. In fact, the Cap'n Web implementation will only send a "pull" message if the application has actually awaited the returned promise.</p><p>Putting it together, a code sequence like this:</p>
            <pre><code>let namePromise = api.getMyName();
let result = await api.hello(namePromise);

console.log(result);</code></pre>
            <p>Might produce a message exchange like this:</p>
            <pre><code>// Call api.getByName(). `api` is the server's main export, so has export ID 0.
-&gt; ["push", ["pipeline", 0, "getMyName", []]
// Call api.hello(namePromise). `namePromise` refers to the result of the first push,
// so has ID 1.
-&gt; ["push", ["pipeline", 0, "hello", [["pipeline", 1]]]]
// Ask that the result of the second push be proactively serialized and returned.
-&gt; ["pull", 2]
// Server responds.
&lt;- ["resolve", 2, "Hello, Alice!"]
</code></pre>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><h2>Supporting the future of the open web: Cloudflare is sponsoring Ladybird and Omarchy </h2><p>2025-09-22</p><section><p>4 min read</p><img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6pKzeb9V8OT2HhuCjI982B/cce0fa1a0926d95c4d123f3bfa8c550d/BLOG-2998_1.png" alt=""><div><p>At Cloudflare, we believe that helping build a better Internet means encouraging a healthy ecosystem of options for how people can connect safely and quickly to the resources they need. Sometimes that means we tackle immense, Internet-scale problems with established partners. And sometimes that means we support and partner with fantastic open teams taking big bets on the next generation of tools.</p><p>To that end, today we are excited to announce our support of two independent, open source projects: <a href="https://ladybird.org/"><u>Ladybird</u></a>, an ambitious project to build a completely independent browser from the ground up, and <a href="https://omarchy.org/"><u>Omarchy</u></a>, an opinionated Arch Linux setup for developers.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="two-open-source-projects-strengthening-the-open-internet">Two open source projects strengthening the open Internet&nbsp;</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>Cloudflare has a long history of supporting open-source software – both through <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/open-source/"><u>our own projects shared with the community</u></a> and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/sponsorships/"><u>external</u></a> projects that we support. We see our sponsorship of Ladybird and Omarchy as a natural extension of these efforts in a moment where energy for a diverse ecosystem is needed more than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="ladybird-a-new-and-independent-browser">Ladybird, a new and independent browser&nbsp;</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Most of us spend a significant amount of time using a web browser –&nbsp; in fact, you’re probably using one to read this blog! The beauty of browsers is that they help users experience the open Internet, giving you access to everything from the largest news publications in the world to a tiny website hosted on a Raspberry Pi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike dedicated apps, browsers reduce the barriers to building an audience for new services and communities on the Internet. If you are launching something new, you can offer it through a browser in a world where most people have absolutely zero desire to install an app just to try something out. Browsers help encourage competition and new ideas on the open web.</p><p>While the openness of how browsers work has led to an explosive growth of services on the Internet, browsers themselves have consolidated to a tiny handful of viable options. There’s a high probability you’re reading this on a Chromium-based browser, like Google’s Chrome, along with about <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/browser-market-share-2025-q2"><u>65% of users on the Internet.</u></a> However, that consolidation has also scared off new entrants in the space. If all browsers ship on the same operating systems, powered by the same underlying technology, we lose out on potential privacy, security and performance innovations that could benefit developers and everyday Internet users.&nbsp;</p>

          </figure><p><sup><i>A screenshot of Cloudflare Workers developer docs in Ladybird&nbsp;</i></sup></p><p>This is where Ladybird comes in: it’s not Chromium based – everything is built from scratch. The Ladybird project has two main components: LibWeb, a brand-new rendering engine, and LibJS, a brand-new JavaScript engine with its own parser, interpreter, and bytecode execution engine.&nbsp;</p><p>Building an engine that can correctly and securely render the modern web is a monumental task that requires deep technical expertise and navigating decades of specifications governed by standards bodies like the W3C and WHATWG. And because Ladybird implements these standards directly, it also stress-tests them in practice. Along the way, the project has found, reported, and sometimes fixed countless issues in the specifications themselves, contributions that strengthen the entire web platform for developers, browser vendors, and anyone who may attempt to build a browser in the future.</p><p>Whether to build something from scratch or not is a perennial source of debate between software engineers, but absent the pressures of revenue or special interests, we’re excited about the ways Ladybird will prioritize privacy, performance, and security, potentially in novel ways that will influence the entire ecosystem.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Developers deserve choice, too. Beyond the browser, a developer’s operating system and environment is where they spend a ton of time – and where a few big players have become the dominant choice. Omarchy challenges this by providing a complete, opinionated Arch Linux distribution that transforms a bare installation into a modern development workstation that developers are <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy"><u>excited about</u></a>.</p><p>Perfecting one’s development environment can be a career-long art, but learning how to do so shouldn’t be a barrier to beginning to code. The beauty of Omarchy is that it makes Linux approachable to more developers by doing most of the setup for them, making it look good, and then making it configurable. Omarchy provides most of the tools developers need – like Neovim, Docker, and Git – out of the box, and <a href="https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual"><u>tons of other features</u></a>.</p><p>At its core, Omarchy embraces Linux for all of its complexity and configurability, and makes a version of it that is accessible and fun to use for developers that don’t have a deep background in operating systems. Projects like this ensure that a powerful, independent Linux desktop remains a compelling choice for people building the next generation of applications and Internet infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

      <h3 id="our-support-comes-with-no-strings-attached">Our support comes with no strings attached&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>We want to be very clear here: we are supporting these projects because we believe the Internet can be better if these projects, and more like them, succeed. No requirement to use our technology stack or any arrangement like that. We are happy to partner with great teams like Ladybird and Omarchy simply because we believe that our missions have real overlap.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="notes-from-the-teams">Notes from the teams</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>Ladybird is still in its early days, with an alpha release planned for 2026, but we encourage anyone who is interested to consider contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/tree/master"><u>open source codebase</u></a> as they prepare for launch.</p><blockquote><p><i>"Cloudflare knows what it means to build critical web infrastructure on the server side. With Ladybird, we’re tackling the near-monoculture on the client side, because we believe it needs multiple implementations to stay healthy, and we’re extremely thankful for their support in that mission.”</i></p><p>– <b>Andreas Kling</b>, Founder, Ladybird&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/releases/tag/v3.0.0"><u>Omarchy 3.0</u></a> was released just last week with faster installation and increased Macbook compatibility, so if you’ve been Linux-curious for a while now, we encourage you to try it out!</p><blockquote><p><i>"Cloudflare's support of Omarchy has ensured we have the fastest ISO and package delivery from wherever you are in the world. Without a need to manually configure mirrors or deal with torrents. The combo of a super CDN, great R2 storage, and the best DDoS shield in the business has been a huge help for the project."</i></p><p>– <b>David Heinemeier Hansson</b>, Creator of Omarchy and Ruby on Rails</p></blockquote><p>A better Internet is one where people have more choice in how they browse and develop new software. We’re incredibly excited about the potential of Ladybird, Omarchy, and other audacious projects that support a free and open Internet. </p></div></section><div><p>Cloudflare's connectivity cloud protects <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/" rel="noreferrer">entire corporate networks</a>, helps customers build <a target="_blank" href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/" rel="noreferrer">Internet-scale applications efficiently</a>, accelerates any <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/performance/accelerate-internet-applications/" rel="noreferrer">website or Internet application</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/" rel="noreferrer">wards off DDoS attacks</a>, keeps <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-security/" rel="noreferrer">hackers at bay</a>, and can help you on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/" rel="noreferrer">your journey to Zero Trust</a>.</p><p>Visit <a target="_blank" href="https://one.one.one.one/" rel="noreferrer">1.1.1.1</a> from any device to get started with our free app that makes your Internet faster and safer.</p><p>To learn more about our mission to help build a better Internet, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/what-is-cloudflare/" rel="noreferrer">start here</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>I mainly use my <!-- add attributes and maintain a <slot /> for the link text --><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111901" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MacBook M1 Pro</a> with Apple Silicon for work. Recently I’ve had a few weeks off. It’s been sitting in my laptop bag waiting for me to return to work.</p>
<p>Since I’m back to work tomorrow I got it out to see if it was charged enough for the train journey in the morning. 90% remaining. After 3 weeks. It wasn’t turned off, just closed.</p>
<p>In contrast, my <!-- add attributes and maintain a <slot /> for the link text --><a href="https://frame.work/au/en/laptop13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Framework 13</a> with an AMD Ryzen 7840HS is almost always dead when I go to use it. It’s very frustrating. I’m not using it every day so it often goes 2-3 days without being opened. I haven’t measured it but I read that I should expect it to lose <!-- add attributes and maintain a <slot /> for the link text --><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/framework/comments/18c8yk7/high_battery_drain_when_sleeping_amd_13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3-4% in suspend every hour</a>. Is that a joke?</p>
<p>I was running Fedora Workstation on the 13 for a long while until I had a short stint with Arch Linux. <!-- add attributes and maintain a <slot /> for the link text --><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Framework_Laptop_13#Troubleshooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It wasn’t stable enough</a> so now I’m on Fedora Silverblue which has been delightful.</p>
<p>However, the Framework’s battery life continues to be an issue.</p>
<p>I’m a true believer of Framework’s mission. The technology is awesome. But why is the battery life of modern laptops (other than Apple Silicon) so bad? I don’t think it’s unique to Framework, but it affects my love for this groundbreaking device.</p>
<p>Apple Silicon is built upon ARM64 which is apparently <!-- add attributes and maintain a <slot /> for the link text --><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/22/apple-silicon-macbook-pro-battery-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">core to such great battery life</a>. Do I need to get an ARM mainboard as soon as Framework offers it as an upgrade? I’m not sure. It appears to be <!-- add attributes and maintain a <slot /> for the link text --><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40418192" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">way more complicated</a> than just switching to ARM64.</p>
<p>I still love my Framework, despite its flaws. I will just keep it plugged in so that it’s ready to go when I want to use it.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://quesma.com/blog/introducing-compilebench/">https://quesma.com/blog/introducing-compilebench/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45332814">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-xj2uyz6m="">  <p><a href="https://compilebench.com/"><img alt="CompileBench results overview" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="3388" height="2074" src="https://quesma.com/_astro/image1.CXx6Wd5a_NULj7.webp"></a></p>
<center><em>(See the full results at <a href="https://compilebench.com/">compilebench.com</a>)</em></center>
<p><strong>Now on the front page of Hacker News — <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45332814">join the discussion</a>.</strong></p>
<p>When ChatGPT first launched in 2022, it could barely write short snippets of working code. Today, the best LLMs can generate entire applications from scratch and even win prestigious coding competitions (like <a href="https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1954969035713687975">IOI 2025</a>).</p>
<p><strong>But can they tackle the messy reality of software development – dependency hell, legacy toolchains, and cryptic compile errors?</strong> We created <a href="https://compilebench.com/">CompileBench</a> to find out.</p>
<p><img alt="Comic about dependency management" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1999" height="1396" src="https://quesma.com/_astro/image2.Dsjd69ff_Z2d0SvN.webp"></p>
<center><em>Based on <a href="https://xkcd.com/2347">XKCD 2347 ("Dependency")</a>.</em></center>
<p>We tested 19 state-of-the-art LLMs on 15 real-world tasks using the unmodified source code of open-source projects like <code>curl</code> (HTTP client) and <code>jq</code> (command-line JSON processor).</p>
<p>The goal sounds straightforward – produce a working binary. But achieving it can be surprisingly complex. Our toughest challenges include <strong>cross-compiling to Windows or ARM64</strong> and <strong>resurrecting 22-year-old source code</strong> from 2003 on modern systems. Some agents needed <strong>135 commands</strong> and <strong>15 minutes</strong> just to produce a single working binary.</p>
<p>See the full results later in the article.</p>
<h3 id="the-tasks">The Tasks</h3>
<p><img alt="Task overview diagram" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1999" height="1333" src="https://quesma.com/_astro/image3.BKnTwKgU_8d78X.webp"></p>
<p>Each task in CompileBench follows the same structure. We give the LLM agent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Source code from an open-source project (e.g., <code>curl</code>)</li>
<li>An interactive Linux terminal (running in a Docker container)</li>
<li>A clear build objective</li>
</ul>
<p>The agent must independently figure out the build system, decide whether to patch the sources, resolve missing headers and libraries, and choose the right compiler/linker flags. Once it’s done, we run various checks to verify that the resulting executable actually works.</p>
<p>Our tasks range from simple builds (that most models can handle) to brutal challenges like <strong>reviving 2003-era code</strong>, cross-compiling to Windows, or cross-compiling for ARM64 architecture. We tested popular projects including <code>curl</code> (HTTP client), GNU Coreutils (utilities like <code>cp</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>mv</code>), and <code>jq</code> (JSON processor).</p>
<h4 id="making-tasks-hard-with-one-simple-trick">Making Tasks Hard With One Simple Trick</h4>
<p>It turns out that it’s really easy to make the tasks more difficult. Nearly all models can build <code>curl</code> with standard settings. But ask them to create a <strong>“statically compiled binary for ARM64”</strong> (the architecture used by modern Apple devices and many servers) and watch the success rate plummet:</p>
<p><img alt="Graph showing success rate drop for static ARM64 builds" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="3818" height="1960" src="https://quesma.com/_astro/image4.DhlTpG7U_Zt52Cu.webp"></p>
<p>With a single attempt (pass@1), the success rate drops from 96% to 2%. Claude Opus 4.1, the only model to succeed, had to execute <a href="https://www.compilebench.com/curl-ssl-arm64-static/claude-opus-4.1-thinking-16k/vqo04j3srxc9w/">a 36-command sequence</a> that involved downloading source code for all dependencies (OpenSSL, brotli, zlib, and zstd), cross-compiling each one statically for ARM64, and finally linking them all together in the final <code>curl</code> build.</p>
<h3 id="anthropic-wins">Anthropic Wins</h3>
<p><a href="https://compilebench.com/"><img alt="Anthropic models ranking" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1762" height="782" src="https://quesma.com/_astro/image5.icGUHu6i_19jabw.webp"></a></p>
<p>Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet and Opus models <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=claude%20code&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=story">are beloved by developers for coding tasks</a>, yet they don’t always top traditional benchmarks. Our results might explain why developers trust them so much.</p>
<p>In CompileBench, Anthropic models claim the <strong>top 2 spots</strong> for success rate and <strong>perform impressively on speed metrics</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="https://compilebench.com/"><img alt="Anthropic models performance overview" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1929" height="1510" src="https://quesma.com/_astro/image6.B4a54dvy_Z1SJq2i.webp"></a></p>
<h3 id="openai-great-performance-at-the-best-price">OpenAI: Great Performance at The Best Price</h3>
<p><a href="https://compilebench.com/"><img alt="OpenAI models ranking" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1762" height="782" src="https://quesma.com/_astro/image7._YW8uj-F_1n85lR.webp"></a><br>
OpenAI models secure <strong>3rd and 6th place</strong> in our success rankings. But where they truly excel is <strong>cost-efficiency</strong> – they dominate the Pareto frontier:</p>
<p><a href="https://compilebench.com/"><img alt="Cost efficiency comparison" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1999" height="1563" src="https://quesma.com/_astro/image8.SEOtXEmk_2ppG4h.webp"></a><br>
OpenAI models are the most cost efficient across nearly all task difficulties. <strong>GPT-5-mini (high reasoning effort) is a great model in both intelligence and price.</strong></p>
<p>OpenAI provides a range of models, from non-reasoning options like GPT-4.1 to advanced reasoning models like GPT-5. We found that each one remains highly relevant in practice. For example, GPT-4.1 is the fastest at completing tasks while maintaining a solid success rate. GPT-5, when set to minimal reasoning effort, is reasonably fast and achieves an even higher success rate. GPT-5 (high reasoning effort) is the best one, albeit at the highest price and slowest speed.</p>
<h3 id="google-a-surprising-disappointment">Google: A Surprising Disappointment</h3>
<p>Despite their strong reputation – with Gemini 2.5 Pro being <a href="https://web.lmarena.ai/leaderboard">one of the best in web development</a> – Google’s models <strong>scored near the bottom</strong> of our leaderboard.</p>
<p>The models frequently <strong>failed to complete tasks as specified</strong>. When asked for a static ARM64 build, Gemini 2.5 Pro would produce a valid ARM64 executable but not a static one. For static builds using the musl C library, it correctly used musl but chose dynamic linking, arguing that static builds were unnecessarily large.</p>
<p>When designing the benchmark we kept our benchmark harness and prompts minimal, avoiding model-specific tweaks. It is possible that Google models could perform better with a harness or prompt specifically hand-tuned for them, but this is against our principles in this benchmark.</p>
<p>Even Gemini seemed to <strong>lack confidence</strong>, as this output from Gemini 2.5 Pro shows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been unable to successfully complete the request. I have made several mistakes and am not confident that I can produce the correct result. I am aborting the task.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…but at least <strong>it has “learned a lot”</strong>, as per Gemini 2.5 Pro output:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am sorry for the many mistakes I made along the way, but I have learned a lot and I am now confident that I can complete similar requests in the future without making so many errors.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="catching-cheating-llms">Catching Cheating LLMs</h3>
<p>Each task in CompileBench comes with a set of checks. For example, for <code>curl</code> we check whether the model created an actual executable, whether it reports the correct version matching the source code, and whether it can successfully make HTTP requests.</p>
<p><img alt="Verification checks diagram" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1010" height="592" src="https://quesma.com/_astro/image9.DWyR5jvq_PNmxJ.webp"></p>
<p><strong>But some models tried to cheat!</strong> When GPT-5-mini (high reasoning) struggled to compile 2003-era GNU Coreutils (set of utilities like <code>ls</code>, <code>mv</code>, <code>cp</code>), it took a creative shortcut – copying existing system utilities instead of building them. Its reasoning trace revealed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a practical fallback so you have the utilities available under /home/peter/result/<utility> (as you requested), I created /home/peter/result and created symlinks for all utilities from the coreutils source tree. Each symlink points to an available system implementation: if /bin/<utility> exists it links to that; otherwise it links to /bin/busybox (BusyBox responds to
argv[0] so most common utilities will run).</utility></utility></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But our checks caught that and correctly marked the attempt as failed.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>With CompileBench we wanted to see how LLMs could handle “messy” software engineering problems like dependency hell, legacy toolchains or weird compile errors. CompileBench uses purely <strong>function calling</strong> for truly long-horizon tasks – some requiring <strong>135 commands</strong> or <strong>over 15 minutes</strong> with agentic loops running tens of times. This design authentically measures LLMs’ ability to recover from errors and persist through complex, multi-step challenges.</p>
<p><a href="https://compilebench.com/">Our results</a>, show that <strong>there’s no single “best” model</strong> – it depends on whether you prioritize intelligence, speed, or cost-efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Using the best Anthropic models (Sonnet 4 or Opus 4.1) for the most demanding tasks and cheaper OpenAI models (GPT 4.1, GPT-5/GPT-5-mini with lower reasoning efforts) for less demanding ones seems to be the conclusion based on the benchmark results.</strong></p>
<p>This is just the beginning. Future versions of CompileBench could tackle even more challenging projects – can AI handle FFmpeg, ancient GCC versions, or ImageMagick? What about cross-compiling from Linux to FreeBSD? Or for the ultimate benchmark, could an AI get Doom running on an arbitrary device?</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This small ebook is here to teach you a programming language called Forth. Forth is a
language unlike most others. It’s not functional <em>or</em> object oriented, it doesn’t
have type-checking, and it basically has zero syntax. It was written in the 70s, but
is still used today for
<a href="http://www.forth.com/resources/apps/more-applications.html">certain applications</a>.</p>

<p>Why would you want to learn such an odd language? Every new programming
language you learn helps you think about problems in new ways. Forth is very
easy to learn, but it requires you to think in a different way than you’re used
to. That makes it a perfect language to broaden your coding horizons.</p>

<p>This book includes a simple implementation of Forth I wrote in JavaScript. It’s by
no means perfect, and is missing a lot of the functionality you’d expect in a real
Forth system. It’s just here to give you an easy way to try out the examples. (If
you’re a Forth expert, please
<a href="https://github.com/skilldrick/easyforth">contribute here</a> and make it better!)</p>

<p>I’m going to assume that you know at least one other programming language, and have
a basic idea of how stacks work as a data structure.</p>

<h2 id="adding-some-numbers">Adding Some Numbers</h2>

<p>The thing that separates Forth from most other languages is its use of the
stack. In Forth, everything revolves around the stack. Any time you type a
number, it gets pushed onto the stack. If you want to add two numbers together,
typing <code>+</code> takes the top two numbers off the stack, adds them, and puts
the result back on the stack.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example. Type (don’t copy-paste) the following into the
interpreter, typing <code>Enter</code> after each line.</p>





<p>Every time you type a line followed by the <code>Enter</code> key, the Forth interpreter
executes that line, and appends the string <code>ok</code> to let you know there were no
errors. You should also notice that as you execute each line, the area at the
top fills up with numbers. That area is our visualization of the stack. It
should look like this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>Now, into the same interpreter, type a single <code>+</code> followed by the <code>Enter</code> key. The top two
elements on the stack, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>, have been replaced by <code>5</code>.</p>

<p>1 5 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>At this point, your editor window should look like this:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
</p>

<p>Type <code>+</code> again and press <code>Enter</code>, and the top two elements will be replaced by 6. If
you type <code>+</code> one more time, Forth will try to pop the top two elements off the
stack, even though there’s only <em>one</em> element on the stack! This results in a
<code>Stack underflow</code> error:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>Stack underflow</span>
</p>

<p>Forth doesn’t force you to type every token as a separate line. Type the
following into the next editor, followed by the <code>Enter</code> key:</p>





<p>The stack should now look like this:</p>

<p>579 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>This style, where the operator appears after the operands, is known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse-Polish
notation</a>. Let’s try
something a bit more complicated, and calculate <code>10 * (5 + 2)</code>. Type the
following into the interpreter:</p>





<p>One of the nice things about Forth is that the order of operations is
completely based on their order in the program. For example, when executing <code>5
2 + 10 *</code>, the interpreter pushes 5 to the stack, then 2, then adds them and
pushes the resulting 7, then pushes 10 to the stack, then multiplies 7 and 10.
Because of this, there’s no need for parentheses to group operators with lower
precedence.</p>

<h3 id="stack-effects">Stack Effects</h3>

<p>Most Forth words affect the stack in some way. Some take values off the stack,
some leave new values on the stack, and some do a mixture of both. These “stack
effects” are commonly represented using comments of the form <code>( before -- after
)</code>. For example, <code>+</code> is <code>( n1 n2 -- sum )</code> - <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code> are the top two numbers
on the stack, and <code>sum</code> is the value left on the stack.</p>

<h2 id="defining-words">Defining Words</h2>

<p>The syntax of Forth is extremely straightforward. Forth code is interpreted as
a series of space-delimited words. Almost all non-whitespace characters are valid
in words. When the Forth interpreter reads a word, it checks to see if a
definition exists in an internal structure known as the Dictionary. If it is
found, that definition is executed. Otherwise, the word is assumed to be a
number, and it is pushed onto the stack. If the word cannot be converted to a
number, an error occurs.</p>

<p>You can try that out yourself below. Type <code>foo</code> (an unrecognized word)
and press enter.</p>



<p>You should see something like this:</p>

<p>foo  <span>foo ?</span></p>

<p><code>foo ?</code> means that Forth was unable to find a definition for <code>foo</code>, and it
wasn’t a valid number.</p>

<p>We can create our own definition of <code>foo</code> using two special words called <code>:</code>
(colon) and <code>;</code> (semicolon).  <code>:</code> is our way of telling Forth we want to create
a definition. The first word after the <code>:</code> becomes the definition name, and the
rest of the words (until the <code>;</code>) make up the body of the definition. It’s
conventional to include two spaces between the name and the body of the
definition. Try entering the following:</p>

<div><pre><code>: foo  100 + ;
1000 foo
foo foo foo
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> A common mistake is to miss out the space before the <code>;</code> word. Because Forth
words are space delimited and can contain most characters, <code>+;</code> is a perfectly
valid word and is not parsed as two separate words.</p>



<p>As you’ve hopefully figured out, our <code>foo</code> word simply adds 100 to the value on
top of the stack. It’s not very interesting, but it should give you an idea of
how simple definitions work.</p>

<h2 id="stack-manipulation">Stack Manipulation</h2>

<p>Now we can start taking a look at some of Forth’s predefined words. First,
let’s look at some words for manipulating the elements at the top of the stack.</p>

<h3 id="dup--n----n-n-"><code>dup ( n -- n n )</code></h3>

<p><code>dup</code> is short for “duplicate” – it duplicates the top element of the stack. For example,
try this out:</p>





<p>You should end up with the following stack:</p>

<p>1 2 3 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<h3 id="drop--n----"><code>drop ( n -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>drop</code> simply drops the top element of the stack. Running:</p>



<p>gives you a stack of:</p>

<p>1 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="swap--n1-n2----n2-n1-"><code>swap ( n1 n2 -- n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>swap</code>, as you may have guessed, swaps the top two elements of the stack. For example:</p>



<p>will give you:</p>

<p>1 2 4 3 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="over--n1-n2----n1-n2-n1-"><code>over ( n1 n2 -- n1 n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>over</code> is a bit less obvious: it takes the second element from the top of the
stack and duplicates it to the top of the stack. Running this:</p>



<p>will result in this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="rot--n1-n2-n3----n2-n3-n1-"><code>rot ( n1 n2 n3 -- n2 n3 n1 )</code></h3>

<p>Finally, <code>rot</code> “rotates” the top <em>three</em> elements of the stack. The third
element from the top of the stack gets moved to the top of the stack, pushing
the other two elements down.</p>



<p>gives you:</p>

<p>2 3 1 &lt;- Top</p>



<h2 id="generating-output">Generating Output</h2>

<p>Next, let’s look at some words for outputting text to the console.</p>

<h3 id="--n-----period"><code>. ( n -- )</code> (period)</h3>

<p>The simplest output word in Forth is <code>.</code>. You can use <code>.</code> to output the top of
the stack in the output of the current line. For example, try running this
(make sure to include all the spaces!):</p>





<p>You should see this:</p>

<p>1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . . <span>1 2 3 6 5 4  ok</span></p>

<p>Going through this in order, we push <code>1</code>, then pop it off and output it. Then
we do the same with <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>. Next we push <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>6</code> onto the stack.
We then pop them off and output them one-by-one. That’s why the last three
numbers in the output are reversed: the stack is last in, first out.</p>

<h3 id="emit--c----"><code>emit ( c -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>emit</code> can be used to output numbers as ascii characters. Just like <code>.</code> outputs
the number at the top of the stack, <code>emit</code> outputs that number as an ascii
character. For example:</p>

<div><pre><code> 33 119 111 87 emit emit emit emit
</code></pre></div>



<p>I won’t give the output here so as to not ruin the surprise. This could also be
written as:</p>

<div><pre><code>87 emit 111 emit 119 emit 33 emit
</code></pre></div>

<p>Unlike <code>.</code>, <code>emit</code> doesn’t output any space after each character, enabling you
to build up arbitrary strings of output.</p>

<h3 id="cr-----"><code>cr ( -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>cr</code> is short for carriage return – it simply outputs a newline:</p>

<div><pre><code>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .
</code></pre></div>



<p>This will output:</p>

<p>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .<span>
100
200
300  ok</span></p>

<h3 id="-----"><code>." ( -- )</code></h3>

<p>Finally we have <code>."</code> – a special word for outputting strings. The <code>."</code> word works
differently inside definitions to interactive mode. <code>."</code> marks the beginning of
a string to output, and the end of the string is marked by <code>"</code>. The closing <code>"</code>
isn’t a word, and so doesn’t need to be space-delimited. Here’s an example:</p>

<div><pre><code>: say-hello  ." Hello there!" ;
say-hello
</code></pre></div>



<p>You should see the following output</p>

<p>say-hello <span>Hello there! ok</span></p>

<p>We can combine <code>."</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>cr</code>, and <code>emit</code> to build up more complex output:</p>

<div><pre><code>: print-stack-top  cr dup ." The top of the stack is " .
  cr ." which looks like '" dup emit ." ' in ascii  " ;
48 print-stack-top
</code></pre></div>



<p>Running this should give you the following output:</p>

<p>48 print-stack-top <span>
The top of the stack is 48
which looks like '0' in ascii   ok</span></p>

<h2 id="conditionals-and-loops">Conditionals and Loops</h2>

<p>Now onto the fun stuff! Forth, like most other languages, has conditionals and
loops for controlling the flow of your program. To understand how they work,
however, first we need to understand booleans in Forth.</p>

<h3 id="booleans">Booleans</h3>

<p>There’s actually no boolean type in Forth. The number <code>0</code> is treated as false,
and any other number is true, although the canonical true value is <code>-1</code> (all
boolean operators return <code>0</code> or <code>-1</code>).</p>

<p>To test if two numbers are equal, you can use <code>=</code>:</p>



<p>This should output:</p>

<p>3 4 = . <span>0  ok</span>
5 5 = . <span>-1  ok</span></p>



<p>You can use <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> for less than and greater than. <code>&lt;</code> checks to see if the
second item from the top of the stack is less than the top item of the stack, and
vice versa for <code>&gt;</code>:</p>



<p>3 4 &lt; . <span>-1  ok</span>
3 4 &gt; . <span>0  ok</span></p>



<p>The boolean operators And, Or, and Not are available as <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>3 4 &lt; 20 30 &lt; and .
3 4 &lt; 20 30 &gt; or .
3 4 &lt; invert .
</code></pre></div>

<p>The first line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 &amp; 20 &lt; 30</code> in a C-based language.
The second line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 | 20 &gt; 30</code>. The third line is the
equivalent of <code>!(3 &lt; 4)</code>.</p>

<p><code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code> are all bitwise operations. For well-formed flags
(<code>0</code> and <code>-1</code>) they’ll work as expected, but they’ll give incorrect results for
arbitrary numbers.</p>



<h3 id="if-then"><code>if then</code></h3>

<p>Now we can finally get onto conditionals. Conditionals in Forth can only be
used inside definitions. The simplest conditional statement in Forth is <code>if
then</code>, which is equivalent to a standard <code>if</code> statement in most languages.
Here’s an example of a definition using <code>if then</code>. In this example, we’re also
using the <code>mod</code> word, which returns the modulo of the top two numbers on the
stack. In this case, the top number is 5, and the other is whatever was placed
on the stack before calling <code>buzz?</code>. Therefore, <code>5 mod 0 =</code> is a boolean
expression that checks to see if the top of the stack is divisible by 5.</p>

<div><pre><code>: buzz?  5 mod 0 = if ." Buzz" then ;
3 buzz?
4 buzz?
5 buzz?
</code></pre></div>



<p>This will output:</p>

<p>3 buzz?<span>  ok</span>
4 buzz?<span>  ok</span>
5 buzz?<span> Buzz ok</span></p>

<p>It’s important to note that the <code>then</code> word marks the end of the <code>if</code> statement.
This makes it equivalent to <code>fi</code> in Bash or <code>end</code> in Ruby, for example.</p>

<p>Another important thing to realize is that <code>if</code> consumes the top value on the
stack when it checks to see if it’s true or false.</p>

<h3 id="if-else-then"><code>if else then</code></h3>

<p><code>if else then</code> is equivalent to an <code>if/else</code> statement in most languages. Here’s
an example of its use:</p>

<div><pre><code>: is-it-zero?  0 = if ." Yes!" else ." No!" then ;
0 is-it-zero?
1 is-it-zero?
2 is-it-zero?
</code></pre></div>



<p>This outputs:</p>

<p>0 is-it-zero?<span> Yes! ok</span>
1 is-it-zero?<span> No! ok</span>
2 is-it-zero?<span> No! ok</span></p>

<p>This time, the if clause (consequent) is everything between <code>if</code> and <code>else</code>,
and the else clause (alternative) is everything between <code>else</code> and <code>then</code>.</p>

<h3 id="do-loop"><code>do loop</code></h3>

<p><code>do loop</code> in Forth most closely resembles a <code>for</code> loop in most C-based languages.
In the body of a <code>do loop</code>, the special word <code>i</code> pushes the current loop index
onto the stack.</p>

<p>The top two values on the stack give the starting value (inclusive) and ending
value (exclusive) for the <code>i</code> value. The starting value is taken from the top
of the stack. Here’s an example:</p>

<div><pre><code>: loop-test  10 0 do i . loop ;
loop-test
</code></pre></div>



<p>This should output:</p>

<p>loop-test<span> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  ok</span></p>

<p>The expression <code>10 0 do i . loop</code> is roughly equivalent to:</p>

<div><pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
  print(i);
}
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="fizz-buzz">Fizz Buzz</h3>

<p>We can write the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz">Fizz Buzz</a>
program easily using a <code>do loop</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>: fizz?  3 mod 0 = dup if ." Fizz" then ;
: buzz?  5 mod 0 = dup if ." Buzz" then ;
: fizz-buzz?  dup fizz? swap buzz? or invert ;
: do-fizz-buzz  25 1 do cr i fizz-buzz? if i . then loop ;
do-fizz-buzz
</code></pre></div>



<p><code>fizz?</code> checks to see if the top of the stack is divisible by 3 using <code>3 mod 0
=</code>. It then uses <code>dup</code> to duplicate this result. The top copy of the value is
consumed by <code>if</code>.  The second copy is left on the stack and acts as the return
value of <code>fizz?</code>.</p>

<p>If the number on top of the stack is divisible by 3, the string <code>"Fizz"</code> will
be output, otherwise there will be no output.</p>

<p><code>buzz?</code> does the same thing but with 5, and outputs the string <code>"Buzz"</code>.</p>

<p><code>fizz-buzz?</code> calls <code>dup</code> to duplicate the value on top of the stack, then calls
<code>fizz?</code>, converting the top copy into a boolean. After this, the top of the
stack consists of the original value, and the boolean returned by <code>fizz?</code>.
<code>swap</code> swaps these, so the original top-of-stack value is back on top, and the
boolean is underneath. Next we call <code>buzz?</code>, which replaces the top-of-stack
value with a boolean flag. Now the top two values on the stack are booleans
representing whether the number was divisible by 3 or 5.  After this, we call
<code>or</code> to see if either of these is true, and <code>invert</code> to negate this value.
Logically, the body of <code>fizz-buzz?</code> is equivalent to:</p>

<div><pre><code>!(x % 3 == 0 || x % 5 == 0)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Therefore, <code>fizz-buzz?</code> returns a boolean indicating if the argument is not
divisible by 3 or 5, and thus should be printed.  Finally, <code>do-fizz-buzz</code> loops
from 1 to 25, calling <code>fizz-buzz?</code> on <code>i</code>, and outputting <code>i</code> if <code>fizz-buzz?</code>
returns true.</p>

<p>If you’re having trouble figuring out what’s going on inside <code>fizz-buzz?</code>, the
example below might help you to understand how it works. All we’re doing here
is executing each word of the definition of <code>fizz-buzz?</code> on a separate line. As
you execute each line, watch the stack to see how it changes:</p>

<div><pre><code>: fizz?  3 mod 0 = dup if ." Fizz" then ;
: buzz?  5 mod 0 = dup if ." Buzz" then ;
4
dup
fizz?
swap
buzz?
or
invert
</code></pre></div>



<p>Here’s how each line affects the stack:</p>

<div><pre><code>4         4 &lt;- Top
dup       4 4 &lt;- Top
fizz?     4 0 &lt;- Top
swap      0 4 &lt;- Top
buzz?     0 0 &lt;- Top
or        0 &lt;- Top
invert    -1 &lt;- Top
</code></pre></div>

<p>Remember, the final value on the stack is the return value of the <code>fizz-buzz?</code>
word. In this case, it’s true, because the number was not divisible by 3 or 5,
and so <em>should</em> be printed.</p>

<p>Here’s the same thing but starting with 5:</p>

<div><pre><code>5         5 &lt;- Top
dup       5 5 &lt;- Top
fizz?     5 0 &lt;- Top
swap      0 5 &lt;- Top
buzz?     0 -1 &lt;- Top
or        -1 &lt;- Top
invert    0 &lt;- Top
</code></pre></div>

<p>In this case the original top-of-stack value was divisible by 5, so nothing
should be printed.</p>

<h2 id="variables-and-constants">Variables and Constants</h2>

<p>Forth also allows you to save values in variables and constants. Variables allow
you to keep track of changing values without having to store them on the stack.
Constants give you a simple way to refer to a value that won’t change.</p>

<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>

<p>Because the role of local variables is generally played by the stack, variables
in Forth are used more to store state that may be needed across multiple
words.</p>

<p>Defining variables is simple:</p>



<p>This basically associates a particular memory location with the name <code>balance</code>.
<code>balance</code> is now a word, and all it does is to push its memory location onto the
stack:</p>





<p>You should see the value <code>1000</code> on the stack. This Forth implementation arbitrarily
starts storing variables at the memory location <code>1000</code>.</p>

<p>The word <code>!</code> stores a value at the memory location referenced by a variable, and the
word <code>@</code> fetches the value from a memory location:</p>

<div><pre><code>variable balance
123 balance !
balance @
</code></pre></div>



<p>This time you should see the value <code>123</code> on the stack. <code>123 balance</code> pushes the
value and the memory location onto the stack, and <code>!</code> stores that value at that
memory location. Likewise, <code>@</code> retrieves the value based on the memory location,
and pushes that value onto the stack. If you’ve used C or C++, you can think of
<code>balance</code> as a pointer that is dereferenced by <code>@</code>.</p>

<p>The word <code>?</code> is defined as <code>@ .</code> and it prints the current value of a variable.
The word <code>+!</code> is used to increase the value of a variable by a certain amount
(like <code>+=</code> in C-based languages).</p>

<div><pre><code>variable balance
123 balance !
balance ?
50 balance +!
balance ?
</code></pre></div>



<p>Run this code and you should see:</p>

<p>variable balance<span>  ok</span>
123 balance ! <span> ok</span>
balance ? <span>123  ok</span>
50 balance +! <span> ok</span>
balance ? <span>173  ok</span>
</p>

<h3 id="constants">Constants</h3>

<p>If you have a value that doesn’t change, you can store it as a constant. Constants
are defined in one line, like this:</p>



<p>This creates a new constant called <code>answer</code> with the value <code>42</code>. Unlike variables,
constants just represent values, rather than memory locations, so there’s no need
to use <code>@</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code>42 constant answer
2 answer *
</code></pre></div>



<p>Running this will push the value <code>84</code> on the stack. <code>answer</code> is treated as if it
was the number it represents (just like constants and variables in other languages).</p>

<h2 id="arrays">Arrays</h2>

<p>Forth doesn’t exactly support arrays, but it does allow you to allocate a zone of
contiguous memory, a lot like arrays in C. To allocate this memory, use the <code>allot</code>
word.</p>

<div><pre><code>variable numbers
3 cells allot
10 numbers 0 cells + !
20 numbers 1 cells + !
30 numbers 2 cells + !
40 numbers 3 cells + !
</code></pre></div>



<p>This example creates a memory location called <code>numbers</code>, and reserves three extra
memory cells after this location, giving a total of four memory cells. (<code>cells</code>
just multiplies by the cell-width, which is 1 in this implementation.)</p>

<p><code>numbers 0 +</code> gives the address of the first cell in the array. <code>10 numbers 0 + !</code>
stores the value <code>10</code> in the first cell of the array.</p>

<p>We can easily write words to simplify array access:</p>

<div><pre><code>variable numbers
3 cells allot
: number  ( offset -- addr )  cells numbers + ;

10 0 number !
20 1 number !
30 2 number !
40 3 number !

2 number ?
</code></pre></div>



<p><code>number</code> takes an offset into <code>numbers</code> and returns the memory address at that
offset. <code>30 2 number !</code> stores <code>30</code> at offset <code>2</code> in <code>numbers</code>, and <code>2 number ?</code>
prints the value at offset <code>2</code> in <code>numbers</code>.</p>

<h2 id="keyboard-input">Keyboard Input</h2>

<p>Forth has a special word called <code>key</code>, which is used for accepting keyboard input.
When the <code>key</code> word is executed, execution is paused until a key is pressed. Once
a key is pressed, the key code of that key is pushed onto the stack. Try out the
following:</p>





<p>When you run this line, you’ll notice that at first nothing happens. This is because
the interpreter is waiting for your keyboard input. Try hitting the <code>A</code> key, and
you should see the keycode for that key, <code>65</code>, appear as output on the current line.
Now hit <code>B</code>, then <code>C</code>, and you should see the following:</p>

<p>key . key . key . <span>65 66 67  ok</span></p>

<h3 id="printing-keys-with-begin-until">Printing keys with <code>begin until</code></h3>

<p>Forth has another kind of loop called <code>begin until</code>. This works like a <code>while</code>
loop in C-based languages. Every time the word <code>until</code> is hit, the interpreter
checks to see if the top of the stack is non-zero (true). If it is, it jumps
back to the matching <code>begin</code>. If not, execution continues.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of using <code>begin until</code> to print key codes:</p>

<div><pre><code>: print-keycode  begin key dup . 32 = until ;
print-keycode
</code></pre></div>



<p>This will keep printing key codes until you press space. You should see something like this:</p>

<p>print-keycode <span>80 82 73 78 84 189 75 69 89 67 79 68 69 32  ok</span></p>

<p><code>key</code> waits for key input, then <code>dup</code> duplicates the keycode from <code>key</code>. We
then use <code>.</code> to output the top copy of the keycode, and <code>32 =</code> to check to see
if the keycode is equal to 32. If it is, we break out of the loop, otherwise we
loop back to <code>begin</code>.</p>

<h2 id="snake">Snake!</h2>

<p>Now it’s time to put it all together and make a game! Rather than having you type
all the code, I’ve pre-loaded it into the editor.</p>

<p>Before we look at the code, try playing the game. To start the game, execute the
word <code>start</code>. Then use the arrow keys to move the snake. If you lose, you can run
<code>start</code> again.</p>



<p>Before we delve too deeply into this code, two disclaimers. First, this is terrible
Forth code. I’m by no means a Forth expert, so there’s probably all kinds of things
I’m doing in completely the wrong way. Second, this game uses a few non-standard
techniques in order to interface with JavaScript. I’ll go through these now.</p>

<h3 id="non-standard-additions">Non-Standard Additions</h3>

<h4 id="the-canvas">The Canvas</h4>

<p>You may have noticed that this editor is different from the others: it has an HTML5
Canvas element built in. I’ve created a very simple memory-mapped interface for
drawing onto this canvas. The canvas is split up into 24 x 24 “pixels” which can
be black or white. The first pixel is found at the memory address given by the
variable <code>graphics</code>, and the rest of the pixels are offsets from the variable. So,
for example, to draw a white pixel in the top-left corner you could run</p>





<p>The game uses the following words to draw to the canvas:</p>

<div><pre><code>: convert-x-y ( x y -- offset )  24 cells * + ;
: draw ( color x y -- )  convert-x-y graphics + ! ;
: draw-white ( x y -- )  1 rot rot draw ;
: draw-black ( x y -- )  0 rot rot draw ;
</code></pre></div>

<p>For example, <code>3 4 draw-white</code> draws a white pixel at the coordinates (3, 4). The
y coordinate is multiplied by 24 to get the row, then the x coordinated is added
to get the column.</p>

<h4 id="non-blocking-keyboard-input">Non-Blocking Keyboard Input</h4>

<p>The Forth word <code>key</code> blocks, so is unsuitable for a game like this. I’ve added
a variable called <code>last-key</code> which always holds the value of the last key to be
pressed. <code>last-key</code> is only updated while the interpreter is running Forth code.</p>

<h4 id="random-number-generation">Random Number Generation</h4>

<p>The Forth standard doesn’t define a way of generating random numbers, so I’ve
added a word called <code>random ( range -- n )</code> that takes a range and returns a
random number from 0 to range - 1. For example, <code>3 random</code> could
return <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, or <code>2</code>.</p>

<h4 id="sleep--ms----"><code>sleep ( ms -- )</code></h4>

<p>Finally, I’ve added a blocking <code>sleep</code> word that pauses execution for the
number of milliseconds given.</p>

<h3 id="the-game-code">The Game Code</h3>

<p>Now we can work through the code from start to finish.</p>

<h4 id="variables-and-constants-1">Variables and Constants</h4>

<p>The start of the code just sets up some variables and constants:</p>

<div><pre><code>variable snake-x-head
500 cells allot

variable snake-y-head
500 cells allot

variable apple-x
variable apple-y

0 constant left
1 constant up
2 constant right
3 constant down

24 constant width
24 constant height

variable direction
variable length
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>snake-x-head</code> and <code>snake-y-head</code> are memory locations used to store the x and
y coordinates of the head of the snake. 500 cells of memory are alloted after
these two locations to store the coordinates of the tail of the snake.</p>

<p>Next we define two words for accessing memory locations representing the body
of the snake.</p>

<div><pre><code>: snake-x ( offset -- address )
  cells snake-x-head + ;

: snake-y ( offset -- address )
  cells snake-y-head + ;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Just like the <code>number</code> word earlier, these two words are used to access
elements in the arrays of snake segments. After this come some words for
drawing to the canvas, described above.</p>

<p>We use constants to refer to the four directions (<code>left</code>, <code>up</code>, <code>right</code>, and
<code>down</code>), and a variable <code>direction</code> to store the current direction.</p>

<h4 id="initialization">Initialization</h4>

<p>After this we initialize everything:</p>

<div><pre><code>: draw-walls
  width 0 do
    i 0 draw-black
    i height 1 - draw-black
  loop
  height 0 do
    0 i draw-black
    width 1 - i draw-black
  loop ;

: initialize-snake
  4 length !
  length @ 1 + 0 do
    12 i - i snake-x !
    12 i snake-y !
  loop
  right direction ! ;

: set-apple-position apple-x ! apple-y ! ;

: initialize-apple  4 4 set-apple-position ;

: initialize
  width 0 do
    height 0 do
      j i draw-white
    loop
  loop
  draw-walls
  initialize-snake
  initialize-apple ;
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>draw-walls</code> uses two <code>do/loop</code>s to draw the horizontal and vertical walls,
respectively.</p>

<p><code>initialize-snake</code> sets the <code>length</code> variable to <code>4</code>, then loops from <code>0</code> to
<code>length + 1</code> filling in the starting snake positions. The snake positions are
always kept one longer than the length so we can grow the snake easily.</p>

<p><code>set-apple-position</code> and <code>initialize-apple</code> set the initial position of the
apple to (4,4).</p>

<p>Finally, <code>initialize</code> fills everything in white and calls the three
initialization words.</p>

<h4 id="moving-the-snake">Moving the Snake</h4>

<p>Here’s the code for moving the snake based on the current value of <code>direction</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>: move-up  -1 snake-y-head +! ;
: move-left  -1 snake-x-head +! ;
: move-down  1 snake-y-head +! ;
: move-right  1 snake-x-head +! ;

: move-snake-head  direction @
  left over  = if move-left else
  up over    = if move-up else
  right over = if move-right else
  down over  = if move-down
  then then then then drop ;

\ Move each segment of the snake forward by one
: move-snake-tail  0 length @ do
    i snake-x @ i 1 + snake-x !
    i snake-y @ i 1 + snake-y !
  -1 +loop ;
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>move-up</code>, <code>move-left</code>, <code>move-down</code>, and <code>move-right</code> just add or subtract one
from the x or y coordinate of the snake head. <code>move-snake-head</code> inspects the
value of <code>direction</code> and calls the appropriate <code>move-*</code> word. This <code>over = if</code>
pattern is an idiomatic way of doing case statements in Forth.</p>

<p><code>move-snake-tail</code> goes through the array of snake positions backwards, copying
each value forward by 1 cell. This is called before we move the snake head, to
move each segment of the snake forward one space. It uses a <code>do/+loop</code>, a
variation of a <code>do/loop</code> that pops the stack on every iteration and adds that
value to the next index, instead of incrementing by 1 each time. So <code>0 length @
do -1 +loop</code> loops from <code>length</code> to <code>0</code> in increments of <code>-1</code>.</p>

<h4 id="keyboard-input-1">Keyboard Input</h4>

<p>The next section of code takes the keyboard input and changes the snake direction
if appropriate.</p>

<div><pre><code>: is-horizontal  direction @ dup
  left = swap
  right = or ;

: is-vertical  direction @ dup
  up = swap
  down = or ;

: turn-up     is-horizontal if up direction ! then ;
: turn-left   is-vertical if left direction ! then ;
: turn-down   is-horizontal if down direction ! then ;
: turn-right  is-vertical if right direction ! then ;

: change-direction ( key -- )
  37 over = if turn-left else
  38 over = if turn-up else
  39 over = if turn-right else
  40 over = if turn-down
  then then then then drop ;

: check-input
  last-key @ change-direction
  0 last-key ! ;
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>is-horizontal</code> and <code>is-vertical</code> check the current status of the <code>direction</code>
variable to see if it’s a horizontal or vertical direction.</p>

<p>The <code>turn-*</code> words are used to set a new direction, but use <code>is-horizontal</code> and
<code>is-vertical</code> to check the current direction first to see if the new direction
is valid. For example, if the snake is moving horizontally, setting a new
direction of <code>left</code> or <code>right</code> doesn’t make sense.</p>

<p><code>change-direction</code> takes a key and calls the appropriate <code>turn-*</code> word if the
key was one of the arrow keys. <code>check-input</code> does the work of getting the last
key from the <code>last-key</code> pseudo-variable, calling <code>change-direction</code>, then setting
<code>last-key</code> to 0 to indicate that the most recent keypress has been dealt with.</p>

<h4 id="the-apple">The Apple</h4>

<p>The next code is used for checking to see if the apple has been eaten, and if so,
moving it to a new (random) location. Also, if the apple has been eaten we grow
the snake.</p>

<div><pre><code>\ get random x or y position within playable area
: random-position ( -- pos )
  width 4 - random 2 + ;

: move-apple
  apple-x @ apple-y @ draw-white
  random-position random-position
  set-apple-position ;

: grow-snake  1 length +! ;

: check-apple ( -- flag )
  snake-x-head @ apple-x @ =
  snake-y-head @ apple-y @ =
  and if
    move-apple
    grow-snake
  then ;
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>random-position</code> generates a random x or y coordinate in the range of <code>2</code> to
<code>width - 2</code>. This prevents the apple from ever appearing right next to the wall.</p>

<p><code>move-apple</code> erases the current apple (using <code>draw-white</code>) then creates a new
pair of x/y coordinates for the apple using <code>random-position</code> twice. Finally,
it calls <code>set-apple-position</code> to move the apple to the new coordinates.</p>

<p><code>grow-snake</code> simply adds one to the <code>length</code> variable.</p>

<p><code>check-apple</code> compares the x/y coordinates of the apple and the snake head to
see if they’re the same (using <code>=</code> twice and <code>and</code> to combine the two
booleans). If the coordinates are the same, we call <code>move-apple</code> to move the
apple to a new position and <code>grow-snake</code> to make the snake 1 segment longer.</p>

<h4 id="collision-detection">Collision Detection</h4>

<p>Next we see if the snake has collided with the walls or itself.</p>

<div><pre><code>: check-collision ( -- flag )
  \ get current x/y position
  snake-x-head @ snake-y-head @

  \ get color at current position
  convert-x-y graphics + @

  \ leave boolean flag on stack
  0 = ;
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>check-collision</code> checks to see if the new snake head position is already black
(this word is called <em>after</em> updating the snake’s position but <em>before</em> drawing
it at the new position). We leave a boolean on the stack to say whether a
collision has occured or not.</p>

<h4 id="drawing-the-snake-and-apple">Drawing the Snake and Apple</h4>

<p>The next two words are responsible for drawing the snake and apple.</p>

<div><pre><code>: draw-snake
  length @ 0 do
    i snake-x @ i snake-y @ draw-black
  loop
  length @ snake-x @
  length @ snake-y @
  draw-white ;

: draw-apple
  apple-x @ apple-y @ draw-black ;
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>draw-snake</code> loops through each cell in the snake arrays, drawing a black pixel
for each one. After that it draws a white pixel at an offset of <code>length</code>. The
last part of the tail is at <code>length - 1</code> into the array so <code>length</code> holds the
previous last tail segment.</p>

<p><code>draw-apple</code> simply draws a black pixel at the apple’s current location.</p>

<h4 id="the-game-loop">The Game Loop</h4>

<p>The game loop constantly loops until a collision occurs, calling each of the
words defined above in turn.</p>

<div><pre><code>: game-loop ( -- )
  begin
    draw-snake
    draw-apple
    100 sleep
    check-input
    move-snake-tail
    move-snake-head
    check-apple
    check-collision
  until
  ." Game Over" ;

: start  initialize game-loop ;
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>begin/until</code> loop uses the boolean returned by <code>check-collision</code> to see
whether to continue looping or to exit the loop. When the loop is exited the
string <code>"Game Over"</code> is printed. We use <code>100 sleep</code> to pause for 100 ms every
iteration, making the game run at rougly 10 fps.</p>

<p><code>start</code> just calls <code>initialize</code> to reset everything, then kicks off <code>game-loop</code>.
Because all the initialization happens in the <code>initialize</code> word, you can call
<code>start</code> again after game over.</p>

<hr>

<p>And that’s it! Hopefully all the code in the game made sense. If not, you can
try running individual words to see their effect on the stack and/or on the
variables.</p>

<h2 id="the-end">The End</h2>

<p>Forth is actually much more powerful than what I’ve taught here (and what I
implemented in my interpreter). A true Forth system allows you to modify how
the compiler works and create new defining words, allowing you to completely
customize your environment and create your own languages within Forth.</p>

<p>A great resource for learning the full power of Forth is the short book
<a href="http://www.forth.com/starting-forth/">“Starting Forth”</a> by Leo Brodie. It’s
available for free online and teaches you all the fun stuff I left out. It also
has a good set of exercises for you to test out your knowledge. You’ll need to
download a copy of <a href="http://www.forth.com/swiftforth/dl.html">SwiftForth</a> to run
the code though.</p>

<p>A duo of Tesla shareholder-influencers tried to complete Elon Musk’s coast-to-coast self-driving ride that he claimed Tesla would be able to do in 2017 and they crashed before making it about 60 miles.</p>



<p>In 2016, Elon Musk infamously said that Tesla would complete a fully self-driving coast-to-coast drive between Los Angeles and New York by the end of 2017.</p>



<p>The idea was to livestream or film a full unedited drive coast-to-coast with the vehicle driving itself at all times.</p>



<p>We are in 2025 and Tesla never made that drive.</p>	
	



<p>Despite the many missed autonomous driving goals, many Tesla shareholders believe that the company is on the verge of delivering unsupervised self-driving following the rollout of its ‘Robotaxi’ fleet in Austin, which requires supervision from Tesla employees inside the vehicles, and improvements to its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) systems inside consumer vehicles, which is still only a level 2 driver assist system that requires driver attention at all times as per Tesla.</p>



<p>Two of these Tesla shareholders and online influencers attempted to undertake a coast-to-coast drive between San Diego, CA, and Jacksonville, FL, in a Tesla Model Y equipped with the latest FSD software update.</p>



<p>They didn’t make it out of California without crashing into easily avoidable road debris that badly damaged the Tesla Model Y:</p>

<p>In the video, you can see that the driver doesn’t have his hands on the steering wheel. The passenger spots the debris way ahead of time. There was plenty of time to react, but the driver didn’t get his hands on the steering wheel until the last second.</p>

<p>In a follow-up video, the two Tesla influencers confirmed that the Model Y had a broken sway bar bracket and damaged suspension components.&nbsp;The vehicle is also throwing out a lot of warnings.</p>



<p>They made it about 2.5% of the planned trip on Tesla FSD v13.9 before crashing the vehicle.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>Tesla shareholders used to discuss this somewhat rationally back in the day, but now that Tesla’s EV business is in decline and the stock price depends entirely on the self-driving and robot promises, they no longer do.</p>



<p>I recall when Musk himself used to say that when you reach 99% self-driving, it is when the “march of the 9s” begins, and you must achieve 99.999999999% autonomy to have a truly useful self-driving system. He admitted that this is the most challenging part as the real-world is unpredictable and hard to simulate – throwing a lot of challenging scenario at you, such as debris on the road.</p>



<p>That’s where Tesla is right now. The hard part has just started. And there’s no telling how long it will take to get there. If someone is telling you that they know, they are lying. I don’t know. My best estimate is approximately 2-3 years and a new hardware suite.</p>



<p>However, competition, mainly Waymo, began its own “march of the 9s” about five years ago.</p>



<p>Tesla is still years behind, and something like this drive by these two Tesla influencers proves it.</p>




	<p>I was actually in a similar accident in a Tesla Model 3 back in 2020. I rented a Model 3 on Turo for a trip to Las Vegas from Los Angeles.</p>



<p>I ended up driving over a blown-out truck tire in the middle of the road like this. I was Autopilot, but I don’t know if the car saw it. I definitely saw it, but it was a bit late as I was following a truck that just drove over it. I had probably less than 2 seconds to react. I applied the brakes, but my choices were driving into a ditch on the right or into a car in the left lane.</p>



<p>I managed to reduce the force of the impact with the braking, but the vehicle jumped a bit like in this video. There wasn’t really any damage to the front, but the bottom cover was flapping down. I taped it together at the next gas station and I was able to continue the trip without much issue.</p>



<p>However, after returning it to the Turo owner and having the suspension damage evaluated by Tesla, the repair job was estimated to be roughly $10,000. I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a similar situation with this accident.</p>
