<p>Last week, hackers defaced the Internet Archive website with a message that said, "Have you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See 31 million of you on HIBP!"</p>
<p>HIBP is a reference to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned</a>, which was created by security researcher Troy Hunt and provides information and notifications on data breaches. The hacked Internet Archive data was sent to Have I Been Pwned and "contains authentication information for registered members, including their email addresses, screen names, password change timestamps, Bcrypt-hashed passwords, and other internal data," <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/internet-archive-hacked-data-breach-impacts-31-million-users/">BleepingComputer wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Kahle <a href="https://x.com/brewster_kahle/status/1844183111514603812">said on October 9</a> that the Internet Archive fended off a DDoS attack and was working on upgrading security in light of the data breach and website defacement. The next day, he <a href="https://x.com/brewster_kahle/status/1844326137499177312">reported</a> that the "DDoS folks are back" and had knocked the site offline. The Internet Archive "is being cautious and prioritizing keeping data safe at the expense of service availability," he added.</p>
<p>"Services are offline as we examine and strengthen them... Estimated Timeline: days, not weeks," he <a href="https://x.com/brewster_kahle/status/1844790609573277792">wrote</a> on October 11. "Thank you for the offers of pizza (we are set)."</p>

          <p>TLDR; <a href="https://dir.floss.fund/submit">Apply now</a></p>
<hr>
<p>We are excited to announce the launch of a dedicated fund aimed at providing financial assistance to Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FOSS/FLOSS) projects globally, with an annual commitment of $1 million. I will use the FOSS acronym in this post hereafter.</p>
<p>This has been in the works for some time at Zerodha<sup><a href="https://zerodha.com/">[↗]</a></sup>, where we have been developing financial technology products and services built on an ever-growing FOSS stack. Without the high-quality FOSS projects that we have freely downloaded and used to build our organisation, products, and services, we would not exist as we do today—free as in both cost and freedom. A significant portion of our success and growth is owed to FOSS, encompassing everything from programming languages to operating systems, to databases, web servers, frontend frameworks, productivity tools, code editors, and absolutely everything. It goes without saying that this holds true for nearly every technology company founded in the last decade, whether it is publicly acknowledged or not.</p>
<p>And yet, funding and financial sustainability, the lack thereof really, has been an increasingly hot topic over the last many years. Well, at least since <em>cloud</em> companies began making massive profits directly repackaging FOSS projects built by hobbyists and communities. The rise of the "open core" model and the unfortunate license changes in many good open projects recently, are clear signs of this growing turmoil. Many potential solutions seem to be emerging and evoling—commercial services, Venture Capital (VC) funding, and programs like GitHub Sponsors<sup><a href="https://github.com/sponsors">[↗]</a></sup>, Open Collective<sup><a href="https://opencollective.com/">[↗]</a></sup>, FUTO<sup><a href="https://futo.org/">[↗]</a></sup>, Polar<sup><a href="https://polar.sh/">[↗]</a></sup>, and <em>Buy me a coffee</em><sup><a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/">[↗]</a></sup>, amongst others. That said, Python libraries raising massive amounts of VC funding in quick time does not look like a healthy trend.</p>
<p>Why are we here, though? The fundamental tenets of FOSS, the spirit of hacking, liberty, and reciprocity, while they have worked beautifully with code, have translated poorly into the highly commercial <em>BigTech</em> era. So far, it has been nearly impossible to quantify and structure ideas of goodwill and reciprocity into financial sustenance for FOSS projects. I recall the log4j incident from a couple of years ago which unleashed a spate of philosophical debates around  FOSS, in which I also participated<sup><a href="https://nadh.in/blog/open-source-is-not-broken/">[↗]</a></sup>, rather ideologically.</p>
<p>For us, FLOSS/fund is about hacker goodwill, reciprocity, and common sense business strategy. We invite you to <a href="https://dir.floss.fund/submit">apply for funding</a>. If you would like to understand the motivations behind this, a bit of storytelling lies ahead.</p>
<h2 id="prelude">Prelude</h2>
<p>The very first thing I did when we started Zerodha Tech more than a decade ago was to install Python and start scripting and automating time-consuming, mundane organisational tasks. Then came Postgres for building a small data warehouse, followed by PHP and WordPress for managing our website. From there, as we slowly grew the organisation, our technology stack expanded one piece of FOSS at a time, eventually leading to us becoming the largest stock broker in India several years later. Personally, my mental markup as a software developer and hacker is rooted in the simple act of copy-pasting open source code from the internet to hack, tinker, learn, and solve problems. An alternate vision is very difficult for me to comprehend, and a non-FOSS path to building technology, let alone an organisation, has never seemed logical.</p>
<p>At Zerodha, over the years, we have contributed upstream to many projects that we use, as well as spun off and released several small and large FOSS projects<sup><a href="https://zerodha.tech/">[↗]</a></sup> from our work. In 2019, we made a sizeable investment in ERPNext<sup><a href="https://erpnext.com/">[↗]</a></sup>, a FOSS ERP that we had begun using extensively. In 2020, we co-founded the FOSS United Foundation<sup><a href="https://fossunited.org/">[↗]</a></sup>, which works on developing the FOSS ecosystem in India, and backed the creation of TinkerSpace<sup><a href="https://www.tinkerhub.org/tinkerspace">[↗]</a></sup>, a physical hackerspace and community center that hosts FOSS tinkering for young people. In 2023, we were a founding member of OASIS (Open-Source Alliance for Social Innovation and Sustainability)<sup><a href="https://oasishq.org/">[↗]</a></sup>, which focuses on FOSS capacity building and adoption in social sector non-profit organisations. Many of us from our team also volunteer at non-profits, helping drive meaningful FOSS adoption in the development sector, where even basic technological requirements are woefully unmet. We fund many of these initiatives with long-term commitments.</p>
<p>In addition, we have given out many sizeable grants to FOSS projects and organisations in India. While funding projects outside India involves significant paperwork and operational overhead, we have reached out to several small and large projects that we use at work and have managed to pay them. This highly ad hoc approach is something that has increasingly bugged me though.</p>
<p>While it is good to provide financial support to FOSS-aligned activities, most importantly, money ought to go directly to the source—invaluable FOSS projects. We have managed to build a commercially successful business on top of FOSS that we have freely, in both cost and freedom, adopted from all over the world. Therefore, "ad hoc" and "reaching out" simply do not suffice—we have to shut up or put up.</p>
<h2 id="thus-structure">Thus, structure.</h2>
<p>And that is how the idea of a structured, dedicated fund for FOSS projects globally, was born. We spent several months speaking to various banks, payment processors, and lawyers to finally arrive at a reasonably streamlined process. The fund will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a small, dedicated team to operate it properly in a non-adhoc manner, functioning like an OSPO (Open Source Program Office) but focused on funding projects—an OSFO (Open Source Funding Office), perhaps?</li>
<li>Put money where the mouth is—a minimum of $10,000 and up to $100,000 for a single recipient, totaling $1 million per year, which we will increase once we understand the dynamics of running the fund.</li>
<li>Source applications globally, relying on incoming applications through for discovering projects in need of support rather than the limited visibility we have as a small team.</li>
<li>Form an interim internal selection committee to make discretionary selections. Once potential edge cases and any gotchas in running the program are handled, we will attempt to establish a public selection committee from the FOSS ecosystem with a community voting process for applications.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="more-structure-funding-json">More structure: funding.json</h2>
<p>Expanding a bit on "ad hoc" and "reaching out" I mentioned earlier, the  majority of our experience paying projects has transpired like this:</p>
<p>On a random day, we realise that a certain FOSS project has become very useful to us. After a bit of online searching, we find the developer's email address. We write to the developer, thanking them for their work, explaining how useful we find it, and expressing our interest in financially supporting it. They respond, thanking us but stating that they have not thought of any specific numbers. After a bit of friendly back and forth, we suggest an arbitrary amount, followed by more discussion about logistics and paperwork. This process of arriving at numbers over personal e-mails is awkward for both parties. It addition, it typically takes weeks, requiring time, commitment, and bandwidth from both the developer and the donor to complete a single transaction. Models like Open Collective and GitHub Sponsors address this to some extent, but there is no open, decentralized mechanism for discovering projects in need of financial assistance nor gaining insights into their specific needs.</p>
<p>Any attempt on funding FOSS projects generally warrants clarity on several questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the project under consideration need financial assistance?</li>
<li>Or perhaps it is not just one particular project, but a developer or a group of developers who maintain several projects that need assistance.</li>
<li>What kind and quantum of financial assistance are needed, and for what activities? Is there a structured support plan that the developers offer?</li>
<li>Has the project received any funding in the past? Is it in dire need of support, or is it doing reasonably well?</li>
<li>What payment methods are accepted? Is there a payment link or address that can be used without manual contact, or is something like a bank wire that is required?</li>
<li>Once there is enough context, and a conversation is warranted, how does one reach out to the right person who address financial or logistical queries?</li>
<li>That's about one project. But what about a particular category of projects? Maybe it is an emerging or critical area, and it would make sense to support multiple projects there. How does one discover them?</li>
</ul>
<p>What if the answers to such questions could be structured in a machine readable format, which could be crawled, indexed, catalogued, and made discoverable—similar to a <code>robots.txt</code> or <code>package.json</code> or <code>sitemap.xml</code>, but for funding. In the process, eliminating a lot of awkwardness and apprehension that would be otherwise transpire over back-and-forth personal e-mails discussing financial matters.</p>
<p>How about a standardised <code>funding.json</code> manifest file that can be added to project repositories and websites signalling their financial needs? Something like this:</p>

<p>To initiate and give this experiment a serious shot, FLOSS/fund will accept funding requests from projects through a publicly accessible <code>funding.json</code> file hosted on their respositories or websites. This file is not meant to convey everything there is to know—an impossible task—but to solicit interest and communicate enough to ensure discoverability which would not be possible otherwise. Refer to the <a href="https://floss.fund/funding-manifest">funding.json docs</a> to know more.</p>
<p>Applications that come through to the FLOSS/fund will be indexed and published on the <a href="https://dir.floss.fund/">dir.floss.fund</a> directory / portal, making them publicly discoverable by anyone interested in supporting projects. This is going to be an interesting experiment. Fingers crossed!</p>
<h2 id="motivations">Motivations</h2>
<p>What are the motivations behind the fund? On a personal level, it is common sense, goodwill, and reciprocity—the spirit of FOSS. From a for-profit enterprise perspective, however, terms like "goodwill" and "reciprocity" are notoriously problematic, and most likely fundamentally incompatible with their very nature. But, that is a separate philosophical debate altogether.</p>
<p>Setting philosophies aside, it makes perfect logical sense for a business that relies on FOSS to support it, directly or indirectly, when they freely tap into a global ecosystem of unlimited FOSS innovation—free in both cost and freedom. How many technology companies today could even exist without the massive amounts of FOSS they use? Ensuring that this ecosystem thrives, without inadvertently turning parts of it into a classic tragedy of the commons, everything aside, is good, logical business strategy. At the very least, a profitable business should allocate a tiny fraction of its profits to support the projects it is directly reliant on. When many startups have advertising and marketing budgets that often put public spending to shame, one would be hard-pressed to find a reason not to give a bit of money  to the projects they depend on for their very existence.</p>
<p>Thus, FLOSS/fund's motivations are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise our goodwill and reciprocity on a personal level as FOSS hackers.</li>
<li>Exercise our organisational business sense and strategy to help the FOSS ecosystem thrive, without which our business cannot exist.</li>
<li>Encourage and apply a bit of peer-pressure on other businesses to setup structured financial support programmes for FOSS.</li>
<li>Contribute to existing FOSS funding models and to the sustainability conversations and debates.</li>
<li>As a bonus: Explore whether the <code>funding.json</code> manifest experiment can bring discoverability to the financial needs of FOSS projects on a large scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us see how this goes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>We have found that you could be leaking traffic on macOS after system updates. To our current knowledge a reboot resolves it. We are currently investigating this and will follow up with more information.</p>
<h2>The current state</h2>
<p>In this scenario the macOS firewall does not seem to function correctly and is disregarding firewall rules. Most traffic will still go inside the VPN tunnel since the routing table specifies that it should. Unfortunately apps are not required to respect the routing table and can send traffic outside the tunnel if they try to. Some examples of apps that do this are Apple’s own apps and services since macOS 14.6, up until a recent 15.1 beta.</p>
<h2>What’s next?</h2>
<p>We’ve reported this to Apple and hopefully we’ll see a fix in the near future. In the meanwhile we will continue to investigate this to be able to provide more information to Apple and to see if there are any workarounds that we can implement in the app.</p>
<h2>Check if you are affected</h2>
<p>Run the following commands in a terminal to check if you are affected:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Add a firewall rule that blocks all traffic</p>
<pre><code>echo "block drop quick all" | sudo pfctl -ef -</code></pre>
<p>2. Try to send traffic outside the tunnel</p>
<pre><code>curl https://am.i.mullvad.net/connected</code></pre>
<p>To clean up after the experiment, disable the firewall and clear all rules.</p>
<pre><code>sudo pfctl -d</code><br><code>sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf</code></pre>
<p>It is also possible to check if our app is leaking by doing the following:</p>
<p>1. Make sure you are not connected to a VPN<br>2. Find the default interface by running the following command in a terminal</p>
<pre><code>route get mullvad.net | sed -nE 's/.*interface: //p'</code></pre>
<p>3. Connect to a VPN server using our app<br>4. Run the following command (replace “&lt;interface&gt;” with the interface from step 2)</p>
<pre><code>curl --interface &lt;interface&gt; https://am.i.mullvad.net/connected</code></pre>
<p>5. The request should time out if everything is working properly. If there is a response then you are leaking.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Inspired by numerous people migrating their Next.js applications from Vercel to self-hosted VPS on Hetzner due to pricing concerns, I decided to explore self-hosting some of my non-critical applications. Additionally, I wanted to push my technical boundaries by running Llama 3.2 using Ollama and making its API available to power AI applications for my business, Wisp.</p><p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lLmNeOP7HXG0OqaG97wimw/clwdlsohu0000v1qer09du8mo/f532cf09-87ff-435b-bede-be0677b4419f.jpg/public" alt="Home server as a step stool"></p><p>The objective was to breathe new life into an old home server that once ran high-frequency trading and MEV algorithms but had since become a step stool for my daughter to climb onto the TV console.</p><p>This blog post chronicles my journey of setting up Coolify to run Ollama (using Llama 3.2) on my home server, with a particular focus on the challenges and triumphs of enabling GPU acceleration using the CUDA toolkit.</p><p>(Update)</p><p>Since some of you are curious, this is how Llama 3.2 3B perform on a GeForce RTX 2060:</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vhJ6fNW8AI"></iframe></p><h2>My Goals</h2><p>The primary idea was to leverage my home server, previously gathering dust, to perform valuable tasks. Specifically, I wanted it to host and automate AI-related functions. Additionally, this setup would provide a centralized location to run Supabase for storing various data. The broader goal includes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Serving a Next.js website</strong>: This site should be live on the public Internet, auto-deploy from the master branch, work with a public subdomain, and maintain no open public ports for security.</p></li><li><p><strong>Running Llama 3.2</strong>: Utilizing the GPU for agentic tasks and making a locally accessible API.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wildcard domain</strong>: Enabling new services to spin up effortlessly under varied subdomains.</p></li></ul><h2>Overall Experience</h2><p>Setting up this environment was no small feat, but each step was a valuable learning experience. Here's a walkthrough of my journey:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Installing Ubuntu 24</strong>: This was a breeze, requiring only a single reboot.</p></li><li><p><strong>Coolify Installation</strong>: The process was smooth thanks to the handy install script, which ensured most prerequisites were met. A minor hiccup was resolved by running commands as root to avoid permission issues with the <code>/data</code> directory.</p></li><li><p><strong>Configuring Coolify</strong>: Initially, setting the server as <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost/">localhost</a> prevented assigning a domain via Cloudflare Tunnel. The fix involved adding the host as a second 'server'. Moreover, configuring the tunnel and SSL correctly took time but was crucial for security and functionality.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cloudflare Tunnel</strong>: Patience was key here. The wildcard domain setup was essential, and understanding the nuances of Cloudflare’s free SSL certificate coverage saved time and money.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deployment Wins</strong>: Successfully hosting my personal blog using Coolify over a Cloudflare Tunnel was a significant morale boost, fueling the energy needed to proceed with the Ollama setup.</p></li><li><p><strong>Running Ollama</strong>: Coolify made deploying the Ollama service straightforward. However, initial trials showed slow inference speeds and heavy CPU usage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enabling GPU</strong>: Ubuntu 24 had the NVIDIA drivers pre-installed, but CUDA toolkit installation and configuration posed challenges. Persistent efforts led to discovering the need for the <code>nvidia-container-toolkit</code> and Docker service configuration modifications to enable GPU usage. The results were remarkable, reducing inference time by over 10x.</p></li><li><p><strong>API Exposure</strong>: Securing the LLM API with an API key became the next challenge. After unsuccessful attempts with nginx, I found potential solutions by using Caddy. Something I'll work on next after writing this post.</p></li></ol><h2><strong>Server Specifications</strong></h2><p>For context, here are the specifications of my home server:</p><ul><li><p><strong>CPU</strong>: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core</p></li><li><p><strong>GPU</strong>: GeForce RTX 2060</p></li><li><p><strong>RAM</strong>: 4 x 16GB DDR4 3200 MT/s</p></li><li><p><strong>SSD</strong>: 2TB SSD + 8TB SSD</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Step-by-Step Guide</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. Install Ubuntu (For a New Setup)</strong></h3><p>Start by installing Ubuntu on your home server. Follow the detailed guide available on the <a target="_blank" href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop"><strong>official Ubuntu website</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Important Settings:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Avoid using LVM or disk encryption for a smoother reboot experience and easier server management. Note that this trade-off means anyone with physical access can read your data.</p></li><li><p>Ensure the installation of third-party drivers to automatically get the NVIDIA driver.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Install SSH</strong></h3><p>Enable SSH to access your server remotely, which is especially useful if you’re managing it from another machine on your local network. Refer to this <a target="_blank" href="https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-enable-ssh-on-ubuntu-20-04/"><strong>SSH setup guide for Ubuntu 20.04</strong></a>, suitable for Ubuntu 24 as well.</p><h3><strong>Update and Upgrade APT</strong></h3><p>Always perform an update and upgrade for your packages:</p><pre><code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y</code></pre><h3>Useful Commands</h3><p>Here are some additional commands for printing information about your machine and setup:</p><ul><li><p>View CPU usage: <code>htop</code></p></li><li><p>List NVIDIA graphics card information: <code>lspci | grep -i nvidia</code></p></li><li><p>Print architecture, OS distro, release: <code>uname -m &amp;&amp; cat /etc/*release</code></p></li><li><p>Print physical RAM installed: <code>sudo dmidecode --type memory | less</code></p></li><li><p>Print processor info: <code>cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep 'name'| uniq</code></p></li><li><p>Check NVIDIA driver information: <code>nvidia-smi</code></p></li></ul><h3><strong>2. Installing Coolify</strong></h3><p><a target="_blank" href="https://coolify.io/">Coolify</a> is an open-source platform designed to make deploying and managing your applications on self-hosted environments easier. Its key feature is allowing users to manage full-stack applications, databases, and services without relying on complex Kubernetes setups. Coolify streamlines deployments through a user-friendly interface, supporting services like Docker, GitHub, and GitLab.</p><p>To install Coolify, follow the automated installation instructions from <a target="_blank" href="https://coolify.io/docs/installation/">their documentation</a>:</p><pre><code>curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash</code></pre><p><strong>Important Notes</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Ensure you’re logged in as the root user to avoid permission issues.</p></li><li><p>The installation script checks prerequisites, but you may need to troubleshoot some dependency errors if they arise.</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lLmNeOP7HXG0OqaG97wimw/clwdlsohu0000v1qer09du8mo/43c2d6eb-aba3-45ab-aad9-0f47e8895fa5.png/public" alt="Coolify onboarding screen"></p><p>Once Coolify is installed:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Visit the coolify dashboard</strong> at <code>http://localhost:8000</code> . This is also available on the network. Replace localhost with the ip address of the server if you are accessing it from another machine.</p></li><li><p><strong>Set up an admin account</strong> - this is stored locally on your server.</p></li><li><p><strong>Create your first project</strong> by adding a resource and deploying it to <code>localhost</code>. In my case, I deployed my personal blog first to test the setup.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>3. Setting Up a Cloudflare Tunnel on Coolify</strong></h3><p>Cloudflare Tunnel is a secure way to expose services running on your local network to the public internet without having to open ports on your router. For my setup, this was a key feature, as I wanted to keep my server behind a firewall while still allowing external access to some services.</p><p>Cloudflare’s Zero Trust platform ensures that all traffic is encrypted and routed securely, preventing unauthorized access.</p><p>To set up a Cloudflare Tunnel, follow this instructions on Coolify’s <a target="_blank" href="https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels">official documentation</a>. The key is to focus on setting up <strong>wildcard subdomains</strong> for all your services.</p><p>A few key caveats:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Localhost Server Issue</strong>: You cannot assign a domain to the pre-created <code>localhost</code> server directly. To solve this, add your host as a second server within Coolify, using the IP address <code>172.17.0.1</code> for <code>host.docker.internal</code> (since coolify will show an error that <code>host.docker.internal</code> has already been assigned to a server).</p></li><li><p><strong>Wildcard Domain Setup</strong>: Make sure you use a top-level domain like <code>*.example.com</code>. If you use a wildcard on a subdomain, Cloudflare will not provide a free SSL certificate, unless you opt for the ACM plan.</p></li></ol><p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lLmNeOP7HXG0OqaG97wimw/clwdlsohu0000v1qer09du8mo/4c338964-bf9d-4466-975a-fca268f56795.png/public"></p><p>After setting up the Cloudflare Tunnel:</p><ul><li><p>Deploy your resources to the newly added server.</p></li><li><p>Change the domain in the service configuration to match your new subdomain.</p></li><li><p>Once everything is deployed, you should be able to access your service live from its custom domain.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>4. Deploying Ollama</strong></h3><p>Once you’ve set up your Coolify project, the next step is to deploy Ollama. This service allows you to run large language models (LLMs) like Llama 3.2 on your server with a web-based interface.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Add a New Resource</strong>: In your Coolify project, select "Add Resource" and choose <strong>Ollama with Open WebUI</strong> as the service you want to deploy to your new server.</p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lLmNeOP7HXG0OqaG97wimw/clwdlsohu0000v1qer09du8mo/2b634b6c-17db-4f5c-afba-615b4cc1cef0.png/public" alt="Deploying Ollama in Coolify"></li><li><p><strong>Configure the Domain</strong>: After adding Ollama, configure the domain for the Open WebUI service. Assign a domain from the wildcard domain you set up earlier through Cloudflare Tunnel. This will allow you to access the Ollama WebUI directly from the internet.</p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lLmNeOP7HXG0OqaG97wimw/clwdlsohu0000v1qer09du8mo/d7eb2920-5e28-47b9-9d02-9cb3740ca3b5.png/public" alt="Configuring domain on Coolify resource"></li><li><p><strong>Deploy the Service</strong>: Once everything is set up, click on "Deploy."</p><p>You should now be able to access the Open WebUI via the assigned domain. Upon your first login, you'll be prompted to create an admin account. This is important for managing models and access through the UI.</p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lLmNeOP7HXG0OqaG97wimw/clwdlsohu0000v1qer09du8mo/69c5be6f-4570-4bea-b334-123c5b9cb25f.png/public" alt="WebUI for Ollama"></li><li><p><strong>Install Llama 3.2</strong>: With your admin account set up, you can now install the latest Llama model. Head to <a target="_blank" href="https://ollama.com/library">Ollama's library</a> and search for the Llama model you want to use. I opted for <strong>Llama 3.2</strong>, which can be installed using the tag <code>llama3.2</code>.</p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lLmNeOP7HXG0OqaG97wimw/clwdlsohu0000v1qer09du8mo/6d081703-a0eb-4412-97d0-05bb765f3afc.png/public" alt="Downloading models using WebUI with Ollama"></li><li><p><strong>Try Your First Chat</strong>: Once installed, initiate your first chat with Llama 3.2 via the web interface. During this phase, your model will likely run on the CPU, so expect to hear your machine working hard (with increased CPU fan noise).</p><p>To monitor your machine’s performance during this, use the following commands:</p><ul><li><p><code>htop</code> to keep an eye on <strong>CPU usage</strong>.</p></li><li><p><code>watch -n 0.5 nvidia-smi</code> to track <strong>GPU usage</strong> (though at this stage, GPU may not be utilized yet).</p></li></ul><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lLmNeOP7HXG0OqaG97wimw/clwdlsohu0000v1qer09du8mo/6052bfb2-63bb-49cf-a75b-c4f643dee830.png/public" alt="Crazy CPU usage when Llama 3.2 runs using CPU"></li></ol><h3><strong>5. Configuring Ollama to Use GPU</strong></h3><p>Large language models (LLMs) like Llama 3.2 perform significantly better with GPU acceleration. GPUs, particularly those from NVIDIA, are optimized for the heavy parallel computations involved in AI workloads, which is where CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) comes into play. The CUDA toolkit enables direct GPU acceleration for applications like Ollama, drastically reducing inference time and CPU load.</p><p>This is arguably the most challenging step in setting up Ollama on your server, but here’s a breakdown of the process:</p><ol><li><p><strong>(Already Done)</strong>: Install the NVIDIA driver (this should have been handled during your Ubuntu installation).</p></li><li><p><strong>Install the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit</strong>: This toolkit is necessary to unlock GPU acceleration.</p></li><li><p><strong>(Optional)</strong>: Test that the CUDA toolkit is working correctly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit</strong>: This will allow Docker containers (like Ollama) to access the GPU.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enable the Ollama service in Coolify to use the GPU</strong>.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Install the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit</strong></p><p>Follow NVIDIA’s official <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#ubuntu">installation guide</a> to install the CUDA toolkit for your system. I recommend using the <strong>network repository installation method</strong> for the most flexibility and ease of updates.</p><ol><li><p>Install the new <code>cuda-keyring</code> package:</p><pre><code>wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/&lt;distro&gt;/&lt;arch&gt;/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb</code></pre><p>Replace <code>&lt;distro&gt;/&lt;arch&gt;</code> with the appropriate value for your distribution and architecture:</p><ul><li><p><code>ubuntu2004/arm64</code></p></li><li><p><code>ubuntu2004/sbsa</code></p></li><li><p><code>ubuntu2004/x86_64</code></p></li><li><p><code>ubuntu2204/sbsa</code></p></li><li><p><code>ubuntu2204/x86_64</code></p></li><li><p><code>ubuntu2404/sbsa</code></p></li><li><p><code>ubuntu2404/x86_64</code></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Update the APT repository cache:</p><pre><code>sudo apt-get update</code></pre></li><li><p>Install the CUDA SDK:</p><pre><code>sudo apt-get install cuda-toolkit</code></pre></li><li><p>Set up the environment for CUDA by adding its binaries to your PATH:</p><pre><code>export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.6/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}</code></pre></li><li><p>Reboot the system to ensure all configurations take effect:</p><pre><code>sudo reboot</code></pre></li></ol><p><strong>(Optional) Test that CUDA Toolkit Works</strong></p><p>To ensure that your system is correctly configured for GPU acceleration, test the CUDA installation by compiling and running sample programs provided by NVIDIA (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nvidia/cuda-samples">https://github.com/nvidia/cuda-samples</a>).</p><ol><li><p>First, install the necessary build tools:</p><pre><code>sudo apt install build-essential</code></pre></li><li><p>Clone the CUDA sample repository and build the sample projects:</p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/nvidia/cuda-samples
cd cuda-samples
make</code></pre></li><li><p>Navigate to the compiled binaries and run the <code>deviceQuery</code> tool to verify your GPU and CUDA installation:</p><pre><code>cd bin/x86_64/linux/release
./deviceQuery</code></pre><p>You should see detailed information about your GPU and CUDA environment, confirming that the toolkit is working correctly.</p><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/lLmNeOP7HXG0OqaG97wimw/clwdlsohu0000v1qer09du8mo/fba84378-4c3c-4712-9230-ba2476654826.png/public" alt="deviceQuery showing CUDA Capable device(s)"></li></ol><p><strong>Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit</strong></p><p>To enable Docker containers to access your GPU, you'll need to install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit. This toolkit allows Docker to offload GPU-intensive operations to your NVIDIA GPU, essential for speeding up tasks like model inference with Ollama.</p><p>Follow the steps below from <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/r/ollama/ollama">Ollama docker docs</a> to install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Configure the repository</strong>:</p><pre><code>curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey \

			<h2 id="when-personhood-is-decided-by-the-big-five">When “personhood” is decided by the Big Five</h2>
<p>My partner and I recently moved states in order to benefit from lower rent and a
more affordable living environment. We found a place on Craigslist for the
winter that was not only scam-free, but extremely cute. We visited it in person,
met the landlord, and agreed to tenancy until April after the threat of frost.
The process, despite its rushed quality, was rather straightforward.</p>
<p>However, we started running into problems when we began updating our address.
Google, it seemed, never heard of our road let alone the fact that there were
houses on it.</p>
<p>I first noticed this issue when I went to update my address with my online
credit union. I was told, in no uncertain terms that the street didn’t exist
after I overrode the Google Maps autocomplete. When I switched to our PO Box
number, an error message popped up and said that “PO Boxes were not appropriate
addresses.”</p>
<p>And so our saga began.</p>
<p>The town, thankfully, knew of the road and gave us no problems when it came to
hyper-local needs like car registration at the downtown office. Signing up for a
new phone service left us both screaming at the computer, then eventually
settling with putting our address as the post office (because, again, PO boxes
aren’t “appropriate addresses”). We just hoped that the town being small enough
would make it so they would know where to put mail should something ever come
from the phone company or any other service that used Google to verify
addresses.</p>
<p>Getting a license was also difficult, since mail was rarely delivered to our
physical address. Instead, both of us needed to sign an affadavit…to prove
that the other person lived with us or at least wasn’t lying about living in the
state.</p>
<p>Which, when you think about it, is weird, right?</p>
<p>Go in with enough random people to say you lived at a place and that was more
legitimate than a letter with your address on top from a propane company that
served half the state.</p>
<p>The letter, you see, doesn’t count because it wasn’t a bill with the account
number on it, even though the mysterious street address was. But of course new
tenants wouldn’t have a bill with the account number on it yet since they had
only just moved in! Proof of car insurance wasn’t enough either because it only
had our mailing address, which is a PO Box…and well, we know what Serious
Institutions think of PO Boxes.</p>
<p>And while we have figured at least some of this out, we also had difficulty
discerning where to begin. Since, to get the PO Box at all, USPS had to know
where we lived and that we had proof of living in the town we wanted the PO Box
at…which caused a headache with Google Maps autocomplete again. Because of
Google, our address wasn’t even present for the USPS, who should have more say
than Google about what is and isn’t an address! It took a sympathetic postmaster
to help us out in person, since everyone in that office had delivered local mail
to our address previously, so knew we weren’t making things up.</p>
<p>This entire debacle is worth mentioning in as full of detail as possible for two
reasons: (1) It shows the extent to which Google can dictate our lives and how
we get to live it. (2) Proof of address is needed for so many things, down to the
basic necessities to be legal within this country.</p>
<p>If I don’t have an address, I cannot have a bank account. I cannot get a
driver’s license, register my car, vote in my town. I cannot even get a library
card.</p>
<p>For an entire week, I was a non-person to this country’s bureaucracy, which in
some respects <em>should</em> feel freeing, but in the end was a massive pain in the
ass. It was frightening to consider that something as simple as an address not
showing up on the world’s most popular maps app meant that, without the
intervention of locals who understood what it meant to live in a largely
unmarked rural area, this non-personhood would’ve potentially been permanent.</p>
<p>On a larger scale, it made me concerned for the use of AI in these kinds of
situations. What if I wasn’t able to intercept a human postmaster who could then
look at my documents and say that I was able to have a PO Box to receive mail
from outside of town? Or talk to a DMV associate who could see that my partner
was right beside me and could vouch for my legitimacy as a state resident?</p>
<p>Technology, of course, is falliable. It cannot account for all cases, all
possibilities. And forbid the thought of politics entering into it. These tools
can easily be manipulated further to label anyone outside of the white,
heteronormative, cisgender conglomerate as a non-person in the eyes of the
larger system. All they need is a huge company like Google to “not recognize” a
few key factors like whole neighborhoods in redlined areas or a gender marker
(as compared to a birth certificate or something).</p>
<p>If nothing else, I learned that nothing beats talking to a real, live human
being, especially those that are just down the street.</p>

<h2>Many of the country’s richest people, including Elon Musk and Larry Ellison, borrow against their stock while avoiding capital gains taxes.</h2>



<p><abbr>O</abbr><strong>n Saturday, Elon Musk</strong> promised to sell 10% of his Tesla stake after 58% of people voted in a Twitter poll shared by the Tesla CEO. Yesterday, Musk began to follow through, exercising about 2.15 million Tesla stock options and selling shares to cover the taxes he owed as a result. Prior to this week, he has only ever sold Tesla shares twice—in 2010 and 2016—for pre-tax proceeds of $617 million ($593 million of that went to cover taxes he owed on options). Tesla’s stock has risen over 13,000% since his last sale, and Musk is now worth an estimated $281 billion (based on Wednesday’s closing price).&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the world’s richest man wants cash, he can simply borrow money by putting up—or pledging—some of his Tesla shares as collateral for lines of credit, instead of selling shares and paying capital gains taxes. These pledged shares serve as an evergreen credit facility, giving Musk access to cash when he needs it. Musk currently has pledged 88.3 million Tesla shares, nearly 36.2% of his overall stake (excluding options), as of Wednesday worth more than $94 billion.</p>

<p>Musk is one of 32 billionaires identified in the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/" aria-label="Forbes 400">Forbes 400</a> list<em> </em>of richest Americans to be pledging public stock of companies listed on the NYSE or Nasdaq exchanges as collateral for current or potential lines of credit, as disclosed in company filings. Other pledgers include fellow mega-pledger Oracle chairman Larry Ellison, Walmart heir Jim Walton, and private equity’s richest person, Stephen Schwarzman.&nbsp;(Three others pledged shares of foreign companies are not included in this report.)</p>

<p>Across all companies listed on the NYSE and Nasdaq exchanges, there are 560 executive officers and directors and 5%+ shareholders currently pledging shares; the size of the average pledge is $427 million and the aggregate value of these pledged shares is $239 billion, according to a report from Audit Analytics, an independent provider of audit, regulatory and disclosure intelligence. Within this larger group, Forbes 400 members do most of the pledging—value wise, that is. Musk’s Tesla pledge alone is 47% of that aggregate pledged share value. Removing the extreme outlier Musk, the remaining 31 Forbes 400 members account for 56% of that figure. (Data for this report were calculated Nov. 5; Tesla shares are down nearly 13% since then).</p><hr>
<blockquote><p>“At current interest and tax rates, it is far cheaper to borrow against the value of one's shares than to sell them and pay taxes on the gains.”
</p></blockquote><hr>
<p>Information on companies’ pledging policies—found in annual proxy statements—-offer a window into the murky world of billionaire borrowing. The topic entered the national microscope in June after <em>ProPublica’s </em><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax" target="_blank" title="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax" aria-label="report">report</a> on leaked IRS data showed that several of the richest people paid nothing in federal income taxes in certain years. Last month, a proposed wealth tax from Senate Democrat Ron Wyden failed to win political support. That measure would have taxed unrealized capital gains of America’s richest individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most details on billionaire borrowing remain private. Individuals who own less than a 5% stake in a company, or who don’t work for that company, do not report stock ownership or pledging of shares to the SEC. Many of America's wealthiest people—232 billionaires from this year’s Forbes 400 list, to be exact—hold their fortunes primarily in private companies. Any pledges against diversified baskets of stock or private assets are not reported in company filings. Disclosure requirements also do not include reporting whether, or how much, an individual has borrowed against their pledged shares. A few billionaires <em>Forbes </em>contacted said they don’t have outstanding debt against their pledges.&nbsp;</p><fbs-ad position="top" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-top"></fbs-ad>
<p>Most larger companies don’t allow pledging: Over two-thirds (68.4%) of S&amp;P 500 companies ban all company employees and shareholders from pledging shares for debt, 22% prohibit pledging but with exemptions for certain individuals, and only 3.4% fully permit it, according to data provided by proxy advisory firm Institutional Investors Service (ISS). “When executives or directors have a significant percentage of their equity pledged, it creates a concern from the investor perspective,” says Jun Frank, an executive director for ISS’ corporate solutions group, which advises companies on corporate governance matters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those concerns include margin calls: forced sales of pledged shares that can sink a company’s stock price, which risks cascading into a broader, panic-induced selloff. An example: Green Mountain Coffee Roaster’s founder Robert Stiller borrowed against his company shares to fund an increasingly extravagant lifestyle, rather than sell shares. That worked fine when the share price was rising but quickly unraveled after a short-seller called into question its accounting in May 2012. The former billionaire was forced to sell 5 million shares, worth $126 million, in one day to cover margin calls on pledged Green Mountain stock. He was then removed as Chairman of the Board.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pledging can also create friction between directors and executive officers pledging shares and outside shareholders, says Frank: “If you no longer have certain claims to those underlying economic interests and you continue to have the voting right, that creates a mismatch between the control you can exercise over the company and the economic interest you have in the company.”</p><hr>
<h4><strong>THE FORBES 400 PLEDGERS</strong></h4>
<h4>Thirty-two billionaires identified in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/" aria-label="Forbes 400">Forbes 400</a>&nbsp;list<em>&nbsp;</em>of richest Americans have pledged public stock of companies listed on the NYSE or Nasdaq exchanges.</h4><hr>
<p><strong>Sometimes </strong>what company founders want, in this case to pledge shares, is at odds with what board members and shareholders want, which is to disallow pledging. The software company Oracle, for example, adopted a rule in January 2018 prohibiting its directors and executive officers from pledging company shares, although one individual was exempt: Larry Ellison, Oracle’s cofounder and largest individual shareholder. But then, as now, Ellison was the only Oracle director to ever report pledging any company shares. Ellison, who boasts a fortune of over $100 billion, has been pledging shares since at least 2007, after the Securities and Exchange Commission began requiring it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, Oracle’s new pledging policy had no immediate impact on the pledging activity of its directors and executives—Ellison least of all. Since 2018, he has increased the number of his pledged Oracle shares to 317 million — worth about $28 billion — equivalent to roughly 27% of his stake and 11% of all outstanding Oracle stock. Ellison did not sell any Oracle shares between December 2010 and June 2020, a near-decade stretch of big spending for the eccentric billionaire, who splashed $300 million in 2012 to buy the Hawaiian island of Lanai and tens of millions of dollars on opulent mansions, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2021/04/10/inside-larry-ellisons-1-billion-real-estate-portfolio/?sh=36dbf90756e0" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2021/04/10/inside-larry-ellisons-1-billion-real-estate-portfolio/?sh=36dbf90756e0" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2021/04/10/inside-larry-ellisons-1-billion-real-estate-portfolio/?sh=36dbf90756e0" aria-label="growing">growing</a> a $1 billion real estate portfolio that includes at least ten&nbsp; properties on Malibu’s glitzy Carbon Beach.</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-1"></fbs-ad>
<p>While Oracle does not disclose how much Ellison has borrowed against his shares, his penchant for borrowing was revealed in unsealed court documents from a shareholder lawsuit. Those documents, first <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Inside-look-at-a-billionaire-s-budget-Larry-2542603.php" target="_blank" title="https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Inside-look-at-a-billionaire-s-budget-Larry-2542603.php" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Inside-look-at-a-billionaire-s-budget-Larry-2542603.php" aria-label="reported">reported</a> by <em>The San Francisco Chronicle</em> in 2006, showed that Ellison had outstanding loans of more than $1.2 billion in 2001, and that his financial adviser had warned him, “We have a freight train going down a track hitting a debt wall.” (Oracle did not respond to <em>Forbes’ </em>questions<em> </em>about its pledging policy or Ellison’s borrowing.)</p>
<p>Other companies find more creative ways to exempt billionaire founders from pledging bans. Take the oil and gas firm Kinder Morgan, whose prohibition on pledging comes with a caveat: shares owned “in excess of the applicable minimum ownership guidelines'' are able to be pledged. The minimum ownership requirement for directors—such as executive chairman and billionaire Richard Kinder—is <a href="https://www.kindermorgan.com/WWWKM/media/Documents/Governance/Stock_Ownership_Guidelines.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://www.kindermorgan.com/WWWKM/media/Documents/Governance/Stock_Ownership_Guidelines.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.kindermorgan.com/WWWKM/media/Documents/Governance/Stock_Ownership_Guidelines.pdf" aria-label="three times">three times</a> the value of their “annual cash retainer.” Helpfully, Kinder’s annual salary is $1. That means the eponymous cofounder can effectively pledge as many shares as he likes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kinder, whose $7.2 billion fortune makes him the 128th wealthiest American, has pledged 40 million shares of his eponymous company — 15.6% of his overall stake, worth $679 million — for the sole purpose of buying more company stock, as described in the company’s proxy statement. To date, Kinder has purchased 10 million additional shares of Kinder Morgan, financed with debt taken out against his pledged Kinder Morgan shares. A representative for Kinder Morgan confirmed <em>Forbes’ </em>interpretation of its pledging rules but declined to comment further.</p>
<p>Some companies are upfront about their exemptions, but fail to make a convincing argument for them. The medical conglomerate Danaher simply states in its 2021 proxy statement that its sibling founders, Forbes 400 members Steven and Mitchell Rales, are exempt from its pledging ban “because [their] shares had been pledged for decades.” Each brother has pledged a significant portion of their Danaher shares, a potential red flag for margin calls: Steven Rales has pledged 78% of his equity stake (just over $10 billion), and Mitchell has pledged nearly 91% of his equity stake (slightly under $10 billion). Together, their pledges are 9.4% of all outstanding Danaher stock. (Danaher and the Rales brothers did not respond to requests for comment).</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-2"></fbs-ad>
<p>Of the Forbes 400 billionaires, oil mogul George Kaiser (net worth: $10.7 billion) has the highest ratio of pledged shares to the company’s total outstanding common stock — another red flag for margin calls. His pledge of 21 million shares of bank holding company BOK Financial Corporation (worth nearly $2.3 billion) is equal to nearly 31% of all outstanding stock. But Kaiser says he only occasionally borrows against those pledged shares. “They are just low cost, back-up lines, which we have had in place for a long time and infrequently use,” he told <em>Forbes</em> over email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tesla argues that pledging creates a kind of fiduciary relationship between pledgers and shareholders. In 2018 the electric carmaker introduced a 25% loan-to-value limit on borrowing against pledged shares, arguing that pledging gives “executive officers flexibility in financial planning without having to rely on large cash compensation or the sale of Company shares, thus keeping their interests well aligned with those of our stockholders, while also mitigating risk exposure to the Company” — a stance Tesla has reiterated in subsequent proxy filings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ISS countered this argument in its recent proxy analysis of Tesla’s corporate governance principles. “If an executive who already owns 15 or 20 percent of a company's outstanding shares...is not already motivated to act in the interests of shareholders, there is no credible argument that increasing that stake to 25 or 30 percent will suffice to accomplish that goal,” says the report. “Perhaps a more salient, though unspoken, factor is that at current interest and tax rates, it is far cheaper to borrow against the value of one's shares than to sell them and pay taxes on the gains.”</p><fbs-ad position="topx" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-topx-3"></fbs-ad>
<p>So just how prevalent is pledging assets to borrow among the ultra rich? “Pretty high,” responds Jason Cain, a managing director and chief wealth strategist at advisory firm Boston Private, speaking about his firm's highest bracket of clients: those with above $500 million in assets. (Cain declined to provide an exact percentage figure). “It's not any different than families... who borrow for homes” and other life purchases, says Cain. “Most of these clients are aware of the uses of debt and with interest rates where they have been in the recent past, they understand the arbitrage opportunity.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ali Jamal, and ex-Julius Baer banker and founder of Azura, a boutique wealth management firm for billionaire entrepreneurs, says that during the stock market crash of March 2020, about 70% of Azura’s clients took on leverage — by pledging shares, but also artwork and car collections — to take on debt to buy more stock. And over the past year, about 40% of Azura clients have leveraged their way into special purpose acquisition corporations. “You can borrow at 40 basis points, max 50 basis points, to have someone very smart” identify an investment opportunity, says Jamal about the appeal of leveraging into SPACs, “and if you don't like the opportunity, you can pull your money out.”</p>
<p>Borrowing against one’s shares has its risks, but for these billionaires, the rewards seem to outweigh them. “It’s perfectly legal, and it's a little hard to say it's immoral. Like, it's immoral to own a growth stock? It's immoral to borrow money?” says Edward McCaffrey, a tax law professor at USC Gould School of Law who coined the popular term “Buy, Borrow, Die” to describe how the ultra-wealthy borrow to avoid paying taxes. “So the question is, why would anybody not do it?</p>

<p>Graphite is designed principally as a desktop-grade professional application that is also accessible in-browser for fast, casual usage.</p>
<p>Where's the download? Desktop apps for Windows, Mac, and Linux should be available later in 2024. Until then, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361" target="_blank">install it as a PWA</a>.</p>
<p>Developing and maintaining a native app on four platforms is a big task. To not compromise on the optimal desktop experience—which takes longer to do the right way—priorities called for initially supporting just web, the one platform that stays up-to-date and reaches all devices.</p>
<p>Once it's ready to shine, Graphite's code architecture is structured to deliver native performance for your graphically intensive workloads on desktop platforms and very low overhead on the web thanks to WebAssembly and WebGPU, new high-performance browser technologies.</p>

<div id="proceduralism">
<div>

<hr>
<p>Graphite is the first and only graphic design package built for procedural editing — where everything is nondestructive.</p>
</div>
<div>

<p>Save hours on tedious alterations and make better creative choices. Graphite lets you iterate rapidly by adjusting node parameters instead of individual elements.</p>
<p>Scatter circles with just a couple nodes...<br>
Want them denser? Bigger? Those are sliders.<br>
Want a different placement area? Just tweak the path.</p>
<p><a href="https://editor.graphite.rs/#demo/red-dress">Open this artwork</a> and give it a try yourself.</p>
</div>
<div>

<p>Nondestructive editing means every decision is tied to a parameter you can adjust later on. Use Graphite to interpolate between any states just by dragging sliders.</p>
<p>Blend across color schemes. Morph shapes before they're scattered around the canvas. The possibilities are endless.</p>

Awnings. They were ubiquitous over nearly every window of buildings from the most basic single family home to massive buildings like The White House.</p> <p>Where did all these awnings go and why did they disappear? Before we answer that let’s look at what an awning actually does for a building.</p> <h2>How Do Awnings Work?</h2> <p>Awnings were and still are extremely effective at blocking solar heat gain through windows. We often look at builders from the 19th century with a pitying condescension like they just weren’t as smart as we are today. To me it’s really despicable the lack of respect we give these incredibly talented contractors who were able to design and construct these solid structures that have withstood the test of time without the use of computers, power tools, or energy codes.</p> <div> <figure><img width="500" height="384" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://cdn-adeaj.nitrocdn.com/izJGWTXvtlwmDhipoFmdgKSxsmoFktuh/assets/images/optimized/rev-7b52977/thecraftsmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/E8523F4B-C6C7-43B7-8262-BC10D21A60DC.jpeg 500w, https://cdn-adeaj.nitrocdn.com/izJGWTXvtlwmDhipoFmdgKSxsmoFktuh/assets/images/optimized/rev-7b52977/thecraftsmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/E8523F4B-C6C7-43B7-8262-BC10D21A60DC-300x230.jpeg 300w, https://cdn-adeaj.nitrocdn.com/izJGWTXvtlwmDhipoFmdgKSxsmoFktuh/assets/images/optimized/rev-7b52977/thecraftsmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/E8523F4B-C6C7-43B7-8262-BC10D21A60DC-78x60.jpeg 78w, https://cdn-adeaj.nitrocdn.com/izJGWTXvtlwmDhipoFmdgKSxsmoFktuh/assets/images/optimized/rev-7b52977/thecraftsmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/E8523F4B-C6C7-43B7-8262-BC10D21A60DC-150x115.jpeg 150w" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-adeaj.nitrocdn.com/izJGWTXvtlwmDhipoFmdgKSxsmoFktuh/assets/images/optimized/rev-7b52977/thecraftsmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/E8523F4B-C6C7-43B7-8262-BC10D21A60DC.jpeg" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDM4NCIgd2lkdGg9IjUwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIzODQiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+"></figure></div> <p>They built these structures with incredibly clever passive heating and cooling systems like the <a href="https://thecraftsmanblog.com/why-are-there-double-hung-windows/">double-hung window</a>, making the best of the technological limitations of their day to create buildings that could keep people relatively comfortably even in extreme temperatures and awnings were a major part of that.</p> <p>Awnings work by covering the top portion of window and thereby blocking the high summer sun from pouring into the window and heating the room. Since in the winter the sun is lower in the sky the awning, when positioned and sized properly, allows the winter sun into the room to warm things up.</p> <p>No adjusting, no tweaking, just completely passive heating in the winter and cooling in the summer by a thoughtful design. The metal frame could last for decades without needing changing, and the fabric covering would need to be replaced every 8-10 years depending on exposure and climate.</p> <div> <figure><img width="568" height="450" alt="white house awnings" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://cdn-adeaj.nitrocdn.com/izJGWTXvtlwmDhipoFmdgKSxsmoFktuh/assets/images/optimized/rev-7b52977/thecraftsmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/7AABF1AE-48DC-41C8-A6ED-059779EBE270.webp 568w, https://cdn-adeaj.nitrocdn.com/izJGWTXvtlwmDhipoFmdgKSxsmoFktuh/assets/images/optimized/rev-7b52977/thecraftsmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/7AABF1AE-48DC-41C8-A6ED-059779EBE270-300x238.webp 300w, https://cdn-adeaj.nitrocdn.com/izJGWTXvtlwmDhipoFmdgKSxsmoFktuh/assets/images/optimized/rev-7b52977/thecraftsmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/7AABF1AE-48DC-41C8-A6ED-059779EBE270-76x60.webp 76w, https://cdn-adeaj.nitrocdn.com/izJGWTXvtlwmDhipoFmdgKSxsmoFktuh/assets/images/optimized/rev-7b52977/thecraftsmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/7AABF1AE-48DC-41C8-A6ED-059779EBE270-150x119.webp 150w" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-adeaj.nitrocdn.com/izJGWTXvtlwmDhipoFmdgKSxsmoFktuh/assets/images/optimized/rev-7b52977/thecraftsmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/7AABF1AE-48DC-41C8-A6ED-059779EBE270.webp" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTY4IDQ1MCIgd2lkdGg9IjU2OCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI0NTAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+"></figure></div> <h2>Why Awnings Disappeared</h2> <p>So where did all the awnings go? Two simple words…air conditioning. Before the widespread adoption of air conditioning, awnings were the preferred way to keep buildings cooler. But just because we invented AC does that mean we don’t need the help that awnings provide?</p> <p>In the middle of the 20th century as air conditioning was gradually installed in homes across America, awnings came down or wore out and were not replaced because now we had the technology to mechanically cool our buildings.</p> <p>Energy costs were relatively cheap in those decades and one generation later when energy prices jumped up during the 1970s people seemed to have forgotten about awnings for energy savings. We jumped into the insulation craze and began stuffing fiberglass into every wall and ceiling as fast as possible, forgetting what our fathers and grandfathers knew to be true. If you kept the sun out of the windows you could keep the heat out of the building.</p> <p>Today, awnings are mainly used as signage for storefronts and coverings to keep rain off of customers. Retractable awnings to cover decks and patios have picked up in the ensuing decades and remain a market for manufacturers, but the days of covering individual windows with awnings have gone away.</p> <p>In this age of increasing energy prices, I’m hopeful the awning will swing back into popularity since it is an extremely simple way to keep temperatures moderated throughout the year. Time will tell. How about you? Would you consider adding awnings to your house to keep your heating and cooling costs down? If not then why?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>At the Open Compute Project (OCP) Global Summit 2024, we’re showcasing our latest open AI hardware designs with the OCP community.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>These innovations include a new AI platform, cutting-edge open rack designs, and advanced network fabrics and components.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>By sharing our designs, we hope to inspire collaboration and foster innovation. If you’re passionate about building the future of AI, we invite you to engage with us and OCP to help shape the next generation of open hardware for AI.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>AI has been at the core of the experiences Meta has been delivering to people and businesses for years, including AI modeling innovations to optimize and improve on features like </span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/facebook-feed-improvements-ai-show-more-less/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Feed</span></a><span> and our </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/07/10/data-infrastructure/machine-learning-ml-prediction-robustness-meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>ads system</span></a><span>. As we develop and release new, advanced AI models, we are also driven to advance our infrastructure to support our new and emerging AI workloads.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, </span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Llama 3.1 405B</span></a><span>, Meta’s largest model, is a dense transformer with 405B parameters and a context window of up to 128k tokens. To train a large language model (LLM) of this magnitude, with over 15 trillion tokens, we had to make substantial optimizations to our entire training stack. This effort pushed our infrastructure to operate across more than 16,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, making Llama 3.1 405B the first model in the Llama series to be trained at such a massive scale.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Prior to Llama, our largest AI jobs ran on 128 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. ​But things have rapidly accelerated. ​Over the course of 2023, we rapidly scaled up our training clusters from 1K, 2K, 4K, to eventually 16K GPUs to support our AI workloads. Today, we’re training our models on two</span> <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/12/data-center-engineering/building-metas-genai-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>24K-GPU clusters</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>We don’t expect this upward trajectory for AI clusters to slow down any time soon. In fact, we expect the amount of compute needed for AI training will grow significantly from where we are today.</span></p>
<p><span>Building AI clusters requires more than just GPUs. Networking and bandwidth play an important role in ensuring the clusters’ performance. Our systems consist of a tightly integrated HPC compute system and an isolated high-bandwidth compute network that connects all our GPUs and domain-specific accelerators. This design is necessary to meet our injection needs and address the challenges posed by our need for bisection bandwidth.</span></p>
<p><span>In the next few years, we anticipate greater injection bandwidth on the order of a terabyte per second, per accelerator, with equal normalized bisection bandwidth. This represents a growth of more than an order of magnitude compared to today’s networks!</span></p>
<p><span>To support this growth, we need a high-performance, multi-tier, non-blocking network fabric that can utilize modern congestion control to behave predictably under heavy load. This will enable us to fully leverage the power of our AI clusters and ensure they continue to perform optimally as we push the boundaries of what is possible with AI.</span></p>
<p><span>Scaling AI at this speed requires open hardware solutions. Developing new architectures, network fabrics, and system designs is the most efficient and impactful when we can build it on principles of openness. By investing in open hardware, we unlock AI’s full potential and propel ongoing innovation in the field.</span></p>
<h2><span>Introducing Catalina: Open Architecture for AI Infra</span></h2>
<figure id="attachment_21841" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-21841"><img decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2050/05/Catalina-Front-Back-2.png?w=683" alt="" width="456" height="683" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2050/05/Catalina-Front-Back-2.png 720w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2050/05/Catalina-Front-Back-2.png?resize=611,916 611w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2050/05/Catalina-Front-Back-2.png?resize=683,1024 683w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2050/05/Catalina-Front-Back-2.png?resize=96,144 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2050/05/Catalina-Front-Back-2.png?resize=192,288 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-21841">Catalina front view (left) and rear view (right).</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Today, we announced the upcoming release of Catalina, our new high-powered rack designed for AI workloads, to the OCP community. Catalina is based on the <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-contributes-blackwell-platform-design-to-open-hardware-ecosystem-accelerating-ai-infrastructure-innovation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Blackwell platform full rack-scale solution</a>, with a focus on modularity and flexibility. It is built to support the latest NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip, ensuring it meets the growing demands of modern AI infrastructure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The growing power demands of GPUs means open rack solutions need to support higher power capability. With Catalina we’re introducing the Orv3, a high-power rack (HPR) capable of supporting up to 140kW.</span></p>
<p><span>The full solution is liquid cooled and consists of a power shelf that supports a compute tray, switch tray, the Orv3 HPR, the</span> <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/11/09/data-center-engineering/ocp-summit-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Wedge 400</span></a><span> fabric switch, a management switch, battery backup unit, and a rack management controller.</span></p>
<p><span>We aim for Catalina’s modular design to empower others to customize the rack to meet their specific AI workloads while leveraging both existing and emerging industry standards.</span></p>
<h2><span>The Grand Teton Platform now supports AMD accelerators</span></h2>

<p><span>In 2022, we announced </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/10/18/open-source/ocp-summit-2022-grand-teton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Grand Teton</span></a><span>, our next-generation AI platform (the follow-up to our Zion-EX platform). Grand Teton is designed with compute capacity to support the demands of memory-bandwidth-bound workloads, such as Meta’s <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/dlrm-an-advanced-open-source-deep-learning-recommendation-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep learning recommendation models (</a></span><span>DLRMs</span><span>), as well as compute-bound workloads like content understanding.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, we have expanded the Grand Teton platform to support the AMD Instinct MI300X and will be contributing this new version to OCP. Like its predecessors, this new version of Grand Teton</span><span>&nbsp;features a single monolithic system design with fully integrated power, control, compute, and fabric interfaces. This high level of integration simplifies system deployment, enabling rapid scaling with increased reliability for large-scale AI inference workloads.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to supporting a range of accelerator designs, now including the AMD Instinct MI300x, Grand Teton offers significantly greater compute capacity, allowing faster convergence on a larger set of weights. This is complemented by expanded memory to store and run larger models locally, along with increased network bandwidth to scale up training cluster sizes efficiently.</span></p>
<h2><span>​Open Disaggregated Scheduled Fabric&nbsp;</span></h2>

<p><span>Developing open, vendor-agnostic networking backend is going to play an important role going forward as we continue to push the performance of our AI training clusters. Disaggregating our network allows us to work with vendors from across the industry to design systems that are innovative as well as scalable, flexible, and efficient.</span></p>
<p><span>Our new <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/10/15/data-infrastructure/open-future-networking-hardware-ai-ocp-2024-meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disaggregated Scheduled Fabric (DSF)</a> for our next-generation AI clusters offers several advantages over our existing switches. By opening up our network fabric we can overcome limitations in scale, component supply options, and power density. DSF is powered by the open</span><a href="https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span> OCP-SAI</span></a><span> standard and</span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2018/09/04/data-infrastructure/research-in-brief-building-switch-software-at-scale-and-in-the-open/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span> FBOSS</span></a><span>, Meta’s own network operating system for controlling network switches. It also supports an open and standard Ethernet-based RoCE interface to endpoints and accelerators across several GPUS and NICS from several different vendors, including our partners at NVIDIA, Broadcom, and AMD.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to DSF, we have also developed and built new 51T fabric switches based on Broadcom and Cisco ASICs. Finally, we are sharing our new FBNIC, a new NIC module that contains our first Meta-design network ASIC. In order to meet the growing needs of our AI&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Meta and Microsoft: Driving Open Innovation Together</span></h2>
<p><span>Meta and Microsoft have a long-standing partnership within OCP, beginning with the development of the </span><a href="https://www.opencompute.org/documents/switch-abstraction-interface-ocp-specification-v0-2-pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Switch Abstraction Interface (SAI)</span></a><span> for data centers in 2018. Over the years together, we’ve contributed to key initiatives such as the </span><a href="https://www.opencompute.org/blog/new-open-accelerator-infrastructure-oai-sub-project-to-launch-within-the-ocp-server-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Open Accelerator Module (OAM)</span></a><span> standard and SSD standardization, showcasing our shared commitment to advancing open innovation.</span></p>
<p><span>Our current </span><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/accelerating-industry-wide-innovations-in-datacenter-infrastructure-and-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>collaboration focuses on Mount Diablo</span></a><span>, a new disaggregated power rack. It’s a cutting-edge solution featuring a scalable 400 VDC unit that enhances efficiency and scalability. This innovative design allows more AI accelerators per IT rack, significantly advancing AI infrastructure. We’re excited to continue our collaboration through this contribution.</span></p>
<h2><span>The open future of AI infra</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/open-source-ai-is-the-path-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Meta is committed to open source AI</span></a><span>. We believe that open source will put the benefits and opportunities of AI into the hands of people all over the word.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>AI won’t realize its full potential without collaboration. We need open software frameworks to drive model innovation, ensure portability, and promote transparency in AI development. We must also prioritize open and standardized models so we can leverage collective expertise, make AI more accessible, and work towards minimizing biases in our systems.​</span></p>
<p><span>Just as important, we also need open AI hardware systems. These systems are necessary for delivering the kind of high-performance, cost-effective, and adaptable infrastructure necessary for AI advancement.​</span></p>
<p><span>We encourage anyone who wants to help advance the future of AI hardware systems to engage with the OCP community. By addressing AI’s infrastructure needs together, we can unlock the true promise of open AI for everyone.​</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The shape of the x86 instruction set architecture (ISA) is evolving. On Tuesday, Intel and AMD announced the formation of an ecosystem advisory group intended to drive greater consistency between the brands' x86 implementations.</p>
<p>Intel and AMD have been co-developing the x86-64 instruction for decades. But while end user workloads have enjoyed cross-compatibility between the two chipmakers' products, this has been far from universal.</p>
<p>"x86 is the de facto standard. It's a strong ecosystem, but it's one that really Intel and AMD have co-developed in a way, but an arm's length, and you know, that has caused some inefficiencies and some drift in portions of the ISA over time." AMD EVP of datacenter solutions Forrest Norrod said during a press briefing ahead of the announcement.</p>

    

<p>The introduction of advanced vector extensions (AVX) is the most obvious example of where compatibility across Intel and AMD platforms hasn't always been guaranteed.</p>

        


        

<p>For many years, those who wanted to take advantage of fat 512-bit vector registers have been limited to Intel platforms. In fact, AMD lacked support for AVX-512 until the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/10/amd_96core_epyc/">launch</a> of Zen 4 in 2022, and even then it only supported it by double pumping a 256-bit data path. It wasn't until this year's Zen 5 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/15/amd_spills_the_beans_on/">launch</a> the House of Zen added support for a full 512-bit data path.</p>
<p>Going forward, Intel, AMD, and their industry partners aim to avoid this kind of inconsistency by converging around a more uniform implementation. To support this goal, the duo has solicited the help of Broadcom, Dell, Google, HPE, HP, Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, Red Hat, as well as individuals, including Linux kernel-dev Linus Torvalds and Epic's Tim Sweeney.</p>

        

<p>This advisory group will be tasked with reshaping the x86 ISA to improve cross-compatibility, simplify software development, and address changing demands around emerging technologies.</p>
<p>"We'll have, not only will we have the benefits of performance, flexibility and compatibility across hardware, we'll have it across software, operating systems and a variety of services," Intel EVP of datacenter and AI group Justin Hotard told us.</p>
<p>"I think this will actually enable greater choice in the fundamental products, but reduce the friction of being able to choose from those choices," echoed Norrod.</p>

        

<p>However, it'll be some time before we see the group's influence realized in products. Norrod emphasized that silicon development can take months if not years. As such it's "not something that's going to reflect into products, I don't believe, in the next year or so."</p>
<p>For end users, the benefits are numerous as in theory taking advantage of either Intel or AMD's products will require less specialization, something we're sure the hyperscalers will appreciate.</p>
<p>For the long-time rivals, however, the change could have major implications for the future development of the architecture. While the two chipmakers have caught up with each other on vector extensions, Intel still has its advanced matrix extensions (AMX) for CPU-based AI inference acceleration.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether these extensions will be phased out or if some version of them will eventually make their way into AMD's Epyc and Ryzen processors. We have no doubt that either team's SoC designers would relish the opportunity to reclaim all that die area currently consumed by the NPU.</p>
<p>"I don't think we want to commit to 'we're going to support this or not support this' in a time frame. But I think the intent is we want to support things consistently," Hotard said.</p>
<p>While Norrod and Hotard declined to comment on specific changes coming to x86, recent developments, particularly on Intel's side, give us some idea of the ISA's trajectory.</p>
<p>In June, Intel published an update to its proposed <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/envisioning-future-simplified-architecture.html">x86S spec</a>, a stripped down version of the ISA free of legacy bloat — most notably 32-bit and 16-bit execution modes. As we understand it, 32-bit code would still be able to run, albeit in a compatibility mode.</p>
<p>There's also the AVX10 spec that we <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/15/avx10_intel_interviews/">looked at</a> last year, which made many of AVX512's more attractive functions. Under the new spec, AVX10 compatible chips will, for the most part, share a common feature set — including 32 registers, k-masks, and FP16 support — and minimally support 256 bit wide registers.</p>
<p>AVX10 is important for Intel which has transitioned to a dual-stack Xeon roadmap with P-and E-core CPUs, like Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest, the latter of which lacks support for AVX512.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/10/amd_epyc_turin/">AMD pumps Epyc core count to 192, clocks up to 5 GHz with Turin debut</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/15/samsung_hb3me/">Samsung's HBM3E has been a disaster, but there's a path back</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/24/intel_xeon_6p/">With Granite Rapids, Intel is back to trading blows with AMD</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/19/sifive_ai_accelerator/">SiFive expands from RISC-V cores for AI chips to designing its own full-fat accelerator</a></li>
</ul>
<p>AMD's dense Zen C-cores don't suffer from this limitation, but can be switched to a double pumped 256-bit data path to achieve lower power AVX512 support. Whether Intel will push ahead with AVX10 or borrow AMD's implementation under the newly formed advisory group is another unknown, but given enough time, we can expect the two chipmakers to coalesce around a common implementation whether it be AVX, AMX or something else.</p>
<p>That's assuming, of course, that Intel and AMD can agree on how to address industry needs.</p>
<p>With that said, a more consistent ISA could help stave off the growing number of Arm-compatible CPUs finding homes in cloud datacenters. While the exact cores used by these chips may differ — most use Arm's Neoverse cores, but some, like Ampere have developed their own — most are using either the older ARMv8 or ARMv9 ISAs, ensuring that with few exceptions code developed on one should run without issue on the other. ®</p>

<p>The C23 edition of Modern C is now available for free download from</p>



<p><a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02383654">https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02383654</a></p>



<div><p>This new edition has been the occasion to overhaul the presentation in many places, but its main purpose is the update to the new C standard, <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/82075.html">C23</a>. The goal was to publish this new edition of Modern C at the same time as the new C standard goes through the procedure of ISO publication. The closest approximation of the contents of the new standard in a publically available document can be found <a href="https://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n3220.pdf">here</a>. New releases of major compilers already implement most of the new features that it brings.</p>
<p>Among the most noticeable changes and additions that we handle are those for integers: there are new bit-precise types coined <code>_BitInt(N)</code>, new C library headers <code>(for arithmetic with overflow check) and</code> (for bit manipulation), possibilities for 128 bit types on modern architectures, and substantial improvements for enumeration types. Other new concepts in C23 include a <code>nullptr</code> constant and its underlying type, syntactic annotation with attributes, more tools for type generic programming such as type inference with <code>auto</code> and <code>typeof</code>, default initialization with <code>{}</code>, even for variable length arrays, and <code>constexpr</code> for named constants of any type. Furthermore, new material has been added, discussing compound expressions and lambdas, so-called “internationalization”, a comprehensive approach for program failure.</p>
<p>Also added has been an appendix and a temporary include header for an easy transition to C23 on existing platforms, that will allow you to start off with C23 right away.</p>
<p>Manning’s early access program (MEAP) for the new edition is still open at</p>
<p><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/modern-c-third-edition" rel="nofollow">https://www.manning.com/books/modern-c-third-edition</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately they were not yet able to tell me when their version of the C23 edition will finally be published.</p>

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>The new iPad mini gets a major update with A17 Pro, delivering incredible performance and power efficiency in an ultraportable design. A17 Pro is a powerful chip that unlocks a number of improvements over A15 Bionic in the previous-generation iPad mini. With a 6-core CPU — two performance cores and four efficiency cores — A17 Pro delivers a 30 percent boost in CPU performance.<sup>1</sup> A17 Pro also brings a boost in graphics performance with a 5-core GPU, delivering a 25 percent jump over the previous generation.<sup>1</sup> A17 Pro brings entirely new experiences — including pro apps used by designers, pilots, doctors, and others — and makes it faster than ever for users to edit photos, dive into more immersive AR applications, and more. The new iPad mini brings true-to-life gaming with hardware-accelerated ray tracing — which is 4x faster than software-based ray tracing — as well as support for Dynamic Caching and hardware-accelerated mesh shading. From creating engaging content faster than ever in Affinity Designer, to playing demanding, graphics-intensive AAA games like Zenless Zone Zero, users can take the powerful performance and ultraportable iPad mini anywhere.

                 <div><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/" target="_blank">Apple Pencil Pro</a> unlocks magical capabilities and powerful interactions, turning iPad mini into a sketchbook users can take anywhere. Apple Pencil Pro can sense a user’s squeeze, bringing up a tool palette to quickly switch tools, line weights, and colors, all without interrupting the creative process. A custom haptic engine delivers a light tap that provides confirmation when users squeeze, double-tap, or snap to a Smart Shape for a remarkably intuitive experience. Users can roll Apple Pencil Pro for precise control of the tool they’re using. Rotating the barrel changes the orientation of shaped pen and brush tools, just like pen and paper, and with Apple Pencil hover, users can visualize the exact orientation of a tool before making a mark. Apple Pencil Pro features support for Find My, and pairs, charges, and is stored through a new magnetic interface on the new iPad mini. iPad mini also supports Apple Pencil (USB-C), ideal for note taking, sketching, annotating, journaling, and more, at a great value.

Combining the activity of thousands of species of insects with other data like climate, acoustic, or soil analysis, can provide deep analysis into how environments can be repaired.</p><h3 id="offer-highly-localized-insights"> <a href="#offer-highly-localized-insights" aria-labelledby="offer-highly-localized-insights"></a> Offer Highly Localized Insights</h3><p>Because they tend to have short lives and often limited ranges, insects can provide super localized data. Moths, in particular, are great indicators of overall biodiversity because they are often host-specific as caterpillars. This means they only feed on one or a limited number of plant species. So, by monitoring moths, you are getting a proxy of the local plant community.</p><p>For comparison, think about something like a Jaguar, which is a rare find and scientifically valuable to see on a wildlife camera, but they have large ranges and long lives. The presence of a Jaguar does not necessarily tell us much about the health of the environment where it was spotted. It could simply be travelling across disturbed farmland to escape from a destroyed habitat elsewhere.</p><p>Having an insect sensor (like a Mothbox), however, that could compare the activity of thousands of different species of insects can highlight differences in environmental health in areas just a couple kilometers apart.</p><h3 id="they-are-easy-to-attract"> <a href="#they-are-easy-to-attract" aria-labelledby="they-are-easy-to-attract"></a> They are Easy to Attract</h3><p>Humans have long ago discovered that many nocturnal insects like Moths seem to be attracted to lights. We now know this is because <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44785-3">bright lights disorient their natural steering mechanism</a>. Scientists have used bright artificial lights for over a century now to take censuses of insect populations. The problem with this type of “Mothlighting” is that it can be incredibly time consuming (a scientist has to hang out all night and note which insects are visiting). Instead we have an automated device that does all this work for you!</p><h2 id="what-it-does"> <a href="#what-it-does" aria-labelledby="what-it-does"></a> What it Does</h2><p>The Mothbox stays in an ultra low-power state until your schedule tells it which nights to wake up. Then it triggers an insect lure (usually a bright UV light) and then takes ultra-high resolution photos of the visitors it attracts. <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb7f6a03-849b-4b2a-99b9-9580aa245816" alt="PXL_20240607_025924783 NIGHT-EDIT"></p><p>Next we created some open-source AI scripts that process these insects for you.

</figure><p>Put aside the hype about the growing number of us who are likely to make it to 100, because the rise in human life expectancy might actually be slowing down. At least, according to a study that analysed mortality data for ten countries or regions over the past three decades<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><p>“There are limits to how far out we can push out the envelope of human survival,” says study co-author S. Jay Olshansky, an epidemiologist at the University of Illinois Chicago. “If you live long enough, you run up against the biological process of ageing.”</p><p>The era of what he calls radical life extension is over, he argues. Some researchers, however, disagree and point out that medical science could yet find a way to push age limits.</p><p>Advances in public health and medicine during the twentieth century increased human life expectancy to about three years per decade. But Olshansky and others have long argued that this rate of improvement is not sustainable, despite more-optimistic forecasts that predict most children born in the twenty-first century would live for a 100 years or more<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>. But this is difficult to confirm, because the only way to be sure is to wait for enough people to die, or not.</p><p>With his colleagues, Olshansky first published the idea<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup> that human life expectancy has a finite limit in 1990. “We have waited 30 years to test this,” he says. “And we now have definitive evidence that the limited lifespan hypothesis is correct.”</p><p>That evidence is based on the numbers of reported deaths in parts of the world with some of the highest current life expectancies, including Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Australia, France, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, the United States and Spain. The analysis looked at the period of 1990 to 2019, to avoid the distorting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The team found that the rate of improvement in life expectancy in the decade of 2010–19 had dropped below that seen between 1990 and 2000. People were still living longer, but not by as much. In fact, in every population except those of Hong Kong and South Korea, the decadal rise in life expectancy decelerated to below two years.</p><p>Overall, the study found that children born since 2010 have a relatively small chance of living to 100 (5.1% chance for women and 1.8% chance for men). The most likely cohort to see a full century are women in Hong Kong, with a 12.8% chance.</p><h2>Can we overcome ageing?</h2><p>It’s clear that further extension of the average lifespan is difficult because that would require researchers to find treatments for illnesses that affect older people, says Dmitri Jdanov, a demographer at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany. Jdanov wrote, together with his colleague Domantas Jasilionis, an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00722-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00722-z" data-track-category="body text link">accompanying commentary on the paper</a>. Both articles are published in <i>Nature Aging</i> today.</p><p>But Jdanov thinks that Olshansky is too pessimistic about possible progress. “Although making another leap might be difficult, the rapid development of new technologies may lead to an unexpected health revolution,” he says.</p><p>A century ago, few researchers would have thought that child mortality could be reduced considerably, he says. But advances in vaccines, education and public health have since slashed the rate from more than 20% in 1950 to less than 4% now.</p><p>“If we cannot imagine something, it doesn’t mean that it’s impossible,” Jdanov says.</p><p>The study also revealed what Olshansky calls a “shocking” decline in the average life expectancy in the United States in the decade starting in 2010 — a trend seen in such a long-lived population only after extreme events, such as war, since 1900. The decline in the United States is driven by increasing numbers of deaths because of conditions such as diabetes and heart disease in people aged roughly 40 to 60.</p><p>“It tells you that something pretty negative is happening among some subgroups of the population to drag the average down, because the wealthier, more highly educated subgroups are actually doing better,” Olshansky says.</p>
