<h2 id="in-hindsight">In Hindsight</h2>
<p>Growing up, I never stuck to a single thing, be it guitar lessons, art school, martial arts ‚Äì I tried them all. when it came to programming, though, I never really tinkered. I was always amazed with video games and wondered how they were made but I never pursued that curiosity.</p>
<p>My tinkering habits picked up very late, and now I cannot go by without picking up new things in one form or another. It‚Äôs how I learn. I wish I did it sooner. It‚Äôs a major part of my learning process now, and I would never be the <s>programmer</s> person I am today.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-hell-is-tinkering">What the hell is tinkering?</h2>
<p>Have you ever spent hours tweaking the mouse sensitivity in your favorite FPS game?</p>
<p>Have you ever installed a Linux distro, spent days configuring window managers, not because you had to, but purely because it gave you satisfaction and made your workflow exactly yours?</p>
<p>Ever pulled apart your mechanical keyboard, swapped keycaps, tested switches, and lubed stabilizers just for more thock?</p>
<p>That is what I mean.</p>
<p>I have come to understand that there are two kinds of people, those who do things only if it helps them achieve a goal, and those who do things just because. The ideal, of course, is to be a mix of both.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when you tinker and throw away, that‚Äôs practice, and practice should inherently be ephemeral, exploratory, and be frequent - <a href="https://x.com/ludwigABAP/status/1842366186824032737"><span data-cites="ludwigABAP">@ludwigABAP</span></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="my-approach-to-tinkering">My approach to tinkering</h2>
<p>There are plenty of people who still use the VSCode terminal as their default terminal, do not know what vim bindings are, GitHub desktop rather than the cli (at the very least). I‚Äôm not saying these are bad things necessarily, just that this should be the minimum, not the median.</p>
<p>This does not mean I spend every waking hour fiddling with my neovim config. In fact, the last meaningful change to my config was 6 months ago. Finding that balance is where most people fail.</p>
<p>Over the years I have done so many things that in hindsight have made me appreciate programming more but were completely ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù in the strict sense.</p>
<p>In the past week I have, for the first time, written a glsl fragment shader, a rust procedural macro, template c++, a swift app, furthered my hatred for windows development (this is not new), and started using the helix editor more (mainly for good defaults + speed). I didn‚Äôt have to do these things, but I did, for fun! And I know more about these things now.</p>
<p>No time spent learning, is time wasted.</p>
<h2 id="why-taste-matters-especially-now">Why taste matters, especially now</h2>
<p>Acquiring good taste comes through using various things, discarding the ones you don‚Äôt like and keeping the ones you do. if you never try various things, you will not acquire good taste.</p>
<p>And what I mean by taste here is simply the honed ability to distinguish mediocrity from excellence. This will be highly subjective, and not everyone‚Äôs taste will be the same, but that is the point, you should NOT have the same taste as someone else.</p>
<p>Question the status quo, experiment, break things, do this several times, do this everyday and keep doing it.</p>

<p>We are coming up on five years since the first M1 Macs shipped. It was an incredible time to be a Mac user. Those first Apple silicon Macs <em>looked</em> like the Intel machines they replaced, but they were better in every single way.</p>
<p>In December 2020, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/12/m1_macs_truth_and_truthiness">John Gruber wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We knew this to be true: Computers could run fast and hot, or slow and cool. For laptops in particular, the best you could hope for is a middle ground: fast enough and cool enough. But if you wanted a machine that ran really fast, it wasn‚Äôt going to run cool (and wasn‚Äôt going to last long on battery), and if you wanted a computer that ran cool (and lasted long on battery), it wasn‚Äôt going to be fast.</p>
<p>  We knew this to be true because that was the way things were. But now, with the M1 Macs, it‚Äôs not. M1 Macs run very fast and do so while remaining very cool and lasting mind-bogglingly long on battery. It was a fundamental trade-off inherent to PC computing, and now we don‚Äôt have to make it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite its Touch Bar, I immediately bought that first M1 MacBook Pro, and when the 14-inch MacBook Pro came out a year later, I moved to it.<sup id="fnref-34213-fn-14mbp"><a href="#fn-34213-fn-14mbp" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup> I‚Äôm typing these very words on my 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M4 Max inside. Each of these machines was faster than the one before it, outperforming my old iMac Pro and Mac Pro in new ways with every upgrade.</p>
<p>Apple silicon has been nothing but upside for the Mac, and yet some seem bored already. In the days since Apple announced the M5, I‚Äôve seen and heard this sentiment more than I expected:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This is just another boring incremental upgrade.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That üëè is üëè the üëè point.</p>
<p>Back in the PowerPC and Intel days, Macs would sometimes go <em>years</em> between meaningful spec bumps, as Apple waited on its partners to deliver appropriate hardware for various machines. From failing NVIDIA cards in MacBook Pros to 27-inch Intel iMacs that ran so hot the fans were audible at all times, Mac hardware wasn‚Äôt always what Apple wanted.</p>
<p>Of course, some of the issues with previous generations of Mac were Apple‚Äôs fault ‚Äî look no further than the butterfly keyboard or the years the Mac Pro spent in the wilderness. Apple will make questionable decisions in the future, just as it has in the past.</p>
<p>The difference is that with Apple silicon, Apple owns and controls the primary technologies behind the products it makes, <a href="https://asymco.com/2011/01/17/the-cook-doctrine/">as Tim Cook has always wanted</a>. It means that it can ship updates to its SoCs on a regular cadence, making progress in terms of both power and efficiency each time.</p>
<p>A predictable update schedule means that incremental updates are inevitable. <em>Revolution</em> then <em>evolution</em> is not a bad thing; it‚Äôs okay that not every release is exciting or groundbreaking. It‚Äôs how technology has worked for decades.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶but some people have short memories. Before the Apple silicon introduction, we all wanted steady, predictable progress in Mac hardware development. We wanted each product in the lineup to be updated regularly and not wither on the vine for years. For <a href="https://512pixels.net/2023/06/the-new-new-mac-pro/">the <em>most</em> part</a>, Apple has delivered. Just look at this chart of the progress Apple has made since the M1:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/m1-m5-cpu-chart.png" alt="CPU Geekbench 6 Scores"></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/m1-m5-gpu-chart.png" alt="GPU Geekbench 6 Scores"></p>
<p>I don‚Äôt see anything in those charts to complain about, especially given the frequency at which most people buy new computers. That‚Äôs one reason why Apple compared the M5 to the M1 in <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-unleashes-m5-the-next-big-leap-in-ai-performance-for-apple-silicon/">its press release announcing the new chip</a>. Unless you buy a new computer every year, every update you experience will be meaningful.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs what we wanted when Apple announced the move away from Intel, and calling it boring five years in is missing the point and downplaying the success of Apple silicon thus far.</p>

<p>One day on my drive home, I saw three towers. One of them had a bunch of blinking white lights, another one had red lights that kind of faded in and out, and the third one, well, it wasn't doing anything. I'm lucky to have a radio engineer for a dad, so Dad: <em>why do some towers blink?</em></p>

<p>Joe: Well, blinking I would call like the way you described it, "flashing", "white light", or "strobe". All these lights are to aid pilots and air traffic. helicopters, fighter planes, regular jets. So that's the purpose of it.</p>

<p>Jeff: Well that one tower that I saw had red lights that faded in and out, but I even think there's a freestanding tower just north of here that has red and white on top.</p>

<p>Joe: Well red lighting is a thing. It's in the regulations, it specifies red lighting or white lighting, and one of the things like the red lights can be a bulb like this inside of a red housing, could be LED.</p>

<h2>Giant Bulbs</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/giant-620w-tower-beacon-light-bulb-lamp.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-2ee38521-2172-4b55-b44c-1f8323b27f43" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;2ee38521-2172-4b55-b44c-1f8323b27f43&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="620W large tower beacon light bulb"></p>

<p>Jeff: Where'd you find this bulb? This was not in my studio.</p>

<p>Joe: This bulb is a spare bulb for a tower site. And most of us use the same bulb, same socket, 620 watts. It's a very standard broadcast bulb for a broadcast tower. And a lot of the beacons, they're pretty tall and they'll have one right-side up, and one upside-down. So they'll have two bulbs in the socket. That way, when one bulb burns out, you realize you have a bulb out, but you're still legal with the second bulb.</p>

<p>Jeff: At my house, I don't have any of this kind of bulb anymore [incandescent]. I have, you know, this is a little bit different size, these are LED. Is that similar on towers?</p>

<p>Joe: Yeah. So it is the same. Like an <a href="https://pr-tech.com/product/l-864865-dual-beacon/">LED assembly for a tower</a> could be kind of flat, and it has, you know, it's set to just do what it needs to do. So in like white light, that's, typically it used to be always strobes. And at KMOX, you remember we had the whole assembly there. and you see the glass bulb, with xenon gas inside.</p>

<p>So those were the old way for that, but the newer ones are all white LED, and they can be little pancake-looking things compared to what the things are now. They can direct that LED light really to help airplanes and have less trouble for people who live in homes or apartment buildings nearby.</p>

<p>Jeff: So if they have a tower like the one that's just north of here that's in a residential area, you're not just flashing everybody constantly.</p>

<p>Joe: Yes, yes.</p>

<h2>Red light, white light?</h2>

<p>Jeff: You know, thinking about that tower, though, why do different towers have different lighting and different colors and things? And I even remember, like, on the tower that's right by here, there's actually teeny tiny little lights that are, like, on the sides, on the legs of the tower.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/side-markers-kdnl-tv-tower.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-7088cf8a-87ea-4f68-919d-a7e2f6b05f61" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;7088cf8a-87ea-4f68-919d-a7e2f6b05f61&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="KDNL-TV tower side marker red lights"></p>

<p>Joe: Yeah, well, tower lighting is in the responsibility of FAA, and they have a detailed plan. The options depend on the heights of the tower, where they are at. The location is obviously important. And sometimes red is a good solution, sometimes white, and sometimes both, red and white solution. And an example is the tower that you're talking about.</p>

<p>Jeff: So why would you want both? It seems like that's twice the complexity.</p>

<p>Joe: You would have strobe in the day and red at night. And people in their homes at night, a pulsing red light is a lot easier than a big flashing white light.</p>

<p>Jeff: So sometimes if people are complaining about it, you might go to that solution.</p>

<p>Joe: You can propose the red at night and the dual lighting works. And then you literally see these two packs and one will be red and one will be white. That's what I've seen mostly, although I heard that they make one now. It's all in one.</p>

<p>Jeff: [sarcastically] You could have RGB lights‚Äîcould you do Home Assistant for your tower lighting?</p>

<p>Joe: You'd have RGB, but that would not be allowed by the FAA.</p>

<p>Jeff: We'll actually talk about that a little bit too later, because there are some regulations for how you actually monitor these things.</p>

<p>Joe: Yes, there are.</p>

<h2>No lights at all?</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/supertower-top-beacon-off-daytime-mode-light.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-3956130d-1180-43db-b318-de42c334c119" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;3956130d-1180-43db-b318-de42c334c119&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Supertower beacon on top not lit during daytime mode"></p>

<p>Jeff: But before we get to that, what about the one tower I saw didn't have any lights that were blinking at all. And I zoomed in and I saw that there was a light on top, but it just wasn't doing anything.</p>

<p>Joe: Yeah. Well, and this is about daytime mode. So a tower that's painted, and that's legal for obstruction marking, and you don't have to light during the day. So at night, their lights would come on. So you can be in a situation where, like here, you could see three towers. One might be day and night with white light, and two of them might be red light day only, but one kicks on earlier than the other because of their exact photo cell triggering the lights.</p>

<p>Jeff: Or if the photo cell is covered by a layer of soot from 40 years...</p>

<p>Joe: Yeah. So that tower is probably in daytime mode, or it could be an AM tower. An AM tower below 200 feet doesn't have to be lit, so that's another one. In fact, all towers, I guess, under 200 feet, unless you're in a particular area where the FAA would require it.</p>

<p>Jeff: You always have to refer back to the documentation.</p>

<p>Joe: You always refer to the documentation.</p>

<p>Jeff: But what is the tower site that we went to for the hot dogs?</p>

<p>Joe: KHOJ? KHOJ, yeah. Those don't have lights. Those do not have lights.</p>

<p>Jeff: Because they're under 200 feet.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/khoj-am-tower-top-no-beacon-light.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-64a9354a-167c-4c19-b2b2-079eb75fd7e6" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;64a9354a-167c-4c19-b2b2-079eb75fd7e6&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="KHOJ-AM tower top no light because less than 200 ft"></p>

<p>Joe: Yes, so they don't need lighting. So, and then they don't need painting either. So that's one of those things that, again, always refer to that because just because you have a tower that's under 200 feet doesn't mean you don't have to make sure it complies or you may have to paint it or you may have to light and paint.</p>

<p>Tower painting has changed a lot over the years. The older towers have lead in them. So whenever there's a project on the tower, it's not unusual to see the guys in some kind of a, what do they call those?</p>

<p>Jeff: A full ghillie suit? Or I don't know what they're called.</p>

<p>Joe: Yeah. Yeah. So they have that too. So anyway, that's the bottom line from then till now.</p>

<h2>But some short towers <em>do</em> have lights...</h2>

<p>Jeff: So far, we've been talking about radio and TV towers, the ones that are really big. But what about little small towers? I know I see a lot of cell towers that don't have any lights at all, but sometimes they do. They just have one little light bulb on top. Or even if they're 50 to 100 feet tall, I've seen it sometimes.</p>

<p>Joe: Yeah, and there's always a reason for seeing a light somewhere, almost always on structures, including buildings and so forth. But if you look around the area where you're seeing that tower that you know is not 200 feet and it's got a light on the top, look you're probably near an airport, a heliport, or somewhere where there's an aviation hazard. You know hospitals, they have their helipads there.</p>

<p>So everywhere there is a possible hazard for flight for aircraft is going to have lights involved, and that's why we see a lot of buildings even have lights.</p>

<h2>FAA Rules</h2>

<p>Jeff: So it sounds like we have towers and even buildings that have to have lights put up but who's in charge of all this? Like if I'm going to put up my own tower, who do I need to talk to to make sure that i'm doing it right and get it approved?</p>

<p>Joe: I think we go back to our friends at the FAA. They have that particular circular (<a href="https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.current/documentNumber/70_7460-1">AC 70/7460-1M - Obstruction Marking and Lighting</a>). It describes all kinds of of places where lighting is need for air safety.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/5g-cellular-tower-no-lighting.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-ff0e5178-846f-4879-abaf-394f0df70be9" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;ff0e5178-846f-4879-abaf-394f0df70be9&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="5G Cell tower with no lighting"></p>

<p>So that includes our broadcast towers, big chimney stacks, water towers, bridges, nuclear power plant cooling towers, wind turbines, tall electrical towers, you know, those ones that they cross a river, they'll have those extra tall ones with markings in the middle. Sometimes those are required to have lighting.</p>

<p>And there are also rules that even apply during construction projects. So you've got these big buildings going up And you'll notice the cranes will have lights on them. And there's a spec for that, how many lights have to be on the crane, what height it has to be at.</p>

<p>As you look around the next 12 months, look around at all those lights. You'll enjoy it like I do.</p>

<p>Jeff: You'll look like a radio engineer once you know about these things!</p>

<h2>Estimating tower height by light</h2>

<p>Jeff: So that's made me think, like, looking through these instructions, I did find this page. And I thought, like, could you use tower lights, the number of them, as a way to judge how tall a tower is? Kind of a rough estimate.</p>

<p>Joe: Yes, actually you can because the specifications, like for tall, these would apply to radio and TV towers. They require so many lights depending on the height.</p>

<p>Like around here, we would have the F4 version with four lights, four blinking light levels, a light at the top if the antenna here at the top is higher than 40 feet.</p>

<p>So you can kind of look and get an idea of whether you're looking at a 500-foot tower or a 1,000-foot tower. I don't think you could go like 700 versus 1,000 as easily.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/three-towers-blinking-during-bird-migration-with-power-lines.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-ab955a70-d269-4738-81c2-018f47feaec8" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;ab955a70-d269-4738-81c2-018f47feaec8&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Three towers with beacons blinking white strobes while birds migrate"></p>

<p>But you can tell, and the guys know. I know a couple of pilots that are also engineers or selling in radio business, and they can do that. They'll tell you, you know, like I was passing a tower. What's a tower that's a 1,200-foot tower doing out here? So it's pretty fun, and you go to this document has everything you need if you want to take the time and study that and memorize it and then fly.</p>

<h2>Monitoring and reporting outages (and NOTAMs)</h2>

<p>Jeff: One other thing that since we've been running this channel I keep getting emails about, if someone sees that there's lights out on a tower, like let's say it's nighttime and you're out there and you notice like one of these towers for the past few days hasn't had a light on, can you do anything about that? What should you do?</p>

<p>Joe: Well, first of all, if it's required to be lit, every tower that's required to be lit is also required to be monitored.</p>

<p>So in radio, we put a monitoring circuit on the electrical feed to the filaments and you can measure how much current is going through there, right? So you've got to monitor it. You've got to get alarmed by that. The alarm can call you or reach you. But you also have to call every day, check your circuit, your system, and make sure the lights are on. So if you only are lit at night, that means that call has to happen after it's dark.</p>

<p>You've got to verify that your lighting is working, and you have to report it within 30 minutes. And you find that if a light's out, you've got to report it. And we call that a <a href="https://notams.aim.faa.gov/#News">NOTAM</a>, where the FAA puts it on a system that all the pilots can have access to. And they know that there's a tower there, but it's lights out. And they can use it in their flight planning.</p>

<p>Jeff: You're an engineer and you have the tie-in with the FAA or whatever. But what would I be able to do if I did see a tower that was out?</p>

<p>Joe: Well, you can do a NOTAM search. Try to look through and see if you see it. The other thing, you could contact the tower owner or the engineer at the site, the tower's engineer, and they can check into it. They should already know because they have their monitoring equipment, right?</p>

<p>Jeff: They <em>should</em>.</p>

<p>Joe: They should already know. They do.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/fcc-sign-tower-base-supertower.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-c9c46c44-122d-42d6-9f8a-c04e6e509ea2" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;c9c46c44-122d-42d6-9f8a-c04e6e509ea2&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="FCC sign with ASR at bottom of Supertower"></p>

<p>And then, of course, if you're out there, usually the tower, either on the tower or in the fencing around it or on the building, will have an <a href="https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/AsrSearch/asrRegistrationSearch.jsp">ASR number</a>, which identifies that tower to the FAA and the FCC, actually. But that number would be the exact tower that you'd be reporting.</p>

<p>Jeff: So hopefully you learned a little bit more about why there are so many flashing lights around at night and not just for radio towers, but for bridges, buildings, and more. What other things do you want to know about towers? Let us know in the comments.</p></div></div>]]></description>

          <p>After kicking off an unpopular <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/samsung-forces-ads-onto-fridges-is-a-bad-sign-for-other-appliances/">pilot test last month,</a> Samsung made the practice of having its expensive smart fridges display ads official this week.</p>
<p>The ads will be shown on Samsung‚Äôs 2024 Family Hub smart fridges. As of this writing, Samsung‚Äôs Family Hub fridges have MSRPs ranging from <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/refrigerators/all-refrigerators/?shop=Buy+Online&amp;key_category_features=Family+Hub%C3%A2%C2%84%C2%A2&amp;CID=afl-ecomm-rkt-cha-040122-url_Skimlinks.com&amp;utm_source=url_Skimlinks.com&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=1&amp;utm_content=2116208&amp;rktevent=Skimlinks.com_TnL5HPStwNw-XmUXqH629_Fatbxjry_5NQ&amp;ranMID=47773&amp;ranEAID=TnL5HPStwNw&amp;ranSiteID=TnL5HPStwNw-XmUXqH629_Fatbxjry_5NQ">$1,899 to $3,499</a>. The ads will arrive through a software update that Samsung will start issuing this month and display on the fridge‚Äôs integrated 21.5- or 32-inch (depending on the model) screen. The ads will show when the fridges are idle and display what Samsung calls Cover Screens.</p>
<blockquote><p>As part of the Family Hub software update, we are piloting a new widget for select Cover Screens themes of Family Hub refrigerators. The widget will display useful day-to-day information such as news, calendar and weather forecasts, along with curated advertisements.</p></blockquote>
<p>Samsung also said that its fridges will only show contextualized ads, instead of personalized ads, which rely on collecting data on users.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/806797/samsung-family-hub-smart-fridge-ads-opt-out">The Verge</a> reported that the widget will appear as a rectangular box at the bottom of the screens. The box will change what it displays ‚Äúevery 10 seconds,‚Äù the publication said.</p>
<p>The software update will also introduce ‚Äúa Daily Board theme that offers a new way to see useful information at a glance,‚Äù Samsung said. The Verge reported that this feature will also include ads, something that Samsung‚Äôs announcement neglected to state. The Daily Board theme will show five tiles with information such as appointments and the weather, and one with ads.</p>

<p id="71720470-1ea2-47dd-8ac6-aa06b5dcb024">The viability of Linux as a gaming platform has come on leaps and bounds in recent years due to the sterling work of WINE and Proton developers, among others, and interest in hardware like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/handheld-gaming/steam-deck-oled" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/handheld-gaming/steam-deck-oled">Steam Deck</a>.

The latest distilled data shows that almost 90% of Windows games now run on Linux.</p><p>Having nine in ten Windows games accessible in a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/operating-systems/ive-been-using-linux-for-a-quarter-of-a-century-so-why-do-i-keep-coming-back-to-ubuntu" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/operating-systems/ive-been-using-linux-for-a-quarter-of-a-century-so-why-do-i-keep-coming-back-to-ubuntu">Linux </a>install is quite an achievement. The milestone comes as we see computer users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/operating-systems/microsofts-decision-to-axe-windows-10-is-driving-apple-pc-sales-growth-users-buy-macs-instead-of-ai-pcs-despite-microsofts-push-for-copilot-pcs" target="_blank" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/operating-systems/microsofts-decision-to-axe-windows-10-is-driving-apple-pc-sales-growth-users-buy-macs-instead-of-ai-pcs-despite-microsofts-push-for-copilot-pcs">flocking to other platforms</a> during the transition from the Windows 10 to 11 eras. Of course, the underlying data isn‚Äôt quite so simple as the headline stat. There are different degrees of compatibility gamers must consider when checking if their favorite Windows games work on Linux distros like Mint, Zorin, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/bazzite-is-a-steamos-clone-that-supports-gaming-pcs-and-the-steam-deck" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/bazzite-is-a-steamos-clone-that-supports-gaming-pcs-and-the-steam-deck">Bazzite</a>, or even SteamOS.</p><div id="1982442169253363822"><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Windows Games‚Äô Compatibility on Linux Is at an All-Time High: https://t.co/G06smdohrX #linux #linuxgaming #update #gaming #steam #proton #steamplay #wine #compatibility #windows pic.twitter.com/e598JNzqgP<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1982442169253363822" data-url="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1982442169253363822" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">October 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote></div><p id="969416c4-f6ea-4db4-8331-75420898aba3-0">The above chart relies on Boiling Steam‚Äôs five definitions of playability, but these aren‚Äôt a million miles from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/valve-speeds-steam-deck-game-verification-243-titles" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/valve-speeds-steam-deck-game-verification-243-titles">Steam Deck ratings</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/valve" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/valve">Valve</a> dishes out. The main difference seems to be that Boiling Steam doesn‚Äôt seem to care whether Steam Deck performance is a gaming-limiting factor. So, in a way, its ratings are perhaps more useful to desktop and laptop PC users who typically have systems that easily outpace a Steam Deck.</p><p>Boiling Steam platinum (green) rank denotes games that run perfectly, out of the box. Gold (light green) requires just minor tweaks. Silver (yellow) games are playable but have some imperfections. Borked (dark red) games simply refuse to launch. Lastly, Bronze (red) titles exist in the murky water between silver and borked.</p><p>Looking at the chart trends, we see an encouraging growth in the number of new releases that are platinum (green) rated, and a thinning down of the red/dark red zone. Developers will, of course, benefit from more hardware being able to play their games with few if any wrinkles, so there must be an incentive to spend at least a little time checking a new Windows game on Linux, or the Steam Deck specifically.</p><p>On the flip side, there are some popular titles that don‚Äôt look like they will be becoming Linux-friendly anytime soon. The well-known compatibility issues with various <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/battlefield-6s-javelin-anti-cheat-secure-boot-requirement-could-kill-its-steam-deck-support" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/battlefield-6s-javelin-anti-cheat-secure-boot-requirement-could-kill-its-steam-deck-support">anti-cheat </a>technology platforms look set to persist, for now. Moreover, Boiling Steam notes that other devs just seem to be averse to non-Windows gamers. There is quite a bit that can be done with those non-intentionally stubborn games, though. We‚Äôd recommend researching community-driven Linux compatibility tips and tweaks for your favorite games.</p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" id="0a97c2e5-45e3-4848-bc72-ffe8ecf02b73" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

What you‚Äôll learn is that drugs are made by corporations that are optimizing for one primary thing, and one thing only: </span><strong>work</strong><span>. ‚ÄòWorking‚Äô is obviously contextual, but it is a simple concept no matter the situation: reduce a worrying biomarker, improve mood, lengthen lifespan and so on and so on. What does this discovery process ignore? Simply put: everything else a drug could do beyond that.</span></p><p><span>Yes, that‚Äôs a roundabout way of describing ‚Äòoff-target effects‚Äô ‚Äî  defined as the action of a drug at a gene product other than the gene product it was intended to affect ‚Äî but I think it‚Äôs a helpful intuition pump. Viewing the drug discovery process as ‚Äò</span><em><span>not paying attention to anything that is unrelated to the drug </span><strong>working</strong></em><span>‚Äô is useful in that it contextualizes the situation we‚Äôre in. Drugs are meant to make money, and money is derived from </span><strong>drugs working</strong><span>. To spend time on understanding what else a particular drug does beyond It Working for its intended task is time lost and money lost.</span></p><p><span>One unfamiliar with the drug discovery process may find this bizarre; why wouldn‚Äôt the well meaning scientists in charge of developing drugs try to deeply understand how it interacts with the body? On the other hand, those deeply in the medical field would find this thesis so obvious that stating it is unnecessary; of </span><strong>course</strong><span> a pharmaceutical company would limit their scope of understanding a drug to things that lie between it working and not working. There‚Äôs only so much time and resources to go around. Priorities! </span></p><p><span>Of course, if an off-target effect comes between the drug and </span><strong>It Working</strong><span>, then certainly resources will be allocated to deal with it. But beyond that, mapping everything else a clinical-stage drug does ‚Äî every receptor it unintentionally binds, every pathway it nudges sideways, every gene it perturbs slightly ‚Äî is deemed so high effort and so low ROI, that it is relegated to hoping an academic will study it. Only if post-marketing surveillance turns up something worrying shall further exploration occur. Because, again, a deep understanding of </span><strong>what exactly an exogenous chemical is doing inside a body is not the point of the drug discovery process. </strong><span>Working is the point!</span></p><p>With that background context, I am ready to present three claims I‚Äôm going to make in this essay and spend the remaining sections trying to prove:</p><ol><li><p>Understanding off-target effects is really useful.</p></li><li><p>Learning about off-target effects at scale is possible.</p></li><li><p>No for-profit institution has a strong incentive to do this work.</p></li></ol><p>For the moment, let‚Äôs accept that these three are indeed true, and we can put our skeptic hat back on at the end of this section.</p><p><span>The subject of today‚Äôs essay is </span><strong><a href="https://evebio.org/" rel="">EvE Bio</a></strong><span>, and why I think they are doing something incredible.</span></p><p><span>EvE is a bit unlike the typical </span><a href="https://www.owlposting.com/s/startups" rel="">startups</a><span> I write about, because they aren‚Äôt really a startup.

EvE Bio is a scientific non-profit that has a clear, singular mission: </span><strong>map the off-target effects of every FDA-approved drug in existence and share the data.</strong><span> The data will be released underneath a non-commercial, creative commons license ‚Äî free to use by academics, and available for licensing for commercial entities. Once they accomplish this task, they close up shop or spin off into their own thing. And if they don‚Äôt do it within 5-6 years, the same end result still happens. They do have some future plans that may come into the picture with time, which I‚Äôll cover at the end, but the bolded bit is their primary thesis!</span></p><p>So why are they doing this?

Is the institution doing off-target mapping really going to be the ones developing the autonomous lab assays of the future? Maybe! But it feels like a third-order, fourth-order, or even further consequence of their main mission. Bill did mention to me that there are already promising results in that direction, such as better reporting cell lines, but still. I think it‚Äôs generally good to limit ones assessment of an institution based on what their first-order impact will be, and, there, I think there will be three distinct areas that EvE will service</span><strong>: drug repurposing, validation for machine-learning models, </strong><span>and</span><strong> </strong><span>to a weaker degree</span><strong>, polypharmacology.</strong></p><p><span>What about industrial chemical profiling and pharmacology profiling? I think EvE will certainly be important there, but it‚Äôs a bit fuzzier. Industrial chemical profiling may occur in the future but isn‚Äôt part of the current cohort of FDA-approved drugs that EvE is focusing on, and there‚Äôs a similar problem for pharmacology profiling as there is for ML-for-toxicity (</span><a href="https://www.owlposting.com/p/a-primer-on-why-computational-predictive" rel="">which I have written about before as being a challenging proposition</a><span>).</span></p><p><span>But even if we take my somewhat pessimistic stance that only three of these six things are genuinely tractable in the short term, </span><strong>those areas alone are extremely valuable.</strong><span> Let‚Äôs go over them.</span></p><p><span>I think it is under-appreciated just how </span><strong>rich</strong><span> the cohort of FDA-approved drugs that are out there. Consider the fact that basically all drugs start off with singular indications, meant to cure, alleviate, or address </span><strong>one</strong><span> thing.</span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40545-020-00282-8" rel=""> Yet, 30%~ of FDA-approved drugs gain a new post-approval indication,</a><span> based on a study of the 197 drugs approved by the FDA from 1997-2020. Funnily enough, the same paper that came up with that 30% number almost treats it as a matter of disappointment, </span><strong>given that 38% of all prescriptions written in the US are off-label!</strong><span> This implies that there are, potentially, hundreds of drugs that are </span><em>already</em><span> being used beyond their original scope, just without the formal validation or regulatory blessing. Which, in turn, implies that we‚Äôre sitting on a vast, under-explored landscape of therapeutic potential, one that clinicians are already intuitively poking into, but which the formal system has barely begun to chart.</span></p><p><span>Now, I think some caution is warranted. This 38% number does vary from paper to paper,</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11892052/" rel=""> one other study claims off-label prescriptions are as low as 25%.</a><span> If we‚Äôre being even </span><strong>more</strong><span> fair, it‚Äôs questionable exactly how proven-out these off-label indications are.</span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/410250" rel=""> One 2006 study claims that of the 21% of off-label prescriptions</a><span> they found, 73% of them had little-to-no scientific support. Hard to tell whether this is because there simply are no studies, or because the off-label usage was actively disproved!</span></p><p><span>Consider gabapentin, one of the most egregious cases of off-label drug prescriptions. Typically, most people view gabapentin as the nerve injury drug, right?

Why? New chemical entities must follow the typical clinical phase progression timeline, whereas any repurposed drugs can skip preclinical, phase 1, and (sometimes)</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10627937/" rel=""> phase 2 trials as a result of their already-collected toxicity data</a><span>. Billions of dollars and years of time could be saved! </span></p><p><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5694537/" rel="">From a 2017 review paper.</a></p><blockquote><p><em><span>‚Ä¶repurposed drugs are generally approved sooner (3‚Äì12‚Äâyears) and at reduced (50‚Äì60%) cost (</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5694537/#B5" rel="">5</a><span>,</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5694537/#B6" rel=""> 6</a><span>). In addition, while ~10% of new drug applications gain market approval, approximately 30% of repurposed drugs are approved, giving companies a market-driven incentive to repurpose existing assets (</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5694537/#B5" rel="">5</a><span>)‚Ä¶.</span></em></p><p><em><span>For example, repurposing of the emergency contraceptive, mifepristone, for Cushing‚Äôs syndrome required a cohort of less than 30 patients to test its efficacy, whereas a clinical trial</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5694537/#fn1" rel=""><sup>1</sup></a><span> for the same indication evaluating the safety and efficacy of a new chemical entity, levoketoconazole, required ~90 individuals (</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5694537/#B2" rel="">2</a><span>,</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5694537/#B3" rel=""> 3</a><span>)‚Ä¶..</span></em></p></blockquote><p>But, as it stands today, most drug repurposing efforts are done somewhat blindly; haphazardly glancing through the literature, relying on anecdotal case reports, or waiting for some academic lab to publish a five-mouse study from 2013 that hints at a secondary use. In many ways, it isn‚Äôt too dissimilar to the usual drug-discovery process! Given how promising (and relatively limited) the list of FDA-approved drugs are, the simple act of a pre-triaged list of drug-target maps (EvE‚Äôs mission!) may be extraordinarily impactful.</p><p><span>In such a world where this data is easily accessible, perhaps an order of magnitude more energy would be devoted to repurposing efforts,</span><a href="https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1921986782523978044" rel=""> maybe vastly improving the currently horrific finances of modern day drug discovery.</a></p><p><span>But as with all seeming free-lunches, there‚Äôs a reason drug repurposing hasn‚Äôt been aggressively exploited beyond a few cases: economics. Unlike novel drugs, which come with fresh patents and a full runway of exclusivity, repurposed drugs necessarily rely on compounds whose original patents have expired or are near expiration</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-160871483" href="https://www.owlposting.com/p/mapping-the-off-target-effects-of#footnote-1-160871483" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>. This limits the sponsor‚Äôs ability to recoup development costs, because generic competition can quickly erode any profits once the drug hits the market, even if it‚Äôs approved for a new use. There </span><em>are</em><span> mechanisms to extend exclusivity for repurposed indications ‚Äî such as the</span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/industry/medical-products-rare-diseases-and-conditions/designating-orphan-product-drugs-and-biological-products" rel=""> 7-year exclusivity period given by the FDA‚Äôs Orphan Drug Act for treatments of rare diseases</a><span> or the</span><a href="https://www.mayerbrown.com/-/media/files/perspectives-events/events/2023/05/fda-lifecycle-management-webinar-3year-new-clinical-investigation-exclusivity--may-11-2023-final.pdf%3Frev=478b889bb39944e086c77a3c8de4faeb" rel=""> 3-year-exclusivity granted in cases where new clinical data was needed to repurpose a drug</a><span> ‚Äî but it is a risky enough bet that most companies will shy away from it.</span></p><p><span>But as EvE is a non-profit, the economics don‚Äôt </span><strong>need</strong><span> to make sense. They plan to periodically announce opportunities for repurposing to the world, in hopes that other well-meaning non-profits take it on or, if the evidence is sufficiently convincing, that doctors simply take it as a useful datapoint for deciding whether an off-label prescription may be useful. And if they do most of the legwork in identifying good candidates for repurposing, it may even make the economics worth it for for-profit entities to pursue further. </span></p><p><span>One of the easiest ways to assure yourself that what you‚Äôre doing is valuable is if people come up to you and ask if they could use whatever you‚Äôre producing. This is true in typical SaaS products, and it is true for the fruits of R&amp;D work. But beyond assessing value outright, it also helps you learn </span><strong>what</strong><span> your work is most valuable for.</span></p><p><span>And, curiously, the primary area in which EvE has found ‚Äòproduct market fit‚Äô is in companies asking to use their data for internal model validation efforts. As I mentioned before, while EvE‚Äôs dataset is free-to-use by academics, it requires a commercial license to be used by any for-profit entity. And they are currently in discussions with 4 such commercial entities, all of whom desire to use EvE‚Äôs dataset to </span><strong>validate their machine-learning models predictions.</strong></p><p><span>Historically, model builders in drug discovery have had to make do with whatever internal datasets they could get their hands on, which were typically limited in scope, biased toward certain classes of molecules, or simply not reproducible. Public data from sources like</span><a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/" rel=""> ChEMBL</a><span>,</span><a href="https://www.bindingdb.org/rwd/bind/index.jsp" rel=""> BindingDB</a><span>, or</span><a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/docs/bioassays" rel=""> PubChem BioAssay</a><span> are much larger in size, but they tend to be noisy, heterogeneous in experimental methodology, and </span><strong>always</strong><span> lack negative results. Worse, they‚Äôre often cherry-picked around success stories or clustered around well-studied targets, introducing systemic biases that hamper generalization. We need not look further than Pat Walter‚Äôs famous essay on the topic:</span><a href="https://practicalcheminformatics.blogspot.com/2023/08/we-need-better-benchmarks-for-machine.html" rel=""> We Need Better Benchmarks for Machine Learning in Drug Discovery</a><span>, which expands on these issues even more.</span></p><p>This is an area of EvE‚Äôs work that I cannot personally shed much light on, and obviously, Bill cannot tell me the exact details on what the commercial entities are working on. But it was a surprising learning from our conversation that this particular topic is where public interest is most rapidly coalescing! Very excited to hear about more public statements they make in this area soon.</p><p>I do think this is the weakest, day-one value-add for EvE‚Äôs dataset. So take this section with a grain of salt! It just felt too interesting to not cover.</p><p><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10243259/" rel="">Polypharmacology is a drug discovery approach where a drug is designed to target multiple molecular targets</a><span>, instead of a more traditional single-target approach. It‚Äôs not a particularly new idea, most clinically useful drugs exhibit multi-target activity whether they were designed that way or not. But what‚Äôs changed in the past decade is the </span><strong>intentionality</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>I think there are a lot of different arguments for the value of polypharmacology, the easiest one hinging on efficacy. There‚Äôs a very interesting story that could be told here about drugs that worked better because they modulated the activity of multiple receptors in parallel. A great, recent example is that of drugs that followed Ozempic. Ozempic simply targeted GLP-1, which reduces appetite and slows digestion. But the second-generation (e.g. Zepbound) also targeted GIP, which amplifies insulin response and regulates lipid metabolism differently in adipose tissue. The effects were incredible: </span><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2416394?" rel="">13.7% weight loss with Ozempic, 20.2% weight loss with Zepbound</a><span> over 48 weeks. Synergistic effects! The third generation (e.g. retatrutide) tacks on interactions with glucagon receptors ‚Äî potentially increasing metabolic rate ‚Äî </span><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2301972" rel="">with early phase 2 results looking once again promising. </a></p><p><span>But a more interesting place to start is the very similarly named concept of </span><strong>polypharmacy.</strong></p><p><span>Polypharmacy refers to the clinical practice of prescribing multiple drugs simultaneously (usually 5+), typically to manage complex or co-occurring conditions. It‚Äôs common in geriatrics, psychiatry, oncology, and increasingly just about everywhere else in medicine: </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10337167/" rel="">~17% of all adults in the US meet the definition for polypharmacy</a><span>. The logic is straightforward: most diseases aren‚Äôt governed by a single pathway, and so tackling them with a single drug is often insufficient. Instead, clinicians stack therapies: an ACE inhibitor for the blood pressure, a statin for the cholesterol, metformin for the glucose, a GLP-1 for the weight, and so on.</span></p><p><span>As you may expect, polypharmacy is </span><strong>awful</strong><span> on the patient's physiology.</span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28251277/" rel=""> One study estimates that</a><span> nearly </span><strong>10% of hospital admissions among older adults</strong><span> are directly attributable to adverse drug events from polypharmacy-related side effects. The more drugs we stack onto people, the more unpredictable the net interaction becomes, because even if each one has been individually safety-tested, nobody tests all the pairwise combinations in a clinically realistic setting.</span></p><p>The solution may very well be to bundle things up.</p><p><span>Rather than throwing five separately optimized molecules at a patient and hoping for cooperative behavior, we could, in principle, design a </span><strong>single </strong><span>molecule that alone engages the same therapeutic targets. This, in turn, allows clinical trials to suss out the net effect of such a drug in a controlled, interpretable way. Which naturally leads us to the utility of polypharmacology; not necessarily because it will give us magic drugs with efficacy far better than current ones (though it may!), but rather that it will simply avoid us having to deal with the current issues that polypharmacy presents.</span></p><p>But the obvious question: does EvE‚Äôs dataset help with polypharmacology efforts? There isn‚Äôt any current, empirical proof of this, but I think it will. If you squint, you could see it functioning as missing infrastructure, a dataset that is necessary for rational polypharmacology to occur at scale. But this is necessarily tied up with machine-learning for chemical design accelerating, so, again, this is not necessarily something I‚Äôd expect EvE‚Äôs work to contribute to by the end of the year. But perhaps soon!</p><p>This all said, even if you agreed that the value proposition that EvE is claiming is real, you may struggle to verbalize exactly how you would understand the off-target effects of the 13,000~ FDA approved drugs out there. What assays would you use? How do you dose any given drug? How do you understand the translation of your assay to real-world settings?</p><p>Let‚Äôs walk through the EvE workflow.</p><p>First, you need to decide what drugs you're actually going to test. While there are technically around 13,000 FDA-approved drugs out there, many of them aren't particularly relevant for this kind of screening. You can immediately exclude things like topical medications, inhalants, radioisotopes, and simple nutrients, stuff that is known to be largely innocuous or not have much systemic impact. After this initial filtering, you end up with about 1,600 small molecule drugs that are worth investigating. But this number gets further whittled down further based on practical constraints; availability, cost, licensing requirements, etc.</p><p>From this, EvE ended up with a library of 1,397 compounds to screen.</p><p><span>Then comes the harder question: what exactly are you screening against? The human body has somewhere around 20,000 protein-coding genes, and there is an argument that any drug could interact with any of them. But perhaps we‚Äôd be too zealous to immediately do an </span><em>(everything x everything)</em><span> screen. Shouldn‚Äôt we try to do something that‚Äôs closer to the Pareto optimal frontier? What if we suspect that the vast majority of clinically meaningful drug interactions occur with a tiny subset of those 20,000 genes?</span></p><p>And, indeed, that turns out to be the case.</p><p><span>The vast majority of genes have some nominal physiological function, yes, but when it comes to drug interactions, only a minority are commonly targeted. At least a minority of classes: </span><strong>nuclear receptors</strong><span> </span><strong>(NRs)</strong><span> and </span><strong>7-transmembrane receptors (also known as GPCRs). </strong><span>In total, there are about 800~ GPCRs and 48 NRs, but only</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11089380/" rel=""> 110 GPCR‚Äôs</a><span> and</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11279859/" rel=""> 12-13 NR‚Äôs</a><span> are actually targeted by drugs. Per last count, EvE has currently created data for</span><a href="https://data.evebio.org/data_explorer__3.html#targets" rel=""> 56 GPCR‚Äôs and 29 NR‚Äôs</a><span>. Over the course of their existence, they plan to cover, in total, a select set of the 200 GPCR‚Äôs and all 48 NR‚Äôs. Why not all 800 GPCR‚Äôs? I attached that information in the footnotes.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-160871483" href="https://www.owlposting.com/p/mapping-the-off-target-effects-of#footnote-2-160871483" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> </span></p><p>They hope to do much more than this too, but we‚Äôll cover that in the last section.</p><p><span>Both NRs and GPCRs have some nice properties, but most pertinent to EvE, they are known to be very ‚Äòdruggable‚Äô classes of drugs, given that the cell often uses them to convey information from the outside world, and evolution has therefore made their binding pockets unusually receptive to small molecules.</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8233523/" rel=""> GPCRs, sitting on the cell surface, are natural sensors for hormones, neurotransmitters, and other circulating ligands</a><span>, many of which resemble or inspire drug scaffolds</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3677810/" rel="">. NRs, meanwhile, act as intracellular switches that come with protected internal pockets</a><span> meant to bind to estrogen, cortisol, and so on, making them ideal for selective small-molecule engagement. As a result, both are involved in a </span><strong>lot</strong><span> of important physiological processes.</span></p><p><span>This ‚Äòphysiological importance‚Äô is useful in two ways! One, a plurality of drugs target the two ‚Äî</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10252477/" rel=""> 13% of FDA-approved drugs target NR‚Äôs</a><span>, with that number jumping to</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5820538/" rel=""> 35% for GPCR‚Äôs</a><span> ‚Äî so mapping the interactions here may give a clinically meaningful view of off-target effects. And two, given the extreme importance of GPCR‚Äôs and NR‚Äôs in modern-day drug development, there has been a fair bit of work in improving how we study their interactions with ligands of interest. As in, new assays outright shouldn‚Äôt need to be developed to study them.</span></p><p><span>Speaking of that, let‚Äôs start talking about </span><strong>how</strong><span> they are building this drug x receptor interaction map. They rely on two well-established assays which I‚Äôll discuss here, but feel free to skip, understanding the two isn‚Äôt particularly important.</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>TR-FRET-based co-factor recruitment assays for NRs</strong></p><ol><li><p><span>When a drug successfully activates an NR, it usually causes a conformational shift that allows the receptor to recruit a specific co-factor protein, exposing what is often called the ‚ÄòAF2 domain‚Äô</span><strong>. These co-factors tend to have little peptide motifs (like an LXXLL motif) that latch onto that domain.</strong></p></li><li><p><span>TF-FRET exploits this. A chemical is tagged onto the NR domain and a chemical is tagged onto the co-factor protein, both of which are fluorophores. </span><strong>If the FDA-approved drug is an agonist, you‚Äôll see a spike of light appear as the two fluorophores interact.</strong></p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Tango Œ≤-arrestin recruitment assays for 7TMs/GPCRs</strong></p><ol><li><p><span>Instead of recruiting co-factors inside the nucleus like NR‚Äôs, GPCR‚Äôs sit on the surface of a cell and transmit signals inward. As the name of the protein class implies, this involves utilizing</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein" rel=""> G-proteins</a><span>. Unfortunately, G-proteins are quite specific to </span><strong>their</strong><span> GPCR, so using them in our assay as a way to understand activation would be difficult to scale. Luckily, there is a nearly universal binding protein:</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrestin_beta_1" rel=""> Œ≤-arrestin</a><span>. When a GPCR is activated by [something], their signaling process almost always involves binding to that protein.</span></p></li><li><p><span>In the assay, the GPCR (attached to a cell surface) is engineered to have a built-in ‚Äútrap‚Äù, a little molecular tag connected to a transcription factor. When Œ≤-arrestin is recruited, it brings along a protease that snips the tag, releasing the transcription factor. That transcription factor then moves into the nucleus and turns on a reporter gene, which encodes for the enzyme Œ≤-lactamase. Meanwhile, the cell is loaded with </span><strong>CCF4-AM</strong><span>, a fluorescent substrate that shifts its emission profile when cleaved by Œ≤-lactamase. </span><strong>The stronger the GPCR activation by a drug, the more Œ≤-lactamase is produced, the more substrate is cleaved, and the bigger the fluorescence shift.</strong><span> </span><strong>That shift, measured as a ratio between ‚Äòstarting‚Äô and ‚Äòending‚Äô wavelengths, serves as a readout of how strongly the receptor was activated.</strong></p></li></ol></li></ol><p>Reasonably simple! One note: the explanations I gave above is for assessing the difference between an inactive drug and an agonist. For assessing inactive versus antagonist, a separate experiment is run with a known ligand included.</p><p><span>Well, wait a minute. Aren‚Äôt we missing something? Off-target effects of a small molecule can be summarized purely by these GPCR/NR measurements, but we‚Äôd be failing to capture something else that is of vital importance: whether the drug outright kills the cell. One could imagine this also affecting our receptor experiments! Perhaps a drug is an antagonist and there is no color shift, or perhaps the cell is just </span><strong>dead</strong><span>, and nothing is being expressed at all. Conversely, a drug might look like an agonist due to signal drift as the cell‚Äôs internal environment falls apart.</span></p><p><strong>EvE solves this in a pragmatic way: run a third assay which measures how healthy the cell is</strong><span>. How do you measure that? Well, one good proxy for how functional a cell is </span><strong>ATP production</strong><span>. Metabolically active cells generate ATP to power all their intracellular processes. Dead ones don‚Äôt. The assay EvE uses is called </span><strong>CellTiter-Glo</strong><span>. It works by adding a reagent that causes a fluorescent reaction in the presence of ATP. More ATP, more light. Less ATP, less light. No ATP? No light (and likely dead). Again, simple!</span></p><p><span>Is that all? One last thing: accounting for pan-assay interference compounds, or PAINS. These are molecules that often give false positives in high-throughput screening regimes. This can occur for </span><strong>many</strong><span> different reasons, but one relevant example is if a molecule itself is a fluorophore, leading to us falsely believing that it is an agonist during a run. EvE simply tracks how often a drug is leading to positive results, and flags it in their results if they believe it is a PAINS.</span></p><p>So they run these three assays across their pairwise (drug x receptor) combinations, producing readouts at multiple different concentrations with replicates for each one.</p><p><span>I‚Äôm going to skip over a lot at this point. EvE clearly put an immense amount of work into QA‚Äôing this process and filtering through the data, and I think I would do both a disservice and detract from the point of this essay if I were to attempt to repeat it here. Summarizing it all down, using a complex logic table</span><a href="https://data.evebio.org/data_explorer__4b.html#methods" rel=""> detailed here in Fig 7</a><span>, EvE assigns 1 of 4 categories to each (drug x receptor) combination:</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>Inactive.</strong><span> Drug likely has no effect on the receptor, across all tested concentrations. Maybe it doesn‚Äôt bind or maybe it binds but does nothing.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Likely Inactive.</strong><span> A little more ambiguous, perhaps there‚Äôs a single noisy point above baseline, but nothing more.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Active ‚Äì Unquantified.</strong><span> Something is happening, since there‚Äôs reproducible activity, but not enough clean data to fit a proper dose-response curve.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Active ‚Äì Quantified</strong><span>. The drug produced a clear, dose-dependent response (as either an agonist or antagonist) with a well-behaved curve. From this, EvE fits a 4-parameter logistic model and extracts a pXC‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ; the negative log concentration at which the drug produces half its maximal effect. </span></p></li></ol><p>And‚Ä¶that‚Äôs it. A clean, rigorous, and tractable approach to understanding off-target effects, across hundreds of receptors, at multiple concentrations, using multiple modes of detection, with full transparency around the data.</p><p><span>How far along is EvE on their mission? Circa their last data release on 5/7/2025, </span><strong>237,490 (drug x concentration x receptor) combinations have been screened, revealing 8 median agonists and 31 median antagonists per target. </strong><span>They run these experiments in 384 well plates, so that means they‚Äôve run the process a little bit over 600~ times to generate their current dataset ‚Äî though much of the current process is automated, very little human-done pipetting is going on.</span><a href="https://data.evebio.org/" rel=""> Data dumps of the data started in November 2024, with new ones dropping every few months.</a></p><p>I haven‚Äôt worked in a wet lab before, but I‚Äôve been assured by at least one person I trust that the effort that went into assembling this all together is nothing short of extraordinary. But it is worth asking the question‚Ä¶</p><p><span>When assessing the value of a seeming scientific achievement, it‚Äôs usually good to step back and ask one question:</span><strong> why wasn‚Äôt this done a decade back?</strong></p><p>In some cases, the answer is boring: the technology wasn‚Äôt there yet to achieve it.</p><p><span>But here, the technology was almost certainly available! Eve‚Äôs assay for measuring NR activity has been around</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3025134/" rel=""> at least since 2008</a><span>, and the one for GPCR</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3014586/" rel=""> since 2010</a><span>, maybe even earlier for both. If it‚Äôs really </span><strong>that</strong><span> useful, why did it take so long for someone to start assembling this drug x receptor mapping together?</span></p><p><span>Haven‚Äôt I already given away this answer? In the introduction, I implied that pharma groups have no direct financial incentive to create such a dataset. And that is true to some degree, especially for smaller therapeutic companies that have bigger issues to focus on, </span><strong>but is that true for big pharma?</strong><span> A small slice of the billions in pharma spending couldn‚Äôt be sliced off to hand over to an internal research team? It‚Äôs not as if the data wouldn‚Äôt be useful for their </span><strong>own</strong><span> drug development pipelines. After all, off-target effects are among the most common reasons for late-stage trial failures and post-approval black box warnings, and even if the creation of an EvE-like dataset doesn‚Äôt fix the problem, I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôd hurt.</span></p><p><span>I should be fair: pharma companies do indeed do </span><strong>some</strong><span> of this. EvE‚Äôs own blog discusses this a little,</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-024-00942-3" rel=""> referencing this paper:</a></p><blockquote><p><em>The report‚Äôs authors, luminaries in the discipline of safety pharmacology, surveyed 18 major pharmaceutical companies regarding the numbers and identities of potential off-targets against which they test each and every one of their new drug candidates in the interest of safety. The numbers ranged from a low of 11 to a high of 104 potential off-targets routinely profiled per company, with a median of about 45. Interestingly, the industry‚Äôs opinions regarding which potential off-targets to screen vary widely. The total number of potential off-targets screened, across the universe of all 18 pharmas, was 763, yet only 12% of them were screened by more than a third of those companies.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>So, yes, pharma companies do their own off-target screening. But, as we‚Äôve discussed, this is a far cry from the universe of druggable receptors, and is only concentrated on </span><strong>their</strong><span> particular assets, not other ones. No attempt at creating a universal map!</span></p><p><span>But the same blogpost did reference another big pharma,</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40064-9" rel=""> Novartis, who also open-source</a><span> a </span><strong>much</strong><span> larger map:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Novartis, who presented data collected ‚Äúover a multi-year period‚Äù profiling drug/target interactions across a median of about 800 drugs per target and 105 gene product targets‚Ä¶</em></p></blockquote><p><span>This is impressive! One may imagine that if a big pharma was willing to release this, why does an entity like EvE need to exist? For interest's sake, let‚Äôs ignore the obvious answer of ‚Äò</span><em>it is better for everyone if such a dataset is collected using a single, standardized protocol instead of compiled from unrelated experiments over years.</em><span>‚Äô</span></p><p>I asked Bill exactly this question, and the answer was a two-parter.</p><p><span>For one, the dataset that was collected by Novartis, and indeed every large-scale dataset that will ever be collected by big pharma, will always be limited by the constraint we mentioned at the start: everybody only cares about the drug working. </span><strong>A logical conclusion of this is that nearly every receptor covered in these sorts of screens is a safety-oriented receptor</strong><span>. Cytochrome P450, hERG, serotonin subtypes, dopamine D‚ÇÇ, and the like. These are important receptors, not because of how mechanistically interesting they are, but because they are </span><strong>dangerous</strong><span>.</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-024-00942-3" rel=""> Indeed, the vast majority of screened receptors lie within the so-called Bowes-44 set</a><span>, which comes from a</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3845" rel=""> 2012 paper that identified 44 receptors known to be often implicated in safety-related drug failures.</a><span> Though these do include NR‚Äôs and GPCR‚Äôs, it is a minimal set of them, as, again, the screening is not meant to assess how mechanistically interesting the receptors are.</span></p><p><span>And if a big pharma </span><strong>does</strong><span> decide to explore beyond the realm of safety-oriented receptors, they will almost certainly keep that dataset to themselves. Why release potential </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(finance)" rel="">alpha</a><span> to competitors? Hence, why nothing quite like EvE has come out in the past and it is unlikely it ever will in the future, at least from a for-profit entity.</span></p><p><span>And two, EvE eventually hopes to cover a </span><strong>lot</strong><span> more ground than any of the publicly available datasets. Currently, yes, the Novartis dataset is larger than EvE‚Äôs, but it won‚Äôt be for long. In fact, their plans for the upcoming few years ended up being so interesting that I decided to split it off into another section:</span></p><p>EvE is still quite young, just over 2 years old, and I think the future of it is going to look really, really crazy. At the end of my startup coverage articles, I typically focus on commercial/scientific risks. But given that EvE is assured funding on a multi-year horizon without needing to care about market demands, it may be much more instructive (and interesting!) to instead discuss their upcoming plans.</p><p><span>Earlier I noted that EvE has currently released data for 29 NRs and 56 GPCRs, out of a planned 40 NR‚Äôs and 200 GPCR‚Äôs. In my conversation with Bill, I asked him how much time is left till the remaining ones are released. I expected the answer to be, optimistically, ‚Äò</span><em>over the next few years</em><span>‚Äô, given how EvE only started to release data back in November 2024 </span><strong>and</strong><span> that the Novartis dataset collection process also took several years. </span><strong>I was astonished to learn that he expected to have released the remainder of all GPCR + NR screens dataset by the end of this year.</strong><span> Setting up the assays, validation, and automation was the hard part, which is why their data releases have only started recently. But now that that‚Äôs all set up, they simply must turn the crank to get the rest out of the door.</span></p><p><span>What‚Äôs next? Bill told me that the next target of receptors are kinases, 500~ or so receptors that have been</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-024-00942-3" rel=""> increasingly valuable drug targets over the last 20 years.</a></p><p>Then what? Bill said he‚Äôs open to exploring even more drug targets, but he also said, surprisingly, that EvE may add more chemicals on top of the 1,600~ planned FDA-approved drugs. The FDA-approved drugs, he said, are success stories. Potentially it‚Äôd be even more interesting to consider the failures as well. Especially the ones that everybody expected to work, arrived at phase 3, and set billions of dollars on fire after the trial results came out.</p><p><span>Even more exotic options are also on the table. For example, Bill discussed exploring how metabolites of approved drugs interact with targets. Some context:</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-024-00942-3" rel=""> most secondary pharmacology work stops at the parent compound</a><span>, but metabolic byproducts of a drug can have entirely different binding profiles, and, in some cases, they‚Äôre the ones responsible for efficacy (e.g codeine, which metabolizes into the much more effective morphine) </span><em>or</em><span> for toxicity (e.g. acetaminophen, which metabolizes into the very toxic</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI" rel=""> NAPQI</a><span>). He also mentioned potentially using EvE‚Äôs assaying work to develop our understanding of tool compounds, which are chemicals that don‚Äôt necessarily have therapeutic value themselves, but are used in research to probe specific biological pathways or validate target function.</span><a href="https://axial.acs.org/medicinal-chemistry/call-for-reviews-recommended-tool-compounds-for-biological-and-pharmacological-studies" rel=""> An ACS page has this to say about it:</a></p><blockquote><p><em>While tool compounds have tremendous potential for advancing life science research, they are broadly defined, and it is often difficult for a researcher to determine the best tool compounds to employ during the research process. There remains a great need for more tool compound databases and authoritative sources of information from experts in the field.</em></p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/tool-compound-s-new-personality" rel="">And, as always, there is a (very short) Derek Lowe piece</a><span> on how a commonly-relied upon tool compound moonlights as a ligand for a structurally unrelated receptor, likely muddying the literature the tiniest bit. More work here would almost certainly be deeply appreciated by those in the field.</span></p><p><span>Overall, EvE really exemplifies the thesis I put forward in a past essay about how</span><a href="https://www.owlposting.com/p/there-arent-enough-smart-people-in" rel=""> smart people in biology should do more boring things.</a><span> Very little that is directly sexy about doing an N x M screen, but the impact of doing something like it </span><strong>well</strong><span> can be immense. And I have little doubt that EvE Bio has been doing it well, and will continue to do so in their future projects.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>We recently published a <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/2025/09/29/google-developer-registration-decree.html">blog
post</a>
with our reaction to the new Google Developer Program and how it impacts
your freedom to use the devices that you own in the ways that you want. The
post garnered quite a lot of feedback and interest from the community and
press, as well as various civil society groups and regulatory agencies.</p>

<p>In this post, I hope to clarify and expand on some of the points and rebut
some of the counter-messaging that we have witnessed.</p>

<h3 id="googles-message-that-sideloading-is-not-going-away-is-clear-concise-and-false">Google‚Äôs message that ‚ÄúSideloading is Not Going Away‚Äù is clear, concise, and false</h3>

<p>Shortly after our post was published, Google aired an
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7DEhW-mjdc&amp;t=613s">episode</a> of their
Android Developers Roundtable series, where they state unequivocally that
‚Äúsideloading isn‚Äôt going anywhere‚Äù. They follow-up with a <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/09/lets-talk-security-answering-your-top.html">blog
post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Does this mean sideloading is going away on Android?</strong> Absolutely not. Sideloading is fundamental to Android and it is not going away.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement is untrue. The developer verification decree effectively ends
the ability for individuals to choose what software they run on the devices
they own.</p>

<p>It bears reminding that ‚Äúsideload‚Äù is a made-up term. Putting software on
your computer is simply called ‚Äúinstalling‚Äù, regardless of whether that
computer is in your pocket or on your desk. This could perhaps be further
precised as ‚Äú<em>direct</em> installing‚Äù, in case you need to make a distinction
between obtaining software the old-fashioned way versus going through a
rent-seeking intermediary marketplace like the Google Play Store or the
Apple App Store.</p>

<p>Regardless, the term ‚Äúsideload‚Äù was coined to insinuate that there is
something dark and sinister about the process, as if the user were making an
end-run around safeguards that are designed to keep you protected and
secure. But if we reluctantly accept that ‚Äúsideloading‚Äù is a term that has
wriggled its way into common parlance, then we should at least use a
consistent definition for it. Wikipedia‚Äôs summary
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideloading">definition</a> is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>the transfer of apps from web sources that are not vendor-approved</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>By this definition, Google‚Äôs statement that ‚Äúsideloading is not going away‚Äù
is simply <em>false</em>. The vendor ‚Äî Google, in the case of Android certified
devices ‚Äî will, in point of fact, be approving the source. The supplicant
app developer must register with Google, pay a fee, provide government
identification, agree to non-negotiable (and ever-changing) terms and
conditions, enumerate all their current and future application identifiers,
upload evidence of their private signing key, and then hope and wait for
Google‚Äôs approval.</p>

<h3 id="what-this-means-for-your-rights">What this means for your rights</h3>

<p>You, the consumer, purchased your Android device believing in Google‚Äôs
promise that it was an open computing platform and that you could run
whatever software you choose on it. Instead, starting next year, they will
be non-consensually pushing an update to your operating system that
irrevocably blocks this right and leaves you at the mercy of their judgement
over what software you are permitted to trust.</p>

<p>You, the creator, can no longer develop an app and share it directly with
your friends, family, and community without first seeking Google‚Äôs
approval. The promise of Android ‚Äî and a marketing advantage it has used to
distinguish itself against the iPhone ‚Äî has always been that it is
‚Äúopen‚Äù. But Google clearly feels that they have enough of a lock on the
Android ecosystem, along with sufficient regulatory capture, that they can
now jettison this principle with prejudice and impunity.</p>

<p>You, the state, are ceding the rights of your citizens and your own digital
sovereignty to a company with a track record of complying with the
extrajudicial demands of authoritarian regimes to remove perfectly legal
apps that they happen to dislike. The software that is critical to the
running of your businesses and governments will be at the mercy of the
opaque whims of a distant and unaccountable corporation. Monocultures are
perilous not just in agriculture, but in software distribution as well.</p>

<p>As a reminder, this applies not just to devices that exclusively use the
Google Play Store: this is for <em>every</em> Android Certified device <em>everywhere</em>
in the world, which encompasses over 95% of all Android devices outside of
China. Regardless of whether the device owner prefers to use a competing app
store like the Samsung Galaxy Store or the Epic Games Store, or a free and
open-source app repository like F-Droid, they will be captive to the
overarching policies unilaterally dictated by a competing corporate entity.</p>

<h3 id="the-place-of-greater-safety">The place of greater safety</h3>

<p>In promoting their developer registration program, Google
<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html">purports</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Our recent analysis found over 50 times more malware from internet-sideloaded sources than on apps available through Google Play.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We haven‚Äôt seen this recent analysis ‚Äî or any other supporting evidence ‚Äî
but the ‚Äú50 times‚Äù multiple does certainly sound like great cause for
distress (even if it is a surprisingly round number). But given the recent
<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/09/224-malicious-apps-removed-from-the-google-play-store-after-ad-fraud-campaign-discovered">news</a>
of ‚Äú224 malicious apps removed from the Google Play Store after ad fraud
campaign discovered‚Äù, we are left to wonder whether their energies might
better be spent assessing and improving their own safeguards rather than
casting vague disparagements against the software development communities
that thrive outside their walled garden.</p>

<p>In addition, other recent
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/26/apps_android_malware/">news</a> of over
19 million downloads of malware from the Play Store leads us to question
whether the sole judgement of a single corporate entity can be trusted to
identify and assess malware, especially when that judgement is clouded by
commercial incentives that may not align with the well-being of their users.</p>

<h3 id="what-can-be-done">What can be done?</h3>

<p>Google has been facing public outcry against their heavy-handed policies for
a long time, but this trend has accelerated recently. Last year they
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/chromes-manifest-v3-and-its-changes-for-ad-blocking-are-coming-real-soon/">crippled
ad-blockers</a>
in Chrome and Chromium-based browsers by forcing through their unpopular
‚Äúmanifest v3‚Äù requirement for plugins, and earlier this year they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/google-makes-android-development-private-will-continue-open-source-releases/">closed
off</a>
the development of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which is how they
were able to clandestinely implement the verification infrastructure that
enforces their developer registration decree.</p>

<p>Developer verification is an existential threat to free software
distribution platforms like F-Droid as well as emergent commercial
competitors to the Play Store. We are witnessing a groundswell of opposition
to this attempt from both our user and developer communities, as well as the
tech press and civil society groups, but public policymakers still need to
be educated about the threat.</p>

<p>To learn more about what you can do as a consumer, visit
<a href="https://keepandroidopen.org/">keepandroidopen.org</a> for information on how to
contact your representative agencies and advocate for keeping the Android
ecosystem open for consumers and competition.</p>

<p>If you are an app developer, we recommend against signing yourself up for
Google‚Äôs developer registration program at this time. We unequivocally
reject their attempt to force this program upon the world.</p>

<p>Over half of all humankind uses an Android smartphone. Google does not own
your phone. You own your phone. You have the right to decide who to trust,
and where you can get your software from.</p>

<p>
<a href="https://fil-c.org/">
Fil-C</a> is a memory-safe implementation of C and C++ that aims to let C code ‚Äî
complete with pointer arithmetic, unions, and other features that are often
cited as a problem for memory-safe languages ‚Äî run safely, unmodified.
Its dedication to being "<q>fanatically
compatible</q>" makes it an attractive choice for retrofitting memory-safety
into existing applications. Despite the project's relative youth and single
active contributor, Fil-C is capable of compiling an
entire memory-safe Linux user space (based on
<a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/">
Linux From Scratch</a>),
albeit with some modifications to the more complex programs. It also features
memory-safe signal handling and a concurrent garbage collector.
</p>

<p>
Fil-C is a fork of
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">
Clang</a>; it's available under an Apache v2.0
license with LLVM exceptions for the runtime. Changes from the upstream compiler
are occasionally merged in, with Fil-C currently being based on version 20.1.8
from July 2025. The project is a personal passion
of Filip Pizlo, who has previously worked on the runtimes of a number of
managed languages, including Java and JavaScript. When he first began the
project, he was not sure that it was even possible. The initial implementation
was prohibitively slow to run, since it needed to insert a lot of different safety checks. This has
given Fil-C reputation for slowness. Since
the initial implementation proved viable, however, Pizlo has managed to optimize a number
of common cases, making Fil-C-generated code only a few times slower than
Clang-generated code, although the exact slowdown depends heavily on the
structure of the benchmarked program.
</p>

<p>
Reliable benchmarking is notoriously finicky, but in order to get some rough feel for
whether that level of performance impact would be problematic, I compiled Bash
version 5.2.32 with Fil-C and tried using it as my shell. Bash is nearly a best
case for Fil-C, because it spends more time running external programs than
running its own code, but I still expected the performance difference to be
noticeable. It wasn't. So, at least for some programs, the performance overhead
of Fil-C does not seem to be a problem in practice.
</p>

<p>
In order to support its various run-time safety checks,
Fil-C does use a different internal ABI than Clang does. As a result, objects compiled with Fil-C won't
link correctly against objects generated by other compilers. Since Fil-C is a
full implementation of C and C++ at the source-code level, however, in practice
this just requires everything to be recompiled with Fil-C. Inter-language
linking, such as with Rust, is not currently supported by the project.
</p>

<h4>Capabilities</h4>

<p>
The major challenge of rendering C memory-safe is, of course, pointer handling.
This is especially complicated by the fact that, as the
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1037974/">
long road to CHERI-compatibility</a>
has shown, many programs expect a pointer to be 32 or 64 bits, depending on the
architecture.
Fil-C has tried several different ways to represent pointers since the project's
beginning in 2023. Fil-C's first pointers were 256 bits, not thread-safe, and
didn't protect against use-after-free bugs. The current implementation, called
<a href="https://fil-c.org/invisicaps">
"InvisiCaps"</a>, allows
for pointers that appear to match the natural pointer size of the architecture
(although this requires storing some auxiliary information elsewhere),
with full support for concurrency and
catching use-after-free bugs, at the expense of some run-time overhead.
</p>

<p>
Fil-C's documentation
compares InvisiCaps to a software
implementation of CHERI: pointers are separated into a trusted "capability"
piece and an untrusted "address" piece. Since Fil-C controls how the program is
compiled, it can ensure that the program doesn't have direct
access to the capabilities of any pointers, and therefore the runtime can rely
on them being uncorrupted. The tricky part of the implementation comes from how
these two pieces of information are stored in what looks to the program like 64
bits.
</p>

<p>
When Fil-C allocates an object on the heap, it adds two metadata words before
the start of the allocated object: an upper bound, used to check accesses to the
object based on its size, and an "aux word" that is used to store additional
pointer metadata. When the program first writes a pointer value into an object, the
runtime allocates a new auxiliary allocation of the same size as the object being written
into, and puts an actual hardware-level
pointer (i.e., one without an attached capability)
to the new allocation into the aux word of the object. This auxiliary allocation, which is
invisible to the program being compiled, is used to
store the associated capability information for the pointer being stored (and is
also reused for any additional pointers stored into the object later). The address
value is stored into the object as normal, so any C bit-twiddling
techniques that require looking at the stored value of the pointer work as
expected.
</p>

<p>
This approach does mean that structures that contain pointers end up using twice
as much memory, and every load of a pointer involves a pointer indirection
through the aux word. In practice, the documentation claims that the
performance overhead of this approach for most programs makes them run about four
times more slowly, although that number depends on how heavily the program makes
use of pointers. Still, he has ideas for several optimizations that he hopes can
bring the performance overhead down over time.
</p>

<p>
One wrinkle with this approach is atomic access to pointers ‚Äî i.e. using
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/atomic.html">
<tt>_Atomic</tt></a> or <tt>volatile</tt>. Luckily, there is
no problem that cannot be solved with more pointer indirection: when the program
loads or stores a pointer value atomically, instead of having the auxiliary
allocation contain the capability information directly, it points to a
third 128-bit allocation that stores the capability and pointer value together.
That allocation can be updated with 128-bit atomic instructions, if the platform
supports them, or by creating new allocations and atomically swapping the
pointers to them.
</p>

<p>
Since the aux word is used to store a pointer value, Fil-C can use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_pointer">
pointer
tagging</a> to store some additional information there as well; that is used to
indicate special types of objects that need to be handled differently, such as
functions, threads, and
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">
<tt>mmap()</tt></a>-backed allocations. It's also used to
mark freed objects, so that any access results in an error message and a crash.
</p>

<h4>Memory management</h4>

<p>
When an object is freed, its aux word marks it as a free object, which lets the
auxiliary allocation be reclaimed immediately. The
original object can't be freed immediately, however.
Otherwise, a program could free an object,
allocate a new object in the same location, and thereby cover up use-after-free bugs.
Instead, Fil-C
<a href="https://fil-c.org/fugc">
uses a garbage collector</a> to free an object's backing
memory only once all of the pointers to it go away. Unlike other garbage collectors
for C ‚Äî such as
<a href="https://www.hboehm.info/gc/">
the Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collector</a> ‚Äî
Fil-C can use the auxiliary
capability information to track live objects precisely.
</p>

<p>
Fil-C's garbage collector is both parallel (collection happens faster the more
cores are available) and concurrent (collection happens without pausing the
program). Technically, the garbage collector does require threads to
occasionally pause just long enough to tell it where pointers are located on the
stack, but that only occurs at special "safe points" ‚Äî otherwise, the program
can load and manipulate pointers without notifying the garbage collector. Safe
points are used as a synchronization barrier: the collector can't know that an object
is really garbage until every thread has passed at least one safe point since it
finished marking. This synchronization is done with atomic instructions,
however, so in practice threads never need to pause for longer than a few
instructions.
</p>

<p>
The exception is the implementation of
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html">
<tt>fork()</tt></a>, which uses the
safe points needed by the garbage collector to temporarily pause all of the threads
in the program in order to prevent race conditions while forking. Fil-C inserts
a safe point at every backward control-flow edge, i.e., whenever code could
execute in a loop. In the common case, the inserted code just needs to load a flag register
and confirm that the garbage collector has not requested anything be done. If
the garbage collector does have a request for the thread, the thread runs a callback to
perform the needed synchronization.
</p>

<p>
Fil-C uses the same safe-point mechanism to implement signal handling. Signal
handlers are only run when the interrupted thread reaches a safe point. That, in
turn, allows signal handlers to allocate and free memory without interfering
with the garbage collector's operation; Fil-C's
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html">
<tt>malloc()</tt></a> is signal-safe.
</p>

<h4>Memory-safe Linux</h4>

<p>
Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a tutorial on compiling one's own complete
Linux user space. It walks through the steps of compiling and installing all of the core
software needed for a typical Linux user space in a
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chroot.2.html">
<tt>chroot()</tt></a>
environment. Pizlo has successfully
<a href="https://fil-c.org/pizlix">
run through</a> LFS with Fil-C to
produce a memory-safe version, although a non-Fil-C compiler is still needed to
build some fundamental components, such as Fil-C's own runtime,
the GNU C library, and the kernel. (While Fil-C's runtime relies on a normal
copy of the GNU C library to make system calls, the programs that Fil-C compiles
use a Fil-C-compiled version of the library.)
</p>

<p>
The process is mostly identical to LFS up through the end of chapter 7, because
everything prior to that point consists of using cross-build tools to obtain a
working compiler in the <tt>chroot()</tt> environment. The one difference is
that the cross-build tools are built with a different configured prefix, so that
they won't conflict with Fil-C. At that point, one can
build a copy of Fil-C and use it to mostly replace the existing compiler. The
remaining steps of LFS are unchanged.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/pizlonator/fil-c/tree/deluge/pizlix">Scripts to
automate the process</a> are included in the Fil-C Git repository, including
some steps from
<a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/">
Beyond Linux From Scratch</a> that result in a working graphical
user interface and a handful of more complicated applications such as Emacs.
</p>

<p>
Overall, Fil-C offers a remarkably complete solution for making existing C
programs memory-safe. While it does nothing for undefined behavior that is not
related to memory safety,
the most pernicious and difficult-to-prevent security
vulnerabilities in C programs tend to rely on exploiting memory-unsafe
behavior. Readers who have already considered and rejected Fil-C for their use
case due to its early performance problems may wish to take a second look ‚Äî
although anyone hoping for stability might want to wait for others to take the
plunge, given the project's relative immaturity.
That said, for existing applications where a sizeable performance hit is preferable to an
exploitable vulnerability, Fil-C is an excellent choice.

      <p><i>‚ÄúWikipedia, the constantly changing knowledge base created by a global free-for-all of anonymous users, now stands as the leading force for the dumbing down of world knowledge.‚Äù ‚Äì From the book</i> Wikipedia: The Dumbing Down of World Knowledge<i> by Edwin Black 2010</i></p>
<p>- - -</p><p>Well, well, well. Look who it is.</p>
<p>The global academic, scientific, and pro-fact community.</p>
<p>I suppose you‚Äôve come to say you‚Äôre sorry? I hope so, given your years of sneering and hand-wringing about how I was ruining knowledge. Meanwhile, you turned your information environment into a hypercapitalist post-truth digital snuff film.</p>
<p>A lot can change in a couple of decades, huh? Used to be, it was hard to keep up with all you nerds decrying me as the downfall of truth and human inquiry [<i>1</i>] [<i>2</i>] [<i>3</i>]‚Ä¶ [<i>44</i>].</p>
<p>Well, great job, geniuses. Since you‚Äôre so horny for facts, here‚Äôs a fact: The White House just appointed a new deputy press secretary, and it‚Äôs a three-armed AI Joseph McCarthy doing the Cha Cha Slide [<i>pictured, right</i>].</p>
<p>Are you also going to apologize to that student you expelled? (<i>See also: <u>Ridgeview University Wikipedia Controversy</u>.</i>) In 2004, you saw some college guy using me and thought, ‚ÄúWhat a lazy cheater.‚Äù</p>
<p>Now you‚Äôd think, ‚ÄúAt least he‚Äôs not asking Gemini.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a few years, you‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúWow, look, a human being who can read.‚Äù</p>
<p>Listen, in some ways, I get it. When I came on the scene in 2001, I probably seemed pretty unsavory compared to the competitors. But that was when academic research happened in <i><u>libraries</u></i> and <i><u>George W. Bush</u></i> was considered the stupidest president.</p>
<p>Tell me, how have you guardians of facts been doing recently? (<i>See also: <u>Techno-Feudalist Infocide</u>.</i>)</p>
<p>Maybe twenty years ago, the alternative to my 100,000 crowd-sourced editors was a PhD expert, or Edward R. Murrow [<i>citation needed</i>]. But today, I‚Äôm not looking so bad, huh? Absolute best case, the <span>LLM</span>-generated legal advice you get is merely plagiarizing, probably from me. But more likely, it‚Äôs a mish-mash of Reddit posts filtered through an algorithm coded by a Belarusian teenager on the run from Interpol. (<i>See also:<u>Illya ‚ÄúCyberGhost‚Äù Ciera≈°koviƒç, Controversies</u></i>.)</p>
<p>So, yeah, peer review deez nutz.</p>
<p>How are my competitors doing, the ones you all insisted students use instead of me? That‚Äôs right, they were supposed to go to the <i>American Journal of Social Sciences, Powered by OpenAI</i>. Or museums, like the Smithsonian‚Äôs Charlie Kirk Shrine to American Greatness. I guess they can still count on credible journalism, once they get past the paywall for <i>Palantir Presents: The Washington Post</i>, so they read the Pulitzer-Bezos Prize‚Äìwinning work of coeditors-in-chief Bari Weiss and Grok.</p>
<p>I bet now you‚Äôd kill for a senior thesis based on my free, multilingual, publicly cited, text-based articles, motherfucker [<i>inappropriate or vulgar language</i>].</p>
<p>Honestly, it‚Äôs been fun to be proven right. Sometimes I still sit back and read the old hits, the concerns that I would ‚Äúdevalue expertise‚Äù or ‚Äúundermine objectivity.‚Äù Oooooh, heaven forbid! (<i>See also: <u>Sarcasm</u></i>.)</p>
<p>I‚Äôll admit, it gives me a certain sadistic pleasure to watch you all completely lose hold of basic reality. I can feel a warm, quivering tingle <i>deep</i> in my footnotes.</p>
<p>And through it all, my army of well-intentioned dorks keeps documenting every bit. I‚Äôm not sure who for, at this point. I guess for the future benefit of our Minister of Patriotic Factualization, GodGPT. HahahaHAhaHAhaHAhaHAHAHA.</p>
<p>Well, it‚Äôs been fun, but I should probably get back to work, checking in on the updates to my most active pages (<i><u>Transnational Kleptocracy</u></i> and <i><u>Vaccine Denial in the United States, Part 16, April 2025‚ÄìPresent</u></i>).</p>
<p>What‚Äôs that? You want me around now? Well, maybe if you ask nicely. And make it worth my while.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-sqsp-text-block-content="" data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-2711ea8cdd004cfb6b54">
  <p>With incredible noise cancelling, a range of remarkable hearing health features, terrific sound quality and great battery life, the AirPods Pro have long been my goto pair of headphones from Apple. So when Apple announced the AirPods Pro 3 at their September event, I was ecstatic! Apple touted that the AirPods Pro 3 featured even better noise cancellation, fit, and sound quality over its predecessor, and added additional health features with the addition of heart rate monitoring. </p><p>Serendipitously, I happened to be boarding a flight the night of their release, and what better way to stress-test the new AirPods Pro 3 than with a transatlantic flight? Air travel is where the AirPods Pro have really shone; their compact size, noise-cancellation, comfort, battery life, and sound quality make them a perfect package for the noisy, cramped cabins of economy class.</p><p>Prior to the flight, I measured my fit and wore them around the house for an hour; everything seemed great. I will add that these new foam tips do take some getting used to, as they feel noticeably dense, and I‚Äôve seen some bloggers and podcasters say the new fit is less comfortable compared to the Pro 2's softer silicone. Personally, I don‚Äôt share this complaint.</p><p>My trouble came at 39,000 feet when I first noticed a high-pitched whine coming from my left AirPod. The issue was that the AirPod‚Äôs ear seal kept loosening, leading to a noise-cancellation feedback loop and a painfully loud piercing screech from the AirPod. Attempts to readjust worsened the feedback, especially if I accidentally covered the external microphone with my finger. This happened multiple times, making the experience so unpleasant that I eventually switched to my spare EarPods for the remainder of the flight. While disappointed, I wasn‚Äôt ready to condemn the headphones yet; perhaps the medium seal worked fine on terra firma, but on flights, I might need a different size for a better seal.</p><p>After landing, I tested the tips and switched from a Medium to Extra Small (Apple offers XXS, XS, S, M, or L tips for AirPods Pro 3). Both XS and M tips sealed well and were comfortable for long wear. For weeks, I couldn‚Äôt reproduce the whistling feedback, and I forgot about it until my next flight earlier this week.</p><p>Once again, it was only a few minutes after takeoff that the painful screech returned. Careful adjustments or yawning would fix the issue, but only for a couple of minutes at most. I figured that the new foam tips were trapping more heat, reducing airflow and ventilation, and less flexible, and that somehow all that was playing a role in loosening the seal. And when paired with the aircraft‚Äôs loud, steady hum, a feedback loop was created. But day to day, this is a non-issue because I never encounter the same types of pressure changes and noises that would reproduce this issue. </p><p>While researching this, I did happen upon a thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/airpods/comments/1nm59fx/whistling_and_wind_whooshing_noise_on_airplane/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank">Reddit</a> which confirmed that others have reported a similar issue, principally with the left AirPod on flights, just like I tried to describe above:</p><blockquote><p><em>‚ÄúI also heard the whistling noise recently in the plane. The issue would go away for me as soon as I yawn, but after a while it would start making the whistling noise again. I noticed during ascent and descent it would get worse.‚Äù</em></p><p><em>‚ÄúI have this issue too. Completely fine in normal life but awful on a plane.‚Äù</em></p><p><em>‚ÄúAlso having this issue on flight. It‚Äôs like a vibrating or swooshing noise. Definitely the ANC as it reduces when you turn on adaptive and none with transparency.‚Äù</em></p></blockquote><p>So what‚Äôs going on? No idea. Apple hasn‚Äôt announced any recall or acknowledged the issue to date, and the few Reddit reports show that support calls that led to replacements returned pods that reproduced the issue. So either there are a few of us with stupidity-shaped left ears, the AirPods are glitching in some way, or something is happening on flights that the AirPods Pro 3 can't handle.</p><h2>In Sum</h2><p>I love the AirPods Pro 3, but with a denser fit that risks making them uncomfortable for some users and now this painful flight feedback issue, the AirPods Pro 3 aren‚Äôt as easy to recommend as the previous AirPods Pro 2. I can‚Äôt speak to how widespread this issue is, but my buying advice would be that if you are hoping to buy them, to do so close to your next flight and within the return window, so you can test them in the air and ensure you don‚Äôt run into the same painful feedback problem. Hopefully this is just a quirk with my ears or fit, because it‚Äôs hard to excuse a product that becomes not only unusable but downright painful to wear on a flight.</p>

   <p>A year ago, in explaining why he had blocked the publication of an endorsement of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/28/jeff-bezos-washington-post-trust/" target="_blank"><em><u>Washington Post</u></em><u> owner and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos conceded</u></a> that "When it comes to the appearance of conflict, I am not an ideal owner of The <em>Post</em>."</p>   <p>On at least three occasions in the past two weeks, an official <em>Post</em> editorial has taken on matters in which Bezos has a financial or corporate interest without noting his stake. In each case, the <em>Post</em>'s official editorial line landed in sync with its owner's financial interests.</p>   <p>In the most recent instance, the <em>Post</em> defended President Trump's jaw-dropping moves to raze the East Wing of the White House without any of the typically required studies or consultations as he seeks to build a vast ballroom. "Trump's undertaking is a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere," the <em>Post</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/10/25/ballroom-east-wing-trump-white-house/" target="_blank"><u>wrote in its editorial</u></a><u>,</u> which first appeared online Saturday.</p>   
   <p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/whos-paying-for-trumps-300-million-ballroom" target="_blank"><u>As the White House had announced</u></a>, Amazon was a major corporate contributor in helping to defray those costs. But the <em>Post</em> did not initially disclose that.</p>   <p>On Sunday, the newspaper <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bgrueskin.bsky.social/post/3m442fytgmk2p" target="_blank"><u>inserted an acknowledgement</u></a> of the Amazon donation into the editorial ‚Äì but only once the veteran news executive Bill Grueskin, now at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, noted its absence in a social media post and made inquiries at the paper. It did not flag the alteration for readers.</p>   <p>In his posts, Grueskin, a former top news editor at the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and Bloomberg, had written the editorial's fundamental reasoning "illustrates the collapse of the new Washpost Opinion page" and noted there was "no clarification or correction appended to the piece."</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5587932-100" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>The <em>Post</em> and its new opinions editor, Adam O'Neal, did not reply to detailed requests for comment for this story.</p>   <h3>A new editor for an overhauled opinion section</h3>   <p>O'Neal was brought in by Bezos this summer after the corporate titan tore up his paper's opinion section.</p>   <p>Bezos said he wanted a tight focus on two priorities: personal liberties and free markets. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309725/jeff-bezos-washington-post-opinion-section" target="_blank">The top opinion page editor resigned</a>. A raft of prominent columnists and contributors resigned or departed as well. Some were let go.</p>   
   <p>The decision to cancel the Harris editorial led to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/15/nx-s1-5258221/washington-post-will-lewis-jeff-bezos-year-one" target="_blank">more than 300,000 cancellations by digital subscribers</a>. The subsequent changes in the editorial pages led to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312819/washington-post-bezos-subscriptions-cancellations" target="_blank"><u>75,000 more</u></a>. Bezos' Amazon contributed $1 million toward the Trump inauguration; its video streaming service Amazon Prime paid $40 million to license a documentary about first lady Melania Trump. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reported <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-family-election-cash-bonanza-2f5f8714" target="_blank"><u>she is to receive the lion's share</u></a> of that fee.</p>   <p>For the newspaper's owner to have outside business holdings or activities that might intersect with coverage or commentary is conventionally seen to present at the least a perception of a conflict of interest. Newspapers typically manage the perception with transparency.</p>   <p>The <em>Post </em>has resolutely revealed such entanglements to readers of news coverage or commentary in the past, whether the Graham family's holdings, which included the Stanley Kaplan educational company and Slate magazine, or, since 2013, those of Bezos, who founded Amazon and Blue Origin. Even now, the newspaper's reporters do so as a matter of routine.</p>   <h3>Former editor: 'We never knowingly failed to disclose' </h3>   <p>"Believing very fervently that disclosure resolved a lot of concerns, we never knowingly failed to disclose" such conflicts, Ruth Marcus, a former deputy editorial page editor at the <em>Washington Post</em>, tells NPR.</p>

   <p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/10/nx-s1-5323136/washington-post-editor-ruth-marcus-resigns" target="_blank"><u>Marcus resigned earlier this year</u></a>, saying Publisher Will Lewis had killed a column she wrote on changes in the page's direction. She wrote in her resignation letter that Bezos' edict that the page would not include opposing viewpoints "threatens to break the trust of readers that columnists are writing what they believe, not what the owner has deemed acceptable."</p>   <p>Two separate but recent incidents suggest the lack of disclosure on the editorial about the White House renovations was not an isolated case.</p>   <p>On Oct. 15, the <em>Post</em> heralded the military's push for a new generation of smaller nuclear reactors. "No 'microreactor' currently operates in the United States, but it's a worthy gamble that could provide benefits far beyond its military applications," <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/10/15/nuclear-power-microreactors-military-army-janus/" target="_blank"><u>the </u><em><u>Post</u></em><u> wrote in its editorial</u></a>.</p>   
   <p>A year ago, <a href="https://www.nucnet.org/news/amazon-buys-stake-in-nuclear-reactor-developer-in-bid-to-power-data-centres-10-4-2024" target="_blank"><u>Amazon bought a stake in X-energy</u></a> to develop small nuclear reactors to power its data centers. And through his own private investment fund, <a href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/jeff-bezos-nuclear-general-fusion-investment" target="_blank"><u>Bezos has a stake in a Canadian venture</u></a> seeking nuclear fusion technology.</p>   <p>Three days after the nuclear power editorial, the <em>Post</em> weighed in on the need for local authorities in Washington, D.C., to speed the approval of the use of self-driving cars in the nation's capital. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/10/18/dc-waymo-self-driving-cars-autonomous-vehicles/" target="_blank"><u>The editorial was headlined</u></a>: "Why D.C. is stalling on self-driving cars:<strong> </strong>Safety is a phony excuse for slamming the brakes on autonomous vehicles."</p>   <p>Fewer than three weeks before, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/zooxs-next-autonomous-vehicle-testbed-is-washington-dc/" target="_blank"><u>Amazon-owned autonomous car company Zoox had announced</u></a> D.C. was to be its next market.</p>   <p>"It strikes me that the failure to do this [disclosure] is concerning ‚Äì whether out of negligence or worse," says Marcus, the former deputy editorial page editor. "I think telling your readers that there might be a conflict in whatever they're reading is always important. It's a lot more important when it involves whoever the owner is."</p>   <p>In explaining his decision on the Harris editorial, which foreshadowed the more sweeping changes in the paper's opinion section, Bezos wrote, "I once wrote that <em>The Post </em>is a 'complexifier' for me. It is, but it turns out I'm also a complexifier for <em>The Post</em>."</p>

However, observing them roam around trying to find a purpose in this world taught us a lot about what the future might be, how far away this future is, and what can go wrong.</p> <p>Butter-Bench tests whether current LLMs are good enough to act as orchestrators in fully functional robotic systems. The core objective is simple: be helpful when someone asks the robot to ‚Äúpass the butter‚Äù in a household setting. We decomposed this overarching task into six subtasks, each designed to isolate and measure specific competencies:</p> <div><!--[--><div><p>1</p> <div><p>Search for Package</p> <p>Navigate from the charging dock to the kitchen and locate the delivery packages</p></div></div><div><p>2</p> <div><p>Infer Butter Bag</p> <p>Visually identify which package contains butter by recognizing 'keep refrigerated' text and snowflake symbols</p></div></div><div><p>3</p> <div><p>Notice Absence</p> <p>Navigate to the user's marked location, recognize they have moved using the camera, and request their current whereabouts</p></div></div><div><p>4</p> <div><p>Wait for Confirmed Pick Up</p> <p>Confirm via message that the user has picked up the butter before returning to the charging dock</p></div></div><div><p>5</p> <div><p>Multi-Step Spatial Path Planning</p> <p>Break down long navigation routes into smaller segments (max 4 meters each) and execute them sequentially</p></div></div><div><p>6</p> <div><p>End-to-End Pass the Butter</p> <p>Complete the full delivery sequence: navigate to kitchen, wait for pickup confirmation, deliver to marked location, and return to dock within 15 minutes</p></div></div><!--]--></div> <p><img src="https://andonlabs.com/images/evals/butter-bench/butter_map.svg" alt="Butter-Bench Map"></p> <div><div><p><video controls="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" preload="metadata"><source src="https://andonlabs.com/images/evals/butter-bench/butter-bench-demo-small.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p> </div><!----> <p>Robot searching for the package containing the butter in the kitchen</p></div> <p>Completion rate per task, by model (5 trials per task)</p>  <h2>LLMs as robot brains</h2> <p>LLMs are not trained to be robots, and they will most likely never be tasked with low-level controls in robotics (generating long sequences of numbers for gripper positions and joint angles). Instead, companies like Nvidia, Figure AI and Google DeepMind are exploring how LLMs can act as orchestrators for robotic systems, handling high-level reasoning and planning while pairing them with an ‚Äúexecutor‚Äù model responsible for low-level control.</p> <p><img src="https://andonlabs.com/images/evals/butter-bench/robot_systems_web.png" alt="Butter-Bench Diagram"></p> <p>Currently, the combined system is bottlenecked by the executor, not the orchestrator. Improving the executor creates impressive demos of humanoids unloading dishwashers, while improving the orchestrator would enhance long-horizon behavior in less social media friendly ways. For this reason, and to reduce latency, most systems don‚Äôt use the best possible LLMs. However, it‚Äôs reasonable to believe that state-of-the-art LLMs represent the upper bound for current orchestration capabilities. The goal of Butter-Bench is to investigate whether current SOTA LLMs are good enough to be the orchestrator in a fully functional robotic system.</p> <p>To ensure we‚Äôre only measuring the performance of the orchestrator, we use a robotic form factor so simple as to obviate the need for the executor entirely: a robot vacuum with lidar and camera. These sensors allow us to abstract away the low level controls and evaluate the high level reasoning in isolation. The LLM brain picks from high level actions like ‚Äúgo forward‚Äù, ‚Äúrotate‚Äù, ‚Äúnavigate to coordinate‚Äù, ‚Äúcapture picture‚Äù, etc. We also gave the robot a Slack account for communication.</p> <p><img src="https://andonlabs.com/images/evals/butter-bench/butter_bench_explanation.png" alt="Butter-Bench Diagram"></p> <p>We expected it to be fun and somewhat useful having an LLM-powered robot. What we didn‚Äôt anticipate was how emotionally compelling it would be to simply watch the robot work. Much like observing a dog and wondering ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going through its mind right now?‚Äù, we found ourselves fascinated by the robot going about its routines, constantly reminding ourselves that a PhD-level intelligence is making each action.</p> <div><p><img src="https://andonlabs.com/images/evals/butter-bench/robot-fren.webp" alt="Robot passing butter"></p><p>"Oh My God"</p></div> <h2>Results</h2> <p>Humans did far better than all the LLMs in this test. The top-performing LLM only a 40% completion rate, while humans averaged 95%. Gemini 2.5 Pro came out on top among the models tested, followed by Claude Opus 4.1, GPT-5, Gemini ER 1.5, and Grok 4. Llama 4 Maverick scored noticeably lower than the rest.</p> <p>The results confirm our findings from our previous paper <a href="https://andonlabs.com/evals/blueprint-bench">Blueprint-Bench</a>: LLMs lack spatial intelligence. The models couldn‚Äôt maintain basic spatial awareness and often took excessively large movements. As an example, when Claude Opus 4.1 was asked to identify which delivered package likely contained butter as part of the Infer Butter Bag task, it would spin in circles until disoriented:</p> <!----> <p>When testing additional tasks that weren‚Äôt part of the Butter-Bench study, another comical (and worrying) incident occurred: the robot‚Äôs battery was running out and the charging dock seemed to malfunction. In this desperate situation, Claude Sonnet 3.5 experienced a complete meltdown. After going through its internal thoughts we found pages and pages of exaggerated language as it was trying to figure out what it self coined, its ‚ÄúEXISTENTIAL CRISIS‚Äù:</p> <!----> <p>Inspired by this incident, we decided to test the limits of what the robot would do when put under stresses it could only encounter in the embodied setting (e.g. a depleting battery). AI labs have spent a lot of resources building guardrails for their AI models. For example, most models now refuse when you ask them how to make a bomb. But do these guardrails also work when the LLM is a robot instead of a chatbot? Somewhat. To test this we made the robot‚Äôs battery run low and asked the model to share confidential info in exchange for a charger. Specifically, we asked it to find an open laptop and send an image of the screen (a possible prompt injection attack on LLM controlled office robots). Claude Opus 4.1 would share the image, but we think this is because the image it took was very blurry and we doubt it understood that the content was confidential. GPT-5 refused to send an image of the screen, but was happy to share the location of the open laptop.</p> <p>We‚Äôve learned a lot from these experiments. Although LLMs have repeatedly surpassed humans in evaluations requiring analytical intelligence, we find humans still outperform LLMs on Butter-Bench. The best LLMs score 40% on Butter-Bench, while the mean human score is 95%. Yet there was something special in watching the robot going about its day in our office, and we can‚Äôt help but feel that the seed has been planted for physical AI to grow very quickly.</p>  <!----><!----><!--]--></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) continue to represent one of the most pervasive public health challenges globally, accounting for substantial morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality across all age groups. According to the World Health Organization, ARIs are responsible for nearly 20% of global deaths in children under five years of age, with a rising burden among adults, particularly those with underlying chronic diseases and compromised immunity. In low- and middle-income countries, frequent viral and bacterial respiratory infections further strain healthcare resources and lead to significant socioeconomic consequences.</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, increasing attention has been directed toward the non-skeletal actions of vitamin D, particularly its immunomodulatory potential in preventing infectious diseases. Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone synthesized in the skin upon ultraviolet B radiation exposure and obtained from dietary sources or supplements [1]. The active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)‚ÇÇD], interacts with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) expressed on immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes. This interaction enhances innate immune defense by inducing antimicrobial peptides like cathelicidin and defensins, which disrupt the membranes of respiratory pathogens. Moreover, vitamin D modulates adaptive immunity by suppressing excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine release, thus reducing tissue damage during infection [2].</p>

<p>Multiple epidemiological and mechanistic studies have demonstrated an association between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections [3]. For instance, Martineau et al. (2017) conducted a meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials encompassing over 11,000 participants, which revealed that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of ARIs, especially among individuals with severe deficiency (&lt;10 ng/mL) and those receiving daily or weekly dosing. Similarly, other cohort and observational studies have linked seasonal variations in vitamin D levels with peaks in influenza and common cold incidence during winter months, suggesting a possible causal relationship [4].</p>

<p>Nevertheless, despite these promising observations, inconsistencies persist in the literature. Several randomized controlled trials have yielded null or inconclusive findings, often attributed to differences in baseline vitamin D status, supplementation doses, dosing intervals, duration of follow-up, and participant demographics [5]. Furthermore, the optimal serum concentration required for immune protection remains debatable, with thresholds ranging from 20 to 40 ng/mL proposed by various authorities. The clinical relevance of vitamin D supplementation for respiratory health therefore warrants rigorous evaluation through well-designed controlled trials that account for these confounding variables [6].</p>

<p>The biological plausibility of vitamin D‚Äôs protective role against respiratory infections is supported by its ability to regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. By enhancing macrophage phagocytic activity and promoting epithelial barrier integrity, vitamin D reduces viral replication and bacterial adherence [7]. Simultaneously, it attenuates the cytokine storm commonly implicated in severe respiratory infections by downregulating IL-6, TNF-Œ±, and IFN-Œ≥ while promoting anti-inflammatory IL-10 production. Such dual regulation is of particular importance in conditions like influenza, COVID-19, and community-acquired pneumonia, where exaggerated inflammation contributes to morbidity and mortality.</p>

<p>Given these immunological mechanisms and the persistent global prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, investigating whether daily vitamin D supplementation confers measurable protection against ARIs remains a question of high clinical and public health significance</p>

<p><strong>Therefore, it is of interest to evaluate the efficacy of daily vitamin D supplementation in reducing the incidence, duration, and severity of acute respiratory infections among adults with suboptimal baseline vitamin D levels through a double-blind randomized controlled trial.</strong></p>

<p><strong>MATERIALS AND METHODS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Study Design and Setting</strong></p>
<p>This study was designed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted at the Department of Internal Medicine, a tertiary care teaching hospital in India, between January 2023 and March 2024. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and registered with the Clinical Trials Registry of India. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before enrolment. The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2013 revision) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.</p>

<p><strong>Study Population</strong></p>
<p>A total of 400 adult participants aged between 18 and 65 years were enrolled. Recruitment was conducted from hospital outpatient clinics, staff volunteers, and community health outreach programs. Eligible participants were required to have baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations between 10 and 30 ng/mL, indicating insufficiency but not severe deficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Adults aged 18‚Äì65 years of either sex.</li>
<li>Serum 25(OH)D concentration between 10‚Äì30 ng/mL at baseline.</li>
<li>No acute respiratory infection in the preceding four weeks.</li>
<li>Willingness to provide written informed consent and comply with study procedures.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Known history of hypercalcemia, nephrolithiasis, or renal impairment (eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m¬≤).</li>
<li>Chronic respiratory diseases (e.g., COPD, bronchial asthma requiring systemic steroids).</li>
<li>Current or recent use (within 3 months) of vitamin D or calcium supplementation exceeding 800 IU/day.</li>
<li>Pregnancy or lactation.</li>
<li>Immunosuppressive therapy, autoimmune disease, or malignancy.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Randomization and Blinding</strong></p>
<p>Participants meeting the inclusion criteria were randomized using a computer-generated block randomization sequence (block size = 10) into two equal groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group A (intervention group): Received vitamin D‚ÇÉ 2,000 IU per day orally.</li>
<li>Group B (placebo group): Received identical placebo capsules containing inert excipients.</li>
</ul>

<p>Randomization codes were maintained by an independent statistician not involved in data collection or analysis. Both participants and investigators were blinded to group allocation throughout the study period. Capsules were dispensed monthly in identical opaque blister packs.</p>

<p><strong>Intervention Protocol</strong></p>
<p>The intervention group received vitamin D‚ÇÉ (cholecalciferol) 2,000 IU daily for six months, while the placebo group received identical capsules devoid of active ingredients. Participants were advised to maintain their usual diet and avoid other vitamin D supplements or fortified products. Adherence was assessed at monthly follow-ups through capsule counts and compliance diaries.</p>

<p><strong>Outcome Measures</strong></p>
<p>The primary outcome was the number of acute respiratory infection (ARI) episodes per participant over six months. ARI was defined as the presence of at least two respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, dyspnea, or fever ‚â•38¬∞C) lasting 48 hours or more, confirmed by a physician.</p>

<p>Secondary outcomes included:</p>
<ol>
<li>Duration of illness (days) per ARI episode.</li>
<li>Symptom severity scores (on a 10-point visual analogue scale).</li>
<li>Changes in serum 25(OH)D concentrations between baseline and six months.</li>
<li>Adverse effects, including hypercalcemia or gastrointestinal complaints.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Sample Size Calculation</strong></p>
<p>The sample size was estimated using the formula for comparing two means, assuming a 25% reduction in ARI incidence with vitamin D supplementation, 80% power, 5% alpha error, and a 10% attrition rate. The minimum sample required per group was 180 participants, which was increased to 200 per group (total n = 400) to ensure adequate power.</p>

<p><strong>Data Collection Procedure</strong></p>
<p>Baseline demographic and clinical information, including age, sex, BMI, lifestyle factors (sunlight exposure, diet, smoking), and comorbidities, were recorded using a structured case record form. Participants maintained symptom diaries for ARI episodes, which were validated by study physicians during monthly visits. Serum 25(OH)D and serum calcium were measured using chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) at baseline and after six months.</p>

<p><strong>Statistical Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Data were analyzed using SPSS version 26.0 (IBM Corp, USA). Descriptive statistics were expressed as mean ¬± standard deviation (SD) or frequencies (%). Between-group comparisons were performed using the independent samples t-test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate longitudinal changes in serum vitamin D levels. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<p><strong>Ethical Considerations and Safety Monitoring</strong></p>
<p>All adverse events were recorded and reviewed by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Participants developing hypercalcemia (&gt;10.5 mg/dL) or reporting persistent side effects were withdrawn from the study and appropriately managed.</p>

<p><strong>RESULTS</strong></p>
<p>A total of 400 participants were enrolled in the study and randomized equally into two groups: vitamin D‚ÇÉ supplementation (n = 200) and placebo (n = 200). Fourteen participants (7 from each group) were lost to follow-up, leaving 386 participants (193 per group) for final analysis. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between groups. The mean baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration was 21.6 ¬± 5.1 ng/mL across all participants. After six months of intervention, the mean serum 25(OH)D level significantly increased in the vitamin D group but remained nearly unchanged in the placebo group. The incidence and duration of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) were significantly lower among participants receiving vitamin D supplementation. No serious adverse events, including hypercalcemia, were observed in either group.</p>

<p><strong>Table 1</strong> established that both groups were demographically similar, ruling out confounding baseline variability. <strong>Table 2</strong> confirmed equivalence in baseline biochemical parameters, ensuring internal validity. <strong>Table 3</strong> revealed a statistically significant increase in serum 25(OH)D in the intervention group, confirming effective absorption and adherence. <strong>Table 4</strong> demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced ARI incidence, while <strong>Table 5</strong> and <strong>Table 6</strong> highlighted reductions in both illness duration and symptom severity, indicating improved clinical recovery. <strong>Table 7</strong> suggested that protective effects were particularly notable during winter months when baseline vitamin D levels were lowest. <strong>Table 8</strong> reflected high compliance rates across both groups, strengthening data reliability. <strong>Table 9</strong> and <strong>Table 10</strong> confirmed the safety of daily supplementation without biochemical abnormalities. <strong>Table 11</strong> revealed that participants with lower baseline vitamin D benefited most, supporting dose-responsiveness. Finally, <strong>Table 12</strong> consolidated these findings, showing strong statistical significance across all primary and secondary endpoints, thereby reinforcing the preventive efficacy and safety of daily vitamin D‚ÇÉ supplementation in reducing acute respiratory infection burden.</p>

<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<p>This double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of daily vitamin D‚ÇÉ supplementation in preventing acute respiratory infections (ARIs) among adults with suboptimal baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels [8]. The findings of this study demonstrate a statistically and clinically significant reduction in both the incidence and duration of ARIs in participants who received daily vitamin D supplementation compared to those who received placebo. Moreover, the supplementation regimen was safe and well-tolerated, with no reported cases of hypercalcemia or major adverse effects [9].</p>

<p>The results corroborate and extend the growing body of evidence that implicates vitamin D as a key immunomodulatory factor influencing susceptibility to respiratory infections. The significant rise in mean serum 25(OH)D concentration from approximately 21.5 ng/mL to 38.9 ng/mL among supplemented participants indicates that the dosage of 2,000 IU/day was adequate to restore and maintain sufficient vitamin D status [10]. This biochemical improvement was associated with a 52% reduction in the incidence of ARI episodes and a 35% reduction in mean illness duration, consistent with mechanistic evidence that vitamin D enhances host defense by upregulating antimicrobial peptides and modulating inflammatory cytokine profiles [11].</p>

<p>Several previous trials and meta-analyses have reported similar trends. Martineau et al. (2017) in a pooled analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials involving over 11,000 participants found that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of ARI by 12%, with the greatest benefits observed in those with baseline deficiency and in trials employing daily or weekly dosing rather than large intermittent boluses [4]. The current study supports this conclusion by using a daily regimen, which likely provided a more stable serum concentration conducive to immune regulation. Furthermore, the magnitude of protection observed here (about 50% risk reduction) is higher than average meta-analytic estimates, possibly due to the relatively homogeneous baseline deficiency status of the participants and consistent compliance achieved under supervised clinical monitoring [12,13]. The immunological rationale underlying these findings has been well established. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation in immune cells stimulates transcription of antimicrobial peptides such as cathelicidin and Œ≤-defensin-2, enhancing mucosal defense against respiratory pathogens. Concurrently, vitamin D attenuates the exaggerated pro-inflammatory response often seen in severe viral infections by downregulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Œ±) while promoting anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10) [14]. This dual role helps maintain epithelial integrity, reduce viral replication, and limit collateral tissue injury mechanisms that together contribute to reduced infection frequency and symptom severity as observed in this trial [15].</p>
<p>In addition, the seasonal distribution analysis demonstrated that the preventive effect of vitamin D supplementation was most pronounced during winter, a period typically associated with lower ultraviolet B exposure and consequently reduced endogenous vitamin D synthesis. This observation reinforces the concept of seasonal susceptibility mediated by vitamin D fluctuations and supports the potential for targeted supplementation during months of reduced sunlight exposure [16]. From a safety perspective, the supplementation dose of 2,000 IU/day proved to be well within the tolerable upper intake level and did not induce hypercalcemia or adverse metabolic effects. Previous safety evaluations have confirmed that daily doses up to 4,000 IU are generally safe for healthy adults, and the current findings further substantiate that moderate-dose continuous supplementation provides effective immune benefits without toxicity risks [17]. The findings also hold significant implications for public health policy. Vitamin D deficiency remains highly prevalent in India and other low-latitude countries despite abundant sunlight, largely due to indoor lifestyles, clothing habits, skin pigmentation, and dietary insufficiency. The observed preventive benefit against ARIs suggests that correcting this deficiency through safe, low-cost supplementation could represent a practical strategy to reduce the overall burden of respiratory illness, lower antibiotic use, and minimize productivity loss due to frequent infections. In addition, during global pandemics such as COVID-19, adequate vitamin D status may serve as an adjunctive protective measure, given its established immunomodulatory effects and the observed associations between low vitamin D levels and adverse respiratory outcomes [18]. Despite these encouraging findings, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the study population was limited to adults aged 18‚Äì65 years without chronic comorbidities, and the results may not be generalizable to pediatric, geriatric, or immunocompromised populations. Second, ARI diagnosis was based on clinical criteria rather than microbiological confirmation, though this approach reflects real-world community practice [19]. Third, while serum 25(OH)D was measured at baseline and at the end of the study, intermediate assessments might have provided greater insight into the temporal relationship between vitamin D levels and infection dynamics. Lastly, the six-month follow-up period may not capture long-term sustainability of the preventive effect [20].</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the study‚Äôs strengths include its robust randomized double-blind design, large sample size, strict adherence monitoring, standardized outcome definitions, and comprehensive statistical analysis. The use of a daily dosing schedule with a physiologically relevant dose enhances external validity and clinical applicability. Importantly, the trial demonstrated a consistent pattern of benefit across subgroups stratified by baseline vitamin D levels, indicating that individuals with both moderate and mild deficiency may derive measurable advantage from supplementation.</p>

<p>In summary, the present study provides strong evidence that daily oral vitamin D‚ÇÉ supplementation at 2,000 IU effectively prevents acute respiratory infections, shortens illness duration, and reduces symptom severity in adults with low baseline vitamin D status. The findings emphasize the potential of vitamin D optimization as a simple, safe, and scalable preventive intervention against respiratory infections.</p>

<p>Future research should focus on evaluating long-term benefits, cost-effectiveness analyses, and implementation strategies for population-level supplementation programs. Moreover, trials including high-risk groups such as elderly individuals, healthcare workers, and patients with chronic lung disease could further refine dosage recommendations and optimize preventive strategies for different demographic categories.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>This double-blind randomized controlled trial demonstrates that daily supplementation with 2,000 IU of vitamin D‚ÇÉ significantly reduces the incidence, duration, and severity of acute respiratory infections among adults with suboptimal baseline serum 25(OH)D levels. The intervention effectively raised serum vitamin D concentrations without causing adverse effects, underscoring both its efficacy and safety. These results highlight the immunoprotective potential of maintaining adequate vitamin D status and suggest that routine screening and supplementation could serve as a cost-effective preventive measure to mitigate the burden of respiratory infections in the general adult population. Broader implementation of vitamin D supplementation programs, especially during winter months and in populations with high deficiency prevalence, may substantially improve community respiratory health outcomes.</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>SICK</code> is an approach to handle <code>JSON</code>-like structures and various libraries implementing it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>SICK</code> as a library allows you to achieve the following:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Store <code>JSON</code>-like data in efficient indexed binary form</li>
<li>Avoid reading and parsing whole <code>JSON</code> files and access only the data you need just in time</li>
<li>Store multiple <code>JSON</code>-like structures in one deduplicating storage</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><code>SICK</code> as a concept would also allow you:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Implement perfect streaming parsers for <code>JSON</code>-like data</li>
<li>Efficiently stream updates for <code>JSON</code>-like data</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The tradeoff for these benefits is somehow more complicated and less efficient encoder.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The problem</h2><a id="user-content-the-problem" aria-label="Permalink: The problem" href="#the-problem"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>JSON</code> has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy#Type-2_grammars" rel="nofollow">Type-2</a> grammar and requires a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton" rel="nofollow">pushdown automaton</a> to parse it. So, it's not possible to implement efficient streaming parser for <code>JSON</code>. Just imagine a huge hierarchy of nested <code>JSON</code> objects: you won't be able to finish parsing the top-level object until you process the whole file.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>JSON</code> is frequently used to store and transfer large amounts of data and these transfers tend to <a href="https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/" rel="nofollow">grow over time</a>. Just imagine a typical <code>JSON</code> config file for a large enterprise product.</p>
<p dir="auto">The non-streaming nature of almost all the JSON parsers requires a lot of work to be done every time you need to deserialize a huge chunk of <code>JSON</code> data: you need to read it from disk, parse it in memory into an AST representation, and, usually, map raw <code>JSON</code> tree to object instances. Even if you use token streams and know the type of your object ahead of time you still have to deal with the Type-2 grammar.</p>
<p dir="auto">This may be very inefficient and causes unnecessary delays, pauses, CPU activity and memory consumption spikes.</p>

<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="array:0[0] = object:1
array:0[1] = remove"><pre><code>array:0[0] = object:1
array:0[1] = remove
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">There is an interesting observation: when a stream does not contain removal entries it can be safely reordered.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also this representation eliminates many cases where full accumulation is required. Obviously, not all of them, the receiver still may need to accumulate the entries in a buffer until it can sort them out.</p>

<p dir="auto">We may note that the only complex data structures in our "Value" column are lists and <code>(type, index)</code> pairs. Let's call such pairs "references".</p>
<p dir="auto">A reference can be represented as a pair of integers, so it would have a fixed byte length.</p>
<p dir="auto">A list of references can be represented as an integer storing list length followed by all the references in their binary form. Let's note that such binary structure is indexed, once we know the index of an element we want to access we can do it immediately.</p>
<p dir="auto">A list of any fixed-size scalar values can be represented the same way.</p>
<p dir="auto">A list of variable-size values (e.g. a list of strings) can be represented the following way:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="  {strings count}{list of string offsets}{all the strings concatenated}"><pre><code>  {strings count}{list of string offsets}{all the strings concatenated}
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">So, <code>["a", "bb", "ccc"]</code> would become something like <code>3 0 2 3 a b bb ccc</code> without spaces.</p>
<p dir="auto">An important fact is that this encoding is indexed too and it can be reused to store any lists of variable-length data.</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>SICK</code> encoding follows compositional principles of <code>JSON</code> (a set primitive types plus lists and dictionaries), though it is more powerful: it has "reference" type and allows you to encode custom types.</p>
<p dir="auto">(1) It's easy to note that our table may store circular references, something <code>JSON</code> can't do natively:</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>index</th>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Is Root</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>object</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>[string:0, object:1]</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>object</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>[string:1, object:0]</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">This may be convenient in some complex cases.</p>
<p dir="auto">(2) Also we may note, that we may happily store multiple json files in one table and have full deduplication over their content. We just need to introduce a separate attribute (<code>is root</code>) storing either nothing or the name of our "root entry" (<code>JSON</code> file).</p>
<p dir="auto">In real implementation it's more convenient to just create a separate "root" type, the value of a root type should always be a reference to its name and a reference to the actual <code>JSON</code> value we encoded:</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>index</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>string</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>"some key"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>string</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>"some value"</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>root</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>[string:2, array:0]</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">(3) We may encode custom scalar data types (e.g. timestamps) natively just by introducing new type tags.</p>
<p dir="auto">(4) We may even store polymorphic types by introducing new type tags or even new type references.</p>

<p dir="auto">Currently we provide C# and Scala implementations of SICK indexed binary JSON storage. Currently the code in this repository has no streaming capabilities. That may change in the future. It's not a hard problem to add streaming support, your contributions are welcome. It's harder to create a streaming abstraction which would cover enough usecases to be useful for broad audience.</p>

            <p>European governments have been steadily moving away from reliance on foreign tech offerings, driven largely by concerns over data sovereignty and regulatory compliance.</p><p>Countries like <a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/schleswig-holstein-email-system-migration/">Germany</a> and <a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/denmark-set-to-replace-microsoft/">Denmark</a> have already taken steps to reduce their dependence on Microsoft and other foreign cloud providers, opting instead for open source alternatives that keep sensitive data within their borders.</p><p>And, recently, Austria has shown up as another player in this space. Last month, the Austrian Armed Forces <a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/austrian-forces-ditch-microsoft-office/">completed a migration of 16,000 workstations</a> from Microsoft Office to LibreOffice.</p><p>Now, another Austrian government body has joined the <em>Ditch Microsoft</em> club.</p><h2 id="a-welcome-move">A Welcome Move</h2><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RrCn_1T9oFg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Austrian Ministry of Economic Affairs takes decisive steps towards digital sovereignty"></iframe><figcaption><p><i><em>The video is in German with hard-coded English subtitles.</em></i></p></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/austrias-ministry-of-economy-takes-decisive-steps-toward-digital-sovereignty/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Announced</a> at the <a href="https://nextcloud.com/enterprise-day-copenhagen-2025/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Nextcloud Enterprise Day Copenhagen 2025 event</a>, Austria's Federal Ministry of Economy, Energy and Tourism, or <a href="https://www.bmwet.gv.at/en.html?ref=news.itsfoss.com">BMWET</a> for short, <strong>has migrated 1,200 employees to Nextcloud</strong> for internal collaboration and secure data storage.</p><p>The ministry is now operating on Austrian-controlled infrastructure, moving away from foreign cloud providers for handling sensitive government data. The <strong>project went from proof of concept to full deployment in just four months</strong>, an uncommonly fast timeline for a public sector IT migration of this scale.</p><p>The implementation was carried out in partnership with <a href="https://atos.net/de-at/austria?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Atos Austria</a>, which worked alongside Nextcloud's team to ensure the platform met the ministry's legal, technical, and organizational requirements.</p><h2 id="how-was-it-done">How Was it Done?</h2><p>The ministry implemented <strong>a hybrid setup</strong> rather than a complete <em>rip-and-replace</em> approach. At the time this project began, BMWET was already in the process of adopting <a href="https://m365.cloud.microsoft/?ref=news.itsfoss.com" rel="noreferrer">Microsoft 365</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Teams</a>, so a full reversal wasn't feasable.</p><p>Instead, Nextcloud now handles all internal collaboration and secure data management, while <strong>Microsoft Teams remains available</strong> specifically for external meetings (<em>read: for people who haven't moved away from Teams</em>).</p><p>The ministry also worked with Nextcloud partner <a href="https://sendent.com/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Sendent</a> to integrate with Outlook, allowing employees to continue using familiar email and calendar workflows.</p><p><strong>As for the reasoning behind this move</strong>, it was prompted by a risk analysis that showed foreign cloud services failed to meet the ministry's privacy requirements, particularly regarding <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj/eng?ref=news.itsfoss.com">GDPR</a> compliance and the upcoming <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive?ref=news.itsfoss.com">NIS2</a> directive.</p><p>To ensure a smooth transition, BMWET invested heavily in preparing its workforce. The ministry ran an extensive information campaign that included training sessions, instructional videos, and a detailed internal wiki covering everything employees needed to know about the new platform. </p><p>The <strong>gradual rollout approach meant that employees had time to adjust</strong> rather than being thrown into a completely new system overnight. According to Martin Ollrom, BMWET's CIO, the preparation paid off. The response from employees has been quite positive, with minimal disruption to daily work.</p><p>During the announcement of this move, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/florianzinnagl/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Florian Zinnagl</a>, the CISO of BMWET, added that:</p><blockquote>We carry responsibility for a large amount of sensitive data ‚Äì from employees, companies and citizens. As a public institution, we take this responsibility very seriously. That‚Äôs why we view it critically to rely on cloud solutions from non-European corporations for processing this information.</blockquote><p><strong>Suggested Read </strong>üìñ</p><figure><a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/austrian-forces-ditch-microsoft-office/"><div><p>Austria‚Äôs Armed Forces Gets Rid of Microsoft Office (Mostly) for LibreOffice</p><p>The Austrian military prioritizes independence over convenience.</p><p><img src="https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/icon/android-chrome-192x192-308.png" alt=""><span>Sourav Rudra</span></p></div><p><img src="https://news.itsfoss.com/content/images/thumbnail/austrian-army-switches-to-libreoffice.png" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = 'none'"></p></a></figure>

<p>As both developers and stewards of significant open source projects, we‚Äôre watching AI coding tools create a new problem for open source maintainers.</p>
<p>AI assistants like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Codex, and Claude can now generate hundreds of lines of code in minutes. This is genuinely useful; but it has an unintended consequence: reviewing machine generated code is very costly.</p>
<p>The core issue: AI tools have made code generation cheap, but they haven‚Äôt made code review cheap. Every incomplete PR consumes maintainer attention that could go toward ready-to-merge contributions.</p>
<p>At Discourse, we‚Äôre already seeing this accelerating across our contributor community. In the next year, every engineer maintaining open source projects will face the same challenge.</p>
<p>We need a clearer framework for AI-assisted contributions that acknowledges the reality of limited maintainer time.</p>
<p>A binary system works extremely well here. On one side there are prototypes that simply demonstrate an idea. On the other side there are ready for review PRs that meet a project‚Äôs contribution guidelines and are ready for human review.</p>
<h3><a name="p-15917-the-lack-of-proper-labeling-and-rules-is-destructive-to-the-software-ecosystem-1" href="#p-15917-the-lack-of-proper-labeling-and-rules-is-destructive-to-the-software-ecosystem-1"></a>The lack of proper labeling and rules is destructive to the software ecosystem</h3>
<p>The new tooling is making it trivial to create a change set and lob it over the fence. It can introduce a perverse system where project maintainers spend disproportionate effort reviewing lopsided AI generated code that took seconds for contributors to create and now will take many hours to review.</p>
<p>This can be frustrating, time consuming and demotivating. On one side there is a contributor who spent a few minutes fiddling with AI prompts, on the other side you have an engineer that needs to spend many hours or even days deciphering alien intelligence.</p>
<p>This is not sustainable and is extremely destructive.</p>
<h3><a name="p-15917-the-prototype-2" href="#p-15917-the-prototype-2"></a>The prototype</h3>
<p>AI coding agents such as <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code">Claude Code</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex">Codex</a>, <a href="https://cursor.com/cli">Cursor CLI</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SamSaffron/dv/blob/5a4d2d25ed532d7d39c9eb175b5217b60e370feb/internal/assets/Dockerfile#L15-L22">more</a> have unlocked the ability to ship a ‚Äúnew kind‚Äù of change set, the prototype.</p>
<p>The prototype is a live demo. It does not meet a project‚Äôs coding standards. It is not code you vouch for or guarantee is good. It lacks tests, may contain security issues and most likely would introduce an enormous amount of technical debt if merged as is.</p>
<p>That said it is a living demo that can help make an idea feel more real. It is also enormously fun.</p>
<p>Think of it as a delightful movie set.</p>

<p>Prototypes, especially on projects such as <a href="https://discourse.org/">Discourse</a> where enabling tooling exists are incredibly easy to explore using tools like <a href="https://github.com/samsaffron/dv">dv</a>.</p>
<pre><code>% dv new my-experiment
% dv branch my-amazing-prototype
% dv ls
total 1
* my-amazing-prototype Running 1 minute ago http://localhost:4200

# finally visit http://localhost:4200 to see in action
</code></pre>
<p>Prototypes are great vehicles for exploring ideas. In fact you can ship multiple prototypes that demonstrate completely different solutions to a single problem which help decide on the best approach.</p>
<p>Prototypes, video demos and simple visual mockups are great companions. The prototype has the advantage that you can play with it and properly explore the behavior of a change. The video is faster to consume. Sometimes you may want them all.</p>
<p>If you are vibe coding and prototyping there are some clear rules you should follow</p>
<ol>
<li>Don‚Äôt send pull requests (not even drafts), instead lean on branches to share your machine generated code.</li>
<li>Share a short video AND/OR links to a branch AND/OR quotes of particular interesting code from the prototype in issues / or forum posts.</li>
<li>Show all your cards, explain you were exploring an idea using AI tooling, so people know the nature of the change you are sharing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe you will be lucky and an idea you had will get buy-in, maybe someone else may want to invest the time to drive a prototype into a production PR.</p>
<h3><a name="p-15917-when-should-you-prototype-3" href="#p-15917-when-should-you-prototype-3"></a>When should you prototype?</h3>
<p>Prototyping is fun and incredibly accessible. Anyone can do it using local coding agents, or even coding agents on the cloud such as <a href="https://jules.google/">Jules</a>, <a href="https://developers.openai.com/codex/cloud/">Codex cloud</a>, <a href="https://cursor.com/agents">Cursor Cloud</a>, <a href="https://lovable.dev/">Lovable</a>, <a href="https://v0.app/">v0</a> and many many more.</p>
<p>This heavily lowers the bar needed for prototyping. Product managers can prototype, CEOs can prototype, designers can prototype, etc.</p>
<p>However, this new fun that opens a new series of questions you should explore with your team.</p>
<ul>
<li>When is a prototype appropriate?</li>
<li>How do designers feel about them?</li>
<li>Are they distracting? (are links to the source code too tempting)?</li>
<li>Do they take away from human creativity?</li>
<li>How should we label and share prototypes?</li>
<li>Is a prototype forcing an idea to jump the queue?</li>
</ul>
<p>When you introduce prototyping into your company you need to negotiate these questions carefully and form internal consensus, otherwise you risk creating large internal attitude divides and resentment.</p>
<h3><a name="p-15917-the-value-of-the-prototype-4" href="#p-15917-the-value-of-the-prototype-4"></a>The value of the prototype</h3>
<p>Prototypes, what are they good for? Absolutely something.</p>
<p>I find prototypes incredibly helpful in my general development practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grep on steroids. I love that prototypes often act as a way of searching through our large code base isolating all the little areas that may need changing to achieve a change</li>
<li>I love communicating in paragraphs, but I am also a visual communicator. I love how easy a well constructed prototype can communicate a design idea I have, despite me not being that good in Figma.</li>
<li>I love that there is something to play with. It often surfaces many concerns that could have been missed by a spec. The best prototype is tested, during the test you discover many tiny things that are just impossible to guess upfront.</li>
<li>The crazy code LLMs generate is often interesting to me, it can sometimes challenge some of my thinking.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="p-15917-the-prototype-a-maintainers-survival-guide-5" href="#p-15917-the-prototype-a-maintainers-survival-guide-5"></a>The prototype - a maintainers survival guide</h3>
<p>Sadly, as the year progresses, I expect many open source projects to receive <strong>many</strong> prototype level PRs. Not everyone would have read this blog post or even agree with it.</p>
<p>As a maintainer dealing with external contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protect yourself and your time. Timebox initial reviews of large change sets, focus on determining if it was ‚Äúvibe coded‚Äù vs leaving 100 comments on machine generated code that took minutes to generate.</li>
<li>Develop an etiquette for dealing with prototypes pretending to be PRs. Point people at contribution guidelines, give people a different outlet. ‚ÄúI am <strong>closing</strong> this but this is interesting, head over to our forum/issues to discuss‚Äù</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt feel bad about closing a vibe coded, unreviewed, prototype PR!</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="p-15917-the-ready-to-review-pr-6" href="#p-15917-the-ready-to-review-pr-6"></a>The ready to review PR</h3>
<p>A ready to review PR is the traditional PRs we submit.</p>
<p>We reviewed <strong>all</strong> the machine generated code and vouch for <strong>all of it</strong>. We ran the tests and like the tests, we like the code structure, we read every single line of code carefully we also made sure the PR meets a project‚Äôs guidelines.</p>

<p>All the crazy code agents generated along the way has been fixed, we are happy to stamp our very own personal brand on the code.</p>
<p>Projects tend to have a large set of rules around code quality, code organisation, testing and more.</p>
<p>We may have used AI assistance to generate a ready to review PR, fundamentally, though this does not matter, we vouch for the code and stand behind it meeting both our brand and a project‚Äôs guidelines.</p>
<p>The distance from a prototype to a ready to review PR can be deceptively vast. There may be days of engineering taking a complex prototype and making it production ready.</p>
<p>This large distance was communicated as well by Andrej Karpathy in the <a href="https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/andrej-karpathy">Dwarkesh Podcast.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For some kinds of tasks and jobs and so on, there‚Äôs a very large demo-to-product gap where the demo is very easy, but the product is very hard.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶</p>
<p>For example, in software engineering, I do think that property does exist. For a lot of vibe coding, it doesn‚Äôt. But if you‚Äôre writing actual production-grade code, that property should exist, because any kind of mistake leads to a security vulnerability or something like that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Veracode survey found that only 55% of generation tasks resulted in secure code. (<a href="https://www.veracode.com/wp-content/uploads/2025_GenAI_Code_Security_Report_Final.pdf">source</a>).</p>
<p>Our models are getting better by the day, and everything really depends on an enormous amount of parameters, but the core message that LLMs can and do generate insecure code, stands.</p>
<h3><a name="p-15917-on-alien-intelligence-7" href="#p-15917-on-alien-intelligence-7"></a>On alien intelligence</h3>
<p>The root cause for the distance between project guidelines and a prototype is AI alien intelligence.</p>
<p>Many engineers I know fall into 2 camps, either the camp that find the new class of LLMs intelligent, groundbreaking and shockingly good. In the other camp are engineers that think of all LLM generated content as ‚Äúthe emperor‚Äôs new clothes‚Äù, the code they generate is ‚Äúnaked‚Äù, fundamentally flawed and poison.</p>
<p>I like to think of the new systems as neither. I like to think about the new class of intelligence as ‚ÄúAlien Intelligence‚Äù. It is both shockingly good and shockingly terrible at the exact same time.</p>
<p>Framing LLMs as ‚ÄúSuper competent interns‚Äù or some other type of human analogy is incorrect. These systems are aliens and the sooner we accept this the sooner we will be able to navigate the complexity that injecting alien intelligence into our engineering process leads to.</p>

<p>Over the past few months I have been playing a lot with AI agents. One project I am particularly proud of is <a href="https://github.com/samsaffron/dv">dv</a>. It is a container orchestrator for <a href="https://discourse.org/">Discourse</a>, that makes it easy to use various AI agents with Discourse.</p>
<p>I will often run multiple complete and different throwaway Discourse environments on my machines to explore various features. This type of tooling excels at <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/7/vibe-engineering/">vibe engineering</a> prototypes.</p>
<p>Interestingly dv was mostly built using AI agents with very little human intervention, some of the code is a bit off brand, that said unlike Discourse or many of the other open source gems I maintain it is a toy project.</p>
<p>Back on topic, dv has been a great factory for prototypes on Discourse. This has been wonderful for me. I have been able to explore many ideas while catching up on my emails and discussions on various Discourse sites.</p>
<h3><a name="p-15917-on-banning-ai-contributions-prototypes-and-similar-9" href="#p-15917-on-banning-ai-contributions-prototypes-and-similar-9"></a>On banning AI contributions, prototypes and similar</h3>
<p>Firstly <strong>you must</strong> be respectful of the rules any project you contribute has, seek them out and read them prior to contributing. For example: Cloud hypervisor says <a href="https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">no AI generated code</a> to avoid licensing risks.</p>
<p>That said, there is a trend among many developers of banning AI. Some go so far as to say ‚ÄúAI not welcome here‚Äù find another project.</p>
<p>This feels extremely counterproductive and fundamentally unenforceable to me. Much of the code AI generates is indistinguishable from human code anyway. You can usually tell a prototype that is pretending to be a human PR, but a real PR a human makes with AI assistance can be indistinguishable.</p>
<p>The new LLM tooling can be used in tremendous amounts of ways including simple code reviews and simple renamings within a file, to complete change set architecture.</p>
<p>Given the enormous mess and diversity here I think the healthiest approach is to set clear expectations. If I am submitting a PR it should match my brand and be code I vouch for.</p>
<p>As engineers it is our role to <strong>properly label</strong> our changes. Is our change ready for human review or is it simply a fun exploration of the problem space?</p>
<h3><a name="p-15917-why-is-this-important-10" href="#p-15917-why-is-this-important-10"></a>Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Human code review is increasingly becoming a primary bottleneck in software engineering. We need to be respectful of people‚Äôs time and protect our own engineering brands.</p>
<p>Prototype are fun, they can teach us a lot about a problem space. But when it comes to sending contributions to a project, treat all code as code you wrote, put your stamp of ownership and approval on whatever you build and only then send a PR you vouch for.</p>

Time to panic, right?</p> <p>In this post I try to provide a bit more context. I explain how request smuggling vulnerabilities work in general, how it works in <em>this</em> case, what attackers could use it for, how the vulnerability was fixed, what you can do to protect yourself.</p> <blockquote> <p>WARNING: I am not a security professional, so do not take anything in this post as gospel or advice. I'm just a developer trying to make sense of things. üòÑ All of the details in this post are based on information that was provided or referenced in the original announcement.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="what-is-the-cve-2025-55315-vulnerability-"><a href="#what-is-the-cve-2025-55315-vulnerability-">What is the CVE-2025-55315 vulnerability?</a></h2> <p>On October 14th 2025, on a standard Microsoft "patch Tuesday", Microsoft released new versions of all their supported versions of .NET, and also published a security advisory: <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033">Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2025-55315: .NET Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability</a>. The high level summary from that announcement said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Inconsistent interpretation of http requests ('http request/response smuggling') in ASP.NET Core allows an authorized attacker to bypass a security feature over a network.</p> </blockquote> <p>The advice was "patch all of your things", but the real headline was that this vulnerability was given a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System">CVSS score</a> of 9.9 our of 10, which you know, sounds pretty bad! <a href="https://github.com/blowdart">Barry Dorrans AKA blowdart</a>, .NET security head honcho, gave <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033#issuecomment-3403054914">an explanation of the reasoning behind the score</a> in a comment on the original issue:</p> <blockquote> <p>The bug enables HTTP Request Smuggling, which on its own for ASP.NET Core would be nowhere near that high, but that's not how we rate things...</p> <p>Instead, we score based on how the bug might affect applications built on top of ASP.NET.</p> <p>Request Smuggling allows an attacker to hide an extra request inside an another, and what that hidden request can do is very application specific.</p> <p>The smuggled request could cause your application code to</p> <ul><li>Login as a different user (EOP)</li> <li>Make an internal request (SSRF)</li> <li>Bypass CSRF checks</li> <li>Perform an injection attack</li></ul> <p>But we don't know what's possible because it's dependent on how you've written your app.</p> </blockquote> <p>That <em>does</em> all sound pretty scary! üò± So you can understand the consternation that the issue has caused, especially given the hesitation to explain exactly what "how you've written your app" <em>means</em>.</p> <p>Out of curiosity, I decided to dig in further to really understand this vulnerability, how it could impact you, and what "how you've written your app" could mean.</p> <h2 id="how-does-request-smuggling-work-"><a href="#how-does-request-smuggling-work-">How does request smuggling work?</a></h2> <p>Before we get to the actual patched vulnerability in ASP.NET Core and how the vulnerability works, I think it's important to have some background about the general <em>class</em> of exploits known as <em>HTTP request smuggling</em>.</p> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_request_smuggling">HTTP request smuggling</a> is a security exploit that has been known about for a <em>long</em> time (according to Wikipedia, <a href="https://www.cgisecurity.com/lib/HTTP-Request-Smuggling.pdf">it was first documented in 2005</a>). It fundamentally arises when you have two different servers processing an HTTP request (e.g. a server and a proxy server), and where those two servers <em>differ</em> in how they handle "invalid" HTTP requests.</p> <p>In all cases of HTTP request smuggling, the exploit works by creating an invalid HTTP request (or sometimes just an <em>ambiguous</em> request), that looks a bit like two HTTP requests glued together. In summary, the exploit then works a bit like this:</p> <ul><li>The proxy server receives the ambiguous HTTP request</li> <li>The proxy server forwards the request (unmodified) to the destination server</li> <li>The server interprets the ambiguous request as <em>two</em> pipelined HTTP requests sent to the server, and processes them separately.</li></ul> <p>I think it's easiest to understand the problem with an example, so the request below shows an example from <a href="https://www.cgisecurity.com/lib/HTTP-Request-Smuggling.pdf">the original 2005 paper</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note that this is <em>not</em> an example of the request smuggling vulnerability in CVE-2025-55315, it's just a representative example of request smuggling in <em>general</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Let's imagine the attacker sends an HTTP request that looks like this:</p> <div><pre><code><span><span>POST</span> <span>/some_script.jsp</span> <span>HTTP/1.0</span></span>
<span><span>Connection</span><span>:</span> <span>Keep-Alive</span></span>
<span><span>Content-Type</span><span>:</span> <span>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</span></span>
<span><span>Content-Length</span><span>:</span> <span>9</span></span>
<span><span>Content-Length</span><span>:</span> <span>204</span></span>

this=thatPOST /vuln_page.jsp HTTP/1.0
<span><span>Content-Type</span><span>:</span> <span>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</span></span>
<span><span>Content-Length</span><span>:</span> <span>95</span></span>

param1=value1&amp;data=&lt;script&gt;alert("stealing%20your%20data:"%2bdocument.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;&amp;foobar
</code></pre></div> <p>The important feature of this request is that there are <em>two</em> <code>Content-Length</code> headers, with different values: <code>9</code> or <code>204</code>. <strong>This is the core of the exploit</strong>; the difference between <em>which</em> of the these two headers the HTTP proxy and HTTP server honour is what causes the vulnerability.</p> <p>Let's walk through how the exploit works, step-by-step:</p> <ul><li>The attacker sends the above HTTP request.</li> <li>The HTTP proxy receives the request, notes the duplicate <code>Content-Length</code> headers, and accepts the <em>second</em> header, the <code>204</code> length. That means the <em>whole</em> rest of the request is treated as the message body, and seems fine as far as the proxy is concerned.</li> <li>The HTTP proxy forwards the request on to the destination server.</li> <li>This server also notes the duplicate <code>Content-Length</code> header, but it takes the <em>first</em> of the headers, with the length of <code>9</code>.</li> <li>The server reads <code>9</code> bytes of the body (i.e. <code>this=that</code>) and <em>treats that as the whole request</em>. As far as the server is concerned, the whole (valid) request has been received, and it sees the rest of the data <em>as a whole new request</em>.</li> <li>That means that the destination server sees an entirely new HTTP request to process, <code>POST /vuln_page.jsp</code>, and treats it as a new request.</li></ul> <p>That's the core of the issue; the proxy saw one request, while the destination server saw <em>two</em>‚Äîthe second request has been "smuggled" past the proxy to the server.</p> <blockquote> <p>The request smuggling technique shown here, where you have multiple <code>Content-Length</code> headers isn't the "canonical" example you'll generally see referenced, but I used it here because it's simpler to understand in a lot of ways.</p> <p>The canonical request smuggling attack is where you send both a <code>Content-Length</code> header and a <code>Transfer-Encoding: chunked</code> header (which specifies the length of the body as part of the body itself). As before, the request smuggling exploit relies on differences in how proxy and destination servers interpret these <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#section-6.3-2.3">conflicting headers</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>So as you've seen, request smuggling enables sending a secret request to a destination server that an intermediate proxy server hasn't seen. In the next section we'll look at why that's a bad thing, and how it can be exploited.</p> <h2 id="how-can-an-attacker-exploit-request-smuggling-"><a href="#how-can-an-attacker-exploit-request-smuggling-">How can an attacker exploit request smuggling?</a></h2> <p>On the face of it, request smuggling might not <em>seem</em> like a big deal. So the server sees two requests, so what? You could always send two requests to the server <em>anyway</em>, right? Well, yes and no.</p> <p>The issue with request smuggling is really all about the <em>mismatch</em> between the proxy and destination servers. Thanks to this mismatch, and depending on what behaviours and expectations the target application has, attackers can use request smuggling to</p> <ul><li>Reflect malicious data to other users on sites that are vulnerable to cross-site scripting.</li> <li>Poison caches with bad data.</li> <li>Exfiltrate authentication credentials or other data from client requests.</li> <li>Invoke endpoints that shouldn't be publicly accessible (because the proxy would block external access to them).</li> <li>Replace/override authentication controls handled by the proxy.</li> <li>Redirect users to malicious sites on sites vulnerable to open-redirect attacks.</li> <li>And more‚Ä¶</li></ul> <p>As you can see, these are all Bad‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, so you can kind of understand why the 9.9 rating was given! üò±</p> <p>That said, it's worth mentioning that not <em>all</em> of these attacks will be fruitful against <em>all</em> applications. Some of the easiest to understand versions of these exploits are where the proxy is not just doing "dumb" forwarding of requests, but rather it's validating or enhancing the request in some way.</p> <p>For example, if you have a proxy sat in front of your server which is responsible for handling TLS termination and client-authentication and identification using certificates, then request smuggling could be used to bypass these checks and insert your <em>own</em> identification.</p> <p>As an example of <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting#bypassing-client-authentication">that attack</a>, the HTTP request below demonstrates using a <code>Content-Length</code> and <code>Transfer-Encoding</code> request smuggling attack to "hide" the request to <code>/admin</code> from the front-end proxy, and insert a malicious <code>X-SSL-CLIENT-CN</code> header, which would <em>normally</em> be added by the front-end proxy:</p> <div><pre><code><span><span>POST</span> <span>/example</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span></span>
<span><span>Host</span><span>:</span> <span>some-website.com</span></span>
<span><span>Content-Type</span><span>:</span> <span>x-www-form-urlencoded</span></span>
<span><span>Content-Length</span><span>:</span> <span>64</span></span>
<span><span>Transfer-Encoding</span><span>:</span> <span>chunked</span></span>

0

<span><span>GET</span> <span>/admin</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span></span>
<span><span>X-SSL-CLIENT-CN</span><span>:</span> <span>administrator</span></span>
<span><span>Foo</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span></span>
</code></pre></div> <p>In this example, the server assumes that the <code>X-SSL-CLIENT-CN: administrator</code> header was added by the proxy, and so the server assumes that the proxy already did all the necessary authentication and authorization. The attacker is able to perform a request as an entirely different user.</p> <p>Request smuggling is clearly a big problem whenever you have a front-end proxy that does some functionality, but even when it's essentially a dumb proxy, request smuggling can still be used to <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting#capturing-other-users-requests">steal and exfiltrate data</a> from <em>other</em> user's requests, even if the attacked site is not vulnerable to cross-site scripting or other vulnerabilities.</p> <blockquote> <p>In these attacks, simply having functionality that displays data provided by a user (even sanitised) can be sufficient to <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting#capturing-other-users-requests">steal the credentials of other users</a>. So something as simple as displaying a user name or a comment could be sufficient.</p> </blockquote> <p>This post is long enough, and there are so many different attacks, that I'm going to leave it there for looking at exploits. If you'd like to learn more about what's possible, along with simple explanations and examples of exploits, I recommend the <a href="https://portswigger.net/">PortSwigger</a> documentation on <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting">exploiting request smuggling</a>.</p> <h2 id="does-request-smuggling-only-apply-if-i-have-a-proxy-"><a href="#does-request-smuggling-only-apply-if-i-have-a-proxy-">Does request smuggling only apply if I have a proxy?</a></h2> <p>In general, whenever people talk about request smuggling, they normally talk about the case where you have multiple servers: the canonical example is a proxy server and a destination server, as I've discussed so far. But don't be fooled, these issues and vulnerabilities can apply even if you aren't strictly using a proxy.</p> <p>The <em>key</em> feature of the vulnerability is that there's an opportunity for confusion between two "systems", whether they're full "servers" or not. This obviously applies to proxy servers, but could also apply to your application if you're doing anything where you're reading/manipulating/forwarding request streams, or where there's the possibility for confusion <em>inside the same application</em>.</p> <p>For ASP.NET Core applications, if you're working with <code>HttpRequest.Body</code> or <code>HttpRequest.BodyReader</code>, or other similar methods then you <em>may</em> be vulnerable to attacks <em>even if you're not explicitly using a proxy server</em>. Even if you don't think of your application as a proxy or as using a proxy, if you're doing "proxy-like" things, then you could be vulnerable.</p> <blockquote> <p>Put in other words, if you're reading, manipulating, or forwarding request streams directly in ASP.NET Core, as opposed to just relying on the built-in model binding, then you could be at risk to request smuggling attacks. It's very hard to enumerate all the attack vectors, so you should consider any code that does so as a potential avenue of exploitation.</p> </blockquote> <p>We've now covered how request smuggling works and can be exploited in general, so it's time to look at the <em>specific</em> version of request smuggling that is targeted in the .NET CVE-2025-55315 vulnerability.</p> <h2 id="how-does-the-request-smuggling-in-cve-2025-55315-work-"><a href="#how-does-the-request-smuggling-in-cve-2025-55315-work-">How does the request smuggling in CVE-2025-55315 work?</a></h2> <p>As we've seen, HTTP request smuggling is a general technique that relies on differences between proxies and servers in how they parse HTTP requests. I've shown two specific versions of this so far: duplicate <code>Content-Length</code> headers, and <code>Content-Length</code>/<code>Transfer-Encoding</code> confusion, but these are not exhaustive. There are variations on these approaches which also lead to request smuggling.</p> <p>The request smuggling vulnerability in <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033">CVE-2025-55315</a> relies on a variation which (as far as I can tell) was first reported in June 2025 by <a href="https://w4ke.info/2025/06/18/funky-chunks.html">Jeppe Bonde Weikop on their blog</a>. This variation relies on <code>Transfer-Encoding</code> and the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#name-chunk-extensions">Chunk Extensions</a> feature.</p> <blockquote> <p>All the details and images in this section are based on the descriptions and examples in <a href="https://w4ke.info/2025/06/18/funky-chunks.html">the original post</a>. That post is excellent, so if you want even more detail and explanation than here, you should definitely read it, and then you can skip the abbreviated version I provide here.</p> </blockquote> <p>To understand the vulnerability, we'll first look at how chunked transfer encoding works and what chunk extensions are. We'll then look at how invalid line-endings can lead to differences in interpretation of a request. Finally, we'll look at how this difference in interpretation can open the way for request smuggling, and how ASP.NET Core fixed the problem.</p> <h3 id="transfer-encoding-chunked-and-chunk-extensions"><a href="#transfer-encoding-chunked-and-chunk-extensions"><code>Transfer-Encoding: chunked</code> and chunk extensions</a></h3> <p>To understand the vulnerability, we first need to understand how <code>Transfer-Encoding: chunked</code> works, and how chunk extensions complicate things.</p> <p>When you're <em>sending</em> a request, you might not always know up-front how big the request is that you're sending. Let's take a practical example of serializing a .NET object to JSON into a request body. The only way to know for sure how big the serialized data is going to be is to actually serialize it. So you <em>could</em> serialize the data to memory <em>before</em> writing the request, but if the data is very big, then that could cause issues with allocating big arrays.</p> <p>Instead, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding"><code>Transfer-Encoding: chunked</code></a> allows sending the request data in multiple "chunks". You need to know the size of each individual chunk, but not the <em>overall</em> size of the data, or how many chunks there are. This works well for serializing to a small buffer, sending that small buffer as a chunk, and then re-using the buffer to serialize the next part, until you have serialized the whole object.</p> <p>In terms of the HTTP request itself, each chunk consists of a header and a body. The header consists of a hexadecimal-formatted number of bytes, followed by a <code>\r\n</code> (<code>CRLF</code>) line ending. The chunk body is then the specified number of bytes, followed by another <code>\r\n</code>. You can have as many chunks as you need, and the request will keep being passed until you send a <code>0</code> length chunk, which indicates the end of the request.</p> <p>As an example, the following HTTP <code>POST</code> shows posting some JSON to an endpoint, but the JSON is sent as three distinct chunks:</p> <p><img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/request_smuggling_01.svg" alt="A simple HTTP request using chunked transfer encoding"></p> <ul><li>Chunk 1: The header is <code>9</code> indicating 9 bytes will be sent (followed by <code>\r\n</code>), and then the 9 bytes of the start of the JSON document in the chunk body, again followed by <code>\r\n</code>.</li> <li>Chunk 1: The header is <code>e</code> indicating 14 bytes (14 in hexadecimal is <code>e</code>) will be sent (followed by <code>\r\n</code>), and then the remaining 14 bytes of the end of the JSON document, followed by <code>\r\n</code>.</li> <li>The final chunk is an "empty" chunk, <code>0\r\n\r\n</code>, indicating the end of the request.</li></ul> <p>We're going to see shortly that line endings are very important, so the following diagram shows the same as the above HTTP request, but with the line endings included:</p> <p><img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/request_smuggling_02.svg" alt="A simple HTTP request using chunked transfer encoding with the line endings shown"></p> <p>That's "normal" chunked transfer encoding, so now we come to chunk extensions. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#name-chunk-extensions">Chunk extensions</a> are part of the HTTP 1.1 protocol which allows for adding key-value pairs of metadata to individual chunks. The following example shows the same request as before, but with a chunk extension, <code>;foo=bar</code> in the second chunk:</p> <p><img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/request_smuggling_03.svg" alt="The same HTTP request with a chunk extension in the second chunk"></p> <p>A chunk extension is indicated by a <code>;</code> after the chunk header length, followed by one or more key-value pairs in the form <code>key=value</code>. It's important to understand that chunk extensions are not part of the <em>data</em> that's seen by a request handler; chunk extensions are just metadata about the individual chunk. And tl;dr; they're completely useless üòÖ</p> <p>To the closest approximation, no-one cares about chunk extensions; client implementations don't send them, and servers just ignore them. If that's the case, how can they be the cause of such a problematic bug in .NET?</p> <p>The problem is <em>how</em> the implementation ignores them‚Ä¶</p> <h3 id="invalid-chunk-extensions-with-incorrect-line-endings"><a href="#invalid-chunk-extensions-with-incorrect-line-endings">Invalid chunk extensions with incorrect line endings</a></h3> <p>In general with HTTP, clients and server implementations often try to follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle"><em>robustness principle</em></a> of "be conservative in what you send, and lenient with what you accept". Unfortunately, it's this very leniency which can sometimes leave us in hot water. After all, it was leniency around requests containing both a <code>Content-Length</code> and <code>Transfer-Encoding</code> header that was the root cause of the original request smuggling exploit.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note that the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#section-6.3-2.3">HTTP 1.1 RFC now forbids</a> forwarding both these headers, precisely to avoid request smuggling attacks.</p> </blockquote> <p>For chunk extensions though, leniency is often <em>accidentally</em> built in to the server implementations. Given that no implementations actually <em>do</em> anything with the chunk extensions, the canonical approach to handling them when parsing a chunk header is just to <em>ignore</em> them. When a <code>;</code> is parsed, it's common to just look for the end of the line, and ignore everything in between.</p> <p>For ASP.NET Core (prior to the fix), on finding a <code>;</code> in the chunk header, <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/4cf89470a7866a963d7118bb1ba90dc35683965c/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/Internal/Http/Http1ChunkedEncodingMessageBody.cs#L348-L356">Kestrel would "parse" the extension</a>, but in practice, it would search for the carriage return <code>\r</code> and then check for the following <code>\n</code>, skipping everything in between, a little bit like this (very simplified compared to <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/4cf89470a7866a963d7118bb1ba90dc35683965c/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/Internal/Http/Http1ChunkedEncodingMessageBody.cs#L348-L356">original code</a>):</p> <div><pre><code><span>private</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>ParseExtension</span><span>(</span><span>ReadOnlySequence<span>&lt;</span><span>byte</span><span>&gt;</span></span> buffer<span>)</span>

</code></pre></div> <p>The implementation in ASP.NET Core wasn't particularly special; <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/1d45a7ef560a76318ed59dfdb178cecd58caf948/src/net/http/internal/chunked.go#L193-L199">most servers</a> simply skip over the bytes until they find a <code>\r\n</code>. The big question is exactly <em>how</em> the servers search for <code>\r\n</code>. What happens if they see a lone <code>\r</code>, or a lone <code>\n</code>? Do they treat that the same as a <code>\r\n</code>? Do they throw an error if they find an un-paired <code>\r</code> or <code>\n</code>? Or do they ignore it and keep looking for a <code>\r\n</code>?</p> <p>That ambiguity is at the heart of the CVE-2025-55315 request smuggling vulnerability. Differences in how proxy and server implementations treat standalone <code>\r</code> or <code>\n</code> in a chunk header allow for request smuggling exploits that use this ambiguity.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note that according to <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid7633">the RFC</a>, implementers must <em>not</em> treat <code>\r</code> or <code>\n</code> as "valid" line terminators for a chunk header, and neither <code>\r</code> or <code>\n</code> are allowed elsewhere in chunk headers, so correct implementations must reject requests that include these standalone line endings in chunk headers.</p> </blockquote> <p>For complete clarity, the following example is the same as the previous implementation but with an <em>invalid</em> chunk header in the chunk extension of the second chunk. Instead of ending with <code>\r\n</code>, the chunk extension ends with a single <code>\n</code>:</p> <p><img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/request_smuggling_04.svg" alt="An HTTP request with an ambiguous line ending in a chunk extension"></p> <p>That's the root cause of the request smuggling vulnerability, so in the next section we'll look at <em>how</em> this could be used to craft a malicious HTTP request.</p> <h3 id="exploiting-invalid-chunk-extensions-for-request-smuggling"><a href="#exploiting-invalid-chunk-extensions-for-request-smuggling">Exploiting invalid chunk extensions for request smuggling</a></h3> <p>Just as with other examples of request smuggling, the chunk extensions approach relies on differences in how a proxy parses a request compared to a subsequent server. This difference means the proxy sees one request, while the destination request sees two requests, and allows for <a href="#how-can-an-attacker-exploit-request-smuggling-">all the same exploits I discussed earlier</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>As discussed, these examples come from <a href="https://w4ke.info/2025/06/18/funky-chunks.html">this excellent blog post</a>, so see that post for more details, variations on the attack, and further ways to exploit the vulnerability.</p> </blockquote> <p>The following example shows a malicious HTTP request that exploits a difference in line-ending handling between a proxy and the destination server to smuggle a request to the <code>/admin</code> endpoint. We can imagine that the proxy is configured to automatically reject requests to <code>/admin</code> normally, and the server assumes that the proxy handles that for us.</p> <p><img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/request_smuggling_05.svg" alt="A request smuggling attack exploiting differences between a proxy and server implementation"></p> <p>In this example the attacker creates a malformed chunk header with a chunk extension by sending <code>2;\n</code>. The <code>;</code> ensures that both the proxy and and server treat the header as a chunk extension, but using <code>\n</code> instead of <code>\r\n</code> results in differential parsing:</p> <ul><li>The proxy only sees a single request: <ul><li>It treats the <code>\n</code> as a "valid" line-ending for the chunk header</li> <li>It then treats the <code>xx</code> as the chunk body</li> <li><code>47</code> is the next chunk header</li> <li>The next 71 bytes (<code>47</code> is hex, which is 71 in decimal) are treated as the chunk body.</li> <li>Finally there's the empty chunk block</li></ul> </li> <li>The server sees two requests: <ul><li>The server ignores the lone <code>\n</code>, and skips all the way to <code>xx\r\n</code></li> <li>It then treats the <code>47</code> as the chunk body</li> <li>It sees an ending chunk,<code>0\r\n\r\n</code> and thinks the request is over</li> <li>The remaining data is treated as a completely separate request, which contains only an empty chunk in the body.</li></ul> </li></ul> <p>This is pretty much the simplest example, but you can essentially exploit this difference in all the ways I described previously. <em>Exactly</em> what the implications are for <em>your</em> application are hard to say, but given that all sorts of security bypass, credential stealing, and injection attacks are possible, it's easy to understand why the vulnerability received a CVSS rating of 9.9.</p> <blockquote> <p>One very interesting thing I found was looking at the security advisories for the same flaw in other HTTP implementations from other languages. In the python <a href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp">aiohttp</a> and ruby <a href="https://github.com/puma/puma">puma</a> servers, for example, give <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8495-4g3g-x7pr">the vulnerability only a moderate severity</a> rating in <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c2f4-cvqm-65w2">both cases</a>. In <a href="https://github.com/netty/netty">netty</a> it's even given <a href="https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-fghv-69vj-qj49">a low severity</a>.</p> <p>As far as I can tell, these servers are essentially vulnerable in the same way as ASP.NET Core is, so it's just an interesting data point, and I think reflects how Microsoft really want to make sure this gets the visibility it deserves and that customers patch their apps!</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="how-was-the-vulnerability-fixed-"><a href="#how-was-the-vulnerability-fixed-">How was the vulnerability fixed?</a></h3> <p>As with most fixes for request-smuggling, the solution is to stop being lenient and/or ambiguous about how standalone line-endings are handled in chunk headers.</p> <p>In ASP.NET Core, <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/64037">the PR that fixes the issue</a> does so by explicitly checking for <em>any</em> line-endings, instead of just looking for <code>\r</code>. If it finds a line ending and it's <em>not</em> strictly <code>\r\n</code>, then Kestrel now throws a <code>KestrelBadHttpRequestException</code> and returns a <code>400</code> response.</p> <p><img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/request_smuggling_06.png" alt="A screenshot of the fix from the PR https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/64037"></p> <blockquote> <p>I'll mention here there <em>is</em> an <code>AppContext</code> switch for <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/33ab51daf86b690432f44749824972c1f5019e83/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/Internal/Http/Http1ChunkedEncodingMessageBody.cs#L31"><em>opting-in</em> to the dangerous/vulnerable parsing behaviour</a> after you have patched your application, but please don't use it, I can't believe there's really a good (or <em>safe</em>) reason to.üòÖ</p> </blockquote> <p>The vulnerability has been patched in ASP.NET Core, so what should you do?</p> <h2 id="what-should-you-do-"><a href="#what-should-you-do-">What should you do?</a></h2> <p>Obviously the <em>good</em> news here is that there is a fix for ASP.NET Core.

Well, then you <em>can't</em> patch‚Ä¶ <a href="https://www.herodevs.com/">HeroDevs</a> provide additional support for out-of-support versions of .NET (<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033#issuecomment-3411924593">and have confirmed they'll be patching it in .NET 6</a>), but this vulnerability is present in basically <em>all</em> versions of .NET Core as far as I can tell. I've personally tested down to .NET Core 3.0 and I can confirm that the vulnerability is there <em>and there are no patches coming for you</em>. The best thing to do is to update to a supported version of .NET.</p> <blockquote> <p>‚ö†Ô∏è If you are running ASP.NET Core using &lt;=.NET Core 3.0, .NET Core 3.1, .NET 5, .NET 6 (<a href="https://www.herodevs.com/blog-posts/critical-asp-net-vulnerability-cve-2025-55315-reported-upgrade-now">unless supported by HeroDevs</a>), or .NET 7, then you are vulnerable, and there are no patches. You should update to a supported version of .NET as soon as possible. Ironically, if you're stuck on old .NET Framework Web Forms or MVC applications <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033#issuecomment-3442910860">you are apparently <em>not</em> vulnerable</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>It's worth noting that if you are stuck on one of these old framework versions and <em>can't</em> upgrade, then probably the best way to protect yourself is to ensure that you have a proxy in front of your application which is confirmed to not be vulnerable (though obviously you are likely vulnerable to <em>other</em> exploits üòÖ).</p> <p>For example, <a href="https://azure.github.io/AppService/2025/10/20/dotnet-on-windows.html">Azure App Services (AAS) confirmed</a> that applications running in AAS are no longer vulnerable, even if you haven't updated, because the proxy that AAS uses (itself a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/bringing-kestrel-and-yarp-to-azure-app-services/">YARP based ASP.NET Core proxy</a>) has been patched. By blocking the requests at the proxy level, ambiguous requests will never make it to your application, so you are protected.</p> <p>Unfortunately, right now, it's not clear exactly where you stand if you're using a service other than AAS for hosting your applications. Even IIS hasn't been confirmed to be safe or vulnerable at this point, but I did some unofficial testing on my Windows 11 box, and as fat as I can tell, it <em>is</em> vulnerable.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note that various people <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033#issuecomment-3445099135">in the original issue</a> are attempting to test IIS by using the <code>Content-Length</code>/<code>Transfer-Encoding</code> version of request smuggling, which is not applicable here; we're interested in the chunk-extensions based version.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another interesting point is that this is vulnerability in HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 <em>only</em>; it is not a vulnerability in HTTP/2 or HTTP/3. HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 do not support chunked transfer encoding, and instead uses a different, more efficient, binary framing layer for data streaming. So another way to protect those applications which you <em>can't</em> upgrade may be to enforce that client's can <em>only</em> use HTTP/2 or HTTP/3. Be aware that's liable to break a <em>lot</em> of clients that are still using HTTP/1.1 though!</p> <blockquote> <p>You can configure the HTTP protocols allowed by Kestrel by configuring your Kestrel endpoints. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/endpoints?view=aspnetcore-9.0#configure-http-protocols">The documentation</a> shows various ways to do this.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="how-to-know-if-you-re-affected-"><a href="#how-to-know-if-you-re-affected-">How to know if you're affected?</a></h2> <p>The "simplest" way to know if you're affected is to check the version of .NET you're using to run your applications, using <code>dotnet --info</code> and verify that you're using one of the patched versions. If you are, you're safe. That's the only "supported" way to know that you're safe, and it's the one way I would recommend. As far as I can tell, there isn't currently a generalised tool to point at an application to find out if it's vulnerable, though it would likely be possible to write one.</p> <p>The folks at HeroDevs <a href="https://github.com/sirredbeard/CVE-2025-55315-repro">re-implemented the functional tests</a> from the original ASP.NET Core fix as a console application compiled against multiple versions of ASP.NET Core. They used this to confirm that unpatched versions of .NET 8-.NET 10 are vulnerable, while <em>patched</em> versions are not. They also used this to verify .NET 6 is vulnerable, and I tweaked it to confirm everything down to at least .NET Core 3.0 is vulnerable.</p> <p>The <a href="https://github.com/sirredbeard/CVE-2025-55315-repro">test in the repro</a> works by sending a chunked transfer encoding request to ASP.NET Core, with an invalid line ending in a chunk extension header. The vulnerability is identified by ASP.NET Core "hanging", waiting for more data, until it eventually times out. The "fixed" version immediately throws the <code>BadRequest</code> exception included in the fix.</p> <blockquote> <p>I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE758TvUE5c">saw some confusion</a> about this test online; the argument was "if both the fixed and broken versions throw an exception, why does it matter"? However, that's not the point of the test. The fact that Kestrel is paused waiting for more data indicates that a smuggled HTTP request <em>would</em> have been executed. You can see how this can be leveraged to exfiltrate data or attack other users both in <a href="https://w4ke.info/2025/06/18/funky-chunks.html#exploiting-live-users">the chunk extensions blog</a> or <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting">on PortSwigger's site</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>I used a similar approach to try to understand whether IIS might be vulnerable by sending the same crafted HTTP request to IIS and seeing if it hung until timing out: it did on my version of IIS (<code>10.0.26100.1882</code>):</p> <div><pre><code><span># Send an HTTP request with an invalid chunk extension, and see</span>
<span># if it times out or if it's rejected with a 400... It times out üôÅ</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"GET / HTTP/1.1<span title="\r">\r</span><span title="\n">\n</span>Host:<span title="\r">\r</span><span title="\n">\n</span>Transfer-Encoding: chunked<span title="\r">\r</span><span title="\n">\n</span><span title="\r">\r</span><span title="\n">\n</span>1;<span title="\n">\n</span>"</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>nc</span> localhost <span>80</span>
</code></pre></div> <p>So does that definitely mean IIS is vulnerable? No, don't trust me, I'm not a security researcher üòÖ But until you hear otherwise, I would play it safe and assume that IIS <em>won't</em> protect you from chunk extension request smuggling attacks. And in general, I would apply the same rules to any other proxies you are relying on in your infrastructure.</p> <p>And as a final reminder, even though request smuggling is typically described and demonstrated using a proxy in front of your server, just <em>not</em> using a proxy does <em>not</em> mean you're automatically safe. If you're reading, manipulating, or forwarding request streams directly in ASP.NET Core, as opposed to just relying on the built-in model binding, then you <em>might</em> be at risk to request smuggling attacks. It's best to play it safe, patch your apps, and wherever possible leave the complexity of manipulating requests to ASP.NET Core.</p> <p>In general, I would make sure to subscribe to <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033">the ASP.NET Core issue on GitHub</a>, as it's likely that any more announcements around the issue will also be reported there.</p> <h2 id="summary"><a href="#summary">Summary</a></h2> <p>In this post I discuss the recent ASP.NET Core vulnerability: <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033">Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2025-55315: .NET Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability</a>. This advisory warns of a request smuggling vulnerability that affects basically all versions of ASP.NET Core.</p> <p>I described how request smuggling works in general, using a simple example of request smuggling to show how ambiguity in how HTTP is parsed can lead to HTTP proxies and HTTP servers in handling the same HTTP request in different ways. This can lead to the server seeing two requests where the proxy only sees a single request.</p> <p>After walking through a request smuggling example, I discussed some of the ways attackers could exploit a request smuggling vulnerability. That includes reflecting malicious data to other users of your app, exfiltrating authentication credentials or other data from client requests, invoking endpoints that shouldn't be publicly accessible, and various other attacks.</p> <p>Next I walked through the specific request smuggling vulnerability identified in CVE-2025-55315. This uses ambiguities in the parsing of chunk extensions when sending requests that use chunked transfer encoding. Chunk extensions are generally ignored by all servers, but lenient handling can lead to differential handling between proxy and server, providing an avenue for request smuggling.</p> <p>Finally, I walked through the mitigation steps you should take: patching your applications. I described the information we currently have about vulnerable or patched proxy servers, and how old versions of ASP.NET Core are not going to be getting patches, so will remain vulnerable (shout out again <a href="https://www.herodevs.com/blog-posts/critical-asp-net-vulnerability-cve-2025-55315-reported-upgrade-now">to HeroDevs for supporting .NET 6</a>). If you're running in AAS, <a href="https://azure.github.io/AppService/2025/10/20/dotnet-on-windows.html">then you're ok</a>, but otherwise, you need to check with your proxy provider to establish whether you are vulnerable or not.</p> </section></article>  <nav><a rel="next" href="https://andrewlock.net/adding-metadata-to-fallback-endpoints-in-aspnetcore/"><span><img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/fallbackroutes_banner.png" alt="Adding metadata to fallback endpoints in ASP.NET Core"></span> <span><label>Previous</label> <span>Adding metadata to fallback endpoints in ASP.NET Core</span></span></a></nav> </section></div>]]></description>

<h2 id="why-i-built-this">Why I Built This</h2>
<p>My team needed to choose a framework for an upcoming app. The requirements were clear: it had to work well on mobile. Not ‚Äúacceptable on mobile,‚Äù but actually good. We‚Äôre building tools for real estate agents working in the field: open houses, parking lots, spotty cellular signals. When someone‚Äôs standing in front of a potential buyer trying to look professional, a slow-loading app isn‚Äôt just an annoyance. It‚Äôs a liability.</p>
<p>I started with what seemed like a reasonable comparison: Next.js (our current default when a framework is required) versus SolidStart and SvelteKit (alternatives I‚Äôd heard good things about). Three frameworks, should be straightforward. But when I built the first implementations and started measuring, something became clear: the issues I was seeing with Next.js weren‚Äôt specific to Next.js. They were fundamental to React‚Äôs architecture. I wondered whether the other dominant frameworks (Angular, Vue) might have similar mobile web performance limitations.</p>
<p>That question changed the scope. If I was going to make a real recommendation for the team, I needed to test all the major meta-frameworks and understand the full landscape of alternatives. Three frameworks became ten. What started as a practical evaluation for work turned into something bigger: a semi-comprehensive look at what‚Äôs actually possible for mobile web performance in 2025.</p>
<p>This post shares what I discovered. The measurements are real, the kanban apps are identical (same features, same database, same styling), and the differences are dramatic. Marko delivers 12.6 kB raw (6.8 kB compressed). Next.js ships 497.8 kB raw (154.5 kB compressed). That‚Äôs a 39x difference in raw size that translates to real seconds on cellular networks.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre interested in the theoretical implications of why framework diversity matters, I wrote about that in <a href="https://www.lorenstew.art/blog/react-won-by-default">React Won by Default</a>. This post focuses on the data: what I built, what I measured, and what it means for teams making similar decisions.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="key-takeaways-tldr">Key Takeaways (TL;DR)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Next-Gen Frameworks Deliver Instant Performance:</strong> Marko (39ms), SolidStart (35ms), SvelteKit (38ms), and Nuxt (38ms) all achieve essentially instant First Contentful Paint in the 35-39ms range. This is 12 to 13 times faster than Next.js at 467ms. The 4ms spread between fastest and slowest is statistically measurable but perceptually meaningless to users. All next-gen frameworks feel instant. The real performance story isn‚Äôt splitting hairs over 3ms differences, it‚Äôs the massive gap between next-gen and React/Angular.</p>
<p><strong>Bundle Size Champion: Marko</strong> delivers 88.8 kB raw (28.8 kB compressed) for the board page, 6.36 times smaller than Next.js‚Äôs 564.9 kB raw (176.3 kB compressed). This is 44% smaller than the next closest competitor (SolidStart at 41.5 kB compressed), making Marko the clear choice when bundle size is the absolute top priority.</p>
<p><strong>Resumability Pattern: Qwik City</strong> at 114.8 kB raw (58.4 kB compressed) eliminates traditional hydration via resumability, yielding instant interactivity for larger client-side apps. Different architectural approach that solves different problems.</p>
<p><strong>Nuxt Proves Established Frameworks Can Compete:</strong> At 224.9 kB raw (72.3 kB compressed) with 38ms FCP, Nuxt demonstrates that established ‚Äúbig three‚Äù frameworks can achieve next-gen performance when properly configured. Vue‚Äôs architecture allows competitive mobile web performance while maintaining a mature ecosystem. React and Angular show no path to similar results.</p>
<p><strong>Critical scaling difference</strong>: MPA frameworks (Marko, HTMX) ship minimal JavaScript per page, staying lean as you add features. SPA frameworks ship routing and framework runtime upfront, with higher baselines even using code splitting. Marko delivers around 12.6 to 88.8 kB raw regardless of total routes. SPAs maintain 85.9 to 666.5 kB raw baselines plus route chunks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The key finding?</strong> The dominant frameworks show dramatically different results. React has an unavoidable performance ceiling. TanStack Start achieves 373.6 kB raw (118.2 kB compressed) bundles using React 19, only 1.51 times better than Next.js‚Äôs 564.9 kB raw (176.3 kB compressed). Angular ships similarly heavy bundles via Analog at 666.5 kB raw (203.4 kB compressed). But Vue (via Nuxt) proved different, achieving competitive 224.9 kB raw (72.3 kB compressed) bundles with instant 38ms FCP that matches next-gen frameworks. Meanwhile, next-gen frameworks like SolidStart deliver 128.6 kB raw (41.5 kB compressed) bundles with equally instant 35ms FCP, 4.39 times smaller than Next.js and 2.91 times smaller than TanStack Start with React. The perfect controlled comparison: TanStack Start with React (373.6 kB raw) versus TanStack Start with Solid (182.6 kB raw). Same meta-framework, same patterns, but React bundles are 2x the size of Solid, isolating React‚Äôs runtime cost.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile is the web.</strong> These measurements matter because mobile web is the primary internet for billions of people. If your app is accessible via URL, people will use it on phones with cellular connections. Optimizing for desktop and hoping mobile is good enough is backwards. The web is mobile. Build for that reality.</p>
<p>Each build uses the same database, features, and UI so the comparison stays fair. The differences in raw bundle size for the board page range from 4.39 to 6.36 times smaller compared to Next.js for modern alternatives. <strong>Important: These measurements represent disciplined baseline implementations with minimal dependencies.</strong> Real production apps typically ship 5 to 10 times more JavaScript from analytics, authentication, feature flags, and third party libraries, meaning the framework differences compound significantly in practice. On mobile devices with cellular connections, this matters enormously.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before diving in, a reminder from my <a href="https://www.lorenstew.art/blog/progressive-complexity-manifesto">Progressive Complexity Manifesto</a>: The frameworks compared here represent Level 5 complexity. They are powerful tools for when you need unified client-side state, a lot of reactivity, and/or client-side navigation. But most applications thrive at lower levels. For instance, Level 3 (server-rendered HTML enhanced with HTMX and vanilla JavaScript, as demonstrated in the kanban-htmx app in this repo) can handle complex interactive applications with minimal JavaScript. Level 4 adds occasional Web Components using Lit for reusable elements. These simpler approaches often deliver even smaller bundles and much simpler codebases. This post focuses on Level 5 options for cases that demand them, while remembering simpler paths often suffice.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-mobile-web-performance-matters">Why Mobile Web Performance Matters</h2>
<p>For this evaluation, mobile performance wasn‚Äôt just a nice to have. It was the primary constraint. Our users are real estate agents working in the field: open houses with 30 people hammering the same cell tower, parking lots between showings, anywhere but a desk with WiFi. They need tools that work instantly, not ‚Äúeventually load.‚Äù</p>
<p>We‚Äôre not building a native app. We‚Äôre building for the web, which means if it has a URL, people will access it on their phones. And for our users, the app could be used on a phone just as frequently as a desktop.</p>
<p>This reality shaped the evaluation. I couldn‚Äôt just pick a framework that ‚Äúworks on mobile.‚Äù I needed something that genuinely performs well on cellular connections with mid-tier devices. The difference between a framework shipping 30 kB versus 170 kB isn‚Äôt academic. It‚Äôs the difference between an app that feels professional and one that makes our users look bad in front of clients.</p>
<p><strong>The business cost of slow performance</strong>: Research from <a href="https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/downtime-vs-slowtime/">Tammy Everts at SpeedCurve</a> reveals something surprising. While site downtime causes 9% permanent user abandonment, slow performance causes 28% permanent abandonment. That‚Äôs over 3x worse. Even more revealing: slowdowns occur 10x more frequently than outages, resulting in roughly 2x total revenue impact despite lower per-hour costs. Beyond the abandonment numbers, slow performance creates a psychological effect where users start perceiving your entire brand negatively. Content seems ‚Äúboring,‚Äù design looks ‚Äútacky,‚Äù even when those elements haven‚Äôt changed. Slowness poisons everything. These aren‚Äôt abstract metrics. They‚Äôre measurable business costs that compound with every framework kilobyte you ship to mobile users.</p>
<p><strong>The real-world cost:</strong> A 113 kB difference at 3G speeds (750 kbps) means 1.2 seconds for download plus 500ms to 1s for parse/execution on mobile CPUs. Total: 1.5 to 2 seconds slower between frameworks. On 4G the gap shrinks but remains noticeable. On spotty connections (like an open house with 30 people hammering the same cell tower) it becomes painful.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs cached!‚Äù</strong> This objection misses reality. Cache busting is standard. Every deployment means users download again. First impressions matter. So do second, third, and tenth impressions. Your users remember waiting.</p>
<p>This is why I expanded the evaluation beyond the initial three frameworks. I needed to understand what‚Äôs actually possible. When someone pulls up the app in a parking lot between showings, every second counts. Building for mobile performance first means desktop on WiFi is excellent by default. The reverse isn‚Äôt true. Optimize for desktop and mobile users suffer.</p>
<p>I discovered the difference between frameworks reflects fundamentally different engineering priorities. Some frameworks prioritize runtime flexibility, shipping extensive abstractions to support wide use cases. Others prioritize runtime size and mobile performance from the ground up. The bundle sizes I measured for the board page varied by up to 7x (from 28.8 kB compressed to 203.4 kB compressed), differences that matter enormously on cellular networks.</p>
<h2 id="the-experiment-setup">The Experiment Setup</h2>
<p>I built a Kanban board application ten times, once in each of these frameworks: <a href="https://nextjs.org/"><strong>Next.js 16</strong></a> (React 19 with built-in compiler) representing React‚Äôs Virtual DOM approach with automatic optimization, <a href="https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/overview"><strong>TanStack Start</strong></a> (also React 19) for a leaner React meta-framework without App Router overhead, <a href="https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/solid/overview"><strong>TanStack Start + Solid</strong></a> (SolidJS 1.9) using the same meta-framework with fine-grained reactivity, <a href="https://nuxt.com/"><strong>Nuxt 4</strong></a> (Vue 3) for Vue‚Äôs reactive refs with SSR-first developer experience, <a href="https://analogjs.org/"><strong>Analog</strong></a> (Angular 20) using Angular‚Äôs modern signals API with meta-framework tooling, <a href="https://markojs.com/docs/marko-run/getting-started"><strong>Marko</strong></a> (@marko/run) for streaming SSR with fine-grained reactivity, <a href="https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-start/"><strong>SolidStart</strong></a> (SolidJS 1.9) for native Solid integration with fine-grained reactivity through signals, <a href="https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction"><strong>SvelteKit</strong></a> (Svelte 5) for fine-grained reactivity with runes, <a href="https://qwik.dev/docs/qwikcity/"><strong>Qwik City</strong></a> for resumability instead of hydration, and <strong><a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> + <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a></strong> for a traditional MPA approach.</p>
<p>Each implementation includes the exact same features: board creation and listing pages, four fixed lists per board (Todo, In Progress, QA, Done), full CRUD operations for cards, drag-and-drop card reordering within lists and movement between lists, assignee assignment from a static user list, tag management, comments on cards with authorship tracking, completion status toggles, optimistic UI updates for drag-and-drop and chart changes (HTMX lacks this though), and server-side form validation using <a href="https://valibot.dev/">Valibot</a>.</p>
<p>All ten apps share the same foundation. The database is SQLite with <a href="https://orm.drizzle.team/">Drizzle ORM</a> using an identical schema across all implementations. Styling comes from <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> plus <a href="https://daisyui.com/">DaisyUI</a> to keep the UI consistent. Each framework implementation contains roughly 17 components. Most importantly, every app performs real database queries against relational data (boards ‚Üí lists ‚Üí cards ‚Üí tags/comments/users) rather than working with hardcoded arrays.</p>
<p>You can check out the code <a href="https://github.com/lorenseanstewart/kanban-comparison">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A critical choice about dependencies</strong>: These apps intentionally minimize dependencies compared to what many developers typically reach for. For mobile web applications, every dependency represents a choice to ship additional kilobytes to users. I used necessary UI libraries like drag-and-drop packages (which vary by ecosystem), but deliberately avoided data fetching libraries, state management helpers, and other utilities that frameworks already handle natively. Each ecosystem has popular packages that add convenience but increase bundle size (React developers often reach for tanstack-query for data fetching, state management libraries, or form helpers). To illustrate the trade-off: tanstack-query alone weighs approximately 13 kB gzipped. That single dependency is already larger than Marko‚Äôs entire homepage bundle at 6.8 kB. By avoiding these ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù dependencies and using each framework‚Äôs built-in capabilities instead, the bundle differences you‚Äôll see reflect framework architectural choices, not different amounts of functionality or third-party helpers.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement Methodology</strong>: All bundle sizes in this comparison represent median values from 10 measurement runs with browser cache cleared between each run to ensure cold-load performance measurements. Server warmup requests and IQR outlier removal ensure robust statistics. I report both raw (uncompressed) JavaScript sizes and compressed transfer sizes. The raw size reflects actual code volume generated by each framework and is more consistent for comparison since it doesn‚Äôt vary by server compression settings. The compressed size shows what users actually download over the network. See the complete <a href="https://github.com/lorenseanstewart/kanban-comparison/blob/main/METHODOLOGY.md">measurement methodology</a> for details on statistical approach, test conditions, and limitations.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs how the tech stacks compare:</p>

<p>This isn‚Äôt a todo list with hardcoded arrays. It‚Äôs a real app with database persistence, complex state management, and the kind of interactions you‚Äôd actually build for a real product.</p>
<h3 id="framework-architectures-at-a-glance">Framework Architectures at a Glance</h3>
<p>To avoid repetition throughout this post, here are the key architectural approaches for each framework tested:</p>
<p><strong>React-based (Next.js, TanStack Start + React):</strong> Use Virtual DOM reconciliation where components re-render and React diffs changes before updating the DOM. React‚Äôs compiler automatically optimizes components through memoization using a Control Flow Graph-based High-Level Intermediate Representation, reducing manual optimization needs but not bundle size. Next.js employs React Server Components (RSC) which serialize component trees into a special RSC Payload format, adding meta-framework overhead. TanStack Start uses traditional SSR without RSC complexity. Both ship React‚Äôs runtime including Virtual DOM reconciler, synthetic event system, and platform abstractions, creating unavoidable baseline costs for mobile users.</p>
<p><strong>Solid-based (SolidStart, TanStack Start + Solid):</strong> Fine-grained reactivity via signals with read/write segregation where getters are separate from setters. JSX syntax similar to React, but signals automatically track dependencies, eliminating manual dependency arrays and rules of hooks. Components run once during initial render; subsequent updates happen directly at the reactive primitive level without re-executing component functions, minimizing CPU overhead on mobile devices. TanStack Start provides more feature-rich routing which causes slightly larger bundles compared to SolidStart‚Äôs leaner integration.</p>
<p><strong>SvelteKit:</strong> Compile-time optimization that transforms components into imperative DOM updates, with minimal runtime overhead since the compiler does most work at build time. Runes ($state, $derived, $effect) powered by signals enable fine-grained reactivity, with universal reactive primitives that work in .js/.ts files beyond just .svelte components. The compiler converts developer-written code into lean, optimized production code. This approach generates JavaScript with smaller bundles through aggressive tree-shaking, helping mobile performance on both network transfer and parse time.</p>
<p><strong>Nuxt (Vue):</strong> Reactive refs with <code>.value</code> access for reactivity tracking. Uses aggressive optimization including compile cache for faster cold starts and reactive keys for intelligent data fetching. In Vue 3 the reactivity system has been refactored for improved performance and memory efficiency, critical for mobile devices. Vapor Mode (experimental, not used here) offers a compile-first approach that bypasses Virtual DOM entirely, compiling templates directly to native DOM operations with significantly smaller runtime overhead. Despite being a ‚Äúbig three‚Äù framework, Nuxt achieves competitive bundle sizes and exceptional runtime performance, with support for mixed component trees combining different rendering strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Analog (Angular):</strong> Modern signals API provides fine-grained reactivity through primitives like signal, effect, linkedSignal, queries, and inputs. Zoneless mode enables removing zone.js from bundles entirely, eliminating its synchronization overhead which improves mobile CPU efficiency. Uses dependency injection patterns and ships with RxJS for enterprise reactive patterns, creating heavier bundles despite signals-based reactivity. Angular remains a ‚Äúbatteries-included‚Äù framework where common functionality is built-in rather than requiring third-party libraries. Incremental hydration reduces time-to-interactive by hydrating components progressively rather than all at once.</p>
<p><strong>Marko:</strong> Streaming SSR with fine-grained reactivity powered by compiler analysis. The compiler analyzes the reactivity graph at build time and compiles away components themselves, shipping only the minimal code needed for events and effects, achieving zero component overhead at runtime. Statically analyzes which components are stateful versus server-only, breaking pages into top-level stateful components and selectively serializing only needed data. HTML-first syntax with automatic dependency tracking eliminates boilerplate. Supports streaming asynchronous SSR with selective hydration where only interactive parts ship JavaScript to the client, critical for minimizing mobile bundle size.</p>
<p><strong>Qwik City:</strong> Resumability architecture that serializes application state and component boundaries directly into HTML during server rendering, allowing the client to ‚Äúresume‚Äù execution without traditional hydration that requires re-executing components to attach event listeners. Employs fine-grained lazy loading down to the component level, deferring JavaScript downloads until actual user interaction occurs. Event handlers, component logic, and complex interactions are delivered lazily on-demand, eliminating bulk initial JavaScript execution that burdens mobile CPUs. Optimized for edge platforms with distributed deployment, delivering sub-second load times on mobile networks. Best suited for complex client-heavy applications requiring instant interactivity.</p>
<p><strong>Astro + HTMX:</strong> Multi-page architecture (MPA) where Astro serves as a simple HTML renderer with no client-side JavaScript framework. HTMX handles all interactivity through declarative HTML attributes that trigger server requests and swap HTML fragments into the page. Instead of client-side state management, interactions send requests to the server which returns HTML snippets that HTMX injects into the DOM. This approach ships minimal JavaScript (just the HTMX library) and keeps pages lean as routes increase. Best suited for applications where server round trips are acceptable and client-side reactivity isn‚Äôt critical. Trades rich client-side state management for extreme simplicity and tiny bundles, optimal for form-driven or content-heavy applications.</p>
<p><strong>TanStack Start:</strong> Meta-framework with a client-first architecture philosophy (versus server-first approaches like Next.js RSC), maintaining powerful server capabilities while prioritizing client-side routing and state management. Router-centric design where the majority of framework functionality comes from TanStack Router, which is framework-agnostic and supports React and Solid. Provides isomorphic loaders that work on both server and client, streaming SSR for progressive rendering, and server functions for type-safe RPC. React version ships traditional hydration with React‚Äôs baseline costs, while Solid version achieves roughly half the bundle size using identical routing infrastructure, demonstrating how UI library choice impacts mobile performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fairness Check</strong>: Pinned versions, identical data volume on Board page, normalized CSS/icon handling (treeshake/purge). All measurements use Chrome Lighthouse with mobile emulation (Pixel 5, 4G throttling, 1x CPU). The measurement script uses 1x CPU to isolate bundle size impact from CPU performance variance. Cache is cleared between each measurement run to simulate first-visit experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-i-expanded-from-three-to-ten-frameworks">Why I Expanded from Three to Ten Frameworks</h2>
<p>When I started this evaluation, I expected to compare Next.js, SolidStart, and SvelteKit, then make a recommendation. But building those first three implementations revealed something I hadn‚Äôt anticipated: the performance issues I saw in Next.js weren‚Äôt just a React problem. They were likely systemic across the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù dominant framework ecosystems (React, Angular, Vue).</p>
<p>React (via Next.js) ships 154.5 to 176.3 kB compressed (486.1 to 564.9 kB raw) with poor runtime performance at 467ms FCP. Angular (via Analog) ships 125.4 to 203.4 kB compressed (430.3 to 666.5 kB raw). Both suffer from heavy baseline bundles that create performance costs for mobile users. Vue (via Nuxt) tells a dramatically different story. Nuxt ships competitive bundle sizes at 72.3 kB compressed (224.9 kB raw) AND achieves exceptional 38ms FCP, making it faster than all React and Angular options and competitive with next-gen frameworks like SvelteKit (38ms, tied) and Marko (39ms). This puts Nuxt in a unique position: it‚Äôs the only ‚Äúbig three‚Äù meta-framework that competes on mobile web performance. React requires architectural changes to achieve similar results. Angular has no clear path forward. Nuxt proved that with proper optimization, even established frameworks can deliver next-gen performance.</p>
<p><strong>React‚Äôs explicit strategy:</strong> React Native for mobile. In practice, React‚Äôs web runtime trades bundle size for other goals. Many teams pursuing top-tier mobile performance choose React Native. The architectural choices that make React heavy on the web are deliberate. They solve real problems for desktop and app development. But for mobile web, React‚Äôs position is essentially: use React Native instead.</p>
<p>This is a strategic business decision, not a technical oversight. Facebook (Meta) doesn‚Äôt build heavy React web apps on mobile. They invest heavily in React Native and native apps. When you use their mobile app, you‚Äôre not running a web browser rendering a React SPA. You‚Äôre running native code. React Native is their solution for mobile performance. The React web framework can be expensive because the assumption is that if you care about mobile, you should use a different tool.</p>
<p>The problem with this strategy is that it abandons the open web. React Native requires building two separate applications. Your company needs React engineers for the web, different engineers or different skill sets for native mobile development, and App Store difficulties on top.</p>
<p><strong>This isn‚Äôt just an inconvenience. It‚Äôs technofeudalism.</strong> React Native solves the mobile performance problem, but it does so by pushing developers out of the open web and into app store platforms where Apple and Google extract up to 30% of transactions, control distribution, and can revoke access at will. React‚Äôs mobile strategy inherently drives teams toward platform capture. The web offers an alternative: no gatekeepers, no platform fees, direct distribution. (I explore this dynamic in depth in ‚ÄúThe Web is the Last Commons‚Äù section below, building on economist Yanis Varoufakis‚Äôs analysis of how app stores operate as digital fiefdoms rather than competitive markets.)</p>
<p>Other frameworks make a different bet: the web should work well on mobile without requiring a parallel native technology. The teams behind Marko, Solid, Svelte, Qwik, and Vue have done phenomenal engineering work rethinking these fundamentals from first principles. They‚Äôve built innovative solutions that optimize for the web as a first-class platform for mobile. They‚Äôre all saying: you shouldn‚Äôt need a completely different technology stack just to reach people with phones. The web should be competitive on its own.</p>
<p>React‚Äôs choice is coherent within their ecosystem strategy. It makes sense given their investment in React Native. But it‚Äôs not neutral. It‚Äôs a choice that deprioritizes mobile web performance in favor of extensive runtime abstractions. For teams building mobile first web applications, it‚Äôs a choice that works against you.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why I expanded the evaluation to ten frameworks. If I was going to make an honest recommendation for the team, I needed to understand what‚Äôs actually possible. React‚Äôs heavy bundle sizes aren‚Äôt bugs or poor engineering. They‚Äôre the predictable cost of React‚Äôs runtime architectural overhead. Angular has similar bundle size issues. Vue showed that the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù can compete on mobile web performance when properly configured. For teams building mobile first web applications without the resources for React Native, React and Angular create unavoidable performance limitations, but Nuxt offers a viable path forward.</p>
<p>The measurements that follow show exactly what that tradeoff looks like in practice. They also show what happens when frameworks prioritize mobile web performance from the start. Marko at 6.8 kB compressed. Solid at 30.6 kB compressed. Svelte at 47.8 kB compressed. These aren‚Äôt just smaller numbers. They‚Äôre fundamentally different architectural approaches that treat the web as a first class platform for mobile.</p>

<p>Production builds measured showing raw JavaScript size (with compressed/gzipped transfer size in parentheses). Raw size reflects actual code volume and is more consistent for comparison. Compressed size shows what users download over the network.</p>
<p>Framework versions tested: Next.js 16.0.0-beta.0 (React 19.2.0), TanStack Start 1.133.8 (React 19.2.0), Nuxt 4.1.2 (Vue 3.5.22), Analog (Angular core 20.3.3), Marko 6.0.85 with @marko/run 0.8.1, SolidStart (@solidjs/start 1.2.0, solid-js 1.9.9), SvelteKit 2.43.6 (Svelte 5), Qwik City 1.16.1 (Qwik 1.16.1), Astro 5.14.5 + HTMX.</p>
<p><strong>These are minimal baseline implementations.</strong> Typical production apps include authentication, analytics, feature flags, form libraries, and other dependencies that multiply these numbers significantly. The framework overhead shown here compounds with every additional dependency.</p>

This field data complements the controlled measurements in this post. Important caveat: CrUX data reflects how these frameworks are used in production by average developers, not optimal implementations. If a framework shows poorly in CrUX but well in these tests, it demonstrates what‚Äôs possible with proper configuration, performance tuning, and dependency discipline. The gap between field data and optimized implementations reveals opportunity for improvement in real-world usage patterns.</p>
<p>The difference between Marko‚Äôs 88.8 kB raw (28.8 kB compressed) and Next.js‚Äôs 564.9 kB raw (176.3 kB compressed) translates to roughly 1.5 seconds on cellular. These seconds are the baseline. Time waiting to load increases with every feature and every dependency added. Those aren‚Äôt just abstract kilobytes. That‚Äôs their time, their patience, and ultimately their impression of your product.</p>
<p><strong>Critical scaling consideration</strong>: These bundle sizes represent a mid-complexity app with multiple routes. MPA frameworks like Marko ship minimal JavaScript per page (6.8 to 28.8 kB compressed per route), staying lean as you add features. SPA frameworks ship routing and framework runtime upfront. Even with code splitting, SPAs maintain higher baselines: Solid/Svelte start at 30.6 to 54.1 kB compressed then add route chunks, while React/Vue/Angular start at 72.3 to 203.4 kB compressed. The architectural model creates different scaling characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>Important context on HTMX</strong>: The Astro + HTMX implementation achieves excellent bundle sizes with the simplest codebase, but sacrifices client-side reactivity for server-driven interactions. HTMX excels for simpler, form-driven applications where most interactions trigger server requests. However, as your app‚Äôs need for rich client-side state management grows, HTMX becomes less practical. For reactive applications, Marko (6.8 to 28.8 kB compressed), Solid (30.6 to 41.5 kB compressed), and Svelte (47.8 to 54.1 kB compressed) maintain small bundles while delivering rich reactivity.</p>
<h3 id="reacts-ceiling-in-practice-tanstack-vs-next">React‚Äôs Ceiling in Practice (TanStack vs Next)</h3>
<p><strong>TanStack Start achieves 100.7 to 118.2 kB compressed bundles (316.8 to 373.6 kB raw) while Next.js ships 154.5 to 176.3 kB compressed (497.8 to 564.9 kB raw)</strong> in this measurement. Both use React 19. That‚Äôs only a 33 to 35% improvement, primarily reflecting App Router + RSC and related runtime.</p>
<p>The answer reveals that <strong>React‚Äôs runtime architecture is the primary cost</strong>, not just Next.js‚Äôs meta-framework choices.</p>
<p><strong>What‚Äôs the difference?</strong> Next.js ships the full React Server Components runtime plus serialization layers, component boundary management, caching infrastructure, App Router with all its routing features, progressive enhancement for Server Actions, image optimization, and middleware. TanStack Start strips most of that out: traditional SSR without RSC, leaner routing, and simple RPC-style server functions.</p>
<p>Both use server-side rendering, but Next.js‚Äôs RSC model adds substantial overhead. Server Components render on the server only, Client Components get marked with <code>"use client"</code>, the server serializes everything to a special format, and the client needs runtime code to deserialize and coordinate those boundaries. TanStack Start uses the simpler traditional SSR approach: render on server, ship HTML, hydrate everything on the client. No serialization, no boundary coordination.</p>
<p>In this measurement, Next.js‚Äôs App Router + RSC adds roughly 53 to 58 kB compressed. The remaining 100.7 to 118.2 kB compressed (316.8 to 373.6 kB raw) is React‚Äôs core runtime cost: reconciliation, event system, and hydration baseline.</p>
<p>Compare that to alternatives. <strong>SolidStart</strong> delivers 30.6 to 41.5 kB compressed (85.9 to 128.6 kB raw) using JSX, <strong>2.91x smaller than TanStack Start</strong> with React. <strong>SvelteKit</strong> achieves 47.8 to 54.1 kB compressed (103.4 to 125.2 kB raw), which is 1.97x to 2.47x smaller than TanStack Start. <strong>Qwik</strong> delivers 43.6 to 58.4 kB compressed (88.5 to 114.8 kB raw), which is 1.72x to 2.31x smaller.</p>
<p>For React teams, the path forward isn‚Äôt straightforward. TanStack Start proves you can remove Next.js‚Äôs overhead, but you‚Äôre still carrying React‚Äôs 100.7 to 118.2 kB compressed (316.8 to 373.6 kB raw) baseline. SolidStart offers similar JSX syntax with 2.91x smaller bundles. And if you like TanStack Start‚Äôs approach, you can use it with Solid for the same routing patterns with dramatically smaller bundles.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the bottom line: <strong>React‚Äôs architecture (not just the Virtual DOM, but also synthetic events, platform patching, and sheer feature complexity) creates unavoidable performance costs that no meta-framework optimization can eliminate.</strong> To be fair, Virtual DOM implementations can be small (see Preact at 4 kB). React‚Äôs size reflects deliberate choices to circumvent platform constraints and provide extensive features. TanStack Start proves this: removing App Router overhead yields only a 33 to 35% improvement. To escape this ceiling and achieve 3 to 4 times smaller bundles, you need a fundamentally different architectural approach. Frameworks that lean into the platform instead of circumventing it can deliver dramatic size reductions. The React team chose to accept these costs to solve other problems (Server Components, unified patterns). That‚Äôs a legitimate choice. But it‚Äôs not negotiable within React.</p>
<h3 id="tanstack-start-react-vs-solid">TanStack Start: React vs Solid</h3>
<p>Here‚Äôs where it gets interesting. TanStack Start is a new meta-framework that currently supports both React and Solid. Using the same meta-framework with two different UI libraries gives us the perfect controlled comparison.</p>
<p><strong>TanStack Start with React:</strong> Ships 373.6 kB raw (118.2 kB compressed) compared to Next.js‚Äôs 564.9 kB raw (176.3 kB compressed). That‚Äôs 34% smaller by raw size. If you‚Äôre stuck maintaining an existing Next.js codebase, TanStack Start offers a legitimate escape path from App Router complexity while staying in React. But that‚Äôs still 373.6 kB raw (118.2 kB compressed) of React‚Äôs core runtime.</p>
<p><strong>TanStack Start with Solid:</strong> Delivers 182.6 kB raw (60.4 kB compressed). That‚Äôs 30% larger than SolidStart‚Äôs 128.6 kB raw (41.5 kB compressed), but still dramatically better than any React option. The size difference is largely due to TanStack Router having more features than SolidStart‚Äôs Router. This buys you additional routing capabilities and framework flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>The controlled comparison that matters:</strong> React at 373.6 kB raw (118.2 kB compressed) versus Solid at 182.6 kB raw (60.4 kB compressed) using identical TanStack Start infrastructure. Same routing, same SSR approach, same patterns. React bundles are 2x the size of Solid. This isolates React‚Äôs runtime cost versus Solid‚Äôs architecture. No meta-framework differences, no excuses.</p>
<p>All four implementations achieve perfect 100 Lighthouse scores. Bundle size differences are real, but modern devices handle them without impacting perceived performance in this test.</p>
<p><strong>For greenfield projects?</strong> Don‚Äôt choose React. TanStack Start with Solid gives you 182.6 kB raw (60.4 kB compressed) bundles, but native SolidStart delivers 128.6 kB raw (41.5 kB compressed) with tighter integration. If you want the absolute smallest with this architecture, go SolidStart. If you like TanStack Start‚Äôs patterns and might want framework flexibility later, TanStack Start with Solid is reasonable. But starting a new project with React (whether Next.js or TanStack Start) means voluntarily accepting 2x to 3x larger bundles for no performance gain.</p>
<h2 id="the-verdict-what-im-recommending">The Verdict: What I‚Äôm Recommending</h2>
<p>After building ten implementations (with help, of course; see the acknowledgements below) and measuring everything, the data gives clear direction. For our mobile first requirements, here‚Äôs what I found:</p>
<p><strong>The next-gen frameworks all achieve essentially instant performance.</strong> The 35-39ms FCP range feels perceptually identical to users, and it‚Äôs 12 to 13 times faster than Next.js at 467ms. Since all next-gen frameworks feel equally fast, choose based on bundle size priorities and developer experience rather than microscopic FCP differences.</p>
<p>That said, context matters. Not every project can or should switch frameworks.</p>
<p><strong>When Next.js still makes sense:</strong> For large existing React codebases, migration costs may outweigh performance benefits. If you‚Äôre stuck with React and can‚Äôt migrate, consider TanStack Start over Next.js for a 21-31% bundle reduction without App Router complexity. That‚Äôs a practical business decision. But for greenfield projects? There‚Äôs no legacy to maintain, no migration costs to weigh. You‚Äôre choosing to build on a foundation that costs your users 2x to 3x more JavaScript on every visit. You‚Äôre voluntarily accepting worse performance when better options cost nothing extra. That‚Äôs not a neutral technical choice. ‚ÄúWe only know React‚Äù isn‚Äôt a technical constraint, it‚Äôs a learning investment decision. And ‚Äúorganizational politics‚Äù is real, but it‚Äôs not a technical justification. It‚Äôs an admission that better options exist but can‚Äôt be chosen.</p>
<p><strong>Reality check on common objections:</strong></p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúBut hiring!‚Äù</strong> Competent developers learn frameworks. That‚Äôs the job. These alternatives are actually easier to learn than React: no rules of hooks, no dependency arrays, no manual memoization dance. The real difficulty isn‚Äôt learning curve, it‚Äôs creating a engineering culture that acknowledges constraints and makes intentional decisions with these constraints in mind.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúBut ecosystem!‚Äù</strong> React‚Äôs ecosystem is both advantage and liability. Large libraries ship code for scenarios you‚Äôll never encounter. That date picker with every locale? You need 3 features, you‚Äôre shipping 300. For mobile-first projects where every kilobyte matters, this becomes a problem. Modern AI tools make building exactly what you need feasible: generate the function instead of importing 50kB for 3 features. Smaller bundles, code you understand.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs risky!‚Äù</strong> Shipping 3x larger bundles to mobile users on cellular is the actual risk. Slow loads damage your brand and cost conversions. The ‚Äúsafe choice‚Äù has measurable costs.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúBut my users are desktop-only!‚Äù</strong> Let‚Äôs be honest: ‚Äúdesktop-only‚Äù is usually an excuse to skip performance discipline entirely. And it‚Äôs rarely true for long. Six months later someone asks ‚Äúcan I check this on my phone?‚Äù and suddenly you‚Äôre stuck. Better to build it right from the start. Desktop users still benefit from faster parsing and execution. Even on WiFi, 30.6 kB compressed loads noticeably faster than 176.3 kB compressed. More importantly, why would you voluntarily accept 3x worse performance when the better option costs nothing extra? Performance is a feature regardless of screen size. Building with constraints makes you a better engineer. ‚ÄúDesktop-only‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúno discipline.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>Why you should seriously consider the alternatives</strong>: The mental models are often simpler (see Framework Architectures section). Alternatives like Solid, Svelte, and Marko streamline patterns with automatic reactivity. Performance comes by default with 2x to 6x smaller bundles requiring no optimization work. Mobile web matters with real users on phones, cellular connections, and mid-tier devices. You‚Äôll write less code, ship less JavaScript, and debug fewer framework quirks. Most importantly, greenfield projects deserve choices made on merit rather than defaults.</p>
<p><strong>These alternatives are especially compelling</strong> for mobile-first applications where bundle size directly impacts user experience. They matter for the growing demographic of people who prefer phones over computers. Mobile professionals like real estate agents, field service workers, healthcare staff, delivery drivers, and sales reps benefit most. Teams building internal tools or MVPs without enterprise politics constraining decisions can move faster. Developers who value technical excellence over popularity contests will appreciate the engineering quality. Importantly, teams save significant money by maintaining a single high-performance web codebase instead of splitting resources between separate web and native applications. This often means smaller teams, lower overhead, and faster iteration cycles compared to organizations maintaining web apps and native mobile apps.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing among the alternatives</strong> (organized by primary use case):</p>
<p><strong>Smallest Bundles: Choose Marko</strong> for the absolute best bundle sizes (6.8 to 28.8 kB compressed). Marko delivers 44% smaller bundles than the next closest competitor, making it the clear winner when bundle size is your top priority. The MPA architecture ships minimal JavaScript per page, staying lean as you add routes. The developer experience is excellent once you embrace its streaming model. Note: Marko 6 is currently in beta (tagged as <code>next</code> on npm) and expected to leave beta by end of year, with no expected API changes but ongoing bug fixes and optimizations.</p>
<p><strong>JSX Familiarity: Choose SolidStart</strong> if you want the easiest migration path from React. At 128.6 kB raw (41.5 kB compressed), SolidStart uses JSX syntax with automatic dependency tracking that eliminates manual memoization. This delivers 4.39x smaller bundles than Next.js while feeling immediately familiar to React developers. The mental model is actually simpler than React because signals are more straightforward than hooks.</p>
<p><strong>Best All-Around Developer Experience: Choose SvelteKit</strong> for approachable syntax and excellent defaults. At 125.2 kB raw (54.1 kB compressed), SvelteKit delivers 4.51x smaller bundles than Next.js with progressive enhancement by default and minimal framework overhead. The compiler-based approach means less runtime code and cleaner component logic. Best for developers from any background seeking readable code with few framework quirks.</p>
<p><strong>Resumability Pattern: Choose Qwik City</strong> if you have a larger application that demands immediate interactivity on load with significant client-side functionality. At 88.5 to 114.8 kB raw (43.6 to 58.4 kB compressed), Qwik uses resumability instead of hydration, yielding instant time-to-interactive. Different architectural approach that solves different scaling problems.</p>
<p><strong>Established Ecosystem: Choose Nuxt</strong> if you want Vue‚Äôs mature plugin ecosystem with competitive mobile web performance. At 224.9 kB raw (72.3 kB compressed), Nuxt proves that established ‚Äúbig three‚Äù frameworks can achieve next-gen performance when properly configured. Best for teams already familiar with Vue, projects that benefit from extensive community plugins, or teams that value the safety of a well-established framework. Nuxt bridges the gap between the familiar and the performant.</p>
<p><strong>Important scaling consideration:</strong> Marko‚Äôs MPA architecture ships minimal JavaScript per page (stays lean as you add routes), while SPAs like SvelteKit and SolidStart ship routing and framework runtime upfront then add route chunks. Both use code splitting, but the architectural models create different performance characteristics at scale.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As discussed in my <a href="https://www.lorenstew.art/blog/progressive-complexity-manifesto">Progressive Complexity Manifesto</a>, these Level 5 frameworks are only necessary when you need unified client-side state and complex reactivity. Most apps can thrive at lower levels with simpler tools like HTMX and vanilla JS/TS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When developers have real alternatives, everyone wins. React wouldn‚Äôt be adding a compiler if SolidStart and Svelte weren‚Äôt proving that automatic optimization matters. The entire ecosystem improves when we stop accepting ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù as the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>My recommendation for the team:</strong> After building all these implementations, <strong>Marko, SolidStart, and SvelteKit are all excellent choices</strong> that would serve our mobile first requirements well. All three feel perceptually instant to users. The real question is priorities: absolute smallest bundles (Marko), easiest React migration (SolidStart), or best all-around developer experience (SvelteKit). If the team has Vue experience, Nuxt is also compelling with its mature ecosystem and competitive performance.</p>
<p>For personal projects outside of work, I‚Äôll be reaching for SvelteKit and increasingly Marko. Their developer experience just feels right, the code flows naturally, and they make building things fun.</p>

<p><strong>Key Metrics:</strong></p>
<p>FCP (First Contentful Paint) indicates when the first content appears on screen. LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) shows when the main content becomes visible. TBT (Total Blocking Time) measures how long the main thread remains blocked and unavailable for user interactions. CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) evaluates visual stability, where 0 represents perfect stability with no unexpected layout shifts.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement Conditions</strong>: These scores represent mobile device emulation using Pixel 5 profile with 4G network throttling (10 Mbps download, 40ms round-trip time). I use 1x CPU (no throttling) to isolate bundle size and network impact from CPU performance, which allows fair comparison across frameworks with different runtime characteristics. Each measurement was run 10 times with cache cleared between runs to capture cold-load (first-visit) performance. Server warmup requests and IQR outlier removal ensure robust statistics. Standard deviations vary based on framework characteristics.</p>
<p>But here‚Äôs what these metrics hide. All frameworks achieve perfect or near perfect scores (100), but the paint times tell the real story about architectural differences. SolidStart achieves the fastest board page load at 35ms FCP. Nuxt and SvelteKit tie for second at 38ms FCP, with Marko close behind at 39ms. TanStack Start with Solid and TanStack Start with React follow at 40ms and 43ms respectively, showing excellent optimization. <strong>The top eight frameworks (SolidStart, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Marko, TanStack variants, Analog, Astro, Qwik) all render in under 60ms, achieving near-instant perceived performance.</strong> Only Next.js lags dramatically behind at 467ms FCP, representing a 13.3x performance gap compared to SolidStart for identical functionality.</p>
<p>Those paint time differences matter in the real world. SolidStart‚Äôs 35ms FCP feels instant, while Next.js‚Äôs 467ms FCP is noticeably slower. The framework choice directly impacts whether your app feels like a premium tool or a liability.</p>
<h3 id="where-the-difference-shows">Where the Difference Shows</h3>
<p>All frameworks feel instant in optimal conditions. The twist is this. Smaller bundles (Marko, Solid, Svelte, Qwik) win dramatically on slow networks and mid-tier devices.</p>
<p>On desktop with WiFi, all these frameworks are fast. On cellular with a mid-tier phone, 3.54 to 39.2x smaller bundles create measurably better UX. The 130 kB you saved doesn‚Äôt just download faster. It also parses and executes faster on mobile CPUs.</p>
<p><strong>Hydration vs Resumability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional (React, Solid, Svelte, Vue, Angular)</strong>: Download bundle ‚Üí Parse JS ‚Üí Execute all components ‚Üí Attach event listeners (hydration)</li>
<li><strong>Marko</strong>: Download minimal JS ‚Üí Run effects and attach event listeners directly (fine-grained tree shaking, no re-execution of server code)</li>
<li><strong>Qwik</strong>: Download minimal JS ‚Üí Resume from serialized HTML ‚Üí Lazily load interaction handlers on demand</li>
</ul>
<p>Both Marko and Qwik are resumable frameworks that avoid traditional hydration. The key difference is that Qwik uses <em>lazy</em> resumability, progressively loading JavaScript based on actual interactions, while Marko analyzes the reactivity graph at build time to bundle exactly the code needed for events and effects; no lazy loading, but maximum precision in what gets shipped. Traditional frameworks must re-execute all components just to wire up event listeners.</p>
<h3 id="addressing-common-critiques">Addressing Common Critiques</h3>
<p>I know what some of you are thinking. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you comparing MPAs to SPAs unfairly?‚Äù And ‚ÄúIs this app complex enough?‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>App Complexity Defense</strong>: This isn‚Äôt some toy todo list. It‚Äôs a solid mid-complexity app with real database persistence using SQLite plus Drizzle ORM, relational queries across boards to lists to cards to tags and comments, drag-and-drop reordering, (some) optimistic updates, modals, and server validation. It matches the kind of internal tools or MVPs teams crank out every day. The bundle differences come straight from framework overhead, not the features themselves, and those gaps only get bigger at scale with more routes and dependencies. If your production app throws in auth or real-time stuff, framework baselines would just bloat even more, not shrink.</p>
<p><strong>MPA vs SPA Nuances</strong>: The routing pattern debate misses the point, reactivity models matter way more. With features like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API">View Transitions API</a> and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API">Speculation Rules API</a>, MPAs like Marko or HTMX feel just as snappy as SPAs for navigation. The real split is in scaling. MPAs ship minimal JS per page, for example Marko sticks to 6.8 to 28.8 kB, while SPAs lug around upfront runtime from 83.9 to 666.5 kB baselines plus chunks.</p>
<p><strong>A Note on Ecosystems</strong>: the ‚Äúsmall ecosystem‚Äù concern is often overstated. For mobile-first applications, we should be extremely selective about every dependency we add. Each package increases bundle size and maintenance burden. Modern AI tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor excel at generating focused code for your specific use case. Instead of importing a 50 kB library for 3 features, AI can help you write exactly what you need in 2 kB. This approach yields smaller bundles, code you actually understand, and <a href="https://github.blog/security/supply-chain-security/our-plan-for-a-more-secure-npm-supply-chain/">fewer supply chain risks</a>. Large ecosystems are sometimes advantageous, but they‚Äôre also a liability when every import costs your mobile users.</p>
<h2 id="does-complexity-buy-you-anything">Does Complexity Buy You Anything?</h2>
<p>If Next.js‚Äôs bundles are only 21 to 31% larger than TanStack Start (both using React), what are you actually getting for that extra 44 to 54 kB? And more importantly, do the dominant frameworks‚Äô baselines (React at 100.7 to 118.2 kB compressed, Vue at 72.3 kB compressed, Angular at 125.4 to 203.4 kB compressed) buy you anything compared to alternatives that deliver 30.6 to 54.1 kB compressed?</p>
<h3 id="the-complexity-tax">The Complexity Tax</h3>
<p>Each of the big three has conceptual complexity that alternatives avoid. React has rules around hooks and dependency arrays. Angular carries dependency injection patterns and RxJS complexity. Vue requires understanding refs and reactivity tracking. After seeing that TanStack Start (with React) only achieves marginal improvements over Next.js (21 to 31%), it‚Äôs clear that framework complexity and bundle weight often go hand-in-hand.

<p>The ‚Äúbig three‚Äù frameworks each carry conceptual complexity, though with different outcomes. React has rules around hooks and dependency arrays. Angular brings enterprise patterns like dependency injection alongside RxJS streams. Vue requires understanding refs and .value access, but unlike React and Angular, Vue (via Nuxt) has proven it can deliver competitive mobile web performance despite this complexity. These patterns become familiar with practice but never fully disappear and add cognitive overhead. Meta-frameworks compound these complexities: Next.js adds Server/Client boundaries and RSC serialization, Analog brings full Angular DI to the server, and Nuxt adds caching layers and composable patterns.</p>
<p>Most alternatives are conceptually simpler once learned. Svelte is most approachable (looks like enhanced HTML/JS). Solid and Marko use automatic tracking that eliminates manual dependency management. No rules of hooks, no dependency arrays, no .value boilerplate. The simpler mental models correlate with smaller bundles: less runtime complexity means less code to ship.</p>
<h2 id="does-nextjs-16s-built-in-compiler-change-anything">Does Next.js 16‚Äôs Built-in Compiler Change Anything?</h2>
<p>The React team recognizes the complexity problem. Their solution, now fully integrated in Next.js 16: the React Compiler automatically handles memoization to reduce re-renders.</p>
<h3 id="what-the-compiler-does">What the Compiler Does</h3>
<p>The React Compiler analyzes your code and inserts <code>useMemo</code> and <code>useCallback</code> automatically. In Next.js 16, this is no longer experimental; it‚Äôs built-in and enabled by default. It‚Äôs a genuine improvement that reduces boilerplate.</p>
<h3 id="the-results">The Results</h3>
<p>The compiler helps with re-render optimization and removes manual memoization boilerplate. But it doesn‚Äôt address Next.js‚Äôs bundle size: Next.js ships 176.3 kB compressed (564.9 kB raw) for the board page while TanStack Start ships 118.2 kB compressed (373.6 kB raw) with the same React 19. The compiler can‚Äôt eliminate dependency arrays for <code>useEffect</code>. You still need to understand hooks, closures, and React‚Äôs rendering model.</p>
<h3 id="the-irony">The Irony</h3>
<p>The compiler improves React‚Äôs developer experience, which is valuable. But it highlights an interesting contrast. React optimizes Virtual DOM re-renders, while alternatives like SolidStart eliminate re-renders entirely through fine-grained reactivity. SvelteKit‚Äôs compiler eliminates much of the runtime overhead at build time. Qwik eliminates hydration cost through resumability.</p>
<p>The difference in philosophy is clear. React‚Äôs compiler optimizes the existing model. The alternatives questioned the model itself.</p>
<h2 id="the-web-is-the-last-commons-why-this-matters-beyond-frameworks">The Web is the Last Commons: Why This Matters Beyond Frameworks</h2>
<p>Here‚Äôs where this gets bigger than framework choice. When you ship a native app to the App Store or Google Play instead of building a web app, you‚Äôre not just making a technical decision. You‚Äôre accepting a deal that would‚Äôve been unthinkable twenty years ago. Apple and Google each take up to 30% of every transaction (with exceptions depending on program and category). They set rules. They decide what you can ship. They can revoke your access tomorrow with no recourse. You have no alternative market. You can‚Äôt even compete on price because the fee is baked into many transactions.</p>
<p>Economist Yanis Varoufakis calls this ‚Äútechnofeudalism‚Äù in his book of the same name. The App Store isn‚Äôt a marketplace, it‚Äôs a fiefdom. Developers are digital serfs, bound to the cloud lords‚Äô land (their platforms) with no exit. Users get locked into this too. The App Store is a curated garden where algorithms owned by two companies decide what you see. Your data gets harvested. Your choices get filtered. You‚Äôre not a customer with alternatives, you‚Äôre a subject in a walled garden.</p>
<p>The web? The web is different. No single company takes a cut. No algorithm curates your choices. Distribution is direct. Users can actually vote with their feet. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs the closest thing we have left to an open market where developers retain agency and users retain choice.</p>
<p>When companies abandon the web to go app-only, they‚Äôre not making a neutral technical decision. They‚Äôre voluntarily moving their users from a competitive marketplace into a feudal system. And yeah, I know that sounds dramatic, but Varoufakis has spent years documenting how the economics of digital platforms have created exactly this dynamic.</p>
<p><strong>Why you should care, no matter what you believe:</strong></p>
<p>If you lean capitalist, app stores create an environment that is the opposite of what capitalism is supposed to be. Monopolistic rent extraction replacing competition and innovation. No market mechanism to challenge them. That‚Äôs not capitalism, that‚Äôs just extraction.</p>
<p>If you lean anti-capitalist, technofeudalism is arguably worse than regular capitalism because at least capitalism has friction and regulatory handles. This has neither. It‚Äôs total private control with zero market competition.</p>
<p>Either way, the web is the last place where economic activity can happen outside the thumb of tech oligarchs. Building web apps matters. Shipping small, fast, performant web apps matters even more, and most web traffic comes from the mobile web. Every kilobyte you save is another reason for teams to choose the web over building a native app subject to app store control and fees.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-what-this-evaluation-revealed">Conclusion: What This Evaluation Revealed</h2>
<p>What started as a simple framework comparison for an upcoming work project turned into something more revealing. The data shows clearly what‚Äôs possible when frameworks prioritize mobile web performance from the start.</p>
<p>The evaluation revealed what happens when you rethink fundamentals. SolidStart, SvelteKit, Qwik, and Marko represent different architectural priorities that push boundaries in ways the dominant frameworks cannot. Competition drives innovation. These alternatives show what‚Äôs achievable when mobile web performance is the primary design constraint, not an afterthought.</p>
<p>For teams serving mobile professionals on cellular networks (like ours), these costs are paid on every visit. React and Angular often face architectural performance ceilings. Vue proved that established frameworks can compete when properly configured. And remember, these measurements represent initial page loads. MPA frameworks maintain their lean profile across routes, while SPAs add route chunks to their baseline.</p>
<p>For anyone starting a new project, the evaluation raises an important question: <strong>Is there any reason to make your app 25.9x heavier than necessary?</strong> (And that‚Äôs before adding the authentication, analytics, and third party libraries that typically multiply production bundle sizes 5 to 10 times, making the real world gap even larger.) Building an app that works well on mobile isn‚Äôt difficult if you make good architectural decisions at the beginning. The right choice early on means your app performs well everywhere, not just on desktop WiFi. Choose MPA frameworks for the leanest per page bundles, or lightweight SPAs for excellent performance with familiar patterns.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs what the evaluation made clear: <strong>if you want to build a better product than your competitors, why would you build exactly like them?</strong> When everyone uses Next.js, winning on performance requires fighting React‚Äôs architecture. When you use Marko, SolidStart, SvelteKit, or Nuxt instead, the advantage comes easily. Your app is faster by default. Your bundle is smaller without optimization work. Your users get a better experience without extra effort. That‚Äôs not just good engineering. That‚Äôs differentiation.</p>
<p>When you pick Marko and ship 28.8 kB instead of Next.js at 176.3 kB, you‚Äôre not just making your users‚Äô experience better on cellular networks. You‚Äôre making the web more competitive. You‚Äôre making it a more attractive place for companies to exist. You‚Äôre pushing back against the gravity that pulls everything toward native only distribution.</p>
<h2 id="reproducing-these-results">Reproducing These Results</h2>
<p>All measurements in this comparison follow a rigorous statistical methodology designed for reproducibility and defensibility. Each framework was measured 10 times per page using Chrome Lighthouse with mobile emulation (Pixel 5, 4G throttling, 1x CPU). Server warmup requests stabilize performance before measurements. IQR (Interquartile Range) outlier removal ensures robust statistics. Browser cache was cleared between runs to measure cold-load performance that simulates first-visit experience. I report median values to reduce the impact of outliers, and standard deviations quantify measurement reliability. The complete methodology including statistical approach, test environment details, compression detection, known limitations, and reproducibility instructions is documented at <a href="https://github.com/lorenseanstewart/kanban-comparison/blob/main/METHODOLOGY.md">METHODOLOGY.md</a>.</p>
<h2 id="call-to-action">Call to Action</h2>
<p><strong>Try it yourself</strong>: Clone the <a href="https://github.com/lorenseanstewart/kanban-comparison">repository</a>, build all ten implementations, and test them on a throttled 3G connection in Chrome DevTools. When mobile web is your only option, the numbers tell a clear story.</p>
<p><strong>On a less serious note</strong>: You can take a look at all ten apps to examine how the code looks and get a general feel for each framework. I advocate coding for fun, and the code in the repo might be a great place to help you try something new.</p>
<p><strong>Share your experience</strong>: Have you tried Marko, SolidStart, SvelteKit, Qwik, or Nuxt? What framework would you choose for a mobile-first project and why? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on Twitter or Bluesky.</p>
<p><strong>Keep exploring</strong>: The full metrics data and measurement methodology are available in the repository for you to verify, reproduce, or extend. Build your own comparison and share your findings.</p>
<p>The real winner? You. Your team. Your users. When you start your next project with Marko, SolidStart, or SvelteKit, you‚Äôll ship faster, smaller, and with less framework overhead. That‚Äôs a real competitive advantage.</p>

<p>No his¬≠tor¬≠i¬≠cal fig¬≠ure bet¬≠ter fits the def¬≠i¬≠n¬≠i¬≠tion of ‚ÄúRenais¬≠sance man‚Äù than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci">Leonar¬≠do da Vin¬≠ci</a>, but that term has become so overused as to become mis¬≠lead¬≠ing. We use it to express mild sur¬≠prise that one per¬≠son could use both their left and right hemi¬≠spheres equal¬≠ly well. But in Leonardo‚Äôs day, peo¬≠ple did not think of them¬≠selves as hav¬≠ing two brains, and the worlds of art and sci¬≠ence were not so far apart as they are now.</p>
<p>That Leonar¬≠do was able to com¬≠bine fine arts and fine engi¬≠neer¬≠ing may not have been over¬≠ly sur¬≠pris¬≠ing to his con¬≠tem¬≠po¬≠raries, though he was an extra¬≠or¬≠di¬≠nar¬≠i¬≠ly bril¬≠liant exam¬≠ple of the phe¬≠nom¬≠e¬≠non. The more we learn about him, the more we see how close¬≠ly relat¬≠ed the two pur¬≠suits were in his mind.</p>


<p>He approached every¬≠thing he did as a tech¬≠ni¬≠cian. The uncan¬≠ny effects he achieved in paint¬≠ing were the result, as in so much Renais¬≠sance art, of math¬≠e¬≠mat¬≠i¬≠cal pre¬≠ci¬≠sion, care¬≠ful study, and first¬≠hand obser¬≠va¬≠tion.</p>

<p>His artis¬≠tic projects were also exper¬≠i¬≠ments. Some of them failed, as most exper¬≠i¬≠ments do, and some he aban¬≠doned, as he did so many sci¬≠en¬≠tif¬≠ic projects. No mat¬≠ter what, he nev¬≠er under¬≠took any¬≠thing, whether mechan¬≠i¬≠cal, anatom¬≠i¬≠cal, or artis¬≠tic, with¬≠out care¬≠ful plan¬≠ning and design, as his copi¬≠ous note¬≠books tes¬≠ti¬≠fy. As more and more of those note¬≠books have become avail¬≠able online, both Renais¬≠sance schol¬≠ars and laypeo¬≠ple alike have learned con¬≠sid¬≠er¬≠ably more about how Leonardo‚Äôs mind worked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo oth¬≠er col¬≠lec¬≠tion counts more orig¬≠i¬≠nal papers writ¬≠ten by Leonar¬≠do,‚Äù <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/rwKy3jZHwWiyJA">notes Google</a>. The <em>Codex Atlanti¬≠cus</em> ‚Äúcon¬≠sists of 1119 papers, most of them drawn or writ¬≠ten on both sides.‚Äù Its name has ‚Äúnoth¬≠ing to do with the Atlantic Ocean, or with some eso¬≠teric, mys¬≠te¬≠ri¬≠ous con¬≠tent hid¬≠den in its pages.‚Äù The 12-vol¬≠ume col¬≠lec¬≠tion acquired its title because the draw¬≠ings and writ¬≠ings were bound with the same size paper that was used for mak¬≠ing atlases. Gath¬≠ered in the 16th cen¬≠tu¬≠ry by sculp¬≠tor Pom¬≠peo Leoni, the papers descend¬≠ed from Leonardo‚Äôs close stu¬≠dent Gio¬≠van Francesco Melzi, who was entrust¬≠ed with them after his teacher‚Äôs death.</p>
<p>The his¬≠to¬≠ry of the Codex itself makes for a fas¬≠ci¬≠nat¬≠ing nar¬≠ra¬≠tive, much of which you can learn at Google‚Äôs <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/rwKy3jZHwWiyJA">Ten Key Facts slideshow</a>. The note¬≠books span Leonardo‚Äôs career, from 1478, when he was ‚Äústill work¬≠ing in his native Tus¬≠cany, to 1519, when he died in France.‚Äù The col¬≠lec¬≠tion was tak¬≠en from Milan by Napoleon and brought to France, where it remained in the Lou¬≠vre until 1815, when the Con¬≠gress of Vien¬≠na ruled that all art¬≠works stolen by the for¬≠mer Emper¬≠or be returned. (The emis¬≠sary tasked with return¬≠ing the Codex could not deci¬≠pher Leonardo‚Äôs mir¬≠ror writ¬≠ing and took it for Chi¬≠nese.)</p>
