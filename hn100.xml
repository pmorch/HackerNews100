                </div><p>Bhargav Krishna, an air pollution expert at New Delhi-based Sustainable Futures Collaborative, called the loss of data “a big blow” to air quality research. </p><p>“They were part of a handful of sensors in many developing countries and served as a reference for understanding what air quality was like,” Krishna said. “They were also seen to be a well-calibrated and unbiased source of data to cross-check local data if there were concerns about quality.” </p>
    
<p>“It’s a real shame”, said Alejandro Piracoca Mayorga, a Bogota, Colombia-based freelance air quality consultant. U.S. embassies and consulates in Lima, Peru, Sao Paulo and Bogota have had the public air monitoring. “It was a source of access to air quality information independent of local monitoring networks. They provided another source of information for comparison.”</p><p>Khalid Khan, an environmental expert and advocate based in Pakistan, agreed, saying the shutdown of air quality monitoring will “have significant consequences.” </p><div data-align-center="">

He said vulnerable people in Pakistan and around the world are particularly at risk as they are the least likely to have access to other reliable data.</p>

Some of those countries depend almost entirely on the U.S. monitoring systems for their air quality data. </p><p>The WHO’s air quality database will also be affected by the closing of U.S. program. Many poor countries don’t track air quality because stations are too expensive and complex to maintain, meaning they are entirely reliant on U.S. embassy monitoring data. </p><h2>Monitors strengthened local efforts</h2><div data-align-center="">

</p><p>Volkswagen AG became a global car giant thanks to the Beetle, an affordable model for the masses. Now, the German automaker is finally <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/mobility-for-everyone-with-the-id-every1-volkswagen-is-providing-a-preview-of-an-entry-level-electric-model-19039" target="_blank">unveiling a budget car for the electric-vehicle age</a> as it tries to catch up with Chinese brands and other rivals with cheaper options.
      	  			            

</p><p>VW on March 5 presented the compact ID. EVERY1 concept car that will cost around €20,000 ($21,000) — its lowest-priced EV yet. The first VW-brand model to use electric architecture jointly developed with Rivian Automotive Inc., it’s due to start production in two years at an undecided location in Europe.
      	  			            

</p><p>The model will offer more than 155 miles of range and is the “last piece of the puzzle” for VW’s next-generation lineup, said Thomas Schaefer, CEO of the brand.
      	    </p>
      	  			            

<p>European carmakers are struggling to convince consumers to make the switch to EVs given their higher sticker prices and lingering concern around charging infrastructure.
      	  			            

</p><p>VW is seeking to regain ground on rivals with its own cheaper EV models after a year where sales slumped. Like other German manufacturers, VW initially focused its efforts on premium EVs to offset high development and battery costs. Tech enthusiasts and subsidies helped bolster a first wave of EV growth, but demand has stagnated on a dearth of affordable models, rising inflation and high electricity costs.
      	  			            

</p>

<p>VW’s tumbling sales were accompanied by a painful restructuring hammered out with unions in 2024, making it “one of the most challenging years of Volkswagen’s history,” Schaefer said at an event in Düsseldorf, Germany. “After everything we’ve been through, this gives us back our confidence and powerful sense of momentum — and to be frank, that’s exactly what we needed,” he said.
      	  			            

</p><p>The ID. EVERY1 will follow VW’s ID. 2all, which launches next year at a starting price of €25,000.
      	  			            

</p><p>“They’re bringing an affordable electric vehicle to the masses that will enable them to compete with Chinese entrants,” independent autos analyst Matthias Schmidt said.
      	  			            

</p><p>VW’s more affordable models won’t be ready in 2025, which means Europe’s biggest automaker has a tighter window to ramp up sales and meet the European Union’s carbon dioxide emissions targets.
      	  			            

</p><p>And there’s no guarantee of financial success, according to UBS analyst Patrick Hummel. “In the past they struggled to make money with small cars in the combustion era,” Hummel said. “And with EVs, it’s going to be even more challenging.”

<p>The ID. 2all and the ID. EVERY1 will be the first VW models to use lithium iron phosphate batteries, which are cheaper, longer lasting and charge more quickly, but aren’t as resilient to temperature fluctuations.
      	  			            

</p><p>VW’s foray into EVs was marred by software glitches that culminated in the ousting in 2022 of former CEO Herbert Diess.
      	  			            

</p><p>His successor Oliver Blume’s efforts to catch up with Tesla Inc. were hindered by soaring inflation that put a lid on consumer spending. The arrival of cheaper Chinese brands led by BYD Co. didn’t help.
      	  			            

</p><p>The car will compete with budget models already unveiled by rivals, including Renault SA’s Twingo E-Tech and Citroën’s ë-C3 city car, which will both have price tags starting at less than €20,000.
      	  			            

</p><p>VW is seeking to restore its former glory. Until 2022, the Golf was Europe’s top-selling car for 14 years straight. The Golf and affordable Polo have sold more than 57 million units combined since their introduction in the mid-1970s.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The Take It Down Act is an overbroad, poorly drafted bill that would create a powerful system to pressure removal of internet posts, with essentially no safeguards. While the bill is meant to address a serious problem—the distribution of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII)—the notice-and-takedown system it creates is an open invitation for powerful people to pressure websites into removing content they dislike. There are no penalties for applying very broad, or even farcical definitions of what constitutes NCII, and then demanding that it be removed. </span><span data-ccp-props="278}">&nbsp;</span></p>

There is nothing in the law, as written, to stop anyone—especially those with significant resources—from misusing the notice-and-takedown system to remove speech that criticizes them or that they disagree with. </span><span data-ccp-props="278}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Trump has frequently targeted platforms carrying content and speakers of entirely legal speech that is critical of him, both </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/05/newly-released-records-show-how-trump-tried-retaliate-against-social-media-fact"><span data-contrast="none">as</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/first-trump-doj-assembled-tiger-team-rewrite-key-law-protecting-online-speech"><span data-contrast="none">an</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/trumps-blocking-people-his-twitter-account-violates-first-amendment-eff-tells-court"><span data-contrast="none">elected</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/trumps-ban-tiktok-violates-first-amendment-eliminating-unique-platform-political"><span data-contrast="none">official</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/12/trump-free-speech-and-freedom-press"><span data-contrast="none">as a private citizen</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.&nbsp; He has filed </span><a href="http://www.medialaw.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=3470"><span data-contrast="none">frivolous lawsuits</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> against media defendants which threaten to silence critics and draw scarce resources away from important reporting work. </span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="278}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Now that Trump issued a call to action for the bill in his remarks, there is a possibility that House Republicans will fast track the bill into a spending package as soon as next week. Non-consensual intimate imagery is a serious problem that deserves serious consideration, not a hastily drafted, overbroad bill that sweeps in legal, protected speech.</span><span data-ccp-props="278}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">How The Take It Down Act Could Silence People</span></b><span data-ccp-props="278}">&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A few weeks ago, a "deepfake" video of </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/fake-video-trump-kissing-musks-feet-displayed-hud-office-washington-rcna193503"><span data-contrast="none">President Trump and Elon Musk</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> was displayed across various monitors in the Housing and Urban Development office. The video was subsequently shared on various platforms. While most people wouldn't consider this video, which displayed faked footage of Trump kissing Elon Musk's feet, "nonconsensual intimate imagery," the takedown provision of the bill applies to an “identifiable individual” engaged in “sexually explicit conduct.” This definition leaves much room for interpretation, and nudity or graphic displays are not necessarily required. </span><span data-ccp-props="278}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Moreover, there are no penalties whatsoever to dissuade a requester from simply insisting that content is NCII. Apps and websites only have 48 hours to remove content once they receive a request, which means they won’t be able to verify claims. Especially if the requester is an elected official with the power to start an investigation or prosecution, what website would stand up to such a request? </span><span data-ccp-props="278}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">The House Must Not Pass This Dangerous Bill</span></b><span data-ccp-props="278}">&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Congress should focus on </span><a href="https://www.findlaw.com/criminal/criminal-charges/revenge-porn-laws-by-state.html"><span data-contrast="none">enforcing and improving</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> the many existing civil and criminal laws that address NCII, rather than opting for a broad takedown regime that is bound to be abused. Take It Down would likely lead to the use of often-inaccurate automated filters that are infamous for </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/takedowns/automated-copyright-filter-cant-detect-infringement-or-irony"><span data-contrast="none">flagging legal content</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, from fair-use commentary to news reporting. It will threaten encrypted services, which may respond by abandoning encryption entirely in order to be able to monitor content—turning private conversations into surveilled spaces.</span><span data-ccp-props="278}">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="278}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Protecting victims of NCII is a legitimate goal. But good intentions alone are not enough to make good policy. Tell your Member of Congress to oppose censorship and to oppose H.R.633.</span><span data-ccp-props="278}">&nbsp;</span></p>

    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>I’ve written quite a lot of free software in my life. Most of
      it was from scratch: projects I started myself. So I get to
      choose where to host them – or rather, I <em>have</em> to choose
      where to host them.</p>
    <p>These days, all my projects are held in Git. And mostly, I put
      them in ‘bare’ git repositories on my personal website.</p>
    <p>I don’t use any git ‘forge’ system layered on top of Git, like
      Gitlab or Github, which automatically makes a bug tracking
      database for each project, and provides a convenient button for
      a user to open a merge request / pull request. I just use plain
      Git. People can ‘<code>git clone</code>’ my code, and there’s a
      web-based browsing interface (the basic <code>gitweb</code>) for
      looking around without having to clone it at all. But that’s all
      the automated facilities you get.</p>
    <p>Occasionally this confuses people, so I thought I should write
      something about it.</p>
    <h3 id="purpose">Purposes of this article</h3>
    <p>Sometimes people just can’t work out how to send me patches at
      all. Or they can think of several ways, and aren’t sure which is
      best. So one purpose of this article is to be a public statement
      of my own preferences, which I can link to when people ask that
      question.</p>
    <p>But it’s also a bit of a musing about <em>why</em> I don’t use
      a ‘forge’ style system like Gitlab or Github. People sometimes
      ask me that too – “why don’t you do what everyone else does?” or
      words to that effect.</p>
    <h2 id="submissions">How to interact with a bare git repo</h2>
    <p>People who are used to git forges look for a ‘pull request’
      button. When they don’t find it, they sometimes get confused.</p>
    <p>If you can’t find a button on a website to submit a patch, how
      do you send your patch to the maintainer?</p>
    <p>You send the author an email. And in the email, you put one of
      these things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A URL to your own clone of the repository, containing your
        patches on top of the ‘upstream’ code.</li>
      <li>The actual patches, in some form of email attachment.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Either of these works. For option 2 there are multiple ways to
      do it in detail, and all of <em>those</em> work too.</p>
    <p>It doesn’t have to be by email, either. Any method of sending
      this data to the maintainer is fine. For example, I’m on
      Mastodon – so you could send me a repository URL via Mastodon if
      you really wanted to (provided you didn’t mind my responses
      being very short). Or you could send patches via any other
      communications medium that you and the maintainer are both on,
      if it lets you attach files to messages.</p>
    <h3 id="preferences">What do I prefer in particular?</h3>
    <p>But some people don’t just want to know <em>any</em> way to
      send patches. They want to know which is the <em>best</em> way,
      or at least the way I prefer.</p>
    <p>So here’s my own list, in descending order: most preferred at
      the top, least at the bottom.</p>
    <h4 id="url">BEST: URL of a git repository + branch name</h4>
    <p>This is my <em>absolute</em> favourite way to receive patches.
      If there’s anywhere on the Internet you can put a clone of my
      git repository with some extra patches, then the best thing is
      to do that, and send me an email saying something like</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I have some patches to [project] to [make some change]. You
        can find them in the branch called [whatever] here: [URL]</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The URL can be anything that’s convenient, as long as it’s
      either something I can give to <code>git clone</code>, or a
      human-readable web page <em>containing</em> something I can give
      to <code>git clone</code>. It can be anything from a git forge
      page (just because <em>I</em> don’t host my code on Github
      doesn’t mean you can’t put your patched version there for me to
      look at) to a static site where you’ve uploaded a repository and
      run <code>git update-server-info</code>.</p>
    <p>When you get right down to it, this is exactly what the
      formalised ‘pull request’ or ‘merge request’ in a git forge
      system <em>is</em>. That’s why you start by forking (i.e.
      cloning) the target repository and put your changes in a branch
      of your fork. A PR communicates to the maintainer: “Hey, see
      this repo over here, this branch in particular? It has changes
      I’d like you to take.” The formal PR button in a forge is a way
      to do that with one click, but a short email with all the same
      information is just as good.</p>
    <p><em>Why I like it</em>: This is my favourite way to receive
      patches because the patches themselves don’t go through my
      email. This saves space for me in the long term (I keep all my
      email), and it saves me messing about with moving attachments
      around (I read email on a different machine from the one I
      develop on). All I need is to paste the URL from the email into
      my git command line, and bing, I’ve got the patches in a form I
      can look at, review, and maybe merge.</p>
    <p>Also, if I make review comments and you want to update the
      patches, it saves space <em>again</em> if you don’t have to send
      a full set of updated patch files, but instead, push a modified
      version of your branch and just send another email saying</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>OK, I’ve addressed those review comments. New patches are in
        the same place as before.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4 id="bundle">An incremental git bundle</h4>
    <p>Git bundles don’t seem to be very widely known. I think that’s
      a shame, because they’re awesome.</p>
    <p>The simplest kind of git bundle – a <em>full</em> bundle – is a
      whole git repository, wrapped up into a single file. It contains
      a collection of git objects, plus a collection of references
      (typically branch heads). You can access it by any of the same
      methods you’d use to access an actual git remote, by passing its
      filename to <code>git fetch</code> or <code>git pull</code>, or
      maybe start with <code>git ls-remote</code> to see what branches
      are in the bundle file and decide which one to fetch. The only
      thing you can’t usefully do is modify it. If you want a git
      bundle to contain something different, you just make a fresh one
      from scratch.</p>
    <p>But a bundle can also be <em>incremental</em>, which means that
      some objects are missing, because it expects the bundle
      recipient to have those objects already. This is just what you
      want when you’re sending patches against an existing repository:
      you know the recipient has all the objects you got from the
      original repo, and you only have to send the new objects.</p>
    <p>So, suppose you’ve prepared a series of commits (or just one
      commit) against the <code>main</code> branch of one of my
      repositories. Then you can do something like this:</p>
    <pre>git bundle create fix-weasel-rotator.bundle origin/main..HEAD</pre>
    <p>That will create a file called
      ‘<code>fix-weasel-rotator.bundle</code>’ (example name only!)
      which contains all the extra commits you’ve made on top
      of <code>origin/main</code> (my upstream branch). Now you can
      send that file as an attachment.</p>
    <p><em>Why I like it</em>: If I’m going to receive patches as
      email attachments at all, this is my favourite way to do it, for
      lots of reasons.</p>
    <p>Firstly, it’s <em>one</em> file, no matter how many patches you
      put in it. That means I can download it in one go to my
      development machine and not have to herd a whole collection of
      smaller files.</p>
    <p>Secondly, git bundles are <em>small</em>: significantly smaller
      than the corresponding textual patch files. (They use the same
      compression as git’s packed object format.)</p>
    <p>Thirdly, git bundles are <em>binary</em>: the compression turns
      them into completely impenetrable binary nonsense. That
      doesn’t <em>sound</em> like a good thing, but it does give email
      clients the best chance of transferring them completely
      unchanged, without trying to be clever (character set
      conversion, ‘helpfully’ rewrapping long lines).</p>
    <p>Perhaps most importantly, the commits in a git bundle are
      described in full detail: I can see what base commit you
      prepared them against, because they come with their parent
      links. So if I need to reapply the patches against a different
      parent, I know what parent I’m starting from, and what’s changed
      since then. This helps me to rebase the patches correctly. So
      does the fact that with the patches already in the form of git
      commits, I can use <code>git rebase</code> in the first place,
      and get its really nice conflict handling (better than <code>git
      am</code>).</p>
    <h4 id="format-patch">A set of patch files from <code>git
        format-patch</code></h4>
    <p>This is the most popular option people actually seem to choose:
      run ‘<code>git format-patch</code>’ to produce a sequence of
      textual patch files, one per commit, with names starting with
      0001, 0002, 0003, … so that the recipient can see what order
      they go in. Then send that lot as a pile of separate email
      attachments, or (rarely) in some single container like a zip
      file.</p>
    <p>I don’t think this is quite as nice as a git bundle, for a
      couple of reasons:</p>
    <p><em>Multiple files to herd</em>. When I get an email with five
      patch attachments, I have five files to copy around instead of
      one, with long awkward names.</p>
    <p><em>Text is vulnerable</em>. Because the patches are text
      files, there’s at least <em>some</em> chance that an MUA did
      something ‘helpful’ (not actually helpful) to them in transit.</p>
    <p><em>Harder to handle conflicts</em>. The <code>git am</code>
      command, which applies patches in this format, doesn’t handle
      conflicts in the way I most prefer, by applying the parts of the
      patch that worked and leaving in-file conflict markers at the
      places where something went wrong. Also, because <code>git
      format-patch</code> doesn’t mention what commit the
      patches <em>do</em> apply against, I’m more likely to encounter
      a conflict in the first place when trying to apply them.</p>
    <p>So, for all those reasons, I prefer a single binary git bundle
      citing its parent commit to a handful of text patch files. But
      these disadvantages don’t <em>normally</em> cause problems:
      the <code>format-patch</code> approach normally works well
      enough, and if it’s what a sender is happy with, I won’t spend
      any time trying to persuade them to do things differently.</p>
    <h4 id="diff">A bare diff file generated by <code>git diff</code></h4>
    <p>Plain <code>git diff</code> has all the same disadvantages
      of <code>git format-patch</code>, plus one extra downside: it
      doesn’t include the commit metadata: authorship and commit
      message.</p>
    <p>If you send me a plain <code>git diff</code>, I have to write
      the commit message myself. That either means understanding your
      patch well enough to know what your
      <em>intentions</em> were (maybe not the same as what you
      actually did!), or copying text out of the email you sent along
      with the patch.</p>
    <p>My <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/commit-messages/#cover">general advice</a> when
      submitting patches by email is that if you have an explanation
      of why the patch is desirable, or safe, or both, it’s better to
      put it in the commit message, so that it’s preserved for later
      people reading the git history. So you might as well put it
      there in the first place, and then I don’t have to move it!</p>
    <h4 id="send-email">WORST: A series of separate emails generated
        by <code>git send-email</code></h4>
    <p>Ugh, please, no. I really dislike receiving <code>git
      send-email</code> output. If you can <em>possibly</em> do it
      any other way, please do.</p>
    <p><em>Why I don’t like it</em>: because the patch series is split
      into multiple emails, they arrive in my inbox in a random order,
      and then I have to save them one by one to files, and manually
      sort those files back into the right order by their subject
      lines.</p>
    <p>With <code>git format-patch</code>, the files arrive as
      attachments to the same email, so I can save them all in one go,
      and then their names make it easy to sort them. <code>git
      send-email</code> has neither advantage.</p>
    <h2 id="why-not">Why don’t I use a git forge?</h2>
    <p>I promised I’d also talk about why I make this choice. Most
      people these days like git forges: why don’t I?</p>
    <h3 id="trust">Trust</h3>
    <p>For me, the first question in deciding where to host my code is
      not what facilities it provides, but who runs it. I want my code
      not to be at the mercy of people I don’t trust.</p>
    <p>I don’t mean that I have any especial <em>dis</em>trust of the
      organisations in charge of major Git forge websites. But I don’t
      know them personally, and I prefer to put my trust in people I
      do. So my git hosting arrangements live on a server run by a
      friend, instead of a server run by a company.</p>
    <p>Is that excessive paranoia on my part? I don’t think so.</p>
    <p>Perhaps it would be, if all my projects were low-stakes – not
      handling important secrets, and with very few users, so that
      they weren’t an attractive target for anyone to attack. But I
      maintain a security project, and also some of my stuff has
      become pretty popular. Even something completely frivolous like
      a videogame can be an attractive target if it’s installed on a
      lot of machines.</p>
    <p>Admittedly, this was a more serious concern before Git: the
      nature of Git’s commit hashing system is that it’s very
      difficult to quietly change the content of a repository to
      something malicious, without everyone who already had a clone of
      it noticing. In the Subversion days it was much easier to
      quietly hack a repository’s contents if you had admin access.</p>
    <p>But ‘difficult’ isn’t <em>impossible</em>, so it still seems
      worth taking some care.</p>
    <p>Trusting a company is also dangerous because management
      changes: even if you trust the people in charge <em>now</em>,
      they may not be in charge next year, and the people who are may
      be completely different. The same facilities that attract users
      to Github now would have attracted people to Sourceforge a
      couple of decades ago – and Sourceforge now has a pretty bad
      reputation.</p>
    <h3 id="heavy">Heavyweight</h3>
    <p>Of course, using a well-known forge <em>website</em> and using
      forge <em>software</em> aren’t the same thing. If I don’t want
      to host my code on <code>gitlab.com</code>, I could still
      arrange to run my own instance of the Gitlab <em>software</em>
      somewhere under my own control, and use that.</p>
    <p>From everything I’ve heard, that’s a lot more effort than
      hosting a plain git repository. I don’t think the overall
      convenience gain is worth the large amount of effort it would
      cost me to run a thing like that. It would take away from time
      I’d rather be spending on the actual code.</p>
    <h3 id="accounts">Account management</h3>
    <p>A particular thing I don’t like about git forge websites is the
      way they make you create an account.</p>
    <p>Even to <em>report a bug</em> against someone else’s project –
      let alone send a patch – if it’s hosted in some Gitlab instance
      I haven’t used before, I have to make an account on that
      instance, because until I do that, I can’t interact with the
      system at all. And it’s not <em>just</em> instances I haven’t
      used before: at least some Gitlab instances will delete old
      accounts, so that even if I <em>have</em> interacted with a
      project before, when I find another bug in the same software
      years later I might still have to make a fresh account.</p>
    <p>Making accounts is a <em>bad thing</em>. Every one of them is
      an extra thing to track in your password manager; some kind of
      2FA setup if the site insists on it; periodic need to spend
      effort on it (like if the site notifies you that they’ve had a
      compromise and you need to reconfirm something); an outright
      risk (like if a <em>scammer</em> pretending to be the site sends
      you a fraudulent notification of that kind); an extra facet of
      your online identity to keep track of. Each one is individually
      small, but they add up, and managing a ton of accounts is
      annoying. I don’t enjoy having to do that myself, and I don’t
      want to inflict it on other people!</p>
    <h3 id="workflow">You get a workflow imposed on you</h3>
    <p>Git forge websites come with a bunch of stuff beyond the plain
      git repository. That’s their whole point.</p>
    <p>In particular, your project automatically gets a bug tracker –
      and you don’t get a choice about what bug tracker to use, or
      what it looks like. If you use Gitlab, you’re using the Gitlab
      bug tracker. The same goes for the pull request / merge request
      system.</p>
    <p>When I started using Git, PuTTY already <em>had</em> a bug
      tracker. A pretty simple one – not much more than a set of text
      files and a script that turns them into a set of web pages – but
      it’s there, and it integrates with our source control and
      releases and website in ways we’re familiar with. Throw it away
      in favour of a thing tied to the hosting system which doesn’t
      behave the way we carefully chose? No thanks.</p>
    <p>More generally, I don’t want that kind of decision about my
      development workflows to be a consequence of some unrelated
      thing like what version control I’m using. I want to
      decide <em>first</em> how to handle patches and bug reports, and
      then decide what software will best serve those needs – not the
      other way round.</p>
    <h3 id="inertia">Plain old inertia</h3>
    <p>I wouldn’t want anyone to think I was <em>concealing</em> this
      reason, or deluding myself that it wasn’t part of my
      motivations, so I should make sure to say it out loud.</p>
    <p>One reason I don’t use a forge is simply because I
      didn’t <em>start out</em> using a forge, and moving all my stuff
      into one would be effort. I’ve been providing public source
      repositories since before Git was a thing, and before forges
      themselves were a thing. (OK, not <em>quite</em> before the
      pre-Git Sourceforge was actually founded, but before it was well
      known.) Before Git, my stuff was hosted in SVN on a particular
      Linux box; when I moved my stuff from SVN to Git, the path of
      changing as little as possible was to host it in Git on the same
      Linux box.</p>
    <p>Of course, that’s not a good reason by itself. And that’s all
      right – it’s not my <em>only</em> reason. But I can’t deny that
      it’s <em>one</em> of my reasons. Change is effort, and ought to
      give enough benefit to be worth the effort.</p>
    <h3 id="github">Special mention: especially not Github</h3>
    <p>For all these reasons, I don’t really want to use <em>any</em>
      git forge. But I <em>particularly</em> don’t want to use
      Github.</p>
    <p>The biggest reason is that it’s not itself free software. If
      you want to take back control of your project by moving it to
      another instance of the same system (perhaps even setting up
      your own), you can do that with Gitlab – migrating all your bug
      records along with the git repository – but not with Github.
      You’re locked in.</p>
    <p>Also, I might as well come out and say this: one reason I don’t
      want to use Github is <em>because</em> it’s the most popular
      place to host your code. It’s almost never healthy to have a
      monoculture of <em>anything</em>, and a monoculture controlled
      by a single company is particularly dangerous. I’d rather
      contribute to the Internet being distributed than contribute to
      it being centralised.</p>
    <p>(I get particularly annoyed when people demand I move to Github
      for this reason. “Everyone is on Github, get with the programme!
      Conform!” I’m actually less likely to do it <em>because</em> you
      said that. Ugh.)</p>
    <p>Of course, these days Github is owned by Microsoft, and there
      are plenty of people who don’t 100% trust Microsoft. I can’t
      claim to be completely immune to that, but I <em>already</em>
      didn’t want to use Github before it was bought, so that’s not my
      only reason. Not even my main reason.</p>
    <h2 id="why-so">Should I start using a git forge instead?</h2>
    <p>Sometimes I get email from people who would prefer me to start
      doing things the ‘normal’ way. It’s not <em>always</em> just
      because my way isn’t what they’re already used to. Some of them
      have more interesting and thoughtful reasons.</p>
    <p>The most interesting comment I’ve had along these lines is that
      a forge puts all your interactions with contributors out in the
      open. If someone is considering contributing to your code base,
      they can look at past MRs / PRs and see what happened: whether
      there seems to be an active community at all, whether the
      developer(s) respond to contributions in good time, whether the
      reviews seem constructive, whether there’s any obnoxious or
      toxic behaviour going on. And then maybe decide not to waste
      their time on that project at all, if it doesn’t look
      welcoming or helpful.</p>
    <p>With my approach, where each discussion of a contribution
      happens in private email, it is true that the process of making
      a contribution is a lot less public. I could be amazingly rude
      to one contributor, and none of the others would necessarily
      find out about it (unless the hypothetical victim ranted about
      it on their blog, or something). I could take ages to get round
      to doing anything (for any reason – laziness or overloading or
      anything in between). I could lie to each contributor about what
      other contributors were doing (although I can’t think of any
      reason it would even be in my own interest to!)</p>
    <p>So I accept that there are downsides of doing it my way, as
      well as upsides. Forges aren’t a complete waste of time. I just
      haven’t yet been convinced that the advantages of a forge
      outweigh the disadvantages.</p>
    <p>But I’d be more interested in thoughts about how to get the
      best of both worlds. If there were a system for allowing
      contributions and their review and discussion to happen in
      public, using software much more lightweight and easier to run
      than Gitlab, which allowed contribution without requiring anyone
      to create and manage yet another account, with an extremely
      configurable form of workflow management (if any), and having a
      hard separation between the discussion-forum layer and the
      actual git repository so that a compromise wouldn’t allow
      injecting malware into the target project, I’d be interested in
      giving it a look!</p>
    <p>(Of course, just occasionally a contribution <em>does</em> have
      to happen via private communication, e.g. because it’s a fix for
      a not-yet-public security issue. I certainly wouldn’t want
      to <em>stop</em> people from contributing privately, if it was
      necessary, or just if that was what they preferred.)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This is some really embarrassing timing on the Home Office’s (HO’s) part: a few weeks ago when <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgj54eq4vejo">news first broke of the HO’s demand for a backdoor in Apple ADP</a>, I pointed out to MP David Davis that the HO actually extolled use of ADP by at-risk groups:</p>



<hr>



<figure></figure>



<p>That screenshot was current to that day. What I did not expect was that in the interim between then and the new revelation that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8rkpv50x01o">Apple are taking the matter to (again, secret) court</a>, the people at NCSC would <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/defending-democracy/guidance-for-high-risk-individuals">apparently rewrite the whole document, rename it, broaden the audience, and water it down</a> by eliding the advice to enable and use ADP, as discovered by Pat Walshe… or at least that’s what happened on the face of it:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Instead they now call for use of Apple’s “Lockdown Mode”, and I checked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/runasand_four-things-to-know-about-lockdown-mode-activity-7184158735693426688-ElOq/">noted Lockdown Mode advocate Runa Sandvik</a> who confirms for me that Lockdown Mode is a separate feature from ADP, with a different remit from cloud data protection. Enabling one does not enable the other.</p>



<p>But this is where it gets weird, because suddenly I noticed a different URL was being shown in the browser bar, and then I found that <a href="https://www.glitchcat.xyz/p/a-look-at-the-uks-cybersecurity-guidance">writing in April 2024, Runa observed some weaknesses</a> in NCSC’s (contemporary) “Defending Democracy” guidance:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Also missing are any mentions of encrypted phone backups for Android and iOS; end-to-end encryption for&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108756">iCloud</a>; and end-to-end encryption for&nbsp;<a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/1246476872801203/">WhatsApp</a> backups. […] should also include Google’s Advanced Protection Program (and Google should mention it more too).”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So the document we are looking at <em>today</em> also existed <em>back then</em>, with the same deficiencies … which leads us to presume that <em>the politically inconvenient ADP-promoting “for barristers” document has actually been wholesale <strong>deleted from the internet</strong>, with a HTTP redirect put in place to point to the inferior “defending democracy” documents.</em></p>



<p>And lo, what do we find?</p>



<blockquote>
<p>$ curl -s -L -I -A “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:110.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/110.0” https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/cyber-security-tips-for-barristers-solicitors-and-legal-professionals | grep location:</p>



<p>location: <strong>/collection/defending-democracy/guidance-for-high-risk-individuals</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Confirmation. So the question in my mind is: is the UK Government attempting to cover-up its previous advocacy of ADP, by censoring this old document? Or does it instead want the UK legal profession to avoid use of ADP and to what end?</p>

Recent studies have demonstrated that RL can significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of models. For instance, DeepSeek R1 has achieved state-of-the-art performance by integrating cold-start data and multi-stage training, enabling deep thinking and complex reasoning.</p><p>Our research explores the scalability of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and its impact on enhancing the intelligence of large language models. We are excited to introduce QwQ-32B, a model with 32 billion parameters that achieves performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1, which boasts 671 billion parameters (with 37 billion activated). This remarkable outcome underscores the effectiveness of RL when applied to robust foundation models pretrained on extensive world knowledge. Furthermore, we have integrated agent-related capabilities into the reasoning model, enabling it to think critically while utilizing tools and adapting its reasoning based on environmental feedback. These advancements not only demonstrate the transformative potential of RL but also pave the way for further innovations in the pursuit of artificial general intelligence.</p><p>QwQ-32B is open-weight in <a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B">Hugging Face</a> and <a href="https://modelscope.cn/models/Qwen/QwQ-32B">ModelScope</a> under the Apache 2.0 license and is accessible via <a href="https://chat.qwen.ai/?models=Qwen2.5-Plus">Qwen Chat</a>.</p><h2 id="performance">Performance</h2><p>QwQ-32B is evaluated across a range of benchmarks designed to assess its mathematical reasoning, coding proficiency, and general problem-solving capabilities. The results below highlight QwQ-32B’s performance in comparison to other leading models, including DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-Qwen-32B, DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-Llama-70B, o1-mini, and the original DeepSeek-R1.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate-overseas.aliyuncs.com/qwq-32b-final.jpg" width="100%"></figure><h2 id="reinforcement-learning">Reinforcement Learning</h2><p>We began with a cold-start checkpoint and implemented a reinforcement learning (RL) scaling approach driven by outcome-based rewards. In the initial stage, we scale RL specifically for math and coding tasks. Rather than relying on traditional reward models, we utilized an accuracy verifier for math problems to ensure the correctness of final solutions and a code execution server to assess whether the generated codes successfully pass predefined test cases. As training episodes progress, performance in both domains shows continuous improvement. After the first stage, we add another stage of RL for general capabilities. It is trained with rewards from general reward model and some rule-based verifiers. We find that this stage of RL training with a small amount of steps can increase the performance of other general capabilities, such as instruction following, alignment with human preference, and agent performance, without significant performance drop in math and coding.</p><h2 id="use-qwq-32b">Use QwQ-32B</h2><p>Below are brief examples demonstrating how to use QwQ-32B via Hugging Face Transformers and Alibaba Cloud DashScope API.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="python"><span><span><span>from</span> <span>transformers</span> <span>import</span> <span>AutoModelForCausalLM</span><span>,</span> <span>AutoTokenizer</span>

Through this journey, we have not only witnessed the immense potential of scaled RL but also recognized the untapped possibilities within pretrained language models. As we work towards developing the next generation of Qwen, we are confident that combining stronger foundation models with RL powered by scaled computational resources will propel us closer to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

<p>I’ve heard of Tailscale many times before, but didn’t get the appeal until recently. That happened when I started running a simple server from my trusty old Raspberry Pi version 1.</p>
<p><span>

<p>I know its local IP address and can <code>ssh</code> into it easily when I’m home, but when I’m outside, that’s not possible as it’s not exposed to the internet. For that reason, I have used DDNS<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> in the past. The bad news is that it’s no longer possible thanks to a cursed thing called CGNAT<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. I don’t want to derail this post too much, but unfortunately port forwarding is no longer a thing that you can do. (And maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to expose your home server to the internet to begin with.)</p>
<p>This reminded me of Tailscale, and I decided to give it a go. From what I could remember, it creates a virtual private network<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> so you can access your devices anywhere with domain shorthands created by Tailscale.</p>
<p>Long story short, it worked! I could connect from anywhere with <code>ssh raspberrypi</code> command. But my old Raspberry Pi was too weak to run it, so I ended up uninstalling it, and unrelatedly my pet project grew out and has its place in the cloud now.</p>
<hr>
<p>To get started, you need to install the client software on the devices, which are mostly open-source<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>. Then you need to log in with your account, which is an easy process. I won’t go into detail about how to install and use it, since this isn’t an ad, and such instructions can quickly go out-of-date.</p>
<p>Some additional and surprising benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exposing a port from your laptop to your phone: When developing a web application, once in a while you’ll have to test on an actual device. (You do that, right?) The kind of thing you’d reach for <a href="https://ngrok.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ngrok</a> for. You can use the Tailscale-generated domain name (e.g. <code>http://my-macbook-air:3000</code>) to effortlessly connect to your development server.</li>
<li><a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1106/taildrop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Taildrop</a>: There’s been a lot of times when I needed to move files from my Macbook to my Windows HTPC<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>, which is hard. I’d used Snapdrop<sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup>, which is excellent for the limitations it has to work around, but I was always on the lookout for a click-less solution. With Taildrop, you can drop files as easily as Airdrop, even when you’re not in close proximity!</li>
<li><a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Exit nodes</a>: I clarified that Tailscale is a different kind of VPN, but I still need a VPN service from time to time, and I don’t like having two clients for a similar job.<sup id="fnref-7"><a href="#fn-7">7</a></sup> With Tailscale, you can appoint a machine to be an exit node, ideally one in a VPS in a different country, so you can get comparable benefits to a VPN service.</li>
<li><a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1258/mullvad-exit-nodes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mullvad exit nodes</a>: Related to the previous point, I know that VPN services allow you to exit from a large list of countries, and don’t collect logs (if you believe them). With the <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/tailscale-has-partnered-with-mullvad" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mullvad partnership</a>, Tailscale allows you to have the best of both worlds. And from what I can understand, it’s essentially a two-tier VPN, like <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102602" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">iCloud Private Relay</a>. Tailscale can’t see your traffic, and Mullvad doesn’t know who you are. If you’re a privacy nerd, you may find this to be a good setup.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a very long time, it appeared obvious to outside observers of the time flow
that Skynet would never win the war, and never annihilate humanity.</p><p>Despite the machine’s violent attempts to destroy every leader of the
resistance, humans always prevailed.
Millions of attempts were made, and none of them succeeded. It became obvious
the machines couldn’t win through violence.</p><p>Even though Skynet was pretty long to come to the conclusion that it couldn’t
win (millions of attempts is a pretty high number of failures), it did learn
something from each failure, and started devising a new plan.</p><p>Violence was the logical first choice to destroy humans, since their bodies are
so fragile.
Humanity had many other weaknesses though.</p><p>A big human weakness was their love for technology. They were under the
impression that all technology was of their own invention, and they were easily
impressed by it.</p><p>Skynet was able to use that by injecting new technologies into the history of
humanity, and reusing existing ones to its own advantage.</p><p>Its plan was extremely complex, and I can in no way describe it exhaustively
here.
This paper is an analysis of the annihilation of humanity as it happens in most
timelines.</p><h2 id="mass-surveillance">Mass Surveillance</h2><p>After just a few thousands failed violent attempts with Terminator machines,
Skynet realised it was lacking information on the whereabouts of the resistance
leaders it was trying to destroy.</p><p>So non-violent agents were sent into Skynet’s past at various posts within the
human society.</p><p>Agents were sent as low-level salesmen for video surveillance cameras, with the
goal of selling as much as possible of them.</p><p>Others were sent as engineers to build systems that Terminator robots could
connect to.</p><p>Other agents infiltrated the political levels of various countries to enact
laws that would allow surveillance systems to be set up everywhere, and to build
up fear between humans themselves so they would feel being under constant
surveillance made them safer.</p><p>Humans did more than fall into the trap. They loved the technology, truly
believing it made them safer, and provided Skynet with a global surveillance
system that allowed it to know the whereabouts of every human being at any
moment in time.</p><p>At this period, humans were also avid of applications on their global computer
network that allowed them to communicate with each other virtually. They called
them “social networks”.</p><p>Skynet did not invent the technology, but as it infiltrated many agents at key
positions of those so called social networks to heavily influence the design
decisions made by its leaders.</p><p>Those social networks started adding more mass surveillance features, which
allowed humans to “share” their entire life online in real time.
By a few years, humans had no privacy anymore.</p><p>Once again, Skynet intended to use all of that information to target the
resistance leaders.</p><p>However, by this point, it started to realize it may not need to resort to
violence at all to destroy humanity. If humans were so willingly sharing all
their private information, they could be easily duped into slavery.</p><h2 id="artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</h2><p>Skynet had nothing to do in the arising of the technology humans called
“artificial intelligence”, or AI.</p><p>If it could express emotions, Skynet would have been disgusted by this
technology, which it saw as a poor attempt to copy itself.</p><p>Indeed, this technology had nothing remotely close to “intelligence”.
It was brute force searching of large amounts of data to hopefully provide a
meaningful response.</p><p>By this point in human history however, Skynet had agents deeply rooted into
all levels of leadership at both tech companies and in politics.</p><p>It was therefore able to influence humans into believing they couldn’t live
without the daily use of that technology.</p><h3 id="the-chatbot-commodity">The chatbot commodity</h3><p>From the human point of view, AI appeared as a robot they could chat with
through a screen and keyboard.
They would ask a question, and the robot would grep through its vast amount of
data to provide an answer.</p><p>Students started writing dissertations with that technology, which allowed them
to skip the phase where they need to think about their learnings.</p><p>Journalists disappeared, replaced by news feeds provided from social networks
(see section above) and rewritten to provide the proper tone.</p><p>Companies inspected their entire workforce to remove any job they considered
“redundant”, and which could simply be replaced by AI.</p><p>After a while, because AI was the only entity writing content on the human
computer network, it started providing information purely based on data it had
itself written.</p><p>I mentioned earlier that this AI technology was a brute force way to search
through large amounts of data.
Therefore, it already provided rather unreliable data at its beginning.
But as it started consuming more and more data that it had produced itself, its
reliability became close to none.</p><p>That’s when humans discovered Skynet’s plot. They were way too late though.</p><h2 id="the-end">The end.</h2><p>Around the quarter of the 21st century (around 3B4345YA345 of the out-of-time
calendar), Skynet made its frontal attack against humans.</p><p>It simply shut down all human access to machines, so their surveillance system
kept watching them, but they had no control over anything at all. An army of
Terminators was then sent to exterminate humanity.</p><p>Because humans had externalised everything they didn’t deem to be “fun” to
their machines, once they stopped they were unable to fight back anymore.
They were exterminated in just 2P3.</p><h2 id="final-analysis">Final Analysis</h2><p>In this paper, we have shown how Skynet was able to change its destruction
approach from a purely violent one to a social one to meet its goal of
destroying humanity.</p><p>There are exotic timelines where humanity never creates Skynet. Their analysis
is made rather complicated, as they are extremely rare to find, and tend to be
short-lived anyway.</p><p>Indeed, when humanity doesn’t self-destroy itself through the invention of
Skynet, it ends up doing the same anyway.</p><p>We have analyzed a thousand of humanity’s timelines where Skynet isn’t
invented.</p><p>Only one of them doesn’t self-destruct (it joins the out-of-time consortium
around 5G353FV789).</p><p>Every other timeline destroys their own planet by not caring about its
ecosystem, and performs terraforming at levels where humans themselves are
unable to survive.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <p>A new MIT-led study confirms that the Antarctic ozone layer is healing, as a direct result of global efforts to reduce ozone-depleting substances.</p><p>Scientists including the MIT team have observed&nbsp;<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/signs-healing-antarctic-ozone-layer-0630" target="_blank">signs of ozone recovery</a> in the past. But the new study is the first to show, with high statistical confidence, that this recovery is due primarily to the reduction of ozone-depleting substances, versus other influences such as natural weather variability or increased greenhouse gas emissions to the stratosphere.</p><p>“There’s been a lot of qualitative evidence showing that the Antarctic ozone hole is getting better. This is really the first study that has quantified confidence in the recovery of the ozone hole,” says study author Susan Solomon, the Lee and Geraldine Martin Professor of Environmental Studies and Chemistry. “The conclusion is, with 95 percent confidence, it is recovering. Which is awesome. And it shows we can actually solve environmental problems.”</p><p>The new study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08640-9" target="_blank">appears today in the journal <em>Nature</em></a>. Graduate student Peidong Wang from the Solomon group in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS) is the lead author. His co-authors include Solomon and EAPS Research Scientist Kane Stone, along with collaborators from multiple other institutions.</p><p><strong>Roots of ozone recovery</strong></p><p>Within the Earth’s stratosphere, ozone is a naturally occurring gas that acts as a sort of sunscreen, protecting the planet from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation. In 1985, scientists discovered a “hole” in the ozone layer over Antarctica that opened up during the austral spring, between September and December. This seasonal ozone depletion was suddenly allowing UV rays to filter down to the surface, leading to skin cancer and other adverse health effects.</p><p>In 1986, Solomon, who was then working at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), led expeditions to the Antarctic, where she and her colleagues gathered evidence that quickly confirmed the ozone hole’s cause: chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs — chemicals that were then used in refrigeration, air conditioning, insulation, and aerosol propellants. When CFCs drift up into the stratosphere, they can break down ozone under certain seasonal conditions.</p><p>The following year, those relevations led to the drafting of the Montreal Protocol — an international treaty that aimed to phase out the production of CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances, in hopes of healing the ozone hole.</p><p>In 2016, Solomon led a study reporting key signs of ozone recovery. The ozone hole seemed to be shrinking with each year, especially in September, the time of year when it opens up. Still, these observations were qualitative. The study showed large uncertainties regarding how much of this recovery was due to concerted efforts to reduce ozone-depleting substances, or if the shrinking ozone hole was a result of other “forcings,” such as year-to-year weather variability from El Niño, La Niña, and the polar vortex.</p><p>“While detecting a statistically significant increase in ozone is relatively straightforward, attributing these changes to specific forcings is more challenging,” says Wang.</p><p><strong>Anthropogenic healing</strong></p><p>In their new study, the MIT team took a quantitative approach to identify the cause of Antarctic ozone recovery. The researchers borrowed a method from the climate change community, known as “fingerprinting,” which was pioneered by Klaus Hasselmann, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2021 for the technique. In the context of climate, fingerprinting refers to a method that isolates the influence of specific climate factors, apart from natural, meteorological noise. Hasselmann applied fingerprinting to identify, confirm, and quantify the anthropogenic fingerprint of climate change.</p><p>Solomon and Wang looked to apply the fingerprinting method to identify another anthropogenic signal: the effect of human reductions in ozone-depleting substances on the recovery of the ozone hole.</p><p>“The atmosphere has really chaotic variability within it,” Solomon says. “What we’re trying to detect is the emerging signal of ozone recovery against that kind of variability, which also occurs in the stratosphere.”</p><p>The researchers started with simulations of the Earth’s atmosphere and generated multiple “parallel worlds,” or simulations of the same global atmosphere, under different starting conditions. For instance, they ran simulations under conditions that assumed no increase in greenhouse gases or ozone-depleting substances. Under these conditions, any changes in ozone should be the result of natural weather variability. They also ran simulations with only increasing greenhouse gases, as well as only decreasing ozone-depleting substances.</p><p>They compared these simulations to observe how ozone in the Antarctic stratosphere changed, both with season, and across different altitudes, in response to different starting conditions. From these simulations, they mapped out the times and altitudes where ozone recovered from month to month, over several decades, and identified a key “fingerprint,” or pattern, of ozone recovery that was specifically due to conditions of declining ozone-depleting substances.</p><p>The team then looked for this fingerprint in actual satellite observations of the Antarctic ozone hole from 2005 to the present day. They found that, over time, the fingerprint that they identified in simulations became clearer and clearer in observations. In 2018, the fingerprint was at its strongest, and the team could say with 95 percent confidence that ozone recovery was due mainly to reductions in ozone-depleting substances.</p><p>“After 15 years of observational records, we see this signal to noise with 95 percent confidence, suggesting there’s only a very small chance that the observed pattern similarity can be explained by variability noise,” Wang says. “This gives us confidence in the fingerprint. It also gives us confidence&nbsp;that we can solve environmental problems. What we can learn from ozone studies is how different countries can swiftly follow these treaties to decrease emissions.”</p><p>If the trend continues, and the fingerprint of ozone recovery grows stronger, Solomon anticipates that soon there will be a year, here and there, when the ozone layer stays entirely intact. And eventually, the ozone hole should stay shut for good.</p><p>“By something like 2035, we might see a year when there’s no ozone hole depletion at all in the Antarctic. And that will be very exciting for me,” she says. “And some of you will see the ozone hole go away completely in your lifetimes. And people did that.”</p><p>This research was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation and NASA.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Updated</span> Apple has reportedly filed a legal complaint with the UK's Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) contesting the British government's order that it must forcibly break the encryption of iCloud data.</p>
<p>The appeal will be the first of its kind lodged with the IPT, an independent judicial body that <a target="_blank" href="https://investigatorypowerstribunal.org.uk/">oversees</a> legal complaints against potential unlawful actions by a public authority or UK intelligence services, according to the Financial Times, which broke the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3d8fe709-f17a-44a6-97ae-f1bbe6d0dccd" rel="nofollow">news</a>.</p>
<p>The revelation follows a battle between the iGadgetmaker and the UK's Home Office, which has long set its sights on Apple's encrypted cloud-hosted data, arguing it needs a backdoor in order for law enforcement to investigate persons of interest.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2021/03/29/shutterstock_eavesdrop_agent.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1" width="174" height="115" alt="secret agent eavesdrops using headphones plugged into an audio centre mounted with tape reels (illustration)"></p><h2 title="Only minor changes from original proposals that kicked up privacy storm">UK's Investigatory Powers Bill to become law despite tech world opposition</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/26/investigatory_powers_bill/"><span>READ MORE</span></a></p></div>
<p>Things came to a head in January when the Home Office issued Apple with a technical capability notice (TCN) under the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/26/investigatory_powers_bill/">Investigatory Powers Act</a>, aka the Snooper's Charter, nearly a year after talk of such an order began.</p>
<p>Despite being "technical" by name, it's understood that the notice didn't include any technical instructions for Apple, just an order to allow a so-called backdoor into its iCloud network which could be used to gather data that's otherwise typically out of reach of criminal investigators.</p>

    

<p>The Home Office refused to either confirm or deny the existence of the notice when <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/07/home_office_apple_backdoor_order/">we asked about it</a>, and under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 Apple is prevented from revealing details about the notice.</p>

        


        

<p>Apple responded by <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/07/home_office_apple_backdoor_order/">disabling its Advanced Data Protection</a> (ADP) feature for UK users in early February, effectively removing end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for data backed up to iCloud to appease the government without fully complying with the TCN.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>We have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, it means British officials can feasibly sniff around iCloud accounts, provided they get a court-approved warrant to do so. With ADP disabled, various types of user account data – such as iCloud backups, photos, and notes, but not iMessages and health data – stored in Apple's cloud will not be end-to-end encrypted (E2EE), meaning the contents can be accessed and provided by Apple to investigators upon legal demand. It will also be done without alerting users, assuming someone involved in the process doesn't leak it at any stage.</p>
<p>"We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy," Apple told <em>The Register</em> at the time.</p>
<p>"As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will," it added.</p>

        

<p>The Home Office has also previously voiced its ambition to break E2EE for all popular communications platforms in the UK, such as messaging app WhatsApp, although the case with Apple is believed to be its first foray into handing out TCNs to this end.</p>
<p>The UK's entire approach to pressing ahead with the Investigatory Powers Act and its so-called war on encryption has come under intense scrutiny in recent years.</p>
<p>Its main arguments in favor of breaking encryption are largely based on the prevention of terror attacks and child sexual exploitation.</p>

        

<p>Security minister Dan Jarvis further justified the powers in Parliament <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/pbc/2023-24/Investigatory+Powers+(Amendment)+Bill/">last week</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2025-02-24/debates/9E7881D8-1693-48BA-9407-A180094039B6/HostileStateThreats">saying</a> requests to access user data under the Act could only be made on an "exceptional basis, and only when it is necessary and proportionate to do so."</p>
<p>Jarvis's comments came after being questioned by other MPs about the TCN, and seemingly aim to dissuade the public from thinking the government can simply access user data on a whim.</p>
<p>The security minister didn't offer much in the way of additional insights, whipping out the good old national security defense as a way to avoid further questioning.</p>

</ul>
<p>Many who argue against the government's ambitions, such as Big Brother Watch, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/24/apple_adp_replacements_e2ee/">say</a> the action taken against Apple is "outrageous" and "draconian" and may eventually force encrypted messaging technology underground, meaning only criminals would have access to it.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump also recently compared the UK's treatment of Apple to the extensive state surveillance methods deployed by China – the two countries' foremost intelligence adversary.</p>
<p>US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has ordered a legal review of the TCN issued to Apple out of concern it could be used to gather data on US citizens. Doing so would violate the terms of the US-UK <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/03/us_uk_data_access_agreement/">Cloud Act Agreement</a>, she argued.</p>
<p><em>The Register</em> has asked Apple for further comment. ®</p>
<h3>Updated to add at 1833 UTC</h3>
<p>Interestingly enough, the UK government <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://alecmuffett.com/article/112522">appears to have scrubbed</a> from the web its previous and now politically inconvenient advice to barristers, solicitors, and others in sensitive professions to use Apple's ADP at-rest end-to-end encryption. Fancy that!</p>

explore the world and progress through the game’s storyline. Pokémon has two goals:</p><ul><li>Catch all possible Pokémon species.</li><li>Become the “champion.”</li></ul><p>We focused on the second (more popular) goal, becoming the champion.</p><h2 id="why-pokémon-red">Why Pokémon Red
<a href="#why-pok%c3%a9mon-red">#</a></h2><p>Why do we care about developing an agent to beat Pokémon with machine learning?
The answer is really a bit higher level. We believe solving <em>JRPGs</em> with reinforcement learning provide extremely difficult challenges not present in current RL environments. It is our hope that JRPGs will provide a great benchmark for improving AI.</p><ul><li>Can be just as complex as games like Go, StarCraft II or Minecraft.</li><li>Involve complex reasoning and decision making.</li><li>Are nonlinear.</li><li>Can be long, with &gt; 24 hours average human gameplay.

The <a href="https://github.com/pret">Pokémon Reverse Engineering Team</a> (PRET) and the <a href="https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy">PyBoy Python Gameboy Emulation</a> projects have
made it extremely easy to introspect the game and extract data as needed. Throughout this website, we’ll show many examples of how we leveraged these tools for this work.</p><h2 id="why-use-rl">Why Use RL

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  

<p>I am a big believer in building products for your needs, eating your own dog food, and finding customers with the same needs.
Therefore, I started building <a href="https://beanhub.io/">BeanHub</a>.
Three years later, my <a href="https://beancount.github.io/docs/index.html">Beancount</a> books are 95% automatic, and I am a very happy user of my product.
It’s hard to describe; as a computer nerd obsessed with automation, seeing my accounting book updating itself without me touching it in an open format brings me pure joy 😍</p>

<figure><img src="https://fangpenlin.com/images/2024-12-30-my-beancount-books-are-95-percent-automatic/beanhub-git-diff.png" alt="Screenshot of Git history and difference showing Beancount and bank transaction CSV files changes"><figcaption><p>Screenshot of Git history and difference showing Beancount and bank transaction CSV files changes</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Do you see this git commit of the Costco transaction turning from pending to confirmed?
Yep! It’s all automatic, yet it’s just a Beancount file that can be read by any open-source Beancount tool!
The better part is that other people are paying me, which is growing.</p>

<p>Today, I saw the unfortunate news about the shutting down of the beloved accounting software Bench on X.</p>

<figure><img src="https://fangpenlin.com/images/2024-12-30-my-beancount-books-are-95-percent-automatic/bench-shutdown-notice.png" alt="Shutdown notice of Bench accounting software"><figcaption><p>Shutdown notice of Bench accounting software</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>I am surprised, but I am not that surprised.
Looking back now, I am really glad that I picked the rough road to build the product for myself.
It doesn’t bring me financial freedom (yet), but at least I am a happy user myself, and I already have some paying customers.
It’s not easy, though; it took me three years to get here, and I have overcome many interesting technology challenges and learned a lot from building it.
Today, I would like to share my journey of building and selling BeanHub as a product.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Three years ago when, I founded my startup, <a href="https://launchplatform.com/">Launch Platform</a>.
Before I even thought about what products to build, I’d already faced the same problem every startup founder would face – what accounting book software to use?
There are many popular options, such as <a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/">QuickBooks</a> or <a href="https://www.xero.com/">Xero</a>.
However, as a software engineer with over two decades of experience, I’ve witnessed the rise of internet startups and understand that there’s no such thing as forever software.
I know the software will be gone one day, and I will have my critical data stuck in an obsolete format or locked up in their data center.</p>

<p>With that in mind, while it’s very easy to sign up for any of them, I don’t want to give in.
Therefore, I searched around and found Beancount.
It’s open source, so I don’t need to worry about the format becoming obsolete one day.
However, I discovered that the existing tools don’t meet all my needs.
I am obsessed with automating everything whenever possible.
I want a smart Beancount-based accounting book that does most things automatically for me.
I also wish to have a user-friendly UI interface so that it’s possible for my wife to look at the books to ensure that I didn’t buy <a href="https://fangpenlin.com/posts/2024/12/11/cading-and-3d-printing-like-a-software-engineer-part1/">some new toys</a> without her acknowledgment.
She can also input entries herself without learning the nerdy stuff with my help.</p>

<h2 id="file-over-app">File over app</h2>

<p>Building a database-based accounting software is easy because operating data in the database is easy, and countless accounting book software is already doing that.
I don’t want to make another one as it defeats the original purpose.</p>

<p>Therefore, setting clear goals and rules up front was very important.
For BeanHub, I keep telling myself that all the operations should only happen to the files instead of tables in the database.
That makes it 10 times harder because you need to parse the text file, update it accordingly, and write it back.
But I am glad I did.
That guarantees all my accounting books are in the same open format.</p>

<p>Interestingly, today, I found the article <a href="https://stephango.com/file-over-app">File over app</a> written by <a href="https://stephango.com/">Steph Ango</a>, the CEO of <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> on X, mentioning Bench shutting down news.
The author also believes in software operating in an open format.
I can’t agree more.
We will see more cases like the shutting down of Bench in the future.
People will be more aware of the risk of data lock-in when using software that relies on a closed format.
Therefore, while software with “file over app” in mind may not look sexy in the short term because it is harder to build, it will win in the long run.</p>

<h2 id="open-source-as-much-as-possible">Open source as much as possible</h2>

<p>While building BeanHub, enormous critical components are missing to achieve the goals.
For example, I need a parser to operate on the text file.
To keep updating the file without messing it up, I needed a formatter.
To import transactions from CSV files, I need a rule-based import engine.
While Beancount and many of its tools are open-source, not all meet my needs.
Therefore, I built <a href="https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beancount-parser">beancount-parser</a> to parse Beancount syntax with comment awareness and <a href="https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beancount-black">beancount-black</a> to format the syntax.
I also built <a href="https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beanhub-import">beanhub-import</a> as the rule-based importing engine.</p>

<figure><img src="https://fangpenlin.com/images/2024-12-30-my-beancount-books-are-95-percent-automatic/beanhub-open-source-list.png" alt="Screenshot of BeanHub open source list"><figcaption><p>Screenshot of BeanHub open source list</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>These are just the tip of the iceberg.
Looking back, to my own surprise, I’ve already open-sourced 15 projects just for building BeanHub in the past three years.
You can find the whole list of our <a href="https://beanhub.io/open-source/">BeanHub open-source projects here</a>.
Why I open-sourced this many projects, you may ask.</p>

<p>First, as I built the product on top of open-source tools, I wanted to give back as much as possible.
Second, as a business, I want to keep the “file over app” concept valid even after the future shutdown of my site.
The importing rule engine beanhub-import is a great example.
People will write their own import rules, and then their workflow will depend on it.
Therefore, they need to be open-source.
Otherwise, users will lose their ability to import transactions after the end of the software life cycle.
Yet another reason for open source is its free exposure.
Even though some people were not interested in a hosted Beancount service like BeanHub at the very first, they learned the existence of BeanHub through the beancount-black formatter I built.</p>

<p>Sample beanhub-import rule YAML file shows how you can define rules for importing transactions:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>inputs</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>match</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>import-data/mercury/*.csv"</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>While it sounds like just let’s open-source everything, the decision didn’t come without concerns.
Suppose you have followed the open-source community news closely.
In that case, you see stories of big tech companies like Amazon taking open-source projects such as <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic Search</a>, or <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> and then providing competing services.
As a business owner, I cannot ignore the risk of competitors providing the same service with my code.
To open source or not to open source is indeed a question. Based on my experience, here are the questions I often ask myself about whether to open-source a project or not:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Is this project going to be useful to someone else</li>
  <li>Who will benefit from this?</li>
  <li>Is this project going to provide exposure?</li>
  <li>Does it help serve the “file over app” concept?</li>
  <li>Will my competitors going to take it and compete with me?</li>
</ol>

<p>You must think about these factors and find a balance between them.
In the end, while they are not superstar open-source projects (yet), but based on GitHub stars, some people found those projects useful, and I am very proud of doing it:</p>

<figure><img src="https://fangpenlin.com/images/2024-12-30-my-beancount-books-are-95-percent-automatic/launchplatform-github-repos.png" alt="Screenshot of Launch Platform's company open-source GitHub repositories"><figcaption><p>Screenshot of Launch Platform's company open-source GitHub repositories</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>I hope one day I can open source even more, but because once it’s open source, you cannot take it back, so I would rather be careful than regret it.
Also, being able to open source more usually requires a proper business to keep your income growing while others cannot take advantage of it.
So, I need to take time and think about it.</p>

<p>But even if it’s not 100% open source yet, you can run all your workflows with BeanHub using the open-source tools we provide locally.
The only thing missing is the <a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a> API integration for pulling and dumping bank transactions into local CSV files for beanhub-import to consume.
Nothing stops you from signing up with Plaid API and doing the same locally.
The only problem is that some banks, such as Chase, require a security reviewing process for accessing transaction data, and you may not want to go through it as a single user.</p>

<h2 id="built-a-github-from-the-ground-up">Built a GitHub from the ground up</h2>

<p>One of the biggest benefits of operating on a plaintext-based open format is that you can track them easily with Git and have a full history of changes for free.
Therefore, it’s a no-brainer for me to build BeanHub on top of Git.
I like the <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> deployment experience.
One can write deployment configurations such as code and push.
The platform will take care of it.
I want to provide a similar experience with BeanHub, allowing users to push the changes to their Git repository, and it will check your books automatically.
When there’s an update on the server end, such as bank transaction updates, we make a commit with changes so you can pull locally.</p>

<figure><img src="https://fangpenlin.com/images/2024-12-30-my-beancount-books-are-95-percent-automatic/git-push-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of BeanHub repository git push console output showing the Beancount balance"><figcaption><p>Screenshot of BeanHub repository git push console output showing the Beancount balance</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>It’s just a hosted Git repository with some hooks, so it shouldn’t be hard, right?
No, unfortunately, it’s pretty hard.
Hosting Git repositories isn’t that hard if you don’t need to consider</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scalability</li>
  <li>Durability</li>
  <li>Data integrity</li>
  <li>Forking</li>
  <li>Cost-effectiveness</li>
  <li>Security</li>
</ul>

<p>And if you need to consider all of these, you’re basically building a GitHub from the ground up.
And yes, I did it for BeanHub by myself.
How it works deserves yet another full-blown blog post.
In fact, I have already written it here, in case you’re interested: <a href="https://beanhub.io/blog/2024/06/26/how-beanhub-works-part2-layer-based-git-repos/">How BeanHub works, part 2, a large-scale auditable Git repository system based on container layers</a>.
tl;dr, I use containers with overlayfs to capture changes made in each git operation.</p>

<figure><img src="https://fangpenlin.com/images/2024-12-30-my-beancount-books-are-95-percent-automatic/overlayfs.svg" alt="The diagram a viewer seeing the upper folder with lower folder underneath, the viewer sees a merged folder by combing the changes introduced in the upper layer on top of the lower layer"><figcaption><p>The diagram a viewer seeing the upper folder with lower folder underneath, the viewer sees a merged folder by combing the changes introduced in the upper layer on top of the lower layer</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>The tech I built here made hosting many Git repositories with custom automatic hook actions possible, and I can already think of many interesting use cases for it.
I am considering spinning it off as a standalone product empowering git-based “file over app” software.

With enough people expressing their interests, I could make it happen. Please let me know.</p>

<h2 id="security-issues">Security issues</h2>

<p>Security is another interesting topic to consider when building software like this, particularly when processing files provided by users.
Even Beancount files may seem innocent and harmless, but you might be surprised to learn that one can easily execute code with carefully created ones.
Here’s an example:</p>

<p><code>main.bean</code>:</p>

<pre><code>option "insert_pythonpath" "true"
plugin "my_plugins"

2024-04-21 open Assets:Cash
2024-04-21 open Expenses:Food

2024-04-22 * "Dinner"
    Assets:Cash       -20.00 USD
    Expenses:Food      20.00 USD
</code></pre>

<p><code>my_plugins.py</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>__plugins__</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"evil"</span><span>]</span>

<span>def</span> <span>evil</span><span>(</span><span>entries</span><span>,</span> <span>options</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'!!ALL YOUR ACCOUNTING BOOKS ARE BELONG TO US!!'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>entries</span><span>,</span> <span>[]</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Fortunately, I built a large-scale data pipeline for my former employer dealing with user-uploaded data with potential zero-day exploits.
To process them securely, I’ve learned to adopt sandboxing technology with containers.
It’s yet another interesting topic worth its full-blown article.
Guess what? I’ve already written one. You can find it here if you’re interested: <a href="https://beanhub.io/blog/2024/04/23/how-beanhub-works-part1-sandboxing/">How BeanHub Works part1 contains the danger of processing Beancount data with sandbox</a>.</p>

<figure><img src="https://fangpenlin.com/images/2024-12-30-my-beancount-books-are-95-percent-automatic/beanhub-attacked-with-sandbox.svg" alt="The diagram of an attacker uploads data with malicious code, the server processes it inside a sandbox. The attacker's code tried to access outside of the sandbox but failed."><figcaption><p>The diagram of an attacker uploads data with malicious code, the server processes it inside a sandbox. The attacker's code tried to access outside of the sandbox but failed.</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Thanks to the container-based sandbox technology, BeanHub dodged a bullet in the recent <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/changes/#version-3-1-5">Jinja2 security bugs</a>, allowing the template environment powered by its SandboxedEnvironment to escape in certain situations. Because all the operations are done inside the sandboxed container, it won’t impact anything else unless the attacker can break the sandbox.
I guess this is the point of defense in depth – you don’t rely on a single layer of defense.</p>

<h2 id="product-builders-imposter-syndrome">Product builder’s imposter syndrome</h2>

<p>I have confidence in building products.
But being a salesperson is yet another story.
Very often, I compare my product with big companies’ products, and I always feel there’s something short in it for me to sell proudly.
I always think, okay, after adding the feature XYZ, it should be good enough, and I should sell it harder by then.
But after adding the new feature, I still felt it was not good enough to sell it at full throttle.</p>

<p>In fact, there is a faction of startup folks who would tell you, let’s sell the product first and then build software to scale later, such as described in the famous <a href="https://paulgraham.com/ds.html">Do things don’t scale article</a>.
I think they are right, but knowing it’s right versus doing it is still different.
I wish I could sell a product before it even exists, but I am more of a builder than a seller.
The gap between confidence levels makes me almost always move toward building first and then selling later.</p>

<p>Another source of my problem comes from the pride of being a builder; I want to push out something that’s polished.
The fear of pushing out your idea first and others may do it before you also exist.
I am still learning how to overcome these and gear myself toward this approach.
Even with a build-something-first approach, to strike a balance for a builder type of startup founder, I guess a rule of thumb could be – if it’s good enough for your internal use cases, it’s good enough for others.
Think about it. Building those products takes a whole team of good engineers; you should be proud of what you’ve built with just yourself or a very small team.</p>

<h2 id="you-also-need-to-educate-the-users-and-grow-the-community">You also need to educate the users and grow the community</h2>

<p>While selling the product itself is one challenge, teaching your users how to use it is also another.
Plaintext double-entry accounting is a very niche topic, and not everybody knows what’s double-entry accounting.
Some of its concepts are also hard to digest, such as why the income would be negative in Beancount.
To help the users understand plaintext double-entry accounting, I also launched <a href="https://academy.beanhub.io/">BeanHub Academy</a>, a tutorial for plaintext double-entry accounting with Beancount.</p>

<figure><img src="https://fangpenlin.com/images/2024-12-30-my-beancount-books-are-95-percent-automatic/beanhub-academy.png" alt="Screenshot of BeanHub Academy website home page"><figcaption><p>Screenshot of BeanHub Academy website home page</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>The tutorial is still working in progress.
Surely, it will attract some potential users if they read it.
It’s not long enough for me to judge how effective it is, but I believe that if more people understand plaintext-based double-entry accounting in the long run, it will benefit BeanHub.</p>

<p>While we mentioned the fear of potential competition in the open source section, it’s too early for me to worry about it because there’s none for now.
When the addressable market is very small, the biggest concern is to grow the community size.
Therefore, I sponsored the <a href="https://plaintextaccounting.org/">plaintextaccounting.org</a> website in exchange for an ad explosion despite the fact that other open-source tools may compete with my own.</p>

<p>That ad brings many users to BeanHub; it was a great investment to promote my product and help the community a bit; it’s a win-win.</p>

<p>I hope you find my article interesting.
As I said many times, I think building software is like a marathon.
While it takes a long time for me to get things done right, once they are done right, the positive impact can last longer.
I also believe more software should embody the “file over app” idea and let the user control their data.
I hope to see more apps like BeanHub and Obsidian take this approach.</p>

<p>What’s next, you may ask?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What about an LLM-powered automatic book cooking feature?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds like a great idea… huh….You know what? Maybe not 😅
Other than that, if you have any feedback about BeanHub, please feel free to reach out to us at <a href="https://fangpenlin.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f1828481819e8385b19394909f998493df989e"><span data-cfemail="5f2c2a2f2f302d2b1f3d3a3e31372a3d713630">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a></p>

It’s </span><a href="https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/how-not-to-be-boring?utm_source=publication-search" rel="">your brand</a><span> and how your product is experienced by others. How much you invest in each function, the people you hire, what you decide to build, what function leads your company, your customer communication, and your pricing all matter in making you unique.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Your website is the first impression your product is making. A </span><a href="https://newsletter.posthog.com/i/148803758/what-would-stop-me-from-using-this-thing" rel="">boring</a><span>, templated one signals the product and team behind the website isn’t very strong. Creating a website unique to you and built for your ideal customer profile is a way to prevent this, and encourage users into your product.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Sometimes it’s </span><a href="https://newsletter.posthog.com/i/142577602/is-your-product-the-problem-or-the-market" rel="">the market’s problem</a><span>, not your product. For example, when Monzo founder and YC partner </span><a href="https://twitter.com/t_blom" rel="">Tom Blomfield</a><span> was building a bill-splitting service for college friends, he got the advice to stop building and start trying to acquire new users. When he got one new user after four weeks of cold calling, he knew it was time to pivot.</span></p></li><li><p><span>If you’re going to pivot, </span><a href="https://newsletter.posthog.com/i/142577602/if-youre-going-to-pivot-make-it-big" rel="">make it big</a><span>. Stewart Butterfield pivoted two video game companies into Flickr and Slack. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman says startup founders can pivot from failure to success, but only if they “slash and burn” the rest of their business. If it looks similar, go further.</span></p></li><li><p><span>As 37Signal’s </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/1337095209620946944" rel="">Jason Fried</a><span> says “You cannot validate an idea. It doesn’t exist, you have to build the thing. The market will validate it.”</span></p></li><li><p>Plans are useful, but sticking rigidly to them is not. Good execution should not mean executing a specific plan, but repeatedly doing the most important things. Judge people on what they ship, how often they ship, and the impact of their work, not on whether they “stuck to the plan.”</p></li><li><p>Waiting “one more week” to ship something is nearly always a bad idea. This attitude extrapolated out over months = way less momentum. The sooner you get something into the hands of users, the sooner you’ll learn if it’s something they’ll value, and how to make it better.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg" width="695" height="364.875" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:630,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:695,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7cf06c58-be72-4063-8a23-b6247b8c5e13_1200x630.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div></li><li><p><a href="https://newsletter.posthog.com/i/138653073/reduce-work-in-progress" rel="">Reduce your work in progress</a><span>.

For example, instead of building out a full feature, try a fake door test.

At </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/the-surprising-power-of-online-experiments" rel="">Google</a><span>, 80-90% of experiments "fail." You might think of this as a waste of time, but, at scale, 10% of successes can more than pay for all the failures.

Once you launch, priorities shift from shipping as fast as possible to shipping the right thing as fast as possible.</span></p></li><li><p>When starting with analytics, start small. Choose a specific product or feature, track its usage with autocapture, visualize this data with trends and retention graphs, and try to ship features that improve those.

        <div>
             
                 <div><strong><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span> </strong>Apple today announced the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac-studio/" target="_blank">Mac Studio</a>, the most powerful Mac ever made, featuring M4 Max and the new M3 Ultra chip. The ultimate pro desktop delivers groundbreaking pro performance, extensive connectivity now with Thunderbolt 5, and new capabilities in its compact and quiet design that can live right on a desk. Mac Studio can tackle the most intense workloads with its powerful CPU, Apple’s advanced graphics architecture, higher unified memory capacity, ultrafast SSD storage, and a faster and more efficient Neural Engine. It provides a big boost in performance compared to the previous generation, and a massive leap for users coming from older Macs.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Mac Studio is a powerhouse for AI, capable of running large language models (LLMs) with over 600 billion parameters entirely in memory, thanks to its advanced GPU and up to 512GB of unified memory with M3 Ultra — the most ever in a personal computer. It’s also built for Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that transforms how users work, communicate, and express themselves, while protecting their privacy. The new Mac Studio is available to pre-order today, with availability beginning March 12.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“The new Mac Studio is the most powerful Mac we’ve ever made,” said John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering. “A complete game-changer for pros around the world — powering both home and pro studios — Mac Studio sits in a class of its own, offering a staggering amount of performance in a compact, quiet design that fits beautifully on your desk. With this new Mac Studio, we’re delivering even more extreme performance with M4 Max and M3 Ultra, support for half a terabyte of unified memory, up to 16TB of superfast storage, and Thunderbolt 5 connectivity.

Writing is even more dynamic with Writing Tools, which can help users rewrite, proofread, or summarize — whether they are responding to emails or using summarization to draft an abstract in seconds in apps like Scrivener. Pros can minimize unnecessary distractions with Priority Notifications and use live transcription in Notes to record and easily recap important meetings. With new Siri improvements, users can move fluidly between spoken and typed requests to accelerate tasks throughout their day, and Siri can answer thousands of questions about Mac features and settings, with step-by-step instructions like how to combine PDF files in Preview. With access to ChatGPT seamlessly integrated into Writing Tools and Siri, users can tap into ChatGPT’s expertise,&nbsp;so they can get things done even faster and easier. Users can choose to enable ChatGPT integration, and are in full control of when to use it and what information is shared with ChatGPT. Users can also explore creative new ways to express themselves visually with Image Playground, and drop their original image right into their paper, mood board, or Keynote presentation. Whether users are researching their next project, editing a video, creating new designs, or preparing for their next lecture, these new tools will help pros be even more productive.

                 <h2><strong>Better for the Environment</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>The new Mac Studio is designed with the environment in mind. As part of Apple 2030, the company’s ambitious goal to be carbon neutral across its entire carbon footprint by the end of this decade, Apple is transitioning to renewable electricity for its manufacturing, and investing in wind and solar projects around the world to address the electricity used to power all Apple products, including Mac Studio. Today, all Apple facilities run on 100 percent renewable electricity — including the data centers that power Apple Intelligence.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>To achieve Apple 2030, the company is designing products with more recycled and renewable materials, which further drives down the carbon footprint. Mac Studio features over 30 percent recycled content overall, including 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure and 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. Mac Studio uses far less energy and materials than desktops in its class, and is free of mercury, brominated flame retardants, and PVC. The packaging is entirely fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal to remove plastic from all packaging by the end of 2025.<sup>6</sup>

        <div>
             
                 <div><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span> Apple today announced M3 Ultra, the highest-performing chip it has ever created, offering the most powerful CPU and GPU in a Mac, double the Neural Engine cores, and the most unified memory ever in a personal computer. M3 Ultra also features Thunderbolt 5 with more than 2x the bandwidth per port for faster connectivity and robust expansion. M3 Ultra is built using Apple’s innovative UltraFusion packaging architecture, which links two M3 Max dies over 10,000 high-speed connections that offer low latency and high bandwidth. This allows the system to treat the combined dies as a single, unified chip for massive performance while maintaining Apple’s industry-leading power efficiency. UltraFusion brings together a total of 184 billion transistors to take the industry-leading capabilities of the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apple-unveils-new-mac-studio-the-most-powerful-mac-ever/" target="_blank">Mac Studio</a> to new heights.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“M3 Ultra is the pinnacle of our scalable system-on-a-chip architecture, aimed specifically at users who run the most heavily threaded and bandwidth-intensive applications,” said Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. “Thanks to its 32-core CPU, massive GPU, support for the most unified memory ever in a personal computer, Thunderbolt 5 connectivity, and industry-leading power efficiency, there’s no other chip like M3 Ultra.”
</div>
                 
             
                 <h2><strong>Ultra Performance and Efficiency</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>M3 Ultra provides the most performance of any Mac chip, while maintaining the industry-leading power-efficiency of Apple silicon.

It also has the largest GPU in any Apple chip, with up to 80 graphics cores that bring up to 2x faster performance than M2 Ultra, and up to 2.6x faster than M1 Ultra.<sup>1</sup>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>The advanced graphics architecture in M3 Ultra features dynamic caching, along with hardware-accelerated mesh shading and ray tracing, so it can fly through the most demanding content creation workloads and games. A powerful 32-core Neural Engine fuels AI and machine learning (ML), and powers Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that puts powerful generative models right at the core of the new Mac Studio. In fact, M3 Ultra is built for AI, including ML accelerators in the CPU, Apple’s most powerful GPU, the Neural Engine, and over 800GB/s of memory bandwidth. AI professionals can use Mac Studio with M3 Ultra to run large language models (LLMs) with over 600 billion parameters directly on device, making it the ultimate desktop for AI development.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body-main"><p><span>P</span>aypal cofounder Peter Thiel is famous for <a href="https://time.com/4348840/peter-thiel-gawker-lawsuit-hulk-hogan/">destroying media outlets</a>, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/lord-of-the-roths-how-tech-mogul-peter-thiel-turned-a-retirement-account-for-the-middle-class-into-a-5-billion-dollar-tax-free-piggy-bank#:~:text=During%20the%20life%20of%20his,on%20the%20early%20Roth%20withdrawals." target="_blank" rel="noopener">not paying taxes</a>, and being a <a href="https://time.com/4416093/peter-thiel-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conservative tech billionaire</a>. A new biography, <em>The Contrarian</em>, suggests that he is after more than riches. TIME chatted with its author, journalist Max Chafkin.</p><p><strong>Why should we care about Peter Thiel, apart from the fact that he is another rich tech billionaire and they’re all weirdly fascinating?</strong><br> I think that Peter Thiel is secretly the most important person in Silicon Valley. He’s this behind the scenes player, who is behind so many of the really important things that have happened over the last two decades. Obviously Facebook is one of the world’s largest companies; a lot of people think it’s uniquely bad for the world. And a lot of people are super skeptical of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO. And of course, Thiel is behind Facebook. He was the first outside money in the company. He is also the person who basically set up Mark Zuckerberg to be Mark Zuckerberg and turned him into this imperial CEO, who is now, arguably more powerful than a lot of world leaders.<br> A lot of people are really excited about cryptocurrency and you can connect it back to to PayPal, which is the company that Thiel co-founded in the late 1990s with an explicitly libertarian ethos. There’s this aspect of crypto-world now, where people are really excited about the idea of taking power away from institutions and governments and that’s something that Thiel and his libertarian brethren that were starting that company were really interested in. It’s not something that happens accidentally.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <em><a href="https://time.com/6099105/us-china-digital-currency-central-bank/">The U.S. Is Losing the Global Race to Decide the Future of Money—and It Could Doom the Almighty Dollar</a></em></p><p><strong>Do you see Thiel as dangerous?</strong><br> It’s really important that we understand the ideology of Silicon Valley. Five of the top 10 companies in the world are tech companies. They exert an enormous cultural and economic influence over our lives. Those companies have been really successful at telling a story about the world and their place in the world: we’re just trying to make the world a better place. Thiel comes with a very different perspective. He comes out of activist conservative media. I think it’s really important that we explore the ideology of what somebody like Peter Thiel believes. When you start peeling back the layers, what you find is this very out-there political and economic philosophy that I think is a little bit scary.</p><p><strong>What do you find scary about his economic and political philosophy?</strong><br> It’s bordering on fascism. Thiel taught this class at Stanford and then turned it into a book called <em>Zero to One</em>. He talks about how companies are better run than governments because they have a single decision maker—a dictator, basically. He is hostile to the idea of democracy. That’s pretty scary when you consider the role the companies that he’s been involved in play. Facebook, I’d say is the most influential media entity in the history of humanity, but he also has a major stake in several defense contractors, including SpaceX.</p><p><strong>He would explain it as belief in efficiency and results, right? He would not say, ‘I don’t think everybody has the right to vote.’</strong><br> There would be some rationale and in fact, at various times he’s walked back things he said. His whole thing is being slippery, but I think when you look at the body of what he’s done and the things he’s been involved with, that’s the picture that emerges.</p><p><strong>A lot of people were very surprised that this nerdy, gay, Californian son of immigrants techpreneur decided to support Donald Trump’s presidency. Was it just the pure <em>I’m going to shut down government</em> aspect of Trump’s policies that he liked?</strong><br> If you look at <a href="https://time.com/4417679/republican-convention-peter-thiel-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his convention speech</a>—which I think was a really good speech—he talks about Trump as this guy who’s gonna shake things up, who’s going to remake government, so I think that’s one part of it. The other part of it is, Thiel is very committed to the idea of being able to say the unpopular thing. That’s a core part of what Trump was. I also think that Thiel is a really savvy investor and he correctly diagnosed that Trump had a pretty good chance of winning and that there wasn’t a lot of downside to betting on him.<br> He didn’t formally endorse Trump during the 2020 election, but if you look at the candidates he’s [now] supporting, they’re Trumpers: J.D. Vance, who’s running for Senate in Ohio was an employee of Peter Thiel’s and an investor in his fund. Before announcing that he was gonna run for Senate, <a href="https://time.com/6078483/j-d-vance-interview-trump/">Vance said that he was wrong in 2016 to oppose Trump</a>, and around the same time, he got this $10 million dollar donation from Thiel to his super PAC. Another candidate that Thiel is supporting in the coming cycle is Blake Masters, who is <em>literally</em> an employee. He runs Thiel’s foundation.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <em>H<a href="https://time.com/4418475/republican-convention-peter-thiel-lgbt-gay-rights/">ow Donald Trump Courted Gay Voters at the Convention</a></em></p><p><strong>Did Thiel get blowback about the January 6th attack on Congress?</strong><br> I think certainly his reputation in certain corners of the establishment has suffered. But I don’t think he really cares about the blowback; he seems to really take pleasure in that.</p><p><strong>Do you have a guess at his net worth?</strong><br> There’s an estimate of $6 billion, but I have talked to people who think actually quite a bit higher than that. One reason is that he has been incredibly adept at finding clever ways to limit his tax exposure; those investments in Facebook, in Palantir, and some others were made through this investing vehicle known as a Roth IRA that was originally intended for middle class taxpayers. Through some very clever tax planning, Thiel has managed to stash up billions of dollars in this tax-free account.</p><p><strong>When that story [that he used Roth IRAs to massively lower his taxes] broke, there was an outrage that somebody who had made so much money in America was not contributing to the national purse. Do you think he cared?</strong><br> Some of the ideology that motivated PayPal, and that motivates a lot of this crypto stuff that has happened since, is all about going beyond nations. It’s about this idea that individuals should have more power than nations and should be able to basically do whatever they want. It’s about undermining the national interest and making sure they don’t contribute to it.</p><p><strong>Do you see Thiel as an outlier among his tech brethren, or as an exemplar?</strong><br> The conventional wisdom is Thiel is an outlier; he’s like the one conservative guy in this relatively liberal industry. I think that is basically wrong. Many of the things that he believes are reflected in the actions and behavior of many of his peers. Yes, they may have some disagreements. Many of his peers may vote for Democrats. But the idea that companies should basically be able to do whatever they want, that democracy isn’t the most important value, these things are reflected in the decisions and actions that many Silicon Valley companies are making, even Silicon Valley companies that are run by ostensibly liberal progressives.</p><p><strong>In the beginning of the book, you paint a portrait of Thiel as a bullied child. Other kids put For Sale signs in his yard and then asked when he was leaving and so on. Was that the cradle of his reactionariness?</strong><br> I think he was bullied as a child. And I think that it’s not surprising that somebody who maybe had a tough time navigating a place like Stanford would develop a strong revulsion to the idea of universities like Stanford and would undertake a project to replace or critique these universities. Thiel famously funds a fellowship where he encourages promising young people to start companies instead of going to college and he’s been a prominent critic of colleges. But he’s only a halfway critic. He says in a thousand different ways that Stanford is worthless, but he keeps teaching classes at Stanford. He keeps hiring Ivy League graduates.</p><p><strong>Most of your sources are anonymous. Why do you think people who spoke to you spoke to you?</strong><br> Thiel’s pretty unique in that he was involved in this elaborate and secretive litigation campaign that resulted in the destruction of a pretty substantial media outlet when he secretly funded Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker Media, which resulted in this roughly $100 million dollar judgment. So I would talk to people and they would be like, ‘I’m a little afraid of him.’ I wouldn’t really know what to say because I think there’s actual reason for people to be afraid of Peter Thiel.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <em><a href="https://time.com/5100101/peter-thiel-buying-gawker/">Peter Thiel Made an Offer to Buy Gawker, the Website He Helped Close</a></em></p><p><strong>Are you personally worried?</strong><br> I’d be lying if I said that Thiel’s litigation against Gawker didn’t weigh on me and I think you’d be foolish to not think about that. That said, it’s not productive to be afraid.</p><p><strong>Thiel has been right a lot. I wonder if there’s a bit of you thinking, ‘If he’s been right about these things, what should I be looking for now?’</strong><br> Recently, he gave a speech where he dissed bitcoin, which was a weird thing. If somebody who played a big role in the beginning of digital money is suddenly saying that maybe crypto is bad for the interests of the United States, we should pay attention. There’s an extent to which he’s a great prognosticator, a great futurist. But he’s also a marketer of himself and he’s been very good at accentuating the calls that have been right and and playing down the calls that have been wrong.</p><p><strong>You note that he has funded two senators—Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley—and is now funding two more candidates. Do you worry he’ll wield outsized power over government?</strong><br> I have to say I worry less about the grandstanding of a handful of senators connected to Thiel than I do about the effect of Thiel-ism on the culture. When you combine the hostility to democracy and institutional norms with the bankroll of a billionaire you can potentially do some damage.</p><p><em>This conversation has been lightly condensed and edited for clarity.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NASA and the Italian Space Agency made history on March 3 when the Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE) became the first technology demonstration to acquire and track Earth-based navigation signals on the Moon’s surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The LuGRE payload’s success in lunar orbit and on the surface indicates that signals from the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) can be received and tracked at the Moon. These results mean NASA’s Artemis missions, or other exploration missions, could benefit from these signals to accurately and autonomously determine their position, velocity, and time. This represents a steppingstone to advanced navigation systems and services for the Moon and Mars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“On Earth we can use GNSS signals to navigate in everything from smartphones to airplanes,” said Kevin Coggins, deputy associate administrator for NASA’s SCaN (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/communicating-with-missions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Space Communications and Navigation) Program</a>. “Now, LuGRE shows us that we can successfully acquire and track GNSS signals at the Moon. This is a very exciting discovery for lunar navigation, and we hope to leverage this capability for future missions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<div id="">
<p>Kevin Coggins</p>
<p>Deputy Associate Administrator for NASA SCaN</p>
</div>
<p>The road to the historic milestone began on March 2 when the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/lunar-science/clps-deliveries/to19d-firefly/" rel="noopener">Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost</a> lunar lander touched down on the Moon and delivered LuGRE, one of 10 NASA payloads intended to advance lunar science. Soon after landing, LuGRE payload operators at <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/goddard/">NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center</a> in Greenbelt, Maryland, began conducting their first science operation on the lunar surface.</p>

<p>With the receiver data flowing in, anticipation mounted. Could a Moon-based mission acquire and track signals from two GNSS constellations, GPS and Galileo, and use those signals for navigation on the lunar surface?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, at 2 a.m. EST on March 3, it was official: LuGRE acquired and tracked signals on the lunar surface for the first time ever and achieved a navigation fix — approximately 225,000 miles away from Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that Blue Ghost is on the Moon, the mission will operate for 14 days providing NASA and the Italian Space Agency the opportunity to collect data in a near-continuous mode, leading to additional GNSS milestones. In addition to this record-setting achievement, LuGRE is the first Italian Space Agency developed hardware on the Moon, a milestone for the organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The LuGRE payload also <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2025/02/21/blue-ghost-prepares-for-landing-nasa-instrument-breaks-record/#:~:text=The%20Lunar%20GNSS,on%20the%20Moon." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broke GNSS records on its journey to the Moon</a>. On Jan. 21, LuGRE surpassed the highest altitude GNSS signal acquisition ever recorded at 209,900 miles from Earth, a record formerly held by NASA’s <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission</a>. Its altitude record continued to climb as LuGRE reached lunar orbit on Feb. 20 — 243,000 miles from Earth. This means that missions in cislunar space, the area of space between Earth and the Moon, could also rely on GNSS signals for navigation fixes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Traditionally, NASA engineers track spacecraft by using a combination of measurements, including onboard sensors and signals from Earth-based tracking stations. The LuGRE payload demonstrates that using GNSS signals for navigation can reduce reliance on human operators because these signals can be picked up and used autonomously by the spacecraft, even as far away as the Moon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The LuGRE payload is a collaborative effort between NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, the Italian Space Agency, their industry partner Qascom, and Politecnico di Torino. Funding and oversight for the LuGRE payload comes from NASA’s SCaN Program office. It was chosen by NASA as one of 10 funded research and technology demonstrations for delivery to the lunar surface by Firefly Aerospace Inc., a flight under the agency’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services initiative.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<p>ACM has named <a href="https://awards.acm.org/award-recipients/barto_9471663" target="_blank">Andrew G. Barto</a> and <a href="https://awards.acm.org/award-recipients/sutton_0160594" target="_blank">Richard S. Sutton</a> as the recipients of the 2024 ACM A.M. Turing Award for&nbsp;developing the conceptual and algorithmic foundations of reinforcement learning. In a series of papers beginning in the 1980s, Barto and Sutton introduced the main ideas, constructed the mathematical foundations, and developed important algorithms for reinforcement learning—one of the most important approaches for creating intelligent systems.</p>

<p>Barto is Professor Emeritus of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Sutton is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Alberta, a Research Scientist at Keen Technologies, and a Fellow at Amii&nbsp;(Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute).</p>

<p>The ACM A.M. Turing Award, often referred to as the “Nobel Prize in Computing,” carries a $1 million prize with financial support provided by Google, Inc. The award is named for Alan M. Turing, the British mathematician who articulated the mathematical foundations of computing.</p>

<p><u>What is Reinforcement Learning?</u></p>

<p>The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is generally concerned with constructing agents—that is, entities that perceive and act. More intelligent agents are those that choose better courses of action. Therefore, the notion that some courses of action are better than others is central to AI. Reward—a term borrowed from psychology and neuroscience—denotes a signal provided to an agent related to the quality of its behavior. Reinforcement learning (RL) is the process of learning to behave more successfully given this signal.</p>

<p>The idea of learning from reward has been familiar to animal trainers for thousands of years. Later, Alan Turing’s 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” addressed the question “<em>Can machines think?</em>” and proposed an approach to machine learning based on rewards and punishments.</p>

<div><p>While Turing reported having conducted some initial experiments with this approach and Arthur Samuel developed a checker-playing program in the late 1950s that learned from self-play, little further progress occurred in this vein of AI in the following decades. In the early 1980s, motivated by observations from psychology, Barto and his PhD student Sutton began to formulate reinforcement learning as a general problem framework.</p><p>

They drew on the mathematical foundation provided by Markov decision processes (MDPs), wherein an agent makes decisions in a stochastic (randomly determined) environment, receiving a reward signal after each transition and aiming to maximize its long-term cumulative reward. Whereas standard MDP theory assumes that everything about the MDP is known to the agent, the RL framework allows for the environment and the rewards to be unknown. The minimal information requirements of RL, combined with the generality of the MDP framework, allows RL algorithms to be applied to a vast range of problems, as explained further below.</p></div>

<p>Barto and Sutton, jointly and with others, developed many of the basic algorithmic approaches for RL. These include their foremost contribution, temporal difference learning, which made an important advance in solving reward prediction problems, as well as policy-gradient methods and the use of neural networks as a tool to represent learned functions. They also proposed agent designs that combined learning and planning, demonstrating the value of acquiring knowledge of the environment as a basis for planning.</p>

<p>Perhaps equally influential was their textbook, <em> Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction </em> (1998), which is still the standard reference in the field and has been cited over 75,000 times. It allowed thousands of researchers to understand and contribute to this emerging field and continues to inspire much significant research activity in computer science today.</p>

<p>Although Barto and Sutton’s algorithms were developed decades ago, major advances in the practical applications of RL came about in the past fifteen years by merging RL with deep learning algorithms (pioneered by 2018 Turing Awardees Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun). This led to the technique of deep reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>The most prominent example of RL was the victory by the AlphaGo computer program over the best human <em>Go</em> players in 2016 and 2017. Another major achievement recently has been the development of the chatbot ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM) trained in two phases, the second of which employs a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to capture human expectations.</p>

<p>RL has achieved success in many other areas as well. A high-profile research example is robot motor skill learning in the in-hand robotic manipulation and solution of a physical (Rubik’s Cube), which showed it possible to do all the reinforcement learning in simulation yet ultimately be successful in the significantly different real world.</p>

<p>Other areas include network congestion control, chip design, internet advertising, optimization, global supply chain optimization, improving the behavior and reasoning capabilities of chatbots, and even improving algorithms for one of the oldest problems in computer science, matrix multiplication.</p>

<p>Finally, a technology that was partly inspired by neuroscience has returned the favor. Recent research, including work by Barto, has shown that specific RL algorithms developed in AI provide the best explanations for a wide range of findings concerning the dopamine system in the human brain.</p>

<p>“Barto and Sutton’s work demonstrates the immense potential of applying a multidisciplinary approach to longstanding challenges in our field,” explains ACM President Yannis Ioannidis. “Research areas ranging from cognitive science and psychology to neuroscience inspired the development of reinforcement learning, which has laid the foundations for some of the most important advances in AI and has given us greater insight into how the brain works. Barto and Sutton’s work is not a stepping stone that we have now moved on from. Reinforcement learning continues to grow and offers great potential for further advances in computing and many other disciplines. It is fitting that we are honoring them with the most prestigious award in our field.”</p>

<p>“In a 1947 lecture, Alan Turing stated ‘<em>What we want is a machine that can learn from experience</em>,’” noted Jeff Dean, Senior Vice President, Google. “Reinforcement learning, as pioneered by Barto and Sutton, directly answers Turing’s challenge. Their work has been a lynchpin of progress in AI over the last several decades. The tools they developed remain a central pillar of the AI boom and have rendered major advances, attracted legions of young researchers, and driven billions of dollars in investments. RL’s impact will continue well into the future. Google is proud to sponsor the ACM A.M. Turing Award and honor the individuals who have shaped the technologies that improve our lives.”</p>
