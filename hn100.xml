<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="https://symmetrybreak.ing/images/dont-worry-about-claude/am-i-out-of-touch.webp" alt="Am I out of touch? No, it's the users who are wrong.">
<img src="https://symmetrybreak.ing/images/dont-worry-about-claude/am-i-out-of-touch-dark.webp" alt="Am I out of touch? No, it's the users who are wrong."></p><p>Version 2.1.20 of Claude Code shipped a change that replaced every file read and every search pattern with a single, useless summary line.</p>
<p>Where you used to see:</p>
<p><img src="https://symmetrybreak.ing/images/dont-worry-about-claude/before.png" width="320" alt="Before: individual file paths shown inline"></p><p>You now get:</p>
<p><img src="https://symmetrybreak.ing/images/dont-worry-about-claude/after.png" width="468" alt="After: useless summary"></p><p>That’s it.</p>
<p>“Read 3 files.” Which files? Doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>“Searched for 1 pattern.” What pattern? Who cares.</p>
<p>You’re paying $200 a month for a tool that now hides what it’s doing with your codebase by default.</p>
<p>Across <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/21151">multiple GitHub issues</a> opened for this, all comments are pretty much saying the same thing: give us back the file paths, or at minimum, give us a toggle.</p>
<p>The response from Anthropic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the majority of users, this change is a nice simplification that reduces noise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://symmetrybreak.ing/images/dont-worry-about-claude/what-majority.webp" width="300" alt="What the hell are you talking about?"></p><p>What majority? The change just shipped and the only response it got is people complaining.</p>
<p>Then when pressed, the fix offered wasn’t to revert or add a toggle. It was: “just use verbose mode.”</p>
<p>Fucking <em>verbose mode</em>.</p>
<p>A big ‘ole dump of thinking traces, hook output, full subagent transcripts, and entire file contents into your terminal. People explained, repeatedly, that they wanted one specific thing: file paths and search patterns inline. Not a firehose of debug output.</p>
<p>The developer’s response to that?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to hear folks’ feedback on what’s missing from verbose mode to make it the right approach for your use case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://symmetrybreak.ing/images/dont-worry-about-claude/u-wot-m8.webp" width="450" alt="u wot m8"></p><p>Read that again. Thirty people say “revert the change or give us a toggle.” The answer is “let me make verbose mode work for you instead.”</p>
<p>As one commenter put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are going to display something like ‘Searched for 13 patterns, read 2 files’ there is nothing I can do with that information. You might as well not display it at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several versions later, the “fix” is to keep making verbose mode less and less verbose by removing thinking traces and hook output so it becomes a tolerable way to get your file paths back. But verbose mode still dumps full sub-agent output onto your screen, among other things.</p>
<p><img src="https://symmetrybreak.ing/images/dont-worry-about-claude/dont-worry.webp" width="470" alt="Don't worry"></p><p>Before, when Claude spawned multiple sub-agents you’d see a compact line-by-line stream of what each one was doing, just enough to glance at. Now you get walls of text from multiple agents at once. So what’s the plan? Keep stripping things out of verbose mode one by one until it’s no longer verbose? Where does it end? At some point you’ve just reinvented a config toggle with extra steps.</p>
<p><img src="https://symmetrybreak.ing/images/dont-worry-about-claude/galaxy-brain.webp" width="404" alt="Galaxy brain"></p><p>And the people who were using verbose mode for thinking and hooks now need to press Ctrl+O to get what they had by default. So instead of fixing one problem, you created two.</p>
<p>People are pinning themselves to version 2.1.19 and in the meantime the fix everyone is asking for, a single boolean config flag, would take less effort to implement than all the verbose mode surgery that’s been done instead.</p>
<p>Anthropic during the Super Bowl: we’d never disrespect our users.</p>
<p>Anthropic on GitHub: have you tried verbose mode?</p> <!-- Renders the Markdown content --> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <!-- Description -->
        <p>
            <strong>Fluorite is the first console-grade game engine fully integrated with Flutter.</strong><br>
            Its reduced complexity by allowing you to write your game code directly in Dart, and using all of its great
            developer tools.
            By using a <code>FluoriteView</code> widget you can add multiple simultaneous views of your 3D scene,
            as well as share state between game Entities and UI widgets - the Flutter way!
        </p>

        <!-- Sections -->

            <div>
                <h3>High-performance ECS core</h3>
                <p>
                    At the heart of Fluorite lies a data-oriented ECS (Entity-Component-System) architecture.
                    It's written in C++ to allow for maximum performance and targeted optimizations, yielding great
                    performance on lower-end/embedded hardware.
                    At the same time, it allows you to write game code using familiar high-level game APIs in Dart,
                    making most of your game development knowledge transferrable from other engines.
                </p>

            <div>
                <h3>Model-defined touch trigger zones</h3>
                <p>
                    This feature enables 3D Artists to define “clickable” zones directly in Blender, and to configure
                    them to trigger specific events!
                    Developers can then listen to <code>onClick</code> events with the specified tags to trigger all
                    sorts of interactions!
                    This simplifies the process of creating spatial 3D UI, enabling users to engage with objects and
                    controls in a more intuitive way.

            <div>
                <h3>Console-grade 3D Rendering</h3>
                <p>
                    Powered by Google's Filament renderer, Fluorite leverages modern graphics APIs such as Vulkan to
                    deliver stunning, hardware-accelerated visuals
                    comparable to those found on gaming consoles. With support for physically-accurate lighting and
                    assets, post-processing effects, and custom shaders,
                    the developers can create visually rich and captivating environments.
                </p>

        <!-- 4. Hot Reload -->
        <section id="hot-reload">

                <h3>Hot Reload</h3>
                <p>
                    Thanks to its Flutter/Dart integration, Fluorite's scenes are enabled for Hot Reload!
                    This allows developers to update their scenes and see the changes within just a couple frames.
                    This significantly speeds up the development process, enabling rapid iteration and
                    testing of game mechanics, assets, and code.

On a more encouraging note: hiring has picked up in 2026.</p><p id="anchor-f1000e">Preliminary data had indicated that the U.S. economy added 584,000 jobs last year. But the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised that number after it received additional state data, and found that the labor market had added 181,000 jobs in all of 2025. </p><p id="anchor-c1c88a">This is far fewer than the 1.46 million jobs that were added in 2024. </p><p id="anchor-ad2654">One bright spot was last month, when hiring increased by 130,000 roles. This was significantly more than the 55,000 additions that had been expected by economists. </p><p id="anchor-d5a074">“Job gains occurred in health care, social assistance, and construction, while federal government and financial activities lost jobs,” BLS said in a statement</p><p id="anchor-96c43f">Wednesday’s reports further complicate the task for President Donald Trump and Republicans as they attempt to craft an economic narrative going into the 2026 midterm elections. Polls show that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trumps-approval-rating-takes-hit-first-year-back-office-rcna253192" target="_blank">the president’s approval rating on the economy has declined</a>, while consumer sentiment <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/us-consumer-sentiment-improves-modestly-february-2026-02-06/" target="_blank">has been poor,</a> particularly around the jobs market.</p><p id="anchor-dc6b7b">Manufacturing, a key industry targeted for growth by the Trump administration, was among the industries that saw “little change” in January, the agency said. Still, factory jobs rose 5,000 in the month, for their first increase since January 2024. Analysts expected a contraction. </p><figure id="anchor-e86942"><picture data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1667" data-original-width="2500"><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2026-02/260210-job-fair-ch-1516-c93ac0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-02/260210-job-fair-ch-1516-c93ac0.jpg 1x"><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2026-02/260210-job-fair-ch-1516-c93ac0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-02/260210-job-fair-ch-1516-c93ac0.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-02/260210-job-fair-ch-1516-c93ac0.jpg" alt="Job fair." height="1667" width="2500"></picture><figcaption data-testid="caption"><span data-testid="caption__container">Job seekers in Boone, N.C., in 2025.</span><span data-testid="caption__source">Allison Joyce / Bloomberg via Getty Images file</span></figcaption></figure><p id="anchor-a0dba1">The health care sector was the largest contributor to job gains in January, adding a net 137,000 jobs. Over the course of the last year, that sector has been the driving force behind job gains. </p><p id="anchor-396dd3">The leisure and hospitality sector added only 1,000 jobs in January, which many economists have described in recent months as something that would be a red flag given how reliant the industry is on consumer spending. </p><p id="anchor-f92dd1">The unemployment rate fell from 4.4% to 4.3% in January.</p><p id="anchor-586c2d">Still, Wednesday’s report also shows that not nearly as many jobs were added in 2025 as thought and last year will go down as the worst year for hiring since 2020, or since 2003 outside of a recession.</p><p id="anchor-7efcb4">Additionally, the BLS subtracted 862,000 jobs from March 2024 through March 2025 as part of its annual revisions.</p><p id="anchor-0ed9b5">For 2025, Wednesday’s revisions show that the labor market contracted during four months — January, June, August and October. Previously, data showed a net loss of jobs in only three months.</p><p id="anchor-8fd6e6">The average revisions to U.S. jobs data have been steeper in the years since 2020 than they were before the pandemic. Economists and analysts largely attribute this to a shift in labor market dynamics and survey response rates.</p><p id="anchor-579487">The massive revisions down were not entirely unexpected, however. BLS previously projected a downward revision of 911,000 for 2024-2025. </p><p id="anchor-4bee7c">Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also said recently that last year’s hiring numbers were likely too rosy.</p><p id="anchor-f41e63">“We think there’s an overstatement in these numbers by about 60,000, so that would be negative 20,000 per month,” Powell said in a Dec. 10 press conference. </p><p id="anchor-77a243">“I think you can say that the labor market has continued to cool gradually, maybe just a touch more gradually than we thought,” he continued. </p><p id="anchor-7ad06b">For investors, Wednesday’s report could indicate that the labor market is finding its footing and stabilizing but comes after three straight months of rocky numbers. </p><p id="anchor-769e58">Given that the report still lacks the crystal-clear clarity that investors and the Fed are seeking, Treasury bonds fell in early trading Wednesday and their yields rose. The futures markets indicated that traders don’t see much of a chance of a rate cut until July at the earliest.  </p></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/steve-kopack-ncpn387336" tabindex="-1"><picture data-testid="picture" data-flavor="focal" data-original-height="48" data-original-width="48"><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2024_51/3672748/steve_kopack.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2024_51/3672748/steve_kopack.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2024_51/3672748/steve_kopack.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></a></div><p>Steve Kopack is a senior reporter at NBC News covering business and the economy.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-bvzihdzo=""> <article data-astro-cid-bvzihdzo="">  <div data-astro-cid-bvzihdzo=""> <div data-astro-cid-bvzihdzo=""> <p><time datetime="2026-02-09T00:00:00.000Z"> Feb 9, 2026 </time> <span data-astro-cid-bvzihdzo=""> · 14 min read</span>  </p>   <hr data-astro-cid-bvzihdzo=""> </div>   <p>I recently wrote about <a href="https://machielreyneke.com/blog/longevity-lessons/">what the longevity experts don’t tell you</a>. Since then, I’ve been thinking about why so many of the people in this space are obsessed with blood transfusions specifically. It seemed like a strange fixation — until I looked at the evidence properly.</p>
<p>I think they’re vampires. Not metaphorically. I think the modern longevity movement is a vampire disclosure program.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<h2 id="the-science">The Science</h2>
<p>In 1864, a French physiologist named Paul Bert surgically connected two mice so they shared a circulatory system.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> When he connected an old mouse to a young one, the old mouse got younger. The technique is called parabiosis, from the Greek <em>para</em> (next to) and <em>bios</em> (life), which is also how vampires have historically described feeding.</p>
<p>By the 1950s, researchers at Cornell had extended this work and found that old rats connected to young rats lived four to five months longer than controls.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> The scientific community filed this under “interesting but impractical” and moved on.</p>
<p>Then in 2005, Stanford researchers revived the technique and showed that within five weeks, old mice connected to young mice had muscle and liver tissue that resembled young tissue.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> This made international headlines. The framing was: “Scientists discover young blood reverses aging.”</p>
<p>The vampires, presumably, were not surprised.</p>
<h2 id="the-suspects">The Suspects</h2>
<h3 id="peter-thiel">Peter Thiel</h3>
<p>Consider the facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pale. Gaunt. Appears to not age but also to never have been young.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup></li>

<h3 id="bryan-johnson">Bryan Johnson</h3>
<p>Johnson is more complicated, because he appears to be conducting his vampirism in public. This is either a strategic error or an unprecedented act of courage.</p>
<ul>
<li>He transfused his 17-year-old son’s blood plasma into his own body. His son, Talmage, also received Johnson’s plasma in return. Johnson framed this as “multi-generational plasma exchange.”<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-14" id="user-content-fnref-14" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">14</a></sup> Vampires have historically called this “turning.”</li>

<li>His company is called Blueprint. As in: he is sharing the blueprint.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-historical-record">The Historical Record</h2>
<p>The longevity community presents parabiosis research as a modern scientific breakthrough. This is wrong. Blood-based life extension has been documented for millennia:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roman spectators rushed into arenas to drink the blood of fallen gladiators, believing it transferred vitality.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-17" id="user-content-fnref-17" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">17</a></sup> The scientific community calls this “anecdotal.” Vampires call it “dining out.”</li>
<li>In 1489, the Italian philosopher and Catholic priest Marsilio Ficino published <em>De Vita Libri Tres</em>, in which he explicitly recommended that the elderly suck the blood of a youth from a vein in the left arm. His exact words: “Why shouldn’t our old people, namely those who have no other recourse, likewise suck the blood of a youth?”<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-18" id="user-content-fnref-18" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">18</a></sup> He published this. Openly. In a book. As a priest.</li>
<li>Elizabeth Báthory, a 16th-century Hungarian noblewoman, allegedly tortured and murdered hundreds of young women. Legends that she bathed in their blood to retain her youth first appeared in print over a century after her death and are likely embellished, but she was nonetheless confined — possibly walled up — in a room in her own castle until she died.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-19" id="user-content-fnref-19" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">19</a></sup> Which is exactly what you’d expect humans to do to a vampire they couldn’t kill.</li>
<li>Bram Stoker published <em>Dracula</em> in 1897. The novel features a centuries-old aristocrat who sustains himself on young blood, sleeps in unusual conditions, has extraordinary physical abilities for his apparent age, and is eventually destroyed by a group of people who figure out what he is. Stoker, a theatre manager with no medical background, somehow described the basic mechanism of heterochronic parabiosis almost perfectly — ninety years before Stanford “discovered” it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The standard explanation is that Stoker drew on Eastern European folklore. The alternative explanation is that Stoker drew on Eastern European vampires.</p>
<h2 id="the-twist">The Twist</h2>
<p>Here’s what’s genuinely interesting. Recent research from UC Berkeley suggests that the benefit of young blood might not come from something <em>in</em> the young blood. It might come from <em>diluting</em> the old blood.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-20" id="user-content-fnref-20" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">20</a></sup> The young blood doesn’t add youth. It removes age.</p>
<p>If true, this reframes the entire vampire mythology. Vampires don’t drink blood because young blood contains an elixir. They drink blood because their own blood accumulates factors that accelerate aging, and they need to periodically dilute it. Feeding isn’t nutrition. It’s dialysis.</p>
<p>This also explains why vampires need to feed <em>regularly</em>. The effect is temporary. The old blood factors rebuild. This is consistent with the Stanford mouse data, where the rejuvenating effects diminished after the mice were separated.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-21" id="user-content-fnref-21" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">21</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="the-disclosure-timeline">The Disclosure Timeline</h2>
<p>I believe we are watching a carefully managed disclosure:</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1 (1864–2000):</strong> Scientific groundwork. Establish parabiosis as a legitimate research technique. Build the academic cover story.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-22" id="user-content-fnref-22" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">22</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Phase 2 (2005–2015):</strong> “Breakthrough” papers from Stanford, Harvard, Berkeley. Seed the idea that blood-based rejuvenation is <em>scientifically plausible</em> rather than supernatural.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-23" id="user-content-fnref-23" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">23</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Phase 3 (2016–2023):</strong> Early adopters go public. Thiel funds blood startups. Johnson transfuses his son on camera. The public begins to associate blood transfusion with eccentric billionaires rather than with undead predators. This is a critical narrative shift.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 4 (2024–present):</strong> Normalisation. Podcasts. Netflix documentaries.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-24" id="user-content-fnref-24" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">24</a></sup> The word “parabiosis” enters mainstream vocabulary. By the time full disclosure happens, the public will have been primed to see vampirism as a “wellness protocol” rather than a curse.</p>
<h2 id="what-dracula-got-wrong">What Dracula Got Wrong</h2>
<p>The one thing the longevity-vampire community has not yet learned from Dracula is operational security.</p>
<p>Dracula operated in silence for centuries. He didn’t have a podcast. He didn’t track his erection quality on a public dashboard. He didn’t appear on Netflix. He understood that the fundamental rule of being a vampire is: <em>don’t talk about being a vampire.</em></p>
<p>Johnson, Thiel, and their cohort have broken this rule comprehensively. Whether this represents a new era of transparency or a catastrophic strategic miscalculation remains to be seen.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I will be monitoring their blood work with interest.</p>

Why shouldn’t our old people, namely those who have no other recourse, likewise suck the blood of a youth? — a youth, I say, who is willing, healthy, happy and temperate, whose blood is of the best but perhaps too abundant. They will suck, therefore, like leeches, an ounce or two from a scarcely-opened vein of the left arm.” He then adds that if they have difficulty digesting raw blood, they should cook it with sugar first.

<p>You don’t need to apologize for taking hours, days, or years to reply to one of my emails.</p>
<p>If we are not close collaborators, and if I didn’t explicitly tell you I was waiting for your answer within a specific timeframe, then please stop apologizing for replying late!</p>
<p>This is a trend I’m witnessing, probably caused by the addiction to instant messaging. Most of the emails I receive these days contain some sort of apology. I received an apology from someone who took five hours to reply to what was a cold and unimportant email. I received apologies in what was a reply to a reply I had sent only a couple of days earlier.</p>
<p>Apologizing for taking time to reply to my email is awkward and makes me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It also puts a lot of pressure on me: what if I take more time than you to reply? Isn’t the whole point of asynchronous communication to be… asynchronous? Each on its own rhythm?</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-1">I was not waiting for your email in the first place.</h2>
<p>As soon as my email was sent, I probably forgot about it. I may have thought a lot before writing it. I may have drafted it multiple times. Or not. But as soon as it was in my outbox, it was also out of my mind. </p>
<p>That’s the very point of asynchronous communication. That’s why I use email. I’m not making any assumptions about your availability.</p>
<p>Most of the emails I send are replies to emails I received. So, no, I was not waiting for a reply to my reply.</p>
<p>My email might also be an idea I wanted to share with you, a suggestion, a random thought, a way to connect. In all cases, I’m not sitting there, waiting impatiently for your answer. </p>
<p>Even if my email was about requesting some help or collaborating with you, I’ve been trying to move forward anyway. Your reply, whenever it comes, will only be a bonus. But, except if we are in close collaboration and I explicitly said so in the email, I’m not waiting for you!</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-2">I don’t want to know all the details of your life.</h2>
<p>Yes, you took several days to reply to my email. That’s OK. I don’t need to know that it’s because your mother was dying of cancer or that you were expelled from your house. I’m not making those up! I really receive that kind of apology from people who took several days to reply to emails that look trivial in comparison.</p>
<p>Life happens. If you have things more important to do than replying to my email, then, for god’s sake, don’t reply to it. I get it! I’m human too. If I sometimes reply to all the emails I receive for several days, I may also archive them quickly for weeks because I don’t have the mental space.</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-3">If you want to reply but don’t have time, put the burden on me</h2>
<p>If I’m asking you something and you really would like to take the time to reply to my email, it is OK to simply send one line like</p>
<blockquote> Hey Ploum, I don’t have the time and mental space right now. Could you contact me again in 6 months to discuss this idea?<br></blockquote>
<p>Then archive or delete my email. That’s fine. If I really want your input, I will manage to remind you in 6 months. You don’t need to justify. You don’t need to explain. Being short saves time for both of us.</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-4">You don’t need to reply at all!</h2>
<p>Except if explicitly stated, don’t feel any pressure to reply to one of my emails. Feel free to read and discard the email. Feel free to think about it. Feel free to reply to it, even years later, if it makes sense for you. But, most importantly, feel free not to care!</p>
<p>We all receive too many messages in a day. We all have to make choices. We cannot follow all the paths that look interesting because we are all constrained by having, at most, a couple billion seconds left to live.</p>
<p>Consider whether replying adds any value to the discussion. Is a trivial answer really needed? Is there really something to add? Can’t we both save time by you not replying? </p>
<p>If my email is already a reply to yours, is there something you really want to add? At some point, it is better to stop the conversation. And, as I said, it is not rude: I’m not waiting for your reply!</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-5">Don’t tell me you will reply later!</h2>
<p>Some people specialize in answering email by explaining why they have no time and that they will reply later.</p>
<p>If I’m not explicitly waiting for you, then that’s the very definition of a useless email. That also adds a lot of cognitive load on you: you promised to answer! The fact that you wrote it makes your brain believe that replying to my email is a daunting task. How will you settle for a quick reply after that? What am I supposed to do with such a non-reply email?</p>
<p>In case an acknowledgement is needed, a simple reply with "thanks" or "received" is enough to inform me that you’ve got the message. Or "ack" if you are a geek.</p>
<h2 id="soustitre-6">If you do reply, remind me of the context</h2>
<p>If you choose to reply, consider that I have switched to completely different tasks and may have forgotten the context of my own message. When online, my attention span is measured in seconds, so it doesn’t matter if you take 30 minutes or 30 days to answer my email: I guarantee you that I forgot about it.</p>
<p>Consequently, please keep the original text of the whole discussion!</p>
<p>Use bottom-posting style to reply to each question or remark in the body of the original mail itself. Don’t hesitate to cut out parts of the original email that are not needed anymore. Feel free to ignore large parts of the email. It is fine to give a one-line answer to a very long question.</p>
<p>I’m trying to make my emails structured. If there are questions I want you to answer, each question will be on its own line and will end with a question mark. If you do not see such lines, then there’s probably no question to answer.</p>
<p>If you do top posting, please remind me briefly of the context we are in.</p>
<blockquote> Dear Ploum,<p>  I contacted you 6 months ago about my "fooing the bar" project after we met at FOSDEM. You replied to my email with a suggestion of "baring the foo." You also asked a lot of questions. I will answer those below in your own email:</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, that’s basic mailing-list etiquette.<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Mailing_list_etiquette">Mailing list etiquette (www.mediawiki.org)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="soustitre-7">No, seriously, I don’t expect you to reply!</h2>
<p>If there’s one thing to remember, it’s that I don’t expect you to reply. I’m not waiting for it. I have a life, a family, and plenty of projects. The chance I’m thinking about the email I sent you is close to zero. No, it is literally zero.</p>
<p>So don’t feel pressured to reply. Should you really reply in the first place? In case of doubt, drop the email. Life will continue.</p>
<p>If you do reply, I will be honored, whatever time it took for you to send it.</p>
<p>In any case, whatever you choose, do not apologize for replying late!</p>

In 2017, M. Weissbacher et al. research on malicious browser extensions. In 2018, R. Heaton showed that the popular “Stylish” theme manager was silently sending browsing URLs to a remote server. Those past reports cought our eye and motivated us to dig into this issue.</p><p>Fast forward to 2025: Chome Store now hosts roughly 240 k extensions, many of them with hundreds of thousands of users. We knew that we needed a scalable, repeatable method to measure whether an extension was actually leaking data in the wild.</p><p>It was shown in the past that chrome extensions are used to exfiltrate user browser history that is then collected by data brokers such as Similarweb and Alexa. We try to prove in this report that Similarweb is very much still active and collects data.</p><p>Why does it matter? There is a moral aspect to the whole issue. Imagine that you build your business model on data exfiltration via innocent looking extensions and using that data to sell them to big corporates. Well, that’s how Similarweb is getting part of the data. That should remind us that whatever software you are using for free and it is not open sourced, you should assume you are the product. The second aspect is that it puts the users into danger and potentially this could be used for corporate exfiltration. Even if only browsed URLs are exfiltrated, they typically contain personal identifications, that way bad actors that would pay for the raw collected traffic can try to target individuals.</p><p>We considered sharing the details of the setup, but we considered this will only enable attackers to adapt quicker to this method. For this reason we will not share the code nor the exact details of the setup.</p><p>We developed our internal research framework that was inspired by M. Weissbacher et al. work:</p><ol><li><p>Docker with Chromium based browser.</p></li><li><p>MITM proxy.</p></li><li><p><span>Synthetic browsing workloads (increasing consistent payload send to </span><a href="http://google.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">google.com</a><span>, this request never left docker container).</span></p></li><li><p>Simple regression model to see if there is corelation between outbound traffic volume and the length of the URLs we request.</p></li></ol><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7Bgo!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9af6a5b-53a2-4c7e-be70-540f4d86cfc1_854x412.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7Bgo!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9af6a5b-53a2-4c7e-be70-540f4d86cfc1_854x412.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7Bgo!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9af6a5b-53a2-4c7e-be70-540f4d86cfc1_854x412.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7Bgo!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9af6a5b-53a2-4c7e-be70-540f4d86cfc1_854x412.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7Bgo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9af6a5b-53a2-4c7e-be70-540f4d86cfc1_854x412.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7Bgo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9af6a5b-53a2-4c7e-be70-540f4d86cfc1_854x412.png" width="854" height="412" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e9af6a5b-53a2-4c7e-be70-540f4d86cfc1_854x412.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:412,&quot;width&quot;:854,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:40092,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://qcontinuum.substack.com/i/187273593?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9af6a5b-53a2-4c7e-be70-540f4d86cfc1_854x412.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7Bgo!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9af6a5b-53a2-4c7e-be70-540f4d86cfc1_854x412.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7Bgo!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9af6a5b-53a2-4c7e-be70-540f4d86cfc1_854x412.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7Bgo!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9af6a5b-53a2-4c7e-be70-540f4d86cfc1_854x412.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7Bgo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9af6a5b-53a2-4c7e-be70-540f4d86cfc1_854x412.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The idea was simple: if an extension is just reading the page title or injecting CSS, its network footprint should stay flat regardless of how long the URL we visit is. If the outbound traffic grows linearly with the URL length, we have a high probability that the extension is shipping the URL itself (or the entire HTTP request) to a remote server.</p><p><code>mitmdump</code><span> writes every request/response to a JSON file.

If </span><code>0.1 ≤ R &lt; 1.0</code><span> we flag it as probable leakage and send it for manual review. We scanned the leakage in two stages first only 4 different payload sizes and if the condition </span><code>0.1 ≤ R &lt; 1.0</code><span> was fullfilled we continued with additional differen 6 payload sizes. Considering o naverage 10 minute scan it took us 930 CPU days to perform the scan. For scans that would take 1 day per extension, different strategy would need to be considered. Perhaps only the extensions with higher user counts could be scanned for longer period of time.</span></p><p>The exfiltrated data can be in some cases sold to data brokers such as Similarweb. Data brokers put together those data and can resell them further to consumers. M. Weissbacher et al. research showed that third parties are interested in scraping those data for unknown reasons, perhaps to monetize the information gathered.

It encrypts your data using that AES key. It takes that one-time AES key and encrypts it using a Public RSA Key hardcoded in the script. It bundles the encrypted key and the encrypted data together and sends them to the server. To decrypt the data, we need the AES key. To get the AES key, we need to decrypt the key blockand that is only possible with the RSA Private Key. With altering the code it would be possible to pause service worker and capture this AES generated key. We will leave this as fun exercise to the reader. The leakage for this endpoint is confirmed as the encrypted payload grows with longer browsed URL.</p><p>For the record here is the code where the encrypton is done.</p><pre><code><code>_ProductsContainer._createAnimation8 = {

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>There's a default assumption baked into how Silicon Valley builds products, and it tracks against how urban planners redesign neighbourhoods: that communities are interchangeable, and if you "lose" one, you can manufacture a replacement; that the value of a group of people who share space and history can be captured in a metric and deployed at scale.</p><p>Economists have a word for assets that can be swapped one-for-one without loss of value: fungible. A dollar is fungible. A barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude is fungible. </p><p>...A mass of people bound together by years of shared context, inside jokes and collective memory is not.</p><p>And yet we keep treating communities as though they are.</p><p>When a platform migrates its user base to a new architecture, the implicit promise is that the community will survive the move. When a city demolishes a public housing block and offers residents vouchers for market-rate apartments across town, the implicit promise is that they'll rebuild what they had.</p><p>These promises are always broken, and the people making them either don't understand why, or they're relying on the rest of us being too blind to see it.</p><h2 id="what-robert-moses-got-wrong">What Robert Moses got wrong...</h2><p>Robert Moses displaced an estimated 250,000 people over the course of his career, razing entire neighbourhoods to make way for expressways and public works projects. The defence of Moses, then and now, is utilitarian: more people benefited from the infrastructure than were harmed by its construction. The calculus assumed that the displaced residents could form equivalent communities elsewhere, and the relationships severed by a highway cutting through a block were replaceable with relationships formed in a new location. Jane Jacobs spent much of her career arguing that this was catastrophically wrong. The old neighbourhood was not a collection of individuals who happened to live near each other; it was a living organism with its own immune system and its own way of metabolising change. When Moses bulldozed it, he killed a community and scattered the remains.</p><p>Jacobs understood that the value of a community isn't in the people as discrete units. The value is in the specific, unreproducible web of relationships between them. You can move every single resident of a street to the same new street in the same new suburb and you will not get the same community, because community is a function of time and ten thousand microtransactions of reciprocity that nobody tracks and nobody can mandate.</p><h2 id="and-what-economists-miss">...and what economists miss</h2><p>In a model, agents are interchangeable. Consumer A and Consumer B have different preference curves, yes, but they respond to the same incentive structures in predictable ways. Community is what you get when agents stop being interchangeable to each other. When Alice doesn't need "a neighbour" but needs <em>that</em> neighbour, the one who watched her kids that time, the one who knows she's allergic to peanuts. The relationship is specific, and specificity is the enemy of fungibility.</p><p>This is why so many attempts to "build community" from scratch end up producing something that looks like community but functions like a mailing list. The startup that launches a Discord server and calls it a community // the coworking space that holds a monthly mixer and calls it a community etc. What they've actually built is a directory of loosely affiliated strangers who share a single contextual overlap.</p><p>That's a starting condition for community, but it's not community itself, and the difference is like the difference between a pile of lumber and a house. The raw materials are necessary but wildly insufficient.</p><h2 id="when-platforms-die-communities-dont-migrate">When platforms die, communities don't migrate</h2><p>The internet has run this experiment dozens of times now, and the results are consistent. When a platform dies or degrades, its community does not simply migrate to the next platform, it fragments, and the ones who do arrive at the new place find that the social dynamics are different, the norms have shifted, and a substantial number of the people who made the old place feel like home are gone. LiveJournal's Russian acquisition scattered its English-speaking community across Dreamwidth and eventually Twitter. Each successor captured a fraction of the original user base and none of them captured the culture. The community that existed on LiveJournal in 2006 is extinct and cannot be reassembled. The specific conditions that created it, a particular moment in internet history when blogging was new and social media hadn't yet been colonised by algorithmic feeds and engagement optimisation, no longer exist.</p><p>You can see the pattern in Vine's death and the migration to Snapchat x TikTok, with Twitter's degradation and the scattering to Threads, Bluesky and Mastodon. In every case, the platform's architects // successors assumed that the product was the platform and the community was an emergent feature that would re-emerge given similar conditions. They had the relationship exactly backwards. The community was the product and the platform was the container, and when the container breaks, the product spills and evaporates, and some of it is lost forever.</p><h2 id="dunbars-layers-the-archaeology-of-trust">Dunbar's layers + the archaeology of trust</h2><p>Robin Dunbar's research on social group sizes tells us that humans maintain relationships in rough layers: about five intimate relationships, fifteen close ones, fifty good friends, and a hundred and fifty meaningful acquaintances. These aren't arbitrary numbers; they mirror cognitive and emotional bandwidth constraints that are probably neurological in origin. What Dunbar's model implies about community is underappreciated. If a community is a network of overlapping Dunbar layers, then each member's experience of the community is unique, shaped by where they sit in the web. There is no "the community" in any objective sense. There are as many communities as there are members, each one a different cross-section of the same social graph, and this means that when you lose members, you lose entire subjective communites that existed literally nowhere else.</p><p>When a Roman town was abandoned, the physical structures decayed at different rates. Stone walls lasted centuries while textiles vanished in years. The social structure of a community decays the same way when it's disrupted. The institutional relationships, the stone walls, might survive: people will still know each other's names and professional roles. The close friendships might last a while, held together by active effort. But the ambient trust, the willingness to lend a tool without being asked or to tolerate a minor annoyance because you've built up enough goodwill to absorb it, that's the textile, and it goes first. Once it's gone, what's left = a skeleton that looks like a community but has lost the capacity to function like one.</p><h2 id="why-build-a-new-one-doesnt-work">Why "build a new one" doesn't work</h2><p>There's a fantasy popular among technologists and policymakers that community can be engineered. That if you identify the right variables and apply the right interventions, you can produce community on demand. This fantasy has a name in the urbanist literature: it's called "new town syndrome," after the observation that Britain's postwar new towns, carefully designed with all the amenities a community could need, produced widespread anomie and social isolation in their early decades. Stevenage had shops, schools, parks and pubs. What it didn't have was history. The residents had no shared past and no slowly accumulated social capital. They had proximity without context, and proximity without context is a crowd.</p><p>The same problem pops up in every domain where someone tries to instantiate community from a blueprint. Corporate culture initiatives and neighbourhood revitalisation programs tend to optimise for the visible markers of community, events and shared spaces, while ignoring the invisible substrate that makes those markers meaningful. It's like building an elaborate birdhouse and assuming birds will come, and when they don't, the birdhouse builders typically conclude that they need a better birdhouse, rather than questioning wether birdhouses are how you get birds.</p><h2 id="you-cant-rerun-the-history">You can't rerun the history</h2><p>The destruction of a community is largely irreversible. You can rebuild a building and you can replant a forest and, given enough decades, get something that resembles the original ecosystem. But a community that took twenty years to develop its particular structure of norms and mutual knowledge cannot be regrown in twenty years, because the conditions that shaped it no longer exist. The people are older, the context has changed, and the specific convergance of circumstances that brought those particular individuals together in that particular configuration at that particular time is gone. Communities are path-dependent in the strongest possible sense: their current state is a function of their entire history, and you can't rerun the history.</p><p>Ursula K. Le Guin wrote in <em>The Dispossessed</em> about the tension between a society that valued radical freedom and the structures that emerged organically to make collective life possible. Her protagonist, Shevek, discovers that even in a society designed to prevent the accumulation of power, informal hierarchies and social obligations develop on their own, shaped by nothing more than time and proximity. Le Guin understood that community structure isn't designed, it's deposited, like sediment, by the slow accumulation of interactions that nobody planned and nobody controls.</p><h2 id="so-what-do-we-actually-owe-existing-communities">So what do we actually owe existing communities?</h2><p>If communities are non-fungible, if they can't be replaced once destroyed, then every decision that disrupts an existing community carries a cost that is systematically undervalued. The cost doesn't show up in a spreadsheet because it's not a line item, it's the loss of a particular, specific, irreproducible social configuration that provided its members with things that can't be purchased on the open market: ambient trust and the comfort of being known.</p><p>Displacement - whether physical or digital - is more expensive than anyone budgets for. The burden of proof should fall on the displacer, not the displaced, to demonstrate that the benefits of disruption outweigh the destruction of social capital that took years or decades to accumulate. And the glib promise of "we'll build something even better" should be treated with the same scepticism as a contractor who promises to replace your load-bearing wall with something decorative. It is, to be frank, bullshit. </p><p>Communities are not resources to be optimised and they're not user bases to be migrated. They're the accumulated residue of people choosing, over and over again, to remain in a relationship with each other under specific conditions that will never, ever recur in exactly the same way. </p><p>Treating them as fungible is idiotic, and we have been far too willing to let it happen unchallenged.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>
  Ok, it is over.  End of an era for me.  No more self-hosted git.  I
  had a public git server running since 2011, and a public cvs server
  before that.  AI scrapers have hammered the poor, little server to
  death by flooding the cgit frontend with tons of pointless²
  requests.  Actually a few months ago already.
</p>
<p>
  Now I finally decided to not try rebuild the server, be it with or
  without cgit web frontend.  I don't feel like taking up the fight
  with the scrapers in my spare time, I leave that to people who are
  in a better position to do so.  Most repositories had mirrors on one
  or two of the large gitforges already.  Those are the primary
  repositories now.  Go look
  at <a href="https://gitlab.com/users/kraxel/projects">gitlab</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/kraxel?tab=repositories">github</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Last week I've fixed all (I hope) dangeling links to the cgit
  repsitories to point to the forges instead.
</p>
<p>
  Now I'm down to one self-hosted service, which is the webserver
  hosting mainly this blog and a few more little things.  In 2018 I've
  migrated the blog from wordpress to jekyll, so it is all static
  pages.  Taking this out by AI scrapers overloading the machine should
  be next to impossible, and so far this has hold up.
</p>
<p>
  Nevertheless AI scrapers already managed to trigger one outage.
  Apparently millions of 404 answers where not enough to convince the
  bots that there is no cgit service (any more).  Apache had no
  problems to deliver those, but the logs have filled up the disk so
  fast that logrotate didn't manage to keep things under control with
  the default configuration.  Fixed config.  Knook wood.
</p>

  ¹ Title inspired by
  the <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-security-nightmares">2025
  edition of Security Nightmares</a>.  Fun watching if you speak
  german.
  <br>
  ² Most inefficient way to get the complete repo.  Just clone it, ok?

<p>These small boards were built to demonstrate individual devices from pinball machines.&nbsp; They all have 24v (for relays and solenoids) and 6v (for lamps) AC power wired along the back.&nbsp; Each board attaches to its neighbor on the left side to form a string of display boards wired together.&nbsp; The first board in the string attaches to a transformer which supplies power to all boards in the string.&nbsp; Using the same connectors on each board allows the boards to be laid out in any order, and makes it easy to swap out or remove a board if it breaks down.</p>

<p>Each of the display boards is shown below with its instruction card which is typically propped up behind the board.</p>

<p>Click on any thumbnail to jump to the details section for that device.</p>

<h2><a id="TheBasics" name="TheBasics"></a>The Basics</h2>

<p>These devices represent the simplest building blocks of most electromechanical pinball machines.</p>

<h3><a id="Solenoid" name="Solenoid"></a>Solenoid</h3>

<p>Solenoids drive most of the motion in a pinball machine and are featured in most of the other displays.&nbsp; This solenoid is purposely weak and slow moving to show how it can lift the steel plunger when power is applied.&nbsp; Normally solenoids move their plungers so quickly that they are hard to follow.</p>

<p>This video shows how the solenoid works.&nbsp; In this case the steel plunger is attached to a wooden dowel with a round target at the top to better show the motion of the plunger as it is drawn into the solenoid.</p>

<h3><a id="Relays" name="Relays"></a>Relays</h3>

<p>Relays are smaller and weaker than solenoids and are usually only used to activate or hold switches to enable features and lights, or to release mechanisms that were activated by a solenoid (as in the <a href="http://funwithpinball.com/exhibits/small-boards-page-2#DisappearingPost">Disappearing Post</a>, <a href="#ZipperFlippers">Zipper Flippers</a> and others below).&nbsp; This board includes a simple relay, an interlocking relay which can stay in either position indefinitely without power, and a relay configured as a miniature stepper that turns a cam to open and close a switch.</p>

<h3><a id="PopBumpers" name="PopBumpers"></a>Pop Bumpers</h3>

<p>Perhaps the single most recognizable feature of a pinball machine, the Pop Bumper (or Jet Bumper) can kick a ball away that is approaching from any direction.</p>

</p>

<p>Pop Bumpers can fire several times per second and are too fast to easily discern the sequence of events.&nbsp; The version below uses a microcontroller and a couple of small motors to animate the pinball and pop bumper in slow motion.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="Flipper" name="Flipper"></a>Flippers</h3>

<p>While flippers appear on all pinball machines now they weren't invented until the late 1940s.&nbsp; Before then players had to nudge the ball around the playfield without tilting the game or rely on ball kickers that would only fire when the ball closed the appropriate switch.</p>

<p><a id="ZipperFlippers" name="ZipperFlippers"></a>Zipper Flippers work just like the <a href="#Flipper">Flipper</a> above but with the added feature that they can swing towards eachother to close the gap and prevent the ball from draining between them while remaining fully functional.&nbsp; They would open and close during the game based on which targets were hit.&nbsp; Zipper flippers were used on relatively few pinball machines.</p>

<h2><a id="Steppers" name="Steppers"></a>Steppers</h2>

<p>Steppers are used to step through a number of positions sequentially.&nbsp; They use ratcheting mechanisms to advance one step at a time and some use escapement mechanisms similar to those found in clocks to retract their steps either one step at a time, or all the way back to the beginning.</p>

<h3><a id="Stepper" name="Stepper"></a>Stepper Unit</h3>

<p>Stepper units are used to track features that step through a sequence as the game is played.&nbsp; For example the game might have several features that light up one at a time in order.&nbsp; This stepper is similar to the <a href="#ScoreReels">Score Reels</a> below because it advances one step at a time, in one direction only.&nbsp; It differs from the <a href="#CreditUnit">Credit Unit</a> and <a href="#BallCountUnit">Ball Count Unit</a> below because it can only advance; it cannot decrement or reset.</p>

<h3><a id="BallCountUnit" name="BallCountUnit"></a>Ball Count Unit</h3>

<p>The Ball Count Unit keeps track of how many balls the player has played.&nbsp; Lights wired to the Ball Count unit usually indicate the ball in play.&nbsp; The Ball Count Unit is another form of stepper that can step forward one step at a time or reset back to the beginning.&nbsp; It cannot decrement by one step like the <a href="#CreditUnit">Credit Unit</a> below.</p>

<h3><a id="CreditUnit" name="CreditUnit"></a>Credit Unit</h3>

<p>The Credit Unit keeps track of how many game credits the player has and is usually visible through a small window in the backglass.&nbsp; Coins and replays increase the total while each new game decreases the total.&nbsp; The credit unit is a form of stepper unit that can step both forward and backward one step at a time.</p>

<span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></span>
</p>

<p>The video below demonstrates the mechanism that limits the credit unit to one step at a time in either direction.&nbsp; This is done with mechanical lever arms activated by the increment and decrement solenoids.</p>

<p>It also reveals how the credit unit is electrically limited to a range of values (e.g. zero to 14 credits in this case).&nbsp; The video frame below shows two pins mounted to the dark grey gear which rotates to reflect the number of game credits.&nbsp; When there are zero credits remaining, the pin on left opens the two switches in the upper left corner to cut power to the decrement solenoid of the credit unit and to the new game circuit.&nbsp; In this state the credit unit will only allow the player to increment the credit count by winning a replay or depositing a coin.</p>

<p>Similarly, when a maximum number of credits is reached, the other pin (at the bottom of the frame below) opens the third switch which disables the increment solenoid of the credit unit.&nbsp; This prevents the credit unit from over winding.</p>

<h3><a id="ScoreReels" name="ScoreReels"></a>Score Reels</h3>

<p>Score reels are simple counters similar to mechanical odometers in older cars.&nbsp; Each reel can be advanced individually (to add 10 points, or 100 points for example), or advances when it's lower neighbor rolls over from 9 to 0 (from 89 to 90 for example).&nbsp; Each reel also has a separate reset circuit used at the start of a new game that lets it advance only until it reaches 0, where it stops.</p>

</p>

<p>The score reel video below shows how the 9 position and zero position switches open and close as the score reel advances.&nbsp; The 9 position switch is used to advance the next higher score reel and the zero position switch is used when resetting the score reel to 0.&nbsp; Most score reels have no way of knowing what digit is showing other than 0 and 9.</p>

</p>

<p>You may have noticed in the video that when a score reel resets to zero it advances its higher neighbor by one.&nbsp; This is not the normal behavior.&nbsp; A complete pinball machine has extra circuitry not present on this demonstration board to prevent this from happening.</p>

<h3><a id="ProjectionUnit" name="ProjectionUnit"></a>Projection Unit</h3>

<p>The Projection Unit was used to project the available game credits onto a frosted window on the backglass.&nbsp; Light from a bright bulb on the back of the unit shines through a pin hole, through the printed wheel, and through a focusing lens before reaching the glass.&nbsp; On this board the backglass is represented by a small piece of plastic held in a tube in front of the Projection Unit lens so the projection can be seen.</p>

<p>A predecessor to the <a href="#CreditUnit">Credit Unit</a> above, the Projection Unit was used in some games until the late 1940s.</p>

<h3><a id="SpinUnit" name="SpinUnit"></a>Spin Unit</h3>

<p>The Spin Unit is a clever way for the game to randomly change a game feature.&nbsp; Ordinarily steppers can only increment, decrement or reset.&nbsp; The Spin Unit is able to randomly change from any position to any other position.&nbsp; It does this by using a pair of steppers.&nbsp; The first, larger stepper is configured like a <a href="#BallCountUnit">Ball Count Unit</a>; it steps up one step at a time and can reset back to its starting position.&nbsp; During a game this stepper advances periodically as certain targets are hit or switches close.&nbsp; It also resets periodically when other targets are hit.</p>

<p>As the first stepper resets, the teardrop shaped board attached to its axle rotates and kicks the white spinner mounted above it.&nbsp; The spinner spins for an indeterminate number of revolutions, closing a switch once for each revolution.&nbsp; (The spinner mechanism is usually used on the playfield as a target that rewards points for each revolution.)</p>

<p>Each time the switch on the spinner closes, it sends a pulse to the second, smaller stepper which is configured as a simple <a href="#Stepper">Stepper</a> (with no decrement or reset).&nbsp; While the second stepper does advance a single step at a time, it advances a step for each revolution of the spinner which effectively randomizes its final resting position.</p>

<p>The number of steps the second stepper takes is loosely correlated to the number of steps the first stepper took before it kicked the spinner because each step on the first stepper winds its spring a little tighter and will make it kick the spinner a little harder.</p>

<pre><code>A long, long time ago
I can still remember how a protocol
used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those botnets dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But January made me shiver
With every packet I tried to deliver
Bad news on the backbone
I couldn't scan a single ASN

I can't remember if I cried
When my -f root hit an ACL line
But something touched me deep inside
The day the telnet died

So bye, bye mass spreading Mirai
Drove my SYNs down on the fiber line
But the fiber line was dry
And good old bots were passing creds in the clear and dry
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die</code></pre>
<p>On January 14, 2026, at approximately 21:00 UTC, something changed in the internet’s plumbing. The GreyNoise Global Observation Grid recorded a sudden, sustained collapse in global telnet traffic — not a gradual decline, not scanner attrition, not a data pipeline problem, but a step function. One hour, ~74,000 sessions. The next, ~22,000. By the following hour, we were down to ~11,000 and the floor held.</p>
<p>Six days later, on <a href="https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2026/q1/89">January 20</a>, the security advisory for CVE-2026-24061 hit oss-security. By <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2026/01/26/cisa-adds-five-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">January 26</a>, CISA had added it to the KEV catalog.</p>
<p>We wrote about the <a href="https://www.labs.greynoise.io/grimoire/2026-01-22-f-around-and-find-out-18-hours-of-unsolicited-houseguests/index.html">first 18 hours of exploitation activity</a> back on January 22. This post is about something different: the structural change in global telnet traffic that preceded the CVE, and why we think the two events may not be independent.</p>
<section id="the-drop">
<h2 data-anchor-id="the-drop">The Drop</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.labs.greynoise.io/grimoire/2026-02-10-telnet-falls-silent/media/asn-heatmap.png"></p>
<p>From December 1, 2025 through January 14, 2026, GreyNoise observed an average of ~914,000 non-spoofable telnet sessions per day across 51.2 million total sessions — let’s call that the “baseline”.</p>
<p>On January 14 at 21:00 UTC, hourly volume dropped 65% in a single tick. Within two hours it had fallen 83% below baseline. The new average settled around ~373,000 sessions/day — a <strong>59% sustained reduction</strong> that persists through the time of writing (February 10).</p>
<p>This wasn’t a taper. The hourly data around the inflection point tells the story:</p>

<p>That kind of step function — propagating within a single hour window — reads as a configuration change on routing infrastructure, not behavioral drift in scanning populations.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-went-silent">
<h2 data-anchor-id="what-went-silent">What Went Silent</h2>
<p>Eighteen ASNs with significant pre-drop telnet volume (&gt;50K sessions each) went to absolute zero after January 15. Some of the names that stand out:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vultr</strong> (AS20473) — 382K pre-drop sessions, then nothing</li>
<li><strong>Cox Communications</strong> (AS22773) — 150K sessions, gone</li>
<li><strong>Charter/Spectrum</strong> (AS20115) — 141K sessions, gone</li>
<li><strong>BT/British Telecom</strong> (AS2856) — 127K sessions, gone</li>
</ul>
<p>Five entire countries vanished from GreyNoise telnet data: Zimbabwe, Ukraine, Canada, Poland, and Egypt. Not reduced — <em>zero</em>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the major cloud providers were largely unaffected or even increased. AWS went <em>up</em> 78%. Contabo <em>up</em> 90%. DigitalOcean essentially flat at +3%. Cloud providers have extensive private peering at major IXPs that bypasses traditional transit backbone paths. Residential and enterprise ISPs typically don’t.</p>
</section>
<section id="wheres-the-filter">
<h2 data-anchor-id="wheres-the-filter">Where’s the Filter?</h2>
<p>The pattern points toward one or more North American Tier 1 transit providers implementing port 23 filtering:</p>
<p>The timing — 21:00 UTC, which is 16:00 EST — is consistent with a US-based maintenance window. US residential ISPs (Cox, Charter, Comcast at -74%) were devastated while cloud providers on the same continent peered around whatever changed. Verizon/UUNET (AS701) dropped 79%, and as a major Tier 1 backbone, that’s consistent with it either being the filtering entity or sitting directly upstream of one. The 21% residual traffic on AS701 would represent paths that don’t transit the filtered links.</p>
<p>Countries that rely on transatlantic or transpacific backbone routes to reach US-hosted infrastructure got hit hardest. Countries with strong direct European peering (France at +18%, Germany at -1%) were essentially unaffected.</p>
<p>The Chinese backbone providers (China Telecom and China Unicom) both dropped ~59%, uniformly. That uniformity suggests the filter sits on the US side of transpacific links rather than within China. If this were a Chinese firewall action, we’d expect asymmetric impact across Chinese carriers and a harder cutoff.</p>
</section>
<section id="then-came-the-cve">
<h2 data-anchor-id="then-came-the-cve">Then Came the CVE</h2>
<p>CVE-2026-24061 is a critical (CVSS 9.8) authentication bypass in GNU Inetutils telnetd. The flaw is an argument injection in how telnetd handles the <code>USER</code> environment variable during telnet option negotiation. An attacker sends <code>-f root</code> as the username value, and <code>login(1)</code> obediently skips authentication, handing over a root shell. No credentials required. No user interaction. The vulnerable code was introduced in a 2015 commit and sat undiscovered for nearly 11 years.</p>

<p>The six-day gap between the telnet drop and the public CVE disclosure is the interesting part. On its face, the drop can’t have been <em>caused</em> by the CVE disclosure, because the drop happened first. But “caused by” isn’t the only relationship worth considering.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-supposition">
<h2 data-anchor-id="the-supposition">The Supposition</h2>
<p>Responsible disclosure timelines don’t start at publication. The researcher who found this (<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/critical-gnu-inetutils-telnetd-flaw.html">credited as Kyu Neushwaistein / Carlos Cortes Alvarez</a>) reported the flaw on January 19, per public sources. But the coordination that leads to patches being ready, advisories being drafted, and CISA being prepared to add something to the KEV within six days of publication typically starts earlier than the day before disclosure.</p>
<p>Here’s what we think may have happened: advance notification of a trivially exploitable, unauthenticated root-access vulnerability affecting telnet daemons reached parties with the ability to act on it at the infrastructure level. A backbone or transit provider — possibly responding to a coordinated request, possibly acting on their own assessment — implemented port 23 filtering on transit links. The filtering went live on January 14. The public disclosure followed on January 20.</p>
<p>This would explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>The timing gap (advance notification → infrastructure response → public disclosure)</li>
<li>The specificity of the filtering (port 23/TCP, not a general routing change)</li>
<li>The topology of impact (transit-dependent paths affected, direct-peering paths not)</li>
<li>The sustained nature (the filter is still in place weeks later)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can’t prove this. The backbone drop could be entirely coincidental — ISPs have been slowly moving toward filtering legacy insecure protocols for years (ref: Wannacry), and January 14 could simply have been when someone’s change control ticket finally got executed. Correlation, temporal proximity, and a plausible mechanism <em>absolutely do not</em> equal causation.</p>
<p>But the combination of a Tier 1 backbone implementing what appears to be port 23 filtering, followed six days later by the disclosure of a trivially exploitable root-access telnet vulnerability, followed four days after <em>that</em> by a CISA KEV listing, is worth documenting and considering.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-the-post-drop-world-looks-like">
<h2 data-anchor-id="what-the-post-drop-world-looks-like">What the Post-Drop World Looks Like</h2>
<p>The telnet landscape after January 14 shows a recurring sawtooth pattern — periodic spikes followed by troughs (e.g., January 28 at 806K sessions, then January 30 at 191K). This could indicate intermittent filter application, routing flaps around the filtering infrastructure, or scanner campaigns that happen to use paths not affected by the filter.</p>
<p>The weekly averages tell the sustained story:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Week Starting</th>
<th>Avg Daily Sessions</th>
<th>% of Baseline</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Dec 01</td>
<td>1,086,744</td>

<p>We’re now operating at roughly a third of the pre-drop baseline, and the trend is still slightly downward.</p>
</section>
<section id="practical-implications">
<h2 data-anchor-id="practical-implications">Practical Implications</h2>
<p>If you’re running GNU Inetutils telnetd anywhere — and given the 11-year window, there are plenty of embedded systems, network appliances, and legacy Linux installations where it’s still likely present — patch to version 2.7-2 or later, or disable the service entirely. The CISA KEV remediation deadline for federal agencies is February 16, 2026. As noted, GreyNoise observed exploitation attempts <a href="https://www.labs.greynoise.io/grimoire/2026-01-22-f-around-and-find-out-18-hours-of-unsolicited-houseguests/index.html">within hours of disclosure</a> and the campaign peaked at ~2,600 sessions/day in early February before tapering off.</p>
<p>If you’re a network operator and you haven’t already filtered port 23 at your border, the backbone-level filtering we’ve documented here suggests the industry is moving in that direction regardless. Someone upstream of a significant chunk of the internet’s transit infrastructure apparently decided telnet traffic isn’t worth carrying anymore. That’s probably the right call.</p>
