<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="issue-body-viewer" data-team-hovercards-enabled="true" data-turbolinks="false" id="issue-body-viewer"><p dir="auto">We've seen a slight uptick in pull-requests and bug reports which appear to be LLM-generated, so it's probably about time to come to a decision on what we should and should not accept and document this somewhere (presumably in <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">My personal opinion is we shouldn't accept anything LLM-generated, but this is probably not the common position of most @opencontainers/runc-maintainers, so we should probably consider LLM-generated code and issues separately.</p>
<p dir="auto">IMHO, we should close all LLM-generated <strong>issues</strong> as spam, because even if they are describing real issues the entire issue description contains so much unneeded (and probably incorrect) information that it'd be better if they just provided their LLM prompt as an issue instead. More importantly, when triaging bugs we have to assume that what the user has written did actually happen to them, but with LLM-generated issues -- who knows whether the description is actually describing something real? (See <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="3601043967" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4982" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/opencontainers/runc/issues/4982/hovercard" href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4982">#4982</a> and <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="3596160805" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4972" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/opencontainers/runc/issues/4972/hovercard" href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4972">#4972</a> as possible examples of LLM-generated bug reports.)</p>
<p dir="auto">For LLM-generated code, I think the minimum bar should be that the submitter needs to be able to respond to review requests in their own words (i.e., they understand what their patch does and was able to write the code themselves). (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="3520172250" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4940" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/opencontainers/runc/pull/4940/hovercard" href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4940">#4940</a> and <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="3520138917" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4939" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/opencontainers/runc/pull/4939/hovercard" href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4939">#4939</a> was the most recent example of this I can think of, and I'm not convinced the submitter would've cleared this bar.)</p>
<p dir="auto">(FWIW, my view is that LLM-generated code cannot fulfil the requirements of the DCO and so we shouldn't accept it for the legal reasons alone, but I appreciate this is a minority view.)</p>

    <p>November 05, 2025 • work, economics, automation</p>
  </header>
  <p>I have been putting off writing this for a month, mostly because I did everything I was supposed to do and it still feels like I have no idea what game I am actually playing.</p>

<p>I went to university. I got good grades. I did three internships. I ran a tiny consultancy for a while, building things for people and sending invoices that were actually paid. I studied computer science. I have done the very normal, very legible technical work you put on a CV: I learned the tools I was told to learn. I watched the right talks. I followed the right people. I can point at a neat little row of experiences and say: I played by the rules you told me about.</p>

<p>I am unemployed anyway.</p>

<p>I have been applying around as a new grad, sending out the same careful batch of CVs and cover letters that older friends used a few years ago to land solid jobs. What I meet instead is a job market that people now casually call broken. The phrase “white collar recession” has escaped into the mainstream. Articles talk about a graduate jobpocalypse and the disappearance of entry level roles just as the largest cohorts of students emerge from university. Computer science, which was marketed for years as the safest degree in the room, now shows up in headlines as one of the majors with the highest unemployment. People in my cohort are not confused about this the group chat tone is not a bit of a rough patch but this market is cooked.</p>

<p>On the official dashboards unemployment is still low, which is what older people tend to quote back at you. From the ground the thing feels different. The postings are there, the interview loops still exist, recruiters still send polite rejections. It is the density of opportunity that has changed. There are more people stacked against fewer real openings, and the default advice of “just apply to more places” lands differently when you know you are running through the same funnel as thousands of other people who also did everything right.</p>

<p>When you talk to older people, including many who are sympathetic, they often reach for familiar explanations first. Rates went up. Funding dried out. The last decade of cheap money was a sugar rush. The current US administration is running a particular mix of trade and industrial policy. These are all real. High interest rates do kill hiring sprees. Entire departments exist today mostly because capital was cheap three years ago. But behind that cycle there is something else, less visible in the graphs and much more visible if you are twenty something and trying to get your first proper job at exactly the moment capital has discovered that software and robots and offshore labour can be stacked together.</p>

<p>A decade ago people passed around a famous paper that said roughly half of American jobs were at high risk of computerisation over the following couple of decades. It was quoted so often that it turned into a kind of folk memory; a big, scary claim that sat behind every newspaper headline about robots taking work. The follow up work was much less memorable. When the OECD re-did the exercise at the level of tasks rather than whole occupations, the share of jobs flagged as “high risk” shrank to a much smaller slice, and later work showed that employment in those supposedly fragile occupations still grew, just more slowly than elsewhere. Automation as actually measured looked more like a slow pressure on certain kinds of work and wages than a cliff edge.</p>

<p>That slow pressure matters. Industrial robots in the United States have already been associated with sizeable job losses and clear wage falls in the regions where they were deployed. The OECD data shows that occupations with more routine, codifiable tasks have grown less and paid worse than occupations that rely more on social skill or physical presence. This is a story about composition, about how many of the jobs created are in fields people can actually enter and live on. The headline unemployment rate can stay low while a particular cohort feels like they are pushing against a wall that gets a little harder every year.</p>

<p>If you sit where I sit, as a new grad with a half decent CV and a browser full of ghosted applications, that gradual statistical story does not quite capture the feeling. What it feels like is that the entry corridor has narrowed, and that the bar for being worth a salary at all is moving faster than people want to admit. It feels like you are competing not just with other humans, which would be fine, but with the entire past of the economy: every dataset, every process flow someone has written down, every recording of someone doing the work you are trying to get paid for.</p>

<p>The Amazon story is a useful place to stare at this without drifting into science fiction. Leaked internal planning documents and external analyst notes have sketched out a future in which Amazon replaces a large share of warehouse tasks with robotics over the next decade and saves eye watering sums in the process. The company disputes some of the job loss projections, points to new roles created, and likes to say that robots help humans rather than replace them. It is probably sincere and even correct in some places. It is also true that Amazon has quietly expanded its robot fleet to a huge number of units while overall headcount in the most automated centres has flattened or fallen.</p>

<p>What interests me is not just the robots, but the quiet rewrite of the rule that sits under them. For most of the industrial era, you could assume that any large physical operation, like a warehouse, would need a certain number of human bodies to move boxes and drive forklifts. Human labour was a kind of fixed ingredient. You might squeeze wage rates or offshore some tasks, but you did not start your business model by asking whether you could avoid hiring people at all. Amazon and other firms like it are now encouraged by shareholders and banks to ask that question first. Not how do we run this warehouse with people, but how many people can we get away with and where can we put them so that they add marginal value on top of systems that coast on software and steel.</p>

<p>Teleoperation makes this even stranger. A surprising amount of so called automation today is really labour that has been routed through a screen. There are Filipino workers sitting in offices in Manila wearing VR headsets, remotely steering shelf stocking robots through Japanese convenience stores. There are people in one country sitting at desks, driving forklifts in another country using multi screen setups and a steering wheel, stepping in only when the semi autonomous software gets confused. Security robots patrol office corridors with a remote human ready to take over through a tablet whenever anything looks off.</p>

<p>It feels like immigration without immigrants. The rich country gets the labour it wants at a wage that looks more like Manila than Tokyo, but nobody has to build new housing, merge school systems, negotiate over culture or passports. On the rich side, it can be sold as productivity, which plays well politically. On the worker side, it is another rung in the long ladder that runs from call centres to business process outsourcing to micro task platforms. The worker is still human, still fallible, still earning just enough to keep going, but geographically they are treated more like part of the network than part of the town.</p>

<p>There is another twist, which is that these teleoperated jobs rarely stand still. A lot of them exist not just to get the work done, but to collect data so that the work can later be done without the human at all. Humanoid projects make this explicit. Neo, a household robot that went viral this year, spends a lot of its actual working time in an “expert mode” where a remote operator pilots it through chores, opening doors and picking up objects. The company then uses those sessions to train its own control model, using both successes and failures as data. Tesla’s Optimus is being taught in a similar way; workers wear rigs and repeatedly grasp cups or wipe tables so that the resulting recordings can be used as samples for the robot to imitate.</p>

<p>This is familiar if you watched what happened with data work for self driving cars and large language models. Scale AI started around 2016 with hordes of people labelling images and LiDAR frames for autonomous vehicle companies. Within a few years those labels fed into perception systems and then into foundation models for driving, and the work that was once scattered across many companies as internal grunt work was mostly concentrated with a handful of providers. Teleoperation feels like the embodied version of that. The immediate job is to keep the warehouse or the road running. The secondary job is to produce training data so that the next generation of robots and models will need fewer of you. Ghost work in the physical world.</p>

<p>I am not the person in the VR rig or in the forklift chair. My world is the white collar side of this, the part where the work happens in code editors, notebooks, documents and meetings. The pattern rhymes. Over the past couple of years you can watch entry level roles thin out in tech, finance, consulting and similar fields that used to soak up computer science graduates. Reports talking about a white collar recession and about entry level jobs disappearing just as the largest cohorts of graduates hit the market. Computer science, once the safest bet in the room, now shows up in stories as one of the degrees with the worst employment outcomes, which would have sounded like a joke not long ago.</p>

<p>You can see the shape of it in small ways. Entry level job boards that used to be full of junior developer roles now skew toward mid level and senior. Graduate schemes quietly cut their intake and companies push harder on automation and AI tooling instead. Employers tell journalists that they are holding back on junior hiring and prefer to lean on experienced staff plus AI tools, or simply automate parts of the work that would once have gone to juniors so they do not need to open the req at all. The ladder is still there, but it has lost a few rungs, and the remaining rungs sit above a seething pile of people who all did what they were told.</p>

<p>There is a tight relationship here with the way humans and software scale. Humans have always had some narrow horizontal scaling. A good operator could, in most cases, cover more than one vehicle if they were in the right geometry. Supervisors can coordinate teams. A single person with good tools can now keep an eye on several semi autonomous robots, or fleets of trucks, or a room full of humanoids, intervening only when something weird happens. Software takes this logic and stretches it until it breaks the category. Once you have a strong model, you can copy it into as many agents as you can afford to run. Read the current run of agent papers and demos and you see systems built from many copies of the same underlying model, set up to argue with each other, negotiate, plan and execute as little societies. In that world the baseline worker is not a person and not even a single bot but a swarm of cloned minds sharing memory.</p>

<p>Managers are starting to adjust their habits around that. There are already public memos from large companies where leaders tell their staff that any request for headcount has to come with a justification for why an AI system cannot do the job. Shopify’s chief executive talked this way when he told teams to try AI first before asking for more people. Some firms that used to keep small armies of contractors now advertise themselves as “AI first” and quietly shrink the human pool while their products shift more tasks onto models. It is not that nobody gets hired at all. Certain roles are still snapped up. It is that the default answer has flipped. The question is no longer whether a model can cover the job that was going to exist anyway. The question is whether a human can justify their presence next to a stack of models.</p>

<p>This is where I keep coming back to a phrase that has been rattling around my brain for the past month: out of distribution humans.</p>

<p>Most work lives in the fat middle of a bell curve. Tasks repeat with small variations. Most graduate schemes are built around that fact. You take reasonably bright people, give them a handbook and a mentor, and let them climb a well mapped gradient. Shared service centres, call centres, warehouses, junior consulting rotations, entry level software roles, even a lot of legal and accounting work, all sit in that comfortable hunk of the curve where yesterday’s data is a very good guide to tomorrow’s tasks.</p>

<p>Models feast on that part of the curve. That is what they are trained on: logs, emails, historical cases, recordings of someone else doing the job, code repositories, scanned documents. If your work looks a lot like a large pile of past episodes, it is a short hop from playing them back to imitating them. The central question for future labour markets is not whether you are clever or diligent in some absolute sense. It is whether what you do is ordinary enough for a model to learn or strange enough to fall through the gaps.</p>

<p>An out of distribution human, in my head, is someone whose job sits far enough in the tail of that curve that it does not currently compress into training data. Maybe they work with genuinely novel problems. Maybe they operate at small scales or in messy physical situations where we do not yet have enough sensors. Maybe they have taste that is not easily reduced to click logs. They are not safe; nothing is. They are simply late on the automation curve. The system needs them until it can watch them for long enough and in enough detail that it can flatten what they do into data.</p>

<p>The obvious problem is that most people, including most conscientious, capable new grads, are not doing anything like that. Most of us are trying to get into the middle of the curve, into the part of the labour market that has historically been considered sensible and respectable. My three internships were not wild experiments. They were exactly the kinds of things you do when you are aiming for a normal job: some engineering, some product, some research. The consultancy I ran was tiny and real, but it lived on predictable work. That was the point I was building a CV that sat neatly in the centre of the distribution, because that was where the jobs were.</p>

<p>Now it feels like the centre is being hollowed out. Employers are still very happy to talk about skills and effort, but the quiet question under everything is: is your contribution weird enough that we cannot paste it together from a few agents and a cheaper worker in another country. If the answer is no, then even when you do get hired you have to live with the knowledge that your day job is essentially a labelling job. You are adding examples to the pile that will train your future replacement. Out of distribution humans are the ones who manage to stay just far enough ahead of the pile for long enough to have a career.</p>

<p>The political reaction to this has not caught up. The industrial nations of the twentieth century were built around the idea that work was the organising principle of life. Catholic social teaching talked about the dignity of labour. Socialist movements sang about the worker as a hero. Protestant infused capitalism turned productivity into a route to salvation. Even the centrist stripe of postwar politics treated a job as the main vehicle through which adults were meant to find status, income and a place in the world. This hung around through the neoliberal years, even as manufacturing shrank and services expanded. You can hear it every time someone from any mainstream party talks about “hard working families”.</p>

<p>The result is that a lot of our institutions still act as if giving everyone a job is the primary goal, long after the underlying economic logic has started to drift. You can see it in the way some regions subsidise employment programmes that barely produce anything useful, or insist that people physically come in to do tasks that could be handled in far leaner ways. You can see it in the zombie jobs that exist mostly so that a local unemployment statistic looks less embarrassing. You can see it in small things like states that keep petrol pump attendants around in an age where self service is trivial, just to keep people on the payroll and maintain a social script about service. These are not vast conspiracies but instead residual behaviour of a world that treated labour as sacred.</p>

<p>Unions sit in the middle of this. They have in some cases slowed automation in ways that probably preserved wages and bargaining power for longer than markets would have allowed. Metro lines in Europe run with drivers even though driverless lines exist in the same city and have been proven technically viable. Port workers have fought hard to restrict automated cranes and remote controls, sometimes winning explicit clauses that bar certain kinds of automation for the life of a contract. Strikes that shut down whole systems have been used as leverage to negotiate over the future of jobs that could in principle be done with much less human involvement.</p>

<p>There is a strange symmetry here. On one side you have firms quietly routing labour through screens and robots, and repeating that jobs will be fine on aggregate. On the other you have unions and politicians insisting that jobs must be preserved, even when that means attaching people to tasks that are technically obsolete. Neither camp really articulates what it would mean for work itself to shrink as a central organising story. They just fight over where the remaining jobs will be and who will do them.</p>

<p>If you want to see how far this can go without the sky falling, you look at places that have already pushed automation hard. The International Federation of Robotics statistic tables are slightly dry, but they tell a simple story. South Korea, Singapore, Japan and Germany have been packing industrial robots into their factories at a remarkable rate for years. China started later, then began installing new units at such a pace that it now accounts for more than half of global industrial robot installations and has overtaken Germany in robot density in manufacturing. At the same time, China’s GDP per capita by purchasing power parity is still maybe a third of that of the United States, and its youth unemployment has lurched upwards, with official figures in recent years hovering in the mid to high teens and unofficial estimates higher.</p>

<p>So you have a giant country that has thrown money and policy at automation, packed factories full of robots, tied itself into global supply chains, and still produced a generation of graduates who complain on social media about “rotting” in low paid service jobs or online hustle work. You have very visible memes about lying flat and giving up on the competition game. You have an official narrative about hi tech growth that is not exactly false, but feels distant from the daily experience of a twenty three year old with a degree and no good offers.</p>

<p>The gig economy in the United States and Europe is another small window into this. Robotaxis are still barely a rounding error in total miles driven. Waymo carries a trivial share of all rides in the cities where it operates. Yet if you talk to ride hail drivers in San Francisco or Phoenix, you hear anxiety that grows faster than the fleet. Data from driver apps already shows earnings slipping in markets where robotaxis operate even though their absolute presence is small, and banks have issued notes warning that urban ride hail platforms face “AV risk” as robotaxi coverage expands. The job loss story gets there before the job loss itself.</p>

<p>This is the pattern that worries me more than the big forecast numbers. The technical line is that automation is a slow, uneven pressure; that jobs appear as well as disappear; that productivity can even raise wages in the long run. The lived line for my cohort is that the good jobs at the centre of the curve are thinning out, that junior entry points are being quietly closed, and that we are being told to somehow mutate into outliers while competing with systems that learn from everything we do.</p>

<p>I do not know how many jobs will exist in twenty years, or whether my own work will sit far enough into the tail of the distribution to matter. I will certainly try to become an out of distribution human by doing a lot of different things, and by refusing to live entirely in the centre of the curve but if your entire life plan rests on being a respectable, central case worker, doing a standard job in a standard company, I think you should at least stare straight at how much effort is going into eroding that category. If your politics rest on the idea that everyone will work full time and find dignity there, you should stare at it too. The twentieth century spent a lot of intellectual and moral effort glorifying labour because economies needed people to show up every day. The twenty-first century is starting to build machines and systems that do not need quite as many of us.</p>

<p>Tesla has engaged in a pattern of taking credit for the successes of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, even though the car still relies on an attentive driver, and yet blaming the driver rather than the software whenever things go badly.</p>



<p>But new moves towards allowing more distracted driving could make it harder for the company to blame drivers when its software fails.</p>



<p>Tesla has been marketing some version of its Autopilot or FSD software since 2013. Ever since then, the company has made bold pronouncements about how rapidly the software would improve, stating almost continually that fully autonomous driving would come <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_predictions_for_autonomous_Tesla_vehicles_by_Elon_Musk">within a year</a>.</p>



<p>Autopilot and FSD have changed definitions over time, with basic Autopilot initially being an option and now being included on most vehicles, and with FSD being an additional cost on top of that, at varying prices (costing <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/09/05/tesla-raises-full-self-driving-price-to-15000-is-it-worth-it/">up to $15,000</a> at one point).</p>	
	



<p>In general, Autopilot has promised to be a driver’s aid, while FSD has promised to allow the car to fully drive itself with no human intervention when the software is finally ready.</p>



<p>That fully autonomous ability has yet to be delivered, but Tesla’s software does continue to improve.</p>



<p>At first Autopilot was merely active on highways, as soft of a “smart cruise control” system. It could hold the car in a lane and track the speed of vehicles ahead and match them.</p>



<p>Over time the systems have gained more capabilities, including being able to follow the car’s navigation system and take highway interchanges on its own. And throughout all this time, colloquially Teslas have very often been referred to as “self-driving cars.”</p>



<p>FSD can now operate not just on highways, but on surface streets. It is possible to do certain drives without a human touching the steering wheel – but a driver must always be in the driver’s seat and paying attention to the road (and Tesla <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/05/27/tesla-releases-driver-monitoring-system-cabin-camera/">will monitor you to make sure you’re doing so</a>). </p>



<h2 id="h-a-quick-primer-on-autonomous-drive-systems">A quick primer on autonomous drive systems</h2>



<p>This is because both Autopilot and FSD, and every software version of them that has so far been released, fall under the same high-level classification of autonomous drive systems. They’re all “Level 2” drive systems, according to the <a href="https://www.sae.org/news/blog/sae-levels-driving-automation-clarity-refinements">SAE levels of driving automation</a>.</p>



<p>All driving automation systems are ranked from level 0-5. With level 0-2 systems, drivers are responsible for everything the car does. With a level 3 system, the car can be considered responsible at some times, and with level 4 or 5 systems, the car is always responsible.</p>



<p>There is one level 3 system available in the US, <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/09/27/hands-off-with-the-first-true-hands-free-car-in-the-us-and-its-not-tesla/">Mercedes DRIVE PILOT</a>, which can be used in narrow circumstances to let the car drive for you. And autonomous <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/10/08/waymos-driverless-taxi-tested-perfect-chaos-venice-beach-weekend/">driverless taxis like Waymo </a>are level 4 systems, with no driver but the ability only to operate in certain situations or areas (<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/06/25/whoopsie-uh-oh-oh-my-heres-all-the-gaffes-and-goofs-by-tesla-robotaxi-so-far/">Tesla’s Robotaxi</a> is purportedly similar to Waymo, but due to the presence of a “safety monitor,” it is arguably level 2, since an operator is still in the vehicle, just not in the driver’s seat).</p>



<p>But Tesla’s promises about FSD would put it squarely into the “level 5” category. CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly stated that FSD will eventually be able to drive the car across the country with nobody in it, such that your car could be in New York and you could ask it to come pick you up in Los Angeles. That ability has not yet been delivered though, so we’re still in level 2 territory.</p>



<h2 id="h-tesla-likes-to-crow-about-fsd-s-improvements">Tesla likes to crow about FSD’s improvements</h2>



<p>Tesla proclaims quite often that its FSD system is better than human drivers, and that its level of safety is increasing over time.</p>



<p>It often releases data showing the number of miles between crashes, comparing miles driven by humans and miles driven by FSD. In Tesla’s released numbers, miles driven by FSD are safer than those driven by humans.</p>



<p>That’s not the whole story though, because the data is somewhat cherry picked. A real study on safety would attempt to rule out extraneous variables that could influence the results, and as of yet, Tesla has not conducted a robust study of that manner (in contrast, Waymo has released <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/12/19/study-waymos-robotaxi-provides-higher-safety-performance-than-human-drivers/">multiple</a> <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/12/20/waymo-says-its-self-driving-cars-are-safer-than-human-drivers-by-up-to-10x/">studies</a> conducted through <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.01206">outside entities</a>).</p>



<p>There is also some difference between Tesla-provided numbers and <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/09/26/tesla-full-self-driving-third-party-testing-13-miles-between-interventions/">third-party numbers</a>, showing that Tesla’s “miles between interventions” is <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/06/elon-musk-approved-tesla-full-self-driving-dataset-doubled-whats-the-state-of-fsd-now/">relatively low</a>. This is thought of as a key indicator of how close a system is to being level 4-5 capable, as ideally a self-driving car should be able to go tens of thousands of miles without needing a human to come fix something.</p>



<p>Tesla did provide <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/11/06/elon-musk-tesla-fsd-allow-texting-and-driving-month-two/">a new update on data</a> at this week’s <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/11/06/tesla-tsla-shareholders-shoot-selves-in-foot-approve-musk-1-trillion-payday/">shareholder meeting</a>, again showing that FSD miles result in far fewer accidents than other modes of driving. Though that update again doesn’t provide the robust data that a real study would, and indeed, Tesla’s own numbers show a <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/10/22/teslas-autopilot-safety-data-is-getting-worse/">reduction in safety over the course of this year.</a></p>



<p>And in fact, none of these numbers provided by Tesla ever describe just how safe FSD is on its own. All of them rely on the combined safety of both FSD <em>and</em> a human driver at the same time, as humans are required to be in the seat while operating the vehicle. When that human co-driver is moved to the passenger seat and called a safety monitor, <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/10/29/tesla-robotaxis-keep-crashing-despite-safety-monitors/">safety numbers plummet</a>.</p>



<p>So Tesla frames FSD data in a positive light, but what about when something bad happens?</p>



<h2 id="h-tesla-blames-drivers-when-its-systems-fail">Tesla blames drivers when its systems fail</h2>



<p>When there’s an accident associated with its driver-assistance systems, Tesla will be the first to claim that it had nothing to do with it, and that the driver is at fault.</p>



<p>This is technically true. If FSD and Autopilot are level 2 systems, then the driver is responsible for everything the car is doing. And drivers must accept an agreement in the car before activating these systems acknowledging that they must pay attention to the road at all times and are responsible for what the car does even when the systems are activated.</p>



<p>So, for example, when a Florida driver on Autopilot drops his phone and blows through a stop sign, hitting a car which then hits two pedestrians,<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/01/victims-of-tesla-autopilot-crash-are-seeking-345-million-in-damages/"> killing one</a>, Tesla will claim “this driver was solely at fault.” In that case, a judge agreed that the driver was mostly at fault, but still assigned 33% of blame to Tesla, resulting in a <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/01/tesla-tsla-is-found-liable-in-fatal-autopilot-crash-has-to-pay-329-million/">$243 million judgment against the company</a>.</p>



<p>Part of the reason that case was decided as it was was due to Musk’s constant statements about Autopilot and FSD’s abilities. After spending so many years talking up Tesla’s self-driving abilities, it is common for drivers and the general public to think that Tesla cars “drive themselves.” But Tesla said that those statements <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/29/tesla-asks-court-to-throw-out-243-million-verdict-in-fatal-autopilot-crash-case/">shouldn’t have been heard at the case at all</a>, again wanting to make this failure about the driver, not about Autopilot.</p>



<p>The judgment was also influenced by Tesla’s <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/04/tesla-withheld-data-lied-misdirected-police-plaintiffs-avoid-blame-autopilot-crash/">withholding of data</a>, which tracks with the company’s aforementioned refusal to submit its FSD data to robust outside scientific study.</p>



<p>Tesla has <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/04/21/tesla-settles-another-wrongful-death-lawsuit-implications/">settled other similar cases</a> before they went to trial, paying out large sums to keep discussion of Autopilot safety out of court. But it refused to settle the Florida case, which <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/08/26/tesla-kept-its-promise-not-to-settle-it-cost-the-company-an-extra-183-million/">may have been a strategic mistake</a>.</p>



<p>So we have a contradiction here: when Tesla’s systems do well, Tesla takes all the credit, even though there’s a driver in the driver’s seat. But when they do poorly, Tesla does what it can to obscure causes or to blame drivers (who, to be fair, are still tasked with operating the vehicle, despite Musk’s many hopeful statements about self-driving). It’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger's_cat">Schrödinger’s FSD</a>: responsible when Tesla wants it to be, but not when Tesla doesn’t want it to be.</p>



<p>But that might change going forward.</p>



<h2 id="h-tesla-s-move-away-from-driver-monitoring-could-open-it-up-to-more-liability">Tesla’s move away from driver monitoring could open it up to more liability</h2>



<p>So, Tesla has heretofore managed to dodge responsibility for many of FSD’s problems by alleging that the driver is responsible at all times. And it’s not wrong to point this out.</p>



<p>However, at this week’s shareholder meeting, Musk stated that Tesla may allow “texting and driving” within “a month or two.”</p>



<p>What he seemed to be referring to is Tesla’s in-car driver monitoring system, which tracks driver attention using a camera near the rear-view mirror. If the system notices that you’re looking away from the road for too long, it will warn you and then deactivate FSD and make you take over driving for yourself, to ensure you’re doing your job as a driver.</p>



<p>Musk said that the issue with this is that many people want to text and drive anyway, and so will turn off FSD so they can send a text, then turn it back on after the fact. Musk alleges that it would be safer for those drivers to text and drive with FSD on than having it off, so Tesla might as well go ahead and update the software to allow for this soon.</p>



<p>But an unintended consequence of this could be that future court cases could use Tesla’s overconfidence in this matter against the company, claiming that it wasn’t doing its job to ensure driver attention. Despite claiming that drivers are always in control of the vehicle, Musk has now told drivers that it’s okay to take their eyes off the road – and the car won’t do anything to stop you from doing so, either.</p>



<p>And as we saw in the Florida case, Musk’s public statements were a part of the case. So Musk’s now-overconfidence about letting drivers text and drive could certainly show up in a courtroom in the future.</p>



<p>The use of driver monitoring for court cases is also of specific interest to Musk, as in the past he has floated the idea that <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/09/15/musk-wanted-to-use-tesla-cameras-to-spy-on-drivers-and-win-autopilot-lawsuits/">Tesla should spy on drivers</a> with the in-car camera and use those recordings to prevail in Autopilot crash cases. Tesla’s lawyers shut this idea down at the time.</p>




	<p>But now, moving forward, that doesn’t even matter. The CEO has stated that cars will be updated supposedly within a month or two to allow you to look away from the road. There would be no purpose to recording drivers for lack of attention, because Tesla will supposedly allow drivers to look away freely.</p>



<p>And even if drivers agree to always pay attention, if Tesla is giving them features that specifically encourage them <em>not to</em>, and those features are framed explicitly by the CEO to encourage illegal eyes-off-road activity, we think the company might have a much harder time playing its “Schrödinger’s FSD” game in court going forward.</p>

- swim lap counter in html/JS that uses the camera to watch you swim and count laps/timing
- video recorder that records your window/desktop and uploads a file to S3
- video conferencing app that allows a 2 year to click on a family member face and initiates a video conference using webRTC, STUN, and browser audio/video capture with automatic bandwidth adjustments (works on all platforms with pure HTML/JS).
- CUDA based ray tracer with HTML UI that can trace over 2m rays per second on my laptop for scientific study, allowing real-time display of optical parts.
- chat front-end for image models like gemini-pro and openai that take other images and text as references and generate a big library of options to chose from in seconds, I've been using photoshop for decades but I tend to use this more now.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45870748"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45870748" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45870748&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45869146"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>A tool for creating custom Tailwind-style color palettes for web and UI design that pass WCAG contrast requirements:</p><p><a href="https://www.inclusivecolors.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.inclusivecolors.com/</a></p><p>The interface is optimized to let you quickly explore and tweak multiple tints/shades at once so you can customize all colors exactly how you want e.g. try dragging vertically through the saturation curve in one motion to edit all the tints/shades at once, or shift whole curves horizontally by dragging between the dots on a curve.</p><p>It uses the HSLuv color space, where (unlike say HSL) the WCAG contrast stays the same when you change the hue and saturation sliders. This makes it much easier to explore accessible colors choices as you know only changes to the lightness slider will impact the contrast. You can also switch from the WCAG2 contrast checker to using APCA, which is meant to correct for inaccuracies in WCAG2, such as it being too forgiving for dark mode color combos.</p><p>Note the mobile version is more of a preview and the desktop version has more features.</p><p>I probably need to add something like a tutorial as there's  a lot going on, but I've added more hints and tooltips recently.

I did physiotherapy for years and while it helped me manage pain, I was never able to truly build enough strength to get ahead of it until I started bouldering.

Initially, I would only go on Saturday mornings, so I had the full weekend to recover before jumping back into the work week on Monday. After a two or three months of that, I was able to climb anytime I wished.

<div><p><a href="https://easel.games/" rel="nofollow">https://easel.games</a></p><p>I'm making Easel, a 2D game programming language designed to match how humans, not computers, think about game logic. It also has automatic multiplayer. I've been working on it for 3 years!</p><p>Easel feels like a declarative programming language even though it is imperative, because lots of useful game-oriented features are first class. Like behaviours - you just say `on Pointer { ... }` and you have a concurrently-executing coroutine that's lifetime is managed. But you don't think about any of that complexity, you just think of your entity as having a behaviour and go forth and make your game.</p><p>It also happens to have automatic multiplayer. Normally with multiplayer you have to worry about doing everything in a "multiplayer safe" way (i.e. be deterministic and only modify the things your side has authority over). My idea was to put all the multiplayer stuff in the programming language itself, underneath all your lines of code. This way, anything you write in that programming language can just be made multiplayer, automatically. So you can just pretend all your players are in one shared world, like a singleplayer game, and the engine does all the multiplayer for you. It was really difficult to make but it makes multiplayer so easy for you now.</p><p>Easel is my idea of how games should be made, or at least as close to the idea as I can achieve with 3 years of work, and I would love for more people to try it out.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45871014"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45871014" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45871014&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45869146"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>All I can say is good luck.

The red tape and regulations (in our state at least) made it clear that government runs for urban and suburban interests and actively undermines rural needs. I'm talking government in bed with large providers who had exclusive rights to run "high-speed" Internet to our towns and farms, even though they had never and were never planning on anything above dsl for most people and cable for the ones in town.</p><p>If I was more charismatic (and wasn't 1000% sure there were pictures of me doing drugs when I was in college), I would consider a run for state office, because it's a shit show for small towns here.</p><p>And that's the story of a) when we got sued by a large provider that I hope goes out of business and burns to the ground, and b) the last time I volunteered on a large project and why I will never take the lead on anything bigger than the Lion's Club pancake breakfast now.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45871004"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45871004" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45871004&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45869146"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>Porting Ruby to Fil-C</p><p>It's very interesting because the Ruby codebase uses a `typedef uintptr_t VALUE` type to mean any of the following:</p><p>- A pointer to the heap</p><p>- A Ruby tagged value (which may be a pointer to the heap)</p><p>- Any integer value that fits in `uintptr_t`</p><p>Fil-C doesn't allow you to carry around pointers using integers, in the sense that when you do that, the pointers lose their capabilities.</p><p>But in Ruby's case, it's not as simple as changing the typedef to a pointer type, since `VALUE` variables often end up being used for integer math (including bit math, shifts, etc).</p><p>So, it's going to take a nontrivial patch to Ruby to get it to work in Fil-C.

<div><p>I'm thinking a lot about the ARC-AGI ML benchmarks, especially the "shape" of the dataset and what that says about how it should be solved. I think there's good reasons to believe that deep learning - at least differentiable SGD backprop style - is a bad fit for this specific benchmark, due to the tasks being almost entirely discrete symmetries, and also having so little data to approximate the discrete symmetries with continuous ones (considering deep learning to be the learning of continuous symmetries). I think that a more explicit and discrete approach is the way to go, and it's possible to build something surprisingly general and not heuristic-based even without gradient descent, guided by minimum description length to search for both grid representations and solver functions. I'm looking for teammates for ARC-3 so hit me up if this sounds interesting, I'd love to chat!</p><p>I made a viewer on my website to build intuition for my preferred perception algorithm which is entropy filtering + correlation.

<div><p>I’m working on a performance capture library for Python because I often need to know the performance of backend systems I maintain. I frequently build tooling to capture performance and save it for later analysis. I/O operations get costly when writing lots of data to disk and creating good real-time analytics tools takes a lot of my time. I wanted a library that captures real-time performance analytics from Python backends.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/jakeroggenbuck/kronicler" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/jakeroggenbuck/kronicler</a></p><p>This is why I wrote kronicler to record performance metrics while being fast and simple to implement. I built my own columnar database in Rust to capture and analyze these logs.</p><p>To capture logs, `import kronicler` and add `@kronicler.capture` as a decorator to functions in Python. It will then start saving performance metrics to the custom database on disk. You can also use the middleware for FastAPI.</p><p>You can then view these performance metrics by adding a route to your server called `/logs` where you return `DB.logs()`. You can paste your hosted URL into the settings of usekronicler.com (the online dashboard) and view your data with a couple charts. View the readme or the website for more details for how to do this.</p><p>I'm still working on features like concurrency and other overall improvements. I've added a lot since the last time I shared on HN.

<div><p>I'm working on <a href="https://yap.town/" rel="nofollow">https://yap.town</a> - an SRS based language learning app.</p><p>I would say it combines the best parts of Duolingo and Anki. Anki is great for memorizing words, but you don't see the words in the context of novel sentences. Duolingo is great for exposure to new sentences, but it's oriented around "lessons" and SRS is an afterthought. (Duolingo is also not designed for people serious about learning a language IMO, it's too easy and goes too slowly.)</p><p>Had to do quite a bit to get it to work well.</p><p>1. At first you would think that if you know all the words in a sentence, that should be enough to understand the sentence. But it doesn't work like that. For starters, words can have multiple meanings. The french word "bois" can mean "(you) drink" or "wood". You want to learn these separately. I trained an NLP model (a gemma3 finetune) that I use to understand the manner each word is used in each sentence: <a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/anchpop/lexide-nlp-models" rel="nofollow">https://huggingface.co/collections/anchpop/lexide-nlp-models</a></p><p>2. Even then, what about a sentence like "you'd better not"? Even if you know the words "you" "had" "better" and "not", you still won't really get this. So I use the wiktionary "multiword terms" category for each language to get a huge list of terms like "'d better" , "you better believe it", etc, and teach these in addition to individual words. And then I only show sentences where you know all the individual words as well as all the terms.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45869935"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45869935" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45869935&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45869146"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I posted in this monthly thread first time in May when I launched a daily logic puzzle, Clues by Sam. Since then it's grown significantly, and I couldn't be happier!</p><p>The game has a farily simple frontend, but there is a fairly complex constraint solving algorithm as part of the puzzle making process. What makes the puzzle quite unique is that you can't "guess". You can only make guesses that are provable by logic. The algorithm ensuring this has worked flawlessly for months now (though I've manually inserted some silly mistakes once or twice).</p><p>Today's puzzle is one of the hardest to date.

<div><p>In network code: most people just let the OS choose a default adapter. It works fine, but it makes it hard to write software that works across machines with either (1) multiple NICs (and/or networks they point to.) or (2) multiple external Internet IPs. Look at STUN, for example.</p><p>A STUN server that lets people test what type of NAT they have uses two IPs. For such a server you have to manually specify the addresses to bind on to make for sure its setup right. As it goes, writing network software to do simple things like "bind on all local addresses", "bind publicly", "bind on all", is harder than it sounds. There are edge cases on different OSes and address families, so manually managing IPs is hard to do.</p><p>My network software lets devs easily manage NICs and routes they support without guessing about addressing. Additionally, I've written a bunch of software with the library already to do things like NAT traversal. So its really my own redesign of how to do networking on the Internet. Designed to hide a lot of the messiness. I'm still improving code quality so it's not ready yet.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>The U.S. government is reportedly preparing to ban the sale of wireless routers and other networking gear from <strong>TP-Link Systems</strong>, a tech company that currently enjoys an estimated 50% market share among home users and small businesses. Experts say while the proposed ban may have more to do with TP-Link’s ties to China than any specific technical threats, much of the rest of the industry serving this market also sources hardware from China and ships products that are insecure fresh out of the box.</p>
<div id="attachment_72586"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72586" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tplinkrouter.png" alt="" width="750" height="478" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tplinkrouter.png 962w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tplinkrouter-768x489.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tplinkrouter-782x498.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-72586">A TP-Link WiFi 6 AX1800 Smart WiFi Router (Archer AX20).</p></div>
<p><strong>The Washington Post</strong> recently <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/30/tp-link-proposed-ban-commerce-department/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that more than a half-dozen federal departments and agencies were backing a proposed ban on future sales of TP-Link devices in the United States. The story said <strong>U.S. Department of Commerce</strong> officials concluded TP-Link Systems products pose a risk because the U.S.-based company’s products handle sensitive American data and because the officials believe it remains subject to jurisdiction or influence by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>TP-Link Systems denies that, saying that it fully split from the Chinese TP-Link Technologies over the past three years, and that its critics have vastly overstated the company’s market share (TP-Link puts it at around 30 percent). TP-Link says it has headquarters in California, with a branch in Singapore, and that it manufactures in Vietnam. The company says it researches, designs, develops and manufactures everything except its chipsets in-house.</p>
<p>TP-Link Systems told The Post it has sole ownership of some engineering, design and manufacturing capabilities in China that were once part of China-based TP-Link Technologies, and that it operates them without Chinese government supervision.</p>
<p>“TP-Link vigorously disputes any allegation that its products present national security risks to the United States,” Ricca Silverio, a spokeswoman for TP-Link Systems, said in a statement. “TP-Link is a U.S. company committed to supplying high-quality and secure products to the U.S. market and beyond.”</p>
<p>Cost is a big reason TP-Link devices are so prevalent in the consumer and small business market: As <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.wired.com/story/tp-link-router-ban-investigation/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiVofql3OCQAxV7FFkFHVOHEAUQFnoECB0QAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw3r1EyJFoMB-2kJYtKQlvQB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this February 2025 story</a> from <strong>Wired</strong> observed regarding the proposed ban, TP-Link has long had a reputation for flooding the market with devices that are considerably cheaper than comparable models from other vendors. That price point (and consistently excellent performance ratings) has made TP-Link a favorite among Internet service providers (ISPs) that provide routers to their customers.</p>
<p>In August 2024, the chairman and the ranking member of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party called for an investigation into TP-Link devices, which they said were found on U.S. military bases and for sale at exchanges that sell them to members of the military and their families.</p>
<p>“TP-Link’s unusual degree of vulnerabilities and required compliance with PRC law are in and of themselves disconcerting,” the House lawmakers warned in <a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2024-08-13%20Letter%20to%20Commerce%20re%20TP-Link%20%28filed%29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a letter</a> (PDF) to the director of the Commerce Department. “When combined with the PRC government’s common use of SOHO [small office/home office] routers like TP-Link to perpetrate extensive cyberattacks in the United States, it becomes significantly alarming.”</p>
<p>The letter cited <a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/check-point-research-reveals-a-malicious-firmware-implant-for-tp-link-routers-linked-to-chinese-apt-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a May 2023 blog post</a> by <strong>Check Point Research</strong> about a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group dubbed “<strong>Camaro Dragon</strong>” that used a malicious firmware implant for some TP-Link routers to carry out a sequence of targeted cyberattacks against European foreign affairs entities. Check Point said while it only found the malicious firmware on TP-Link devices, “the firmware-agnostic nature of the implanted components indicates that a wide range of devices and vendors may be at risk.”</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/10/31/chinese-threat-actor-storm-0940-uses-credentials-from-password-spray-attacks-from-a-covert-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report</a> published in October 2024, <strong>Microsoft</strong> said it was tracking a network of compromised TP-Link small office and home office routers that has been abused by multiple distinct Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups since 2021. Microsoft found the hacker groups were leveraging the compromised TP-Link systems to conduct “password spraying” attacks against Microsoft accounts. Password spraying involves rapidly attempting to access a large number of accounts (usernames/email addresses) with a relatively small number of commonly used passwords.</p>
<p>TP-Link rightly points out that most of its competitors likewise source components from China. The company also correctly notes that advanced persistent threat (APT) groups from China and other nations have leveraged vulnerabilities in products from their competitors, such as Cisco and Netgear.</p>
<p>But that may be cold comfort for TP-Link customers who are now wondering if it’s smart to continue using these products, or whether it makes sense to buy more costly networking gear that might only be marginally less vulnerable to compromise.<span id="more-72491"></span></p>
<p>Almost without exception, the hardware and software that ships with most consumer-grade routers includes a number of default settings that need to be changed before the devices can be safely connected to the Internet. For example, bring a new router online without changing the default username and password and chances are it will only take a few minutes before it is probed and possibly compromised by some type of Internet-of-Things botnet. Also, it is incredibly common for the firmware in a brand new router to be dangerously out of date by the time it is purchased and unboxed.</p>
<p>Until quite recently, the idea that router manufacturers should make it easier for their customers to use these products safely was something of anathema to this industry. Consumers were largely left to figure that out on their own, with predictably disastrous results.</p>
<p>But over the past few years, many manufacturers of popular consumer routers have begun forcing users to perform basic hygiene — such as changing the default password and updating the internal firmware — before the devices can be used as a router. For example, most brands of “mesh” wireless routers — like Amazon’s Eero, Netgear’s Orbi series, or Asus’s ZenWifi — require online registration that automates these critical steps going forward (or at least through their stated support lifecycle).</p>
<p>For better or worse, less expensive, traditional consumer routers like those from Belkin and Linksys also now automate this setup by heavily steering customers toward installing a mobile app to complete the installation (this often comes as a shock to people more accustomed to manually configuring a router). Still, these products tend to put the onus on users to check for and install available updates periodically. Also, they’re often powered by underwhelming or else bloated firmware, and a dearth of configurable options.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone wants to fiddle with mobile apps or is comfortable with registering their router so that it can be managed or monitored remotely in the cloud. For those hands-on folks — and for power users seeking more advanced router features like VPNs, ad blockers and network monitoring — the best advice is to check if your router’s stock firmware can be replaced with open-source alternatives, such as <a href="https://openwrt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenWrt</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://dd-wrt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DD-WRT</a>.</p>
<p>These open-source firmware options are compatible with a wide range of devices, and they generally offer more features and configurability. Open-source firmware can even help extend the life of routers years after the vendor stops supporting the underlying hardware, but it still requires users to manually check for and install any available updates.</p>
<p>Happily, TP-Link users spooked by the proposed ban may have an alternative to outright junking these devices, as many TP-Link routers also support open-source firmware options like OpenWRT. While this approach may not eliminate any potential hardware-specific security flaws, it could serve as an effective hedge against more common vendor-specific vulnerabilities, such as undocumented user accounts, hard-coded credentials, and weaknesses that allow attackers to bypass authentication.</p>
<p>Regardless of the brand, if your router is more than four or five years old it may be worth upgrading for performance reasons alone — particularly if your home or office is primarily accessing the Internet through WiFi.</p>
<p>NB: The Post’s story notes that a substantial portion of TP-Link routers and those of its competitors are purchased or leased through ISPs. In these cases, the devices are typically managed and updated remotely by your ISP, and equipped with custom profiles responsible for authenticating your device to the ISP’s network. If this describes your setup, please do not attempt to modify or replace these devices without first consulting with your Internet provider.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle><polyline points="12 6 12 12 16 14"></polyline></svg>5 minutes</p><article><div><p>I really enjoy procedural generation, especially systems designed to work with hardware outputs. After starting work at Formlabs in September of 2023 and gaining access to much nicer printers than I was used to, I started wanting to tackle some large algorithmic structure projects. Complexity is free in 3d printing, the limit of design geometry is mostly how much time you’re willing to spend in CAD. I wanted to print the most complicated art piece I could think of. Marble Fountain is what I came up with.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ULpNiZU2tpg" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><h2 id="tracks">Tracks</h2><p>My initial system came together quickly. Randomly placing spaced out points, drawing a spline through them, and setting a constant slope just works. My first draft was just subtracting a tube from the solid support structure which worked but was super limited. I wanted to add more parts and so I started working on a path solver. I wanted to fit as much motion into the volume of the printer as possible. This turned out to be extremely challenging.</p><p>The solver starts by making a random series of line segments connecting the top and bottom of the lift. There are several different algorithms to generate this guess, as the initial conditional has a noticeable impact on the shape of the structure for lower path counts. It’s interesting to play with different variants of the starting conditions and see how they change during generation.</p><p>A series of functions update the positions over time to “pull” the points into a followable path.
The points making up each path:</p><ul><li>Stay in the bounding box</li><li>Evenly space themselves out</li><li>Pull towards a fixed height to enforce a constant slope</li><li>Enforce min and max turning radius of the path</li><li>Repel away from other tracks</li><li>Repel away from distant sections of our own track</li><li>Smooth out changes in slope to prevent jumps</li><li>Prevent slope from ever increasing</li></ul><p>Velocity is a much harder problem than I anticipated. The tracks break a lot of the obvious assumptions if you act like the marble is a point mass, as changing the bank of the track moves the axis of rotation and can burn off rotational inertia to friction. Long straight sections would build up too much speed and bearings fly off on the turns, but balls taking sharp turns at slow speed will lose too much momentum and stop. I settled on setting a minimum turn radius for the track and banking much more aggressively than is technically necessary for any given speed, so it constantly snakes back and forth to burn off speed.</p><p>One of the most elegant designs of the whole structure is how the lift acts like a ball screw. The the screw is constrained by the balls on all sides which allows it to run with no bearing at the top. This also leads to a failure mode where if the screw ever only has balls on one side it will immediately start wobbling badly enough that all the balls currently rolling will fall off the tracks.</p><h2 id="supports">Supports</h2><p>The support generation was surprisingly simple. Iterating from the top down and treating the support pillars as a particle system is quite robust. I spent more time tweaking the geometry for aesthetics than I did for actual structure and collision issues, although I did heavily lean on the overhang tolerance of the printer.</p><p>Each support:</p><ul><li>Pulls towards other supports, weighted by distance and similarity in size</li><li>Repels away from other supports</li><li>Pulls to stay in the bounding box</li><li>Pulls towards a fixed radius from the center of the structure</li></ul><p>Supports also have inertia, which is where the arcs in the structure of the support columns come from.</p><h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2><p>The final models take around 5-20 minutes to export. There’s a ton I could do to optimize the models, but at this point the geometry is simply beyond the scope of OpenSCAD. If I was rewriting this I would probably use a different tool more optimized for this type of organic geometry, likely an SDF library. I have vague ambitions to do a big rewrite eventually but figured sharing <a href="https://github.com/Will-Morr/MarbleFountain" target="_blank">janky code</a>
is better than none. I started this just planning for the janky splines as a weekend project but it has gotten thoroughly out of hand.</p><p>I have a ton of other ideas to play with if I do that big rewrite. There is no realistic velocity estimation at any point in the whole system right now, just a pile of heuristics. I was originally trying to not overcomplicate but building a proper acceleration model by measuring velocity with a camera would have almost definitely saved time overall. Trying to maintain a fixed slope makes collision prevention much harder but is required to keep speed within bounds. At this point I’m also just curious about the response curve, there’s a knee somewhere where the surfaces start to slip that I want to track down.</p><h2 id="looking-back">Looking back</h2><p>This was the most work I have ever put into a hobby project. I started in February 2024 and worked on it on and off until September. I applied to show it in a gallery (shoutout to <a href="https://www.newalliancegallery.com/" target="_blank">New Alliance Gallery</a>
in Somerville) with two months of warning, which wound up leading to a large crunch trying to make the system reliable enough to show in person in the weeks before the show. I was able to get it working consistently, although it did lose 2-3 balls an hour and could only run for a few hours without the motor overheating. I got pretty burned out and dropped the project, which is why I shelved it for a full year before sharing anything.</p><p>Finally, a huge thanks to my friend Alex who listened to me ramble about marbles for several months every day while walking home from work, gave a ton of helpful input, and lived with the dozens of ball bearings scattered across our apartment.</p><figure><img src="https://willmorrison.net/img/MarbleFountain/gallery.jpg" alt="Marble Fountain installed in New Alliance Gallery"></figure><p><a href="https://github.com/Will-Morr/MarbleFountain" target="_blank">GitHub Repo</a></p></div></article><hr><div><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"></path><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"></line></svg><span><a href="https://willmorrison.net/tags/proceduralgeneration/">ProceduralGeneration</a></span>

										<p>Bull markets make you feel smarter than you really are.</p>
<p>Bear markets make you feel dumber than you really are.</p>
<p>It’s almost impossible to avoid feeling like a know-it-all when things are going up and a know-nothing when things are going down.</p>
<p>That’s human nature.</p>
<p>Benjamin Graham started his investment partnership in the <a href="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2020/03/how-did-we-ever-get-to-the-roaring-twenties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roaring 20s</a> with $400,000 of money from clients and his own capital. In just three years he turned $400k into $2.5 million. Much of it was Graham’s own money, derived from a combination of savings and the management fees he earned.</p>
<p>This magical run of performance just so happened to coincide with a <a href="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2025/11/the-melt-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">melt-up</a> in the stock market.</p>
<p>Alas, like most people, Graham didn’t see the Great Depression coming. He tried to pick the bottom on numerous occasions with disastrous results.</p>
<p>Michael wrote about what happened in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://amzn.to/3Luz3F4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Mistakes</a>:</em></p>
<p><em>In 1930, thinking the worst was over, Graham went all in and then some. He used margin to leverage what he thought would be terrific returns. But the worst was not over, and when the Dow collapsed, Graham had his worst year ever, losing 50%. “He personally was wiped out in the crash. Having ducked the 1929 cataclysm, he was enticed back into the market before the final bottom.”</em></p>
<p>By 1932, the $2.5 million had dwindled to just $375k.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://amzn.to/3LtKOM7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memoir</a> Graham wrote about how his early successes impacted his mentality before the calamity:</p>
<p><em>At thirty-one I was convinced that I knew it all–or at least I knew all I needed to know about making money in stocks and bonds–that I had Wall Street by the tail, that my future was as unlimited as my ambitions, that I was destined to enjoy great wealth and all the material pleasures that wealth could buy. I thought of owning a large yacht, a villa at Newport, racehorses. <strong>I was too young to realize that I had caught a bad case of hubris.</strong></em></p>
<p>The good news is Graham was able to turn it around. He didn’t take a paycheck until all of his investors were made whole. Despite his setbacks in the Great Depression, his long-term track record was impressive while his impact on investor education still lives on.</p>
<p>One of my all-time favorite investment books is&nbsp;<em><a href="https://amzn.to/43iyZOQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars</a>&nbsp;</em>by Brendan Moynihan.</p>
<p>Moynihan tells the story of Jim Paul, a country boy from Kentucky who went from dirt-poor to millionaire trader on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to broke in a matter of years.</p>
<p>This is how Moynihan describes the story in the introduction:</p>
<p><em>One of the premises of this book is that the rise sets up the fall; the winning sets up the losing. You can’t really be set up for disaster without having it preceded by success.</em></p>
<p>It’s extremely difficult to understand this dynamic as a young person who has experienced some level of success in the markets. Moynihan explains:</p>
<p><em>If you start from scratch and have a run of successes, you are setting yourself up for the coming failure because the successes lead to a variety of psychological distortions. This is particularly true if you have unknowingly broken the rules of the game and won anyway. Once that happens to you, you think that you are somehow special and exempt from following the rules.</em></p>
<p>There are <em>a lot</em> of people who have made <em>a lot</em> of money in this bull market.</p>
<p>So many investors have made life-altering amounts of money. This is a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>But it’s important to avoid letting success in the markets go to your head. This cycle will not last forever. Making money won’t always be this easy.</p>
<p>The market will make you feel dumb again at some point…even when it’s not true.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>This monograph presents the core principles that have guided the development of diffusion models, tracing their origins and showing how diverse formulations arise from shared mathematical ideas. Diffusion modeling starts by defining a forward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data distribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate distributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise back into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three complementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational autoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The score-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the evolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely regions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation as following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a learned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a time-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data. Sampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise into data along a continuous trajectory. On this foundation, the monograph discusses guidance for controllable generation, efficient numerical solvers, and diffusion-motivated flow-map models that learn direct mappings between arbitrary times. It provides a conceptual and mathematically grounded understanding of diffusion models for readers with basic deep-learning knowledge.

											Edsger Wybe Dijkstra was one of the most influential members of computing science’s founding generation. Among the domains in which his scientific contributions are fundamental are
											<ul>
												<li type="disc">algorithm design
												</li><li type="disc">programming languages
												</li><li type="disc">program design
												</li><li type="disc">operating systems
												</li><li type="disc">distributed processing
												</li><li type="disc">formal specification and verification

								<h2>The Manuscripts</h2>
								<p>Like most of us, Dijkstra always believed it a scientist’s duty to maintain a lively correspondence with his scientific colleagues. To a greater extent than most of us, he put that conviction into practice. For over four decades, he mailed copies of his consecutively numbered technical notes, trip reports, insightful observations, and pungent commentaries, known collectively as “EWDs”, to several dozen recipients in academia and industry. Thanks to the ubiquity of the photocopier and the wide interest in Dijkstra’s writings, the informal circulation of many of the EWDs eventually reached into the thousands.</p>
								<p>Although most of Dijkstra’s publications began life as EWD manuscripts, the great majority of his manuscripts remain unpublished. They have been inaccessible to many potential readers, and those who have received copies have been unable to cite them in their own work. To alleviate both of these problems, the department has collected over a thousand of the manuscripts in this permanent web site, in the form of PDF bitmap documents (to read them, you’ll need a copy of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html">Acrobat Reader</a>). We hope you will find it convenient, useful, inspiring, and enjoyable.</p>
								<p>The original manuscripts, along with diaries, correspondence, photographs, and other papers, are housed at <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utcah/00378/cah-00378.html#a0">The Center for American History</a> of The University of Texas at Austin.</p>
								<h3>Indexes</h3>
								<p>Each manuscript file is accessible through either of two indexes:</p>
								<p><b><span size="+1">0. <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/indexBibTeX.html">BibTeX</a> index. </span></b>Each entry includes all the available bibliographic data.</p>
								<p><b><span size="+1">1. Ad-hoc indexes. </span></b>These contain titles only, but are faster if you know what you’re looking for.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p><a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/indexChron.html"><b>EWD-numbered documents</b></a><b> </b>(This index gives an approximate correspondence between manuscripts’ EWD numbers and the year in which they appeared.)</p>

								</blockquote>
								<p>You can find a table relating EWD numbers to publication years <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/indexChron.html">here</a>.</p>
								<p>Many of the privately circulated manuscripts collected here were subsequently published; their <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/copyrights.html">copyrights</a> are held by their respective publishers.</p>
								<h3>Transcripts and translations</h3>
								<p>A growing number of the PDF bitmap documents have been <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/transcriptions.html">transcribed</a> to make them searchable and accessible to visitors who are visually impaired.</p>
								<p>A few of the manuscripts written in Dutch have been <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/translations/translations.html">translated</a> into English, and one —EWD1036— has been translated into <a title="Spanish translation of EWD 1036" href="http://www.smaldone.com.ar/documentos/ewd/sobre_la_crueldad.html">Spanish</a>. EWD28  has been translated from English into <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/translations/EWD28%20Russian.html">Russian</a>.</p>
								<p>For these transcriptions and translations we are grateful to over sixty <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/transcribers.html">contributors</a>. <span color="#ff0033"><b>Volunteers</b></span> willing to transcribe manuscripts are always <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/invitation.html">welcome</a> (<b>Note</b>: doing EWDs justice in translation has turned out to be too difficult, so we are no longer soliciting translations).</p>
								<p><b>Proofreading</b> Each transcription gets a cursory scan as it’s prepared for uploading, but since a web page can always be updated, I don’t strive for (unattainable) perfection before installing it. On the web, proofreading is a game that can be played by every reader; if you spot an error, please

								<h3>Links between EWDs</h3>
								<p>A compilation of <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/AnnotationsEtc/Michaelis.html" target="_blank">cross-references</a> has been contributed by Diethard Michaelis. As its author notes, the collection is incomplete, and all readers are invited to add to it.</p>
								<p>Dijkstra often returned to topics about which he had already written, when he had something new to say or even just a better way of saying it. When Dijkstra himself didn’t provide the backward references, we indicate the relationship by "see also" links in the index, leaving the judgment of the extent to which the earlier EWD is superseded by the later one to the reader. Any reader who notices such a relationship is invited to

								<h3>Summaries</h3>
								<p>We have begun adding <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/Summaries/Summaries.html">summaries</a> of the EWDs. This innovation was suggested by Günter Rote, who contributed the first dozen summaries. Additional contributions of summaries—especially summaries in English of EWDs in Dutch—are most welcome.</p>
								<hr>
								<h3>Copyrights</h3>
								<p>Copyrights in most EWDs  are  held by his children, one of whom —



                                
—  handles  requests for permission to publish reproductions. The exceptions are documents that were published, and whose copyrights are held by their publishers; those documents are listed <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/copyrightsDetail.html" title="Copyrights">here</a>, and each one is provided with a cover page identifying the copyright holder.</p>
								<p>Because the original manuscripts are in possession of the Briscoe Center for American History at The University of Texas, <a href="http://www.cah.utexas.edu/research/permission_publish.php" title="BCAH permission policies">the Center’s policies</a> are also applicable.</p>

								<h2>Video and audio</h2>
								<p>In addition to the manuscripts, you may enjoy some <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/video-audio/video-audio.html">recordings</a> of Dijkstra lectures and interviews.</p>
								<hr>
								<h2>About Dijkstra and his work</h2>
								<p>An <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/misc/vanVlissingenInterview.html">interview</a> with Dijkstra (Spanish translation <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/misc/vanVlissingenEntrevista.html">here</a>) was conducted in 1985 by Rogier F. van Vlissingen, who has also written a <a href="http://digitalundivide.blogspot.com/2005/12/ewd-personal-reflection.html">personal reflection</a> on “Dijkstra’s sense of what computer science and programming are and what they aren’t.”</p>
								<p>Another interview was conducted by Philip L. Frana in August 2001. A <a title="link to Dijkstra oral-history interview" href="https://hdl.handle.net/11299/107247">transcript</a> is available in the on-line collection of the Charles Babbage Institute.</p>
								<p>To mark the occasion of Dijkstra’s retirement in November 1999 from the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in Computer Sciences, which he had occupied since 1984, and to celebrate his forty-plus years of seminal contributions to computing science, the Department of Computer Sciences organized a symposium, <i>In Pursuit of Simplicity</i>, which took place on his birthday in May 2000. The symposium’s <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/symposiumProgram.pdf">program</a> (10 MB) contains an outline of Dijkstra’s career, as well as a collection of quotes culled from his writings, from his blackboard, and from what others have said about him. Banquet speeches by David Gries, Fred Schneider, Krzysztof Apt, W.M. Turski, and H. Richards were recorded on a <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/videos/EWD6.mpg" target="_blank">video</a>.</p>
								<p>Dijkstra’s death in August 2002 was marked by many <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/obituaries/obits.html">obituaries</a> and memorials, including the Computer Sciences department’s <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/memorial/" target="_blank">memorial celebration.</a></p>
								<p>A <a title="Maarten van Emden: I remember Edsger Dijkstra" href="http://vanemden.wordpress.com/2008/05/06/i-remember-edsger-dijkstra-1930-2002/">remembrance</a> of Dijkstra was posted in May 2008 by Maarten van Emden (thanks to Tristram Brelstaff for noting it).</p>

								<p>A <a title="E.G.Daylight's Dijkstra blog" href="http://www.dijkstrascry.com/">blog</a> devoted to Dijkstra’s works and thoughts has been created, and is being maintained, by the historian of computing Edgar G. Daylight.

								<p>In his blog A Programmer’s Place, Maarten van Emden has an <a title="link to van Emden's blog entry" href="http://vanemden.wordpress.com/2011/01/15/another-scoop-by-dijkstra/#more-366">entry entitled “Another scoop by Dijkstra?”.</a> The entry describes Dijkstra’s “remarkable insight [in “<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/ewd02xx/EWD249.PDF">Notes on Structured Programming” (EWD 249)</a>] that resolves the stand-off between the Sieve of Eratosthenes (efficient in terms of time, but not memory) and the method of Trial Division (efficient in terms of memory, but not time)” by applying the Assembly-line Principle.</p>
								<p>The <a href="http://www.podc.org/dijkstra/">Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing</a> honors Dijkstra’s “foundational work on concurrency primitives (such as the semaphore), concurrency problems (such as mutual exclusion and deadlock), reasoning about concurrent systems, and self-stabilization [, which] comprises one of the most important supports upon which the field of distributed computing is built.” </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Managing a popular open source project is a lot of work and can be very rewarding. This is especially so for a security-critical application such as KeePassXC that enables people around the world to protect their most sensitive information. As such, we have implemented a robust quality control process that ensures all code merged into production is thoroughly reviewed, tested, and signed off on.</p>
<p>Recently, we changed <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md">our contribution policy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/blob/develop/README.md">readme</a> to address code created by Generative AI by adding the following paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Generative AI is fast becoming a first-party feature in most development environments, including GitHub itself. If the majority of a code submission is made using Generative AI (e.g., agent-based or vibe coding), then <strong>we will document that in the pull request.</strong> All code submissions go through a rigorous review process regardless of the development workflow or submitter.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This statement has sparked a variety of reactions from innocent questions to serious concerns. We want to address them head-on and explain how we use AI and how we keep the project safe and secure.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>However, before we can explain our process for AI contributions, we should explain our general code contribution workflow first. The KeePassXC Team has five maintainers with the ability to merge code into the develop branch, including two core maintainers with admin access to the organisation. Code contributions are generally posted to GitHub as a <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/pulls">pull request</a>. Code submitted this way runs through our CI pipeline for basic quality assurance and is then tested and reviewed line by line by one of the maintainers. Merging is blocked until at least one maintainer signs off on the changes. If the changes were proposed by a maintainer, another maintainer will do the review. <em>This policy is strictly followed</em>, even for small changes. After the review, the submitted commits are squashed into a single commit to ensure only the tested top state makes it into the main branch, and the CI will run again after the commit is merged.</p>
<p>This process is fully transparent and open for anyone to see, and it does not change with AI. We take no shortcuts. At KeePassXC, we use AI for two main purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>As an additional pair of “eyes” in code reviews.</strong> <br>
In this function, AI summarises the changes (the least helpful part) and points out implementation errors a human reviewer may have missed. AI reviews don’t replace maintainer code review, nor do they relieve maintainers from their due diligence. AI code reviews complement our existing CI pipelines that perform unit tests, memory checks, and static code analysis (CodeQL). As such, they are a net benefit and make KeePassXC <em>strictly safer.</em> Some examples of AI reviews in action: <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/pull/12602#discussion_r2464094552">example 1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/pull/12246#pullrequestreview-2969574349">example 2</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For creating pull requests that solve simple and focused issues, add boilerplate code and test cases.</strong> <br>
Unfortunately, some people got the impression that KeePassXC was now being vibe coded. This is wrong. We do not vibe code, and no unreviewed AI code makes it into the code base. Full stop. We have used  Copilot agent to draft pull requests, which are then subsequently tweaked in follow-up commits, and reviewed by a maintainer, openly for anyone to see, with the same scrutiny as any other submission. Good pull requests are merged (<a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/pull/12198">example</a>), bad pull requests are rejected (<a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/pull/12203#issuecomment-3478000274">example</a>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All this is only part of the development process. <strong>There are no AI features inside KeePassXC and there never will be!</strong></p>
<p>The use of Copilot for drafting pull requests is reserved for very simple and focused tasks with a small handful of changes, such as simple bugfixes or UI changes. We use it sparingly (mostly because it’s not very good at complex tasks) and only where we think it offers a benefit. Copilot is good at helping developers plan complex changes by reviewing the code base and writing suggestions in markdown, as well as boilerplate tasks such as test development. Copilot can mess up, and we catch that in our standard review process (e.g., by <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/pull/12588/commits/8495b0a219d02999d0a8bf3a688cb69271586a28">committing a full directory of rubbish</a>, which we <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/pull/12588/commits/6c2219e0a9a827c6d29ca9bbb231d437387890fd">identified and fixed</a>). You can review our <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/blob/develop/.github/copilot-instructions.md">copilot instructions</a>. Would we ever let AI rewrite our crypto stack? No. Would we let it refactor and rewrite large parts of the application? No. Would we ask it to fix a regression or add more test cases? Yes, sometimes.</p>
<p>Since we are using AI responsibly this way, it made little sense to ban AI submissions by third-party contributors. Such a policy would be near-impossible to enforce anyway. In fact, we’d rather have them transparently disclose the use of AI than hide it and submit the code against our terms. According to our policy, any significant use of AI in a pull request must be disclosed and labelled. As of writing, we have <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3A%22pr%3A+ai-assisted%22">7 open and 11 closed AI-assisted pull requests</a>. Feel free to check and review them yourself; it’s all open and transparent. If you spot any actual issues with the code that we missed, please tell us.</p>
<p>At the moment, this is all an experiment for us, and we will adjust our policies and methods as the need arises. There was a possibility that we’d be swamped with low-quality AI pull requests, but that has so far not manifested.</p>
<p>A fear often expressed was that we’d become lazy and lose our skills to review (AI) code properly. Let me tell you: all members of the KeePassXC team have many years of experience in software engineering and project management, we have maintained KeePassXC for almost a decade, and we still code ourselves for work and for fun. This will not suddenly go away because we have another tool in our belts.</p>
<p>Certain more esoteric concerns about AI code being somehow inherently inferior to “real code” are not based in reality. Code is deterministic, and the same instruction will always do the same thing regardless of who or what wrote it. There is no invisible ink. An incorrect snippet copied from an online forum is equally wrong and dangerous to one generated by AI or one invented by organic brain cells. What we must ensure is correctness and we do that with code review and tests.</p>
<p>And lastly, an interesting complaint we saw was that because AI code was optimised to look appealing to humans, LLMs could supposedly slip innocent-looking but malicious code past our code review. Personally, I would be much more concerned about a skilled human saboteur doing that than a general-purpose code LLM—look no further than famous recent supply-chain attacks. Beyond their technical limitations, commercial LLMs are not designed to purposefully generate nice but incorrect code (certainly not the ones we use), and it is hard to imagine how this would be a good marketing strategy. Malicious and deceptive LLMs are absolutely conceivable, but that would bring us back to the saboteur.</p>
<p>To add a little more context to the deceptive LLM argument: LLMs are indeed optimised by alignment methods to develop a desired style. This is not a magic superhuman trait. In fact, were you ever annoyed by the bubbly, wordy, seemingly eloquent, yet deeply obtuse language of LLM text? You’re not alone. LLM language is not magical, it is optimised to cater to the preferences of a broad cross-section of certain (mostly North-American) demographics. But all this is beside the point, because code is not a persuasive essay. There are many ways to write bad code (we have seen a lot of bad code submitted before LLMs), but in the end, it must produce a measurable result that needs to pass a test in order to be accepted.</p>
<p>So please, be skeptical of AI. But also be skeptical of human strangers as we are to you. If our AI policy toppled your trust in us, ask yourself why you trusted us (or anyone) in the first place. You don’t know us, you trust our reputation, and we earned that by building a stable product, which we will continue to do. You have our full commitment that we will not integrate any AI features into KeePassXC, and we will not merge any code (human or AI) without tests and thorough review. We have high standards; please continue holding us to them, but let’s have a rational and informed conversation.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_61">
<p>Montana has made history as the first state in the U.S. to legally protect its citizens’ right to access and use computational tools and artificial intelligence technologies. Governor Greg Gianforte signed Senate Bill 212, officially known as the Montana Right to Compute Act (MRTCA), into law.</p>
<p>The groundbreaking legislation affirms Montanans’ fundamental right to own and operate computational resources — including hardware, software, and AI tools — under the state’s constitutional protections for property and free expression. Supporters of the bill say it represents a major step in securing digital freedoms in an increasingly AI-driven world.</p>
<p>“Montana is once again leading the way in defending individual liberty,” said Senator Daniel Zolnikov, the bill’s sponsor and a longtime advocate for digital privacy. “With the Right to Compute Act, we are ensuring that every Montanan can access and control the tools of the future.”</p>
<p>While the law allows state regulation of computation in the interest of public health and safety, it sets a high bar: any restrictions must be <em>demonstrably necessary</em> and <em>narrowly tailored</em> to serve a compelling interest. Legal experts note that this is one of the most protective standards available under Montana law.</p>
<p>The act also includes provisions for AI-controlled critical infrastructure, requiring both a “shutdown mechanism” to allow human control and annual safety reviews — a move aimed at balancing innovation with public safety concerns.</p>
<p>The bill has drawn praise from privacy advocates and tech policy groups. Tanner Avery, Policy Director at the free-market think tank Frontier Institute, called the law a “flag in the ground” for digital rights, adding: “Montana has made clear it will treat any attempt to infringe on fundamental digital freedoms with the utmost scrutiny.”</p>
<p>The MRTCA stands in stark contrast to recent regulatory efforts in other states, such as California, Virginia, and New York, where proposals to rein in AI technologies have either failed or been heavily revised. Montana’s approach leans toward empowering individual users rather than restricting access.</p>
<p>The law has already inspired similar efforts in New Hampshire, where lawmakers are pushing a constitutional amendment guaranteeing access to computation. Rep. Keith Ammon, the state’s Majority Floor Leader, praised Montana’s leadership: “This is the kind of bold move that sets the tone for the rest of the country.”</p>
<p>Nationally, the Right to Compute movement is gaining traction. Spearheaded by the grassroots group RightToCompute.ai, the campaign argues that computation — like speech and property — is a fundamental human right. “A computer is an extension of the human capacity to think,” the organization states.</p>
<p>The movement is supported by Haltia.AI, a Dubai-based AI startup, and the ASIMOV Protocol, a blockchain consortium advocating for decentralized AI infrastructure. Talal Thabet, Co-Founder of both groups, praised Montana’s law as “a monumental step forward in ensuring individuals retain control of their own data and digital tools.”</p>
<p>As debates over AI governance and digital rights continue to evolve, Montana’s bold new law could serve as a blueprint for other states seeking to safeguard freedom in the digital era.</p>

Distilled from a decade of experience, Zensical is our effort to overcome the technical limitations of MkDocs, reaching far beyond its capabilities.</strong></p> <p>Zensical is the result of thousands of hours of work – built from the ground up for a modern and comfortable authoring experience, while making it easy for developers to extend and customize Zensical through its upcoming module system. Our goal is to support docs-as-code workflows with tens of thousands of pages, without compromising performance or usability.</p> <p>To make the transition seamless, <a href="#maximum-compatibility">compatibility</a> comes first. We're putting significant effort into ensuring a smooth migration from Material for MkDocs for all users. Zensical can natively read <code>mkdocs.yml</code>, allowing you to build your existing project with minimal changes. As of now, a subset of plugins is supported, and we're working on feature parity in the coming months.</p> <p>Zensical is fully Open Source, licensed under MIT, and can be used for any purpose, including for commercial use. We're also saying goodbye to our sponsorware model, replacing it with our new offering for professional users: <a href="#zensical-spark">Zensical Spark</a>. This allows us to stay independent, maximizing user value, as we shape the future of Zensical together with you.</p> <p><em>You can subscribe to <a href="https://zensical.org/about/newsletter/">our newsletter</a> to stay in the loop</em>.</p> <!-- more --> <hr> <p><strong>This is the second article in a four-part series:</strong></p> <ol> <li><a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/blog/2024/08/19/how-were-transforming-material-for-mkdocs/">Transforming Material for MkDocs</a></li> <li>Zensical – A modern static site generator built by the creators of Material for MkDocs.</li> <li>What happens to the features in Insiders <small>coming November 11, 2025</small></li> <li>A path forward for our community <small>coming November 18, 2025</small></li> </ol> <h2 id="why-zensical">Why Zensical?<a href="#why-zensical" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>Since its initial release in 2016, Material for MkDocs has helped tens of thousands of teams to publish and maintain reliable documentation. However, in recent years, it has become apparent that we were running up against limitations of our core dependency, MkDocs. These limitations proved impossible to overcome as they are deeply rooted in its architecture.</p> <p>We also mentioned in our <a href="https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/discussions/8461">update on our foundational work</a> that MkDocs must be considered a supply chain risk, since it's unmaintained since August 2024. It has seen no releases in over a year and is accumulating unresolved issues and pull requests. These developments have forced us to cut our ties to MkDocs as a dependency.</p> <p>In order to map out a path forward, we went back to the drawing board, talked to dozens of our professional users and thoroughly analyzed the MkDocs ecosystem. We didn't just want to create a fork or port of MkDocs, but decided to rethink static site generation from first principles.</p> <p>With Zensical, we are creating a modern static site generator, which is compatible with your content and customizations, and addresses MkDocs' limitations. While Material for MkDocs is built on top of MkDocs, <strong>Zensical consolidates both projects into one coherent stack</strong>, covering static site generation, theming, and customization. What you can expect today:</p> <ul> <li><a href="#authoring-experience">5x faster rebuilds</a></li> <li><a href="#modern-design">Modern design</a></li> <li><a href="#blazing-fast-search">Blazing-fast search</a></li> </ul> <p>Although we haven't reached full feature parity yet, you can already use Zensical to build your existing Material for MkDocs projects with minimal changes.</p> <p><em>You can jump to the <a href="#maximum-compatibility">compatibility</a> section to learn what is already supported.</em></p> <h2 id="what-you-can-expect">What you can expect<a href="#what-you-can-expect" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <h3 id="solid-foundation">Solid foundation<a href="#solid-foundation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3> <p>Our goal with Zensical is to create a coherent and modern stack, vertically integrating all parts of the authoring experience (AX), developer experience (DX), and user experience (UX). This gives us a significant competitive advantage over solutions that overly rely on third-party frameworks and dependencies, helping us to create much more robust Open Source software.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/zensical/zrx/">ZRX</a>, our new differential build engine, creates a solid foundation for Zensical, and is an Open Source project of its own. It's a fresh take on making differential data flows easy to build and a joy to work with. Most engineering effort has gone into ZRX, as it forms the backbone of Zensical, and will allow us to ship features faster.</p> <p>Following the principle of architectural hoisting, we moved essential, reusable functionality into ZRX, which allows us to keep Zensical's core simple and focused on static site generation. ZRX handles the heavy lifting – differential builds, caching, and data flow orchestration.</p> <p>With the upcoming <a href="https://zensical.org/about/roadmap/#module-system">module system</a> and <a href="https://zensical.org/about/roadmap/#component-system">component system</a>, both of which are on our public <a href="https://zensical.org/about/roadmap/">roadmap</a>, Zensical will gain more degrees of freedom in the coming months, allowing you to extend and customize Zensical in ways that were previously impossible with MkDocs.</p> <h3 id="modern-design">Modern design<a href="#modern-design" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3> <p>Zensical brings a fresh, modern design that breaks out of the Materal Design aesthetic, creating a visual foundation that is more easily brandable and adaptable to different use cases. The new design prioritizes clarity, simplicity, and usability, while having a more professional finish:</p> <figure> <p><img alt="Zensical" src="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/blog/zensical/screenshot.png#gh-light-mode-only"> <img alt="Zensical" src="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/blog/zensical/screenshot-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only"></p> <figcaption> <p>Our public <a href="https://zensical.org/about/roadmap/">roadmap</a>, built with Zensical</p> </figcaption> </figure> <p>Right now, the layout and site structure of Zensical match Material for MkDocs closely, as we're focusing on ensuring maximum compatibility. Once we finish work on our upcoming <a href="https://zensical.org/about/roadmap/#component-system">component system</a>, we'll provide an alternative that is much more flexible and adaptable, and can be tailored to different use cases and branding requirements more easily.</p> <p><em>You can also keep the Material for MkDocs look and feel with a single line of configuration.</em></p> <h3 id="blazing-fast-search">Blazing-fast search<a href="#blazing-fast-search" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3> <p>Client-side search isn't a compromise – for the vast majority of static sites, it's the best solution, since it's faster, involves zero maintenance, and doesn't require you to pay for a service.</p> <p>As covered in depth in <a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/blog/2024/08/19/how-were-transforming-material-for-mkdocs/#search-and-discovery">the first part of this series</a>, the current search implementation in Material for MkDocs has severe limitations, and is based on a now unmaintained library, which is why we decided to build a new search engine from scratch. It's based on the same goals as Zensical itself: performance, flexibility, and extensibility.</p> <p>Disco, our modular and blazing-fast client-side search engine, is exclusively available in Zensical. When you build your site with Zensical, your users will immediately benefit from Disco's improved ranking algorithm, as well as its filtering and aggregation capabilities:</p> <figure> <p><img alt="Zensical" src="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/blog/zensical/screenshot-search.png#gh-light-mode-only"> <img alt="Zensical" src="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/blog/zensical/screenshot-search-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only"></p> <figcaption> <p>Disco on <a href="https://zensical.org/">zensical.org</a></p> </figcaption> </figure> <p>In early 2026, we'll be releasing Disco as a standalone Open Source project. With the feedback of our professional users in <a href="#zensical-spark">Zensical Spark</a>, we're going to evolve the search experience, turning Disco into a highly configurable and customizable search engine that adapts to your needs.</p> <p><em>You can subscribe to <a href="https://zensical.org/about/newsletter/">our newsletter</a> to receive news about Disco</em>.</p>  <p>Slow feedback loops can be a major pain point when writing documentation. Almost all of us know the feeling of waiting for the static site generator to finish building the site, just to see a small change reflected in the output. With Zensical, we're finally addressing this issue.</p> <p>It's important to understand that we're not yet utilizing the differential capabilities of <a href="https://github.com/zensical/zrx/">ZRX</a> to the fullest extent, as we're forced to make several compromises to ensure maximum <a href="#maximum-compatibility">compatibility</a> with Material for MkDocs at the moment. Markdown rendering needs to go through Python Markdown, which forces us to pay for extra marshalling costs.</p> <p>While the initial build can sometimes be slower than with MkDocs, repeated builds – especially when serving the site – are already 4 to 5x faster, as only changed files need to be rebuilt.</p> <p>We're also working on a new Markdown toolchain based on a CommonMark-compliant parser written in Rust, which will make Markdown processing significantly faster. We'll be tackling this as part of the upcoming <a href="https://zensical.org/about/roadmap/#component-system">component system</a>, which we'll start working on in early 2026. Once our new Markdown toolchain is ready, we'll provide automated tools to translate between Python Markdown and CommonMark, so you don't need to manually migrate your content.</p> <h3 id="maximum-compatibility">Maximum compatibility<a href="#maximum-compatibility" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3> <p><a href="https://zensical.org/compatibility/">Compatibility with Material for MkDocs</a> is our top priority. We understand that switching to a new static site generator can be challenging, especially for large projects with many customizations. Therefore, we've put significant effort into ensuring that Zensical understands <code>mkdocs.yml</code> configuration files, so that you can build your projects with minimal changes.</p> <p>This means your existing Markdown files, template overrides, CSS and JavaScript extensions don't need to be touched, primarily because we did not change the generated HTML, and rely on Python Markdown for processing your content.</p> <p>However, plugins are a different story. In MkDocs, practically all plugins have side effects, making it impossible to parallelize builds. We started from first principles and asked: what should extensibility look like in a modern static site generator? Our answer is the upcoming <a href="https://zensical.org/about/roadmap/#module-system">module system</a>, which takes a fundamentally different approach based on four core principles:</p> <ul> <li>Modules can inject, extend, and re-define functionality</li> <li>Modules are deterministic through topological ordering</li> <li>Modules foster reusability, with the possibility to remix them</li> <li>Modules can cooperate through well-defined contracts</li> </ul> <p>We're working on shipping essential functionality as provided by MkDocs plugins as built-in modules. In early 2026, we will open the module system to third-party developers, so they can start building their own modules, as we see Zensical as the heart of a thriving ecosystem.</p> <h2 id="zensical-spark">Zensical Spark<a href="#zensical-spark" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>Zensical Spark, <a href="https://zensical.org/spark/">our offering for professionals</a>, is the result of countless calls with professional users of Material for MkDocs.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><br>How I spent two decades tracking down the creators of a 1987 USENET game and learned modern packaging tools in the process.<br></p>



<h2 id="cp-md-0-the-discovery-a-digital-time-capsule-from-1987"><a href="https://cryptpad.fr/#cp-md-0-the-discovery-a-digital-time-capsule-from-1987"></a>The Discovery: A Digital Time Capsule from 1987</h2>



<p>Picture this: October 26, 1987. The Berlin Wall still stands, the World Wide Web is just text, and software is distributed through USENET newsgroups in text files split across multiple posts. On that day, Edward Barlow posted something special to <code>comp.sources.games</code>:</p>



<p><strong>“conquest – middle earth multi-player game, Part01/05”</strong></p>



<p>That’s how Ed Barlow <a href="http://https//groups.google.com/g/comp.sources.games/c/188dE9OtKhg/m/6vJvv6V4SzIJ">announced it</a> at the time, before quickly changed the name to Conquer.</p>



<p>This was <strong>Conquer</strong> – a sophisticated multi-player strategy game that would influence countless others. Players controlled nations in Middle Earth, managing resources, armies, magic systems, and diplomatic relations. What made it remarkable wasn’t just the gameplay, but how it was built and distributed in an era when “open source” wasn’t even a term yet.</p>



<h2 id="cp-md-0-chapter-0-university-days-"><a href="https://cryptpad.fr/#cp-md-0-chapter-0-university-days-"></a>Chapter 0: University Days.<p><img decoding="async" width="150" height="150" src="https://vejeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/edificiorojo.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://vejeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/edificiorojo.jpg 700w, https://vejeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/edificiorojo-300x300.jpg 300w, https://vejeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/edificiorojo-150x150.jpg 150w, https://vejeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/edificiorojo-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px"></p></h2>



<p>It was during these days, in the middle of the 90s, that my fellow students and I spent hours experimenting with terminals in the <a href="http://https//www.informatica.us.es/index.php/historia/la-facultad">Computer Unix Labs</a>, USENET, links, news, msgs, and of course: conquer. That game was a gem that required to be the leader of a country, and with a map representing as characters each player could control their elven kingdom, orcish empire, or human armies to fight each other while controlling all the details of the economy.</p>



<p>But by 2006, this piece of computing history was trapped in legal limbo.</p>



<h2 id="cp-md-0-chapter-1-the-quest-begins-2006-"><a href="https://cryptpad.fr/#cp-md-0-chapter-1-the-quest-begins-2006-"></a>Chapter 1: The Quest Begins (2006)</h2>



<p>As a university student in Spain in the early ’90s, I’d encountered Conquer in the Unix labs. Fast forward to 2006, and I realized this pioneering game was at risk of being lost forever. The source code existed, scattered across ancient USENET archives, but its licensing was unclear – typical of the “post it and see what happens” era of early internet software distribution.</p>



<p>I started what I thought would be a simple project: get permission from the original authors to <a href="http://https//lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/10/msg00063.html">relicense the code under GPL</a> so it could be properly preserved and packaged for modern Linux distributions.</p>



<p><strong>Simple, right?</strong></p>



<h2 id="cp-md-0-chapter-2-digital-detective-work"><a href="https://cryptpad.fr/#cp-md-0-chapter-2-digital-detective-work"></a>Chapter 2: Digital Detective Work</h2>



<p>Finding Edward Barlow and Adam Bryant in 2006 was like archaeological work. Email addresses from the 1980s were long dead. USENET posts provided few clues. I scoured old university directories, googled fragments of names, and followed digital breadcrumbs across decades-old forums.</p>



<p>The breakthrough came through pure persistence and a bit of luck. After months of searching, I managed to contact Ed Barlow. His response was refreshingly casual: <em>“Yes i delegated it all to adam aeons ago. Im easy on it all…. copyleft didnt exist when i wrote it and it was all for fun so…”</em></p>



<p>But there was a catch – I needed permission from Adam Bryant too, and he seemed to have vanished into the digital ether.</p>



<h2 id="cp-md-0-chapter-3-the-long-wait-2006-2011-"><a href="https://cryptpad.fr/#cp-md-0-chapter-3-the-long-wait-2006-2011-"></a>Chapter 3: The Long Wait (2006-2011)</h2>



<p>I documented everything on the Debian Legal mailing lists, created a GNU Savannah task (<a href="http://https//savannah.nongnu.org/task/?5945">#5945</a>), and even wrote blog posts hoping Adam would find them. The legal experts were clear: I needed explicit written permission from both copyright holders.</p>



<p>Years passed. The project stalled.</p>



<p>Then, on February 23, 2011, something magical happened. My phone buzzed with a contact form submission:</p>



<p><strong>“I heard news of the request to release the code. I grant permission to release the code under GPL.”</strong> – Adam Bryant</p>



<p><em>He had found one of my articles online and reached out on his own.</em></p>



<h2 id="cp-md-0-chapter-4-the-plot-twist-version-5-emerges-2025-"><a href="https://cryptpad.fr/#cp-md-0-chapter-4-the-plot-twist-version-5-emerges-2025-"></a>Chapter 4: The Plot Twist – Version 5 Emerges (2025)</h2>



<p>Fast forward to 2025, and Stephen Smoogen contacts me about my relicesing efforts in 2006 and how he was particularly interested in reviving: <strong>Conquer Version 5</strong> – a complete rewrite by Adam with advanced features like automatic data conversion, enhanced stability, and sophisticated administrative tools. This wasn’t just an update; it was a complete reimagining of the game.</p>



<p>But V5 had a different legal history. In the ’90s, there had been commercial arrangements. Would Adam agree to GPL this version too?</p>



<p>His response: <em>“I have no issues with applying a new GPL license to Version 5 as well.”</em></p>



<h2 id="cp-md-0-chapter-5-the-missing-piece-postscript-magic"><a href="https://cryptpad.fr/#cp-md-0-chapter-5-the-missing-piece-postscript-magic"></a>Chapter 5: The Missing Piece – PostScript Magic</h2>



<p>Just when I thought the story was complete, I discovered another contributor: MaF, who had created PostScript utilities for generating printable game maps – a crucial feature in the pre-GUI era when players needed physical printouts to strategize.</p>



<div><p>Tracking down MaF in 2025 led me to his company, where he’s now Director of Product Security. His response: <em>“Oh, that was a long time ago. But yes, that was me. And I have no problem with relicensing it to GPL.”</em></p><p><strong>Richard Caley: More Than Just a Legal Footnote</strong></p></div>



<p>But not all searches end with an answer. Some end with silence.</p>



<p>My investigation of Richard Caley followed the same digital breadcrumbs. I traced him to the University of Edinburgh, where he worked on speech synthesis. I found his technical contributions to FreeBSD. But the trail went cold around 2005.</p>



<p>Then I found him – not in a USENET archive, but on the front page of his own website, preserved exactly as he left it in web.archive.org.</p>



<p><em>“Richard Caley suffered a fatal heart attack on the 22nd of April, 2005. He was only 41, but had been an undiagnosed diabetic, probably for some considerable time. His web pages remain as he left them.”</em></p>



<p>Reading those words felt different from finding a historical record. This wasn’t archival research – this was walking into someone’s house years after they’d gone and finding a note on the table.</p>



<p>The page continued:</p>



<p><em>“Over and above his tremendous ability with computers and programming, Richard had a keen mind and knowledge of an extraordinary range of topics, both of which he used in frequent contributions to on-line discussions. Despite his unique approach to speling, his prolific contributions to various news group debates informed and amused many over the years.”</em></p>



<p><strong>The “Caleyisms” – The Man Behind the Code</strong></p>



<p>And then I discovered his “Caleyisms” – a curated collection of his most brilliant USENET responses that revealed not just a programmer, but a person:</p>



<p><em>What’s a shell suit?</em></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Oil company executive.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>How do you prepare for a pyroclastic flow hitting Edinburgh?</em></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Hang 1000 battered Mars bars on strings and stand back?”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>On his book addiction:</em></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I never got the hang of libraries, they keep wanting the things back and get upset when they need a crowbar to force it out of my hands.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>His humor was dry, intelligent, and uniquely British. In technical discussions, he could be brutally precise:</p>



<p><em>“Lack of proper punctuation, spacing, line breaks, capitalisation etc. is like bad handwriting, it doesn’t make it impossible to read what was written, just harder. But you probably write in green crayon anyway.”</em></p>



<p><strong>A Digital Office Preserved</strong></p>



<p>Exploring his preserved website felt like walking through his digital office. The directory structure revealed his passions: FreeBSD how-tos, POVRAY experiments, wallpaper images, technical projects. His self-deprecating humor shone through in his “About” section:</p>



<p><em>“Thankfully I don’t have a photograph to inflict on you. Just use the picture of Iman Bowie to the left and then imagine someone who looks exactly the opposite in every possible way. This probably explains why she is married to David Bowie and I’m not.”</em></p>



<p>Here was a complete person – technical director at Interactive Information Ltd, speech synthesis researcher, FreeBSD enthusiast, Kate Bush fan, and a wit who brightened countless online discussions.</p>



<p>The legal reality was harsh: Richard’s contributions to Conquer couldn’t be relicensed. The university couldn’t help contact heirs due to privacy laws.</p>



<div><p>His friends had preserved his memory with a simple ASCII tribute at the end of his page:</p></div>



<pre>      ^_^<br>     (O O) <br>     \_/@@\<br>      \\~~/ <br>        ~~<br>               - RJC RIP<br></pre>



<p>In the Conquer project documentation, Richard Caley isn’t remembered as a “problem case” or “unlicensable code.” He’s honored as the vibrant person he was – the brilliant mind behind the “Caleyisms,” the researcher who contributed to speech synthesis, the FreeBSD advocate, and the witty participant in early online communities whose words continue to amuse and inform, decades after he wrote them.</p>



<h2 id="cp-md-0-chapter-6-modern-renaissance-enter-melange">Chapter 6: Modern Renaissance – Enter GitHub, CICD and Modern Distributions</h2>

<p>Here’s where the story gets really interesting. While working on preserving these Unix classics, I decided to learn modern packaging techniques. I chose to implement both <strong>APK (Alpine Linux)</strong> and <strong>Debian</strong> packaging for the games.</p>



<p>For APK packages, I used <strong>Melange</strong> – a sophisticated build system that creates provenance-tracked, reproducible packages for the Wolfi “undistro”. The irony? I discovered this tool when some friend started to work for the company that created it.<img decoding="async" src="blob:https://sandbox.cryptpad.info/05b5f619-e6f1-4ad4-b677-8b91f59dd1ec" alt=""></p>

<p>The transformation has been remarkable:</p>



<p><strong>1987 Original:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Distributed as split USENET posts</li>



<li>Manual compilation with system-specific Makefiles</li>



<li>No version control or automated testing</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>2025 Revival:</strong></p>



<pre><code># Modern CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- name: Build APK package
  run: melange build conquer.yaml
- name: Build Debian package  
  run: dpkg-buildpackage -b
</code></pre>



<p><strong>Key Modern Additions:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>GPLv3 relicensing</strong></li>



<li><strong>Make building system modernization</strong></li>



<li><strong>C Codebase partially updated to support modern ANSI C99 specification</strong></li>



<li><strong>Debian packaging</strong></li>



<li><strong>APK packaging with Melange</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>You can see the complete transformation in the repositories:</p>

<p>Conquer Version 5 – The evolution of the classical Conquer, by Adam Bryant</p>

<p>This isn’t just about preserving old games – it’s about preserving the <strong>story of computing itself</strong>. Ed Barlow and Adam Bryant were pioneers who built sophisticated multiplayer experiences when most people had never heard of the internet. They distributed software through USENET because that’s what you did – you shared cool things with the community.</p>



<p>Martin Forssen’s PostScript utilities represent the ingenuity of early developers who solved problems with whatever tools were available. Want to visualize your game state? Write a PostScript generator!</p>



<p><strong>The 20-year relicensing effort demonstrates something crucial about open source:</strong> it’s not just about code, it’s about <strong>community and continuity</strong>. Every time someone maintains a legacy project, documents its history, or tracks down long-lost contributors, they’re weaving the threads that connect computing’s past to its future.</p>



<h2 id="cp-md-0-lessons-for-modern-developers"><a href="https://cryptpad.fr/#cp-md-0-lessons-for-modern-developers"></a>Lessons for Modern Developers</h2>



<ol>
<li><strong>Document everything</strong>: Those casual USENET posts became crucial legal evidence decades later</li>



<li><strong>License clearly</strong>: Ed’s comment that “copyleft didnt exist when i wrote it” highlights how licensing landscapes evolve</li>



<li><strong>Community matters</strong>: Adam found my articles because the community was talking about preservation</li>



<li><strong>Technical debt is temporal</strong>: What seems like legacy tech today might be tomorrow’s archaeological treasure</li>



<li><strong>Modern tools can revive ancient code</strong>: Melange and modern CI/CD gave 1987 software a 2025 renaissance</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="cp-md-0-the-continuing-story"><a href="https://cryptpad.fr/#cp-md-0-the-continuing-story"></a>The Continuing Story</h2>



<p>Both Conquer games are now fully GPL v3 licensed and available with modern packaging. They represent not just playable software, but a complete case study in software archaeology, legal frameworks for preservation, and the evolution of development practices across four decades.</p>



<p>The next chapter? Teaching these classic strategy games to a new generation of developers and gamers, while demonstrating that proper legal frameworks and modern tooling can give any historical software a second life.</p>
