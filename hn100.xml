<h2 id="high-level-thoughts">High level thoughts</h2>
<p>This game is tiny! It takes 45 seconds, has no ambitions to be longer, and is based on a joke. I love it.</p>

<p>After the UI complexity and lack of a theme in <a href="https://eieio.games/game-diary/game-5-reshape-td">ReShape</a> it was refreshing to make something so limited. The scope of the game was perfect for learning a bit about the PICO-8 (and the PICO-8 probably pushed me to make a game of this scope, which is also great).</p>

<p>I think the gameplay itself is…fine? It’s kinda hard, but not that hard, and the strong theme + short length means that you’re probably gonna finish the game if you start it. This is the most arcadey game that I’ve built and it’s been really fun to get messages from friends with their high scores. At the time of writing the high score from a friend is 21 (mine is 26 but that was a freak accident).</p>

<p>This is also my first <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8</a> game! I loved some parts of the PICO-8 experience and did not like some of the others. But on the whole I’m happy that I gave it a try and I’m excited to make some more PICO-8 games this year.</p>

<h2 id="wait-the-pico-what">Wait, the PICO-what?</h2>
<p>A tl;dr of the PICO-8: it’s a “fantasy console<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>” with restrictions on graphics, sound, code size, and processor speed that mimic the consoles of the 80s. You can create sprites/music/sound effects and write code straight from the console.</p>

<div>
    
    <p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/dvdlogo/comfypico.png" alt=""></p><p> A comfy little PICO-8 terminal </p>
    
</div>

<p>The tools that the PICO-8 gives you are pleasantly simple but also primitive relative to modern game engines; if you want collision or particle effects you’re gonna have to manually handle collision on a pixel-by-pixel basis and <a href="https://trasevol.dog/2017/04/04/doodle-insights-11-particles/">draw your particles by hand</a>. This simplicity is the point - constraints breed creativity and all that. And a fun side effect of these limitations is that PICO-8 games have a distinct and relatively consistent feel.</p>

<p>The most well-known PICO-8 game is likely the original version of <a href="https://www.celestegame.com/">Celeste</a>, which was made in the PICO-8 for a gamejam. The PICO-8 version of Celeste is playable as an easter egg in the real game! Check it out if you haven’t.</p>


<p>The PICO-8 comes with some built in tools:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A sprite editor. I found myself missing Aseprite a bit, but being able to edit sprites directly from the PICO was great! I may try using Asperite with the PICO in the future but it’s not a sure thing.</li>
  <li>A sound effect editor. I found the editor wildly unintuitive until I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwFcitLtCsA">this Gruber video</a> and then got the hang of it pretty quickly. It’s neat and I’m excited to play with it again.</li>
  <li>A music editor. I am too used to playing the keyboard to find it super pleasant, but the editor is relatively intuitive (and would be hard to swap out with how the PICO does music).</li>
  <li>A code editor that I absolutely cannot stand oh my goodness<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<div>
    
    <p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/dvdlogo/pico-editor.png" alt=""></p><p> The lines don't get longer if you make the editor wider. The font just grows. </p>
    
</div>

<p>Fortunately to swap out the code editor I just:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Installed the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PollywogGames.pico8-ls">pico8-ls</a> extension for vscode, which gave me nice syntax highlighting and an API reference.</li>
  <li>Changed the code in my main pico8 file to just be <code>include code.pb</code> and wrote all of my code in <code>code.pb</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Step 2 is necessary because the PICO-8 stores sprite / music data in the same file that it stores code - I didn’t want to be editing the same file from vscode and the PICO-8.</p>

<p>I ended up pretty happy with this setup. My only gripe is that I need an easier-to-search PICO-8 language reference; <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html">this manual</a> is hard to search because there’s no way to limit your search to, say, just function names.</p>

<h2 id="the-pico-8-environment-vibes">The PICO-8 environment: vibes</h2>
<p>It felt super natural to ship a game this small on the PICO-8. I loved that!</p>

<p>During development I considered all sorts of extensions - for example, maybe you could collect tokens that gave you more time, or you could upgrade your TV / your DVD logo to make it easier to score points, or maybe there could be enemies that were trying to bump the logo. Maybe this game was actually meant to be a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/">Vampire Survivors</a> clone!</p>

<p>And I think if I was writing in Godot I might have given into more of those impulses (or at least tried them out). This game is so simple! Games are meant to have decisions and complexity and choices! It’d be silly to put the game up on itch in this state!</p>

<p>But the PICO-8 is so simple that it felt totally natural to ship this game as-is; I felt as though the simplicity of the console gave me permission to do something simple. Of course I’ve always had that permission. But sometimes it’s nice to have a push.</p>

<p>I’m excited to revisit the PICO-8 and that push is a big reason why.</p>

<h2 id="its-great-to-have-a-theme-again">It’s great to have a theme again</h2>
<p>As a game <em>player</em> I sometimes skip through themes to get to mechanics. As a kid I’d skip cutscenes; I’ve played hundreds of hours of <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/">Path of Exile</a> but absolutely cannot explain the story. This isn’t always true - my favorite game is <em>easily</em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/">Outer Wilds</a> and that’s as much due to the story as the mechanics - but it’s often true.</p>

<p>And so when <em>making</em> games I sometimes talk myself into thinking that a theme isn’t that important. This was certainly true with <a href="https://eieio.games/game-diary/game-5-reshape-td">ReShape TD</a> and probably also with <a href="https://eieio.games/game-diary/game-4-click-click-trick-ppjjgg">click, click, trick</a>. Both games have some neat mechanics but it’s hard to explain what the games are <em>about.</em></p>

<p>“Put the DVD Logo in the Corner” is the exact opposite and I think that’s <em>great</em>. There is a single mechanic in this game and it is “make a square land in the corner of a bigger rectangle.” Not a very exciting mechanic! But I’ve had more fun telling folks about this game than anything else I’ve made - and that’s all because of the theme.</p>

<p>I’ll do my best to keep that in mind for future games.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>That’s it! I had a lot of fun making this game and working with the PICO-8. I’m interested in building some more small arcade-feeling games and looking forward to returning to the PICO.</p>

<p>Right now I’m toying with a game that relies entirely on an (ab)use of the <a href="https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch">OpenSearch spec</a> to build something that runs entirely from the Firefox address bar. I’ll probably get back to something more, uh, traditional next.</p>

<p><em>An update from the future (2024-07-05):</em> I ended using OpenSearch to <a href="https://eieio.games/nonsense/implementing-wordle-in-the-firefox-address-bar/">run Wordle in the Firefox address bar</a>. And I can’t say I’ve made a lot of traditional stuff since then :)</p>

                  <p>Absolutely. Of late I have an iOS app to measure the grade of hills. Initially this was to avoid parking tickets in San Francisco which requires curbing your tires for a 3% grade. The reality is that this is basically no grade and you should just curb no matter what in SF. Still fun to know how steep the hills are when walking.
The other one is to set the exif data on photos to be taken in Pyongyang 100m underground tomorrow. This me is probably going to get me and my friends in trouble with the NSA for messing up their database, but these things happen.</p>

I subsequently used two versions of it in client projects (to prototype some solutions and to compile them to data used by the delivered product; nothing delivered to the clients depended on my weird Lisp dialect).</p><p>I wrote a tool called nym to help generate names for characters and other things in games and stories. It's enough fun in itself that I sometimes just play with it.</p><p>I wrote another tool called model-namegen to generate names with stricter constraints for science-fiction stories. Those names are mapped uniquely and reversibly to 64-bit integers used in the story to generate names for machine intelligences. I also wrote a prototype for a 3D multiplayer game called The Fabric set in the world of those stories, and wrote code to generate clusters of colored cubes for use as avatars representing the AIs. Each character's unique ID is mapped to a unique name and also to a unique 8x8x8 configuration of lighted cubes. An example name is Ixion Eleven Chrysotile, the name of the autonomous robot who is the narrator of my Fabric stories.</p><p>Following is a link to a very short movie of the avatar for the character Miriam Five Bittersweet Earth:

They're called folio and folio2.</p><p>I wrote a library called taps that similarly makes use of Richard Waters' SERIES package for Common Lisp a bit more convenient for me.

For example, beasties was a pond-life simulation that I used as a playground for recreational genetic programming. Panels was an experiment in user interface that used a constraint solver for laying out windows and widgets, and an append-only log of all UI events together with a query engine and a knowledgebase. Panels could display graphic representations of recent user activity and retroactively define mappings from sequences of events to user-defined handlers. It operated on the principle that everything detectable that a user did potentially had some purpose, even if we don't know what it is, so we should remember all the user's actions and offer them the opportunity to define what they meant.</p><p>I've also written a few little things primarily for the purpose of helping friends and family with this or that task.</p><p>I've spent a lot of time over the years on things like these. As you would expect, they've taken varying amounts of time and I don't really keep track of how much. I use some of them (e.g. taps and other pieces of folio) almost every day, and others intermittently. A few of them (such as beasties and panels) I haven't really touched in years now.</p></div></td></tr>

The second script then wraps youtube-dl and redirects to the raw video URL obtained for that video ID by youtube-dl.</p><p>This worked great for years, but recently, YouTube stopped serving their `22` format for most videos, which coupled 720p video with the audio stream.  Now, the best resolution you can get with audio and video interleaved is `18`, which contains only 360p video.  So that's the best resolution obtainable this way for now, unless I add a whole layer to this to reconstruct an interleaved video from separate audio and video streams selected from the DASH manifest.</p></div></td></tr>

I'm using it as part of a video game decompilation project, but it also enables a whole bunch of other use cases I've documented on my blog.</p><p>It's not that it is meant for my use only (any capable reverse-engineer familiar with Ghidra should be able to pick it up and use it) nor that it will never see the light of the day (it's open-source). However, it is such an esoteric capability and outright heresy according to computer sciences that I'm having a hard time just finding people who can wrap their heads around the concept, let alone people who would actually want to use this. Simply put, it's so far out there that I don't even know where or how I could even advertise it in the first place, which makes it <i>de facto</i> for my own use only.</p><p>A couple of people did end up reaching out to me in the last couple of weeks about it, so it might be on the cusp of sprouting a very tiny user base.

                  <p>Something like that really deserves to be written in C so you don't need to install Ghidra to use it. The way I imagine it working is if I want the function `foo` then I'd say `objsuck -ffoo -ofoo.o prog.elf` and it'd look at the elf symbol table to find the `.size` of `foo` and copy that symbol into the .o. I guess you would then need to use xed to disassemble the opcodes to see what other symbols it jumps into or calls, and grab those too, along with any memory references, and then emit relocations. Overall I support this, since it'd be the easiest way to expropriate content from open source codebases whose source code is too byzantine to let me extract one teensy tiny little feature without the bloat. To me this is perfectly normal. You'd also be smart to only support COFF if the person uploads the binary to a hosted service you control and pays you money. In fact this would be even better if it could generate .s files from the object content, so no one would get triggered by binaries.</p>

Using a barcode scanner, we can quickly "check in" books on return day, accompanied by an adorable "ding ding!" sound recorded by one of my kids. Really beats manually searching the paper printout. It can be used on multiple devices at the same time - the checkin status of each book is synced live between all users, so each kid can find and check in their own books.</p><p><i>School/Home Lunch Manager:</i> Displays the school lunch menu alongside each of my kids’ names. We mark school/home lunch days at the start of the week for easy morning prep.</p><p><i>Sickness Documentation:</i> Tracks sickness details like symptoms, medication, temperatures, and timelines, helping us coordinate how we are going to take care of the kids when they are sick.</p><p>These apps, along with a few others not listed here, run on a server in my home, accessible only within our network (in home of via a VPN).</p></div></td></tr>

A single, dial the weight dumbbell. Plates in metal range from 10 lbs to 0.25 lbs.</p><p>The SW:</p><p>1) using SQLite for DB</p><p>2) One application to calculate optimum weight settings - typical run takes 100 to 200 tries to get the best set.</p><p>3) Another application to present / track sessions.  It was a BIG timer display to ensure I do not do the workout too fast (goal is 45 sec a set)</p><p>4) A tracking report.</p><p>Complexity issues:
Not all dumbbell handles weigh the same - even the tightening nuts vary.  Solution was to weigh everything and pair up the nuts so that each dumbbell handle with nuts matched its pair - oh I color coded the metal dumbbell handles.</p><p>First algorithm took too long - my first version would calculate ALL combinations of all weights.  Then select the optimal solution - before adding the 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 pound plates would take between 15 to 30 minutes to run.  This was solved with a slightly more complex algorithm.  I calculated the all combinations for each dumbbell.  Merged those lists into a big list, Found the perfect setting for each exercise.  Check for conflicts.  When a conflict occurred, found the exercise with the least delta from optimal and changed it to the next weight setting.... Check for conflict.  Now it takes no more than 20 sec and reports 100 to 200 times it hit conflict before solving.</p></div></td></tr>

I am very self-conscious of publishing my work. So over the years i have made many software games and utilities that will never be published. My wife thinks i am being silly and i shoud publish it. Anyway, here goes....</p><p>MP3Renamer(2002) - The age of music piracy is still rife and i have downloaded my share from napster, university file shares, etc. However, most filenames are horrendous and not clean. So, my first utility was a java program that would analyse file names based on common garbled patterns and rename it into [Artist] - [Songname].mp3. It worked surprisingly well for 90% of the use cases,</p><p>CombatLogAnalyzer(2008) - Me and my wife are in the throes of World of Warcraft arena which is a competetive dueling system. We only play 2v2 and we both suck at it. So, i enabled combatlogs in WoW and then wrote a parser, analyser and visualizer for every arena game and that shows which spells were used, where did  damage come up, highest contributer of damage and this was by each playable class. By the end, we learnt what was killing us and the statistics showed our strengths and weaknesses. Suffering high latency and poor skills we managed to crawl from 800 rating to 1800 rating! We just couldnt go beyond that! (I was the crutch). This was done in .NET WinForms and i really learnt how to use linq.</p><p>Space Commander (2019) - My daughter is almost 4 years old and i think she is ready for computer games. I decide to learn MonoGame and i make a Space Commander clone. It is a HIT!</p><p>HappyMrsChicken (2019) - From my smash hit game above, i make a clone of HappyMrsChicken except this is in a forest where you have corn that the chicken has to eat and there is competetion from a mysterious goblin creature who also goes after the corn. Who will win?? Turns out, i cheated and gave the chicken a boost. My daughter won a lot!!</p><p>OptionsTrading (2020) - It is covid and i am locked in a quarantine facility for 28 days. Like a lot of retail noobs, we are getting into trading stocks and options. I decide IBKR interface sucks and I can do better. While spending those 28 days in isolation from family, i learn react to write a frontend and python to write a backend that displays all our trades, statistics, UIs, loss calculators, PnL, etc. My wife and I use this to date but i am too chicken-shit to publish it.</p><p>My personal favourites are: CombatLogAnalyser, OptionsTrading and HappyMrsChicken in that order</p></div></td></tr>

Ultimately I settled on multiple vim tabs in a terminal window. Been using this for close to five years now and I couldn’t be happier with it.

The bot as a whole was extremely complex and could interface with several external applications like google sheets and trello. It also had a very nice feature where it would answer my DMs for me. I was a pretty public figure in the community and got a lot of messages that would be better answered by just asking in the general chat. The bot would (respectfully) explain that I can't give 1:1 support to everyone and direct them to better support channels. It also explained that if something really did require my direct attention, I could still be reached by sending another message. Almost nobody ever did. I couldn't believe how effective it was. The DMs still existed in my inbox, but the bot marked them as read so I wouldn't get notified. I'd review them occasionally, I never found any false positives.</p><p>But of course that kind of thing is ancient history and will get your discord account banned nowadays. Using a bot to log in as a normal user has been prohibited for a long time. Too bad.</p></div></td></tr>

Two large ones off the top of my head.</p><p>First one: cloud services are expensive and come with a lot of overhead. However I do enjoy the idea of lambda/cloud functions a lot but I didn't want to rely on cloud services for them, especially since I have a ton of hardware to self-host stuff. So I built a service which piggybacks on DIND where I could add templates for such lambdas for a few languages(just rust and python cause that's mostly what I use) where I can allocate some resources and build tiny containers. In order to avoid wasting resources, they are all off by default but through the magic of what I build(management and something like a reverse proxy + container management for DIND), I can call an endpoint, which will check if there is a container to handle the requests and proxies the request and response to and from it or it will spin up the container, do the same and shut it down after a pre-defined amount of time. You could argue that I could have achieved the same with minikube or k3s but this has proven to use a lot more resources compared to a single rust binary I can run on anything x86 with docker on it. The downsides are that I can't distribute it across multiple servers so it only runs locally. But that fits my needs perfectly. There might be some people that would be interested in it but I never got to open sourcing it so I'm the only user. I've been planning to open source it "next week" for the past 2 years or so.</p><p>Second one: I love data. Specifically unstructured, raw data and I've been collecting a ton of articles from the internet over the past 2 years or so. The ingestion involves a pipeline that automatically processes them and extracts data/makes them a lot less unstructured: events, locations, timestamps, what has happened where and all that jazz. It's a long list of ml models, data transformations, validations, 3 llm's fighting each-other and a bunch of other stuff. Kinda feels like a child to me so I don't want to open source it. I know that I could hypothetically convert it into a product and make some money off it but my past entrepreneurial experiences have been very unsuccessful, I have limited time and lack motivation. So at the moment I'm simply enjoying the data getting spit out on a grafana dashboard such as this [1].</p><p>[1] <a href="https://i.imgur.com/fAoQghk.png" rel="nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/fAoQghk.png</a></p></div></td></tr>

I'd been looking for an excuse to learn Haskell and figured the best way to stay motivated was to make useful tool for myself.</p><p>I've been working on it for the better part of a year at this point (probably &gt;200 hours) and I use it roughly daily. After gathering a few months of station-level data it became clear enough that the system (specifically, how the e-bikes are handled) has some pretty serious issues.</p><p>I ended up sending the city a couple of freedom of information requests for some data I was missing and for the contract between them and the company that operates the system. The contract says that the operator gets paid a fee for every dead e-bike they move to a charging station - regardless of whether or not that bike actually manages to charge.</p><p>The city owns around 2000 e-bikes and there are frequently times where a whopping <i>20</i> are available - the rest are out of battery, sitting in docking stations for multiple days. Occasionally the operator shuffle the bikes over to the handful electrified charging stations, and about half the time the bikes don't charge (they just completely fill the stations, meaning nobody can use them - one of those stations happens to be right outside my partner's place). Then 4-7 days later they come around in a truck and get rid of the bikes, and the whole cycle repeats again in a couple days.</p><p>Basically, we're getting fleeced by the system operator. It isn't even clear to me if it's intentional or not, or just the usual combination of lax municipal oversight and an apathetic operator.</p><p>I've been meaning to send my data and the contract over to a few reporters who care about that sort of thing, since (a) the bike share system is genuinely a great way to get around (when it works) and (b) financially it's really good value for the city [1], and I'd like to see the problems fixed (especially given that the city is planning on massively expanding the e-bike fleet).</p><p>[0]: General Bikeshare Feed Specification: <a href="https://github.com/MobilityData/gbfs">https://github.com/MobilityData/gbfs</a></p><p>[1]: The per-trip subsidy is $0.67, versus $4.08 for a trip on our transit system (!)</p></div></td></tr>

Then again, maybe not. Having been a maintainer for a project with hundreds of contributors before, I can say that coding for oneself feels very liberating. Only as much infrastructure and process as necessary to get the job done. No need to deal with feature requests or bug reports. No commit races, or battles in code-review comments. You know the requirements perfectly (or have a perfectly compliant customer who is willing to change) so if you want to take a short cut you can. I was often a stickler for doing things "the right way" when I was working, but part of the reason I left is that my work seemed to be <i>all</i> about shepherding the process and not the joy of making code grow and do new things. Having total freedom on a project, even a small one, is good balm for a jaded programmer's soul.</p></div></td></tr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gla.ac.uk/media/Media_1086641_smxx.jpg" alt="Antikythera mechanism in National Archaeological Museum, Athens, Greece." title="" width="650" height="433"></p><p>&nbsp;The mechanism was discovered in 1901 by divers exploring a sunken shipwreck near the Aegean island of Antikythera. Although the shoebox-sized mechanism had broken into fragments and eroded, it quickly became clear that it contained a complex series of gears which were unusually intricately-tooled. </p><p>&nbsp;Decades of subsequent research and analysis have established that the mechanism dates from the second century BCE and functioned as a kind of hand-operated mechanical computer. Exterior dials connected to the internal gears allowed users to predict eclipses and calculate the astronomical positions of planets on any given date with an accuracy unparalleled by any other known contemporary device.</p><p>&nbsp;In 2020, new X-ray images of one of the mechanism’s rings, known as the calendar ring, revealed fresh details of regularly spaced holes that sit beneath the ring. Since the ring was broken and incomplete, however, it wasn’t clear how just how many holes were there originally. Initial analysis by Antikythera researcher Chris Budiselic and colleagues suggested it was likely somewhere between 347 and 367.</p><p>&nbsp;Now, in a new paper published today in the <em>Horological Journal</em>, the Glasgow researchers describe how they used two statistical analysis techniques to reveal new details about the calendar ring. They show that the ring is vastly more likely to have had 354 holes, corresponding to the lunar calendar, than 365 holes, which would have followed the Egyptian calendar. The analysis also shows that 354 holes is hundreds of times more probable than a 360-hole ring, which previous research had suggested as a possible count. </p><p>&nbsp;Professor Graham Woan, of the University of Glasgow’s School of Physics &amp; Astronomy, is one of the authors of the paper. He said: “Towards the end of last year, a colleague pointed to me to data acquired by YouTuber Chris Budiselic, who was looking to make a replica of the calendar ring and was investigating ways to determine just how many holes it contained. </p><p>&nbsp;“It struck me as an interesting problem, and one that I thought I might be able to solve in a different way during the Christmas holidays, so I set about using some statistical techniques to answer the question.”</p><p>&nbsp;Professor Woan used a technique called Bayesian analysis, which uses probability to quantify uncertainty based on incomplete data, to calculate the likely number of holes in the mechanism using the positions of the surviving holes and the placement of the ring’s surviving six fragments. His results showed strong evidence that the mechanism’s calendar ring contained either 354 or 355 holes.</p><p>&nbsp;At the same time, one of Professor Woan’s colleagues at the University’s Institute for Gravitational Research, Dr Joseph Bayley, had also heard about the problem. He adapted techniques used by their research group to analyse the signals picked up by the LIGO gravitational wave detectors, which measure the tiny ripples in spacetime, caused by massive astronomical events like the collision of black holes, as they pass through the Earth, to scrutinise the calendar ring.</p><p>&nbsp;The Markov Chain Monte Carlo and nested sampling methods Woan and Bayley used provided a comprehensive probabilistic set of results, again suggested that the ring most likely contained 354 or 355 holes in a circle of radius 77.1mm, with an uncertainty of about 1/3 mm. It also reveals that the holes were precisely positioned with extraordinary accuracy, with an average radial variation of just 0.028mm between each hole.</p><p>&nbsp;Bayley, a co-author of the paper, is a research associate at the School of Physics &amp; Astronomy. He said: “Previous studies had suggested that the calendar ring was likely to have tracked the lunar calendar, but the dual techniques we’ve applied in this piece of work greatly increase the likelihood that this was the case. </p><p>&nbsp;“It’s given me a new appreciation for the Antikythera mechanism and the work and care that Greek craftspeople put into making it – the precision of the holes’ positioning would have required highly accurate measurement techniques and an incredibly steady hand to punch them.</p><p>&nbsp;Professor Woan added: “It’s a neat symmetry that we’ve adapted techniques we use to study the universe today to understand more about a mechanism that helped people keep track of the heavens nearly two millennia ago. </p><p>&nbsp;“We hope that our findings about the Antikythera mechanism, although less supernaturally spectacular than those made by Indiana Jones, will help deepen our understanding of how this remarkable device was made and used by the Greeks.”</p><p>&nbsp;The paper, titled ‘<a href="https://bhi.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/07-HJJuly24-AOTM-2.pdf">An Improved Calendar Ring Hole-Count for the Antikythera Mechanism: A Fresh Analysis</a>’, is published in <em>Horological Journal.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>
