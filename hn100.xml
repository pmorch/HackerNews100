The scope of the combined project expanded beyond tracing to cover all of observability. OTEL's mission is to help organizations deliver </span><strong>high-quality, ubiquitous, and portable telemetry.</strong></p><p>Four years later, OTEL is making good on its promise. It has to date provided a stable standard for the three pillars of observability (metrics, logs, and traces), a collector that can receive, process, and export telemetry in any environment, and SDKs to instrument code in all major languages. It has also continued to expand its scope and introduced additional standards around semantic conventions and agent management.</p><p>Today, OTEL is the second most active project in the CNCF, behind only Kubernetes in popularity. Its contributors are spread across all major observability vendors and its protocol has near-universal adoption among observability providers.</p><p>In this post, we'll go over where OTEL is today, provide a summary of the various projects that fall under its domain, and talk about where it's going next.</p><p>OTEL consists mainly of two types of projects: specifications and implementations.</p><p>Specifications are the foundation of OTEL. They describe how telemetry should be captured, collected, processed, and exported. Specifications tend to be vendor-focused as they define the common standard that vendors have to implement to be compatible with OTEL.</p><p>Implementations are the specific client libraries and tooling that are used to handle telemetry data. Implementations tend to be end-user-focused as they consist of the parts that end-users use to instrument their code.</p><p>A project's stability is typically marked on a signal-by-signal basis. Each signal is a specific type of telemetry data - in OTEL, this means metrics, logs, and traces.</p><p>OTEL today consists of the following sub-projects:</p><ul><li><p>OpenTelemetry Specification (specification)</p></li><li><p>OpenTelemetry SDKs (implementation)</p></li><li><p>OpenTelemetry Protocol (specification)</p></li><li><p>OpenTelemetry Collector (implementation)</p></li><li><p>Open Agent Management Protocol (specification)</p></li><li><p>OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions (specification)</p></li></ul><p><span>The </span><a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/overview/" rel="">Open Telemetry specification</a><span> is the foundation of OTEL - it provides the APIs, SDKs, and data models that all other OTEL standards are derived from.</span></p><p>A brief timeline of its development:</p><ul><li><p><span>2020-09: Tracing marked </span><a href="https://medium.com/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-collector-achieves-tracing-stability-milestone-80e34cadbbf5" rel="">stable</a></p></li><li><p><span>2021-11: Metrics marked </span><a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/pull/2104" rel="">stable</a></p></li><li><p><span>2023-04: Logs marked </span><a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/pull/3376" rel="">stable</a></p></li></ul><p><span>In terms of maturity, the OTEL spec is now </span><strong>stable for all signals</strong><span>. Because the logging signal was not deemed stable until earlier this year, many OTEL SDKs still do not support logging at this time.</span></p><p><span>The </span><a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/" rel="">OTEL SDKs</a><span> provide client-side instrumentation based on the OTEL spec.

<p>If a thermometer is wrapped in a water-moistened cloth, it will behave differently. The drier and less humid the air is, the faster the water will evaporate.  The faster water evaporates, the lower the thermometer's temperature will be relative to air temperature.
</p><p>Water can evaporate only if the air around it can absorb more water. This is measured by comparing how much water is in the air to the maximum that could be in the air—the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_humidity" title="Relative humidity">relative humidity</a>. 0% means the air is completely dry, and 100% means the air contains all the water it can hold in the present circumstances and it cannot absorb any more water (from any source).
</p><p>This is part of the cause of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_temperature" title="Apparent temperature">apparent temperature</a> in humans. The drier the air, the more moisture it can take up beyond what is already in it, and the easier it is for extra water to evaporate. The result is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat" title="Sweat">sweat</a> evaporates more quickly in drier air, cooling down the skin faster. If the relative humidity is 100%, no water can evaporate, and cooling by sweating or evaporation is not possible.
</p><p>When relative humidity is 100%, a wet-bulb thermometer can also no longer be cooled by evaporation, so it will read the same as an unwrapped thermometer.

<p>The wet-bulb temperature is the lowest temperature that may be achieved by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporative_cooling" title="Evaporative cooling">evaporative cooling</a> of a water-wetted, ventilated surface.
</p><p>By contrast, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point" title="Dew point">dew point</a> is the temperature to which the ambient air must be cooled to reach 100% <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_humidity" title="Relative humidity">relative humidity</a> assuming there is no further evaporation into the air; it is the temperature where condensation (dew) and clouds would form.
</p><p>For a parcel of air that is less than saturated (i.e., air with less than 100 percent relative humidity), the wet-bulb temperature is lower than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry-bulb_temperature" title="Dry-bulb temperature">dry-bulb temperature</a>, but higher than the dew point temperature. The lower the relative humidity (the drier the air), the greater the gaps between each pair of these three temperatures. Conversely, when the relative humidity rises to 100%, the three figures coincide.
</p><p>For air at a known pressure and dry-bulb temperature, the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature corresponds to unique values of the relative humidity and the dew point temperature. It therefore may be used for the practical determination of these values. The relationships between these values are illustrated in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychrometric_chart" title="Psychrometric chart">psychrometric chart</a>.
</p><p>Lower wet-bulb temperatures that correspond with drier air in summer can translate to energy savings in air-conditioned buildings due to:

<p>The thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature is the temperature a volume of air would have if cooled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_process" title="Adiabatic process">adiabatically</a> to saturation by evaporation of water into it, all latent heat being supplied by the volume of air.
</p><p>The temperature of an air sample that has passed over a large surface of liquid water in an insulated channel is the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature—the air has become saturated by passing through a constant-pressure, ideal, adiabatic saturation chamber.
</p><p>Meteorologists and others may use the term "isobaric wet-bulb temperature" to refer to the "thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature".  It is also called the "adiabatic saturation temperature", though meteorologists also use "adiabatic saturation temperature" to mean "temperature at the saturation level", i.e. the temperature the parcel would achieve if it expanded adiabatically until saturated.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>The thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_properties" title="Thermodynamic properties">thermodynamic property</a> of a mixture of air and water vapor.

<p>Wet-bulb temperature is measured using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometer" title="Thermometer">thermometer</a> that has its bulb wrapped in cloth—called a <i>sock</i>—that is kept wet with distilled water via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_action" title="Capillary action">wicking</a> action. Such an instrument is called a <i>wet-bulb thermometer.</i>  A widely used device for measuring wet- and dry-bulb temperature is a <i>sling psychrometer</i>, which consists of a pair of mercury bulb thermometers, one with a wet "sock" to measure the wet-bulb temperature and the other with the bulb exposed and dry for the dry-bulb temperature.  The thermometers are attached to a swivelling handle, which allows them to be whirled around so that water evaporates from the sock and cools the wet bulb until it reaches <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_equilibrium" title="Thermal equilibrium">thermal equilibrium</a>.
</p><p>An actual wet-bulb thermometer reads a temperature that is slightly different from the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature, but they are very close in value. This is due to a coincidence: for a water-air system the psychrometric ratio (see below) happens to be close to 1, although for systems other than air and water they might not be close.
</p><p>To understand why this is so, first consider the calculation of the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature.
</p><p><b>Experiment 1</b>
</p><p>In this case, a stream of unsaturated air is cooled. The heat from cooling that air is used to evaporate some water which increases the humidity of the air. At some point the air becomes saturated with water vapor (and has cooled to the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature). In this case we can write the following balance of energy per mass of dry air:
</p><div><p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/17ec8c5c9e299adfec2713eeee94c3689d20ec67" aria-hidden="true" alt="{\displaystyle (H_{\mathrm {sat} }-H_{0})\cdot \lambda =(T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {sat} })\cdot c_{\mathrm {s} }}"></p></div>


<p><b>Experiment 2</b>
</p><p>For the case of the wet-bulb thermometer, imagine a drop of water with unsaturated air blowing over it. As long as the vapor pressure of water in the drop (function of its temperature) is greater than the partial pressure of water vapor in the air stream, evaporation will take place. Initially, the heat required for the evaporation will come from the drop itself.
</p><p>Instead, as the drop starts cooling, it is now colder than the air, so convective heat transfer begins to occur from the air to the drop. Furthermore, the evaporation rate depends on the difference of concentration of water vapor between the drop-stream interface and the distant stream (i.e. the "original" stream, unaffected by the drop), and on a convective mass transfer coefficient, which is a function of the components of the mixture (i.e. water and air).
</p><p>After a certain period, an equilibrium is reached: the drop has cooled to a point where the rate of heat carried away in evaporation is equal to the heat gain through convection. At this point, the following balance of energy per interface area is true:
</p><div><p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4c40fedb288cdbbc365da7082c3c92a522a0d542" aria-hidden="true" alt="{\displaystyle (H_{\mathrm {sat} }-H_{0})\cdot \lambda \cdot k'=(T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {eq} })\cdot h_{\mathrm {c} }}"></p></div>


<p>Note that:
</p>

<p>Let us rearrange that equation into:
</p><div><p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9677e02c0523e01c6c5fee890b3c60a34b1146ec" aria-hidden="true" alt="{\displaystyle (H_{\mathrm {sat} }-H_{0})\cdot \lambda =(T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {eq} })\cdot {\frac {h_{\mathrm {c} }}{k'}}}"></p></div>
<p>Now let's go back to our original "thermodynamic wet-bulb" experiment, Experiment 1. If the air stream is the same in both experiments (i.e. <span><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/43910602a221b7a4c373791f94793e3008622070" aria-hidden="true" alt="H_{0}"></span> and <span><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/55b9e7d7b96196b5a6a26f4349caa3ac82fd67e3" aria-hidden="true" alt="T_{0}"></span> are the same), then we can equate the right-hand sides of both equations:
</p><div><p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/963f05fa9fd90a71ff3e8d3eb21778fd8092f54b" aria-hidden="true" alt="{\displaystyle (T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {sat} })\cdot c_{\mathrm {s} }=(T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {eq} })\cdot {\frac {h_{\mathrm {c} }}{k'}}}"></p></div>
<p>Rearranging:
</p><div><p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2c6a080ad8026b95468628f27d101d9b053f475f" aria-hidden="true" alt="{\displaystyle T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {sat} }=(T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {eq} })\cdot {\frac {h_{\mathrm {c} }}{k'\cdot c_{\mathrm {s} }}}}"></p></div>
<p>If <span><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/138cb3443a730d751f0d02bef57f6645dade10c5" aria-hidden="true" alt="{\dfrac {h_{\mathrm {c} }}{k'c_{\mathrm {s} }}}=1"></span> then the temperature of the drop in Experiment 2 is the same as the wet-bulb temperature in Experiment 1. Due to a coincidence, for the mixture of air and water vapor this is the case, the ratio (called <i>psychrometric ratio</i>) being close to 1.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>Experiment 2 is what happens in a common wet-bulb thermometer, meaning that its reading is fairly close to the thermodynamic ("real") wet-bulb temperature.
</p><p>Experimentally, the wet-bulb thermometer reads closest to the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature if:
</p>
<ul><li>The sock is shielded from radiant heat exchange with its surroundings</li>
<li>Air flows past the sock quickly enough to prevent evaporated moisture from affecting evaporation from the sock</li>
<li>The water supplied to the sock is at the same temperature as the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature of the air</li></ul>
<p>In practice the value reported by a wet-bulb thermometer differs slightly from the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature because:
</p>
<ul><li>The sock is not perfectly shielded from radiant heat exchange</li>
<li>Air flow rate past the sock may be less than optimum</li>
<li>The temperature of the water supplied to the sock is not controlled</li></ul>
<p>At relative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity" title="Humidity">humidities</a> below 100 percent, water <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporates" title="Evaporates">evaporates</a> from the bulb, cooling it below ambient temperature. To determine relative humidity, ambient temperature is measured using an ordinary thermometer, better known in this context as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry-bulb_temperature" title="Dry-bulb temperature">dry-bulb thermometer</a>. At any given ambient temperature, less relative humidity results in a greater difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures; the wet-bulb is colder. The precise relative humidity is determined by reading from a  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychrometric_chart" title="Psychrometric chart">psychrometric chart</a> of wet-bulb versus dry-bulb temperatures, or by calculation.
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychrometer" title="Psychrometer">Psychrometers</a> are instruments with both a wet-bulb and a dry-bulb thermometer.
</p><p>A wet-bulb thermometer can also be used outdoors in sunlight in combination with a <i>globe thermometer</i> (which measures the incident <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_radiant_temperature" title="Mean radiant temperature">radiant temperature</a>) to calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_Bulb_Globe_Temperature" title="Wet Bulb Globe Temperature">Wet Bulb Globe Temperature</a> (WBGT).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-testid="paragraph-0">SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TSLA.O" target="_blank">(TSLA.O)</a> is set to defend itself for the first time at trial against allegations that failure of its Autopilot driver assistant feature led to death, in what will likely be a major test of Chief Executive Elon Musk's assertions about the technology.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-1">Self-driving capability is central to Tesla’s financial future, <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-says-tesla-likely-launch-full-self-drive-technology-this-year-2023-04-20/">according to Musk,</a> whose own reputation as an engineering leader is being challenged with allegations by plaintiffs in one of two lawsuits that he personally leads the group behind technology that failed. Wins by Tesla could raise confidence and sales for the software, which costs up to $15,000 per vehicle.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">Tesla faces two trials in quick succession, with more to follow.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-3">The first, scheduled for mid-September in a California state court, is a civil lawsuit containing allegations that the Autopilot system caused owner Micah Lee’s Model 3 to suddenly veer off a highway east of Los Angeles at 65 miles per hour, strike a palm tree and burst into flames, all in the span of seconds.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">The 2019 crash, which has not been previously reported, killed Lee and seriously injured his two passengers, including a then-8-year old boy who was disemboweled. The lawsuit, filed against Tesla by the passengers and Lee's estate, accuses Tesla of knowing that Autopilot and other safety systems were defective when it sold the car.</p><h2 data-testid="Heading">MUSK 'DE FACTO LEADER' OF AUTOPILOT TEAM</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-5">The second trial, set for early October in a Florida state court, arose out of a 2019 crash north of Miami where owner Stephen Banner’s Model 3 drove under the trailer of an 18-wheeler big rig truck that had pulled into the road, shearing off the Tesla's roof and killing Banner. Autopilot failed to brake, steer or do anything to avoid the collision, according to the lawsuit filed by Banner's wife.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">Tesla denied liability for both accidents, blamed driver error and said Autopilot is safe when monitored by humans. Tesla said in court documents that drivers must pay attention to the road and keep their hands on the steering wheel.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">"There are no self-driving cars on the road today," the company said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">The civil proceedings will likely reveal new evidence about what Musk and other company officials knew about Autopilot’s capabilities – and any possible deficiencies. Banner’s attorneys, for instance, argue in a pretrial court filing that internal emails show Musk is the Autopilot team's "de facto leader".</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">Tesla and Musk did not respond to Reuters’ emailed questions for this article, but Musk has made no secret of his involvement in self-driving software engineering, often tweeting about his test-driving of a Tesla equipped with "Full Self-Driving" software. He has for years promised that Tesla would achieve self-driving capability only to miss his own targets.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">Tesla <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-jury-set-decide-test-case-tesla-autopilot-crash-2023-04-21/">won a bellwether trial</a> in Los Angeles in April with a strategy of saying that it tells drivers that its technology requires human monitoring, despite the "Autopilot" and "Full Self-Driving" names. The case was about an accident where a Model S swerved into the curb and injured its driver, <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-autopilot-never-claimed-be-self-pilot-juror-2023-04-21/https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-autopilot-never-claimed-be-self-pilot-juror-2023-04-21/" target="_blank">and jurors told Reuters</a> after the verdict that they believed Tesla warned drivers about its system and driver distraction was to blame.</p><h2 data-testid="Heading">STAKES HIGHER FOR TESLA</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-11">The stakes for Tesla are much higher in the September and October trials, the first of a series related to Autopilot this year and next, because people died.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">"If Tesla backs up a lot of wins in these cases, I think they're going to get more favorable settlements in other cases," said Matthew Wansley, a former General Counsel of nuTonomy, an automated driving startup and Associate Professor of Law at Cardozo School of Law.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">On the other hand, "a big loss for Tesla - especially with a big damages award" could "dramatically shape the narrative going forward," said Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">In court filings, the company has argued that Lee consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel and that it is not clear whether Autopilot was on at the time of crash.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">Jonathan Michaels, an attorney for the plaintiffs, declined to comment on Tesla’s specific arguments, but said "we're fully aware of Tesla's false claims including their shameful attempts to blame the victims for their known defective autopilot system."</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">In the Florida case, Banner's attorneys also filed a motion arguing punitive damages were warranted. The attorneys have deposed several Tesla executives and received internal documents from the company that they said show Musk and engineers were aware of, and did not fix, shortcomings.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-17">In one deposition, former executive <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-tells-regulator-that-full-self-driving-cars-may-not-be-achieved-by-year-2021-05-07/">Christopher Moore</a> testified there are limitations to Autopilot, saying it "is not designed to detect every possible hazard or every possible obstacle or vehicle that could be on the road," according to a transcript reviewed by Reuters.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-18">In 2016, a few months after a fatal accident where a Tesla crashed into a semi-trailer truck, Musk told reporters that the automaker was updating Autopilot with improved radar sensors that likely would have prevented the fatality.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-19">But Adam (Nicklas) Gustafsson, a Tesla Autopilot systems engineer who investigated both accidents in Florida, said that in the almost three years between that 2016 crash and Banner’s accident, no changes were made to Autopilot’s systems to account for cross-traffic, according to court documents submitted by plaintiff lawyers.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-20">The lawyers tried to blame the lack of change on Musk. "Elon Musk has acknowledged problems with the Tesla autopilot system not working properly," according to plaintiffs' documents. Former Autopilot engineer Richard Baverstock, who was also deposed, stated that "almost everything" he did at Tesla was done at the request of "Elon," according to the documents.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-21">Tesla filed an emergency motion in court late on Wednesday seeking to keep deposition transcripts of its employees and other documents secret. Banner’s attorney, Lake "Trey" Lytal III, said he would oppose the motion.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-22">"The great thing about our judicial system is Billion Dollar Corporations can only keep secrets for so long," he wrote in a text message.</p><p data-testid="Body">Reporting by Dan Levine and Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco, Editing by Peter Henderson and Grant McCool</p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

No one was expecting to find that.”</p><p>The surprising discovery prompted a team at the hospital to quickly come together to uncover what kind of roundworm it was and, most importantly, decide on any further treatment the patient might require.</p><p>“We just went for the textbooks, looking up all the different types of roundworm that could cause neurological invasion and disease,” Senanayake said. Their search was fruitless and they looked to outside experts for help.</p><p>“Canberra is a small place, so we sent the worm, which was still alive, straight to the laboratory of a CSIRO scientist who is very experienced with parasites,” Senanayake said. “He just looked at it and said, ‘Oh my goodness, this is <em>Ophidascaris robertsi</em>’.”</p><p><em>Ophidascaris robertsi</em> is a roundworm usually found in pythons. The Canberra hospital patient marks the world-first case of the parasite being found in humans.</p><p>The patient resides near a lake area inhabited by carpet pythons. Despite no direct snake contact, she often collected native grasses, including warrigal greens, from around the lake to use in cooking, Senanayake said.</p><p>The doctors and scientists involved in her case hypothesise that a python may have shed the parasite via its faeces into the grass. They believe the patient was probably infected with the parasite directly from touching the native grass or after eating the greens.</p><p>Senanayake said the patient needed to be treated for other larvae that might have invaded other parts of her body, such as the liver. But given no patient had ever been treated for the parasite before, care was taken. Some medications for example could trigger inflammation as the larvae died off. An inflammation can be harmful to organs such as the brain, so they also needed to administer medications to counteract any dangerous side-effects.</p><figure id="771e23b8-7288-424a-95bb-8aaad0faf990" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47e92ba069a49f6113b7f927dd2a682cafef75d1/1193_1561_2355_1413/master/2355.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47e92ba069a49f6113b7f927dd2a682cafef75d1/1193_1561_2355_1413/master/2355.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47e92ba069a49f6113b7f927dd2a682cafef75d1/1193_1561_2355_1413/master/2355.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47e92ba069a49f6113b7f927dd2a682cafef75d1/1193_1561_2355_1413/master/2355.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47e92ba069a49f6113b7f927dd2a682cafef75d1/1193_1561_2355_1413/master/2355.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47e92ba069a49f6113b7f927dd2a682cafef75d1/1193_1561_2355_1413/master/2355.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A carpet python" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47e92ba069a49f6113b7f927dd2a682cafef75d1/1193_1561_2355_1413/master/2355.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A carpet python – the more conventional host for  <em>Ophidascaris robertsi</em>.</span> Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAP</figcaption></figure><p>“That poor patient, she was so courageous and wonderful,” Senanayake said. “You don’t want to be the first patient in the world with a roundworm found in pythons and we really take our hats off to her.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>My software developer colleagues often ask me where I do get all the time for reading all the tech books or articles, watching conference talks and listening to podcasts. I analyzed my consumption for November and December and here is, what I did (and that’s only the tech related content):</p>
<ul>
<li>Listened to 7 podcast episodes: 5 hours</li>
<li>Listened to 1/2 of an audiobook: 7 hours</li>
<li>Watched 6 videos talks from some conferences: 6 hours</li>
<li>Read 3 books: 12 hours</li>
<li>Read plenty of articles on the internet and offline medium: 30 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, that’s 60 hours for two months (that seems huge) and 30 hours per months (seems reasonable), which means around 7 hours per week (seems doable) and 1 hour per day (that sounds easy!).</p>
<p>That’s <strong>one hour</strong> per day that has to be available for learning!</p>
<p>“Wait a minute! Should I sacrifice one hour of my precious spare time for learning things that I need for work? No way!!!”</p>
<p>You don’t have to (because you need that time for writing blog posts, coding and to prepare conference talks!)! It’s not “free time” aka time where I can do what I want (for parents: care and play with the children 😉 ). It’s the time between working hours, free time and sleeping time. Let’s call it “duty time” (isn’t there a better term for that?). Duty time is the time that we have to spent for going to work, purchase food, cook dinner, going to sleep and so on – all activities we have to do besides your primary work.</p>
<p><strong>The trick is to refine some of the duty time to learning time!<br>
</strong></p>
<p>For example, I’m commuting every day 2×45 minutes to my workplace and back home. I need</p>
<ul>
<li>5 minutes to get to the train station with my bike</li>
<li>10 minutes to wait for the (connecting) trains</li>
<li>25 minutes actually on the trains</li>
<li>5 minutes to get from the train to my working place</li>
</ul>
<p>…and vice versa. That alone makes 90 minutes of duty time per day! Or 80 almost freely available learning time (I don’t like listening to podcasts while I’m riding my bike, which makes 10 minutes that I can’t use per day)!</p>
<p>I also love cooking (but I also have to clean up the kitchen afterward 🙁 ). Let’s say that takes me 40 minutes: 40 minutes duty time = 40 minutes time for watching videos of conference talks.</p>
<p>If I want to, I read in the evening (ok, that’s free time, so it doesn’t count) or listen to an audiobook to calm down or before falling asleep (yes, that’s also duty time!). That gives me easily another 30 minutes per day for free!</p>
<p>So I can easily transform 2.5 hours of duty time per day that I can use for at least 1 hour of learning time. I don’t even have to use half of the available time (that’s good because I’m not good at listening while I cope vegetables with a sharp knife)!</p>
<p>I think it also depends on the right tools for using the duty time efficiently, too. For example, I can’t do any housekeeping fully cabled or with a stationary desktop PC. So I’ve invested some money in optimizing my media consumption:</p>
<ul>
<li>A small tablet (Dell Venue 8 Pro) for watching talks while working in the kitchen and traveling by train (luckily, a few sites allow you to download videos for offline viewing)</li>
<li>A smartphone with plenty of storage (Nexus 5, 32 GB) with a very good podcast app (Podcast Republic)</li>
<li>Two (because one for spare if the other is charging 😉 )Bluetooth headphones (Philips SHB4000) for high quality, interruption free listening. I use them if I’m doing something alone or nobody in my family has to talk with me.</li>
<li>Wired Earphones with a good noise shielding capabilities.</li>
<li>A Bluetooth headset (Plantronics M55) and (since a week) bone conduction headphones (Aftershokz Sportz 3). That’s great if you still want to understand somebody while listening to something.</li>
<li>Some Bluetooth transmitters (CSL Bluetooth transmitter) for connecting non-Bluetooth audio devices to my Bluetooth headphones.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I’m on the move, I mostly use my smartphone and the wired earphones. At home, it depends: If the kids are around while I’m doing work, I use the headset or bone conduction headphones, otherwise the headsets.</p>
<p>I also think it doesn’t matter that you’re 100% concentrated on all the stuff you consume this way. You’ll always get the key facts or main ideas. Really important information will be spared to be consumed in my free time anyway (because it’s worthwhile). For important stuff, I also write down some notes in a notebook that I have almost always on me. These notes will be (hopefully) featured in some upcoming blog posts.</p>
<p>There is plenty of time out there that wants to be spent well!</p>
<p>Update August 2023: I still do it this way and can keep up with the news in IT and more. What I would now also recommend: Practice listening to audio in at least twice the speed as the original! To get used to that, increase the speed every month by +0.1x !</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>When I first told my readers about an Austin-made Tesla Model Y with a cracked front casting, the owner had yet to confirm how serious the problem was. It did not take long: apart from using a flashlight and a mechanic pick to show it affected more than the skinny paint that component has, NK also told me more about his lengthy struggle to correct his brand-new Model Y – which led to a more extensive investigation.</p><div><p>
		The electric <span data-url="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/s.html#ge-sport-utility-vehicle" title="SUV - click for definition">SUV</span> owner told me he still prefers that I use only his initials and his other nickname (Cracked_Tesla) because he wants to give another <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/Tesla%20Service%20Center/">Tesla Service Center</a> a chance to do the right thing. Believe me: NK is spending a lot of energy to get a proper response from the battery electric vehicle (<span data-url="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/b.html#ge-battery-electric-vehicle" title="BEV - click for definition">BEV</span>) maker. The Model Y owner discovered the issue in May, two months after taking delivery of the vehicle. It is his first Tesla.</p><p>

<em>"At delivery, I inspected the car based on the main things other owners said to check. At the time, everything was fine, but I did not check the frame or structural members, as the car was new from the factory, and one shouldn't have to check that."</em></p><div><a id="xaegal_11" href="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/gallery/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting_11.jpg" onclick="return open_lght(11, this)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images-webp/news-gallery-860x/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting-thumbnail_11.jpg.webp"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting-thumbnail_11.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting-thumbnail_11.jpg" width="860" height="484" alt="Tesla Model Y owner wants to discover if other Austin\-made units also have cracked front castings" title="Tesla Model Y owner wants to discover if other Austin\-made units also have cracked front castings" data-gidm="1932617" data-gida="220165" data-gidx="17"></picture></a><p>Photo: NK/Cracked_Tesla</p></div>
<p>
NK denied his car was ever involved in any collisions. Ironically, he discovered the cracked front casting when he was investigating another serious issue that his <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/Tesla%20Model%20Y/">Model Y</a> could present: a missing brake fluid reservoir cap. Believe it or not, for anyone to check if the brake fluid reservoir is in place, they will have to remove the plastic cover on the base of the windscreen. The second embedded video here shows that on a Model 3, which shares several components with the electric SUV.</p><p>

<em>"I saw this post <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/13nbeo8/missing_brake_fluid_cap/">on Reddit</a> and thought it was extremely dangerous if there was no cap to the brake fluid. And based on Tesla's track record of issues, I had to check my car."<br>
</em><br>
An open brake fluid reservoir is a death trap: the vehicle can either lose brake fluid, or this substance may absorb moisture as time goes by, which will make the brakes fail. As much as a Tesla may have regenerative braking, it is not enough to stop the car in emergencies. If it were, the BEV maker would have found a way to eliminate it and save some bucks, rest assured. Cracked_Tesla's car had the cap, but its front casting was cracked, as the images I've published in my first article show.</p><p>

<em>"May is when I first saw the cracks and submitted the service request. I was not able to take the car to the service center until July, so that's when the whole saga began."</em></p><div><a id="xaegal_4" href="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/gallery/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting_4.jpg" onclick="return open_lght(4, this)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images-webp/news-gallery-860x/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting-thumbnail_4.jpg.webp"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting-thumbnail_4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting-thumbnail_4.jpg" width="860" height="484" alt="There's a flashlight behind this cracked front casting, as the light denounces" title="There's a flashlight behind this cracked front casting, as the light denounces" data-gidm="1932610" data-gida="220165" data-gidx="5"></picture></a><p>Photo: NK/Cracked_Tesla</p></div>
<p>
I'd count all four months since the issue was discovered, but NK generously says he has been dealing with the problem with Tesla for the last two. If the company had offered to correct that right from the start, we probably would have never heard of the flaw. Unfortunately, that was not how Tesla decided to deal with NK's concerns.</p><p>

<em>"The manager of the service center said multiple times that 'the car is safe to drive' and that he had been assured by 'engineers' that it is 'safe.' However, he will not give me anything in more detail or any official Tesla documentation to confirm that."</em></p><p>

The <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/Tesla%20Files/">Tesla Files</a> episode revealed that the BEV maker instructs its technicians always to provide feedback orally. Internal documents obtained by Handelsblatt stated: <em>"Do not copy the report below into an email, text message, or leave it in a voicemail to the customer."</em> That was not acceptable for NK, notably after he managed to see and film light beams from his flashlight crossing the cracked front casting. You can check the video below, which Cracked_Tesla published on his YouTube channel and allowed me to embed in this article.</p><div><a id="xaegal_6" href="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/gallery/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting_6.jpg" onclick="return open_lght(6, this)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images-webp/news-gallery-860x/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting-thumbnail_6.jpg.webp"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting-thumbnail_6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting-thumbnail_6.jpg" width="860" height="484" alt="There's a flashlight behind this cracked front casting, as the light denounces" title="There's a flashlight behind this cracked front casting, as the light denounces" data-gidm="1932612" data-gida="220165" data-gidx="7"></picture></a><p>Photo: NK/Cracked_Tesla</p></div>
<p>
Pay careful attention to the area of the crack right below where it bifurcates. The flashlight shines there right at the beginning of the video. I recommend you watch this on your cellphone, where the video format is more favorable. It leaves no doubt about how deep the damage is. The mechanic pick was not even necessary to confirm the issue, but NK used it as well.</p><p>

<em>"I was shocked, scared, and nervous for my safety as it is my only method of transportation."</em></p><p>

So far, Cracked_Tesla has not heard of any other cases like the one involving his <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/BEV/">BEV</a>. Although even the Model Y owner wishes his car to be the only one affected, that is very unlikely. Giga Grünheide faced 60% of rejected cast parts about a year ago. There are pictures of these rejected parts pilling up in Fremont. If NK's Model Y received a component that should also have been discarded by quality control, others may have reached production units as well.</p><p>

NK's alert should get Austin-made BEV owners to verify that. If you repair <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/Tesla/">Tesla</a> vehicles and have ever seen anything like this, please let NK and me know. If the BEV maker is so sure that this is not serious, it should provide Cracked_Tesla at least with a document that gives him some peace of mind. I'll let you know about all the developments this story may have. <i></i></p><iframe width="480" height="857" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Aspt2QM7waM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J03NDWdm2Xg" data-embed="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J03NDWdm2Xg?wmode=transparent" target="_blank" title="Click to play video"><img alt="Video thumbnail" data-gidx="-1" width="480" height="360" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi_webp/J03NDWdm2Xg/hqdefault.webp"><span><i></i></span></a></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.thecodedmessage.com/posts/c++-papercuts/">https://www.thecodedmessage.com/posts/c++-papercuts/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37292295">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>My current day job is now again a C++ role. And so, I find myself again
focusing in this blog post on the downsides of C++.</p>
<p>Overall, I have found returning to active C++ dev to be exactly what
I expected: I still have the skills, and can still be effective in it,
but now that I have worked in a more modern programming language with
less legacy cruft, the downsides of C++ sting more. There are so many
features I miss from Rust, not only the obvious safety features, or even
primarily those, but also features that C++ could easily add, like sum
types (called <code>enum</code>s in Rust), or first-class support for tuples.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I will focus on the minor problems of C++ that
have affected me the most, the little usability <em>papercuts</em>, the petty
inconveniences that just waste time. Instead of focusing on comparing
them to Rust or other programming languages, I will focus on why they
don’t make sense from a C++ point of view, with reference to just C++.
I know better than to hope that by doing this that die-hard C++ fans will
accept my criticism, but perhaps it will be relatable to C++ programmers
who don’t have Rust experience.</p>
<p>Before I start getting into the papercuts, though, I want to address
one of the primary defenses I’ve seen of C++, one that I’ve found
particularly baffling. It goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C++ is a great programming language. The complaints are just from
people who aren’t up to it. If they were better programmers,
they’d appreciate the C++ way of doing things, and they wouldn’t
need their hand-held. Languages like Rust are not helpful for
such true professionals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, the phrasing is a bit of a parody, but I’ve seen this
sort of attitude so many times. The most charitable view I can take
of it is a claim that C++’s difficulty is a sign of its power, and
the natural cost of using a powerful programming language. What it
reads like to me in many cases, however, is as a form of elitism:
a general idea that making things easy for poorer programmers is
pointless, and that good programmers don’t benefit from making
things easier.</p>
<p>As someone who has programmed C++ professionally for a majority of my
career, and who has taught (company-internal) classes in advanced C++,
this is nonsense to me. I do know how to navigate the many papercuts
and foot-guns of C++, and am happy to do so when working on a C++
codebase. But experienced as I am, they still slow me down and
distract me, taking focus away from the actual problems I’m trying
to solve, and resulting in less maintainable code.</p>
<p>And as for the upside, I see very little – any way in which C++ is
more performant or more appropriate than Rust is in terms of platform
support, legacy codebases, optimizations that are only available in
specific compilers that happen to not support Rust, or other concerns
irrelevant to the actual design of the programming language.</p>
<p>While I am proud of my C++ skills, I am not too proud to appreciate
that better technology can render them partially obsolete. I am not
too proud to appreciate having features that make it easier. In most
cases, it’s not a matter of the programming language doing more work
for me, but of C++ creating unnecessary extra make-work, often
due to decisions that made sense when they were made, but have long
since stopped making sense – don’t get me started on header files!</p>
<p>But I also want my programming language to be beginner-friendly. I am
always going to work with other programmers with a variety of skill-sets,
and I would rather not have to clean up my colleagues' mistakes –
or mistakes of earlier, more foolish versions of myself. If making a
programming language more beginner-friendly sacrifices power, then I
agree that some programming languages should not do it. But many, even
most of C++’s beginner-unfriendly (and expert-annoying) features do not
in fact make the language more powerful.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, here are the biggest papercuts I’ve noticed
in the past month of returning to C++ development.</p>
<h2 id="const-is-not-the-default"><code>const</code> is not the default<a href="#const-is-not-the-default" arialabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>It is very easy to forget to mark a parameter <code>const</code> when it can be.
You can just forget to type the keyword. This is especially true for
<code>this</code>, which is an implicit parameter: there is no time when you are
typing out the <code>this</code> parameter explicitly, and therefore it won’t sit
there looking funny without the appropriate modifiers.</p>
<p>If C++ had the opposite default, where every value, reference, and pointer
was <code>const</code> unless explicitly declared mutable, then we’d be much more
likely to have every parameter declared correctly based on whether the
function needs to mutate it or not. If someone includes a <code>mutable</code> keyword,
it would be because they know they need it. If they need it and forget it,
the compiler error would remind them.</p>
<p>Now, you might not think this is important, because you can just not
use <code>const</code> and have functions with capabilities they don’t need –
but sometimes you have to take things by <code>const</code> in C++. If you take a
parameter by non-<code>const</code> reference, the caller can only use lvalues to
call your function. But if you take a parameter by <code>const</code> reference,
the caller can use lvalues or rvalues.  So some functions, in order to
be used in natural ways, must take their parameters by <code>const</code> reference.</p>
<p>Once you have a <code>const</code> reference, you can only (easily) call functions
with it that accept <code>const</code> references, and so if any of those functions
forgot to declare the parameter <code>const</code>, you have to include a <code>const_cast</code>
– or go change the function later to correctly accept <code>const</code>.</p>
<p>Lest you think this is just a sloppy newbie error, note that
many functions in the standard library had to be updated to take
<code>const_iterator</code> instead of or in addition to <code>iterator</code> when it was
discovered correctly that they made sense with a <code>const_iterator</code>:
functions like <code>erase</code>. It turns out that for functions like <code>erase</code>,
the collection is what has to be mutable, not the iterator – a fact
that the maintainers of the C++ library simply got wrong at first.</p>
<h2 id="obligatory-copying">Obligatory Copying<a href="#obligatory-copying" arialabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>In C++, for an object to be copyable is the default, privileged way
for an object to behave. If you don’t want your object to be copyable,
and all its fields are copyable, you often have to mark the copy constructor
and copy assignment operator as <code>= delete</code>. The default is for the compiler
to write code for you – code that can be incorrect.</p>
<p>If you do make your class move-only, however, beware, because
that means that there are situations where you can’t use
it. In C++11, there is no ergonomic way to do a lambda capture
by move – which is usually how I want to capture variables
into a closure.</p>
<p>Similarly, <code>std::function</code> expects the object it manages
to be copyable, and will fail to compile if your closure
object is move-only. This is going to be addressed in C++23, with
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/move_only_function/move_only_function"><code>std::move_only_function</code></a>
– but in the meantime, I have been forced to write classes with a copy
constructor that throws some sort of run-time logic exception.
And even in C++23, copyable functions will be the default, assumed
situation.</p>
<p>This is strange, because most complicated objects, especially closures,
are never, and should never be, copied. Generally, copying a complicated
data structure is a mistake – a missing <code>&amp;</code>, or a missing <code>std::move</code>.
But it is a mistake that carries no warning with it, and no visible
sign in the code that a complex, allocation-heavy action is being
undertaken. This is an early lesson to new C++ devs – don’t pass
non-primitive types by value – but it’s possible for even advanced devs
to mess up from time to time, and once it’s in the codebase, it’s easy
to miss.</p>
<h2 id="by-reference-parameter-papercuts">By-Reference Parameter Papercuts<a href="#by-reference-parameter-papercuts" arialabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>It is unergonomic to return multiple values by tuple in C++. It can be
done, but the calls to <code>std::tie</code> and <code>std::make_tuple</code> are long-winded
and distracting, not to mention that you’ll be writing unidiomatically,
which is always bad for people who are reading and debugging your code. As
a result, C++ often resorts to out parameters. In this as well as other
situations, you end up taking a parameter by non-<code>const</code> reference,
meaning the function is supposed to modify the parameter.</p>
<p>The problem is, this is only marked in the function signature. If you
have a function that takes a parameter by reference, the parameter looks
the same as a by-value parameter at the call site:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>// Return false on failure. Modify size with actual message size,
// decreasing it if it contains more than one message.
bool got_message(const char *void mesg, size_t &amp;size);

size_t size = buff.size();
got_message(buff.data(), size);
buff.resize(size);
</code></pre><p>If you’re reading the calling code quickly, it might look like the
<code>resize</code> call is redundant, but it is not. <code>size</code> is being modified by
<code>got_message</code>, and the only way to know that it is being modified is to
look at the function signature, which is usually in another file.</p>
<p>Some people prefer out parameters and in-out parameters to be passed
by pointer for this very reason:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>bool got_message(const char *void mesg, size_t *size);

size_t size = buff.size();
got_message(buff.data(), &amp;size);
buff.resize(size);
</code></pre><p>This is great – or would be, if pointers weren’t nullable. What does
a <code>nullptr</code> parameter mean in this context? Is it going to trigger
undefined behavior? What if you pass a pointer from a caller into it?
People often forget to document what functions do with a null pointer.</p>
<p>This can be addressed with a non-nullable smart pointer, but very
few programmers actually do this in practice. When something isn’t
the default, it tends to not be used everywhere where appropriate.
The sustainable answer to this is changing the default, not heroic
attempts to fight human nature.</p>
<p>Obligatory side-gripe:
At least in non-owning situations like this, it is possible to write
such a smart pointer. However, if you want to write the obvious companion,
a non-nullable owning smart pointer, a companion version of <code>std::unique_ptr</code>,
then it cannot be done in a useful way, because such a pointer cannot
then <a href="https://www.thecodedmessage.com/posts/cpp-move/">be moveable</a>.</p>
<h2 id="method-implementations-can-contradict">Method Implementations Can Contradict<a href="#method-implementations-can-contradict" arialabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>In C++, every time you write a class, especially a lower-level one,
you have a responsibility to make decisions about certain methods with
special semantic importance in the programming language:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Constructor (Copy):</strong> <code>X(const X&amp;)</code></li>
<li><strong>Constructor (Move):</strong> <code>X(X&amp;&amp;)</code></li>
<li><strong>Assignment (Copy):</strong> <code>operator=(const X&amp;)</code></li>
<li><strong>Assignment (Move):</strong> <code>operator=(X&amp;&amp;)</code></li>
<li><strong>Destructor:</strong> <code>~X()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For many classes, the default implementations are enough, and if
possible you should rely on them. Whether or not this is possible
depends on whether naively copying all of the fields is a sensible
way to copy the entire object, which is surprisingly easy to forget
to consider.</p>
<p>But if you need a custom implementation of one of these, you are on
the hook to write all of them. This is known as the “rule of 5.”
You have to write all of them, even though the correct behavior of the
two assignment operators can be completely determined by the
appropriate constructor combined with the destructor. The compiler could
make default implementations of the assignment operators that refer to
those other functions, and therefore would always be correct, but it
does not. Implementing them correctly is tricky, requiring techniques
like either explicitly protecting against self-assignment, or swapping
with a by-value parameter. In any case, they are boilerplate, and yet
another thing that can go wrong in a programming language that has many
such things.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" arialabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I am all too well aware of why these decisions were
made, and it is exactly one reason: Compatibility with legacy code.
C++ has no editions system, no way to deprecate core language
features.  If a new edition of C++ was made, it would <a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang">cease to be
C++</a> – though I
support the efforts of people to transition C++ to new syntax
and clean some of this stuff up.</p>
<p>However, if you ignore backwards-compatibility and the large existing
codebases, none of these papercuts make the programming language more
powerful or better, just harder to use. I’ve seen good-faith arguments
in favor of human-maintained header files, surprising as that is to me, but I
challenge my readers to tell me what is beneficial about C++’s design
choices in these matters.</p>
<p>You might find these things trivial, but these all slow programmers
down, while simultaneously annoying them. If you are experienced enough,
your subconscious might be adept at navigating it, but imagine what your
subconscious could do if it didn’t have to. But how adept are you at seeing
these mistakes in a code review from your junior colleagues? If you are a
rigorous reviewer, how much more time does it take? How adept are you at
finding these issues quickly when a bug arises?</p>
<p>We’d be more effective, more efficient, and happier if these issues were
resolved. Programming would be both enjoyable and faster to do.
What’s the downside? The only upside is continuity with history.
And while I can see the value in that, it is a very limited value,
with very limited scope.</p>

<p><em>Special thanks to Dennis Pourteaux and Jay Baxter for feedback and review.</em></p>
<p>The last two years of <s>Twitter</s> X have been tumultuous, to say the least. After the platform was <s><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-twitter-set-accept-musks-best-final-offer-sources-2022-04-25/">bought</a></s> <s><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/06/technology/elon-musk-twitter.html">not bought</a></s> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/elon-musk-twitter-deal-complete.html">bought</a> by Elon Musk for $44 billion last year, Elon enacted sweeping changes to the company's <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/11/04/twitter-temporarily-closes-offices-as-elon-musk-begins-mass-layoffs">staffing</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/29/1139822833/twitter-covid-misinformation-policy-not-enforced">content moderation</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/12/1139619598/twitter-blue-relaunch">business model</a>, not to mention changes to the culture on the site that may well have been a result of Elon's soft power more than any specific policy decision. But in the middle of these highly contentious actions, one new feature on Twitter grew rapidly in importance, and seems to be beloved by people across the political spectrum: Community Notes.</p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1597170780130852864">

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/elonnote.png"></p>
</center>
</a>
<p>Community Notes is a fact-checking tool that sometimes attaches context notes, like the one on Elon's tweet above, to tweets as a fact-checking and anti-misinformation tool. It was originally called Birdwatch, and was first rolled out as a pilot project in January 2021. Since then, it has expanded in stages, with the most rapid phase of its expansion coinciding with Twitter's takeover by Elon last year. Today, Community Notes appear frequently on tweets that get a very large audience on Twitter, including those on contentious political topics. And both in my view, and in the view of many people across the political spectrum I talk to, the notes, when they appear, are informative and valuable.</p>
<p>But what interests me most about Community Notes is how, despite not being a "crypto project", it might be the closest thing to an instantiation of "crypto values" that we have seen in the mainstream world. Community Notes are not written or curated by some centrally selected set of experts; rather, they can be written and voted on by anyone, and which notes are shown or not shown is decided entirely by an <a href="https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes">open source</a> algorithm. The Twitter site has a <a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/about/introduction">detailed and extensive guide</a> describing how the algorithm works, and you can <a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/download-data">download the data</a> containing which notes and votes have been published, run <a href="https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes/tree/main/sourcecode">the algorithm</a> locally, and verify that the output matches what is visible on the Twitter site. It's not perfect, but it's surprisingly close to satisfying the ideal of <a href="https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/">credible neutrality</a>, all while being impressively useful, even under contentious conditions, at the same time.</p>

<p>Anyone with a Twitter account <a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/contributing/signing-up">matching some criteria</a> (basically: active for 6+ months, no recent rule violations, verified phone number) can sign up to participate in Community Notes. Currently, participants are slowly and randomly being accepted, but eventually the plan is to let in anyone who fits the criteria. Once you are accepted, you can at first participate in rating existing notes, and once you've made enough good ratings (<a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/contributor-scores">measured by</a> seeing which ratings match with the final outcome for that note), you can also write notes of your own.</p>
<p>When you write a note, the note gets a score based on the reviews that it receives from other Community Notes members. These reviews can be thought of as being votes along a 3-point scale of <code>HELPFUL</code>, <code>SOMEWHAT_HELPFUL</code> and <code>NOT_HELPFUL</code>, but a review can also contain some other tags that have roles in the algorithm. Based on these reviews, a note gets a score. If the note's score is above 0.40, the note is shown; otherwise, the note is not shown.</p>
<p>The way that the score is calculated is what makes the algorithm unique. Unlike simpler algorithms, which aim to simply calculate some kind of sum or average over users' ratings and use that as the final result, <strong>the Community Notes rating algorithm explicitly attempts to prioritize notes that receive positive ratings from people across a diverse range of perspectives</strong>. That is, if people who usually disagree on how they rate notes end up agreeing on a particular note, that note is scored especially highly.</p>
<p>Let us get into the deep math of how this works. We have a set of users and a set of notes; we can create a matrix <span>\(M\)</span>, where the cell <span>\(M_{i,j}\)</span> represents how the i'th user rated the j'th note.</p>
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/matrix.png"></p>
</center>

<p>For any given note, most users have not rated that note, so most entries in the matrix will be zero, but that's fine. The goal of the algorithm is to create a four-column model of users and notes, assigning each user two stats that we can call "friendliness" and "polarity", and each note two stats that we can call "helpfulness" and "polarity". The model is trying to predict the matrix as a function of these values, using the following formula:</p>
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/formula.png"></p>
</center>

<p>Note that here I am introducing both the terminology used in the <a href="https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes/blob/main/birdwatch_paper_2022_10_27.pdf">Birdwatch paper</a>, and my own terms to provide a less mathematical intuition for what the variables mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>μ is a "<strong>general public mood</strong>" parameter that accounts for how high the ratings are that users give in general</li>
<li><span>\(i_u\)</span> is a user's "<strong>friendliness</strong>": how likely that particular user is to give high ratings</li>
<li><span>\(i_n\)</span> is a note's "<strong>helpfulness</strong>": how likely that particular note is to get rated highly. <strong>Ultimately, this is the variable we care about</strong>.</li>
<li><span>\(f_u\)</span> or <span>\(f_n\)</span> is user or note's "<strong>polarity</strong>": its position among the dominant axis of political polarization. In practice, negative polarity roughly means "left-leaning" and positive polarity means "right-leaning", but note that <strong>the axis of polarization is discovered emergently from analyzing users and notes; the concepts of leftism and rightism are in no way hard-coded</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The algorithm uses a pretty basic machine learning model (standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">gradient descent</a>) to find values for these variables that do the best possible job of predicting the matrix values. The helpfulness that a particular note is assigned is the note's final score. If a note's helpfulness is at least +0.4, the note gets shown.</p>
<p><strong>The core clever idea here is that the "polarity" terms absorb the properties of a note that cause it to be liked by some users and not others, and the "helpfulness" term only measures the properties that a note has that cause it to be liked by all</strong>. Thus, selecting for helpfulness identifies notes that get cross-tribal approval, and selects against notes that get cheering from one tribe at the expense of disgust from the other tribe.</p>
<p>I made a simplified implementation of the basic algorithm; you can find it <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/community_notes_analysis/basic_algo.py">here</a>, and are welcome to play around with it.</p>
<p>Now, the above is only a description of the central core of the algorithm. In reality, there are a <em>lot</em> of extra mechanisms bolted on top. Fortunately, they are described in the <a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/ranking-notes">public documentation</a>. These mechanisms include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The algorithm gets run many times, each time adding some randomly generated extreme "pseudo-votes" to the votes. This means that the algorithm's true output for each note is a range of values, and the final result depends on a "lower confidence bound" taken from this range, which is checked against a threshold of 0.32.</li>
<li>If many users (especially users with a similar polarity to the note) rate a note "Not Helpful", and furthermore they specify the same "<a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/ranking-notes">tag</a>" (eg. "Argumentative or biased language", "Sources do not support note") as the reason for their rating, the helpfulness threshold required for the note to be published increases from 0.4 to 0.5 (this looks small but it's very significant in practice)</li>
<li>If a note is accepted, the threshold that its helpfulness must drop below to de-accept it is 0.01 points lower than the threshold that a note's helpfulness needed to reach for the note to be originally accepted</li>
<li>The algorithm gets run <em>even more times</em> with multiple models, and this can sometimes promote notes whose original helpfulness score is somewhere between 0.3 and 0.4</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, you get some pretty complicated python code that amounts to 6282 lines stretching across 22 files. But it is all <a href="https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes">open</a>, you can download the <a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/ranking-notes">note and rating data</a> and run it yourself, and see if the outputs correspond to what is actually on Twitter at any given moment.</p>
<h2 id="so-how-does-this-look-in-practice">So how does this look in practice?</h2>
<p>Probably the single most important idea in this algorithm that distinguishes it from naively taking an average score from people's votes is what I call the "polarity" values. The algorithm documentation calls them <span>\(f_u\)</span> and <span>\(f_n\)</span>, using <span>\(f\)</span> for <em>factor</em> because these are the two terms that get multiplied with each other; the more general language is in part because of a desire to eventually make <span>\(f_u\)</span> and <span>\(f_n\)</span> multi-dimensional.</p>
<p>Polarity is assigned to both users and notes. The link between <em>user</em> IDs and the underlying Twitter accounts is intentionally kept hidden, but notes are public. In practice, the polarities generated by the algorithm, at least for the English-language data set, map very closely to the left vs right political spectrum.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of notes that have gotten polarities around -0.8:</p>

<p>Once again, it is worth reminding ourselves that the "left vs right divide" was <em>not</em> in any way hardcoded into the algorithm; it was discovered emergently by the calculation. This suggests that if you apply this algorithm in other cultural contexts, it could automatically detect what their primary political divides are, and bridge across those too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, notes that get the highest <em>helpfulness</em> look like this. This time, because these notes are actually shown on Twitter, I can just screenshot one directly:</p>
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/helpfulnote1.png"></p>
</center>

<p>And another one:</p>
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/helpfulnote2.png"></p>
</center>

<p>The second one touches on highly partisan political themes more directly, but it's a clear, high-quality and informative note, and so it gets rated highly. So all in all, the algorithm seems to work, and the ability to verify the outputs of the algorithm by running the code seems to work.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-think-of-the-algorithm">What do I think of the algorithm?</h2>
<p>The main thing that struck me when analyzing the algorithm is just how <em>complex</em> it is. There is the "academic paper version", a gradient descent which finds a best fit to a five-term vector and matrix equation, and then the real version, a complicated series of many different executions of the algorithm with lots of arbitrary coefficients along the way.</p>
<p>Even the academic paper version hides complexity under the hood. The equation that it's optimizing is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial">degree</a>-4 equation (as there's a degree-2 <span>\(f_u * f_n\)</span> term in the prediction formula, and compounding that the cost function <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares">measures error squared</a>). While optimizing a degree-2 equation over any number of variables almost always has a unique solution, which you can calculate with fairly basic linear algebra, a degree-4 equation over many variables often has many solutions, and so multiple rounds of a gradient descent algorithm may well arrive at different answers. Tiny changes to the input may well cause the descent to flip from one local minimum to another, significantly changing the output.</p>
<p>The distinction between this, and algorithms that I helped work on such as <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html">quadratic funding</a>, feels to me like a distinction between an <strong>economist's algorithm</strong> and an <strong>engineer's algorithm</strong>. An economist's algorithm, at its best, values being simple, being reasonably easy to analyze, and having clear mathematical properties that show why it's optimal (or least-bad) for the task that it's trying to solve, and ideally proves bounds on how much damage someone can do by trying to exploit it. An engineer's algorithm, on the other hand, is a result of iterative trial and error, seeing what works and what doesn't in the engineer's operational context. Engineer's algorithms <em>are pragmatic and do the job</em>; economist's algorithms <em>don't go totally crazy when confronted with the unexpected</em>.</p>
<p>Or, as was <a href="https://twitter.com/tszzl/status/1473156331297120256">famously said</a> on a related topic by the esteemed internet philosopher roon (aka tszzl):</p>
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/roontweet.png"></p>
</center>

<p>Of course, I would say that the "theorycel aesthetic" side of crypto is necessary precisely to distinguish protocols that are <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html">actually trustless</a> from janky constructions that look fine and seem to work well but under the hood require trusting a few centralized actors - or worse, actually end up being <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/05/25/stable.html">outright scams</a>.</p>
<p>Deep learning works when it works, but it has inevitable vulnerabilities to all kinds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning">adversarial machine learning</a> attacks. Nerd traps and sky-high abstraction ladders, if done well, can be quite robust against them. And so one question I have is: <strong>could we turn Community Notes itself into something that's more like an economist algorithm</strong>?</p>
<p>To give a view of what this would mean in practice, let's explore an algorithm I came up with a few years ago for a similar purpose: <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/pairwise-coordination-subsidies-a-new-quadratic-funding-design/5553">pairwise-bounded quadratic funding</a>.</p>
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/pairwiseqf.png"></p>
</center>

<p>The goal of pairwise-bounded quadratic funding is to plug a hole in "regular" quadratic funding, where if even two participants collude with each other, they can each contribute a very high amount of money to a fake project that sends the money back to them, and get a large subsidy that drains the entire pool. In pairwise quadratic funding, we assign each pair of participants a limited budget <span>\(M\)</span>. The algorithm walks over all possible pairs of participants, and if the algorithm decides to add a subsidy to some project <span>\(P\)</span> because both participant <span>\(A\)</span> and participant <span>\(B\)</span> supported it, that subsidy comes out of the budget assigned to the pair <span>\((A, B)\)</span>. Hence, even if <span>\(k\)</span> participants were to collude, the amount they could steal from the mechanism is at most <span>\(k * (k-1) * M\)</span>.</p>
<p>An algorithm of <em>exactly</em> this form is not very applicable to the Community Notes context, because each user makes very few votes: on average, any two users would have exactly zero votes in common, and so the algorithm would learn nothing about users' polarities by just looking at each pair of users separately. The goal of the machine learning model is precisely to try to "fill in" the matrix from very sparse source data that cannot be analyzed in this way directly. But the challenge of this approach is that it takes extra effort to do it in a way that does not make the result highly volatile in the face of a few bad votes.</p>

<p>One thing that we could do is analyze whether or not the Community Notes algorithm, as is, actually manages to fight polarization <em>at all</em> - that is, whether or not it actually does any better than a naive voting algorithm. Naive voting algorithms already fight polarization to some limited extent: a post with 200 upvotes and 100 downvotes does worse than a post that just gets the 200 upvotes. But does Community Notes do better than <em>that</em>?</p>
<p>Looking at the algorithm abstractly, it's hard to tell. Why wouldn't a high-average-rating but polarizing post get a strong polarity <em>and</em> a high helpfulness? The idea is that polarity is supposed to "absorb" the properties of a note that cause it to get a lot of votes if those votes are conflicting, but does it actually do that?</p>
<p>To check this, I ran <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/community_notes_analysis/basic_algo.py">my own simplified implementation</a> for 100 rounds. The average results were:</p>
<pre><code>Quality averages:
Group 1 (good): 0.30032841807271166
Group 2 (good but extra polarizing): 0.21698871680927437
Group 3 (neutral): 0.09443120045416832
Group 4 (bad): -0.1521160965793673</code></pre>
<p>In this test, "Good" notes received a rating of +2 from users in the same political tribe and +0 from users in the opposite political tribe, and "Good but extra polarizing" notes received a rating of +4 from same-tribe users and -2 from opposite-tribe users. Same average, but different polarity. And it seems to actually be the case that "Good" notes get a higher average helpfulness than "Good but extra polarizing" notes.</p>
<p>One other benefit of having something closer to an "economist's algorithm" would be having a clearer story for how the algorithm is penalizing polarization.</p>
<h2 id="how-useful-is-this-all-in-high-stakes-situations">How useful is this all in high-stakes situations?</h2>
<p>We can see some of how this works out by looking at one specific situation. About a month ago, Ian Bremmer complained that a highly critical Community Note that was added to a tweet by a Chinese government official <a href="https://twitter.com/ianbremmer/status/1676590373727088647">had been removed</a>.</p>
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/chinanote.png"></p>
<p><em>The note, which is now no longer visible. Screenshot by <a href="https://twitter.com/ianbremmer">Ian Bremmer</a>.</em></p>
</center>

<p>This is heavy stuff. It's one thing to do mechanism design in a nice sandbox Ethereum community environment where the largest complaint is $20,000 <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/01/28/round4.html">going to a polarizing Twitter influencer</a>. It's another to do it for political and geopolitical questions that affect many millions of people and where everyone, often quite understandably, is assuming maximum bad faith. But if mechanism designers want to have a significant impact into the world, engaging with these high-stakes environments is ultimately necessary.</p>
<p>In the case of Twitter, there is a clear reason why one might suspect centralized manipulation to be behind the Note's removal: Elon has a lot of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musks-business-ties-china-draw-scrutiny-twitter-purchase-rcna26057">business interests in China</a>, and so there is a possibility that Elon forced the Community Notes team to interfere with the algorithm's outputs and delete this specific one.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the algorithm is open source and verifiable, so we can actually look under the hood! Let's do that. The URL of the original tweet is <a href="https://twitter.com/MFA_China/status/1676157337109946369"><code>https://twitter.com/MFA_China/status/1676157337109946369</code></a>. The number at the end, <code>1676157337109946369</code>, is the tweet ID. We can search for that in the <a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/ranking-notes">downloadable data</a>, and identify the specific row in the spreadsheet that has the above note:</p>
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/commandline1.png"></p>
</center>

<p>Here we get the ID of the note itself, <code>1676391378815709184</code>. We then search for <em>that</em> in the <code>scored_notes.tsv</code> and <code>note_status_history.tsv</code> files generated by running the algorithm. We get:</p>
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/commandline2.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/commandline3.png"></p>
</center>

<p>The second column in the first output is the note's current rating. The second output shows the note's history: its current status is in the seventh column (<code>NEEDS_MORE_RATINGS</code>), and the first status that's not <code>NEEDS_MORE_RATINGS</code> that it received earlier on is in the fifth column (<code>CURRENTLY_RATED_HELPFUL</code>). Hence, we see that <strong>the algorithm itself first showed the note, and then removed it once its rating dropped somewhat - seemingly no centralized intervention involved</strong>.</p>
<p>We can see this another way by looking at the votes themselves. We can scan the <code>ratings-00000.tsv</code> file to isolate all the ratings for this note, and see how many rated <code>HELPFUL</code> vs <code>NOT_HELPFUL</code>:</p>
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/commandline4.png"></p>
</center>

<p>But if you sort them by timestamp, and look at the first 50 votes, you see 40 <code>HELPFUL</code> votes and 9 <code>NOT_HELPFUL</code> votes. And so we see the same conclusion: the note's initial audience viewed the note more favorably then the note's later audience, and so its rating started out higher and dropped lower over time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the exact story of <em>how</em> the note changed status is complicated to explain: it's not a simple matter of "before the rating was above 0.40, now it's below 0.40, so it got dropped". Rather, the high volume of <code>NOT_HELPFUL</code> replies triggered one of the <a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/ranking-notes#tag-outlier-filtering">outlier conditions</a>, increasing the helpfulness score that the note needs to stay over the threshold.</p>
<p>This is a good learning opportunity for another lesson: making a credibly neutral algorithm truly <em>credible</em> requires <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/11/25/central_planning.html">keeping it simple</a>. If a note moves from being accepted to not being accepted, there should be a simple and legible story as to why.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, there is a totally different way in which this vote could have been manipulated: brigading</strong>. Someone who sees a note that they disapprove of could call upon a highly engaged community (or worse, a mass of fake accounts) to rate it <code>NOT_HELPFUL</code>, and it may not require that many votes to drop the note from being seen as "helpful" to being seen as "polarized". Properly minimizing the vulnerability of this algorithm to such coordinated attacks will require a lot more analysis and work. One possible improvement would be not allowing any user to vote on any note, but instead using the "For you" algorithmic feed to randomly allocate notes to raters, and only allow raters to rate those notes that they have been allocated to.</p>

<p>The main criticism of Community Notes that I have seen is basically that it does not do enough. <a href="https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/why-twitters-community-notes-feature-mostly-fails-to-combat-misinformation/">Two</a> recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-twitter-birdwatch-community-notes-misinformation-politics/#xj4y7vzkg">articles</a> that I have seen make this point. Quoting one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The program is severely hampered by the fact that for a Community Note to be public, it has to be generally accepted by a consensus of people from all across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>"It has to have ideological consensus," he said. "That means people on the left and people on the right have to agree that that note must be appended to that tweet."</p>
<p>Essentially, it requires a "cross-ideological agreement on truth, and in an increasingly partisan environment, achieving that consensus is almost impossible, he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a difficult issue, but ultimately I come down on the side that it is better to let ten misinformative tweets go free than it is to have one tweet covered by a note that judges it unfairly. We have seen years of fact-checking that <em>is</em> brave, and <em>does</em> come from the perspective of "well, actually we know the truth, and we know that one side lies much more often than the other". And what happened as a result?</p>

<center>

</center>

<p>Honestly, some pretty widespread distrust of fact-checking as a concept. One strategy here is to say: ignore the haters, remember that the fact checking experts really do know the facts better than any voting system, and stay the course. But going all-in on this approach <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/">seems risky</a>. There is value in building cross-tribal institutions that are at least somewhat respected by everyone. As with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone%27s_ratio">William Blackstone's dictum</a> and the courts, it feels to me that maintaining such respect requires a system that commits far more sins of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_of_omission">omission</a> than it does sins of commission. And so it seems valuable to me that there is at least one major organization that is taking this alternate path, and treating its rare cross-tribal respect as a resource to be cherished and built upon.</p>
<p>Another reason why I think it is okay for Community Notes to be conservative is that I do not think it is the goal for every misinformative tweet, or even most misinformative tweets, to receive a corrective note. <strong>Even if less than one percent of misinformative tweets get a note providing context or correcting them, Community Notes is still providing an exceedingly valuable service as an educational tool.</strong> The goal is not to correct everything; rather, the goal is to remind people that multiple perspectives exist, that certain kinds of posts that look convincing and engaging in isolation are actually quite incorrect, and you, yes you, can often go do a basic internet search to verify that it's incorrect.</p>
<p>Community Notes cannot be, and is not meant to be, a miracle cure that solves all problems in public epistemology. Whatever problems it does not solve, there is plenty of room for other mechanisms, whether newfangled gadgets such as <a href="https://manifold.markets/">prediction</a> <a href="https://manifold.markets/">markets</a> or good old-fashioned organizations hiring full-time staff with domain expertise, to try to fill in the gaps.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Community Notes, in addition to being a fascinating social media experiment, is also an instance of a fascinating new and emerging genre of mechanism design: mechanisms that intentionally try to identify polarization, and favor things that bridge across divides rather than perpetuate them.</p>
<p>The two other things in this category that I know about are (i) <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/pairwise-coordination-subsidies-a-new-quadratic-funding-design/5553">pairwise quadratic funding</a>, which is being used in <a href="https://grants.gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin Grants</a> and (ii) <a href="https://pol.is/">Polis</a>, a discussion tool that uses clustering algorithms to help communities identify statements that are commonly well-received across people who normally have different viewpoints. This area of mechanism design is valuable, and I hope that we can see a lot more academic work in this field.</p>
<p>Algorithmic transparency of the type that Community Notes offers is not quite full-on decentralized social media - if you disagree with how Community Notes works, there's no way to go see a view of the same content with a different algorithm. But it's the closest that very-large-scale applications are going to get within the next couple of years, and we can see that it provides a lot of value already, both by preventing centralized manipulation and by ensuring that platforms that do not engage in such manipulation can get proper credit for doing so.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing both Community Notes, and hopefully many more algorithms of a similar spirit, develop and grow over the next decade.</p>

<p>Fortran <br> High-performance parallel programming language</p>

<p>Features</p>
<p>High performance</p>
<p>Fortran has been designed from the ground up for computationally intensive applications in science and engineering. Mature and battle-tested compilers and libraries allow you to write code that runs close to the metal, fast.</p>
<p>Statically and strongly typed</p>
<p>Fortran is statically and strongly typed, which allows the compiler to catch many programming errors early on for you. This also allows the compiler to generate efficient binary code.</p>
<p>Easy to learn and use</p>
<p>Fortran is a relatively small language that is surprisingly easy to learn and use. Expressing most mathematical and arithmetic operations over large arrays is as simple as writing them as equations on a whiteboard.</p>
<p>Versatile</p>
<p>Fortran allows you to write code in a style that best fits your problem: imperative, procedural, array-oriented, object-oriented, or functional.</p>
<p>Natively parallel</p>
<p>Fortran is a natively parallel programming language with intuitive array-like syntax to communicate data between CPUs. You can run almost the same code on a single CPU, on a shared-memory multicore system, or on a distributed-memory HPC or cloud-based system. Coarrays, teams, events, and collective subroutines allow you to express different parallel programming patterns that best fit your problem at hand.</p>
<p>FAQ</p>
<p>What is the status of Fortran?</p>
<p>Fortran is mature and under active development.
The latest revision of the language is
<a href="https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&amp;amp;objId=19441669&amp;amp;objAction=Open">Fortran 2018</a>.
The next revision,
<a href="https://wg5-fortran.org/N2151-N2200/N2194.pdf">Fortran 2023</a>, is planned for
release in 2023.
There are over a dozen open source and proprietary
<a href="https://fortran-lang.org/en/compilers/"><span>Fortran compilers</span></a>.
Further, open source projects like the
<a href="https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib">Standard Library</a>
and the <a href="https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/">Fortran Package Manager</a> are
under active development.</p>
<p>What is Fortran used for?</p>
<p>Fortran is mostly used in domains that adopted computation early–science and engineering. These include numerical weather and ocean prediction, computational fluid dynamics, applied math, statistics, and finance. Fortran is the dominant language of High Performance Computing and is used to <a href="https://top500.org/">benchmark the fastest supercomputers in the world</a>.</p>
<p>Should I use Fortran for my new project?</p>
<p>If you’re writing a program or a library to perform fast arithmetic computation over large numeric arrays, Fortran is the optimal tool for the job.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><nav aria-label="Table of contents" id="sidebar"></nav><div id="page-wrapper"><div class="page"><div id="menu-bar"><h2>CLI text processing with GNU awk</h2></div><div id="content"><main><h2 id="awk-introduction"><a href="#awk-introduction">awk introduction</a></h2><p>This chapter will give an overview of <code>awk</code> syntax and some examples to show what kind of problems you could solve using <code>awk</code>. These features will be covered in depth in later, but you shouldn't skip this chapter.</p><h2 id="filtering"><a href="#filtering">Filtering</a></h2><p><code>awk</code> provides filtering capabilities like those supported by the <code>grep</code> and <code>sed</code> commands. As a programming language, there are additional nifty features as well. Similar to many command line utilities, <code>awk</code> can accept input from both stdin and files.</p><pre><code># sample stdin data
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n'
gate
apple
what
kite

# same as: grep 'at' and sed -n '/at/p'
# filter lines containing 'at'
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n' | awk '/at/'
gate
what

# same as: grep -v 'e' and sed -n '/e/!p'
# filter lines NOT containing 'e'
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n' | awk '!/e/'
what
</code></pre><p>By default, <code>awk</code> automatically loops over the input content line by line. You can then use programming instructions to process those lines. As <code>awk</code> is often used from the command line, many shortcuts are available to reduce the amount of typing needed.</p><p>In the above examples, a regular expression (defined by the pattern between a pair of forward slashes) has been used to filter the input. Regular expressions (regexp) will be covered in detail in the <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_gnuawk/regular-expressions.html#regular-expressions">next chapter</a>. String values without any special regexp characters are used in this chapter. The full syntax is <code>string ~ /regexp/</code> to check if the given string matches the regexp and <code>string !~ /regexp/</code> to check if doesn't match. When the string isn't specified, the test is performed against a special variable <code>$0</code>, which has the contents of the input line. The correct term would be input <strong>record</strong>, but that's a discussion for a <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_gnuawk/record-separators.html#record-separators">later chapter</a>.</p><p>Also, in the above examples, only the filtering condition was given. By default, when the condition evaluates to <code>true</code>, the contents of <code>$0</code> is printed. Thus:</p><ul><li><code>awk '/regexp/'</code> is a shortcut for <code>awk '$0 ~ /regexp/{print $0}'</code></li><li><code>awk '!/regexp/'</code> is a shortcut for <code>awk '$0 !~ /regexp/{print $0}'</code></li></ul><pre><code># same as: awk '/at/'
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n' | awk '$0 ~ /at/{print $0}'
gate
what

# same as: awk '!/e/'
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n' | awk '$0 !~ /e/{print $0}'
what
</code></pre><p>In the above examples, <code>{}</code> is used to specify a block of code to be executed when the condition that precedes the block evaluates to <code>true</code>. One or more statements can be given separated by the <code>;</code> character. You'll see such examples and learn more about <code>awk</code> syntax later.</p><h2 id="idiomatic-use-of-1"><a href="#idiomatic-use-of-1">Idiomatic use of 1</a></h2><p>In a conditional expression, non-zero numeric values and non-empty string values are evaluated as <code>true</code>. Idiomatically, <code>1</code> is used to denote a <code>true</code> condition in one-liners as a shortcut to print the contents of <code>$0</code>.</p><pre><code># same as: printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n' | cat
# same as: awk '{print $0}'
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n' | awk '1'
gate
apple
what
kite
</code></pre><h2 id="substitution"><a href="#substitution">Substitution</a></h2><p><code>awk</code> has three functions to cover search and replace requirements. Two of them are shown below. The <code>sub</code> function replaces only the first match, whereas the <code>gsub</code> function replaces all the matching occurrences. By default, these functions operate on <code>$0</code> when the input string isn't provided. Both <code>sub</code> and <code>gsub</code> modifies the input source on successful substitution.</p><pre><code># for each input line, change only the first ':' to '-'
# same as: sed 's/:/-/'
$ printf '1:2:3:4\na:b:c:d\n' | awk '{sub(/:/, "-")} 1'
1-2:3:4
a-b:c:d

# for each input line, change all ':' to '-'
# same as: sed 's/:/-/g'
$ printf '1:2:3:4\na:b:c:d\n' | awk '{gsub(/:/, "-")} 1'
1-2-3-4
a-b-c-d
</code></pre><p>The first argument to the <code>sub</code> and <code>gsub</code> functions is the regexp to be matched against the input content. The second argument is the replacement string. String literals are specified within double quotes. In the above examples, <code>sub</code> and <code>gsub</code> are used inside a block as they aren't intended to be used as a conditional expression. The <code>1</code> after the block is treated as a conditional expression as it is used outside a block. You can also use the variations presented below to get the same results:</p><ul><li><code>awk '{sub(/:/, "-")} 1'</code> is same as <code>awk '{sub(/:/, "-"); print $0}'</code></li><li>You can also just use <code>print</code> instead of <code>print $0</code> as <code>$0</code> is the default string</li></ul><blockquote><p><img alt="info" src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_gnuawk/images/info.svg"> You might wonder why to use or learn <code>grep</code> and <code>sed</code> when you can achieve the same results with <code>awk</code>. It depends on the problem you are trying to solve. A simple line filtering will be faster with <code>grep</code> compared to <code>sed</code> or <code>awk</code> because <code>grep</code> is optimized for such cases. Similarly, <code>sed</code> will be faster than <code>awk</code> for substitution cases. Also, not all features easily translate among these tools. For example, <code>grep -o</code> requires lot more steps to code with <code>sed</code> or <code>awk</code>. Only <code>grep</code> offers recursive search. And so on. See also <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/303044/109046">unix.stackexchange: When to use grep, sed, awk, perl, etc</a>.</p></blockquote><h2 id="field-processing"><a href="#field-processing">Field processing</a></h2><p>As mentioned before, <code>awk</code> is primarily used for field based processing. Consider the sample input file shown below with fields separated by a single space character.</p><blockquote><p><img alt="info" src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_gnuawk/images/info.svg"> The <a href="https://github.com/learnbyexample/learn_gnuawk/tree/master/example_files">example_files</a> directory has all the files used in the examples.</p></blockquote><pre><code>$ cat table.txt
brown bread mat hair 42
blue cake mug shirt -7
yellow banana window shoes 3.14
</code></pre><p>Here are some examples that are based on a specific field rather than the entire line. By default, <code>awk</code> splits the input line based on spaces and the field contents can be accessed using <code>$N</code> where <code>N</code> is the field number required. A special variable <code>NF</code> is updated with the total number of fields for each input line. There are many more details and nuances to cover regarding the default field splitting, but for now this is enough to proceed.</p><pre><code># print the second field of each input line
$ awk '{print $2}' table.txt
bread
cake
banana

# print lines only if the last field is a negative number
# recall that the default action is to print the contents of $0
$ awk '$NF&lt;0' table.txt
blue cake mug shirt -7

# change 'b' to 'B' only for the first field
$ awk '{gsub(/b/, "B", $1)} 1' table.txt
Brown bread mat hair 42
Blue cake mug shirt -7
yellow banana window shoes 3.14
</code></pre><h2 id="awk-one-liner-structure"><a href="#awk-one-liner-structure">awk one-liner structure</a></h2><p>The examples in the previous sections have used a few different ways to construct a typical <code>awk</code> one-liner. If you haven't yet grasped the syntax, this generic structure might help:</p><p><code>awk 'cond1{action1} cond2{action2} ... condN{actionN}'</code></p><p>When a condition isn't provided, the action is always executed. Within a block, you can provide multiple statements separated by the semicolon character. If an action isn't provided, then by default, contents of <code>$0</code> variable is printed if the condition evaluates to <code>true</code>. When action isn't present, you can use a semicolon to terminate a condition and start another <code>condX{actionX}</code> snippet.</p><p>Note that multiple blocks are just a syntactical sugar. It helps to avoid explicit use of <code>if</code> control structure for most one-liners. The below snippet shows the same code with and without <code>if</code> structure.</p><pre><code>$ awk '{
         if($NF &lt; 0){
            print $0
         }
       }' table.txt
blue cake mug shirt -7

$ awk '$NF&lt;0' table.txt
blue cake mug shirt -7
</code></pre><p>You can use a <code>BEGIN{}</code> block when you need to execute something before the input is read and an <code>END{}</code> block to execute something after all of the input has been processed.</p><pre><code>$ seq 2 | awk 'BEGIN{print "---"} 1; END{print "%%%"}'
---
1
2
%%%
</code></pre><p>There are some more types of blocks that can be used, you'll see them in coming chapters. See <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#All-Operators">gawk manual: Operators</a> for details about operators and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Truth-Values-and-Conditions">gawk manual: Truth Values and Conditions</a> for conditional expressions.</p><h2 id="strings-and-numbers"><a href="#strings-and-numbers">Strings and Numbers</a></h2><p>Some examples so far have already used string and numeric literals. As mentioned earlier, <code>awk</code> tries to provide a concise way to construct a solution from the command line. The data type of a value is determined based on the syntax used. String literals are represented inside double quotes. Numbers can be integers or floating-point. Scientific notation is allowed as well. See <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Constants">gawk manual: Constant Expressions</a> for more details.</p><pre><code># BEGIN{} is also useful to write an awk program without any external input
$ awk 'BEGIN{print "hi"}'
hi

$ awk 'BEGIN{print 42}'
42
$ awk 'BEGIN{print 3.14}'
3.14
$ awk 'BEGIN{print 34.23e4}'
342300
</code></pre><p>You can also save these literals in variables for later use. Some variables are predefined, <code>NF</code> for example.</p><pre><code>$ awk 'BEGIN{a=5; b=2.5; print a+b}'
7.5

# strings placed next to each other are concatenated
$ awk 'BEGIN{s1="con"; s2="cat"; print s1 s2}'
concat
</code></pre><p>If an uninitialized variable is used, it will act as an empty string in string context and <code>0</code> in numeric context. You can force a string to behave as a number by simply using it in an expression with numeric values. You can also use unary <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> operators. If the string doesn't start with a valid number (ignoring any starting whitespaces), it will be treated as <code>0</code>. Similarly, concatenating a string to a number will automatically change the number to string. See <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Strings-And-Numbers">gawk manual: How awk Converts Between Strings and Numbers</a> for more details.</p><pre><code># same as: awk 'BEGIN{sum=0} {sum += $NF} END{print sum}'
$ awk '{sum += $NF} END{print sum}' table.txt
38.14

$ awk 'BEGIN{n1="5.0"; n2=5; if(n1==n2) print "equal"}'
$ awk 'BEGIN{n1="5.0"; n2=5; if(+n1==n2) print "equal"}'
equal
$ awk 'BEGIN{n1="5.0"; n2=5; if(n1==n2".0") print "equal"}'
equal

$ awk 'BEGIN{print 5 + "abc 2 xyz"}'
5
$ awk 'BEGIN{print 5 + " \t 2 xyz"}'
7
</code></pre><h2 id="arrays"><a href="#arrays">Arrays</a></h2><p>Arrays in <code>awk</code> are associative, meaning they are key-value pairs. The keys can be numbers or strings, but numbers get converted to strings internally. They can be multi-dimensional as well. There will be plenty of array examples in later chapters in relevant context. See <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Arrays">gawk manual: Arrays</a> for complete details and gotchas.</p><pre><code># assigning an array and accessing an element based on string keys
$ awk 'BEGIN{student["id"] = 101; student["name"] = "Joe";
       print student["name"]}'
Joe

# checking if a key exists
$ awk 'BEGIN{student["id"] = 101; student["name"] = "Joe";
       if("id" in student) print "Key found"}'
Key found
</code></pre><h2 id="summary"><a href="#summary">Summary</a></h2><p>In my early days of getting used to the Linux command line, I was intimidated by <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> examples and didn't even try to learn them. Hopefully, this gentler introduction works for you and the various syntactical magic has been explained adequately. Try to experiment with the given examples, for example change field numbers to something other than the number used. Be curious, like what happens if a field number is negative or a floating-point number. Read the manual. Practice a lot. And so on.</p><p>The next chapter is dedicated solely for regular expressions. The features introduced in this chapter would be used in the examples, so make sure you are comfortable with <code>awk</code> syntax before proceeding. Solving the exercises to follow will help test your understanding.</p><h2 id="interactive-exercises"><a href="#interactive-exercises">Interactive exercises</a></h2><p>I wrote a TUI app to help you solve some of the exercises from this book interactively.

<p>In the following series of blog posts I will document my attempts to write Linux modules using the Ada language.</p>
<p>I am not a professional and my knowledge of the Linux kernel and gnat is not comprehensive. Please pardon me for any inaccuracies I make.</p>
<h2>Introduction and Motivation</h2>
<p>Linux module is a binary that can be dynamically loaded and linked into the Kernel. One major use case is device drivers. Traditionally Linux modules are written in C and built using <em>kbuild</em>, an elaborate build system that is also used to build the kernel itself.</p>
<p>Code written for a module runs in the kernel with the privileges of the kernel, meaning that a programming error can cause anomalies such a system reboot, memory corruption of applications, data corruption of the hard disk and more.</p>
<p>Ada is a language that was designed specifically for embedded safety critical applications which makes it more suitable for writing device drivers.</p>
<h2>Preparations</h2>
<p>First, I investigated the current process of writing and building modules. An example tutorial can be found <a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/2.6/html/lkmpg.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>In an nutshell, it is required to create a file that looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>/*  </span>
<span> *  hello-1.c - The simplest kernel module.</span>
<span> */</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;linux/module.h&gt;   /* Needed by all modules */</span><span></span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;linux/kernel.h&gt;   /* Needed for KERN_INFO */</span><span></span>

<span>int</span> <span>init_module</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>printk</span><span>(</span><span>KERN_INFO</span> <span>"Hello world 1.</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>/* </span>
<span>     * A non 0 return means init_module failed; module can't be loaded. </span>
<span>     */</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>cleanup_module</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>printk</span><span>(</span><span>KERN_INFO</span> <span>"Goodbye world 1.</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Additionally, a <em>mkefile</em> that looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>obj-m</span> <span>+=</span> hello-1.o

<span>all</span><span>:</span>
    make  -C /lib/modules/<span>$(</span>shell uname -r<span>)</span>/build <span>M</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>PWD<span>)</span> modules
<span>clean</span><span>:</span>
    make  -C /lib/modules/<span>$(</span>shell uname -r<span>)</span>/build <span>M</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>PWD<span>)</span> clean
</pre></div>


<p>Calling make will produce a <em><em>.ko</em></em> file which is the actual loadable module. It can be loaded and removed using the <code>insmodule</code> and <code>rmodule</code>.</p>
<p>The difference between a <em>.ko</em> and <em>.o</em> file is the additional memory sections added by the linker.</p>
<h2>The Strategy</h2>
<p>It is very tempting to abolish the cumbersome <em>kbuild</em> system and use a <em>gpr</em> file for the whole compilation and linkage. Unfortunately the makefiles that <em>kbuild</em> is made of are too complex for me to understand, and I was able to imitate everything it does to produce the "<em>.ko</em>" file. Additionally, it is not safe to work around the <em>kbuild</em> system as the internal details might change it future versions of the kernel.</p>
<p>So instead, I envision the following strategy. All the "logic" of the module will reside in Ada functions that will be compiled into a static library. The main file will be written in C and will consist of wrappers (eg <code>init_module</code>, <code>cleanup_module</code>) that will call the Ada functions. We will tell <em>kbuild</em> about the existence of the Ada library, so it will link it into the module, and everyone will be happy.</p>
<h2>Hello World with Ada</h2>
<h3>The Code</h3>
<p>The Ada files contain a function which always return a constant 42. <code>pragma Export</code> is used to export the <code>ada_foo</code> symbol.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>package</span> <span>Ada_Foo_Pack</span> <span>is</span>

   <span>function</span> <span>Ada_Foo</span> <span>return</span> <span>Integer</span><span>;</span>

<span>private</span>
   <span>pragma</span> <span>Export</span>
      <span>(</span><span>Convention</span>    <span>=&gt;</span> <span>C</span><span>,</span>
       <span>Entity</span>        <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Ada_Foo</span><span>,</span>
       <span>External_Name</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"ada_foo"</span><span>);</span>
<span>end</span> <span>Ada_Foo_Pack</span><span>;</span>

<span>:::</span><span>ada</span>
<span>package</span> <span>body</span> <span>Ada_Foo_Pack</span> <span>is</span>

   <span>Ultimate_Unswer</span> <span>:</span> <span>Integer</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

   <span>function</span> <span>Ada_Foo</span> <span>return</span> <span>Integer</span> <span>is</span>
   <span>begin</span>

      <span>return</span> <span>Ultimate_Unswer</span><span>;</span>

   <span>end</span> <span>Ada_Foo</span><span>;</span>

<span>begin</span>

   <span>--  This line of code will run during elaboration</span>
   <span>--</span>
   <span>Ultimate_Unswer</span> <span>:=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>

<span>end</span> <span>Ada_Foo_Pack</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <em>C</em> file performs the elaboration of Ada libraries by calling <code>adakernelmoduleinit</code>, and then calls <code>prink</code> with the value returned by the Ada function.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;linux/module.h&gt; /* Needed by all modules */</span><span></span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;linux/kernel.h&gt; /* Needed for KERN_INFO */</span><span></span>

<span>extern</span> <span>void</span> <span>adakernelmoduleinit</span><span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>);</span>
<span>extern</span> <span>int</span> <span>ada_foo</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>init_module</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>adakernelmoduleinit</span><span>();</span>
    <span>printk</span><span>(</span><span>KERN_ERR</span> <span>"Hello Ada %d.</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>ada_foo</span><span>());</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>void</span> <span>cleanup_module</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>printk</span><span>(</span><span>KERN_ERR</span> <span>"Goodbye Ada.</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So far nothing too complicated. However when building the module, <em>kbuild</em> complaints about many missing symbols. These missing symbols are part of the "Run Time". The calls to these methods are either produced by a compiler (for example <code>delay 0.1;</code> will implicitly call functions from the calendar package) or produced by the binder (initialization of the run time).</p>
<p>Normally, these functions can be found in <em>libgnat.so</em>, but this dynamic library is not available in the kernel space.</p>
<p>I also tried to tell <em>kbuild</em> to statically link with <em>libgnat.a</em>, but it turns out that <em>libgnat.a</em> is referencing other symbols which are supposed to be located in further libraries which complicates everything.</p>
<p>On top of this, linking the standard run time to the kernel does not make sense as it uses system calls (for example to open a file) which are available only in user space.</p>
<h3>The Run Time</h3>
<p>The solution is to build a custom, degraded run time. Such run times are also known as "<em>Zero Footprint</em>".</p>
<p>To achieve this I followed "<em><a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/Ada_Bare_bones">Ada Bare Bones</a></em>" tutorial that was written by Luke A. Guest.</p>
<p>To summarize, for building a run time, you will need <em>adainclude</em> and <em>adalib</em> directories. The first one will contain a copy of some of the files from the original run time, as well as <em>system.ads</em>, <em>gnat.ads</em> and additional custom packages. The second directory will contain the compiled library <em>libgnat.a</em>.</p>
<p>When building the kernel module library, every relevant tool needs to be called with the "<code>--RTS=</code>" flag that specify the path to the directory that contains the above two.</p>
<p>Deprating a little bit from Luke's tutorial, I did some modifications to the directory structure, the compiler flags, removed the console package and changed the <em>last chance handler</em> into a <em>null</em> function.</p>
<p>The final directory structure would look like the following diagram. I have uploaded the complete project to githhub, and you can find this version of the project by looking for the <a href="https://github.com/alkhimey/Ada_Kernel_Module_Toolkit/tree/blog-post-pt-1"><em>blog-post-pt-1</em> git tag</a>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The example module I have written is very simple proof of concept. The Ada part does not even use any of symbols exported by the kernel. In future articles I will make an attempt to write a usefull kernel module that actually does stuff.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                <p><span>G</span><span>ary Flook served</span> in the Air Force for 37 years, as a firefighter at the now-closed Chanute Air Force Base in Illinois and the former Grissom Air Force Base in Indiana, where he regularly trained with aqueous film forming foam, or AFFF — a frothy white fire retardant that is highly effective but now known to be toxic.</p>
<p>Flook volunteered at his local fire department, where he also used the foam, unaware of the health risks it posed. In 2000, at age 45, he received devastating news: He had testicular cancer, which would require an orchiectomy followed by chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Hundreds of <a href="https://undark.org/2020/02/24/toxic-battery-pfass-pfas/">lawsuits</a>, including one by Flook, have been filed against companies that make firefighting products and the chemicals used in them.</p>

<p>And <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK326822/">multiple studies</a> show that firefighters, both military and civilian, have been diagnosed with testicular cancer at higher rates than people in most other occupations, often pointing to the presence of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, in the foam.</p>
<p>But the link between PFAS and testicular cancer among service members was never directly proven — until now.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP12603">new federal study</a> for the first time shows a direct association between PFOS, a PFAS chemical, found in the blood of thousands of military personnel and testicular cancer.</p>
<p>Using banked blood drawn from Air Force servicemen, researchers at the National Cancer Institute and Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences found strong evidence that airmen who were firefighters had elevated levels of PFAS in their bloodstreams and weaker evidence for those who lived on installations with high levels of PFAS in the drinking water. And the airmen with testicular cancer had higher serum levels of PFOS than those who had not been diagnosed with cancer, said study co-author Mark Purdue, a senior investigator at NCI.</p>
<p>“To my knowledge,” Purdue said, “this is the first study to measure PFAS levels in the U.S. military population and to investigate associations with a cancer endpoint in this population, so that brings new evidence to the table.”</p>
<p>In <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/EHP13212">a commentary</a> in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, Kyle Steenland, a professor at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health, said the research “provides a valuable contribution to the literature,” which he described as “rather sparse” in demonstrating a link between PFAS and testicular cancer.</p>
<p>More studies are needed, he said, “as is always the case for environmental chemicals.”</p>
<hr>
<p><span>O</span><span>ld stocks of AFFF</span> that contained PFOS were replaced <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/02/10/firefighting-foam-afff-pfos-pfoa-epa/">in the past few decades</a> by foam that contains newer-generation PFAS, which now also are known to be toxic. By congressional order, the Department of Defense must stop using all PFAS-containing foams by October 2024, though it can keep buying them until this October. That’s decades after the military first documented the chemicals’ potential health concerns.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/1974_Biodegradability-and-Toxicity-of-ANSUL-K74-100-Aqueous-Film-Forming-Foam-1.pdf">DoD study in 1974</a> found that PFAS was fatal to fish. By 1983, <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/1983_Air-Force-Study.pdf">an Air Force technical report showed</a> its deadly effects on mice.</p>
<p>But given its effectiveness in fighting extremely hot fires, like aircraft crashes and shipboard blazes, the Defense Department still uses it in operations. Rarely, if ever, had the military warned of its dangers, according to Kevin Ferrara, a retired Air Force firefighter, as well as several military firefighters who contacted KFF Health News.</p>
<p>“We were told that it was just soap and water, completely harmless,” Ferrara said. “We were completely slathered in the foam — hands, mouth, eyes. It looked just like if you were going to fill up your sink with dish soap.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dvidshub.net/image/1025637/flurry-foam-released-travis">Photos released</a> by the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service in 2013 show personnel working in the foam without protective gear. The description calls the “small sea of fire retardant foam” at Travis Air Force Base in California “non-hazardous” and “similar to soap.”</p>
<p>“No people or aircraft were harmed in the incident,” it reads.</p>
<div>
			<p><strong>“We were told that it was just soap and water, completely harmless,” Ferrara said. “We were completely slathered in the foam.”</strong></p>
		</div>
<p>There are thousands of PFAS chemicals, invented in the 1940s to ward off stains and prevent sticking in industrial and household goods. Along with foam used for decades by firefighters and the military, the chemicals are in makeup, nonstick cookware, water-repellent clothing, rugs, food wrappers, and a myriad of other consumer goods.</p>
<p>Known as “forever chemicals,” they do not break down in the environment and do accumulate in the human body. Researchers estimate that nearly all Americans have PFAS in their blood, exposed primarily by groundwater, drinking water, soil, and foods. A recent U.S. Geological Survey study estimated that <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/tap-water-study-detects-pfas-forever-chemicals-across-us">at least 45 percent</a> of U.S. tap water has at least one type of forever chemical from both private wells and public water supplies.</p>
<p>Health and environmental concerns associated with the chemicals have spurred a cascade of lawsuits, plus <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/raincoats-undies-school-uniforms-are-your-clothes-dripping-in-forever-chemicals/">state</a> and <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/epa-pfas-rule-disclosure-forever-chemicals/">federal legislation</a> that targets the manufacturers and sellers of PFAS-laden products. Gary Flook is suing 3M and associated companies that manufactured PFAS and the firefighting foam, including DuPont and Kidde-Fenwal.</p>
<p>Congress has prodded the Department of Defense to clean up military sites and take related health concerns more seriously, funding site inspections for PFAS and mandating blood testing for military firefighters. Advocates argue those actions are not enough.</p>
<p>“How long has [DoD] spent on this issue without any real results except for putting some filters on drinking water?” said Jared Hayes, a senior policy analyst at the Environmental Working Group. “When it comes to cleaning up the problem, we are in the same place we were years ago.”</p>
<hr>
<p><span>T</span><span>he Department of</span> Veterans Affairs <a href="https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/pfas.asp">does not recommend</a> blood testing for PFAS, stating on its website that “blood tests cannot be linked to current or future health conditions or guide medical treatment decisions.”</p>
<p>But that could change soon. Rep. Dan Kildee, co-chair of the congressional PFAS Task Force, in June introduced the Veterans Exposed to Toxic PFAS Act, which would require the VA to treat conditions linked to exposure and provide disability benefits for those affected, including for testicular cancer.</p>
<p>“The last thing [veterans] and their families need to go through is to fight with VA to get access to benefits we promised them when they put that uniform on,” Kildee said.</p>
<p>Evidence is strong that exposure to PFAS is associated with health effects such as decreased response to vaccines, kidney cancer, and low birth weight, according to <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/guidance-on-pfas-testing-and-health-outcomes#sectionPublications">an expansive, federally funded report</a> published last year by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The nonprofit institution recommended blood testing for communities with high exposure to PFAS, followed by health screenings for those above certain levels.</p>
<div>
			<p><strong>“When it comes to cleaning up the problem, we are in the same place we were years ago,” said Hayes.</strong></p>
		</div>
<p>It also said that, based on limited evidence, there is “moderate confidence” of an association between exposure and thyroid dysfunction, preeclampsia in pregnant women, and breast and testicular cancers.</p>
<p>The new study of Air Force servicemen published July 17 goes further, linking PFAS exposure directly to testicular germ cell tumors, which make up roughly <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/types/testicular-germ-cell-tumors">95 percent</a> of testicular cancer cases.</p>
<p>Testicular cancer is the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563159/#:~:text=Testicular%20cancer%20is%20the%20most%20common%20cancer%20in%20young%20men,testicular%20cancer%20survive%20their%20disease.">most commonly diagnosed</a> cancer among young adult men. It is also the type of cancer diagnosed at the <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/MSMRvolume23_number7508-Cancer-Incidence-1.pdf">highest rate</a> among active military personnel, most of whom are male, ages 18 to 40, and in peak physical condition.</p>
<p>That age distribution and knowing AFFF was a source of PFAS contamination drove Purdue and USUHS researcher Jennifer Rusiecki to investigate a possible connection.</p>
<p>Using samples from the <a href="https://www.health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Health-Readiness/AFHSD/Data-Management-and-Technical-Support/Department-of-Defense-Serum-Repository">Department of Defense Serum Repository</a>, a biobank of more than 62 million blood serum specimens from service members, the researchers examined samples from 530 troops who later developed testicular cancer and those of 530 members of a control group. The blood had been collected between 1988 and 2017.</p>
<p>A second sampling collected four years after the first samples were taken showed the higher PFOS concentrations positively associated with testicular cancer.</p>
<p>Ferrara does not have testicular cancer, though he does have other health concerns he attributes to PFAS, and he worries for himself and his fellow firefighters. He recalled working at Air Combat Command headquarters at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia in the early 2010s and seeing emails mentioning two types of PFAS chemicals: PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA.</p>
<p>But employees on the base remained largely unfamiliar with the jumble of acronyms, Ferrara said.</p>

</div>
<p>Even as the evidence grew that the chemicals in AFFF were toxic, “we were still led to believe that it’s perfectly safe,” Ferrara said. “They kept putting out vague and cryptic messages, citing environmental concerns.”</p>
<p>When Ferrara was working a desk job at Air Combat Command and no longer fighting fires, his exposure likely continued: Joint Base Langley-Eustis is among the top five most PFAS-contaminated military sites, according to the EWG, with groundwater at the former Langley Air Force Base registering 2.2 million parts per trillion for PFOS and PFOA.</p>
<p>According to the EPA, just 40 parts per trillion would “warrant further attention,” such as testing and amelioration.</p>
<p>The Defense Department did not provide comment on the new study.</p>
<p>Air Force officials told KFF Health News that the service has swapped products and no longer allows uncontrolled discharges of firefighting foam for maintenance, testing, or training.</p>
<p>“The Department of the Air Force has replaced Aqueous Film Forming Foam, which contained PFAS, with a foam that meets Environmental Protection Agency recommendations at all installations,” the Air Force said in a statement provided to KFF Health News.</p>
<p>Both older-generation forever chemicals are no longer made in the U.S. 3M, the main manufacturer of PFOS, agreed to start phasing it out <a href="https://www.epa.gov/archive/epapages/newsroom_archive/newsreleases/33aa946e6cb11f35852568e1005246b4.html">in 2000</a>. In June, the industrial giant announced it would pay at least $10.3 billion to settle a class-action suit.</p>
<p>Alarmed over what it perceived as the Defense Department’s unwillingness to address PFAS contamination or stop using AFFF, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/plaws/publ92/PLAW-116publ92.pdf">Congress in 2019 ordered DoD</a> to offer annual testing for all active-duty military firefighters and banned the use of PFAS foam by 2024.</p>
<div>
			<p><strong>Even as the evidence grew that the chemicals in AFFF were toxic, “we were still led to believe that it’s perfectly safe,” Ferrara said. </strong></p>
		</div>
<p>According to data provided by DoD, among more than 9,000 firefighters who requested the tests in fiscal year 2021, 96 percent had at least one of two types of PFAS in their blood serum, with PFOS being the most commonly detected at an average level of 3.1 nanograms per milliliter.</p>
<p>Readings between 2 and 20 ng/mL carry concern for adverse effects, according to the national academies. In that range, it recommends people limit additional exposure and screen for high cholesterol, breast cancer, and, if pregnant, high blood pressure.</p>
<p>According to DoD, 707 active and former defense sites are contaminated with PFAS or have had suspected PFAS discharges. The department is in the early stages of a decades-long testing and cleaning process.</p>
<p>More than 3,300 lawsuits have been filed over AFFF and PFAS contamination; beyond 3M’s massive settlement, DuPont and other manufacturers reached a $1.185 billion agreement with water utility companies in June.</p>
<p>Attorneys general from 22 states have urged the court to reject the 3M settlement, saying in <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-leads-bipartisan-coalition-opposing-3m%E2%80%99s-proposed-pfas?print=true">a filing July 26</a> it would not adequately cover the damage caused.</p>
<p>For now, many firefighters, like Ferrara, live with anxiety that their blood PFAS levels may lead to cancer. Flook declined to speak to KFF Health News because he is part of the <a href="https://dockets.justia.com/docket/south-carolina/scdce/2:2022cv02568/273721">3M class-action lawsuit</a>. The cancer wreaked havoc on his marriage, robbing him and his wife, Linda, of “affection, assistance, and conjugal fellowship,” according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Congress is again trying to push the Pentagon. This year, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen reintroduced the PFAS Exposure Assessment and Documentation Act, which would require DoD to test all service members — not just firefighters — stationed at installations with known or suspected contamination as part of their annual health checkups as well as family members and veterans.</p>
<p>The tests, which aren’t covered by the military health program or most insurers, typically cost from $400 to $600.</p>
<p>In June, Kildee said veterans have been stymied in getting assistance with exposure-related illnesses that include PFAS.</p>
<p>“For too long, the federal government has been too slow to act to deal with the threat posed by PFAS exposure,” Kildee said. “This situation is completely unacceptable.”</p>

<p>Part of being ready to die comes, I think, from psychedelics; I wrote in “<a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/07/23/how-do-we-evaluate-our-lives-at-the-end-what-counts-what-matters/">How do we evaluate our lives, at the end? What counts, what matters?</a>”: “Bess (my wife) and psychedelics taught me to love, and the importance of love, and yet too soon now I must give everything back.” There’s a longer, yet-to-be-written essay about how psychedelics cause me to see myself as a tiny instantiation of the vast, interconnected human whole, which will comfortingly go on even when I flicker out. Michael Pollan’s book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Change-Your-Mind-Consciousness-Transcendence/dp/0735224153?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thstsst-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><em>How to Change Your Mind</em></a> is great and also covers a lot of existential territory. I’m looking for a copy to quote from and can’t find it, because I’ve given so many copies away. Pollan describes the way psychedelics are being used palliatively for end-of-life care, which is, strangely where I now find myself. Fortunately, I have a Kindle copy, and now I can authoritatively say that Pollan writes about how “researchers [have] been giving large doses of psilocybin—the active ingredient in magic mushrooms—to terminal cancer patients as a way to help them deal with their ‘existential distress’ at the approach of death.” Moreover, for many people, “psychedelics [help] to escape the prison of self.” I guess I can say that psychedelics prophylactically assuaged my fear of death, the way Zofran might be taken to prevent nausea.</p>



<p>Even before the present circumstances, though, from psychedelics I learned how not just to know but to deeply feel and internalize that we’re all part of the show for such a short time, and then it’s someone else’s turn, and that is okay. Until science radically expands healthy lives—which will be great, but it’s not clear whether we’re near to or far from that series of breakthroughs—we’re not here for long, and then we yield up the gift, whether willing with grace or unwillingly with fear. But the other part of being ready to die comes from how much living physically sucks for me, much of the time, with a lot of struggles concerning breathing and mucus.</p>



<p>The breathing and mucus are related; if you’ve spent much time around me, you’ve seen and heard that I’m endlessly trying to hack up mucus—sometimes succeeding. If you’ve not spent much time around me, take my word for it, and enjoy that no demonstration videos are included. I’m constantly attempting to clear the back of my throat and spit mucus up. The attempts to hack up and spit out mucus can sort of work for a short period of time, but even when I hack up a huge blob of mucus, the feeling of needing to do so again, or drowning, returns within a few minutes. Often, I’m attempting to hack up mucus that won’t quite come out. I struggle for hours against some plugs, knowing that they’re in my throat but unable to expel them. It feels like I’m heroically and single-handedly supporting the Kleenex industry with all the tissues I’m going through.</p>



<p>I can never breath normally. Never. Not even when things are going relatively well. Contemplate what that means. You’re probably breathing normally right now, and not even noticing that you’re breathing, which is what my life was like until <a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/08/16/how-much-suffering-is-too-much/">the massive May 25 surgery</a>, which left me without a tongue. The prior surgery in Octoboer 2022—my first for the squamous cell carcinoma—and even the radiation from December 2022 to January 2023 were not easy, but I’ve described them to friends as “predominantly cosmetic damage.” My body repaired itself tolerably well in response to them. By March 2023 I could speak and swallow within spitting distance of normal. Recovery wasn’t instantaneous but most of my original functions and functioning returned. Strangers might have wondered about the neck scar, where Dr. Hinni, the ENT who led the surgery, removed all the lymph nodes from the left side, because squamous cell carcinomas of the neck usually metastasize first to the lymph nodes. Those lymph nodes were all clean, leading him to think that, after a successful surgery where the margins were clear, and radiation to kill any remaining errant cancerous cells, I’d be healed.</p>



<p>During my first appointment with Dr. Hinni, in September or October 2022, after reviewing treatment options, he leaned forward, took my hand, patted me on the shoulder and said, “Don’t worry. This isn’t going to be what kills you.” If this were a novel, an editor would chide me for a too-obvious <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov’s gun</a>. “Everyone knows what will happen if you write this,” the editor would say. But I didn’t anticipate my life would be narrated by a heavy-handed horror author. Joke’s on us. On April 26, 2023, the first post-treatment PET scan showed a hot spot that turned out to be a squamous cell carcinoma at the base of the tongue. Half the tongue was supposed to come out, and be replaced with a “flap” of muscle taken one of my quadriceps. Instead, when Dr. Hinni got into the surgery, he found that the cancer had spread across the base of the tongue, invading not only the left lingual artery, which provides blood flow to the left side of the tongue, but the right lingual artery as well. Without those arteries, the tongue can’t survive.</p>



<p>Dr. Hinni also discovered that the tumor had extensive perineural invasion – meaning it latched on to, and probably traveled to the base of my tongue on, important nerves controlling neck muscles and oropharyngeal sensation. Some of those cancerous nerves had to come out, and I guess at least one controlled mucus, because today I feel like a mucus factory. The inflammation from the massive surgery and the tumors creates yet more mucus. The radiation, which, while minimally affecting my cancer, left me with the gift of salivary gland changes, so now my body produces a particularly thick, sticky mucous. I can’t properly feel that mucus because I’m missing sensation in half my interior oropharynx. Because of the surgery and nerve removal, I can’t swallow normally to clear the mucus. It’s difficult to wrap my head around the knowledge that I can’t feel half my throat, because it’s hard to imagine a more pronounced feeling than the one I live with day in, day out. This mutant mucus either gets created in my mouth or throat, or flows relentlessly downwards from the back of nose.</p>



<p>Consequently, every breath enters my nose or mouth and triggers a Rube-Goldberg-like chain reaction of misery. The mucus in turn captures my attention and sends a signal that says: “Hey, you can’t breathe correctly. Attend to this.” With every breath, a signal registers, encouraging me to try to clear my throat or else warning my conscious mind that I might not be able to breathe. This happens all day, every day, as if on a mechanism whose trigger to start the process over is the moment I finally clear my airway. It’s like being in an ER with a beeping airway machine that never shuts off, ever, and can’t be fixed or silenced. While I tried to dismiss earlier surgery and radiation as “cosmetic damage,” despite the struggles they brought, that massive May 25 surgery is “structural damage.”</p>



<p>I’m like Sisyphus pushing his boulder up the hill, except the boulder is mucus, which seems worse—at least a boulder doesn’t stick to the hill. I’m a little better at swallowing than I used to be, but I can’t tilt my head back much to get enough of an assist from gravity, because my neck is so tight from surgeries, from scar tissue, and from radiation. Swallowing—one of the acts that might help—is made far harder by neck tightness. My neck is getting tighter, not looser, over time, because radiation scarring tends to present many months after the treatment. And the area is filled with post-operative scar tissue. And, maybe most importantly, this is where the tumors are growing. I’m trapped in this tightening, constricting, gooey head-and-neck system that I can’t escape from and that causes me to constantly be spitting into tissues or sinks or the ground or whatever other appropriate receptacle I can find.</p>



<p>My neck, and my universe, feel steadily more constricted.</p>



<p>When I’m infusing food—which eats like four hours, daily—through the peg tube in my stomach, the mucus problems become worse, as if my body is readying itself to take food in through the mouth, but none comes via the oral route. When I wake up in the morning, or at night, I’m dry, and the mucus plugs are even harder to expel than they are during the day. When I try to speak, I’m often stymied by mucus rattling around and preventing my vocal chords from vibrating freely. To speak, I must try to hack up mucus first, which isn’t a great way to start or have a conversation.</p>



<p>So often I feel disgusting all day, every day, because of the endless effort to hack up mucus. Sometimes I succeed. It’s gross for me, and it’s gross for whoever might be around me; friends are very polite to say that it’s fine, and I appreciate the politeness, but even if it’s fine for them, it’s disgusting for me. I leave trails of spit-out saliva and spit-up tissues wherever I go. All day I’m physically weak. All day my body hurts from lack of motion. Those cancerous nerves had important functions, and, while I obviously understand why they had to be removed, they’re part of the irreparable structural damage, which can’t be wholly assuaged. If you’ve guessed that these physical problems lead to poor sleep, you are correct.&nbsp;I’m very different, in worse ways, than I was.</p>



<p>When the <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/tracheostomy">tracheostomy tube</a> came out—I had what amounts to a plastic breathing tube sticking out of the base of my neck for six or seven weeks after the surgery—I thought that I was making irreversible progress. Instead, getting the trache removed did increase comfort and wholeness because there wasn’t a foreign body poking into and out of my neck, but I also had to learn to suffer breathing through the mucus, and battling the mucus. I don’t want that tube back, but it did bypass the mucus junction. </p>



<p>I look for upsides. I let Bess’s love succor and sustain me, I try to make progress, I have moments when I laugh, I celebrate the wins—and yet the base fact of being irreparably damaged remains. The struggles with breathing remain. The persistent intrusive thoughts about whether this thing, life, is worth it, remain. They’re not questions therapy can help with. They’re questions intrinsic to the damage. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Without those nerves between my neck and mouth and nose, and without a good ability to swallow, my lot is constantly fighting the mucus attacks. I feel like a human mucus factory. What’s the end of this? When is the end? Sometimes, I’m ready for it.</p>



<p>Look, since you’re probably thinking it, and before you point it out, let me say that I’m aware that there’s worse suffering in the world than hacking up mucus and feeling like I can’t breathe. There are displaced persons in war-torn countries, and persons who may have experienced horrible brutality or seen horrible brutality visited on their families or friends. There is the savagery and prosecutable cruelty the Russian military is inflicting on and in Ukraine. Comparatively, there are people worse off than me who seem to find ways forward towards meaningful lives. In some ways, my material universe is still impressive, and I’m blessed with love.</p>



<p>Napoleon Chagnon’s memoir <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Noble-Savages-Dangerous-Yanomamo-Anthropologists/dp/0684855119?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thstsst-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><em>Noble Savages: My Life Among Two Dangerous Tribes — the Yanomamo and the Anthropologists</em></a> talks about what everyday life among the Yanomaö, a series of native peoples and tribes then living in Brazil and Venezuela, is like. Chagnon says he is “not ashamed to admit that” when he first met the Yanomamö, “had there been a diplomatic way out, I would have ended my fieldwork then and there.” The physical circumstances were that tough. Chagnon writes: “imagine the hygienic consequences of camping for about three years in the same small place with two hundred companions without sewers, running water, or garbage collection, and you get a sense of what daily life is like among the Yanomamö. And what it was like for much of human history, for that matter.” To Chagnon, the village smells of “decaying vegetations, dog feces, and garbage.” Yanomamö men appear to spend a lot of their lives with “strands of dark green snot [dripping or hanging] from their nostrils” because of their fondness for snorting a hallucinogenic drug called ebene. Men continually engage in small-group warfare and a huge proportion of adult men die in war, at the hands of other humans. A huge proportion of adult women die in childbirth, and many are abducted and then forcibly married to one of their abductors or into their abductors’ group. And that is normal life. Maybe that was normal life for most humans in most of human history, as Chagnon notes. I’ve never spent much time fantasizing about living in a past time, because life then was overwhelmingly filthy, mostly impoverished, and there wasn’t access to basic antibiotics, let alone chemotherapy, radiation and clinical trials. &nbsp;A future era? That I can and do imagine. I also imagine that I would’ve quit fieldwork even without a diplomatic way out. Maybe not on the first day, but as close to it as I could get.</p>



<p>“Normal” is a tricky word that means all sorts of situations. Wherever we grow up is normal. Normal for me now means dealing with the mucus and drowning sensations. I feel recent suffering keenly. Enough suffering makes a person feel less than human, including me. Humans can get used to so much; can I get used to my problems? I’m not the first to wonder, as Bess did: “<a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/08/16/how-much-suffering-is-too-much/">How much suffering is too much?</a>” Viktor Frankl wrote extensively about suffering and human life, most notably in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl/dp/0807014273?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thstsst-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957"><em>Man’s Search for Meaning</em></a> (a favorite book). “<a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/yes-to-life">Yes to Life</a>: Viktor Frankl survived the Holocaust and created a new psychology in which the search for meaning—not pleasure or power—is mankind’s central motivational force,” by Samuel Kronen, is about Frankl, and it describes how “Life carries the potential for meaning under any circumstance.” I buy that argument, albeit with a heavy emphasis on the word “potential.” The gap between the potential and actual is often large, and it’s up to the individual to find and create meaning in life.</p>



<p>Frankl’s endurance and his apparent ability to not merely survive but to thrive is exemplary; I’m not sure how well I’d do after finding that “Except for his younger sister, who managed to flee the country, everyone in his immediate family, including his pregnant wife, Tilly, died in the Holocaust.” In Frankl’s version of psychotherapy, which he called logotherapy, “One could even say that the meaning of life is other people.” So how does one go on when the other people who are most important to you are murdered? Frankl’s life and writings are his answer. <a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/06/29/a-life-changing-encounter-with-a-man-named-dan/">Like Dan</a>, he seems to have developed a stunning ability to go on and remain positive in the face of adversity. As much as I admire Frankl, I find myself leaning away from this: “No amount of anguish or adversity can truly take away our humanity, he says. Being human precedes our capacity to be productive, functional, or even mentally sound.” I wonder whether being human is a binary thing or a matter of degrees; I lean towards the latter, which you can see in my comment about how enough suffering makes a person feel less than human.</p>



<p>I’m not able, or maybe willing, to sustain the positivity and meaningfulness of Frankl or Dan. At some point, to my mind and temperament, it’s not worth going on. But I can’t precisely demarcate point where there’s too much suffering or too much privation, though I’ve considered many scenarios. That I’m still here, right now, indicates the present privations aren’t too much. Not yet. Much has been taken from me, but I still have Bess’s love. I can still locomote. Speech is garbled but possible. Every day I’m trying to make a good and generative day, and I remind myself that there are many things I can’t control, but, as both Frankl and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Stoic-Meditations-Wisdom-Perseverance/dp/0735211736?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=piooiseujk-20&amp;linkId=6b46592bbc23b3bb210ef701669a1904&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">the Stoics</a> emphasize, I can control my attitude.</p>



<p>Despite the mucus, I have some victories: I can swallow some food and have gotten steadily better at swallowing. Maybe a month ago, my friend and speech pathologist (in that order) <a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/08/16/how-much-suffering-is-too-much/">Jessica Gregor</a> helped teach me to swallow again. Swallowing without a tongue is tricky. Do it wrong and whatever you swallow goes into your lungs, causing coughing and possibly worse. But when someone without a tongue, who hasn’t swallowed for two months, learns how to swallow again, the moment of swallowing includes a sense that something is going into the lungs, even if nothing is.</p>



<p>There’s a trick to swallowing after your tongue has been taken: you have to tilt your head back, initiate the swallow, swallow strongly and deliberately without hesitation, and then do a throat-clearing sound and motion. That throat-clearing sound and motion forces air up and out of the lungs, closing the epiglottis in a move called a “glottal stop,” which effectively closes off the airway and makes the esophagus the only option for food to travel through. If there’s any material thing in the way, like recently swallowed food slurry, then the air will also help that substance be routed into the stomach, not the lungs.</p>



<p>With Jessica, I swallowed some ice cream slurry: the Van Leeuwen’s honeycomb flavor. We melted it and blended it with some extra milk, to thin it. And, although I was intensely skeptical that this would result in a meaningful sensory experience, there are taste buds at the back of the throat and esophagus. So I could <em>taste</em> ice cream. Since that night I’ve tried lots of things. Anything acidic, like lentil-soup slurry with too much lemon, doesn’t work well yet. Anything salty, same problem. But savory foods work and so do sweet ones. There’s a fun bakery and wine shop in Tempe called <a href="http://www.tracydempseyoriginals.com/">Tracy Dempsey Originals</a> that we’ve been going to. Tracy Dempsey makes spectacular ice cream flavors—particularly her cardamom with fig jam. It turns out I can eat things like cookies and brownies if they’re blended with milk or coffee.</p>



<p>Rough, crumbly, and dry things aren’t any good, but anything that can be made into a smooth, pretty consistent slurry, I should be able to eat. Suddenly I’m talking with Bess about stopping by <a href="http://www.fnbrestaurant.com/">FnB</a> (our favorite restaurant in Arizona, and conveniently down the street from us) to order food and blend it. We tried that too soon—I wasn’t ready yet—but will try again. That is the human struggle: to fail, to learn, and to try again. The universe is vast, cold, and indifferent, and it wants to eat you. But I’d like to eat too. And being given the chance to do so again, when I thought I would go the rest of my life without flavor, is no small thing.</p>



<p>The victories aren’t complete. The mucus still interrupts eating: anything I swallow seems to get trapped in mucus. So I swallow some food, and, when I’m done, I have to hack up food-infused mucus. There’s no clear path, I guess, from mouth to stomach without traversing a mucus swamp. The mucus swamp seems to increase the drowning sensations from slurries, and the sensation that food is going down the airway, even when it’s not. Jessica did a “Fluoroscopic Swallow Study,” which essentially means taking an x-ray video of me swallowing, to see where the swallowed substance goes. It confirmed that I’m not swallowing into my lungs, though every time I swallow I feel like I might be. That sensation, like the drowning sensation from mucus accrual, is disconcerting, but what can I do about it? Very little, it seems. Mucinex, suction, saline nebulizers and increasing my water intake does <em>something</em>, sort of, but not enough. For however long I live—and Bess has a good lead on a clinical trial, as well as an essay in the works about how the clinical trial process actually works (and how insane the process is)—the drowning sensation will be haunting me.</p>



<p>But I do get to taste some ice cream again, before the end.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  Recently, the large language models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary ability
in understanding natural language and generating programming code. It has been
a common practice of software engineers to consult LLMs when encountering
coding questions. Although efforts have been made to avoid syntax errors and
align the code with the intended semantics, the reliability and robustness of
the code generationfrom LLMs have not yet been thoroughly studied. The
executable code is not equivalent to the reliable and robust code, especially
in the context of real-world software development.The misuse of APIs in the
generated code could lead to severe problem, such as resource leaks, program
crashes, <a href="http://etc.to/" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a> make things worse, the users of LLM code generation services
are actually the developers that are most vulnerable to these code that seems
right -- They are always novice developers that are not familiar with the APIs
that LLMs generate code for them. Therefore, they could hardly tell the misuse
in the code generated by LLMs, which further facilitates the incorrect code
applied in real-world software. Existing code evaluation benchmark and datasets
focus on crafting small tasks such as programming questions in coding
interviews, which however deviates from the problem that developers would ask
LLM for real-world coding help. To fill the missing piece, in this work, we
propose a dataset RobustAPI for evaluating the reliability and robustness of
code generated by LLMs. We collect 1208 coding questions from StackOverflow on
24 representative Java APIs. We summarize thecommon misuse patterns of these
APIs and evaluate them oncurrent popular LLMs. The evaluation results show that
evenfor GPT-4, 62% of the generated code contains API misuses,which would cause
unexpected consequences if the code isintroduced into real-world software.

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Quickstart with NetBird Cloud</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Download and install NetBird at <a href="https://app.netbird.io/install" rel="nofollow">https://app.netbird.io/install</a></li>
<li>Follow the steps to sign-up with Google, Microsoft, GitHub or your email address.</li>
<li>Check NetBird <a href="https://app.netbird.io/" rel="nofollow">admin UI</a>.</li>
<li>Add more machines.</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Quickstart with self-hosted NetBird</h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">This is the quickest way to try self-hosted NetBird. It should take around 5 minutes to get started if you already have a public domain and a VM.
Follow the <a href="https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/selfhosted-guide#advanced-guide-with-a-custom-identity-provider" rel="nofollow">Advanced guide with a custom identity provider</a> for installations with different IDPs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Infrastructure requirements:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A Linux VM with at least <strong>1CPU</strong> and <strong>2GB</strong> of memory.</li>
<li>The VM should be publicly accessible on TCP ports <strong>80</strong> and <strong>443</strong> and UDP ports: <strong>3478</strong>, <strong>49152-65535</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Public domain</strong> name pointing to the VM.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Software requirements:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Docker installed on the VM with the docker compose plugin (<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" rel="nofollow">Docker installation guide</a>) or docker with docker-compose in version 2 or higher.</li>
<li><a href="https://jqlang.github.io/jq/" rel="nofollow">jq</a> installed. In most distributions

</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Download and run the installation script:</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Once finished, you can manage the resources via <code>docker-compose</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">A bit on NetBird internals</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Every machine in the network runs <a href="https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/blob/main/client">NetBird Agent (or Client)</a> that manages WireGuard.</li>
<li>Every agent connects to <a href="https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/blob/main/management">Management Service</a> that holds network state, manages peer IPs, and distributes network updates to agents (peers).</li>
<li>NetBird agent uses WebRTC ICE implemented in <a href="https://github.com/pion/ice">pion/ice library</a> to discover connection candidates when establishing a peer-to-peer connection between machines.</li>
<li>Connection candidates are discovered with a help of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN" rel="nofollow">STUN</a> servers.</li>
<li>Agents negotiate a connection through <a href="https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/blob/main/signal">Signal Service</a> passing p2p encrypted messages with candidates.</li>
<li>Sometimes the NAT traversal is unsuccessful due to strict NATs (e.g. mobile carrier-grade NAT) and p2p connection isn't possible. When this occurs the system falls back to a relay server called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT" rel="nofollow">TURN</a>, and a secure WireGuard tunnel is established via the TURN server.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/coturn/coturn">Coturn</a> is the one that has been successfully used for STUN and TURN in NetBird setups.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a groundbreaking study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06424-7">published today in <em>Nature</em></a>, Australian scientists have resolved a long-standing problem in regenerative medicine. Led by Professor Ryan Lister from the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research and The University of Western Australia and Professor Jose M Polo from Monash University and the University of Adelaide, the team developed a new method to reprogram human cells to better mimic embryonic stem cells, with significant implications for biomedical and therapeutic uses.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In a revolutionary advance in the mid-2000s, it was discovered that the non-reproductive adult cells of the body, called ‘somatic’ cells, could be artificially reprogrammed into a state that resembles embryonic stem (ES) cells which have the capacity to then generate any cell of the body. </p>
<p>The ability to artificially reprogram human somatic cells, such as skin cells, into these so-called induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells provided a way to make an essentially unlimited supply of ES-like cells, with widespread applications in disease modelling, drug screening and cell-based therapies.</p>
<p>“However, a persistent problem with the conventional reprograming process is that iPS cells can retain an epigenetic memory of their original somatic state, as well as other epigenetic abnormalities,” Professor Lister said. “This can create functional differences between the iPS cells and the ES cells they’re supposed to imitate, and specialised cells subsequently derived from them, which limits their use,”.</p>
<p>Professor Jose Polo, who is also with the Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, explained that they have now developed a new method, called transient-naive-treatment (TNT) reprogramming, that mimics the reset of a cell’s epigenome that happens in very early embryonic development. </p>
<p>“This significantly reduces the differences between iPS cells and ES cells and maximises the effectiveness of how human iPS cells can be applied,” he said.</p>
<p>Dr Sam Buckberry, a computational scientist from UWA, the Harry Perkins Institute, and Telethon Kids Institute, and co-first author of the study, said by studying how the somatic cell epigenome changed throughout the reprogramming process, they pinpointed when epigenetic aberrations emerged, and introduced a new epigenome reset step to avoid them and erase the memory. </p>
<p>Dr Xiaodong Liu, a stem cell scientist who also spearheaded the research said the new human TNT-iPS cells much more closely resembled human ES cells – both molecularly and functionally – than those produced using conventional reprograming. </p>
<p>Dr Daniel Poppe, a cell biologist from UWA, the Harry Perkins Institute and co-first author, said the iPS cells generated using the TNT method differentiated into many other cells, such as neuron progenitors, better than the iPS cells generated with the standard method.</p>
<p>Monash University student and co-first author Jia Tan, said the team’s TNT method was dynamite.</p>
<p>“It solves problems associated with conventionally generated iPS cells that if not addressed could have severely detrimental consequences for cell therapies in the long run,” he said. </p>
<p>Professor Polo said the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the iPS epigenome aberrations and their correction were not fully known, and further research was needed to understand them.</p>
<p>“We predict that TNT reprogramming will establish a new benchmark for cell therapies and biomedical research, and substantially advance their progress,” Professor Lister said.</p>
<p>The collaborative research project also included researchers from the Australian National University, Westlake University, Queen Mary University of London, Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland, Queensland Brain Institute, South Australian Health &amp; Medical Research Institute, Duke-NUS Medical School and CSIRO.</p>

<div>
<p>In most instances, put the verb in the active voice rather than in the passive voice. Passive voice produces a sentence in which the subject receives an action. In contrast, active voice
produces a sentence in which the subject performs an action.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Writers often combine independent clauses in a single compound sentence to emphasize a close relationship between ideas. The punctuation of compound sentences varies depending upon how you connect the clauses.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Concise writing is key to clear communication. Wordiness obscures your ideas and frustrates your reader. Make your points succinctly.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Apostrophes may indicate possession or mark omitted letters in contractions. Writers often misuse apostrophes when forming plurals and possessives. The basic rule is quite simple:
use the apostrophe to indicate possession, not a plural.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Misplaced and dangling modifiers create illogical, even comical, sentences. We confuse our readers if we fail to connect modifiers (words that describe or limit other words) to the words they modify; be sure to place modifiers next to the words they modify.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Pronouns are useful as substitutes for nouns, but a poorly chosen pronoun can obscure the meaning of a sentence. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Learning to write clearly and effectively is at the heart of Hamilton College’s mission statement: “Hamilton students learn to think independently, embrace difference, write and speak persuasively, and engage issues ethically and creatively.” We asked our professors to share some common writing mistakes.</p>

                                The Australian company SYPAQ has officially announced that its Corvo cardboard drones are currently in use in Ukraine.

The Corvo Precision Payload Delivery System (PPDS) is not a conventional drone, at least structurally speaking: it is a drone made entirely of cardboard. It was developed in Melbourne through a $1.1 million partnership with the Australian Defence Force (ADF). It was initially developed for transporting and dropping light equipment for isolated soldiers during operations (ammunition, first aid kit,...). After receiving feedback from the Ukrainian military, SYPAQ also added an intelligence and surveillance capability to perform reconnaissance missions.</p><p>The equipment being sensitive as it is offered to Ukraine, SYPAQ gives very little information about this drone; hand-launched or from a very light platform, 120 kilometers range.&nbsp;</p><p>It is interesting in various aspects:</p><ul><li>Simple production, with only a few parts requiring a certain level of precision.</li><li>Low logistical footprint; the aircraft comes in the form of a cardboard plate a little larger than a pizza box.</li><li>Easy construction; you simply need to remove the various parts from the cardboard plate with a knife and then build the drone using glue, tape and some rubber bands. You only need to use a wrench to attach the propeller to the motor.</li><li>Easy to use: autonomous flight (GPS) through an interface that can be installed on an Android tablet. In case of jamming, the flight continues because the drone can locate itself according to its speed and direction.</li><li>Multiple capabilities: reconnaissance and ultra-light transport.

            <span>Abstract:</span>  Model editing techniques modify a minor proportion of knowledge in Large
Language Models (LLMs) at a relatively low cost, which have demonstrated
notable success. Existing methods assume Transformer Layer (TL) hidden states
are values of key-value memories of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN). They
usually optimize the TL hidden states to memorize target knowledge and use it
to update the weights of the FFN in LLMs. However, the information flow of TL
hidden states comes from three parts: Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA), FFN,
and residual connections. Existing methods neglect the fact that the TL hidden
states contains information not specifically required for FFN. Consequently,
the performance of model editing decreases. To achieve more precise model
editing, we analyze hidden states of MHSA and FFN, finding that MHSA encodes
certain general knowledge extraction patterns. This implies that MHSA weights
do not require updating when new knowledge is introduced. Based on above
findings, we introduce PMET, which simultaneously optimizes Transformer
Component (TC, namely MHSA and FFN) hidden states, while only using the
optimized TC hidden states of FFN to precisely update FFN weights. Our
experiments demonstrate that PMET exhibits state-of-the-art performance on both
the COUNTERFACT and zsRE datasets. Our ablation experiments substantiate the
effectiveness of our enhancements, further reinforcing the finding that the
MHSA encodes certain general knowledge extraction patterns and indicating its
storage of a small amount of factual knowledge. Our code is available at

<h2>AsmBB project</h2>
<p>This is an engine for web based message board (forum) implemented entirely in assembly language, using FastCGI interface and SQLite database as a storage.</p>

<p>It is aimed to be the fast and light message board engine and still to be able to provide modern look and feel and all needed features for high active Internet community.</p>

<p>A demo of the engine is installed on <a href="https://board.asm32.info/">https://board.asm32.info</a> for evaluation. </p>

<p>You can download zip/gz packages of the sources, from this site, but the preferred way is to clone the whole repository, using fossil:</p>

<pre><code>$fossil clone https://asm32.info/fossil/repo/asmbb  /%path_to_repositories%/asmbb.fossil
</code></pre>

<p>Then open the repository:</p>

<pre><code>$mkdir asmbb
$cd asmbb
$fossil open /%path_to_repositories%/asmbb.fossil
</code></pre>

<p>Later only update the sources from the checkout directories:</p>

<pre><code>$fossil update
</code></pre>

<p>In order to compile the project you will need to clone and checkout the latest version of <strong>FreshLibDev</strong> branch of <a href="http://fresh.flatassembler.net/fossil/repo/fresh/home">Fresh IDE repository</a> and <a href="https://flatassembler.net/">flatassembler</a> or <a href="https://fresh.flatassembler.net/">Fresh IDE</a> as compiler.</p>

<p>Some environment variables are needed to be set: <code>TargetOS</code> = "Linux" or "Win32" and <code>lib</code> = the path to the <code>freshlib/</code> directory of FreshLibDev checkout.</p>

<p>As long as there is no big interest to the project, I will not write detailed instructions. FASM programmers should be able to compile it. Other programmers will probably not even try. :)</p>

<p>Carbon offset projects claiming to curb deforestation are significantly overestimating their impact, according to a new study published in Science on Thursday.</p>
<p>Sold as a way to lessen the impact of greenhouse gas emissions by allowing polluters or consumers to purchase offsets or credits that allow them to keep emitting in return for funding projects that decrease emissions elsewhere, offsets have become a high-profile model for corporate climate action.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>But a systematic evaluation of 26 carbon offset projects that claim to slow the rate of potential deforestation in six countries on three continents found that the vast majority of projects did not actually slow deforestation, and those that did were significantly less effective than they claimed.</p>
<p>“The main message is that relying on [carbon offset] certification is not enough,” said the study’s lead author, Thales West, an interdisciplinary ecologist and assistant professor at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam and a fellow at Cambridge’s Centre for Environment, Energy and Natural Resources. “If you rely 100 percent on offsets, you probably will not do anything positive in terms of mitigating climate change.”</p>
<p>The study focuses on voluntary REDD+, or Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation projects. These are standalone projects that operate independently in the voluntary carbon offset market, outside of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s REDD+ framework for national and subnational projects. The authors call for “urgent revisions” to the certification methods used to attribute avoided deforestation to these projects, pointing out major flaws in current practice.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Over the past few decades<strong>,</strong> carbon offsets have become increasingly ubiquitous, particularly in higher-income countries, where consumers can assuage their climate guilt by paying a little extra for a flight ticket or a rental car, with the understanding that their additional payment will go towards supporting a tree farm, for example. Big, high-emitting companies like <a href="https://apnews.com/article/delta-airlines-lawsuit-carbon-credits-carbon-neutral-469f2671010ba7f40c934cc23d62149a">Delta</a>, <a href="https://www.jetblue.com/sustainability/offset-your-flight">JetBlue</a>, <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/app/uploads/Striking-a-Balance-1.pdf">Disney</a>, <a href="https://news.gm.com/newsroom.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2021/jan/0128-carbon.html">General Motors</a> and <a href="https://www.shell.com/shellenergy/othersolutions/welcome-to-shell-environmental-products/working-with-customers-to-compensate-for-their-emissions.html">Shell</a> have all bought and sold huge amounts of carbon offsets in the name of climate action. It’s an attractive business model for companies looking to “go green” without significant changes in their operations: purchase some carbon offsets to cancel out your emissions. Or, at least, appear to.</p>
<p>Ever since carbon offsets hit the market, there’s been significant debate over whether or not they’re an effective model for climate mitigation. The Cambridge study illustrates a basic problem: many carbon offsets aimed at reducing deforestation are not nearly as effective as they claim to be. And in a lot of cases, they may not be doing anything at all.</p>
<p>Julia Jones, a PhD conservation scientist at Bangor University focused on conservation impact evaluation, said the study’s unique methods make it especially compelling and set it apart from other research in the field.</p>
<p><strong>“</strong>Their study is definitely the largest in scope and using pretty much the most robust methods at the moment,” said Jones, who was not involved in the study.</p>
<p>The study looked at 26 projects in six countries: Cambodia, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Peru, Tanzania, and Zambia. Researchers found that only eight of the 26 projects selling offsets showed any evidence of reducing deforestation, and even those that did failed to achieve the extent of reductions that the projects claimed.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Only 18 of the 26 projects had sufficient publicly available information to determine the number of offsets they were projected to produce. From project implementation until 2020, those 18 projects were expected to generate up to 89 million carbon offsets to be sold in the global carbon market. But researchers estimate that only 5.4 million of the 89 million, or 6.1 percent, would be associated with actual carbon emission reductions.</p>
<p>West said companies that are buying and selling carbon offsets that have been certified by third-party entities may not be aware that they’re misleading their customers—they might simply trust that the certification is legitimate. But the processes used to evaluate the projects’ effectiveness for certification are deeply flawed, he said.</p>
<p>Most projects look at historical deforestation within a region to forecast a baseline deforestation rate, or the amount of deforestation that would have happened without the project’s intervention, West said. The problem is, it’s all based on hypotheticals.</p>
<p>“They’re not really doing good science,” he said.</p>
<p>West and his colleagues took a different approach. They created a weighted average of regions that are similar to the project area but don’t house any projects, and used that as a “synthetic control.” Then, they compared deforestation in the synthetic control areas with the project areas during the period of time that the project was active. If projects are successfully reducing deforestation, then those project areas should exhibit less deforestation than the synthetic controls. Instead, West and his colleagues found that usually wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>Jones emphasized that the takeaway from the study is that there needs to be increased investment in effective projects for deforestation reduction, not a disinvestment in forest protection. The voluntary carbon market has become a crucial source of funding for forest conservation initiatives, she said, and this funding needs to continue.</p>
<p>“We simply cannot tackle climate change without stopping both tropical forest deforestation and forest degradation now,” Jones said. “It’s a real urgent priority.”</p>

    <p>I'm looking for an algorithm which when given a latitude and longitude pair and a vector translation in meters in Cartesian coordinates (x,y) would give me a new coordinate. Sort of like a reverse Haversine. I could also work with a distance and a heading transformation, but this would probably be slower and not as accurate. Ideally, the algorithm should be fast as I'm working on an embedded system. Accuracy is not critical, within 10 meters would be good.</p>

    <p>If your displacements aren't too great (less than a few kilometers) and you're not right at the poles, use the quick and dirty estimate that 111,111 meters (111.111 km) in the y direction is 1 degree (of latitude) and 111,111 * cos(latitude) meters in the x direction is 1 degree (of longitude).</p>

<p>As Liedman says in his answer Williams’s aviation formulas are an invaluable source, and to keep the accuracy within 10 meters for displacements up to 1 km you’ll probably need to use the more complex of these.</p>

<p>But if you’re willing to accept errors above 10m for points offset more than approx 200m you may use a simplified flat earth calculation. I think the errors still will be less than 50m for offsets up to 1km.</p>

<pre><code> //Position, decimal degrees
 lat = 51.0
 lon = 0.0

 //Earth’s radius, sphere
 R=6378137

 //offsets in meters
 dn = 100
 de = 100

 //Coordinate offsets in radians
 dLat = dn/R
 dLon = de/(R*Cos(Pi*lat/180))

 //OffsetPosition, decimal degrees
 latO = lat + dLat * 180/Pi
 lonO = lon + dLon * 180/Pi 
</code></pre>

<p>This should return:</p>

<pre><code> latO = 51,00089832
 lonO = 0,001427437

<p>I find that Aviation Formulary, <a href="http://www.edwilliams.org/avform.htm" rel="noreferrer">here</a> is great for these types of formulas and algorithms. For your problem, check out the "lat/long given radial and distance":<a href="http://www.edwilliams.org/avform.htm#LL" rel="noreferrer">here</a></p>

<p>Note that this algorithm might be a bit too complex for your use, if you want to keep use of trigonometry functions low, etc.</p>

<p>It might make sense to project the point first. You could make something like this pseudo-code:</p>

<pre><code>falt_coordinate = latlon_to_utm(original_koordinate)
new_flat_coordinate = flat_coordinate + (x,y)
result_coordinate = utm_to_latlon(new_flat_coordinate)

<p>where (x,y) is the desired offset.</p>

<p>You don't need to use utm, any flat coordinate system, that makes sense in your area will do.</p>
