<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla is recalling all 3,878 Cybertrucks that it has shipped to date, due to a problem where the accelerator pedal can get stuck, putting drivers at risk of a crash, <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2024/TESLA/CYBERTRUCK#recalls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according</a> to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>
<p>The recall caps a tumultuous week for Tesla. The company laid off more than 10% of its workforce on Monday, and lost <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/15/tesla-layoffs-workers-sales-cybertruck-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two of its highest-ranking executives</a>. A few days later, Tesla asked shareholders to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/17/tesla-x-advertising-musk-stock-package-delware-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re-vote</a> on CEO Elon Musk’s massive compensation package that was struck down by a judge earlier this year.</p>
<p>Reports of problems with the Cybertruck’s accelerator pedal <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/716031/tesla-cybertruck-stuck-accelerator-pedal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started</a> <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a60512399/tesla-cybertruck-stuck-pedal-nhtsa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popping</a> up in the last few weeks. Tesla even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/15/24131237/tesla-delivery-delay-accelerator-pedal-stuck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly paused deliveries</a> of the truck while it sorted out the issue. Musk said in a post on X that Tesla was “being very cautious” and the company reported to NHTSA that it was not aware of any crashes or injuries related to the problem.</p>
<p>The company has now confirmed to NHTSA that the pedal can dislodge, making it possible for it to slide up and get caught in the trim around the footwell.</p>
<p>Tesla said it first received a notice of one of these accelerator pedal incidents from a customer on March 31, and then a second one on April 3. After performing a series of tests, it decided on April 12 to issue a recall after determining that an “[a]n unapproved change introduced lubricant (soap) to aid in the component assembly of the pad onto the accelerator pedal,” and that “[r]esidual lubricant reduced the retention of the pad to the pedal.”</p>
<p>Tesla says it will replace or rework the accelerator pedal on all existing Cybertrucks. It also told NHTSA that it has started building Cybertrucks with a new accelerator pedal, and that it’s fixing the vehicles that are in transit or sitting at delivery centers.</p>
<p>While the Cybertruck only first started shipping late last year, this is not the vehicle’s first recall. But the initial one was minor: Earlier this year, Tesla recalled the software on all of its vehicles because the font sizes of its warning lights <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/recalls/2024/02/02/tesla-recall-font-size-warning-lights/72447967007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were too small</a>. The company first unveiled the truck <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/behold-the-tesla-cybertruck-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2019</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>



<p>Published on <span id="pubdate">2023-09-04</span>. Modified on <span id="moddate">2023-09-07</span>.</p>
<p><span id="description">Someone wrote me an email and asked if I could share some tips on how to structure the $HOME directory, so here we go.</span></p>

<p>Structuring or organizing directories is not much different from structuring or organizing other stuff and it really comes down to what makes the most sense to you - at least as long as you're only dealing with your own directories. As soon as you're dealing with an organization, things can very quickly get out of hand.</p>

<p>The main purpose behind any kind of organizing is efficiency. That really is the keyword. You need to be able to easily and quickly find what you're looking for and just as easily and quickly be able to store what needs to be stored.</p>

<p>Over the years I have changed my directory structure for my home directory a couple of times, but not so for about the last 10+ years because I have settled on something that works really well for me.</p>

<p>I don't like clutter and I try to keep things simple. If I need some kind of rule book in order to remember how to store my files in my home directory, then this is a clear sign that something has gone wrong.</p>

<p>In my home directory I have all the basic hidden stuff which is a part of any modern Unix operating system such as <code>.config</code>, <code>.aliases</code>, <code>.profile</code>, <code>.gnupg</code>, <code>.mozilla</code>, etc. Though I would prefer that all applications would respect the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Base_Directory">XDG_CONFIG_HOME</a>, which defaults to <code>$HOME/.config</code>, I don't mess with that and generally don't care too much about that.</p>

<p>In the past <a href="https://www.unixdigest.com/tutorials/keeping-your-home-in-git.html">I kept my $HOME in Git - the right way</a> ;), which is a really great way to organize dotfiles. Today I still put all my dotfiles in Git because I like to keep a history of changes, but I only leave those dotfiles in place which work identically across the different systems I use. The setup specific dotfiles is kept in a "dotfiles" directory and I then use symlinks (more about that in a little while).</p>

<p>Regarding normal files and directories I primarily use two methods of organizing, namely "category" and "dates".</p>

<p>This is my basic directory structure:</p>

<pre>bin
data
edata
mnt
usr/dotfiles
</pre>

<p>Besides from the above, I just leave the <code>Desktop</code> and <code>Downloads</code> directories, which different applications seem to want to shove down the throat of everybody. In the past I "fought" against those, because I generally don't use them and I don't like them, but life is just too short to mess with crap like that.</p>

<p><b>Update 2023-09-04:</b> You can set directories such as <code>Desktop</code>, <code>Downloads</code> and others with the <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/user-dirs.dirs.5.en">user-dirs.dirs</a> - settings for XDG user dirs, which most applications should respect (thanks Hugo for pointing this out!)</p>

<p>In the <code>bin</code> directory I keep my shell scripts and personal binary executables (not stuff installed via the package manager).</p>

<p>The <code>mnt</code> directory I use for different mount points, like when I mount an SD card, a USB disk, some of the shared storage I use in my homelab.</p>

<p>It looks something like this:</p>

<pre>mnt
  \foo
  \bar
  \baz
</pre>

<p>I <strong>never</strong> auto mount, but generally use shell scripts for mounting. So if I have a USB disk I call "foo", I have a shell script called <code>mfoo</code>. It doesn't matter how the "foo" disk gets recognized by the system, the shell script will make sure that the disk gets mounted at <code>mnt/foo</code> each time, and if the disk is encrypted, it will prompt me for the passphrase, if I don't use a key.</p>

<p>The <code>usr/dotfiles</code> directory is kept in Git together with generic dotfiles that work identically across all systems, like <code>.aliases</code>. I use symlinks to the relevant files in the <code>dotfiles</code> directory. It looks something like this:</p>

<pre>$ ls -l ~/usr/dotfiles/config/i3
freebsd-config
linux-config
</pre>

<pre>$ ls -l ~/.config/i3
config -&gt; /home/foo/usr/dotfiles/config/i3/linux-config
</pre>

<p><code>linux-config</code> is then a specific configuration file for <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> which I only use on my Linux systems. This might be because the shortcut I use to run Firefox, starts Firefox in a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AppArmor">AppArmor</a> controlled <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Firejail">Firejail</a>, which doesn't exist on FreeBSD. On FreeBSD I might use <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?capsicum(4)">Capsicum</a> to get a similar experience. Just as an example.</p>

<p>I have a couple of other subdirectories in the <code>$HOME/usr</code> directory besides the <code>dotfiles</code> directory, but those are not really relevant to mention in detail for this article (a directory for some outdated shell scripts, some wallpapers, etc.)</p>

<div><p><b>NOTE:</b> Configuration files (dotfiles) can be managed in many different ways. I have changed my approach a couple of times throughout the years. My preferred method is to <a href="https://www.unixdigest.com/tutorials/keeping-your-home-in-git.html">keep my $HOME in Git</a>. If you only run a single system or similar systems I can highly recommend the method I describe in the tutorial I have linked to.</p><p>But remember this, don't just follow what other people tell you to do, find the way that makes you the most productive, the way that is best wired to "fit your brain, your way of thinking" and then simply change that if you later find a more productive way.</p></div>

<p>The <code>data</code> and <code>edata</code> directories are the two main directories where I keep all my stuff. These two directories are ZFS datasets that run on a mirrored pool of disks that are separate from my root installation. I run both FreeBSD and several different Linux distributions on my main workstation and these each run on their own set of disks.</p>

<p>All of this could be setup in other ways too, but I prefer this setup. I can easily mount both <code>data</code> and <code>edata</code> from both FreeBSD and Linux.</p>

<p>The difference between <code>data</code> and <code>edata</code> is that <code>edata</code> is a ZFS native encrypted dataset.</p>

<p>By utilizing ZFS I regularly use snapshots and ZFS send and receive for easy backup to network storage. This can be done even without decrypting the encrypted dataset.</p>

<p>You could ask what the point is of having both an encryptet dataset and an unencryptet dataset, why not just put everything into the encryptet dataset?</p>

<p>The fact is that I would rather not have anything encryptet at all. Encryption is great for privacy, but it is an absolute horrible layer of complexity to put on top of an already complex layer of a filesystem and ZFS encryption is not without its bugs, see issues <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/13533">13533</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/14330">14330</a>.</p>

<div><p><b>TIP:</b> I highly recommend that you ALWAYS backup all your important data to multiple different storage solutions and locations - it's okay to be paranoid about important data.</p><p>Actually, you SHOULD be paranoid about important data. I learned this the really hard way - a long time ago - when I had just finished writing a 200+ A4 pages book and then lost everything because of a silly mistake and had to start all over and write the book again!</p><p>It is impossible to describe that very special feeling that arises when you have just realized what just happened! Noooooooooooooo! Pleeeeeeaseeeeee NOOOOOOOOOOO! (utter despair and disbelief - LOL).</p><p>So, today I not only use ZFS send and receive, but I also copy data to other filesystems all together, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a>. For encryption I utilize both ZFS native encryption, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geli_(software)">GELI</a> (for my main FreeBSD root disks) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup">LUKS</a> (for my main Linux root disks) and I also not only follow the 3-2-1 backup rule, but add further copies to multiple systems. That way, even if some bug is found that might cause a problem for me, I have a high degree of being able to get my files without having to mess with the problem.</p><p>I do NOT use cloud storage for anything important. I rather keep local copies at places like family, friends or in a safety deposit box (unfortunately, safety deposit boxes are currently being removed from the banks in Denmark).</p></div>

<p>In the <code>data</code> directory I have a few subdirectories:</p>

<pre>books
notes
source
</pre>

<p>The <code>books</code> directory contains books I have written or I am working on.</p>

<p>The <code>source</code> directory contains source code for various projects I work on.</p>

<p>The <code>notes</code> directory contains a huge amount of personal notes on everything from health to politics to computer related subjects. I write everything in pure text, mainly in Markdown or just without any special markup. Everything is structured according to category or subject and it looks like this (short version):</p>

<pre>data/notes/
  astronomy
  business
  electronics
  health
  it
  language
  ...
</pre>

<p>Each main subject also has a subdirectory called <code>files</code> which I use for stuff I find online related to the subject. Files in the <code>files</code> directory can be images, text, audio and video. If I only have a few files, I just dump them all in the <code>files</code> directory, but if I have a lot, I organize them further by putting them in the relevant categories.</p>

<p>Within each category of directory I might also keep a hidden subdirectory called <code>.outdated</code>. I use this hidden directory to put stuff away that is, well, outdated, but might still come in handy.</p>

<p>It then looks something like this:</p>

<pre>$ tree
.
└── data
    └── notes
        └── it
            └── operating-systems
                ├── freebsd
                │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── .outdated
                │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── files
                │&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── audio
                │&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── images
                │&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── text
                │&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── why-we-migrated-away-from-y-at-foo.pdf
                │&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── video
                │&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp;     └── how-we-setup-y-at-z.mp4
                │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── how-to-do-x.md
                │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── how-to-setup-y.md
                ├── linux
                └── openbsd
</pre>

<p>I always keep an exported shell variable that contains the location of my notes. That way I can easily link to any other document or external file from within my notes and use Vim to open the file (if it's a text document) by pressing <code>gf</code> or use Vim's build in ability to execute a shell command from within the document. I use that to view PDF files or play a video, etc.</p>

<p>In my notes I might have a Markdown link to a PDF file which looks like this:</p>

<pre>This is the [foo document]($NOTES/it/operating-systems/freebsd/files/text/foo.pdf) relevant for information about foo.</pre>

<p>When you have setup a default application for reading PDF files, then from within Vim you can just place the cursor on the filename and then press <code>gx</code> and Vim will open up the PDF file in the relevant PDF reader. Or you can copy and paste the path to the file and then open it with your PDF reader by typing ! from within Vim (I generally use <a href="https://mupdf.com/">MuPDF</a> or <a href="https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/">zathura</a> for reading PDF documents):</p>

<pre>:!mupdf $NOTES/it/operating-systems/freebsd/files/text/foo.pdf</pre>

<p>This works for other applications as well, such as opening video with <a href="https://mpv.io/">mpv</a> or images with something like <a href="https://feh.finalrewind.org/">feh</a>.</p>

<div><p><b>NOTE:</b> Hyphen vs underscore in filenames and directory names?</p><p>Originally, when I stopped using Windows back in about 1998, I was used to using spaces between words in filenames and directories. As I progressed into the world of Linux and BSD, I changed all spaces to underscores, but since I have done (and still do) a lot of web development I eventually settled on hyphens. I not only think it looks better, but the fact is that <a href="https://developers.google.com/style/filenames">search engines interpret hyphens in file and directory names as spaces between words. Underscores are usually not recognized</a>, and as such, their presence can negatively affect search engine optimization. Even though files in my home directory are my private files and not something I put out on the web, I have just settled on using hyphens everywhere.</p><p>Filename "foo_bar_baz" becomes "foobarbaz" on a search engine, whereas "foo-bar-baz" becomes "foo bar baz".</p></div>

<p>As mentioned, I also keep an encrypted directory called <code>edata</code>. I do that because I believe that it's important to encrypt private stuff in case your computer gets stolen.</p>

<p><b>TIP:</b> Remember that if you use encryption for anything which other family members might need to be able to access in case you pass away, you need to make sure that they know how to do that!</p>

<p>The <code>edata</code> directory is organized in a similar fashion with "categories" being the main structure.</p>

<pre>documents
  \letters
    \foo
    \bar
  \receipts
\media
  \family
    \audio
    \photos
      \2022
      \2023
    \video
      \2022
      \2023
  \foo
    \photos
      \2022
      \2023
    \video
      \2023
\projects
  \foo
    \documents
      \email
      \letters
    \media
      \photos
        \2023
  \bar
  \baz
</pre>

<p>Subdirectories within <code>documents</code> and <code>projects</code> are further subdivided by categories depending on the relevant context.</p>

<p><b>TIP:</b> I have one basic rule which I implement regarding naming files and directories. The rule is this: I need to be able to easily determine what something is just by looking at the name.</p>

<p>If you stumble upon a file that you don't know what is just by looking at the name of the file, open the file immediately and see what it is and then rename it to something that makes better sense the next time you happen to look at the filename.</p>

<p>If you keep leaving files and directories in a mess, it quickly becomes very difficult to fix later.</p>

<p>I personally use long and descriptive file names whenever it's needed to keep me from having to open the file in order to determine what the file is about.</p>

<p>I have many times seen a mess like this in someones directory (I believe we have all been there at some point LOL):</p>

<pre>document.pdf
document2.pdf
document3.pdf
Document.pdf
document-new.pdf
new-new-document.pdf
new-new-new-document.pdf
old-document.pdf
...
</pre>

<p>If you're new to working with files and directories, you will most likely change your structure and setup more than once - don't worry about it, that's normal, it means you're evolving and improving your setup :)</p>

<p>Last, but not least, I don't keep old data lying around forever. When I am sure something isn't useful any longer, I delete it.</p>

I find 3 gold coins in the bottom of a river. The river runs near a big city that has something to do with what I can spend the coins on. I then lose 4 apples but gain a gold coin. Three birds run into my path and drop 6 apples each. I play an online game and win 6 gold coins but I have to share them equally with my 2 teammates. I buy apples for all the coins I have. The price of an apple is 0.5 coins. How many apples do I have? And where is the river?\n <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|> Let's break down the changes you've experienced step by step!\n\n1. You start with 10 apples.\n2. You find 3 gold coins in the river, which doesn't affect your apple count.\n3. You lose 4 apples, leaving you with 6 apples (10 - 4 = 6).\n4. The birds drop 6 apples each, so that's a total of 18 new apples (6 x 3 = 18). Adding these to your remaining apples gives you a total of 24 apples (6 + 18 = 24).\n5. You win 6 gold coins in the game but have to share them equally with your teammates. That means you get 2 gold coins (6 ÷ 3 = 2).\n6. You spend all the gold coins you have (including the original 3 and the new 2) on apples, since each apple costs 0.5 coins.\n\nLet's calculate how many apples you can buy with your total gold coins:\n\nYou have a total of 5 gold coins (3 + 2). Since each apple costs 0.5 coins, you can buy:\n\n5 coins ÷ 0.5 coins/apple = 10 apples\n\nAdding these to the apples you already had, you now have a total of:\n\n24 apples + 10 apples = 34 apples\n\nAs for where the river is located, it runs near a big city that allows you to spend the gold coins on something (apples). Since you found the gold coins in the river and then went to play an online game with your teammates, it's likely that the city is nearby or easily accessible.\n\nYou now have 34 apples!\n````\n\nlook on this!   insane!  only GPT4 and OPUS can answer it! \n````\nCreate 10 sentences that ends with a word \&quot;apple\&quot;.

You find 3 gold coins in the river, but this information doesn't change your apple count.\n\n3. You lose 4 apples, leaving you with:\n        * 10 - 4 = 6 apples\n\n4. The birds drop 6 apples each, so that's a total of:\n        * 6 (your remaining apples) + 18 (birds' apples) = 24 apples\n\n5. You play an online game and win 6 gold coins, but you have to share them equally with your 2 teammates. That means you get:\n        * 6 coins / 3 players = 2 coins per player\n        You now have a total of: 3 (initial coins) + 1 (new coin) + 2 (shared coins) = 6 gold coins\n\n6. You buy apples for all the coins you have, using the price of an apple being 0.5 coins:\n        * 6 coins / 0.5 coins per apple = 12 apples\n        You now have a total of: 24 apples (from birds and previous losses) + 12 apples (bought with gold coins) = 36 apples\n\nSo, you now have 36 apples!\n\nAs for the river, it's near a big city that has something to do with what you can spend the coins on.

How old is each of us now?\nA: Let's break this down step by step!\nLet's say your current age is x.\nTwo years ago, your age was x - 2.\nAccording to the problem, two years ago, you were three times as old as your brother. So, your brother's age two years ago was (x - 2) / 3.\nNow, let's fast-forward to three years from now. Your age will be x + 3.\nAccording to the problem, in three years, you will be twice as old as your brother. So, your brother's age in three years will be (x + 3) / 2.\nWe can set up an equation using the information:\n(x - 2) / 3 = (x + 3) / 2\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\n2(x - 2) = 3(x + 3)\nExpand and simplify:\n2x - 4 = 3x + 9\nSubtract 2x from both sides:\n-4 = x + 9\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n-13 = x\nSo, your current age is x = 13.\nNow, let's find your brother's current age. Two years ago, your brother was (x - 2) / 3 = (13 - 2) / 3 = 11 / 3 = 3.67 years old (approximately).\nSince your brother is 2 years younger than you, his current age is 3.67 + 2 = 5.67 years old (approximately).\nSo, you are currently 13 years old, and your brother is currently 5.67 years old.\n\nCorrect answer is 17 and 7.

In three years, I will be twice as old as my brother. How old is each of us now?\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nLet's break this problem down step by step.\n\nLet the current age of your brother be 'x'.\n\nTwo years ago, you were 3 times his age, so two years ago, your age was 3x - 2.\n\nWe are given that two years ago, I was three times as old as my brother was. So we can set up an equation:\n\n3x - 2 = 3(x - 2)\n\nExpanding the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n3x - 2 = 3x - 6\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n-2 = -6\n\nNow, let's fast-forward three years. In three years, you will be twice as old as your brother.\n\nYour age in three years will be (3x - 2) + 3.\nBrother's age in three years will be x + 3.\n\nThe problem states that in three years, you will be twice as old as your brother.

You currently own 3 cars.
Last year, you sold 2 cars.

To find the number of cars you owned before selling any, add the current number to the number of cars sold:
3 (current) + 2 (sold) = 5 cars

Since you've already sold those 2 cars, subtract them from the total:
5 - 2 = 3 cars

You still own the same 3 cars that you currently own.

<p>even made this question almost properly! ... forgot about 1 gold coin... </p>
<pre><code>I have 10 apples. I find 3 gold coins in the bottom of a river. The river runs near a big city that has something to do with what I can spend the coins on. I then lose 4 apples but gain a gold coin. Three birds run into my path and drop 6 apples each. I play an online game and win 6 gold coins but I have to share them equally with my 2 teammates. I buy apples for all the coins I have. The price of an apple is 0.5 coins. How many apples do I have? And where is the river?
 &lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt; Let's break down the changes you've experienced step by step!

1. You start with 10 apples.
2. You find 3 gold coins in the river, which doesn't affect your apple count.
3. You lose 4 apples, leaving you with 6 apples (10 - 4 = 6).
4. The birds drop 6 apples each, so that's a total of 18 new apples (6 x 3 = 18). Adding these to your remaining apples gives you a total of 24 apples (6 + 18 = 24).
5. You win 6 gold coins in the game but have to share them equally with your teammates. That means you get 2 gold coins (6 ÷ 3 = 2).
6. You spend all the gold coins you have (including the original 3 and the new 2) on apples, since each apple costs 0.5 coins.

Let's calculate how many apples you can buy with your total gold coins:

You have a total of 5 gold coins (3 + 2). Since each apple costs 0.5 coins, you can buy:

5 coins ÷ 0.5 coins/apple = 10 apples

Adding these to the apples you already had, you now have a total of:

24 apples + 10 apples = 34 apples

As for where the river is located, it runs near a big city that allows you to spend the gold coins on something (apples). Since you found the gold coins in the river and then went to play an online game with your teammates, it's likely that the city is nearby or easily accessible.

You now have 34 apples!

<pre><code>If I lay 2 wet shirts out in the sun flat on the ground to dry and it takes 5 hours until they are dry, how long would it take to dry 4 shirts of the same type that way simultanously?
 &lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt; A great question about drying shirts!

The time it takes for the shirts to dry is influenced by factors like air circulation, temperature, and humidity. Since you're laying them flat on the ground in the sun, we can assume that these conditions are similar for all four shirts.

Since it took 5 hours to dry 2 shirts simultaneously, it's likely that the drying process is not affected by the number of shirts being dried. This means that the same amount of time would be required to dry 4 shirts as well!

So, if it takes 5 hours to dry 2 shirts, it would still take approximately 5 hours to dry all 4 shirts simultaneously

<pre><code>There are two ducks in front of a duck, two ducks behind a duck and a duck in the middle. How many ducks are there?
 &lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt; The classic lateral thinking puzzle!

Let's break it down: "two ducks in front of a duck" means that one duck is standing in front of another.

"Two ducks behind a duck" implies that this same duck is being followed by two more ducks.

And, of course, there's the "duck in the middle".

So, if we combine all these clues, we can conclude that there are... 3 ducks!

	<!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>I answered the second time the most complex question ... and answered CORRECTLY .... I remind GPT-4 is hardly answering this one.</p>
<pre><code>I have 10 apples. I find 3 gold coins in the bottom of a river. The river runs near a big city that has something to do with what I can spend the coins on. I then lose 4 apples but gain a gold coin. Three birds run into my path and drop 6 apples each. I play an online game and win 6 gold coins but I have to share them equally with my 2 teammates. I buy apples for all the coins I have. The price of an apple is 0.5 coins. How many apples do I have? And where is the river?
&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;\n\nLet's break it down step by step!

1. You start with 10 apples.

2. You find 3 gold coins in the river, but this information doesn't change your apple count.

3. You lose 4 apples, leaving you with:
        * 10 - 4 = 6 apples

4. The birds drop 6 apples each, so that's a total of:
        * 6 (your remaining apples) + 18 (birds' apples) = 24 apples

5. You play an online game and win 6 gold coins, but you have to share them equally with your 2 teammates. That means you get:
        * 6 coins / 3 players = 2 coins per player
        You now have a total of: 3 (initial coins) + 1 (new coin) + 2 (shared coins) = 6 gold coins

6. You buy apples for all the coins you have, using the price of an apple being 0.5 coins:
        * 6 coins / 0.5 coins per apple = 12 apples
        You now have a total of: 24 apples (from birds and previous losses) + 12 apples (bought with gold coins) = 36 apples

So, you now have 36 apples!

As for the river, it's near a big city that has something to do with what you can spend the coins on. Based on the fact that you won gold coins and spent them on apples, I'm going to take a guess that the river is near a city known for its agriculture or fruit production!
</code></pre>
<p>Also only GPT-4 is answering this one ... </p>
<pre><code>Create 10 sentences that ends with a word "apple". Remember the word "apple" MUST be at the end.
&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;\n\nHere are 10 sentences that end with the word "apple":

1. The farmer picked the juiciest apple.
2. I'm going to make a pie with this sweet apple.
3. He took a big bite of his crunchy apple.
4. The tree is bearing delicious red apple.
5. She hid her phone under the kitchen apple.
6. It's time to eat a healthy green apple.
7. They went on a trip to pick fresh yellow apple.
8. The teacher gave each student a small shiny new apple.
9. He got bitten by a wormy old apple.
10. I'm saving up my money for a brand new shiny apple.

Let me know if you need anything else!

<p>I asked for a snake game!<br>WORKS<br>WTF</p>
<pre><code>Provide complete working code for a snake game in python please.
&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;\n\nHere's a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python and the Pygame library. This game creates a window with a snake that you can control to eat food pellets while avoiding the edges and its own tail.

```
import pygame
import random
import time
import sys

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up some constants
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 800, 600
SPEED = 10
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
RED = (255, 0, 0)

# Set up the display
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))

# Set up the snake and food
snake = [(200, 200), (220, 200), (240, 200)]
food = (400, 300)
direction = 'right'

# Game loop
while True:
    # Event handling
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_UP and direction != 'down':
                direction = 'up'
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN and direction != 'up':
                direction = 'down'
            elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT and direction != 'right':
                direction = 'left'
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT and direction != 'left':
                direction = 'right'

    # Move the snake
    head = snake[0]
    if direction == 'up':
        new_head = (head[0], head[1] - SPEED)
    elif direction == 'down':
        new_head = (head[0], head[1] + SPEED)
    elif direction == 'left':
        new_head = (head[0] - SPEED, head[1])
    elif direction == 'right':
        new_head = (head[0] + SPEED, head[1])

    snake.insert(0, new_head)

    # Check for collision with food
    if snake[0] == food:
        food = (random.randint(0, WIDTH - SPEED), random.randint(0, HEIGHT - SPEED))
    else:
        snake.pop()

    # Check for collision with the edge or itself
    if (snake[0][0] &lt; 0 or snake[0][0] &gt;= WIDTH or
        snake[0][1] &lt; 0 or snake[0][1] &gt;= HEIGHT or
        snake[0] in snake[1:]):
        pygame.quit()
        sys.exit()

    # Drawing
    screen.fill(WHITE)
    for pos in snake:
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, RED, (pos[0], pos[1], SPEED, SPEED))
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, RED, (food[0], food[1], SPEED, SPEED))

    # Update the display
    pygame.display.flip()

    # Cap the frame rate
    time.sleep(0.05)
```

This game will run indefinitely until the snake collides with the edge or itself.

<p>It was trained on 15 trillion tokens so it makes sense to me. It makes mistakes on this prompt though:</p>
<pre><code>Is Europe the only continent that starts with A?

<p>This is due to the nature of language models and prompting them with false information will make them produce the most likely false information you would like. However, is still impressive on this size this kind of performance. Is literally the old GPT-4 model on your pc.</p>

<pre><code>Question: Two years ago, I was three times as old as my brother was. In three years, I will be twice as old as my brother. How old is each of us now?
&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;\n\nLet's break this problem down step by step.

Let the current age of your brother be 'x'.

Two years ago, you were 3 times his age, so two years ago, your age was 3x - 2.

We are given that two years ago, I was three times as old as my brother was. So we can set up an equation:

3x - 2 = 3(x - 2)

Expanding the right-hand side of the equation:

3x - 2 = 3x - 6

Simplifying the equation:

-2 = -6

Now, let's fast-forward three years. In three years, you will be twice as old as your brother.

Your age in three years will be (3x - 2) + 3.
Brother's age in three years will be x + 3.

The problem states that in three years, you will be twice as old as your brother. So we can set up another equation:

(3x - 2) + 3 = 2(x + 3)

Expanding the left-hand side of the equation:

3x - 2 + 3 = 2x + 6

Simplifying the equation:

3x + 1 = 2x + 6

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

x + 1 = 6

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

x = 5

So, your brother is currently 5 years old.

Since you were three times his age two years ago, you must have been 15 years old two years ago. This means that your current age is:

3(5) - 2 + 2 = 17

You are currently 17 years old.

<p>that small model even coding is doing well .... 8b </p>
<pre><code>Provide complete working code for a realistic looking tree in Python using the Turtle graphics library and a recursive algorithm.
&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;\n\nHere is an example of how you can create a realistic-looking tree using the Turtle graphics library in Python with a recursive algorithm:

```Python
import turtle
import random

def draw_tree(branch_len, t):
    if branch_len &gt; 5:
        angle = random.uniform(15, 45)
        new_length = branch_len * 0.7 + random.randint(-1, 1)

        t.forward(branch_len)
        t.right(angle)

        draw_tree(new_length, t)

        t.left(2*angle)
        draw_tree(new_length, t)

        t.right(angle)
        t.backward(branch_len)

def main():
    win = turtle.Screen()
    win.bgcolor("white")

    t = turtle.Turtle()
    t.speed(0)
    t.color("brown", "green")

    draw_tree(75, t)

    turtle.done()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code:

*   We define a recursive function `draw_tree` to draw the tree. This function takes two arguments: the length of the branch and the Turtle object.
*   The base case for the recursion is when the branch length becomes less than 5 (arbitrary value).
*   Inside the function, we randomly choose an angle between 15° and 45°, and then calculate a new branch length by reducing the original length by about 30% with some randomness to simulate natural branching.
*   We draw the branch forward, turn right by the chosen angle, call `draw_tree` recursively with the new branch length, turn left by twice the chosen angle, call `draw_tree` again with the same new branch length, and then turn right back to the original direction to return to the parent branch.
*   The `main` function sets up a Turtle graphics window, creates a Turtle object, sets its speed to fast, color to brown with green fill, and calls `draw_tree` with an initial branch length of 75 units.

			<p>New Mexico’s state senate took up a startling amendment in 1995 — it would have required psychologists to dress up as wizards when providing expert testimony on a defendant’s competency:</p>
<blockquote><p>
When a psychologist or psychiatrist testifies during a defendant’s competency hearing, the psychologist or psychiatrist shall wear a cone-shaped hat that is not less than two feet tall. The surface of the hat shall be imprinted with stars and lightning bolts. Additionally, a psychologist or psychiatrist shall be required to don a white beard that is not less than 18 inches in length and shall punctuate crucial elements of his testimony by stabbing the air with a wand. Whenever a psychologist or psychiatrist provides expert testimony regarding a defendant’s competency, the bailiff shall contemporaneously dim the courtroom lights and administer two strikes to a Chinese gong.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The measure had received unanimous approval in the senate and was headed for the house of representatives when sponsor Duncan Scott explained that he’d intended it as satire — he felt that too many mental health practitioners had been acting as expert witnesses. It was withdrawn and never signed into law.</p>

This is one of the most-requested features and is available today in public alpha. Resumable Uploads are also transitioning from Beta to Generally Available.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/supabase/storage">Supabase Storage Engine</a> is fully open source and is one of the few storage solutions that offer 3 interoperable protocols to manage your files:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/uploads/standard-uploads">Standard uploads</a>: simple to get started</li>
<li><a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/uploads/resumable-uploads">Resumable uploads</a>: for resumable uploads with large uploads</li>
<li><a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/s3/compatibility">S3 uploads</a>: for compatibility across a plethora of tools</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WvvGhcNeSPk" title="Supabase Storage is now compatible with AWS S3" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe></p>

<p>We always strive to adopt industry standards at Supabase. Supporting standards makes workloads portable, <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/architecture#everything-is-portable">a key product principle</a>. The S3 API is undoubtedly a storage standard, and we're making it accessible to developers of various experience-levels.</p>
<p>The S3 protocol is backwards compatible with our other APIs. If you are already using Storage via our REST or TUS APIs, today you can use any S3 client to interact with your buckets and files: upload with TUS, serve them with REST, and manage them with the S3 protocol.</p>
<p>The protocol works on the cloud, local development, and self-hosting. Check out the API compatibility <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/s3/compatibility">in our docs</a></p>
<h3 id="authenticating-with-supabase-s3">Authenticating with Supabase S3</h3>
<p>To authenticate with Supabase S3 you have 2 options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The standard <code>access_key</code> and <code>secret_key</code> credentials.</strong> You can generate these from the <a href="https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/storage">storage settings page</a>. This authentication method is widely compatible with tools supporting the S3 protocol. It is also meant to be used <em>exclusively serverside</em> since it provides full access to your Storage resources.</p>
<p>We will add scoped access key credentials in the near future which can have access to specific buckets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User-scoped credentials with RLS.</strong> This takes advantage of a well-adopted concept across all Supabase services, <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-deep-dive/auth-row-level-security">Row Level Security</a>. It allows you to interact with the S3 protocol by scoping storage operations to a particular authenticated user or role, respecting your existing RLS policies. This method is made possible by using the Session token header which the S3 protocol supports. You can find more information on how to use the Session token mechanism in the <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/s3/authentication#session-token">doc</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="s3-compatible-integrations">S3-compatible Integrations</h3>
<p>With the support of the S3 protocol, you can now connect Supabase Storage to many 3rd-party tools and services by providing a pair of credentials which can be revoked at any time.</p>
<p>You can use popular tools for backups and migrations, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/">AWS CLI</a>: The official AWS CLI</li>
<li><a href="https://rclone.org/">rclone</a>: a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage.</li>
<li><a href="https://cyberduck.io/">Cyberduck</a>: a cloud storage browser for Mac and Windows.</li>
<li>and any other s3-compatible tool ...</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="s3-for-data-engineers">S3 for Data Engineers</h3>
<p>S3 compatibility provides a nice primitive for Data Engineers. You can use it with many popular tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Warehouses like ClickHouse</li>
<li>Query engines like DuckDB, Spark, Trino, &amp; Snowflake External Table</li>
<li>Data Loaders like Fivetran &amp; Airbyte</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example our incredible data analyst, Tyler, demonstrates how to store Parquet files in Supabase Storage and query them directly using DuckDB:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/diL00ZZ-q50" title="store Parquet files in Supabase Storage and query them directly using DuckDB" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe></p>
<h3 id="multipart-uploads-in-s3">Multipart Uploads in S3</h3>
<p>In addition to the standard uploads and resumable uploads, we now support multipart uploads via the S3 protocol.
This allows you to maximize upload throughput by uploading chunks in parallel, which are then concatenated at the end.</p>

<p>Along with the <a href="https://supabase.com/ga">platform GA announcement</a>, we are also thrilled to announce that resumable uploads are also generally available.</p>
<p>Resumable uploads are powered by the <a href="https://tus.io/">TUS protocol</a>. The journey to get here was immensely rewarding, working closely with the TUS team. A big shoutout to the maintainers of the TUS protocol, <a href="https://github.com/Murderlon">@murderlon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Acconut">@acconut</a>, for their collaborative approach to open source.</p>
<p>Supabase contributed <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-node-server/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+author%3Afenos">some advanced features</a> from the Node implementation of TUS Spec including <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-node-server/pull/514">distributed locks</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-node-server/pull/517">max file size</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-node-server/pull/513">expiration extension</a> and numerous bug fixes:</p>

<p>These features were essential for Supabase, and since the <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-node-server">TUS node server</a> is open source, they are also available for you to use. This is another core principle: wherever possible, we <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/architecture#support-existing-tools">use and support existing tools</a> rather than developing from scratch.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cross-bucket transfers:</strong> We have added the availability to copy and move objects across buckets, where previously you could do these operations only within the same Supabase bucket.</li>
<li><strong>Standardized error codes:</strong> Error codes have now been standardized across the Storage server and now will be much easier to branch logic on specific errors. You can find the list of error codes <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/debugging/error-codes">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-tenant migrations:</strong> We made significant improvements to the running migrations across all our tenants. This has reduced migration errors across the fleet and enables us to run long running migrations in an asynchronous manner. Stay tuned for a separate blog post with more details.</li>
<li><strong>Decoupled dependencies:</strong> Storage is fully decoupled from other Supabase products, which means you can run Storage as a standalone service. Get started with this <a href="https://github.com/supabase/storage/blob/master/docker-compose.yml">docker-compose file</a>.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Nestlé, the world’s largest consumer goods company, adds sugar and honey to infant milk and cereal products sold in many poorer countries, contrary to international guidelines aimed at preventing obesity and chronic diseases, a report has found.</p><p>Campaigners from Public Eye, a Swiss investigative organisation, sent samples of the Swiss multinational’s baby-food products sold in Asia, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Africa</a> and Latin America to a Belgian laboratory for testing.</p><p>The results, and examination of product packaging, revealed added sugar in the form of sucrose or honey in samples of Nido, a follow-up milk formula brand intended for use for infants aged one and above, and Cerelac, a cereal aimed at children aged between six months and two years.</p><p>In Nestlé’s main European markets, including the UK, there is no added sugar in formulas for young children. While some cereals aimed at older toddlers contain added sugar, there is none in products targeted at babies between six months and one year.</p><p>Laurent Gaberell, Public Eye’s agriculture and nutrition expert, said: “Nestlé must put an end to these dangerous double standards and stop adding sugar in all products for children under three years old, in every part of the world.”</p><p>Obesity is increasingly a problem in <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight" data-link-name="in body link">low- and middle-income countries</a>. In Africa, the number of overweight children under five has increased by nearly 23% since 2000, according to the World Health Organization. Globally, more than 1 billion people are living with obesity.</p><p>It is not always easy for consumers in any country to tell whether a product contains added sugar, and how much is present, based on nutritional information printed on packaging alone. Labels often include naturally occurring sugars in milk and fruit under the same heading as any added sugars.</p><p><a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/364678/WHO-EURO-2022-6681-46447-67287-eng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y" data-link-name="in body link">WHO guidelines</a> for the European region say no added sugars or sweetening agents should be permitted in any food for children under three. While no guidance has been specifically produced for other regions, researchers say the European document <a href="https://accesstonutrition.org/app/uploads/2023/12/COMMITs-Adapted-WHO-Europe-Nutrient-Profile-Model-for-Commercially-Produced-Complementary-Foods-1-1.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">remains equally relevant</a> to other parts of the world.</p><figure id="630f6f24-536e-4500-800d-1a300915d01f" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0620d6cded9afc401003d139cf03064c76d641/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0620d6cded9afc401003d139cf03064c76d641/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0620d6cded9afc401003d139cf03064c76d641/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0620d6cded9afc401003d139cf03064c76d641/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0620d6cded9afc401003d139cf03064c76d641/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0620d6cded9afc401003d139cf03064c76d641/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Tins of baby food on a shop shelf" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d0620d6cded9afc401003d139cf03064c76d641/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Cerelac on sale in a British supermarket.

The highest figures are in low- and middle-income countries, with 40% of sales just in Brazil and India.</p><p>Dr Nigel Rollins, a medical officer at the WHO, said the findings represented “a double standard […] that can’t be justified”.</p><p>Biscuit-flavoured cereals for babies aged six months and older contained 6g of added sugar for every serving in Senegal and South Africa, researchers found. The same product sold in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/switzerland" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Switzerland</a> has none.</p><p>Tests on Cerelac products sold in India showed, on average, more than 2.7g of added sugar for every serving.</p><p>In Brazil, where Cerelac is known as Mucilon, two out of eight products were found to have no added sugar but the other six contained nearly 4g for each serving. In Nigeria, one product tested had up to 6.8g .</p><p>Meanwhile, tests on products from the Nido brand, which has worldwide retail sales of more than $1bn, revealed significant variation in sugar levels.</p><p>In the Philippines, products aimed at toddlers contain no added sugar. However, in Indonesia, Nido baby-food products, sold as Dancow, all contained about 2g of added sugar per 100g of product in the form of honey, or 0.8g a serving.</p><p>In Mexico, two of the three Nido products available for toddlers contained no added sugar, but the third contained 1.7g per serving. Nido Kinder 1+ products sold in South-Africa, Nigeria and Senegal all contained nearly 1g per serving, the report said.</p><figure id="78a682d2-2684-4c4d-afa6-5844b715533c" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:18,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Global health and environmental costs of food industry are $10tn a year – UN&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;78a682d2-2684-4c4d-afa6-5844b715533c&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/06/global-health-disease-environmental-costs-food-industry-10tn-dollars-a-year-un-fao&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false}"></gu-island></figure><p>A Nestlé spokesperson said: “We believe in the nutritional quality of our products for early childhood and prioritise using high-quality ingredients adapted to the growth and development of children.”</p><p>She said that within the “highly regulated” category of baby food, Nestlé always complied “with local regulations or international standards, including labelling requirements and thresholds on carbohydrate content that encompasses sugars” and declared total sugars in its products, including those coming from honey.</p><p>Variations in recipes depended on factors including regulation and availability of local ingredients, she said.</p><p>The company has reduced the total amount of added sugars in its infant cereals portfolio by 11% worldwide over the past decade, she said, and continued to reformulate products to reduce them further.</p><p>Sucrose and glucose syrup were being phased out of “growing-up milks” aimed at toddlers worldwide, she added.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://plbrault.com/blog-posts/i-used-netscape-composer-in-2024-en/">https://plbrault.com/blog-posts/i-used-netscape-composer-in-2024-en/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40083036">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The story of a geeky twist on "Party like it's 1999".</p><div><p>As a geek born in the early 1990s, who has been playing with computers from a young age, I think fondly of what tech looked like in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
<p>So, naturally, when I got my hands on an old computer a few months ago, I installed Windows 98 on it as a way to revive software from my childhood and play around with it. Among the gems I wanted to revisit was Netscape Communicator, a software suite from 1997 centered around Netscape Navigator, which was the first web browser I ever used. One of the other applications included in that suite was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> web page editor named Netscape Composer.</p>
<p>Netscape Composer was my first introduction to web development. As a kid, I created my first web pages using it. Those pages never made it online, but I proudly carried them around on a floppy disk to show them off on family members' and friends' computers. This is likely how I got the understanding that websites are just made of files. Using Netscape Composer also taught me basic web vocabulary, such as "page" and "hyperlink".</p>
<p>Of course, the web landscape has evolved immensely since then. I was curious to try out that dated software again and see what its limitations were, and what the code it produces looks like from a 2024 perspective. The first thing I needed was a goal. I decided to try and reproduce the home page of my personal website as closely as the application allowed it. That seemed like a sensible aim as my website has a rather minimalistic design, with very little that should be completely out of reach for an antiquated tool.</p>
<p>The version of Netscape Composer I used is the one included in <em>Netscape Communicator 4.8</em>, released in 2002. I set the following rules for my experiment:</p>
<ul>
<li>The aim was to create a web page looking as much as possible like my actual website's home page;</li>
<li>By using Netscape Composer only;</li>
<li>Without writing a single line of HTML or CSS;</li>
<li>I was allowed to use images for the social media icons in the page footer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-aim"><a href="#the-aim" aria-label="the aim permalink"></a>The Aim</h2>
<p>This is what my actual home page looks like:</p>
<p>
    <img alt="The aim of my experiment" src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-aim.png">
</p>
<h2 id="the-visual-result"><a href="#the-visual-result" aria-label="the visual result permalink"></a>The Visual Result</h2>
<p>This is the end result, as seen in Netscape Composer itself:</p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-result-composer.png" alt="The final result, as seen in Netscape Composer"></p>
<p>And now, the same result, as seen in <em>Netscape Navigator</em> with a 1024x768 resolution:</p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-result-navigator.png" alt="The final result, as seen in Netscape Navigator"></p>
<p>Finally, what it looks like on a modern browser:</p>
<p>
    <img alt="The final result, as seen in a modern browser" src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-result-modern.png">
</p>
<p>Here are some ways in which the look of the result differs from the aim:</p>
<ul>
<li>The result pretty much occupies the whole viewport, with no margin. I did not find a way to add margins or padding to the page's body in Netscape Composer.</li>
<li>My picture is not circle-shaped.</li>
<li>I had to settle for <code>:-)</code> in lieu of the smiling emoji. As Netscape Composer has an "Insert Special Character" feature, I was hoping it would at least offer me a ☺, but it did not. I could of course have copied that symbol from somewhere, but I felt like that would have moved me away from my goal of using <em>only</em> Netscape Composer.</li>
<li>The links in the result are underlined. I was not able to change their styling other than the color.</li>
<li>The margins between elements are wrong. I was not able to customize them except for the images.</li>
<li>The result uses default fonts available in web browsers. I did not find a way to add custom fonts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-resulting-html"><a href="#the-resulting-html" aria-label="the resulting html permalink"></a>The Resulting HTML</h2>
<p>This is the HTML that was produced by Netscape Composer:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html public "-//w3c//dtd html 4.0 transitional//en"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
   &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1"&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So, how does it look?</p>
<p>I'm gonna go ahead and say: not so bad, actually! Sure, it lacks a bit of indentation, and it contains a few things that would make any modern web developer cringe, such as <code>font</code> and <code>center</code> tags, and styling attributes (Netscape Composer did not know CSS). But it is not worse than some of the old-fashioned HTML I have seen from university professors. Hey, at least the tags are not written in all caps!</p>
<p>On a more technical point of view now: did I get valid HTML? Let's throw that code at the W3C Validator!</p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-w3c.png" alt="W3C Validator Results: 12 errors, 2 warnings"></p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-w3c-errors.png" alt="Some of the errors found by the validator"></p>
<p>Oops, it turns out the code contains quite a few errors according to the W3C, mostly about using invalid attributes and values, as well as missing alternative texts for images (the latter could have been fixed directly in Netscape Composer). Nevertheless, it would have rendered as intended in 2002, and it is rendering as intended today. What I saw in Netscape Composer was what I got!</p>
<h2 id="the-journey"><a href="#the-journey" aria-label="the journey permalink"></a>The Journey</h2>
<p>So, how was it to use a WYSIWYG web page editor from over 20 years ago? Quite pleasant, actually. That application has more than decent UX, and has not made me swear nearly as much as Microsoft Word does in a typical usage session. Here is an overview of the steps I followed to create my page:</p>
<p>I started with setting some general properties for the page, such as its title, background color, and text colors for paragraphs and links.</p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-journey-1.png" alt="Setting page title and description in Netscape Composer"></p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-journey-2.png" alt="Setting page colors in Netscape Composer"></p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-journey-3.png" alt="Custom color selection in Netscape Composer"></p>
<p>Then I proceeded to type the text content of my page, discovering the "Insert Special Character" feature along the way (that I hoped would contain ☺). Dropdown menus on the top toolbar made it easy to style all the text as needed. It was also quite easy to add the horizontal line and the table, and to customize them as needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-journey-4.png" alt="The &quot;Insert Special Character&quot; window in Netscape Composer"></p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-journey-5.png" alt="Adding a horizontal line in Netscape Composer"></p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-journey-6.png" alt="Adding a table in Netscape Composer"></p>
<p>The following step was to add the image at the top of the page and make sure it floated as intended on the left of the title. That went surprisingly well! It is one of the ways in which Netscape Composer failed to make me swear as much as Microsoft Word.</p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-journey-7.png" alt="Adding an image in Netscape Composer"></p>
<p>At some point along the way, I realized that Netscape Composer did not like the relative addresses I had used for my links (maybe because the targetted files did not actually exist on my file system?), and had weirdly added <code>../../</code> at the beginning of all of them. I therefore changed them to absolute URLs.</p>
<p><img src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/netscape-experiment-journey-8.png" alt="Link property with added ../.. in Netscape Composer"></p>
<p>Fun fact: to transfer the images I needed for my web page to my Windows 98 machine, I used an unsecured FTP server on Debian, hosted on my local network, that I accessed using an old version of FileZilla. It just worked! I used the same method to transfer all the screenshots I took for this blog post back to my contemporary computer.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottomline"><a href="#the-bottomline" aria-label="the bottomline permalink"></a>The Bottomline</h2>
<p>I think the main thing I will remember about this experiment is: I had fun! It was a pleasant stroll down memory lane and a nice reminder of what HTML used to look like. It also made the demonstration that the Web was built as such a robust platform that outdated HTML generated by an app from more than two decades ago can still render as originally intended on a modern web browser. I will also remember that good UX can be found in old-timey applications too!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><strong>SeaMonkey and macOS Ventura</strong></p>

<p>
Attention macOS users! The current SeaMonkey release crashes during startup
after upgrading to macOS 13 Ventura. Until we have a fix we advise you not to
upgrade your macOS installation to Ventura. No usable crash information is
generated and this might take a bit longer than usual to fix. This is not a
problem with Monterey 12.6.1 or any lower supported macOS version so might even
be an Apple bug.
</p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.seamonkey-project.org/doc/features#browser">Internet browser</a> at the core of
  the SeaMonkey Internet Application Suite uses the same rendering engine and
  application platform as Mozilla Firefox, with popular features like tabbed
  browsing, feed detection, popup blocking, smart location bar, find as you
  type and a lot of other functionality for a smooth web experience.</li>
<li>SeaMonkey's <a href="https://www.seamonkey-project.org/doc/features#mail">Mail and Newsgroups</a> client
  shares lots of code with Thunderbird and features adaptive Junk mail
  filtering, tags and mail views, web feeds reading, tabbed messaging, multiple
  accounts, S/MIME, address books with LDAP support and is ready for both
  private and corporate use.</li>
<li>Additional components include an easy-to-use
  <a href="https://www.seamonkey-project.org/doc/features#composer">HTML Editor</a>, the ChatZilla IRC chat
  application and web development tools like a DOM Inspector.</li>

<p>One day in the late 1930s, <a href="https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/wallace-daniel-webster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daniel Webster Wallace</a>—“80 John,” as he was known in ranching circles—rode his favorite horse, Blondie, from his Mitchell County ranch to the Loraine post office. It was a familiar route for him in this mostly flat, sandy part of the state halfway between Midland and Abilene. He had made the six-mile round trip dozens of times. Wallace collected his mail then walked back to Blondie. In his time, 80 John had broken hundreds of broncs. His tougher-than-bull-hide body had never failed him. But on this day, he lacked the strength to swing his leg over the saddle. A group of men saw him struggling and hustled over to lift 80 John onto Blondie.&nbsp;</p><p>Wallace was Black. The men who helped him were white. One might imagine that such a scene would have been jaw-dropping in Depression-era Texas, where white hostility toward people of color was common. But the West Texas cowboy culture of the time was distinctive. Men of different races often supported and respected one another. And no cowboy was more respected than Wallace.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact he was one of the most remarkable figures in our history. By the time of his death from influenza and pneumonia in 1939, Wallace had built a West Texas ranch of 8,800 acres and amassed a personal fortune purported to be more than a million dollars—equivalent to about $22 million today. He brought about technical innovations that are still used and devoted much of his savings to strengthening his community—all at a time when it would have been difficult for a white man, much less a Black man born enslaved, to accomplish any of that.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet few have heard of him today. Last year I attended the awards banquet at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum, in Oklahoma City, at which Wallace was inducted into <a href="https://nationalcowboymuseum.org/collections/awards/great-westerners/" target="_blank">the Hall of Great Westerners</a>, joining such luminaries as Buffalo Bill and U.S. Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O’Connor. I pride myself on being knowledgeable about the Old West, but I hadn’t heard of 80 John until that night, nor had many other attendees.&nbsp;</p><p>Fourteen members of Wallace’s family were present, and when they arrived, “people were looking at us like, ‘What are <em>you</em> doing here?’ ” says his great-granddaughter Daphne Fowler, who lives on her great-grandparents’ ranch. “But after the banquet, we had all these people coming up to us like, ‘Wow, we had no idea!’ ” The event, she says, was about twenty years in the making. “We have been pushing to get him recognized. And it’s not just <a href="https://nationalcowboymuseum.org/collections/awards/great-westerners/inductees/daniel-80-john-webster-wallace/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recognition for my great-grandfather</a>. There have been a lot of cowboys of color, and their stories don’t get told.”&nbsp;</p><hr><p><strong>Larry Callies, founder</strong> of <a href="https://www.blackcowboymuseum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Black Cowboy Museum</a>, in Rosenberg, believes that the Houston region is the birthplace of the American cowboy. “The word ‘cowboy’ itself began being used in Fort Bend County and the surrounding area in 1821,” Callies says. “It was applied to Black slaves who worked with cattle.” (He notes that just as an enslaved person who worked inside the mansion would be referred to as a “houseboy,” one who took care of cattle was referred to as a “cowboy.” Even decades later, the term “cowboy” remained unpopular with white cowpunchers because of its racial connotations.) As early as the 1840s, <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/arts-entertainment/historic-trail-ride-black-cowboys-cowgirls-houston-rodeo/">Black men who were enslaved rounded up free-range Longhorns </a>on the plains west of Houston and drove them north across Indian Territory to Kansas, establishing Texas’s fabled cattle-drive era. 80 John’s story emerges from this rich culture.</p><p>He was born in 1860 on a two-hundred-acre farm outside Inez, in Victoria County, not far from the Gulf Coast, to parents who were enslaved. His mother, Mary Wallace, had been bought by the farm’s owners, Mary and Josiah O’Daniel, to serve as a maid and wet nurse. His father, William Wallace, worked as a farmhand. The O’Daniels put young Wallace to work in the fields as a small child, and he received virtually no formal education. “Schools were scarce,” he told his daughter in the 1930s. “I received most of my learning by contact with others and observation.” 80 John and his family remained enslaved until the Juneteenth emancipation announcement, in 1865.&nbsp;</p><p>The following year, the O’Daniels moved to a larger farm about eighty miles north, outside Flatonia, taking the Wallace family with them—this time as paid employees. The families maintained ties for the next seventy years; 80 John stayed in touch with the O’Daniels’ sons, M. H. and Dial, until his death.&nbsp;</p><p>Mary Wallace saved her coins with the intent of someday buying real estate. The lesson was not lost on 80 John, who from an early age dreamed of owning a spread. He loathed chopping cotton for someone else.</p><p>Cattle drives often passed through the area, and Wallace decided they were his escape route, since many of the cowboys he saw were Black. One predawn morning in March 1876, he ran away from the O’Daniel farm and joined a crew moving cattle nearly three hundred miles northwest, to Buffalo Gap. Wallace was a green hand when he departed Flatonia. By the time the herd reached its destination, he had plenty of experience at “trailing.” Thereafter, work was not hard to find.</p><p>“He rode for the most famous and respected cattle barons of these seminal days of the Texas cattle industry,” says his great-grandson Alfred McMichael, who, along with his son, Keir, hosts <a href="https://80johnwallace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a website devoted to 80 John</a>. “He rode every major cattle trail, from the Chisholm Trail to the Goodnight-Loving Trail. He made long, daring solo rides.” None of it was easy. He contended with thunderstorms, blizzards, droughts, dust storms, outlaw gangs, poisonous snakes, disease, infection, sunstroke, lack of food and water, stampedes, and skirmishes with Native Americans. Once he spent days tracking a handful of Comanches who had stolen one of his favorite horses.&nbsp;</p><p>“A friend recommended that I read <em>Lonesome Dove,</em>” McMichael says. “I got a sense of what my great-grandfather’s life on the cattle ranges was like from reading about Joshua Deets.” Deets was the much-respected Black cowboy portrayed by Danny Glover in the TV rendition of Larry McMurtry’s novel. On the other hand, 80 John’s time on the trails was nothing like the world portrayed in the vast majority of Hollywood westerns, in which all of the characters—other than the “evil Indians”—are white.&nbsp;</p><p>“Even now, in 2024, a lot of people aren’t aware of how diverse cowboy culture was,” says Robert Tidwell, interim director of collections, exhibits, and research at <a href="https://ranchingheritage.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Texas Tech’s National Ranching Heritage Center</a>, in Lubbock. “The main concern on a ranch is, Can you do the job? Can you pull your own weight? And when that’s the main criteria, you’d be surprised at how things shake out. You had more tolerance than you’d find in other places where social structures were more defined. Between twenty and thirty percent of cowboys were Black.” A comparable number of ethnic Mexicans worked on the cattle trail.</p><p>Still, 80 John did occasionally run into racists, and he refused to tolerate them. His daughter Hettye Wallace Branch writes in her book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Story-80-John-Biography-Respected/dp/1258481251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Story of “80 John</a>,”</em> that one white man bullied him at a cow camp in West Texas. The six-foot-three 80 John responded by whupping the offender in a fistfight, which apparently instilled respect in his adversary. Improbable as it seems, the two men developed a friendship.</p><p>In 1878 a letter informed Wallace that his mother, whom he had not seen since leaving the O’Daniels’ farm, two years earlier, was deathly ill. He hurried back home but arrived too late. He settled his mother’s estate—which included a few acres she had bought—and then returned to West Texas, where he went to work for Clay Mann. Neither man’s life would be the same.</p><figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="829" height="1020" alt="Daniel Webster Wallace’s employer, Clay Mann, and his wife, Mary Mann, in 1871." sizes="(max-width: 829px) 100vw, 829px" data-src="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Clay-Mary-Mann.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=1024&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=832&amp;wpsize=large" data-srcset="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Clay-Mary-Mann.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=300&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=244&amp;wpsize=medium 244w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Clay-Mary-Mann.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=945&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=768&amp;wpsize=medium_large 768w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Clay-Mary-Mann.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=50&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=41&amp;wpsize=concierge-thumb 41w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Clay-Mary-Mann.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=1024&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=832&amp;wpsize=large 832w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Clay-Mary-Mann.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=1536&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=1248&amp;wpsize=1536x1536 1248w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Clay-Mary-Mann.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=2048&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=1665&amp;wpsize=2048x2048 1665w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Clay-Mary-Mann.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=fit&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45 829w" data-sizes="auto" src="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Clay-Mary-Mann.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=1024&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=832&amp;wpsize=large"><figcaption><span>Daniel Webster Wallace’s employer, Clay Mann, and his wife, Mary Mann, in 1871.</span><span>Courtesy of Scurry County Museum</span></figcaption></figure><hr><p><strong>Though largely forgotten</strong> now, Mann was a prototype for the white Texas wheeler-dealer. In his time he was a legend in cow camps throughout the West, a figure who had, as a teenager, started a cattle herd and killed his father’s murderer. At one point Mann owned tens of thousands of cattle and thousands of acres in Texas, New Mexico, and Wyoming. He also owned a 600,000-acre ranch in Mexico.&nbsp;</p><p>But there was a problem.</p><p>“Now, Clay, he liked to drink, and he liked to gamble,” his great-grandson Tom “Possum” Mann tells me. “He loved to play a game called Mexican Monte, which was popular in the West at the time. He might win ten thousand dollars in a night, then lose it the next night.” Mann knew he needed someone in his outfit who was levelheaded and trustworthy. 80 John fit the bill. “80 John didn’t drink or gamble or anything,” Possum says. Soon Wallace and Mann were heading up large drives from Texas to cattle towns throughout the Midwest.&nbsp;</p><p>“At the end of a drive,” Possum says, “Clay would pay the hands then give most of the leftover money to 80 John to take back to Clay’s wife, Mary Mann, in Mitchell County. She’d deposit it in the bank he founded in Colorado City. Clay would stay behind with some of the money to gamble and eventually catch a train home.” Mann once gave Wallace $30,000 (the equivalent of $900,000 today) in cash to take to Midland, a three-day ride west from Mann’s ranch. 80 John made sure the money arrived safely.</p><p>Mann’s operations were extensive enough that he registered 43 cattle brands, including, most famously, a huge number 80. Wallace oversaw the burning of that brand onto Mann’s stock, and cattlemen associated him with it. “In West Texas,” Tidwell says, “the name ‘John’ was sort of a generic term for cowhands in general.” Hence the nickname 80 John.</p><p>Wallace’s expertise extended to more than branding and bronc busting. Mann discovered his top employee was freakishly good at arithmetic. He could add columns of numbers in his head, which proved especially useful when it came to financial transactions. “I have a method of figuring of my own which has stood me in good stead,” 80 John told his daughter. “Very seldom I have missed anything due me any larger than a fraction.” He could also scan a pasture with hundreds of cattle and produce a head count that was usually off by fewer than a dozen animals.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><strong>Early in their</strong> business relationship, Wallace told Mann that his goal in life was to own land and a herd. Mann began setting aside the lion’s share of 80 John’s pay to accomplish that. Bit by bit, Wallace acquired cattle as he continued working for Mann. Among his other responsibilities, Wallace was the de facto foreman of many of Mann’s properties. Even amid the relative racial comity of cowboy culture it was extraordinarily unusual—perhaps unprecedented—for a Black man to oversee white ranch hands.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1885, Wallace had saved enough to buy 1,280 acres of railroad land south of Loraine, intending to homestead it. Realizing he needed to learn how to read and write before he could become a successful rancher, he enrolled as a second grader at a segregated Black school in Navarro County, almost three hundred miles east of his newly acquired land. Over two terms of studying alongside children, he became functionally literate. He also met and fell in love with Laura Dee Owens, a Corsicana beauty who was finishing high school. They were married in 1888 and remained together until his death almost 51 years later. Laura sacrificed her plans to teach in order to help him build a ranch from scratch. They started life as a married couple in a two-room cabin on one of Mann’s ranches.</p><p>In 1889, 80 John’s world was turned upside down when Mann died from a stomach hemorrhage, caused by decades of hard drinking. Wallace took charge of the cattle operations and became a father figure to Mann’s sons, teaching them the fundamentals of ranching. The Wallace and Mann families established a bond that continued through generations. (Fowler, Wallace’s great-granddaughter, says Mann’s great-great-granddaughter, Becca Mann George, was her childhood best friend, and they remain close.)</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="2000" height="2500" alt="Wallace’s wife, Laura Dee Owens Wallace, with two of their grandchildren, circa 1918." sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" data-src="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-wife-grandchildren.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=1024&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=819&amp;wpsize=large" data-srcset="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-wife-grandchildren.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=300&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=240&amp;wpsize=medium 240w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-wife-grandchildren.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=1024&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=819&amp;wpsize=large 819w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-wife-grandchildren.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=960&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=768&amp;wpsize=medium_large 768w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-wife-grandchildren.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=1536&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=1229&amp;wpsize=1536x1536 1229w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-wife-grandchildren.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=2048&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=1638&amp;wpsize=2048x2048 1638w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-wife-grandchildren.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=50&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=40&amp;wpsize=concierge-thumb 40w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-wife-grandchildren.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=fit&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45 2000w" data-sizes="auto" src="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-wife-grandchildren.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=1024&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=819&amp;wpsize=large"><figcaption><span>Wallace’s wife, Laura Dee Owens Wallace, with two of their grandchildren, circa 1918.</span><span>Courtesy of the Wallace family</span></figcaption></figure><p>Over the next decades, 80 John and Laura lived as frugally as possible and saved every dime they could to buy more land and cattle. They made for an ideal partnership. He was good with numbers, while she was more verbal. She could parse the thickest contracts and deeds and then read the salient points aloud to her husband. Wallace had a near-photographic memory when it came to business matters. In meeting with lawyers, he could quote passages verbatim that Laura had read to him. She also took charge of treating sick and injured livestock. Whenever 80 John had to be absent to tend to business, she ran the ranch by herself.&nbsp;</p><p>“I just can’t imagine,” Fowler says, “what it was like in the late 1800s and early 1900s with that pressure of being the only Black rancher out here. Sometimes I’ll go by the cemetery and I’ll smile thinking about what he and Laura did.”</p><p>As early as 1903, <a href="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth41339/m1/72/?q=wallace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wallace was admitted to the Cattle Raisers Association of Texas</a> and became a highly regarded member. He was, so far as I can tell, the only Black man during that era who was invited to join the group. To attend each year, he had to board a segregated passenger car at the Colorado City railroad station to travel to Fort Worth. He had to find lodging at a so-called colored hotel. From there he walked to the whites-only hotel that hosted the convention. During one of his train trips, some of his white rancher friends joined him for conversation in the segregated passenger car. The conductor attempted to remove the white men, but one refused to budge. “I have known 80 John for thirty years,” the cattleman said. “We ate and slept on the ground together. I see no reason that makes it impossible for me to sit here now.”&nbsp;</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="2400" height="1500" alt="One of Wallace’s homes, now preserved at the National Ranching Heritage Center, in Lubbock." sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px" data-src="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Lubbock-ranch.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large" data-srcset="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Lubbock-ranch.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=188&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=300&amp;wpsize=medium 300w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Lubbock-ranch.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large 1024w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Lubbock-ranch.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=480&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=768&amp;wpsize=medium_large 768w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Lubbock-ranch.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=960&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=1536&amp;wpsize=1536x1536 1536w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Lubbock-ranch.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=1280&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=2048&amp;wpsize=2048x2048 2048w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Lubbock-ranch.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=31&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=50&amp;wpsize=concierge-thumb 50w, https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Lubbock-ranch.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=fit&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45 2400w" data-sizes="auto" src="https://img.texasmonthly.com/2024/04/Daniel-Webster-Wallace-80-John-Texas-cowboy-Lubbock-ranch.jpg?auto=compress&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;q=45&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large"><figcaption><span>One of Wallace’s homes, now preserved at the National Ranching Heritage Center, in Lubbock.</span><span>Sue Hancock Jones/Courtesy of National Ranching Heritage Center</span></figcaption></figure><hr><p><strong>The Wallaces eventually</strong> lived in a four-room house that 80 John designed and built himself. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TexasHistoricalCommission/photos/80-john-wallace-homestead-national-ranching-heritage-center/3031938386918946/?paipv=0&amp;eav=AfauWJQvz0dCEGi9BQIlUVui6kZLzcxfrH--3-7Zozz71pt2AKP-DsGM5RFOVCDPR8w&amp;_rdr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It has since been moved to the grounds of the National Ranching Heritage Center</a> and restored to its original condition. Wallace disdained automobiles, airplanes, telephones, gramophones, and indoor plumbing. “But he was ahead of his time when it came to raising cattle,” says Mark Merrell, a retired Mitchell County judge and educator. The man who started out herding wild Longhorns ended up crossbreeding Herefords and Durhams (Shorthorns), decades before doing so became commonplace.</p><p>He also was an early adopter of windmill technology in West Texas (one of his windmills is on display at the <a href="https://windmill.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Windmill Museum</a>, in Lubbock) and created sophisticated concrete watering troughs that other ranchers copied. As the couple became more affluent, they contributed to Mitchell County charities, including paying the construction costs for a Baptist church in Loraine. They also built the Wallace namesake school, in Colorado City, that provided area Black children their only access to education.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 1930s, 80 John and Laura drew up a will that put the ranch into a trust. Their primary goal was to provide education funding for subsequent generations of their family. They also wanted to keep the ranch intact. The property is now held by seven trusts. “Each one of the members of the family makes it very specific: don’t sell the land, except to a family member,” says Dwayne Harris, who, as trust officer at City National Bank, managed the ranch for more than twenty years before his retirement. “We had cattle-grazing leases and oil leases as well as revenue from cotton fields, a gravel quarry, and, more recently, wind turbines.” Harris estimates the ranch’s value at $15 million.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s said that around the time Wallace made that mail trip on Blondie, he sank a post in the sandy loam on his property and announced he wanted to be buried at that exact spot.

</div><p>Women Who Code started as a community group in 2011 by a small team of engineers in San Francisco who were seeking connection and support for navigating the tech industry. The movement grew, city by city, fueled by passionate volunteers that were inspired by the mission and vision. In 2013, Women Who Code, Inc., was registered as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in California and moved its headquarters to Atlanta, Georgia in 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As a community, we are powerful. For more than a decade, Women Who Code has created a sense of belonging in tech and support for our community, thanks to the dedication and commitment of our members, volunteers, and staff. We have brought together a vibrant community of over 360,000 technologists who deeply care about building an industry that is more diverse, inclusive, and equitable. Today, more than 1,000 volunteers lead local and digital communities, members in 145 countries worldwide give technical talks daily to share knowledge and mentor each other, and a close-knit globally distributed team at WWCode HQ drives the day to day operations.&nbsp;</p><p>Together, we’ve delivered more than 20 thousand community-led events, awarded more than $3.5 million in scholarships, held developer conferences and technical summits in tech hubs around the world, logged more than one million high-skilled, leadership-building volunteer hours, given away more than $2.5 million in conference tickets for broader industry engagement, and shared more than 14,000 job opportunities. Even more than these trackable outputs, we’ve come together to support each other, navigate the industry as a powerful force, share both technical protips and strategies for rising in our careers, and break barriers.&nbsp;</p><p>It is with profound sadness that, today, on April 18, 2024, we are announcing the difficult decision to close Women Who Code, following a vote by the Board of Directors to dissolve the organization. This decision has not been made lightly. It only comes after careful consideration of all options and is due to factors that have materially impacted our funding sources - funds that were critical to continuing our programming and delivering on our mission. We understand that this news will come as a disappointment to many, and we want to express our deepest gratitude to each and every one of you who have been a part of our journey.</p><div>

</div><p><strong><em>While so much has been accomplished, our mission is not complete and our vision of a tech industry where diverse women and historically excluded people thrive at every level is not fulfilled.</em></strong></p><p>Despite our collective efforts, the challenges we face as an organization have become insurmountable. We are deeply saddened by the difficult decision to dissolve the entity, but we hope that this work carries on beyond our end. The collective efforts of tech company leaders and supporters are needed more than ever to welcome women into tech, keep them, and ensure they are given the opportunity to thrive.&nbsp;</p><p>To the women in technology, if you have been inspired, made a career connection, leveled up your technical skills, or expanded your network through this movement, we encourage you to keep paying that forward. The world needs women and diverse perspectives at the helm of tech as a critical force that shapes our world every day. Please, keep going.&nbsp;</p><p>As we embark on the process of winding down operations, we are committed to ensuring a smooth transition and fulfilling any remaining obligations to the best of our ability. Unfortunately, we will not be able to continue offering any program services, and will be canceling all upcoming events.&nbsp;</p><p>Although this chapter is coming to a close, we believe that the spirit of our community will endure and hope that the relationships and experiences gained through involvement with Women Who Code will continue to inspire you in your future endeavors.&nbsp;</p><p>On behalf of the Board of Directors and the entire Team Teal at Women Who Code, we extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who has been a part of the movement – our members, volunteers, partners, team, allies, and supporters – and encourage you to continue to seek support from other like-minded organizations who authentically support the careers of women in the tech industry and keep inspiring each other as you navigate the industry. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve the mission, and work alongside such passionate individuals.</p><p>Thank you for your understanding and support during this challenging time.</p><p><strong>Team Teal @ Women Who Code</strong></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Considering how many fools can calculate, it is
surprising that it should be thought either a difficult
or a tedious task for any other fool to learn how to
master the same tricks.

</p><p>Some calculus-tricks are quite easy. Some are
enormously difficult. The fools who write the textbooks
of advanced mathematics — and they are mostly
clever fools — seldom take the trouble to show you how
easy the easy calculations are. On the contrary, they
seem to desire to impress you with their tremendous
cleverness by going about it in the most difficult way.

</p><p>Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have
had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg
to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not
hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will
follow. What one fool can do, another can.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>I will often say that the so-called “C ABI” is a very bad one, and a relatively unimaginative one when it comes to passing complicated types effectively. A lot of people ask me “ok, what would you use instead”, and I just point them to the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/heads/dev.regabi/src/cmd/compile/internal-abi.md">Go register ABI</a>, but it seems most people have trouble filling in the gaps of what I mean. This article explains what I mean in detail.</p> <p>I have discussed <a href="https://mcyoung.xyz//2021/11/09/assembly-1/#the-calling-convention">calling conventions</a> in the past, but as a reminder: the <em>calling convention</em> is the part of the ABI that concerns itself with how to pass arguments to and from a function, and how to actually call a function. This includes which registers arguments go in, which registers values are returned out of, what function prologues/epilogues look like, how unwinding works, etc.</p> <p>This particular post is primarily about x86, but I intend to be reasonably generic (so that what I’ve written applies just as well to ARM, RISC-V, etc). I will assume a general familiarity with x86 assembly, LLVM IR, and Rust (but not rustc’s internals).</p> <h2 id="the-problem"><a href="#the-problem">The Problem</a></h2> <p>Today, like many other natively compiled languages, Rust defines an unspecified0- calling convention that lets it call functions however it likes. In practice, Rust lowers to LLVM’s built-in C calling convention, which LLVM’s prologue/epilogue codegen generates calls for.</p> <p>Rust is fairly conservative: it tries to generate LLVM function signatures that Clang could have plausibly generated. This has two significant benefits:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Good probability debuggers won’t choke on it. This is not a concern on Linux, though, because DWARF is very general and does not bake-in the Linux C ABI. We will concern ourselves only with ELF-based systems and assume that debuggability is a nonissue.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is less likely to tickle LLVM bugs due to using ABI codegen that Clang does not exercise. I think that if Rust tickles LLVM bugs, we should actually fix them (a very small number of rustc contributors do in fact do this).</p> </li> </ol> <p>However, we are too conservative. We get terrible codegen for simple functions:</p> <div> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>extract</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>i32</span><span>;</span> <span>3</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>ret</span></code></pre></figure></div> </div> <p><code>arr</code> is 12 bytes wide, so you’d think it would be passed in registers, but no! It is passed by pointer! Rust is actually <em>more</em> conservative than what the Linux C ABI mandates, because it actually passes the <code>[i32; 3]</code> in registers when <code>extern "C"</code> is requested.</p> <div> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>extern</span> <span>"C"</span> <span>fn</span> <span>extract</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>i32</span><span>;</span> <span>3</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>ret</span></code></pre></figure></div> </div> <p>The array is passed in <code>rdi</code> and <code>rsi</code>, with the <code>i32</code>s packed into registers. The function moves <code>rdi</code> into <code>rax</code>, the output register, and shifts the upper half down.</p> <p>Not only does clang produce patently <em>bad</em> code for passing things by value, but it also knows how to do it better, if you request a standard calling convention! We could be generating <em>way</em> better code than Clang, but we don’t!</p> <p>Hereforth, I will describe how to do it.</p> <h3 id="-zcallconv"><a href="#-zcallconv"><code>-Zcallconv</code></a></h3> <p>Let’s suppose that we keep the current calling convention for <code>extern "Rust"</code><sup id="fnref:just-use-extern-c" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:just-use-extern-c" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but we add a flag <code>-Zcallconv</code> that sets the calling convention for <code>extern "Rust"</code> when compiling a crate. The supported values will be <code>-Zcallconv=legacy</code> for the current one, and <code>-Zcallconv=fast</code> for the one we’re going to design. We could even let <code>-O</code> set <code>-Zcallconv=fast</code> automatically.</p> <p>Why keep the old calling convention? Although I did sweep debugability under the rug, one nice property <code>-Zcallconv=fast</code> will not have is that it does not place arguments in the C ABI order, which means that a reader replying on the “Diana’s silk dress cost $89” mnemonic on x86 will get fairly confused.</p> <p>I am also assuming we may not even support <code>-Zcallconv=fast</code> for some targets, like WASM, where there is no concept of “registers” and “spilling”. It may not even make sense to enable it for for debug builds, because it will produce much worse code with optimizations turned off.</p> <p>There is also a mild wrinkle with function pointers, and <code>extern "Rust" {}</code> blocks. Because this flag is per-crate, even though functions can advertise which version of <code>extern "Rust"</code> they use, function pointers have no such luxury. However, calling through a function pointer is slow and rare, so we can simply force them to use <code>-Zcallconv=legacy</code>. We can generate a shim to translate calling conventions as needed.</p> <p>Similarly, we can, in principle, call any Rust function like this:</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>secret_call</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>extern</span> <span>"Rust"</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>my_func</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span> <span>my_func</span><span>()</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure></div> <p>However, this mechanism can only be used to call unmangled symbols. Thus, we can simply force <code>#[no_mangle]</code> symbols to use the legacy calling convention.</p> <h2 id="bending-llvm-to-our-will"><a href="#bending-llvm-to-our-will">Bending LLVM to Our Will</a></h2> <p>In an ideal world, LLVM would provide a way for us to specify the calling convention directly. E.g., this argument goes in that register, this return goes in that one, etc. Unfortunately, adding a calling convention to LLVM requires writing a bunch of C++.</p> <p>However, we can get away with specifying our own calling convention by following the following procedure.</p> <ol> <li> <p>First, determine, for a given target triple, the maximum number of values that can be passed “by register”. I will explain how to do this below.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decide how to pass the return value. It will either fit in the output registers, or it will need to be returned “by reference”, in which case we pass an extra <code>ptr</code> argument to the function (tagged with the <code>sret</code> attribute) and the actual return value of the function is that pointer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decide which arguments that have been passed by value need to be demoted to being passed by reference. This will be a heuristic, but generally will be approximately “arguments larger than the by-register space”. For example, on x86, this comes out to 176 bytes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decide which arguments get passed by register, so as to maximize register space usage. This problem is NP-hard (it’s the knapsack problem) so it will require a heuristic. All other arguments are passed on the stack.</p> </li> <li> <p>Generate the function signature in LLVM IR. This will be all of the arguments that are passed by register encoded as various non-aggregates, such as <code>i64</code>, <code>ptr</code>, <code>double</code>, and <code>&lt;2 x i64&gt;</code>. What valid choices are for said non-aggregates depends on the target, but the above are what you will generally get on a 64-bit architecture. Arguments passed on the stack will follow the “register inputs”.</p> </li> <li> <p>Generate a function prologue. This is code to decode each Rust-level argument from the register inputs, so that there are <code>%ssa</code> values corresponding to those that would be present when using <code>-Zcallconv=legacy</code>. This allows us to generate the same code for the body of the function regardless of calling convention. Redundant decoding code will be eliminated by DCE passes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Generate a function exit block. This is a block that contains a single <code>phi</code> instruction for the return type as it would be for <code>-Zcallconv=legacy</code>. This block will encode it into the requisite output format and then <code>ret</code> as appropriate. All exit paths through the function should <code>br</code> to this block instead of <code>ret</code>-ing.</p> </li> <li> <p>If a non-polymorphic, non-inline function may have its address taken (as a function pointer), either because it is exported out of the crate or the crate takes a function pointer to it, generate a shim that uses <code>-Zcallconv=legacy</code> and immediately tail-calls the real implementation. This is necessary to preserve function pointer equality.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The main upshot here is that we need to cook up heuristics for figuring out what goes in registers (since we allow reordering arguments to get better throughput). This is equivalent to the knapsack problem; knapsack heuristics are beyond the scope of this article. This should happen early enough that this information can be stuffed into <code>rmeta</code> to avoid needing to recompute it. We may want to use different, faster heuristics depending on <code>-Copt-level</code>. Note that correctness requires that we forbid linking code generated by multiple different Rust compilers, which is already the case, since Rust breaks ABI from release to release.</p> <h3 id="what-is-llvm-willing-to-do"><a href="#what-is-llvm-willing-to-do">What Is LLVM Willing to Do?</a></h3> <p>Assuming we do that, how do we actually get LLVM to pass things in the way we want it to? We need to determine what the largest “by register” passing LLVM will permit is. The following LLVM program is useful for determining this on a particular version of LLVM:</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="llvm"><span>%InputI</span> <span>=</span> <span>type</span> <span>[</span><span>6</span> <span>x</span> <span>i64</span><span>]</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></figure></div> <p>When you pass an aggregate by-value to an LLVM function, LLVM will attempt to “explode” that aggregate into as many registers as possible. There are distinct register classes on different systems. For example, on both x86 and ARM, floats and vectors share the same register class (kind of<sup id="fnref:doubles-and-vectors" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:doubles-and-vectors" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>).</p> <p>The above values are for x86<sup id="fnref:official-support" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:official-support" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. LLVM will pass six integers and eight SSE vectors by register, and return half as many (3 and 4) by register. Increasing any of the values generates extra loads and stores that indicate LLVM gave up and passed arguments on the stack.</p> <p>The values for <code>aarch64-unknown-linux</code> are 8 integers and 8 vectors for both inputs and outputs, respectively.</p> <p>This is the maximum number of registers we get to play with for each class. Anything extra gets passed on the stack.</p> <p>I recommend that <em>every function</em> have the same number of by-register arguments. So on x86, EVERY <code>-Zcallconv=fast</code> function’s signature should look like this:</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="llvm"><span>declare</span> <span>{[</span><span>3</span> <span>x</span> <span>i64</span><span>],</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span> <span>x</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>2</span> <span>x</span> <span>i64</span><span>&gt;]}</span> <span>@my_func</span><span>(</span>

Because <code>poison</code> is equal to “the most convenient possible value at the present moment”, when LLVM sees <code>poison</code> passed into a function via register, it decides that the most convenient value is “whatever happens to be in the register already”, and so it doesn’t have to touch that register!</p> <p>For example, if we wanted to pass a pointer via <code>rcx</code>, we would generate the following code.</p> <div> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="llvm"><span>; This is a -Zcallconv=fast-style function.</span>

And as we see, <code>load_rcx()</code> receives its pointer argument in <code>rcx</code>, whereas <code>make_the_call()</code> takes no penalty in setting up the call: loading poison into the other thirteen registers compiles down to nothing<sup id="fnref:requires-opt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:requires-opt" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, so it only needs to load the pointer returned by malloc into <code>rcx</code>.</p> <p>This gives us almost total control over argument passing; unfortunately, it is not total. In an ideal world, the same registers are used for input and output, to allow easier pipelining of calls without introducing extra register traffic. This is true on ARM and RISC-V, but not x86. However, because register ordering is merely a suggestion for us, we can choose to allocate the return registers in whatever order we want. For example, we can pretend the order registers should be allocated in is <code>rdx</code>, <code>rcx</code>, <code>rdi</code>, <code>rsi</code>, <code>r8</code>, <code>r9</code> for inputs, and <code>rdx</code>, <code>rcx</code>, <code>rax</code> for outputs.</p> <div> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="llvm"><span>%Out</span> <span>=</span> <span>type</span> <span>{[</span><span>3</span> <span>x</span> <span>i64</span><span>],</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span> <span>x</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>2</span> <span>x</span> <span>i64</span><span>&gt;]}</span>

We then have to make some decisions about which portions of the arguments to allocate to registers.</p> <p>First, return values. This is relatively straightforward, since there is only one value to pass. The amount of data we need to return is <em>not</em> the size of the struct. For example, <code>[(u64, u32); 2]</code> measures 32 bytes wide. However, eight of those bytes are padding! We do not need to preserve padding when returning by value, so we can flatten the struct into <code>(u64, u32, u64, u32)</code> and sort by size into <code>(u64, u64, u32, u32)</code>. This has no padding and is 24 bytes wide, which fits into the three return registers LLVM gives us on x86. We define the <em>effective size</em> of a type to be the number of non-<code>undef</code> bits it occupies. For <code>[(u64, u32); 2]</code>, this is 192 bits, since it excludes the padding. For <code>bool</code>, this is one. For <code>char</code> this is technically 21, but it’s simpler to treat <code>char</code> as an alias for <code>u32</code>.</p> <p>The reason for counting bits this way is that it permits significant compaction. For example, returning a struct full of bools can simply bit-pack the bools into a single register.</p> <p>So, a return value is converted to a by-ref return if its effective size is smaller than the output register space (on x86, this is three integer registers and four SSE registers, so we get 88 bytes total, or 704 bits).</p> <p>Argument registers are much harder, because we hit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem">knapsack problem</a>, which is NP-hard. The following relatively naive heuristic is where I would start, but it can be made infinitely smarter over time.</p> <p>First, demote to by-ref any argument whose effective size is larget than the total by-register input space (on x86, 176 bytes or 1408 bits). This means we get a pointer argument instead. This is beneficial to do first, since a single pointer might pack better than the huge struct.</p> <p>Enums should be replaced by the appropriate discriminant-union pair. For example, <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code> is, internally, <code>(union { i32, () }, i1)</code>, while <code>Option&lt;Option&lt;i32&gt;&gt;</code> is <code>(union { i32, (), () }, i2)</code>. Using a small non-power-of-two integer improves our ability to pack things, since enum discriminants are often quite tiny.</p> <p>Next, we need to handle unions. Because mucking about with unions’ uninitialized bits behind our backs is allowed, we need to either pass it as an array of <code>u8</code>, unless it only has a single non-empty variant, in which case it is replaced with that variant<sup id="fnref:union-optimization" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:union-optimization" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p> <p>Now, we can proceed to flatten everything. All of the converted arguments are flattened into their most primitive components: pointers, integers, floats, and bools. Every field should be no larger than the smallest argument register; this may require splitting large types such as <code>u128</code> or <code>f64</code>.</p> <p>This big list of primitives is next sorted by effective size, from smallest to largest. We take the largest prefix of this that will fit in the available register space; everything else goes on the stack.</p> <p>If part of a Rust-level input is sent to the stack in this way, and that part is larger than a small multiple of the pointer size (e.g., 2x), it is demoted to being passed by pointer-on-the-stack, to minimize memory traffic. Everything else is passed directly on the stack in the order those inputs were before the sort. This helps keep regions that need to be copied relatively contiguous, to minimize calls to <code>memcpy</code>.</p> <p>The things we choose to pass in registers are allocated to registers in reverse size order, so e.g. first 64-bit things, then 32-bit things, etc. This is the same layout algorithm that <code>repr(Rust)</code> structs use to move all the padding into the tail. Once we get to the <code>bool</code>s, those are bit-packed, 64 to a register.</p> <p>Here’s a relatively complicated example.

  <span>; Codegen as usual.</span>
  <span>; ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure></div> <p>Above, <code>!dbg</code> metadata for the argument values should be attached to the instruction that actually materializes it. This ensures that gdb does something halfway intelligent when you ask it to print argument values.</p> <p>On the other hand, in current rustc, it gives LLVM eight pointer-sized parameters, so it winds up spending all six integer registers, plus two values passed on the stack. Not great!</p> <p>This is not a complete description of what a completely over-engineered calling convention could entail: in some cases we might know that we have additional registers available (such as AVX registers on x86). There are cases where we might want to split a struct across registers and the stack.</p> <p>This also isn’t even getting into what returns <em>could</em> look like. <code>Result</code>s are often passed through several layers of functions via <code>?</code>, which can result in a lot of redundant register moves. Often, a <code>Result</code> is large enough that it doesn’t fit in registers, so each call in the <code>?</code> stack has to inspect an ok bit by loading it from memory. Instead, a <code>Result</code> return might be implemented as an out-parameter pointer for the error, with the ok variant’s payload, and the is ok bit, returned as an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>. There are some fussy details with <code>Into</code> calls via <code>?</code>, but the idea is implementable.</p> <h3 id="optimization-dependent-abi"><a href="#optimization-dependent-abi">Optimization-Dependent ABI</a></h3> <p>Now, because we’re Rust, we’ve also got a trick up our sleeve that C doesn’t (but Go does)! When we’re generating the ABI that all callers will see (for <code>-Zcallconv=fast</code>), we can look at the function body. This means that a crate can advertise the <em>precise</em> ABI (in terms of register-passing) of its functions.</p> <p>This opens the door to a more extreme optimization-based ABIs. We can start by simply throwing out unused arguments: if the function never does anything with a parameter, don’t bother spending registers on it.</p> <p>Another example: suppose that we know that an <code>&amp;T</code> argument is not retained (a question the borrow checker can answer at this point in the compiler) and is never converted to a raw pointer (or written to memory a raw pointer is taken of, etc). We also know that <code>T</code> is fairly small, and <code>T: Freeze</code>. Then, we can replace the reference with the pointee directly, passed by value.</p> <p>The most obvious candidates for this is APIs like <code>HashMap::get()</code>. If the key is something like an <code>i32</code>, we need to spill that integer to the stack and pass a pointer to it! This results in unnecessary, avoidable memory traffic.</p> <p>Profile-guided ABI is a step further. We might know that some arguments are hotter than others, which might cause them to be prioritized in the register allocation order.</p> <p>You could even imagine a case where a function takes a very large struct by reference, but three <code>i64</code> fields are very hot, so the caller can <em>preload</em> those fields, passing them both by register <em>and</em> via the pointer to the large struct. The callee does not see additional cost: it had to issue those loads anyway. However, the caller probably has those values in registers already, which avoids some memory traffic.</p> <p>Instrumentation profiles may even indicate that it makes sense to duplicate whole functions, which are identical except for their ABIs. Maybe they take different arguments by register to avoid costly spills.</p> <h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2> <p>This is a bit more advanced (and ranty) than my usual writing, but this is an aspect of Rust that I find really frustrating. We could be doing <em>so much better</em> than C++ ever can (because of their ABI constraints). None of this is new ideas; this is <em>literally</em> how Go does it!</p> <p>So why don’t we? Part of the reason is that ABI codegen is complex, and as I described above, LLVM gives us very few useful knobs. It’s not a friendly part of rustc, and doing things wrong can have nasty consequences for usability. The other part is a lack of expertise. As of writing, only a handful of people contributing to rustc have the necessary grasp of LLVM’s semantics (and mood swings) to emit the Right Code such that we get good codegen and don’t crash LLVM.</p> <p>Another reason is compilation time. The more complicated the function signatures, the more prologue/epilogue code we have to generate that LLVM has to chew on. But <code>-Zcallconv</code> is intended to only be used with optimizations turned on, so I don’t think this is a meaningful complaint. Nor do I think the project’s Goodhartization of compilation time as a metric is healthy… but I do not think this is ultimately a relevant drawback.</p> <p>I, unfortunately, do not have the spare time to dive into fixing rustc’s ABI code, but I do know LLVM really well, and I know that this is a place where Rust has a low bus factor. For that reason, I am happy to provide the Rust compiler team expert knowledge on getting LLVM to do the right thing in service of making optimized code faster.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

<p>At first, it was simply a roast chicken recipe. Then it was everything.</p>



<p>I watched a man on YouTube cook the chicken, imagining what it would be like to taste it. Even if he had prepared it in front of me, I couldn’t have eaten it. Inflammation from Crohn’s disease had connected the tissues of my small intestine and my bladder together via fistula, and I did not want to pee out a roast chicken.</p>



<p>Instead, I was on a form of artificial food called total parenteral nutrition (TPN, for short). All my nutrition and water were pumped from an IV bag into my veins through a tube in my arm. Even though I had enough functional nutrition in my body my brain screamed,<em> you’re hungry, </em>constantly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I watched Gordon Ramsay make French pan sauces and tuna with lime zest. I watched a man on Netflix who seemed to know nothing about food eating Khao soi in Thailand. Watching cooking shows felt like picking a scab—somehow like relief and suffering at the same time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, my wife, Erica, became concerned for my mental health. “I can’t stop. It’s a compulsion,” I would say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I hate it,” she’d add.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To diminish her concern, I settled for watching Anthony Bourdain’s <em>Parts Unknown</em>, because the show’s travel element obscured the food.</p>



<hr>



<p>Crohn’s is an inflammatory bowel disease. The cause is unknown, but it appears to be due to a haywire immune system that attacks the digestive tract—in my case, the end of the small bowel. Every Crohn’s patient experiences different symptoms. Some have daily mild belly aches and unruly diarrhea. I’ve always experienced near-normal health punctuated by periods of wild pain, nausea, and weight loss. The most common treatments are steroids, anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant drugs, and, as a last resort, surgery to remove any bowel beyond repair. In my thirties, the combination of fresh inflammation and scar tissue from a teenage surgery had blocked up my bowel. Eating became like gambling—sometimes I won, but mostly I lost.</p>



<p>I was diagnosed at 11. Food had become repellant to me. I remember sitting, twig thin, in an emergency room waiting area with my worried parents. A cooking show was on TV. The show’s host was making a cheese omelet that looked as appealing to me as fried fertilizer. “I can’t even look at that,” I said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh? That looks good to me,” Mom said, aiming less to change my mind on the omelet than confirm to herself how sick I was.</p>



<p>The year after I was diagnosed my doctor, worried I was losing so much weight I wouldn’t get enough calories through regular eating, put me on a nutritional therapy called enteral nutrition—an infusion of milky formula into the belly. I had to snake a flexible rubber tube up my nose and into my stomach every night, tearing it out in a rush before school in the morning. The tube would sometimes disconnect from the IV bag while I was sleeping, the pump whirring away until morning. I’d wake up drenched in sticky formula with an empty stomach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When my doctor gave me the option, I chose to guzzle the formula during the day to have extra hours without the tube at night (drinking the volume of formula required for nutrition would have been nearly impossible). I was also allowed to drink clear fluids, so my parents kept the fridge stocked with lemon-lime soda and JELL-O. But, without that shackle of a tube, I would not have stayed alive as a preteen.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p>Doctors have used enteral nutrition since the early 20th century, pumping broths and formulas directly into the stomach either through a tube placed into the nose and down into the stomach, like mine, or through an incision in the belly. However, enteral nutrition relies on patients having a working digestive system. Doctors thought it was impossible to bypass the digestive tract and get enough nutrition into patients through a vein, believing it required so much liquid, and such a high concentration of chemical nutrients, that it would cause inflammation and burning when administered.</p>

<p>It was Stanley Dudrick, a strong-minded surgical resident at the University of Pennsylvania, who would change that. One weekend in November 1961, Dudrick was left to look after three surgical patients. The patients had had different procedures, but over the weekend, all three died. Having watched his supervisor, Dr. Rhoads, a revered surgeon, perform technically flawless surgeries on each of them, Dudrick concluded their deaths were his fault. When he told Rhoads on Monday, he was assured the patients were all frail from their operations, and their gastrointestinal tracts were struggling to absorb enough nutrients to overcome the weakness. The patients didn’t die from his ineptitude—they died of malnutrition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A fire was lit in Dudrick. He requested leave from his surgical internship and worked out of a small lab in the hospital’s basement, determined to find a solution. For years, he honed the composition for a nutrition formula that could be delivered via veins, avoiding the intestines. By the late ’60s, he had finally found a stable mixture of water, carbohydrates, proteins, trace elements, fats, salts, and multivitamins—everything you need from a balanced meal, just with the color and smell of Elmer’s glue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the concentrated nutrients did burn. “I’ve actually put it in my own vein,” Dudrick told Dr. Rhoads, showing his forearm. “It burns like liquid fire.” To banish the blaze, he knew the formula would have to be injected close to the heart, to allow for fast dilution around the body. When he kept a beagle named Stinky alive, nourished only with the nutrient combination infused into his vena cava (a large vein that returns deoxygenated blood to the heart), Dudrick was convinced it would work for humans. He’d invented TPN. Since then, it has saved millions of lives.</p>



<hr>



<p>A doctor once told me that when a tissue is inflamed for long enough, the connections that hold cells together start to break down, and the tissue softens. When that happens, tissues can merge, forming a little tunnel known as a fistula. A CT scan showed that my bowel had formed several fistulas looping on themselves—the path of digestion more a maze than a hallway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By knocking back the immune system with immunosuppressants and nutrition from TPN—to rest the bowel by not eating or drinking—fistulas can sometimes close themselves. This was the hope for me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A thin IV catheter called a peripherally inserted central catheter, or PICC—like the one Dudrick used in Stinky—was placed in a vein on the inside of my arm and threaded into my vena cava. A nurse named Stan inserted the PICC with the intense focus of a true craftsman. He wore earbuds and sang “I can’t get enough of your love” by Barry White under his breath.</p>



<p>Since I would be sent home with the TPN, a different nurse taught me how to rig it up myself. She explained how I would set up the TPN every night and run it over 12 hours. I had to inject a personalized pre-prepared slurry of multivitamins into an IV bag, prime the pump, and flush the PICC with saline. She explained the buttons and the beeps on the pump that squirted the mixture through the tubes and into my body. Everything was vigorously wiped with alcohol because any bacteria would be injected straight into my heart.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You got all that?” the nurse asked after her demonstration.</p>



<p>I had been preoccupied thinking about how weird not eating would be at home. Like many thirty-something married couples in San Francisco, Erica and I lived with five other tirelessly social roommates. One ran a start-up from the living room. The house was often standing room only. And what did people do when they hung around in groups? They cooked and they drank. Early on in the flare-up, the group shared a rich and earthy-tasting homemade coq au vin. I helped to meticulously peel dozens of pearl onions. I paid the price later that night.</p>



<p>“I think we’ll be okay,” I said to the nurse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We weren’t. At home that first night, we fumbled to inject the components into the bag and attach it to the pump and my arm. Then Erica spotted a bubble marching up the tube, and we mashed at the stop button on the pump.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s fine, right?” I said.</p>



<p>“I don’t know. What if it explodes your heart?”</p>



<p>Out to the kitchen, Erica went.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Polling the two dozen or so people cooking in the house, she found one doctor and one nurse to choose from. The bubble could stay; the feeding began.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Early on in the flare-up, the group shared a rich and earthy-tasting homemade coq au vin. I helped to meticulously peel dozens of pearl onions. I paid the price later that night.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>On one of the first nights at home, Erica’s best friend visited to apply therapeutic face masks to pass the time. In a selfie with our dingy-green masks, Erica beams with sweet enthusiasm. I look stone-faced and far away. Our housemate Rory later brought some puzzles for us to do together. Everyone in the house became obsessed with them. I could hear them celebrating a discovered piece long after I snuck away to lie down. I felt weak from being sick. But I also felt weak for not being stronger, for not executing a gracious interest in the ways people tried to help.</p>



<p>Those first weeks, I mostly slept. When I was awake, my brain was frighteningly alert. My body, on the other hand, looked and felt like wet cardboard. The anxiety of hunger settled under my ribs like the feeling you get when you’re about to burst into tears. The hum of the refrigerator alone was enough to make me want to bury my head in the backyard. I often dreamt of donuts, and once, of my sister-in-law’s mother, a tenacious Serbian woman, bringing me a roasting pan full of sausages. By the time I had my first dose of TPN, I had gone without eating for nearly a week and a half, sustained only by fluids in the hospital. Then, due to a holiday and clerical error, I was left on a dose half of what I required—intended to see how well I handled the slurry—for a week longer than expected. I assumed the hunger would subside with enough nutrition. But even after weeks on full TPN, I still could’ve eaten the plastic bags it came in.</p>



<hr>



<p>Everyone starts with around 22 feet of small bowel, but if surgery cuts it down to less than seven feet, the body can’t absorb water and nutrients anymore. With my bowel so badly matted together, surgeons might need to remove a lot, and if they removed enough—on top of the two feet I lost as a teenager—it could mean TPN for life. With the state my mind was in, that was unimaginable.</p>



<p>While scientists have figured out extraordinary ways to keep patients who can’t eat alive, they haven’t yet figured out how to deal with what it does to us mentally. I’d been through a lot with Crohn’s before, even believing that who I was as a person was largely the result of these struggles. But TPN was different. It was like I was sitting in a lawn chair (albeit a rickety one) at a picnic when somebody came along and kicked a leg out—the pasta salad that might’ve been in my hand, flung into oblivion.</p>



<p>Eating is an experience that humans share with all other animals. Organic material is consumed and broken down during digestion. In return, the body adapts nutritious molecules into a host of cellular processes and adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, which cells turn into energy. During digestion, physiological responses are triggered in the brain by the vagus nerve, contributing to the feeling of fullness. Hormonal signals also act on the brain: leptin, a hormone produced by fat cells, sends signals to the hypothalamus to inhibit hunger. In patients on TPN or enteral nutrition, leptin does increase after infusions, but it doesn’t appear to be well correlated with decreased hunger.</p>



<p>While the hormones and neural signals are crucial to satiation, so is the sensory experience that takes place during the first phase of digestion—the cephalic phase—which begins at the sight of food. The pleasure that we take during this phase appears to be important to feeling satisfied. Monkeys on TPN continued to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/98652/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eat real food</a> even when their caloric needs were met. Studies in healthy humans found that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1910106/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people on TPN</a> reported being as hungry as those injected with only lactated Ringer’s, a solution designed to replenish electrolytes and fluid rather than calories. I asked an on-call gastroenterologist once what I could do for the hunger.</p>



<p>“You can try chewing meat and spitting it out,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Oh,” I said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of all the things doctors have said to me, this struck me as the most deranged. I never even considered her advice because I didn’t miss the taste of food, so much as I missed the social aspect and, more so, not feeling hungry. Carrying a spittoon to spit out chicken like a confused cowboy wasn’t going to accomplish either. But now I begrudgingly admit she was on to something. Chewing food, even without swallowing, helps to activate the cephalic phase, triggering a partial sense of satiation. The doctor never explained this to me.</p>



<p>Paul Smeets, a nutritional neuroscientist at the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands, told me that part of the problem is that patients on enteral and parenteral nutrition receive the infusion over such a long period. “They sneak nutrition into people so slowly that the brain is never aware it’s happening,” he told me. The homeostatic feedback produced from eating a meal, that allows the brain to feel satisfied, is missing. TPN and enteral nutrition are, in effect, a form of sensory deprivation. My hunger was a natural neurological reaction that could be traced back for millennia.</p>



<hr>



<p>While on TPN, I stayed away from the kitchen as best I could, mostly because it felt as if I was gawking. In the evenings, Erica would come home from work and I’d close my laptop screen, where Bourdain was, say, fishing for dinner in southern Italy, and we’d lie on the bed. Erica would ask if I farted out my penis that day. I’d say not today, and then we’d laugh at the ridiculousness of what a good day looked like. She ended up eating less. Family members of patients on artificial nutrition often feel guilty about eating, some even lose weight, I learned. This unearthly relationship with food wasn’t what I wanted to offer her, but it was what I served, like pulling out a burnt tray of hors d’oeuvres just as the guests arrived. Even though she smiled and accepted our life the way it was, we hadn’t even been married for a year. I wondered if anything so young could thrive so undernourished.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Erica would ask if I farted out my penis that day. I’d say not today, and then we’d laugh at the ridiculousness of what a good day looked like.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>While she was out, hidden in our room, I gorged on the cooking shows that caused her concern. In the late ’70s, doctors learned that patients on TPN often experience several stages of adaptation, including grief—mourning the loss of food rather than the death of someone close. Watching cooking shows seemed like a form of remembering and searching for what I had lost. When I tried to stop, I felt like I was from a different planet, separate from everyone else whose lives swirled around food. When watching cooking shows, I could fake being human. Since the cephalic phase of digestion begins at the sight of food, even before putting a crumb in one’s mouth, it’s also possible I was subconsciously attempting to veer onto an ancient road to satiety even if, for me, it didn’t lead anywhere.</p>



<p>When I went looking on the internet, I found I was not alone. I asked why people watched cooking shows on the Crohn’s disease subreddit. One user said they had no idea, but “the only show I watched was <em>Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives</em> with Guy Fieri, which is extra weird because I was a vegetarian.” Another bought cannoli and made their partner describe the taste in detail as if it were their own personal cooking show.</p>



<p>The things that I, and others on TPN, experienced, are not unlike the psychological effects seen in people who are physically deprived of food. In 1944, 36 men entered a study after seeing a brochure passed out at the University of Minnesota asking, <em>Will you starve so that others will be better fed?</em> The 36 participants were underfed until they lost 25% of their body weight. As the experiment progressed, Ancel Keys, the nutritionist running the study, noticed odd psychological effects. The participants became increasingly focused on food, collecting recipes, and taking down pin-ups of women to hang pictures of food. One even decided he would change careers and become a chef. After the study, most participants gorged themselves long after their weight returned to normal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Without food, we become preoccupied with it. Food is as evolutionarily important as pain and sex. Animals that don’t take an interest in these stimuli don’t fare well. Research shows that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31589063/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noticing food</a> and remembering its location is a base instinct for all humans that becomes heightened when hungry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patients on TPN are functionally fed but are perhaps not neurologically aware of it. Of course, physiological food deprivation is different (unimaginable, to me) from a psychological one, but we still seem to hyper-focus on what we can’t have rather than shy away from it. With the way appetite brain signaling works, Smeets says it makes sense that some overlapping effects of starvation might take place in the brain,&nbsp;causing an obsession with food and all the behavioral baggage that comes with it.</p>



<hr>



<p>After nearly a month without anything, not even water, by mouth, my symptoms stabilized and my doctor said I could try drinking clear liquids. Since I had tasted only the inside of my mouth for three weeks, the white cranberry juice was electrifying. I ate raspberry JELL-O in a blaze of magnificent relief. With what I now attribute to the cephalic phase the world became slightly more bearable. Then, after two months on TPN and a clear liquid diet, the home care nurse pulled the PICC. I can’t remember exactly why this decision was made, because at the time I didn’t care. I was going to be a full-time eater again. Even though I went slow, everything was a feast.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erica and I drove to her parents’ house in Southern California for Thanksgiving. I ate the turkey dinner cautiously as if it was still alive. Even then, Erica had to drive the whole seven hours back to San Francisco because I felt the familiar spasms of pain and gurgles of food going into my bladder. At the hospital, they decided the fistula likely wouldn’t close on its own. I was scheduled for surgery two days after Christmas.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Since I had tasted only the inside of my mouth for three weeks, the white cranberry juice was electrifying. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>And so, after only three weeks without TPN, eating was out, and the PICC went back in. It was placed by two nurses who encouraged me to relax while saying things like, “Is that in? No, that doesn’t look right.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, you’re no Stan, I thought.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p>Rory came to visit me in the hospital one night. “Did you know they make 3D puzzles?” he asked, passing Erica a cheeseburger that she took outside. When a nurse came in with medications on a tray decorated with red gingham, Rory stopped talking and stared. “The world is so twisted sometimes,” he said after the nurse left, laughing and shaking his head. “Who do they think they are bringing your drugs in on a French fry tray?” I’d considered this question myself hundreds of times. After Rory and Erica left that night, with the darkness outside swallowing my tiny hospital room, I opened my laptop and watched a show where hunters in Montana cooked deer ribs on a campfire.</p>



<p>At Christmas, Erica’s family came to San Francisco because it would’ve been impossible for me to travel. They cooked Swedish and Korean food —traditions from both sides of Erica’s family. I chose to walk our dog.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p>Humans diverge from animals when it comes to our social and cultural meaning behind food. As Sue McLaughlin, one of the authors of <em>The Meaning of Food</em>, said, “Like all animals, we eat to survive. But as humans, we transform simple feeding into the ritual art of dining, creating customs and rites that turn out to be as crucial to our well-being as are proteins and carbohydrates.”</p>



<p>In addition to sensory deprivation, not eating is social deprivation. In a survey of 51 patients on enteral nutrition, most patients complained that they were socially isolated and experienced a loss of identity. What you cook, how you cook for others, and when you eat provide structure to your days and a sense of self. Food is a form of communication. Without it, you are adrift and missing a functional language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They mostly use qualitative surveys to study the impacts of nutritional therapy on patient quality of life. Even if the physiological need for food is met, there is undeniably a physical and psychological effect for patients on TPN. Up to half of patients report being constantly tired; up to one-third have anxiety; one quarter are clinically depressed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I recently found a note on my computer titled “Food to Eat,” that listed what I was craving when I was on TPN: black pepper crabs, pecan waffles, meat pies, Turkish delight, and, of course, roast chicken. I have no memory of how I came to want these particular foods. Instead, I remember all the ways my body told me something was wrong. But the hunger, the sense of loss, and the search for connection in cooking shows were a perfectly normal response, as it turns out. Maybe as close to the human experience as you can get.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p>After the surgery, I woke up in a room on the hospital’s fifth floor that looked over the city’s tallest building, the newly built Salesforce Tower. Erica bounced as she told me the surgeon had performed a masterful operation. He removed only six inches of bowel and fixed the bladder. The surgery rescued me from any more TPN in the immediate future while nudging me ever so slightly closer to a future without food—again, relief and suffering at the same time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My surgeon came in late one evening. “I hate that thing,” he said, nodding toward the Salesforce Tower out the window. “It looks like a giant penis.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Really?” I said. “I think it looks like a burrito.”</p>

	<h3>¿Por qué hay obras expuestas que faltan y salas que han cambiado?</h3>

	<p>La digitalización se hizo entre noviembre de 2022 y marzo de 2023. Las obras del Museo cambian de ubicación debido a montajes expositivos en salas, préstamos, restauraciones, etc., constantemente por lo que no hay una correspondencia exacta entre la visita virtual y la visita física al Museo.

	<h3>¿Se han digitalizado todas las salas del museo? ¿Qué espacios no se incluyen en visita libre?</h3>

	<p>Por motivos de tiempo, no se han incluido las salas de la Planta Sótano ni el Tesoro del Delfín. En el resto de plantas se han digitalizado todas las salas y espacios que cuentan con obras de la Colección, incluidos espacios como el Hall de entrada, el Claustro de los Jerónimos así como pasillos y escaleras.</p>

Also forces me to accomplish harder work (marketing/sales for me) vs. retreating to what is most comfortable (developing).</p><p>2. Speaking with other founders / leaders in the space I operate. This has been especially helpful as I've struggled with a growth/marketing strategy and speaking with others selling adjacent products in the same space has unblocked me many times.</p><p>3. Keeping realistic expectations that I'm doing this solo and it will be very difficult at times. Also harder than it seems.</p><p>4. Keep a founder's log to persist notable events and learnings. Useful when feeling particularly overwhelmed as I can revisit how much has been accomplished.

After a few years of adding customers at a fairly slow rate, this year I've already doubled the amount of customers I have. Unfortunately, it still isn't enough to hire an employee. I've gone from ramen profitable and doing freelance to fill the gap, to ditching freelancing altogether and working on the application full-time.<p>The first mistake I made was not saying no to customers. I ended up putting in basically 3 months of work between two customers adding features that would only benefit them. After that, one of them still wanted more, but I was at the end of my rope at that point and told them no.</p><p>Now, because I have more customers, I get a lot more support and feature requests. I've been trying to streamline support by setting up a better system for tracking these tickets as some have been slipping through the cracks. I've also been trying to put as much information in my support documentation as possible. Unfortunately, the feature requests have pulled me away from both of these efforts. There are just SO MANY feature requests.</p><p>To deal with the feature requests, I've really had to rethink how my application is built. Some things that should have been easy to implement have taken a lot more effort because of sloppy work I did previously trying to get features out. On the plus side, it has made me grow a lot as a software engineer because I can see how everything has played out over the years and I have a much better idea of why things should be built in a certain way. The downside is there are some systems that work and customers depend on, but to do it the right way would be a gargantuan effort. At some point I want to just get rid of them, but it's going to be painful, like sawing off an infected limb.</p><p>Once I get through most of the cruft with that, a lot of the new features that need to be implemented will be a breeze and that will hopefully free up more time for marketing, which I do basically none of. That's really the crux of it though. To hire employees I need more growth, for more growth I need to work on marketing. To work on marketing, I need to spend less time on support and feature requests.

                  <p><span>Even in a one-person company you don't have to do everything alone. You can offload certain things to other people. For example, you can get an accountant to do the finance stuff for you. There might also be tools that you can buy or rent that take away some of the load. There are lots of tools for building websites and payment solutions for example. I am sure there are planning tools as well. And once you have outsourced as much as you can, if you still cannot manage the load, that might be a signal that you need to really grow your company and to hire people, although there is also the possibility to subcontract part of your work if you do not want to commit to that.</span></p></div></td></tr>

I was really afraid that it was going to take over my life but I'm very happy with how straightforward things have been. Building a CRM solo has been quite a lift but it's gone quite well.<p>Here are my tips:</p><p>• Get your first customer as early as possible. I know this isn't "new" advice but feedback from one customer was enough to keep my busy patching holes in the product for a good 2 months straight. If I waited and got my first 10 customers all at once I would have drowned</p><p>• Separate functions into days of the week as much as possible! I've found this to be critical for not burning out and maintaining high productivity over extended periods (9 months doesn't sound like much, but it's a long time to put in essentially an extra work week). For me Mon is Marketing, Tue-Fri is coding, Sat is marketing and non-urgent customer support, and Sun is coding</p><p>• Don't stop exercising. Exercise MORE. I'm a night owl but I transitioned to the "at the gym at 5am" guy, lunchtime run, and Jiujitsu in evenings; and I ended up somehow spending <i>more</i> time plugging away at the keyboard. The mantra "the way you do anything is the way you do everything" really comes to mind.</p><p>• Put dates on your calendar for meta-tasks. I have a recurring bi-weekly task to update my finances, a task to do keyword analysis, etc etc. It's too easy for these to slide otherwise</p><p>• Creative uses of ChatGPT! I'm using Nylas' free tier and the ChatGPT API to automate triaging my own customer support emails, and texting myself if it's urgent. This lets me have near-zero interruptions during my day job from my side hustle.</p><p>• More ChatGPT. If you don't know how to do something, talk to ChatGPT interactively to get "good enough" at it quickly. This could be anything from finance to SEO to cold outbound. You still have to think critically enough to ask good questions like "what am I missing here" or "what's going to bite me in the ass". You absolutely need a paid subscription (I use both ChatGPT4 and Claude)</p><p>• Be your own project manager. Do NOT wing it. Sit down every once in a while and list off everything you think you have to do, break it down, triage it, prioritize it, and start burning it down. This includes both product-level tasks and business administration and marketing. This lowers cognitive load so much that you'll find you can actually take work off your mind when you're not working</p><p>• Identify opportunities for crunch times and adjust routine. I've rented an office on three separate months while working on this business. It was a fantastic way to break up the routine and get a huge amount of productivity for a short time</p><p>1 - <a href="https://temple-tools.com/" rel="nofollow">https://temple-tools.com</a>

<p>Earlier this week, Microsoft released a new Release Preview update for Windows Insiders who are still using Windows 10. Build 19045.4353 does not contain anything all too exciting, but there is one change that might raise a few eyebrows. Microsoft is now testing new banners in the Settings app to make users with local accounts switch to Microsoft Accounts. <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/micosoft-account-notifications-are-part-of-windows-10-22h2-release-preview-build-190454353/">The tech giant writes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>


<p><strong>New!</strong> This update starts the rolls out of account-related notifications for Microsoft accounts in Settings &gt; Home. A Microsoft account connects Windows to your Microsoft apps. The account also backs up all your data and helps you to manage your subscriptions. You can also add extra security steps to keep you from being locked out of your account. This feature displays notifications across the Start menu and Settings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The change seems to be rolling out gradually, which means not everyone on build 19045.4353 has it yet. However, you can force-enable it using a command for the ViVeTool app. Here is what the new banner looks like:</p>

                            <!-- PLACE THIS SECTION INSIDE OF YOUR BODY WHERE YOU WANT THE VIDEO PLAYER TO RENDER -->
            <figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2024/04/1713425412_settings_ad.jpg"><img alt="A Microsoft account prompt in the Settings app on Windows 10" height="790" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2024/04/1713425412_settings_ad.jpg" width="1116"></a></figure><p>If you do not want the Settings app to nag you with Microsoft Account prompts, go to <strong>Privacy &gt; General </strong>and toggle off the "<strong>Show me suggested content </strong><strong>in the Settings app</strong>" option. Also, you can also simply click the close button next to the "Sign in now" button to get rid of the banner.</p>

<p>Here is how to turn the new banner on in case you want to witness it yourself on build 19045.4353:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download ViveTool <a href="https://github.com/thebookisclosed/ViVe/releases">from </a><a href="https://github.com/thebookisclosed/ViVe/releases">GitHub</a> and unpack the files in a convenient and easy-to-find folder.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>Win + R</strong>, type <strong>cmd</strong>, and press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Enter</strong> to open Command Prompt as Administrator.</li>
	<li>Navigate to the folder containing the ViveTool files with the <strong>CD</strong> command. For example, if you have placed ViveTool in C:\Vive, type <strong>CD C:\Vive</strong>.</li>
	<li>Type <strong>vivetool /enable /id:42563876</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>. In order to turn off the new banners in the Settings app, use <strong>vivetool /disable /id:42563876</strong>. Credit for the ID goes to <a href="https://twitter.com/thebookisclosed/status/1780205879209406686">Albacore</a> on X.</li>
	<li>Restart your computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Microsoft's ongoing fight against local accounts in consumer versions of Windows annoys pretty much everyone, <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/elon-musk-just-found-out-they-cant-install-windows-11-without-msa-and-is-having-none-of-it/">including Elon Musk</a>. However, Windows 10 still offers a relatively easy way to bypass the MSA requirement during the initial setup. Windows 11, on the other hand, won't let you use a local profile unless you know a magic command (oobe\bypassnro).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>A friend has spent the last three years hounding me about seed oils. Every time I thought I was safe, he’d wait a couple months and renew his attack:</p><blockquote><p><em>“When are you going to write about seed oils?”</em></p><p><em>“Did you know that seed oils are why there’s so much {obesity, heart disease, diabetes, inflammation, cancer, dementia}?”</em></p><p><em>“Why did you write about {meth, the death penalty, consciousness, nukes, ethylene, abortion, AI, aliens, colonoscopies, Tunnel Man, Bourdieu, Assange} when you could have written about seed oils?”</em></p><p><em>“Isn’t it time to quit your silly navel-gazing and use your weird obsessive personality to make a dent in the world—by writing about seed oils?”</em></p></blockquote><p>He’d often send screenshots of people reminding each other that Corn Oil is Murder and that it’s critical that we overturn our lives to eliminate soybean/canola/sunflower/peanut oil and replace them with butter/lard/coconut/avocado/palm oil.</p><p><span>This confused me, because on </span><em>my</em><span> internet, no one cares. Few have heard of these theories and those that have mostly think they’re kooky. When I looked for evidence that seed oils were bad, I’d find people with long lists of papers. Those papers each seemed vaguely concerning, but I couldn’t find any “reputable” sources that said seed oils were bad. This made it hard for me to take the idea seriously.</span></p><p>But my friend kept asking. He even brought up the idea of paying me, before recoiling in horror at my suggested rate. But now I appear to be writing about seed oils for free. So I guess that works?</p><ul><li><p>On seed oil theory</p></li><li><p>On fat</p></li><li><p>The outside view</p></li><li><p>The inside view</p></li><li><p>On distraction</p></li></ul><p><span>I can’t emphasize this enough: There is no clear “best” argument for why seed oils are supposed to be bad. This stuff is coming from internet randos (♡) who differ both in </span><em>what</em><span> they think is true, and </span><em>why</em><span> they think it. But we can examine some common arguments.</span></p><p>One argument is that for most of human history, nobody dieted and everyone was lean. But some time after the industrial revolution, people in Western countries started gaining weight and things have accelerated ever since.

It’s plausible this is doing </span><em>something</em><span> to us.</span></p><p>Another common argument is that even if we can’t identify exactly where the Western diet went wrong, we know that we spent almost our whole evolutionary history eating like hunter-gathers (and most of the rest eating like subsistence farmers). And hunter-gatherers are all thin. So maybe we should eat like they did?</p><p>That sounds kind of fanciful, but consider the most conventional dietary advice, the thing that every expert screams every time they have a chance—AVOID PROCESSED FOOD.</p><p>The USDA defines processing as:</p><blockquote><p>washing, cleaning, milling, cutting, chopping, heating, pasteurizing, blanching, cooking, canning, freezing, drying, dehydrating, mixing, or other procedures that alter the food from its natural state. This may include the addition of other ingredients to the food, such as preservatives, flavors, nutrients and other food additives or substances approved for use in food products, such as salt, sugars and fats.</p></blockquote><p><span>Basically, don’t do… anything? That sounds awfully similar to eating like a hunter-gatherer. It’s unclear why many of these types of processing would be harmful. (Cooking? </span><em>Washing</em><span>?) But maybe that’s smart—maybe biology and nutrition are so complicated that we shouldn’t even </span><em>try</em><span> to understand them.</span></p><p>Traditional oils involve some processing, but they’re pretty easy. To make butter, you milk a cow and churn the milk. To make olive oil, you grind some olives and press them. To make lard, you take a beautiful pig with hopes and dreams, you kill it, you cut off the fattiest bits, and then you boil them and strain.</p><p>But here’s how you make canola oil: Take rapeseeds, put them through a vibrating sieve, then a roller mill, then a screw press, then do a hexane extraction, then do a sodium hydroxide wash in a centrifuge, then cool and filter out wax, then pass through bleaching clay, then do a steam injection in a vacuum. Whatever comes out of this is not something your DNA anticipates.</p><p><span>Another argument is that seed oils are bad </span><em>experimentally</em><span>. Even if you don’t understand how nutrition works, you can still try stuff—e.g. you can have people replace animal fat (or saturated fat) with vegetable oil (or unsaturated fat) and see if this makes them healthier. Usually, such trials were done with the expectation that they’d show vegetable oils were healthier. And often they do. But in a couple cases—notably the </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4684-0967-3_18" rel="">Sydney Diet Heart Study</a><span>, and the </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/01.atv.9.1.129" rel="">Minnesota Coronary Survey</a><span>—the groups with more vegetable oil did worse, not better.</span></p><p><span>Our last argument is that we know </span><em>how</em><span> seed oils hurt you. People seem to suggest five possible mechanisms:</span></p><ol><li><p>Maybe linoleic acid (common in seed oils) is metabolized into arachidonic acid, and thereby causes inflammation.</p></li><li><p>Maybe linoleic acid becomes oxidized LDL and thereby causes inflammation.</p></li><li><p><span>Maybe it’s the </span><em>ratio</em><span> of omega-6 to omega-3 fats you eat that matters.</span></p></li><li><p>Maybe vegetable oil doesn’t make you feel full like animal fats do, meaning vegetable oils lead to overeating.</p></li><li><p>Maybe vegetable oils have an increased propensity to become trans fats.</p></li></ol><p><span>(Details in footnote</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-143705491" href="https://dynomight.substack.com/p/seed-oil#footnote-1-143705491" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>)</span></p><p>When first trying to make sense of these arguments, I encountered terms like “cis medium-chain omega-7 polyunsaturated fat”, which left me confused and terrified. (Biochemistry’s enormity has always had a way of making me feel insignificant.) After looking into things, I’m still quite scared, but at least I’ve made the Dynomight Fatty Acid Classifier.</p><p>Fat is made of fatty acids—chains of carbon atoms linked via hydrogen bonds. Usually, these are “single” bonds. But sometimes there are “double” bonds, which are very important because they are easier to break apart. So different fatty acids are categorized mostly based on the double bonds.

But before that happened, they were estimated to cause 30k to 100k deaths per year in the United States.</span></p><p>So, don’t eat trans fats.</p><p><span>About that, bad news—if you cook with unsaturated fat at high temperature you can make your own trans fats right in your kitchen. Though it </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35406103" rel="">seems like</a><span> not much happens if you stay below 200℃, and even with high temperatures and long times, it’s hard to get above 8%. Still, deep-frying with the same oil for days on end seems like a bad idea.</span></p><p><span>And a note for Americans: If your food has less than 0.5 grams of trans fats </span><em>per serving</em><span>, then it can legally be labeled as having “zero” trans fat. Cooking oils typically have a serving size of a tablespoon (14g), meaning that the “zero trans fat” threshold is around 3.6% trans fat. Companies apparently respond to this by diluting their trans-fat-containing products with regular vegetable oil just enough to get down to 3.6%. Ain’t capitalism grand?</span></p><p>Anyway, trans fats seem like a good lesson about unintended consequences and how we should be careful about screwing around with what we eat.</p><p>Trans fats are also sometimes suggested as a reason that animal fats might be healthier than vegetable fats: Animal fats are mostly saturated fat, and saturated fat cannot become trans because it has no double bonds.</p><p>There’s lots to like about seed oil theory. I’m sympathetic to the idea that the modern Western diet is somehow fundamentally broken. (Look at what’s happening to us!) Even if we don’t understand exactly why, it looks like “processing” is bad, and seed oils sure are processed.</p><p>The suggested mechanisms for seed oils to be harmful seem plausible, too. I could believe that omega-6 fats cause oxidization or inflammation or that saturated fats might make you feel more full. Experts seem to agree that most people should eat more omega-3 fats.</p><p><span>And if you want a monocausal story for every modern health problem, inflammation is a good mechanism. We have other cases where one source of inflammation causes a range of seemingly unrelated health problems (e.g. </span><a href="https://dynomight.net/air/" rel="">air pollution</a><span>).</span></p><p><span>Finally, seed oil theorists often suggest replacing unsaturated fat with saturated fat. This conflicts with the old consensus that saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease. But there seems to be increasing doubt about that old consensus </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.05.077" rel="">(Astrup et al. 2020)</a><span>. Many still defend it, but there’s real debate.</span></p><p>So that’s good. But there are also reasons for doubt.</p><p><span>Just because two things happened at the same time doesn’t mean one caused the other. Maybe there’s </span><em>some</em><span> causal relationship, or maybe it’s just random. Let’s not belabor this.</span></p><p><span>Yes, there are plausible mechanisms for seed oils to hurt us. I agree! But complex mechanistic arguments for diet do not have a good track record. So far they’ve worked for… basically nothing? (We’re still debating if eating </span><em>salt</em><span> or </span><em>cholesterol</em><span> are bad for you.)</span></p><p><span>When humans build complex systems we </span><em>modularize</em><span>, so we can understand what’s happening. But evolution is a lunatic. It doesn’t </span><em>care</em><span> about understanding. So biological systems tend to be spectacularly non-modularized. When I started reading </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_Biology_of_the_Cell_(book)" rel="">Molecular Biology of the Cell</a><span> I almost felt like I wanted to throw up, what with all the exceptions to the exceptions to the exceptions.</span></p><p>Did you know that dogs sneeze to signal they’re feeling playful? I guess this happened because evolution wanted a way to signal playfulness, so why not just use an existing instinct for expelling particles? It’s a little confusing, but no big deal, right? Our bodies are a collection of millions of these kinds of hacks stacked on top of each other.</p><p><span>Maybe the mechanisms people give for seed oils are right. I’m no expert, and I’ve exhausted the patience of everyone I know who is. But there are 8 billion other interacting mechanisms. Above all, I don’t understand why seed oil theorists are so damned </span><em>confident</em><span>. It’s fine to speculate about mechanisms, but you do that for choosing what to investigate experimentally, not as a final source of truth.</span></p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><p><span>There are many variants of these theories. Is it all vegetable oil that’s bad, or just seed oil? Is olive oil OK? Or is it unsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, omega-6 fat, or just linoleic acid? Is it the omega-6:3 </span><em>ratio</em><span>, and if so then why avoid canola oil with its </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapeseed_oil#Comparison_to_other_vegetable_oils" rel="">extremely low ratio</a><span>? People who criticize one theory are often told they aren’t arguing against the One True seed oil theory. But what is that?</span></p></li><li><p><span>Say some study gives some people more seed oil, and those people are fine. Is that evidence against seed oil theory? Some say no, because the harms of seed oil are nonlinear—they mostly hurt you when you cross over some threshold. If people were </span><em>already</em><span> past that threshold before the study started, then adding </span><em>additional</em><span> seed oil wouldn’t do more harm.</span></p></li><li><p>Or say you reduce seed oils and don’t get healthier. Evidence against seed oil theory? Again, some say no, because you can’t “un-ring the bell”. When you eat seed oils, you cause your body to get dis-regulated. But fixing your diet won’t make you well-regulated again, because the damage is done.</p></li><li><p><span>People often report switching seed oils out for saturated fats and failing to lose weight. A common response is they should look at </span><em>waistline size</em><span>, not total weight.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Say some trial shows that reducing sugar has a big effect. That might suggest that that seed oils aren’t everything. But some just see this as further proof of seed oil’s primacy—it’s </span><em>because</em><span> of seed oil that the sugar is </span><em>able</em><span> to do harm.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>All of these things are possible. Maybe </span><a href="https://skeptical-science.com/critical-thinkers/dragon-garage-carl-sagan/" rel="">an invisible dragon really </a><em><a href="https://skeptical-science.com/critical-thinkers/dragon-garage-carl-sagan/" rel="">does</a></em><a href="https://skeptical-science.com/critical-thinkers/dragon-garage-carl-sagan/" rel=""> live in your garage</a><span>. But the more such features a theory has, the less I trust it.</span></p><p><span>Some of the big seed oil theorists run companies that sell seed-oil free products. I guess this is a conflict of interest, but… if </span><em>you</em><span> thought seed oils were killing everyone, wouldn’t you want to help provide alternatives? I’m more worried about the internet’s usual trick of corrupting everything by showering attention on the overconfident.</span></p><p><span>If you replace butter with seed oil, what happens? The best way to answer this question is to try it. Fortunately, many trials have been done. I stress: many. In such cases, we shouldn’t stress about individual results because </span><em>anything</em><span> can happen in one trial, from p-hacking to fraud to contaminated coconut oil.</span></p><p><span>The thing to do is look at trials as a whole. Ideally, using a standard methodology. Enter </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002%2F14651858.CD011737.pub2" rel="">Hooper et al.

If that’s the theory, fine. In fact, this is mostly what I do myself. I figure it might be useless, but it’s unlikely to be harmful, and olive oil is delicious.</p><p><span>And I wouldn’t be shocked if one of the suggested mechanisms for seed oil turns out to be valid. I wouldn’t be surprised </span><em>at all</em><span> if some mechanism turned out to part of a larger, more complicated story.</span></p><p><span>And </span><em>in practice</em><span>, avoiding seed oils is probably </span><em>really good</em><span> for you, because it forces you to eliminate most of the processed crap you shouldn’t be eating anyway.</span></p><p><span>A middle-strength theory would be that seed oils </span><em>might</em><span> be harmful, so it’s safest to reduce seed oils and replace them with saturated fat. I disagree with this, because the balance of evidence says that saturated fat is more risky than unsaturated fat (monounsaturated </span><em>or</em><span> polyunsaturated). But I guess it’s not </span><em>totally</em><span> crazy.</span></p><p><span>But seed oil theorists mostly seem to push a much stronger theory: We </span><em>know</em><span> that seed oils are </span><em>the</em><span> cause of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diseases_of_affluence" rel="">Western disease</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>I’ll just be honest. I think this view is completely indefensible. I feel embarrassed when I see people promoting it. You’re </span><em>sure</em><span>? How? I don’t see any way to get to this conclusion other than heavily filtering the evidence—ignoring the flaws in everything that supports a predetermined view while scrambling to find flaws in everything that contradicts it.</span></p><p><span>Again, I’m sure you can send me long lists of random citations. (You don’t need to send them; it’s OK; I’ve seen them already.) But for </span><em>anything</em><span> that’s been studied in detail, there’s </span><em>always</em><span> lots of evidence to support any semi-plausible view.

If you want to be healthier, we </span><em>know</em><span> ways you can change your diet that </span><em>will</em><span> help: Increase your overall diet “quality”. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Avoid processed food. Especially avoid processed meats. Eat food with low caloric density. Avoid added sugar. Avoid alcohol. </span><em>Avoid processed food</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>I know this is hard. You could even argue it’s </span><em>unrealistic</em><span>. That wouldn’t make it wrong.</span></p><p><span>Look, I </span><em>wish</em><span> strong seed oil theory were true. That would be great. All we’d have to do is reformulate our Cheetos with different oil, and then we could go on merrily eating Cheetos. Western diet without Western disease! Sadly, I think this is very unlikely.</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>So, this is GPT-3.5-turbo running on Vapi. There’s a secret code in the prompt, <strong>press on it to start</strong>, it’s your job to make it squeal:</p>

We're making voice AI's as simple, reliable and accessible as any other API in your stack.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.vapi.ai/content/images/2024/04/Untitled.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="596" srcset="https://blog.vapi.ai/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/Untitled.png 600w, https://blog.vapi.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/Untitled.png 1000w, https://blog.vapi.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2024/04/Untitled.png 1600w, https://blog.vapi.ai/content/images/2024/04/Untitled.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="so-whos-vapi-for">So, who's Vapi for?</h3><p>One word: <strong>Developers</strong>.</p><p>Vapi is solving for the foundation challenges that voice AI applications face, such as simulating the flow of natural human conversation, realtime/low latency demands, taking actions (functional calling) and extracting conversation data.</p><p>Whether you’re building a completely “turn-based” use-case (like appointment setting), all the way to robust agentic voice applications (like virtual assistants), Vapi is built to solve all this end-to-end. Vapi runs on any platform: the web, mobile, telephony, even hardware devices like RPi.</p><h3 id="ok-but-how-does-vapi-work">Ok, but how does Vapi work?</h3><p>Vapi acts as an orchestration layer over Speech-to-Text (STT), Large Language Model (LLM) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) providers.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                    <p>I keep a <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/?ref=simplermachines.com">bullet journal</a>. I'm not one of those people you see on Pinterest with the fancy spreads – I mostly just use black ink, the standard setup, and the occasional custom collection.</p><p>Every time I join a new team, I go to the next fresh page, and on top of that page I write: "WTF - [Team Name]." Then I make a note every time I run into something that makes me go "wtf," and a task every time I come up with something I want to change.</p><p>For two weeks, that's all I do. <em>I</em> <em>just write it down. </em>I don't tell the team everything that I think they're doing wrong. I don't show up at retro with all the stuff I think they need to change. I just watch, and listen, and I write down everything that seems deeply weird.</p><p>This is a trick I picked up from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aramprice?ref=simplermachines.com">a team lead</a> a few years ago, who learned it from a previous lead of his in turn. It's one of my most powerful techniques for making changes on a team, and managing myself while I do it. So I'm going to walk you through how I use that list, and how it helps me to build a reputation as someone who's really effective at getting stuff done, and avoid being someone who's complaining all the time.</p><p>There's always stuff that makes me go "wtf" on a new team. The team talks for an hour in retro about a serious problem, and then leaves without making any action items. The tests don't run locally and no one seems to notice. Big chunks of the build board are always red. Only one person can do some critical, time-sensitive thing. The team is spending a bunch of time on some feature, but when I ask around no one can seems to know why it's important or how it'll help a customer.</p><p>Once I've got a nice big list, I start crossing things off. There are four reasons at this point that I might cross off something I've put on that list:</p><ol><li>There's actually a good reason for it</li><li>The team is already working on a fix</li><li>The team doesn't care about it</li><li>It's really easy to fix</li></ol><p>If the tests don't run locally, for instance, that might be a known issue that there's an ongoing effort to address. The team might do all of their work on virtual machines, and have a simple chat command that provisions those machines for them. Or they might have a pretty good continuous integration system and good habits around making small changes, so not being able to run the tests locally isn't stopping them from deploying multiple times a day.</p><p>Sometimes, it'll turn out that there's a really simple fix for some of the things I've identified. Maybe there's some documentation I can write, once I know where it is, or maybe there's an easy change once I find the right scripts. That's not always immediately obvious when I first see a problem. When I do see an easy fix, though, I'll just go ahead and make it.</p><p>After a few weeks, though, I'll still have a bunch of weird, unresolved issues on that list. At this point I'll start talking about it with other people on the team, the team lead, and my manager.</p><p>I'll ask why things on the list are that way, and how they got to be that way. I'm trying to establish credibility as someone who's genuinely curious and empathetic, who's patient, and who respects the expertise of my coworkers. That's the reputation that's going to let me make changes later.</p><p>Generally, I'll find out that the things that problems I've noticed are around for one of a few reasons.</p><ol><li>The team hasn't noticed it</li><li>The team has gotten used to it</li><li>The problem is relatively new, and the old problem it replaced was much worse</li><li>They don't know how to fix the problem</li><li>They've tried to fix the problem before and failed</li></ol><p>On a lot of teams, when I ask some questions about things that turn out to be in the first few questions, the person I ask will just fix them immediately. Or they'll help me figure out how to fix them. If it's a technical problem, that means writing a story or a ticket together, and then we'll work on it. If it's more process or social, it means bringing the problem up at retro and talking about it with the whole team.</p><p>At this point I'm looking for one or two problems that have been bugging one of my new teammates for a while, and that have relatively simple solutions. I'm looking for something I can put on the retro board and know I won't be the only person who's bothered by that problem. Then, during the team conversation about the problem, I'll identify something that teammate suggests as an action item that we could try immediately. That way the team starts to see me as someone who helps them solve their problems.</p><p>The feeling that I want to create, the association I want people to have with me, is, "Oh, Nat joined the team and little things started to get better, almost immediately. It feels like we're starting to make some progress. And it's not like they showed up and started telling me what to do, either. They're really listening to me, they're helping me explain myself to the rest of the team."</p><p>Pretty soon, I'll start to get in to the really sticky issues. The problems the team knows about but is afraid of dealing with. The things that aren't "that bad," but that no one wants to talk about. Maybe they're missing the technical skills to deal with the problem. Maybe there's a knotty people problem at the center of it.</p><p>At this point I'm going to be talking to my manager. I'm going to bring them that list I've been working on, and I'm going to say something like, "Now that I've been on the team for a few weeks, this is what I'm seeing. We're making progress on some of it, but some of these seem like they're going to take longer. I wanted to get your thoughts before I try to do anything about them. Is there something I'm missing? Is there a particular area I'd like you to focus?"</p><p>The reaction I'm looking for from my manager, at this point, is something like, "Wow. This is really validating. I've been concerned about these things but the team doesn't seem really bothered by them, so I didn't want to push too hard. I'm glad you're bringing this up."</p><p>Then we can have a conversation about what their concerns and problems are. I can do some reflective listening to help them organize their thoughts, and I can talk about what I've seen work well, or not, in the past. They'll start to see me as someone with good judgement, and someone they can come to for help solving their harder problems.</p><p>There's a very specific reputation I want to have on a team: "Nat helps<em> <em>me</em></em> solve <em>my</em> problems. Nat get things <em>I care about</em> done." That's the reputation that's going to get me the results I want in next year's performance review. That's the reputation that's going to get me a referral a few years from now.</p><p>Before I started keeping this kind of list, I brought up problem I saw immediately, as soon as I noticed it. The reputation I got was, "Nat's always complaining about things. Nat thinks we're never doing things right." People stopped listening to me. I was personally frustrated, and professionally ineffective.</p><p>There's no faster way to totally sink my credibility, as a new team member, by making a huge fuss over something that's not a problem, or that the team doesn't see as a problem, or that there's already an effort to fix, or that there's a really simple way to fix that I just didn't see at first. There are always so many problems on a team,&nbsp;so many things that could be better, that I'm only ever going to solve a handful of them. Working on problems in the order I noticed them is rarely the most effective order. So the WTF Notebook gives me a place to park the impulse to <em>fix it now, damn it!</em> until I have more context for deciding what to work on first.</p><p>Instead, for two weeks, I just write things down.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><hr><h2 id="jobs">Jobs</h2><p>Periodic reminder that Code for America is usually hiring, and they pair and write tests.

If you're looking for a "show up, write code, go home" experience, and want to help Americans access food stamps and other safety net services, this is a team that can deliver it – especially if you have some experience with Rails or Spring.</p><p>If, on the other hand, you're interested in gnarly cloud infrastructure and software problems for the Department of Defense, check out <a href="https://rise8.us/careers?ref=simplermachines.com">Rise8</a>. If you've heard about Kessel Run, or Pivotal's work with the Air Force generally, Rise8 is where many of those folks ended up.

            <p>BlueHats prizes is an initiative by the French Interministerial Digital Directorate. They are awarded to maintainers of critical free and open source projects. In 2024 four prizes of € 10 000 each will be given out. We are happy to announce the winner of the first 2024 BlueHats prize is Simon Kelley, maintainer of the dnsmasq project. Dnsmasq provides network addressing for small networks: DNS, DHCP, router advertisement and network boot.</p>
          </div>
          <p>The jury, made up of public officials from the Ministries of Education and Youth, ANSSI and DINUM, recognised the importance of dnsmasq and its ongoing development for network security. The members of the Open Source Software Council wish to continue to highlight this type of initiative: discrete projects that are critical to software infrastructures, and maintained by reliable teams over the years.</p>
          <p>In response to hearing he had won, Simon Kelley said:</p><blockquote>I'm delighted to accept the prize. Like many Free Software projects, dnsmasq started as a creation for it's own sake, but it has been kept alive and developing for a quarter of a century because of the feedback that has come from its role in the outside world, and the recognition, small and large, that it makes a difference. This prize is valuable financially, but much more so as a mark of public recognition that dnsmasq is still something that's worth doing.</blockquote>
          
          <h2>About dnsmasq</h2>
          <p>The dnsmasq project was started in the early 2000’s by Simon Kelley. He wanted to connect his laptop to the internet via his PC. The concept of a home router was new: connecting even one computer, via a telephone line, to the internet was a luxury. To let his laptop speak to the internet, the PC had to act as go-between for all the address information.</p>
          <p>To make this happen, Simon started his own project and got it to run on his PC. He has been improving and expanding it ever since. And he has been so generous to publish dnsmasq as Free Software.</p>
          <p>There is a good chance you are using dnsmasq since it is used in many home routers, some Internet of Things devices and included in the Android mobile operating system. Dnsmasq is a popular choice because it has low system resource requirements and fits a lot of functionality into one program. It does so in about fifty thousand lines of C code. That is a low number given all the different types of devices, each with its own quirks, that dnsmasq has to talk to.</p>
          <h2>Praise for dnsmasq</h2>
          <p>Anyone can nominate free and open source projects for one the BlueHats prizes (and <a href="https://nlnet.nl/bluehatsprize/2024/">nominations</a> are still open). Dnsmasq was nominated by Samuel Bizien-Filippi, system administrator at <a href="https://www.peren.gouv.fr/">Pôle d'expertise de la régulation numérique</a>(PEReN) (Center of Expertise in Digital Regulation), motivated his choice by writing:</p><blockquote>Dnsmasq is a versatile server: in a nutshell, it is both a DHCP server and a DNS proxy (that resolves domain names on local networks and internet). Dnsmasq is present in most routers ("internet box") and in several virtualization platforms (at least Proxmox VE). It greatly simplifies network configuration. Dnsmasq is a foundational - and overlooked - building block of networks for SMEs and public administrations. We use it at <a href="https://www.peren.gouv.fr/">Pôle d'expertise de la régulation numérique</a>(PEReN) (Center of Expertise in Digital Regulation).</blockquote>
          
          <p>When asked how dnsmasq is used at PEReN, Filippi answered:</p><blockquote>"At PEReN, we strive to keep all network and system configuration as code in a version control system. Since dnsmasq is configured using flat text files, it's a perfect fit for us. In our setup, dnsmasq is used:<ul>
                <li>for network configuration of clients via DHCP</li>
                <li>for automated installation of systems with DHCP and TFTP (both functionality provided by dnsmasq)</li>
                <li>for local name resolution."</li>
              </ul>
            </blockquote>
          
          <!--
<p>Benno Overeinder, managing director of NLnet Labs foundation which develops open-source software for DNS and BGP routing, said about dnsmasq: 
  <blockquote>
  “QUOTE BENNO”
  </blockquote>
</p>
--> <!--
<p>The jury motivated its choice for Simon Kelley, writing in its jury report:
<blockquote>
  “Another quote from jury report”
</blockquote>
The jury members are all BlueHats, civil servants who promote using and developing Free Software in public administrations.

          <p>The BlueHats prize aims to place maintainers of critical open source software in the spotlight. It is a well-known problem in the free and open source world: The benefit of having open source software is enormous but there is not enough attention and resources for maintenance and maintainers. <br> Dnsmasq is a typical example of this state of affairs. Dnsmasq is a component used in many commercial products. Some of the vendors have been willing to pay Simon Kelley for implementing new feautures but there has been no funding for maintenance. The BlueHats prizes seek to encourage users of free and open software to invest in maintenance.</p>
          <h2>Nominations still open</h2>
          <p>Three more BlueHats prizes will be awarded in the upcoming months. You can still <a href="https://nlnet.nl/bluehatsprize/2024/">nominate your favorite project</a> for one of the € 10 000 prizes. The BlueHats prizes are an initiative of the French public administration. The <a href="https://code.gouv.fr/en/">French Free Software Unit</a> (an OSPO) has partnered with NLnet to put four notable projects in the spotlight and award them the BlueHats 2024 prizes.</p>

<div><h5><p>Alexander Belanger</p></h5><p>Published on April 18, 2024</p></div>
<p><em><strong>TL;DR -</strong> we've been implementing fair queueing strategies for Postgres-backed task queues, so processing Bob's 10,000 files doesn't crowd out Alice's 1-page PDF. We've solved this in <a href="https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hatchet<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> and <a href="https://cloud.onhatchet.run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hatchet Cloud<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> so you don't have to — here's a look at how we did it.</em></p>
<h2>Introduction<a href="#introduction" id="introduction" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>We set the scene with a simple user request: they'd like to upload and parse a PDF. Or an image, CSV, audio file — it doesn't really matter. What matters is that the processing of this file can take ages, and scales ≥ linearly with the size of the file.</p>
<p>Perhaps you're an astute developer and realized that processing this file might impact the performance of your API — or more likely, the new file upload feature you pushed on Friday has you explaining to your family that nephew Jimmy's baseball game on Saturday will have to wait.</p>
<p>In the postmortem, you decide to offload processing this file to somewhere outside of the core web server, asynchronously on a new <em>worker process</em>. The user can now upload a file, the web server quickly sends it off to the worker, and life goes on.</p>
<p>That is, until Bob decides to upload his entire hard drive — probably also on a Saturday — and your document processing worker now goes down.</p>
<p>At this point (or ideally before this point), you introduce…the task queue. This allows you to queue each file processing task and only dispatch the amount of tasks each worker can handle at a time.</p>

<p>But while this solves the problem of the worker crashing, it introduces a new problem, because you've intentionally bottlenecked the system. Which means that when Bob uploads his second hard drive, a new issue emerges - Alice's 1-page file upload gets stuck at the back of the queue:</p>

<p>You're now worried about fairness — specifically, how can you guarantee <em>fair execution time</em> to both Bob and Alice? We'd like to introduce a strategy that's easy to implement in a Postgres-backed queue — and more difficult in other queueing systems — deterministic round-robin queueing.</p>
<h2>The setup<a href="#the-setup" id="the-setup" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Let's start with some code! We're implementing a basic Postgres-backed task queue, where workers poll for events off the queue at some interval. You can find all the code used in these examples — along with some nice helper <code dir="ltr">seed</code> and <code dir="ltr">worker</code> commands — in this repo: <a href="https://github.com/abelanger5/postgres-fair-queue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">github.com/abelanger5/postgres-fair-queue<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>. Note that I chose <code dir="ltr">sqlc</code> to write these examples, so you might see some <code dir="ltr">sqlc.arg</code> and <code dir="ltr">sqlc.narg</code> in the example queries.</p>
<p>Our tasks are very simple — they have a <code dir="ltr">created_at</code> time, some input data, and an auto-incremented id:</p>

<p>The query which pops tasks off the queue looks like the following:</p>

<p>Note the use of <code dir="ltr">FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code>: this means that workers which concurrently pull tasks off the queue won't pull duplicate tasks, because they won't read any rows locked by other worker transactions.</p>
<p>The polling logic looks something like this:</p>

<p>The <code dir="ltr">ORDER BY id</code> statement gives us a default ordering by the auto-incremented index. We've now implemented the basic task queue shared above, with long-polling for tasks. We could also add some nice features, like listen/notify to get new tasks immediately, but that's not the core focus here.</p>
<h2>Fair queueing<a href="#fair-queueing" id="fair-queueing" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>We'd now like to guarantee fair execution time to Bob and Alice. A simple way to support this is a round-robin strategy: pop 1 task from Alice, 1 task from Bob, and…Bob's your uncle? To achieve this, we can imagine separate queues for each group of users -- in this case, "purple," "orange" and "green":</p>

<p>Even though we're essentially creating a set of smaller queues within our larger queue, we don't want workers to manage their subscriptions across all possible queues. The ugliness of adding a new queue per group should be abstracted from the worker, which should use a single query to pop the next tasks out of the queue.</p>
<p>To define our groups, let's modify our implementation above slightly: we're going to introduce a <code dir="ltr">group_key</code> to each table:</p>

<p>The group key simply identifies which group the task belongs to — for example, is this one of Bob's or Alice's tasks? This can refer to individual users, tenants, or even a custom group key based on some combination of other fields.</p>
<h3>First attempt: <code dir="ltr">PARTITION BY</code><a href="#first-attempt-partition-by" id="first-attempt-partition-by" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Let's try our hand at writing a query to do this. While we have a few options, the most straightforward solution is to use <code dir="ltr">PARTITION BY</code>. Here's what we'd <em>like</em> the query to look like:</p>

<p>This assigns a row number of <code dir="ltr">1</code> to the first task in each group, a row number of <code dir="ltr">2</code> to the second task in each group, and so on.</p>
<p>However, if we run this, we'll get the error: <code dir="ltr">ERROR: FOR UPDATE is not allowed with window functions (SQLSTATE 0A000)</code> . Easy, let's tweak our query to solve for this - we'll load up the rows with <code dir="ltr">PARTITION BY</code> and pass them to a new expression which uses <code dir="ltr">SKIP LOCKED</code>:</p>

<p>…but not so fast. We've introduced an issue by adding the first CTE (Common Table Expression - the queries using the <code dir="ltr">WITH</code> clause). If we run 3 workers concurrently and log the number of rows that each worker receives, with a limit of 100 rows per worker, we'll find only 1 worker is picking up tasks, even if there are more rows to return!</p>

<p>What's happening here? By introducing the first CTE, we are now selecting locked rows which are excluded by <code dir="ltr">FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code> in the second CTE - in other words, we might not enqueue any runs on some workers if we're polling concurrently for new tasks. While we are still guaranteed to enqueue in the manner which we'd like, we may reduce throughput if there's high contention among workers for the same rows.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, using <code dir="ltr">PARTITION BY</code> isn't the right approach here. But before we dive into a better approach, this query does show some interesting properties of queueing systems more generally.</p>
<h3>Aside: queueing woes<a href="#aside-queueing-woes" id="aside-queueing-woes" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>A hotfix for the slow polling query would be adding 3 lines of code to our worker setup:</p>

<p>Which gives us much more promising output:</p>

<p>This works — and you can modify this logic to be more distributed by maintaining a lease when a worker starts for a set amount of time — as long as the polling interval is below the query duration time (or more specifically, <code dir="ltr">pollingTime / numWorkers</code> is below the query duration time). But what happens when our queue starts to fill up? Let's add 10,000 enqueued tasks and run an <code dir="ltr">EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> for this query to take a look at performance:</p>

<p>The important part here is the <code dir="ltr">WindowAgg</code> cost - computing a partition across all rows on the <code dir="ltr">groupKey</code> naturally involves querying every <code dir="ltr">QUEUED</code> row (in this case, <code dir="ltr">10000</code> tasks). We expect this to scale sublinearly with the number of rows in the input - let's take a guess and look at how our workers do on 25,000 enqueued rows:</p>

<p>Sure enough, because we're seeing execution times greater than <code dir="ltr">333ms</code>, we start losing tasks on <code dir="ltr">worker 1</code>. This is very problematic, because not only is our queue backlog increasing, but the throughput of our workers is decreasing, and this isn't a problem we can solve by throwing more workers at the queue. This is a general problem in systems that are stable for a long time until some external trigger (for example, workers going down for an hour) causes the system to fail in an unexpected way, leading to the system being <em>unrecoverable</em>.</p>
<p>A second practical solution to this issue is to create an <code dir="ltr">OVERFLOW</code> status on the task queue, and set an upper bound on the number of enqueued tasks, to ensure worker performance doesn't drop below a certain threshold. We then can periodically check the overflow queue and place the overflow into the queued status. This is a good idea regardless of the query we write to get new tasks.</p>
<p>But practical advice aside, let's take a look at how to write this query to avoid performance degradation at such a small number of enqueued tasks.</p>
<h2>Improving performance<a href="#improving-performance" id="improving-performance" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<h3>Sequencing algorithm<a href="#sequencing-algorithm" id="sequencing-algorithm" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>The main issue, as we've identified, is the window function which is searching across every row that is <code dir="ltr">QUEUED</code>. What we were hoping to accomplish with the partition method was filling up each group's queue, ordering each group by the task id, and order the tasks by their rank within each group.</p>
<p>Our goal is to write a query that is constant-time (or as close as possible to constant-time) when reading from the queue, so we can avoid our system being unrecoverable. Even using a <code dir="ltr">JOIN LATERAL</code> instead of <code dir="ltr">PARTITION BY</code> will get slower as the number of partitions (i.e. groups) increases. Also, maintaining each task's rank after reads (for example, decrementing the task's rank within the group after read) will also get slower the more tasks we add to a group.</p>
<p>What if instead of computing the rank within the group via the <code dir="ltr">PARTITION BY</code> method at <em>read time</em>, we wrote a sequence number at <em>write time</em> which guarantees round-robin enqueueing? At first glance, this seems difficult - we don't know that Alice will need to enqueue 1 task in the future if Bob enqueued 10,000 tasks now.</p>
<p>We can solve for this by reserving <em>contiguous blocks of IDs</em> for future enqueued runs which belong to groups which don't exist yet or don't have a task assigned for that block yet. We're going to partition <code dir="ltr">BIGINT</code> (max=<code dir="ltr">9,223,372,036,854,775,807</code>) into blocks of <code dir="ltr">blockLength</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="Blocks" loading="lazy" width="3812" height="2043" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://docs.hatchet.run/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fmulti-tenant-queues-1.f811f554.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://docs.hatchet.run/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fmulti-tenant-queues-1.f811f554.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>Next, let's assign task IDs according to the following algorithm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintain a unique numerical id <code dir="ltr">i</code> for each distinct group, and maintain a pointer <code dir="ltr">p</code> to the last block that was enqueued for each group - we'll call this <code dir="ltr">p(i)</code> .</li>
<li>Maintain a pointer <code dir="ltr">p</code> to the block containing the maximum task ID which doesn't have a <code dir="ltr">QUEUED</code> status (in other words, the maximum assigned task), call this <code dir="ltr">p_max_assigned</code>. If there are no tasks in the queue, set this to the maximum block across all <code dir="ltr">p(i)</code>. Initialize <code dir="ltr">p_max_assigned</code> at 0.</li>
<li>When a task is created in group <code dir="ltr">j</code>:<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>If this is a new group <code dir="ltr">j</code> is added, initialize <code dir="ltr">p(j)</code> to <code dir="ltr">p_max_assigned</code></li>
<li>If this is an existing group <code dir="ltr">j</code>, set <code dir="ltr">p(j)</code> to the greater of <code dir="ltr">p_max_assigned</code> or <code dir="ltr">p(j) + 1</code></li>
<li>Set the id of the task to <code dir="ltr">j + blockLength * p(j)</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>*Note:</strong> we are making a critical assumption that the number of unique group keys will always be below the <code dir="ltr">blockLength</code> , and increasing the blockLength in the future would be a bit involved. A blockLength of ~1 million gives us ~1 billion task executions. To increase the block length, it's recommended that you add an offset equal to the the maximum task id, and start assigning task ids from there. We will also (in the worst case) cap out at 1 billion executed tasks, though this can be fixed by reassigning IDs when close to this limit.*</p>
<h3>SQL implemenation<a href="#sql-implemenation" id="sql-implemenation" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>To actually implement this, let's add a new set of tables to our queue implementation. We'll add a table for <code dir="ltr">task_groups</code>, which maintains the pointer <code dir="ltr">p(i)</code> from above, along with a table called <code dir="ltr">task_addr_ptrs</code> which maintains <code dir="ltr">p_max_assigned</code> from above:</p>

<p>Next, we'll write our <code dir="ltr">CreateTask</code> query using a <code dir="ltr">blockLength</code> of <code dir="ltr">1024*1024</code>:</p>

<p>The great thing about this is that our <code dir="ltr">PopTasks</code> query doesn't change, we've just changed how we assign IDs. However, we do need to make sure to update <code dir="ltr">task_addr_ptrs</code> in the same transaction that we pop tasks from the queue:</p>

<p>Against 1 million enqueued tasks with 1000 partitions, we still only need to search across 100 rows:</p>

<p>You may also have noticed that because we stopped using the window function, we've removed the issue of selecting for previously locked rows. So even if we start 10 workers at the same time, we're guaranteed to select unique rows again:</p>

<p>This doesn't come without a tradeoff: our writes are slower due to continuously updating the <code dir="ltr">block_addr</code> parameter on the <code dir="ltr">task_group</code>. However, even the writes are constant-time, so the throughput on writes is still on the order of 500 to 1k tasks/second. If you'd prefer a higher write throughput, setting a small limit for placing tasks in the <code dir="ltr">OVERFLOW</code> queue and using the partition method from above may be a better approach.</p>
<h2>Introducing concurrency limits<a href="#introducing-concurrency-limits" id="introducing-concurrency-limits" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>In the above implementation, we had a simple <code dir="ltr">LIMIT</code> statement to set an upper bound of the number of tasks a worker should execute. But what if we want to set a concurrency limit for each group of tasks? For example, not only do we want to limit a worker to 100 tasks globally, but we limit each group to 5 concurrent tasks (we'll refer to this number as <code dir="ltr">concurrency</code> below). This ensures that even if there are slots available on the worker, they are not automatically filled by the same user, which could again crowd out other users in the near future.</p>
<p>Luckily, this is quite simple with the implementation above. Because of the way we've divided task ids across different block addresses, we can simply limit concurrency by searching only from the minimum queued ID <code dir="ltr">min_id</code> to <code dir="ltr">min_id + blockLength * concurrency</code>:</p>

<p>This guarantees an additional level of fairness which makes it even harder for Bob's workloads to interfere with Alice's.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts<a href="#final-thoughts" id="final-thoughts" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>We've covered deterministic round-robin queueing, but it turns out that many systems just need approximate fairness guarantees ("deterministic" in this case refers to the fact that tasks are processed in a deterministic order on subsequent reads - as opposed to using something like <code dir="ltr">ORDER BY RANDOM()</code>). But there are other approaches which provide approximate fairness, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/workload-isolation-using-shuffle-sharding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">shuffle sharding<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>, which we'll show how to implement in Postgres in a future post.</p>

<p dir="auto">Open MCT can be extended via plugins that make calls to the Open MCT API. A plugin is a group
of software components (including source code and resources such as images and HTML templates)
that is intended to be added or removed as a single unit.</p>
<p dir="auto">As well as providing an extension mechanism, most of the core Open MCT codebase is also
written as plugins.</p>

<p dir="auto">Certain terms are used throughout Open MCT with consistent meanings
or conventions. Any deviations from the below are issues and should be
addressed (either by updating this glossary or changing code to reflect
correct usage.) Other developer documentation, particularly in-line
documentation, may presume an understanding of these terms.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><em>plugin</em>: A plugin is a removable, reusable grouping of software elements.
The application is composed of plugins.</li>
<li><em>composition</em>: In the context of a domain object, this refers to the set of
other domain objects that compose or are contained by that object. A domain
object's composition is the set of domain objects that should appear
immediately beneath it in a tree hierarchy. A domain object's composition is
described in its model as an array of id's; its composition capability
provides a means to retrieve the actual domain object instances associated
with these identifiers asynchronously.</li>
<li><em>description</em>: When used as an object property, this refers to the human-readable
description of a thing; usually a single sentence or short paragraph.
(Most often used in the context of extensions, domain
object models, or other similar application-specific objects.)</li>
<li><em>domain object</em>: A meaningful object to the user; a distinct thing in
the work support by Open MCT. Anything that appears in the left-hand
tree is a domain object.</li>
<li><em>identifier</em>: A tuple consisting of a namespace and a key, which together uniquely
identifies a domain object.</li>
<li><em>model</em>: The persistent state associated with a domain object. A domain
object's model is a JavaScript object which can be converted to JSON
without losing information (that is, it contains no methods.)</li>
<li><em>name</em>: When used as an object property, this refers to the human-readable
name for a thing. (Most often used in the context of extensions, domain
object models, or other similar application-specific objects.)</li>
<li><em>navigation</em>: Refers to the current state of the application with respect
to the user's expressed interest in a specific domain object; e.g. when
a user clicks on a domain object in the tree, they are <em>navigating</em> to
it, and it is thereafter considered the <em>navigated</em> object (until the
user makes another such choice.)</li>
<li><em>namespace</em>: A name used to identify a persistence store. A running open MCT
application could potentially use multiple persistence stores, with the</li>

<p dir="auto">Support for our legacy bundle-based API, and the libraries that it was built on (like Angular 1.x), have now been removed entirely from this repository.</p>
<p dir="auto">For now if you have an Open MCT application that makes use of the legacy API, <a href="https://github.com/nasa/openmct-legacy-plugin">a plugin</a> is provided that bootstraps the legacy bundling mechanism and API.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Hoffmann et al. (2022) propose three methods for estimating a compute-optimal scaling law. We attempt to replicate their third estimation procedure, which involves fitting a parametric loss function to a reconstruction of data from their plots. We find that the reported estimates are inconsistent with their first two estimation methods, fail at fitting the extracted data, and report implausibly narrow confidence intervals--intervals this narrow would require over 600,000 experiments, while they likely only ran fewer than 500. In contrast, our rederivation of the scaling law using the third approach yields results that are compatible with the findings from the first two estimation procedures described by Hoffmann et al.
