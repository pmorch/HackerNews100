<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have posted this to four other Tesla related subreddits only to have them removed so hopefully this one sticks..</p>

<p>I have had a horrible experience with Tesla and their team in the past couple of days. My family purchased our new car a couple months ago and was enjoying it up until a few days ago when I tried to get the car into gear and it demanded that I input the password. Having not set up a password previously, I contacted Tesla about the issue. </p>

<p>While I was waiting to speak with a representative, I noticed that my car was no longer linked to my account on the app, nor could I log into my Tesla account. After waiting on hold for two hours, I was finally able to get through to a representative who informed me that I needed to contact Tesla Financial about this issue. I called the number provided immediately but they did not pick up as they were outside of working hours.</p>

<p>“Not a problem.” I thought. I’d call back again tomorrow and sort this out. I left my car in the parking lot at work overnight and had a family member pick me up and drop me off the next morning. While I’m working the next day, my boss informs me that there is a tow truck outside to tow my car. Confused, I went out to the parking lot and was told by the towing company that Tesla is repossessing my vehicle. </p>

<p>This is where my confusion grew. We had paid for the vehicle IN FULL at the time we picked it up from the dealership, but the towing company is just doing what tesla told them to do. so they took my car.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, my father received a phone call from Tesla Financial and he asked them what was going on. They told him that Tesla had been trying to reach out to us multiple times through phone and email about a debt they have been attempting to collect on the car. </p>

<p>My father had been out of the country for the past couple months so any phone calls would not have reached him. He did not receive a single voicemail about this issue either. He looked through his emails and noticed that he did in fact receive only two emails on July 27 and July 28, stating that we had not yet paid for the car and that the full cost of the vehicle is still at large. These emails went ignored as he believed them to be a phishing attempt because we had already PAID IN FULL at the dealership. He also believed that Tesla could not have made such a huge mistake like this.</p>

<p>My father explained this over the phone but the representative did not budge. This Tesla representative was rude and unprofessional for the entire phone call—going so far as to yell at my father over the phone.</p>

<p>A different Tesla representative sent us an email that seemed to be a copy paste of what they had sent my father back in July and that this car is now being considered for repossession. I shot an email back explaining AGAIN that this car had been paid for in full already and that we have been very dissatisfied by how Tesla had been handling this situation.</p>

<p>Up until this point, we were under the impression that Tesla was repossessing our vehicle without any warning because the two emails they sent to us regarding this seemed to be a phishing scam. Again they left no voicemails about this either. </p>

<p>The Tesla representative then emailed back this statement:</p>

<p>“I am having the team fully post the funds of the cashier's check. I am redrafting the documents and title/lien to your name instead of [BANK]. I have attached documents. Once funds post I can then restore access to the vehicle and release title/lien to your name.”</p>

<p>Basically saying that they had the check this whole time but due to some internal oversight had not cashed it. And they came after us, accused us of not paying, and repossessed our vehicle. Not only that, they incorrectly had the title of our car under the bank’s name rather than our own.</p>

<p>The next day, we received another email stating that the car is now back under our name and it can be picked up from the tow yard. </p>

<p>No apology. No restitution. </p>

<p>My father emailed them back saying he was glad the issue was resolved but was disappointed that there was no restitution offered, not even an apology. </p>

<p>They then emailed back the equivalent of saying “well we did try to contact you about this.” </p>

<p>I shot back an email stating that we are frustrated because it seems like this was an internal accounting issue that we should not have been contacted about or been involved in, in the first place. </p>

<p>Now we find ourselves carless for four days and will have to go out of our way to pick up a car that was wrongly repossessed. </p>

<p>And still Tesla offers no apology, restitution, and no guarantee that they are taking steps to prevent anything like this from happening in the future.</p>

<p>EDIT: the car was paid for with a combination of card and CASHIER’S check. Cashiers check means the amount of money is withdrawn from the bank when it’s ISSUED not cashed. so no, we did not notice extra money sitting in our account because it had already been withdrawn.</p>

<p>UPDATE: we got the car back today and there is no damage to it. we have been talking about getting an attorney or at least taking this to small claims court but in the end the decision comes down to what my dad wants to do as he owns the car. </p>

<p>will probably not be updating again because i’m tired of thinking about this but we’ll see. i’m really upset with tesla and would return the car if i could.</p>

							<p>Have you ever wandered into an old library or dusty bookshop and paused to breathe in that familiar vanilla-coffee-grassy scent wafting off the aged tomes? That nostalgic olfactory experience is thanks to a bouquet of chemical compounds.</p>
<p>Modern books smell different because of changes in manufacturing, while old books release distinctive <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-are-volatile-organic-compounds-vocs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volatile organic compounds</a> (VOCs) as they slowly decay. Scientists are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/13/scientists-preserving-books-smell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sniffing out these VOCs</a> to reveal secrets about a book’s age, condition, and history.</p>

<h3>The Chemistry of Paper</h3>
<p>Paper is made of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cellulose-fiber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cellulose fibers bound by lignin</a>, while inks and bindings add other organic compounds. Cellulose is a polymer made of long glucose chains, while lignin is a complex polymer found in plant cells.</p>
<p>Over time, light, heat, and moisture cause the paper and compounds to break down, releasing VOCs that vaporize into the air. The manufacturing process also affects the VOCs released as the book ages.</p>
<h3>Telltale Scents</h3>
<p>An almond scent comes from <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/240" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benzaldehyde</a> in the paper. <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Vanillin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanillin</a>, the main compound in vanilla, is responsible for a sweet vanilla fragrance. <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ethylbenzene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethylbenzene</a>, used in inks and paints, has a sweet plastic smell. <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2-Ethylhexan-1-ol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2-Ethyl hexanol</a>, found in solvents and scents, smells lightly floral.</p>
<p>New books use modern chemicals like hydrogen peroxide and alkyl ketene dimers, so they give off different VOCs. The VOCs can also indicate exposure to smoke, water damage, or other aging factors.</p>
<h3>Reading the Chemical Clues</h3>
<p>Scientists can analyze the VOCs from an old book to determine its age and condition. The mix of compounds can reveal if a book came from an early print shop versus a late 19th century press. They can also identify degradation and preservation needs.</p>
<p>Librarians and historians use VOC analysis to study collections and even match orphaned books with the libraries they came from based on chemical fingerprints. It provides clues to an old tome’s origins and secrets as it aged over decades or centuries.</p>
<h3>The Life Story in a Whiff</h3>
<p>So next time you get a whiff of an old book, take a moment to enjoy that aromatic time capsule. Its scent has a story to tell, echoing the people, places, and processes that brought an ancient text to you. With each sniff, we get a little closer to understanding our bibliophilic past.</p>

<p><strong>FAQs</strong></p>
<h2>Why do old books smell the way they do?</h2>
<p>Old books release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as they slowly decay over time. The specific VOCs depend on the paper, inks, and binding materials used, which give old books their distinctive scents.</p>
<h2>Do new and old books smell different?</h2>
<p>Yes, new books tend to smell more crisp and fresh, while old books have mustier, sweeter scents. This is because new book manufacturing uses different chemicals that produce different VOCs as they break down.</p>
<h2>What chemicals cause that nostalgic old book smell?</h2>
<p>Compounds like benzaldehyde, vanillin, ethylbenzene, and 2-ethyl hexanol are often responsible for old book scents. Benzaldehyde has an almond-like scent, vanillin smells like vanilla, ethylbenzene is sweet and plastic-y, and 2-ethyl hexanol is lightly floral.</p>
<h2>Can scientists learn about a book’s history from its smell?</h2>
<p>Yes, analyzing the volatile organic compounds released by a book can reveal details about its age, manufacturing origins, condition, and past exposure to elements like smoke or water. This helps determine preservation needs.</p>
<h2>How does paper decomposition create VOCs?</h2>
<p>Paper is made of cellulose and lignin. Over time, heat, light, and moisture cause these polymers to break down and release VOCs, which enter the air. The specific VOCs depend on the paper production process.</p>
<h2>Do libraries and museums use VOC analysis?</h2>
<p>Libraries and museums are beginning to use VOC analysis to identify preservation needs in collections. It can also help match orphaned books by chemical fingerprint to determine their original source library.</p>

                Friday, 11 August 2023 - 16:10
      </p>
    
        


  </div>

  
  
      
    
      
  
   
      
      <div><p>Amsterdam has started the fight against noisy motorcycles and cars. On Friday, the city placed electric road signs in two places to warn road users if their vehicles are too loud. The warnings will eventually be replaced by “noise cameras,” which, like speed cameras, automatically send a fine to the offending driver, Parool reports.</p>

<p>The test with the noise signs will start at the Stadhouderskade in the city center and Molenaarsweg in Amsterdam-Noord. The installation consists of a noise meter and a screen a little further on. If the meter registers too much noise, the driver will see the message “Te luid” - “Too loud” in Dutch. Later this month, more sound meters and signs will be installed on Europaboulevard in Zuid and on Tussen Meer in Nieuw-West. </p>

<p>The municipality hopes that the signs alone will already alert road users to the noise their vehicles make and prompt them to do something about it, a spokesperson told Parool.</p>

<p>Rotterdam is conducting a similar experiment in collaboration with Amsterdam. It is part of a broader approach, the municipality of Amsterdam spokesperson said. “Other measures we are taking include a simpler way of enforcement and a feasibility study by TNO into the application of the noise camera. We try to reduce noise nuisance in various ways.”</p>

<p>The noise camera consists of a box containing four microphones that can detect precisely where a sound is coming from. The box is connected to a regular speed camera, which takes a photo of the license plate to issue a fine. If the data from the current experiment proves reliable, Amsterdam and other large cities will ask the Cabinet to have the technology certified. </p>

(Sometimes the link fails right off the bat, giving you zero opportunity to read through the terms!)</p><p>So I would take advantage of that and save it, by any means necessary: screen scrape, copy-paste, print-as-PDF, take photo of screen with second device, whatever it took, because they could make it difficult!</p><p>But then I would usually end up with a copy of the contract that I could later call up and check on. So, your suggestion that analytics can determine my dwell time on the document when it's presented to me, that's not going to be indicative of how much time I really spent reading it after copying and saving it.</p><p>I've found that this is a good practice, and not for the reason you're thinking of. I've found that I'm extraordinarily bad at reading legal documents like this (including my lease, employment contract, benefits and insurance docs, you name it) because even if I think I understand, I didn't get it, and it's pointless anyway because negotiating the wording is not on the table.</p><p>But it's a good practice to save these, because of this: there are often instructions included about how to resolve disputes and claims against the company. These instructions usually follow a strict procedure and they have rules about what you can do. They also have contact info, and again, you will never ever find this contact info anywhere else ever again if you don't save the EULA at first opportunity. They will tell you what kind of arbitration or court proceedings are acceptable, they will tell you the complaints procedure from start to end, time frames, and what to expect at each point. This info is gold, and it's not going to be available when you come to have a dispute, and you're not even going to be aware of the procedure at that point, and so you will automatically be disqualified and lose any dispute because you didn't follow procedure. Have fun!

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/cruise-told-by-regulators-to-immediately-reduce-robotaxi-fleet-50-following-crash/">https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/cruise-told-by-regulators-to-immediately-reduce-robotaxi-fleet-50-following-crash/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37184904">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">Cruise, the self-driving car subsidiary of GM, has been asked to reduce its robotaxi fleet by 50% in San Francisco <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/18/cruise-robotaxi-involved-in-a-crash-with-fire-truck-one-passenger-injured/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following a crash</a> Thursday night with a fire truck.</p>
<p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles, the agency that regulates the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles in the state, requested the reduction in operations. The state agency said it is investigating “recent concerning incidents” involving Cruise vehicles in San Francisco. It called for Cruise to reduce its fleet by 50% and have no more than 50 driverless vehicles in operation during the day and 150 driverless vehicles in operation at night until the investigation is complete.</p>
<p>“Safety of the traveling public is the California DMV’s top priority,” the DMV said in a statement issued Friday evening, adding that it has the right, following the investigation to suspend or revoke testing and/or deployment permits if it determines there’s an unreasonable risk to public safety. “The primary focus of the DMV’s regulations is the safe operation of autonomous vehicles and safety of the public who share the road with these vehicles.”</p>
<p>Cruise told TechCrunch it is complying with the request. Cruise also <a href="https://getcruise.com/news/blog/2023/further-update-on-emergency-vehicle-collision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued a blog post</a> giving the company’s perspective of how and why the crash occurred.</p>
<p>“Over one hundred people lose their lives every day on American roadways, and countless others are badly injured, Cruise said in a statement sent via email. “We believe it’s clear that Cruise positively impacts overall road safety, and look forward to working with the CA DMV to make any improvements and provide any data they need to reinforce the safety and efficiency of our fleet.”</p>
<p>Cruise has had a series of snafus, including at least <a href="https://www.wafb.com/2023/08/15/driverless-cars-stall-causing-traffic-jam-san-francisco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mrf-link="https://www.wafb.com/2023/08/15/driverless-cars-stall-causing-traffic-jam-san-francisco/">10 of its driverless cars reportedly stalling</a> and blocking traffic, which threatens to derail its commercial plans. The string of glitches come just a week after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/cruise-and-waymo-win-robotaxi-expansions-in-san-francisco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">winning approval</a> from the California Public Utilities Commission to expand commercial operations in San Francisco.</p>
<p>The CPUC, the agency that regulates ride-hailing operations including those involving robotaxis, approved Cruise and Waymo on August 10 for final permits that allow the companies to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, expand their fleets and charge for rides throughout the city.</p>
<p>The latest Cruise incident occurred Thursday night when a Cruise robotaxi and an emergency vehicle crashed and left a passenger injured. Cruise said in a social media post that one of its self-driving Chevy Bolt EVs entered an intersection on a green traffic light at Polk and Turk streets when it was struck by an emergency vehicle that appeared to be en route to an emergency scene.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/17/san-francisco-presses-cpuc-to-halt-waymo-cruise-robotaxi-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed motions with the CPUC</a> to pause Cruise and Waymo’s plans to charge for robotaxi rides in the city at all hours. Chiu’s arguments parallel comments made by residents and other city officials during a public hearing ahead of the CPUC’s vote.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the second section of the third part of our planned five part series (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2023/07/21/collections-how-to-roman-republic-101-part-i-spqr/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2023/07/27/collections-how-to-roman-republic-101-part-ii-romans-assemble/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2023/08/11/collections-how-to-roman-republic-101-part-iiia-starting-down-the-path-of-honors/" data-type="post" data-id="20435">IIIa</a>) on the structure of the Roman Republic during the third and second centuries, the ‘Middle’ Republic.  Last week we discussed the overall structure of the ‘career path’ for a Roman politician and the first few offices along that path.  <strong>This week we’re going to look at the upper-steps of that career path, the offices of praetor and consul and the particular set of powers they possess, called <em>imperium</em></strong>, along with the pro-magistrate forms of these positions.  Now I should note at the outset that we have skipped one office on our way through, the tribunes of the plebs; we’ll get to that office <em>next</em> week to discuss its oddities and unusual powers.</p>



<p>The praestorship and the consulship are the highest Roman offices (the censorship being more of a ‘victory lap’) and the two offices that wield direct military and judicial authority.  These are also the offices where competition in the <em>cursus honorum</em> starts to get fierce, as the eight quaestors must compete for just six praetorships and those six praetors can expect to compete for just two – always two – consulships.  It is worth keeping in mind as we go through this that on the one hand <strong>these offices are largely confined to a small Roman elite, the <em>nobiles</em>, composed of families (both patrician and plebeian) that have been successful in politics over generations</strong>, but at the same time <strong>it is the popular assemblies which choose ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ from among the <em>nobiles</em></strong> by deciding who gets to proceed to the next round of the political elimination context, and who is forever going to sit in the Senate as a former quaestor and nothing more.</p>



<p>Now I am the only one of this blog who gets to have <em>imperium</em> (apparently <em>ACOUP</em> operates in the imperial where I have <em>imperium</em> and the guest-posters are my <em>legati</em>), but <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patrons at the <em>patres et matres conscripti</em></a> level can still advise me on how to use my <em>imperium</em>!  You don’t even have to have held the quaestorship!  As always, if you like this, please share it! If you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings, assuming there is still a Twitter by the time this post goes live.  I am also on Bluesky (@bretdevereaux.bsky.social) and (less frequently) Mastodon (@bretdevereaux@historians.social).</p>










<p>What connects these offices in particular is that they confer <em>imperium</em>, a distinctive concept in Roman law and governance.  The word <em>imperium</em> derives from the verb <em>impero</em>, ‘to command, order’ and so in a sense <em>imperium</em> simply means ‘command,’ but in its implication it is broader.  <em>Imperium</em> was understood to be the power of the king (Cic. <em>Leg. </em>3.8), encompassing both the judicial role of the king in resolving disputes and the military role of the king in leading the army.  In this sense, <em>imperium</em><strong> is the power to deploy violence on behalf of the community: both <em>internal </em>(judicial) violence and <em>external </em>(military) violence</strong>.</p>



<p>That power was represented visually around the person of magistrates with <em>imperium</em> through the lictors (Latin: <em>lictores</em>), attendants who follows magistrates with <em>imperium</em>, mostly to add dignity to the office but who also could act as the magistrates ‘muscle’ if necessary.  The lictors carried the <em>fasces</em>, a set of sticks bundled together in a rod; often in modern depictions the bundle is thick and short but in ancient artwork it is long and thin, the ancient equivalent of a police-man’s less-lethal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_(law_enforcement)" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_(law_enforcement)">billy club</a>.  That, notionally non-lethal but still violent, configuration represented the <em>imperium</em>-bearing magistrate’s civil power within the <em>pomerium</em> (recall, this is the sacred boundary of the city).  When passing beyond the <em>pomerium</em>, an axe was inserted into the bundle, turning the the non-lethal crowd-control device into a lethal weapon, reflective of the greater power of the <em>imperium-</em>bearing magistrate to act with unilateral <em>military</em> violence outside of Rome (though to be clear the consul couldn’t just murder you because you were on your farm; this is symbolism).  The consuls were each assigned 12 lictors, while praetors got 6.  Pro-magistrates had one fewer lictor than their magistrate versions to reflect that, while they wielded <em>imperium</em>, it was of an inferior sort to the actual magistrate of the year.</p>

<p>What is notable about the Roman concept of <em>imperium</em> is that it is a single, unitary thing: multiple magistrates can have <em>imperium</em>, you can have greater or lesser forms of <em>imperium</em>, but you cannot break apart the component elements of <em>imperium</em>.<span id="easy-footnote-1-20553"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-20553" title="I should note here that Drogula (in <em><a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3YDkX6I&quot; data-type=&quot;link&quot; data-id=&quot;https://amzn.to/3YDkX6I&quot;>Commanders and Command</a></em> (2015)) understands <em>imperium</em> a bit differently than this more traditional version I am presenting (in line with Lintott&amp;#8217;s understanding).  He contends that <em>imperium</em> was an entirely military power which was not necessary for judicial functions and was not only indivisible but also, at least early on, did not come in different degrees.  In practice, I&amp;#8217;m not sure the Romans were ever so precise with their concepts as Drogula wants them to be."><sup>1</sup></a></span>  This is a real difference from the <em>polis</em>, where the standard structure was to take the three components of royal power (religious, judicial and military) and split them up between different magistrates or boards in order to avoid any one figure being too powerful.  <strong>For the Romans, the royal authority over judicial and military matters were unavoidably linked because they were the same thing, <em>imperium</em>, and so could not be separated.</strong>  That in turn leads to Polybius’ awe at the power wielded by Roman magistrates, particularly the consuls (Polyb. 6.12); a <em>polis</em> wouldn’t generally focus so much power into a single set of hands constitutionally (keeping in mind that tyrants are <em>extra</em>-constitutional figures).</p>



<p>So what does <em>imperium</em> empower a magistrate to do?  All magistrates have <em>potestas</em>, the power to act on behalf of the community within their sphere of influence.  <em>Imperium</em> is the subset of magisterial <em>potestas</em> which covers the provision of violence for the community and it comes in two forms: the power to raise and lead armies and the power to organize and oversee courts.  Now we normally think of these powers as cut by that <em>domi et militiae</em> (“at home and on military service”) distinction we discussed<a href="https://acoup.blog/2023/07/21/collections-how-to-roman-republic-101-part-i-spqr/" data-type="link" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2023/07/21/collections-how-to-roman-republic-101-part-i-spqr/"> earlier in the series</a>: at home <em>imperium</em> is the power to organize courts (which are generally jury courts, though for some matters magistrates might make a summary judgement) and abroad the power to organize armies.  But as we’ll see when we get to the role of magistrates and pro-magistrates in the provinces, the power of legal judgement conferred by <em>imperium</em> is, if anything, <strong>more</strong> intense outside of Rome.  <strong>That said it is absolutely the case that <em>imperium</em> is <em>restrained</em> within the <em>pomerium</em> and far less restrained outside of it</strong>.</p>

<p>There were limits on the ability of a magistrate with <em>imperium</em> to deploy violence within the <em>pomerium</em> against citizens.  The <em>Lex Valeria</em>, dating to the very beginning of the <em>res publica</em> stipulated that in the case of certain punishments (death or flogging), the victim had the right of <em>provocatio</em> to call upon the judgement of the Roman people, through either an assembly or a jury trial.  That limit to the consul’s ability to use violence was reinforced by the <em>leges Porciae</em> (passed in the 190s and 180s), which protected civilian citizens from summary violence from magistrates, even when outside of Rome.  That said, on campaign – that is, <em>militae</em> rather than <em>domi</em> – these laws did not exempt citizen soldiers from beating or even execution as a part of military discipline and indeed Roman military discipline struck Polybius – himself an experienced Greek military man – as harsh (Polyb. 6.35-39).</p>



<p>In practice then, the ability of a magistrate to utilize <em>imperium</em> within Rome was hemmed in by the laws, whereas when out in the provinces on campaign it was far less limited.  A second power, <em>coercitio</em> or ‘coercion’ – the power of a higher magistrate to use minor punishments or force to protect public order – is sometimes presented as a distinct power of the magistrates, but I tend to agree with Lintott (<em>op. cit.</em>, 97-8) that this rather overrates the importance of the coercive powers of magistrates within the <em>pomerium</em>; in any case, the day-to-day maintenance of public order generally fell to minor magistrates.</p>



<p>While <em>imperium</em> was a ‘complete package’ as it were, the Romans clearly understood certain figures as having an <em>imperium</em> that outranked others, thus dictators could order consuls, who could order praetors, the hierarchy neatly visualized by the number of lictors each had.  This could create problems, of course, when Rome’s informal systems of hierarchy conflicted with this formal system, for instance at the Battle of Arausio, the pro-consul Quintus Servilius Caepio refused to take orders from the consul, Gnaeus Mallius Maximus, because the latter was his social inferior (being a <em>novus homo</em>, a ‘new man’ from a family that hadn’t yet been in the Senate and thus not a member of the <em>nobiles</em>), despite the fact that by law the <em>imperium</em> of a sitting consul outranked that of a pro-consul.  The result of that bit of insubordination was a military catastrophe that got both commanders later charged and exiled.</p>



<p>Finally, a vocabulary note: it would be reasonable to assume that the Latin word for a person with <em>imperium</em> would be <em>imperator</em><span id="easy-footnote-2-20553"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-20553" title="Pronunication note because this bothers me when I hear this word in popular media: it is not imPERator, but impeRAtor, because that &amp;#8216;a&amp;#8217; is long by nature, and thus keeps the stress."><sup>2</sup></a></span> because that’s the standard way Latin words form.  And I will say, from the perspective of a person who has to decide at the beginning of each thing I write what circumlocution I am going to use to describe “magistrate or pro-magistrate with <em>imperium</em>,” it would be remarkably fortunate if <em>imperator</em> meant that, but it doesn’t.  Instead, <em>imperator</em> in Latin ends up swallowed by its idiomatic meaning of ‘victorious general,’ as it was normal in the republic for armies to proclaim their general as <em>imperator</em> after a major victory (which set the general up to request a triumph from the Senate).  In the imperial period, this leads to the emperors monopolizing the term, as all of the armies of Rome operated under their <em>imperium</em> and thus all victory accolades belonged to the emperor.  That in turn leads to <em>imperator</em> becoming part of the imperial title, from where it gives us our word ’emperor.’</p>



<p>That said, the circumlocution I am going to use here, because this isn’t a formal genre and I can, is ‘<em>imperium</em>-haver.’  I desperately wish I could use that in peer reviewed articles, but I fear no editor would let me (while Reviewer 2 will predictably object to ‘general’ ‘commander’ or ‘governor’ for all being modern coinages).<span id="easy-footnote-3-20553"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-20553" title="And yes, really, I have had reviewers object to &amp;#8216;general&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;commander&amp;#8217; to mean &amp;#8216;the magistrate or pro-magistrate with <em>imperium</em> in the province.&amp;#8217;  There is no pleasing Reviewer 2."><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>



<p>On to our first set of <em>imperium</em>-havers!</p>



<h2>Praetors  </h2>



<p>The six praetors are the junior <em>imperium-</em>possessing magistracy and though all of the praetors were elected together, by the Middle Republic the job of being praetor might vary quite a lot depending on which role you were assigned by the Senate.  You will recall that the praetorship is an old office, originally taking the place of chief magistrate which later becomes the consulship (note Livy 3.5.11-12, 7.3.5-8; Cic. <em>Leg</em>. 3.8; Fest. 249L; Gell. 11.18.8, 20.1.47; Plin. <em>NH</em> 18.12 see also Varro <em>Ling</em>. 5.80), though at some point the title of the chief magistrate shifted being consul and the praetor (just one of them) served as a junior assistant to the consuls.  We’re not well informed about the praetorship in this early form, but it seems likely it had a similar role in organizing the courts, while the consuls led the armies.  In any case the number of praetors increases rapidly in the last half of the third century, with a second added in c. 242, two more in 228 and two more in 198/7, giving the total of six.</p>



<p>Because the praetors had <em>imperium</em>, they could in theory lead armies and organize courts the same as consuls (though they lacked some of the other distinctive consular powers we’ll discuss in a moment) but in practice the responsibilities of the praetors were usually quite distinct and split into two large categories: praetors assigned a <em>provincia</em> (which again, you should read as ‘job’ not ‘province’) at Rome and praetors assigned a <em>provincia</em> outside of Rome.</p>



<p>The two praetors operating normally in Rome were terms the <em>praetor urbanus</em> and <em>praetor peregrinus</em> and their responsibility was almost entirely focused on the court system.  The <em>praetor urbanus</em> was primarily concerned with legal disputes involved two citizen parties, while any issue involving foreigners came under the jurisdiction of the <em>praetor peregrinus</em>, though the latter was sometimes also deployed out of Rome on special duties, at which point the <em>praetor urbanus</em>, who almost always remained in Rome, would handle both.  On coming into office, the <em>praetor urbanus</em> (and probably also the <em>praetor peregrinus</em>) issued the <em>edictum praetoris</em> (‘Praetor’s edict’) which set out how he intended to carry out his office.  Early on, these edicts seem mostly to have been restricted to changes in procedure or the assessment of damages, but by the first century praetorian edicts could lay out substantive law creating what later Roman jurists would term the <em>ius praetorium</em> (‘praetorian law’), which sat alongside the main law code itself, the <em>ius civile</em> (‘civil law’).  Mostly what these edicts lay out seem to be procedures or the conditions under which the praetor will grant a cause of action.  By the time the edict is fully developed, praetors seem to be seeking and getting advice from an emerging class of legal experts, <em>iuris prudentes</em> (‘men learned at law’ = ‘legal consult’) to craft what must often have been pretty formulaic edicts.<span id="easy-footnote-4-20553"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-20553" title="To be clear, these are not <em>professional</em> lawyers, but rather generally elites who had taken a special interest in the law and thus become experts, on whom other elites holding offices might rely."><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>



<p>We’ll cover the Roman legal process towards the end of this series but we may cover the praetor’s role here in brief.  When a case was raised – and Roman law understands all cases as disputes just like Greek law does, though unlike in most Greek <em>poleis</em>, some Roman magistrates seem to have had an expectation to act as quasi-public prosecutors for certain kinds of infractions – it was brought before the praetor, either <em>urbanus</em> for an issue involving citizens or <em>peregrinus</em> for an issue involving at least one non-citizen.  At this point the matter was <em>in iure</em> (‘at law’) and the praetor held a sort of preliminary hearing to determine if there was a cause of action (thus the importance of this question in the praetor’s edict) and then to assign a judge (a <em>iudex</em>) who would administer the trial and to set a formula (<em>formula</em>, gotta love Latin), which functioned rather like jury instructions, naming the relevant parties, describing their dispute and setting out the consequences should the matter be ruled in favor of one or the other (this stage of the case is <em>apud iudicem</em>, ‘before a judge’).  Note that the praetor doesn’t make a ruling, but merely lays out the formula.</p>



<p>For more serious matters that required a jury court to resolve, a potential prosecutor went before the praetor, who then assigned the case to the relevant court or assembly (as assemblies, especially early on, could act as courts) and set a date for the trial.  Interestingly, for jury trials, no <em>formula</em> was provided by the praetor.</p>



<p>What about the praetors who weren’t assigned to Rome?  As the sphere of Roman military activity expanded beyond Italy, it became necessary to have more commanders in the field, and this is where we get the additional praetors.  Because a praetor has <em>imperium</em>, they can function as a sort of ‘mini-consul.’  That said, praetors don’t tend to get assigned the sorts of jobs consuls do.  If Rome needs three major field armies, the Senate generally doesn’t send a praetor to command the third, rather it sends a pro-consul (which makes a degree of sense when you think about it; you want an experienced commander).</p>



<p>Instead, praetors in the field tend to be assigned to putative ‘quiet’ provinces or auxiliary support functions.  The standard praetorian provinces were <em>Corsica et Sardinia</em> (one province) and Sicily, later joined by the two Spains (<em>Hispania Citerior</em>, ‘Nearer Spain’ and <em>Hispania Ulterior</em>, ‘Further Spain), when they were quiet.  When a major military action flared up on this areas, the response wasn’t to send a praetor with a large army, but to assign a consul or a pro-consul to the province instead, though because these assignments are made annually that tends to mean that trouble flares up, the praetor with his smaller army tries to manage it and if he fails and is defeated, <em>then</em> a consul is sent out with a major army.</p>



<p>Now I don’t want to get entirely off-track detailing what a Roman commander does in his overseas <em>provincia</em>; I may add a supplemental post on this one describing what Roman provincial government looks like in the Republic (though for the curious, the book to read is F.K. Drogula, <a href="https://amzn.to/3qxEjh1" data-type="link" data-id="https://amzn.to/3qxEjh1"><em>Commanders and Command</em> </a>(2015); it’s a bit dry, but quite thorough).  But in brief a praetor in his overseas <em>provincia</em> is going to have command of whatever military forces are there, generally less than the standard two-legion consular army (sometimes a lot less!).  If there is no active military campaign to be done, the praetor will transit around the province.  Because he has <em>imperium</em>, he can resolve disputes as a court and in the provinces – because <em>imperium</em> is stronger outside of Rome – he can do so summarily so long as Roman citizens are not involved.  He can enforce these resolutions on non-Romans in the province because he has a Roman army and the implicit backing of the rest of the Roman state.  Note that the praetor in his province doesn’t take over day-to-day garden variety law and order issues; those are still handled by local governments, according to local laws.</p>



<p>Generally the expectation is that a praetor is going to use his mix of military force and his ability to resolve disputes and deliver judgements to keep good order in the region and to make sure that Rome’s taxes are collected.  In practice within those confines, there’s a lot of latitude, though the Senate may make certain specific demands as part of a praetor’s assignment.  The praetor is also assisted by an assigned quaestor who handles the financial side of things and is expected to consult a small council of advisors, a <em>consilium</em>, when making decisions.  Finally, beginning in 149, there is a permanent court in Rome which has the job of handling the cases of governors who exceeded their mandate in the provinces, the <em>quaestio de repetundis</em>; the name literally means ‘the court for things you need to give back’ because the primary concern was governors extorting money and taking bribes in their provinces.  So the praetor’s latitude is not infinite.</p>



<p>As the number of active <em>provinciae</em> became too large for even the larger number of praetors and the two consuls, the Senate took to having former praetors serve as ‘pro-praetors,’ a kind of pro-magistrate, but we’ll talk about them below, after we’ve discussed the most important Roman magistrate, the consuls.</p>



<h2>The Consuls</h2>



<p>The consuls, always a pair, are the senior magistrates of the Roman Republic.  While the censors, if there are any in office, may be themselves senior consulars (that is, ex-consuls), the sitting consuls are still the most powerful magistrates.  Consuls wield <em>imperium</em>, but of a greater degree than any other magistrate or pro-magistrate (save a dictator), allowing them to in theory give orders to other magistrates (though this doesn’t happen often).  The consuls also lead Rome’s primary field armies through the Middle Republic (this shifts only with Sulla’s reforms in 83).</p>



<p>While in theory the consuls’ possession of <em>imperium</em> meant they could superintend the courts, they generally didn’t (some Late Republic exceptions, like Pompey presiding over the trial of Titus Annius Milo are remarkable for being unusual).  Instead, we most often see consuls in two roles: moving major legislation and leading Rome’s main field armies.  In the former case, technically the praetors could legislate as well as the consuls, but in practice major laws tended to be proposed by either the consuls or the plebeian tribunes.</p>



<p>Each consul would also command a major field army.  The Romans do not do army-command-by-committee (unlike Athens), so under normal circumstances the consuls each had independent command over their own army.  The standard strength of a consular army was two legions (8,400 infantry, 600 cavalry) plus two <em>alae</em> of <em>socii</em> (varies but roughly the same size, with somewhat more cavalry), meaning that each consul in the Middle Republic goes to war with a chunky c. 20,000 man army.  It was only in rare circumstances that these armies would be combined and such combined ‘double consular’ armies often caused problems if the consuls couldn’t get along or agree on a strategic vision.</p>



<p>That said, how many troops a consul might have and where he would be expected to take them was largely determined by the Senate.  The Senate, as we’ll see, assigns <em>provincia</em> (again, think ‘jobs’ not ‘provinces’) – even to the consuls – and it also directs the quaestors on how resources are to be allocated.  That includes conscription (the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2023/06/16/collections-how-to-raise-a-roman-army-the-dilectus/" data-type="post" data-id="19439"><em>dilectus</em>) </a>and we see repeatedly that consuls do not feel they can hold a <em>dilectus</em> without the consent of the Senate; they can take volunteers without senatorial approval, but a draft, no.  Likewise, unless they can find volunteer <em>funding</em>, they are reliant on quaestors releasing funds, quaestors who are always going to do what the Senate tells them to do.</p>



<p>However, the Senate can’t come on campaign with the consuls and so once in the field, dealing with whatever problem the Senate has suggested they deal with, the consuls have a great deal of command independence and nearly limitless authority.  Whereas at Rome consular authority is constrained by laws and the plebeian tribunes (whose powers end at the <em>pomerium</em>), in the field they can implement strict military discipline and command their armies as they see fit.  That extends to considerable latitude when it comes to negotiating with foreign states (neutral or hostile), though any treaty they make must be ratified back in Rome (technically requiring approval of an assembly but in practice this depends on if the Senate approves).</p>



<p>Now with such sweeping powers the Romans were naturally concerned that the consuls might usurp the state, so they instituted a few basic checks on this.  One of these checks is simply the existence of the plebeian tribunes, but we’ll talk about those next time.  But also it was clearly established that there must <em>always</em> be two consuls.  Not one, not three.  <em>Two</em>.  If one consul dies, another must be immediately elected; this replacement consul was called a <em>consul suffectus</em> (the year was still dated from the two consuls elected at the beginning, the <em>consules ordinarii</em>).  Because only a consul had the authority to hold a consular election, you needed a system to handle situations where both consuls were indisposed at once (either both dead or one dead and one abroad with the army); the solution was a rare official, the <em>interrex</em>, who only had the authority to hold an election for the consulship.</p>



<p>Once you’ve ensured there are always two consuls, the next trick is to make sure they can check each other.  To ensure that, consuls were given some substantial powers.  The most famous of these was <em>veto</em>, Latin for “I forbid!”  Just by saying the word, a consul could block any action by any other magistrate, <em>including the other consul</em>.  The power had to be exercised in person, which limited it: if you really wanted to prevent your colleague from doing something he <em>really</em> wanted to do, you best be prepared to follow him around in person every day to keep vetoing it.  A supercharged for of veto consuls could also exercise was <em>iustitium</em>, declaring a stop to all state business; this could be used to stop any meeting of a popular assembly or of the Senate so long as the assembly had not dispersed into voting groups.</p>



<p>The final check on the consuls is pretty simple: they only serve for one year.  After which it is generally expected that there be a respectable interval (usually around 10 years) before you can run for the consulship again.  <strong>While in office, any Roman with <em>imperium</em> is immune from prosecution</strong>, but can be prosecuted immediately on leaving office for any crimes they may have done while in office.  Consequently, a consul’s freedom of action is going to be limited by their concern about potentially having to face a jury after their one-year term is complete.  Even if they aren’t worried about that, once their year is done they go back to being just another senator, so good relations with the rest of the Senate is a good idea.</p>



<p>In part because one of the <em>other</em> things the Senate decides on are…</p>



<h2>Pro-Magistrates</h2>



<p>Roman expansion put strains on all of these systems.  <strong>Fundamentally, the Roman system remained one designed for a small city-state</strong>.  Everything – military command, attending the Senate, passing legislation, using veto power – needed to be done in person by magistrates who only had a single year in office.  While Roman territory and the scope of Rome’s wars remained small, that sort of system worked fine.  As Roman territory and Rome’s wars expanded, it put all sorts of strains on that system: how to handle multi-year campaigns which kept the armies in the field?  How to handle having more commands than magistrates?</p>



<p>The solution was to extend (prorogue) a magistrate’s authority, making them a pro-magistrate (‘pro’ meaning ‘standing in for’).  It’s tricky to pin down exactly when the Romans first did this as our sources for early Rome (Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus) tend to use terms for proconsular power (<em>pro consule</em> or ἀνθύπατον ἀρχὴν) long before prorogation seems to have been used in Rome.  Generally, we think that the first genuine prorogation happens in 327 as part of the run-up to the Second Samnite War (Livy 8.23).<span id="easy-footnote-5-20553"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-20553" title="On this, see Drogula, <em>op. cit.</em> 27."><sup>5</sup></a></span>  The problem here was two-fold: Rome’s evident shift to year-round campaigning meaning that the army needed a continous commander in the field as in this case where it was conducting a siege, combined with the greater distances – the commander, Q. Pubilius Philo, is besieging Naples – making swift changes in command difficult.</p>



<p>Prorogation becomes common and regular during the Punic Wars.  The First Punic War, taking place primarily in Sicily, demanded the use of prorogation to cover the lag time between elections in Rome and commanders arriving in Sicily, as well as to allow single commanders to conduct more complex campaigns.  By the Second Punic War, which takes place in Italy, Sicily, Gaul, Spain, North Africa and Illyria (much of that <em>simultaneously</em>) it was also necessary to prorogue commanders in order to simply get enough field commanders with <em>imperium</em> for all of the armies Rome was deploying.  Indeed, in the crazy days of the Second Punic War, at points the Senate prorogued men who had never held office before, <em>privati cum imperio</em> (private citizens with <em>imperium</em>), though this is discontinued and replaced by a system whereby prorogued commanders will have first held the relevant office at some point.</p>



<p>The expanding number of areas of Roman overseas control pushed this further as more regions meant more <em>provinciae</em> (in the sense of ‘jobs’) which demanded more <em>imperium</em>-havers to handle.  New praetors were eventually made for Sicily, Corsica-and-Sardinia and the two Spains, but by the mid-second century the Romans are regularly assigning <em>imperium</em>-havers to Gaul (Cisalpine or Transalpine), Africa, Greece and Macedonia and of course also need magistrates with <em>imperium</em> in Italy to handle the regular functions of government.<span id="easy-footnote-6-20553"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-20553" title="Macedonia as a permanent province is added in 147, Africa in 146 and Asia in 129, followed by Gallia Narbonensis in 120.  No new praetors are created for this province; they&amp;#8217;re handled by promagistrates when things are calm enough not to require a consul."><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>



<p>One of the pressures here is that by this point it was clearly locked into tradition that there were only ever two consuls.  It had not <em>always</em> been that way; back when the Romans had military tribunes with consular powers, they had three of them.  But by the third century, there were always and could only be two consuls.  But that’s a problem because even if you have spare praetors, you don’t assign praetors to <em>major</em> military commands, so if you have <em>three</em> major military commands, you don’t send a praetor, you assign a proconsul.</p>



<p>The result of all of this is that each year the most pressing military problems generally got a consul assigned to them.  Often the military problem from last year that was on-going would see its ex-consul prorogued to continue handling it.  Likewise, the new praetors would be sent out to replace the governors in quiet provinces, with the remainder who weren’t replaced prorogued to hold down the fort for another year.  Later it is going to become quite common for former praetors and consuls who had returned to Rome to be dispatched back out to the provinces to do a stint as a promagistrate, but the common use of this is really a consequence of the Sullan reforms and for the most part belongs to the first century.  Most third and second century promagistrates are having an existing command <em>extended</em> rather than being sent out fresh.</p>



<p>Extensions of this sort, I should note, were generally fairly short.  The longest run I can think of in this period is that of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus who is <em>privati cum imperio</em> <em>pro consule</em> (‘private citizen with pro-consular imperium’) from 210 to 206, mostly as a product of his father and uncle having been the local Roman commanders in Spain and Scipio having taken over when they were both killed, leading to an irregular, emergency command.  He’s then consul in 205, before having his command prorogued from 204 to 201 to complete his invasion of Africa (technically, he’s assign to Sicily with permission to invade Africa if an opportunity presented itself).</p>



<p>Far more typical for even an exceptional commander was something like Scipio Aemilianus’ experience.  Consul in 147, he is prorogued to complete the destruction of Carthage in 146.  Then, consul in 134, he is prorogued to complete the destruction of Numantia in 133.  And that was that.  The point here being that the heavy reliance on proconsuls to conduct the main effort in Roman wars, often with longer commands (most famously Caesar’s <em>eight years</em> in Gaul or Pompey’s back-to-back eastern commands from 67 to 62) visible in the Late Republic was not common practice in the Middle Republic.</p>



<p>One significant legal quirk of prorogation is that while a consul or a praetor at least notionally had <em>imperium</em> which traveled (though in practice they would be expected to focus on the <em>provincia</em> the Senate assigned them), the <em>imperium</em> of a promagistrate, who after all only ‘stood in for’ the actual magistrate of the year, was in fact restricted to their defined sphere of action.</p>



<p>My plan once we’ve gone through the whole Roman system <em>for Romans</em> is to add two more posts on this series (perhaps not coming right away), one covering how the Roman Republic interacts with the <em>socii</em> and another briefly describing the shape of Roman governance in the provinces<span id="easy-footnote-7-20553"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-7-20553" title="Places, not jobs, for once."><sup>7</sup></a></span>  But for now, that’s enough on <em>imperium</em>.  Next week, we’re going to look at two very strange major offices, the tribunate and the censorship, plus discuss what we know of the key minor offices of the republic.</p>
<ol><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-1-20553"></span>I should note here that Drogula (in <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3YDkX6I" data-type="link" data-id="https://amzn.to/3YDkX6I">Commanders and Command</a></em> (2015)) understands <em>imperium</em> a bit differently than this more traditional version I am presenting (in line with Lintott’s understanding).  He contends that <em>imperium</em> was an entirely military power which was not necessary for judicial functions and was not only indivisible but also, at least early on, did not come in different degrees.  In practice, I’m not sure the Romans were ever so precise with their concepts as Drogula wants them to be.<a href="#easy-footnote-1-20553"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-2-20553"></span>Pronunication note because this bothers me when I hear this word in popular media: it is not imPERator, but impeRAtor, because that ‘a’ is long by nature, and thus keeps the stress.<a href="#easy-footnote-2-20553"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-3-20553"></span>And yes, really, I have had reviewers object to ‘general’ or ‘commander’ to mean ‘the magistrate or pro-magistrate with <em>imperium</em> in the province.’  There is no pleasing Reviewer 2.<a href="#easy-footnote-3-20553"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-4-20553"></span>To be clear, these are not <em>professional</em> lawyers, but rather generally elites who had taken a special interest in the law and thus become experts, on whom other elites holding offices might rely.<a href="#easy-footnote-4-20553"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-5-20553"></span>On this, see Drogula, <em>op. cit.</em> 27.<a href="#easy-footnote-5-20553"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-6-20553"></span>Macedonia as a permanent province is added in 147, Africa in 146 and Asia in 129, followed by Gallia Narbonensis in 120.

Jonathan Ernst</span>)</span></span></figcaption></p></figure><p>Beijing has conducted massive military exercises close to Taiwan, raising fears that Chinese President Xi Jinping will fulfil his promise to take control of Taiwan — either with an invasion, or a blockade.</p><p>Should China take Taiwan, it would have control of TSMC — one of the world's most valuable resources.</p><p>China could stop selling the West chips or sell them at such high prices that it makes non-Chinese companies unprofitable.</p><p>To try and get around that, the US, Germany and Japan have convinced TSMC to start construction on factories in their countries, to ensure a supply of chips to the US and its allies.</p><p>Some pundits have suggested that the US should threaten to destroy TSMC's Taiwanese factories if China tries to invade, hoping this would be a strong disincentive.</p><p>Chang is now 92, and told the New York Times that he doesn't think invasion is likely.</p><p>But as the Chinese military increases its presence in the sea and sky around Taiwan, some American investors, like billionaire Warren Buffett, also 92, have decided the risk is too great, and have sold their stake in TSMC.</p></div><p><span data-component="Text">Posted<!-- -->&nbsp;</span><time data-component="ScreenReaderOnly" datetime="2023-08-18T19:38:44.000Z">12 hours ago</time><time data-component="Text">Fri

Ukrainian authorities attributed it to heavy military equipment that they said was stirring up radioactive dirt that had settled in the ground following the 1986 nuclear accident at the plant and condemned Russia for creating a scenario that posed a radiological risk not only to Ukraine but also to Europe.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png" width="586" height="282.13324175824175" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:701,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:586,&quot;bytes&quot;:2665582,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff06d25bd-e686-4377-90ab-3f672a0ec3d0_1782x858.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>CCTV footage captured the Russian military convoy passing through checkpoint Leliv, about nine miles southeast of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on the afternoon of February 24, 2022.

You should probably read the story first to understand the context for what I’m going to discuss here.</p><p>There are about 68 battery-powered radiation sensors at Chernobyl, called GammaTRACERs, that are spread throughout the CEZ. They’re managed by the State Specialized Enterprise Ecocenter (Ecocenter for short). These detectors continuously record ambient gamma radiation levels and calculate an average before transmitting that figure wirelessly (using a SkyLINK module) to a base station in an Ecocenter office in the town of Chernobyl. Those readings, transmitted once an hour, get analyzed by software and then are posted to the Ecocenter’s web site. </p><p>Santamarta considered a number of ways the data might have been manipulated:  Someone could have hacked individual sensors to alter the data before it was transmitted, or intercepted and altered it while it was in transit to the base station. But this would have been too much work and been inefficient. Instead, based on the patterns, he concluded that the most likely way for someone to alter the data was to write malicious code that altered it on the Ecocenter’s server, after it was aggregated from all of the sensors. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png" width="524" height="297.989010989011" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:828,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:524,&quot;bytes&quot;:320671,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a88d931-c28c-499b-89e3-60b5033db0bd_1480x842.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Model of a GammaTRACER radiation detector.</figcaption></figure></div><p>During the period in question, forty-two sensors spiked, most of them simultaneously in clusters.

Aside from the geographical distance between spiking sensors, it should have been obvious something was wrong with the data when  sensors that spiked quickly returned to normal levels.</p><p><span>In fact, a number of people outside Ukraine were expressing doubt about the authenticity of the data — including a radiation expert in France who told a reporter the data </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-nuclear-agency-reports-higher-chernobyl-radiation-levels-due-heavy-2022-02-25/" rel="">might have been hacked</a><span>. </span></p><p>Yet officials in Ukraine, and at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna — the United Nations body that monitors nuclear facilities around the world — didn’t investigate or even notice something was wrong with the data. Why?</p><p>The war was raging, Ukrainians were in a fight for their lives and country and were uncertain if money and military equipment would come from abroad. And staff at the Chernobyl plant were being held hostage by Russian troops. These are all good reasons why neither Ukrainian officials nor the IAEA would have taken time to notice or investigate the suspicious data patterns when they occurred. And if the IAEA suspected the data was false, this would be another reason not to become alarmed and hurry an investigation.</p><p>Yet its public statements indicated the IAEA believed the data was accurate. So why not, once Russian soldiers departed Chernobyl at the end of March, conduct an investigation then?</p><p><span>The IAEA sent experts to do a radiological survey in the CEZ in April, but their focus wasn’t on determining the cause of the spikes. Investigators instead wanted to determine if Russian soldiers who dug trenches in a small section of the CEZ had released dangerous levels of radiation in that area that could have sickened the soldiers or anyone else who passed through that area. (The IAEA determined the radiation levels from trench-digging could not have made the soldiers ill.) Three months later, the Ukrainian government invited Greenpeace to conduct its own radiological survey of the areas where Russian soldiers had camped, and they also did not look into the cause or veracity of the February spikes. (They concluded that the radiation levels where the soldiers camped were three times what the IAEA reported and </span><a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/54762/greenpeace-investigation-challenges-nuclear-agency-on-chornobyl-radiation-levels/" rel="">accused the IAEA of being untrustworthy</a><span> because IAEA Deputy Director Mikhail Chudakov, a Russian, is a long-term official with ROSATOM, Russia’s state atomic corporation.) </span></p><p>It seems strange, Santamarta told me, that both the IAEA and Greenpeace would put effort into determining if Russian soldiers were endangered from digging trenches in one small part of the CEZ and not be concerned about much higher radiation levels that sensors had recorded in other parts of the CEZ — including parts where Chernobyl staff were working.</p><p>One can understand on the surface why the IAEA might not have investigated — the agency had issued a statement after the spikes occurred saying the radiation levels had only reached 9 µSv/h, a level that posed no danger to the workers at Chernobyl or the public. But as I note in the WIRED story, the IAEA was basing this assessment on incomplete information Ukraine provided. In fact, the spikes had already reached more than 90 µSv/h by the time the agency released its statement, but the IAEA never mentioned this in its statement. </p><p>Tero Karhunen, senior inspector with Finland’s radiation and nuclear safety authority, known as STUK, told me that if ambient dose rates rise above 100 µSv/h for more than 48 hours, this normally triggers an evacuation of the affected region. The data from Chernobyl was all posted to the Ecocenter web site for everyone to see, including the IAEA, yet the agency ignored the higher numbers. Why?</p><p>Did the IAEA know or suspect the spikes were false and therefore wanted to calm the public by citing only the lower numbers? The agency wouldn’t answer any questions I sent. </p><p>The implications, if it knew or suspected the data was false and didn’t investigate, are concerning. The implications if it believed the data was accurate and told the public the radiation posed no danger to the public, when in fact 90 µSv/h did potentially pose a danger, are also concerning.</p><p><strong>Why Did Sensor Data Stop Getting Updated?</strong></p><p>The spikes occurred over a 14-hour period, with a number of the sensors spiking multiple times throughout this time. With some sensors that spiked more than once, the second spike was lower than the first. But other sensors that spiked more than once showed dramatic increases with the second spike — including two sensors that spiked to nearly 100 µSv/h. These two sensors, known as DGS-2 and HZHTO, initially spiked at 9:50 pm on the night of February 24 and then again at 10:40 am the next morning. </p><p>DGS-2 (which normally recorded a radiation dose level of 7.67 µSv/h) spiked to 58.8 µSv/h at 9:50 pm on February 24th, and then to 93 µSv/h at 10:40 am the next morning. And HZHTO (which normally recorded a radiation dose level of 2.98 µSv/h spiked to 65.5 µSv/h at 9:50 pm and then to 93 at 10:40 am the next morning.</p><p>Both DGS-2 and HZHTO got very close to 100 µSv/h — the level which Karhunen says generally triggers an evacuation if it lasts for 48 hours. Given the upward trajectory of the spikes between 9:40 pm and 10:50 am, it’s possible they would have climbed higher with subsequent spikes. We’ll never know if they would have reached higher levels, however, because the Ecocenter’s online map stopped updating data after 10:50 am on February 25th. This meant nuclear experts outside Ukraine, and others who were monitoring the Ecocenter web site to track the radiation levels in the CEZ, were suddenly blind to what was occurring there.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png" width="374" height="517.3946188340807" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1234,&quot;width&quot;:892,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:374,&quot;bytes&quot;:157054,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3f8afe9-5509-4ea1-8dec-3770b0f09c4f_892x1234.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Image showing the two sensors — DGS-2 and HZHTO — whose ambient dose rates were nearing 100 µSv/h before the Ecocenter’s web site stopped updating data from all of the sensors.</figcaption></figure></div><p>It’s not clear why the data suddenly stopped, but there are a couple of possibilities. The following is speculation.</p><ol><li><p>Ukraine was experiencing intermittent internet and electricity outages on the day of the invasion, and it’s possible the Ecocenter’s internet service went out. In this case, the radiation sensors in the CEZ would still have recorded radiation levels (they are battery operated after all) and they still would have transmitted the data to the Ecocenter base station. With the internet out, however, the data could not get posted to the Ecocenter’s web site. But once internet connectivity was restored, data held in reserve should have posted. Indeed, data from the sensors all came back online the following Monday, February 28 (at this point they were all reporting normal radiation levels again). The sensors all went offine again by March 3, however, and remained that way until long after Russian soldiers ended their occupation of the Chernobyl plant and CEZ. </p></li><li><p>But there’s an alternate theory. If internet outages didn’t prevent the data from getting uploaded to the Ecocenter web site, and the sensors themselves were still recording and transmitting data, there is a possibility that someone pulled the plug on the Ecocenter server that was used to process and upload the data to the web site. Ukrainian authorities say that Russian soldiers at the Ecocenter’s office in Chernobyl stole the hard drive from the server used to process the radiation data, but couldn’t say when that occurred — on March 3 when the web site stopped posting data or later as the soldiers were departing Chernobyl. If they stole it on March 3, this could explain why the data stopped updating. But if they stole it later than this, then this doesn’t explain why data stopped updating to the web site. And it suggests that somene intentionally stopped the data from posting — possibly because they knew the data was false and feared that radiation levels higher than 100 µSv/h would get posted to the web site and cause panic.</p></li><li><p>There’s another mystery, however. Ordinarily the Ecocenter’s system automatically transmits the sensor data to the IAEA around the same time it’s posted to the Ecocenter’s online map. But at some point on February 24, the IAEA stopped receiving this direct data transmission, even though data continued to get updated to the Ecocenter’s web site until February 25th, and then again on the 28th when all of the sensor data came back online. Did someone know the data was false and halt the transmission to prevent the IAEA from acting on false data if the levels increased to 100 µSv/h? There are a lot of unanswered questions.</p></li></ol><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png" width="518" height="386.02547770700636" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:936,&quot;width&quot;:1256,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:518,&quot;bytes&quot;:1693272,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb3bfe1e-bdf3-4fea-8524-c9aafef3d955_1256x936.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The GammaTRACERs store data in their memory. This data could be used to verify if the data the Ecocenter posted to its web site was accurate. If someone had altered the data on the Ecocenter server, it wouldn’t match the data stored in the memory of the sensors. The memory of these devices only hold so much data, however, before it’s overwritten, and it’s not clear if the data from February 2022 still remains in them.</p><p>In addition to the digital GammaTRACERs that measure energy produced by ionizing radiation, some of the sensor stations also have an aerosol filter that measures ambient dose levels in the air. These filters are much more sensitive to radiation changes than the digital sensors and therefore are more accurate in detecting radiation dose levels. The filters would have been a great way for Ukraine to verify that the levels recorded by the GammaTRACERs were accurate.</p><p>Prior to the invasion, Chernobyl workers would collect these filters once a week to test them in a lab. But during the occupation of Chernobyl, it appears workers were prevented from collecting and testing the filters. Once Russian soldiers left Chernobyl and the CEZ, however, it would have been a great time for workers to collect the filters and test them. Unfortunately, according to a nuclear expert from Greenpeace who entered the CEZ a few months after the Russians left, there were landmines littered throughout the CEZ and it would have been dangerous for workers to collect the filters. It’s unclear if the filters have been collected since then.  </p><p>One other way to verify the accuracy of the sensor data — either after the Russians left or today — would be to do a forensic investigation of the sensors themselves and the Ecocenter server used to process and publish the data online. Unfortunately, the Ecocenter server — or its hard drive — is gone. According to Ukrainian authorities, the Russians took it. They also took specialized software used to process and analyze the sensor data.</p><p>The server is an important piece of the puzzle and could help determine if someone manipulated the sensor data. The Ukrainians say that Russian soldiers absconded with the entire server when they left Chernobyl. Workers at the Ecocenter even appeared to show a French TV station the empty cabinet where the server had been stored.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89bff27a-ca25-4ca4-9f62-d39dcd840cb8_618x694.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89bff27a-ca25-4ca4-9f62-d39dcd840cb8_618x694.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89bff27a-ca25-4ca4-9f62-d39dcd840cb8_618x694.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89bff27a-ca25-4ca4-9f62-d39dcd840cb8_618x694.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89bff27a-ca25-4ca4-9f62-d39dcd840cb8_618x694.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89bff27a-ca25-4ca4-9f62-d39dcd840cb8_618x694.png" width="398" height="446.94498381877025" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/89bff27a-ca25-4ca4-9f62-d39dcd840cb8_618x694.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:694,&quot;width&quot;:618,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:398,&quot;bytes&quot;:634053,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89bff27a-ca25-4ca4-9f62-d39dcd840cb8_618x694.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89bff27a-ca25-4ca4-9f62-d39dcd840cb8_618x694.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89bff27a-ca25-4ca4-9f62-d39dcd840cb8_618x694.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89bff27a-ca25-4ca4-9f62-d39dcd840cb8_618x694.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Image reportedly showing the looted cabinet that once held the server used to analyze and process data from the radiation sensors in the CEZ.</figcaption></figure></div><p>When I asked Ukrainian authorities in charge of the Ecocenter lab what the Russians took from that facility, they told me they didn’t take entire components.

Perhaps the answer is as simple as space. They didn’t have enough space in their military vehicles to carry entire computer towers back to Russia, so they just took the hard drives. But why take the hard drives?</p><p>If the radiation data at Chernobyl was manipulated, this raises questions about who had the means to do it and why. As I note in the WIRED story, there are two obvious possibilities — Russia and Ukraine — both of whom had means and motive, both of whom had access to the Ecocenter server and radiation sensor data. </p><p>It makes sense to consider what occurred from the viewpoint of either scenario, though all we can do is speculate at this point.</p><p>If Russia falsified the data as part of a disinformation campaign, as I discuss in the WIRED story, to bolster its claims that Ukraine was building a dirty bomb at Chernobyl, then it would have made sense if Ukrainian workers at Ecocenter grew alarmed by the spikes and pulled the plug on the server to thwart the disinformation campaign. But once Russian soldiers had control of the Ecocenter facilities, why remove the hard drives? To remove evidence of Russia’s manipulation?</p><p>If Ukraine was responsible for manipulating the data and falsifying the radiation spikes — to alarm the West or control the movement of Russian soldiers at Chernobyl, as I discuss in the WIRED story — the scenario becomes more interesting. If workers at Chernobyl created the spikes, and someone in authority realized the implications of deceiving the IAEA and the public with false data and ordered them to stop, this could explain why the data suddenly stopped transmitting to the IAEA and stopped being updated to the Ecocenter web site. Alternatively, Russia could have realized that Ukraine was falsifying the data to drum up support from Europe and the US by showing that the invasion had created a dangrous nuclear risk and ordered soldiers at Chernobyl to seize the Ecocenter hard drives to halt the Ukrainian disinformation campaign. Who knows?</p><p>Without an investigation, we may never know the truth. </p><p>Shevchuk told me in an email that his agency would consider investigating the radiation spikes if merited, but would do so only after the war has ended. With the Ecocenter hard drives missing, and the unlikelihood that any 2022 data in the memory of the GammaTRACERs would still remain at the end of the war, it’s not clear an investigation would even be possible. </p><p>The mystery of Chernobyl may remain a mystery.</p><p><em>Thank you for reading.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/17/health-ceo-salaries-compensation/">https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/17/health-ceo-salaries-compensation/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37182600">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
	<p><span><span>T</span></span>he health care industry didn’t just provide a safe haven for jittery stock investors in 2022, a year defined by inflation and higher interest rates. It also provided a stable stream of wealth for top executives, who collectively pocketed billions of dollars in what was otherwise a rough patch for the economy.</p>
<p>By almost every measure, 2022 was a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-u-s-stocks-2022-is-a-year-with-almost-no-record-highs-11672443247" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bad year</a> for the stock market. But health care stocks <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/healthcare-stocks-defensive-buy-51672951649" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell significantly less</a> than other companies as the amount of care received and prescriptions filled returned closer to pre-pandemic norms.</p>
<p>As a result, the CEOs of more than 300 publicly traded health care companies combined to make $4 billion in 2022, according to a STAT analysis of financial filings. That amount of money could buy Costco memberships for more than 66 million people, and it’s equivalent to the entire economic output of <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=SL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sierra Leone</a>.</p>
<p>That CEO haul was down 11% from the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/07/18/health-care-ceo-compensation-2021/">$4.5 billion recorded in 2021</a>. But the sizable paydays highlight how every niche of health care — from Covid-19 vaccines and obscure technology to orthopedic implants and providing coverage to the nation’s poor — continued to supply its leaders with substantial sums of money even as more people struggled to afford food, housing, and, yes, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/468053/record-high-put-off-medical-care-due-cost-2022.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">health care</a>.</p>
<p>“No matter how you slice it, the people at the top — the CEOs of these companies — are making enormous gains every year compared to ordinary Americans,” said John McDonough, a health policy professor at Harvard who has studied health care for nearly four decades. “This is the bitter fruit that we reap from telling the health care industry to act more like a business.”</p>
		
		
<p>No CEO made more than Moderna’s Stéphane Bancel, who took in <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/17/moderna-stephane-bancel-compensation/">nearly $400 million</a> after governments around the world quickly bought the biotech company’s Covid-19 shot. Bancel is in the process of donating a vast majority of his income to charities. The 10 highest-paid CEOs — a list that also includes the CEOs of Thermo Fisher and McKesson — made a combined $1.4 billion, or about a third of the total studied. That amount is roughly what the National Institutes of Health spends annually to <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/about-nida/legislative-activities/budget-information/fiscal-year-2024-budget-information-congressional-justification-national-institute-drug-abuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study drug abuse and addiction</a>.</p>
<p>The irony with health care’s massive payouts, according to experts, is how the industry praises itself for attempting to find ways to lower costs. But health care still represents more than 18% of the U.S. economy — similar to what it was before the pandemic.</p>
<p>“Individual companies’ incentive is not to bring system costs down,” McDonough said.</p>
		
		
<p>Similar to last year, STAT analyzed executive compensation found in the annual proxy filings of more than 300 companies across all health care sectors — drugmakers and biotech firms, health insurers, hospitals, other providers, medical device firms, health tech companies, suppliers, and more. The analysis focused on companies that were worth at least $1 billion in March, based on data from financial database provider AlphaSense.</p>
<p>The data offer a detailed view of how top executives are incentivized, like how stock continues to comprise most of their compensation and how that drives the wide pay disparities between those in charge and those who work on the ground, like nurses, home health aides, and others. The analysis also highlights outliers within each sector, such as one biopharma CEO who made more than $90 million — all of which came from so-called “management fees.”</p>

                                  <p>Rachel really hates sitting in traffic. Knowing she's about to spend up to an hour and a half in her car that day staring at taillights in front of her makes it all the more difficult to wake up in the morning.</p><p>She had a remote position over the past few years, but landed a new job in February at a nonprofit, which came with a catch: The job required her to make the hike to its Silver Spring, Maryland, office at least two days a week — forcing her to commute 30 to 45 minutes each way.&nbsp;</p><p>Rachel, who was granted a pseudonym to speak freely about her employer's policy, is among millions of workers getting back into the swing of commuting thanks to return-to-office mandates. Like many of them, Rachel said she doesn't see the point. But it's not just the time suck that bothers her, it's the environmental impact of her new routine.</p><p>"I get kind of furious when I drive to work and see the road choked with traffic," Rachel told me. "It's incredibly harmful to the environment. And offices also generate so much waste, like paper and plastic cups and utensils."&nbsp;</p><p>Rachel's concerns about the environment have been largely ignored in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-making-workers-employees-return-to-office-rto-wfh-hybrid-2023-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">the battle over return-to-office mandates</a> — at least publicly. CEOs at Amazon, Google, and JPMorgan Chase argue that in-person collaboration and random watercooler conversations keep people more engaged. Opponents of the shift have emphasized the ability of workers to be more productive when they set their own schedule. But grappling with the broader planetary effects of these decisions is a failure on the part of corporations, James Elfer, the founder of More Than Now, told me.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's shocking that this isn't part of the conversation, especially at companies that claim to care about sustainability," Elfer, whose firm conducts behavioral-science experiments to improve workplaces, said. "It's a missed opportunity to explore an employer's colossal influence on our behavior."&nbsp;</p><p>Whether mandatory return-to-office policies will make the climate crisis worse is an important question, especially as scientists predict that <a href="https://www.insider.com/summer-2023-heat-wave-tracker-temperature-records-2023-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">2023 will be the hottest year on record</a>. Transportation accounts for about 15% of greenhouse-gas emissions warming the planet, with gas-powered cars, trucks, and buses contributing an outsize amount. But determining whether working from an office is worse for the planet isn't that simple. There are myriad factors that could tip the scales the other way, such as where people live, the amount of energy people use at home, the food they eat, the things they buy, and the extra trips they take. We are in the midst of a major upheaval in how people work, and Fortune 500 companies <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fortune-announces-2022-fortune-500-list-301552608.html#:~:text=The%20revenue%20threshold%20for%202022,employ%2029.7%20million%20people%20worldwide." target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">employ nearly 30 million people around the world</a>. Failing to find a balance between boosting productivity at the office and protecting the planet risks making the crisis worse.</p><p>"Collectively, these decisions mean millions of employees working in profoundly different ways," Elfer said. "The lack of attention feels irresponsible."</p><h2>Commuting cost</h2><p>In the US, the transportation sector belches out the most greenhouse gases of any industry, and <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">passenger vehicles are largely responsible</a>, generating the equivalent of 374 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2021. While all that driving isn't just from commuting, about three-fourths of the 154 million Americans who do travel to work go by car. On average, they spend nearly an hour on the road each day, according to US Census data from 2021. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/transport-statistics-great-britain-2022/transport-statistics-great-britain-2022-domestic-travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">trends are similar in the UK</a>, where cars and taxis account for half of the transportation sector's emissions, and some 68% percent of people who commute to work did so by car for an average travel time of one hour a day.&nbsp;</p><p>So it stands to reason that cutting out commutes would help keep the air cleaner. Ty Colman, a cofounder and the chief revenue officer at Optera, a carbon-accounting firm that helps organizations quantify their emissions, said that in general, a fully remote company with no offices has the lowest impact-per-employee per year, at less than 1 metric ton of carbon-dioxide equivalent. That includes the uptick in energy used to power computers, keep the lights on, and maintain a comfortable temperature at home. Employees with a hybrid-work policy that allows them to be remote three days a week emit about 1.4 metric tons per year, which increases to 1.7 metric tons under a fully in-office policy. The firm's method is based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the most widely used standard among organizations, cities, and countries to track their emissions. The company adjusted a wide array of variables to see how different behaviors affected the amount of emissions per employee, Colman said, and fully in-office always produced the highest emissions unless a large majority of people made their commute by public transit — then a hybrid schedule could actually have a greater environmental impact.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/working-from-home-can-save-energy-and-reduce-emissions-but-how-much" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">International Energy Agency in 2020 found</a> that for people who commute more than 4 miles per day by car, their emissions would decrease if they worked from home. Overall, if people who can telework did so just one day a week, it would cut 24 million metric tons of emissions a year — equivalent to what the Greater London area produces each year. The IEA said that represented a "notable decline" but was small in the context of the amount emissions must drop to meet global climate goals.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><q>"I get kind of furious when I drive to work and see the road choked with traffic. It's incredibly harmful to the environment."</q></blockquote><p>The onset of the pandemic in 2020 provided a real-world opportunity to research what happens when millions of people stop commuting and work from home. Ralf Martin, an associate professor at Imperial College Business School in London, did just that. His team collected smart-meter data from a representative sample of 1,164 UK households and surveyed 452 of them about how their daily patterns changed during July and August 2020. Most people reported a commute of fewer than 20 miles and traveled by car. On average, they worked from home three days a week and commuted two, as some were essential workers and had to go in. Even as people sat at home charging laptops and taking video calls, overall household emissions dropped by 33% — electricity use went up by 6%, while gas consumption decreased by 9.5%. That rise in electricity didn't generate as big a spike in emissions as expected, Martin said, for two reasons: First, demand was more spread out during the day. In the pre-COVID world, household emissions were clustered in the early morning and the evenings, forcing more inefficient oil and gas plants to come online to meet the spikes in demand.</p><p>"During these morning and evening peaks is when energy generation is the dirtiest," Martin said. "The high demand leads to some of the more marginal, dirtier power plants getting switched on so the carbon intensity of the power grid goes up."</p><p>The second factor was a bit more odd: Since people weren't going into the office and spending time around colleagues, they probably care less about hygiene. "It's also possible people didn't shower so much," Martin added. "That's less energy for heating water."&nbsp;</p><p>Even though the study only covered the early part of the pandemic, it illustrated how a shift away from office work can have some positive effects for the planet. But since we are no longer in lockdown, global emissions have rebounded to higher than pre-pandemic levels because people <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/delta-airlines-expects-memorial-day-travel-beat-pre-pandemic-levels-2023-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">are driving and flying again</a>, the IEA said. The added trouble is that many people used the pandemic as a reason to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-gen-z-leaving-cities-for-suburbs-amid-pandemic-2020-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">move to the suburbs</a>. That potentially means longer and more expensive commutes as employers demand people be in the office again — making a strong case for more flexibility to work from home.</p><p>"The bottom line here is that the immediate effect was this big savings in emissions," Martin said. "But what seems to be emerging is a danger that transport emissions are actually increasing as people move further away from their place of work and engage in hybrid working."</p><h2>Keeping the lights on</h2><p>Despite the intuitive nature of the argument, most experts said that sending everyone back to home offices is not a silver bullet for combating the climate crisis. If a person's commute was shorter than 4 miles or they relied on public transportation, the IEA report found, teleworking could actually increase their emissions because of the extra energy used at home. Other behaviors make a difference in this calculation, as well: What time of year is it? During the winter, energy use tends to be higher as people turn on the heat, though in the US it's actually higher in the summer because air conditioning is so common. Are people wasting more food or running their electronic devices unnecessarily? Running more errands? Taking more weekend trips?</p><p>In 2021, More Than Now outlined a road map for how companies could <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/03/is-remote-work-actually-better-for-the-environment" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">determine the optimal mix of commuting and WFH</a> for their employees. The firm's initial research found that employees' net-sustainability impact depended on travel, the energy and digital devices they use, waste management, and local infrastructure.</p><p>"Each was dramatically influenced by remote work and had pros and cons when it comes to our environmental footprint," Elfer said. "There was no clear answer to whether work from home was better or worse for the environment in general terms."</p><blockquote><q>It's shocking that this isn't part of the conversation, especially at companies that claim to care about sustainability</q></blockquote><p>Tailoring people's behavior to ensure that working from home actually cuts emissions can be hard, especially without robust data from employees on how they spend their time. Even without this information, some institutions are encouraging people to be more sustainable at home, including American University in Washington, DC. Megan Litke, the director of sustainability at American, said her office conducts a survey each year of faculty and staff to track their commuting habits. However, they haven't found a way to accurately measure what people are doing at home.</p><p>"We've taken the approach that we don't need a firm number to start taking action on it," Litke said. "We provide people with a list of actions they can do, broken out by morning routine, lunch break, and afternoon stretch."</p><p>A <a href="https://www.american.edu/about/sustainability/get-involved/green-home-guide.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">Green Home Guide suggests</a> people avoid plastic K-Cups for coffee and eat meat- and dairy-free meals to lower their carbon footprint, and it offers tips for recycling, composting, and buying green cleaning products. Energy-saving techniques are also included, such as putting desks near a window to take advantage of daylight and setting electronic devices to go into sleep mode after a certain window of time.</p><p>"It's important to recognize that working from home isn't a perfect environmental solution," Litke said. "We have to think about it holistically."</p><h2>Head in the sand</h2><p>While scientists and experts are trying to find the perfect mix of work-from-home and in-office time to help the planet, CEOs seem less concerned. Many companies — even ones that say <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/climate-crisis-inequality-racial-justice-energy-technology-innovation-2022-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">they are dedicated to helping the planet</a> — don't seem interested in trying to figure out the answer, Efler said. More Than Now published its road map in 2021 in hopes that companies would want to partner to study the trade-offs, but in the two years since his organization started looking into the issue, it's been mostly crickets from the corporate world.</p><p>Operta's Colman said that companies are quietly considering "what emissions will be relative to various work policies." It may not be center stage in the debate because employees' commutes can represent a small portion of a company's overall emissions, Colman said, but Optera, which has clients including Target, Dell, and Williams-Sonoma, has run the numbers for dozens of companies.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the importance of the question at hand and the volume of the environmental promises made by many large corporations, the relative hush when it comes to commutes is perplexing.</p><p>Insider asked Amazon, Apple, Google, and JPMorgan Chase — all of which have ambitious climate goals — whether they considered the potential environmental trade-offs in crafting their return-to-office mandates. All declined to comment or didn't respond<strong>.</strong> In their latest sustainability reports, Amazon, Apple, and Google account for employee commutes in their overall carbon footprint. JPMorgan does not.

While these numbers may seem small, they do add up, and optimizing how employees commute could be an easy win for companies that ostensibly care about the future of the planet.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><q>It's important to recognize that working from home isn't a perfect environmental solution. We have to think about it holistically.</q></blockquote><p>Schneider Electric, which makes hardware and software to manage energy in buildings, is focused on making its own offices as sustainable as possible and offering employees flexibility to work from home. Tony Johnson, the director of hub sites and workplace strategy, said these efforts began around 2015. Since then, Schneider Electric has shrunk its offices from 300 to about 200 in North America.&nbsp;</p><p>"We recognized that not everybody wants or needs to be in the office every day of the week," he said. "At the same time, it's hard to build relationships that drive innovation virtually."&nbsp;</p><p>Schneider asks its 35,000 employees in North America to be in the office at least two days a week and is pursuing electric vehicles for those who regularly drive to meet with customers. The company's <a href="https://www.se.com/ww/en/assets/564/document/396659/2022-sustainability-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">2022 sustainability report shows</a> that emissions from its own offices and manufacturing sites around the world are decreasing, while emissions from employee commuting increased. Both categories account for a small portion of Schneider Electric's overall carbon footprint.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"This is a complicated problem, and we're learning as we go," Johnson said. "Several years ago, no one was talking about how their vendors were impacting the planet. Now, we're trying to make sure our furniture supplier recycles or refurbishes."&nbsp;</p><p>For Rachel, finding another job that is fully remote would be ideal. She already negotiated with her current employer to be in the office two days a week — as opposed to five — and doesn't think they will budge any further. That's left Rachel thinking about the ripple effects of commuting to work — the environmental impact, the weight on her mental health, even the wear and tear on her cars and the roads. For all these reasons, she's determined that going into the office simply isn't worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think we go in because our CEO likes to have people to talk to," she said. "I don't think our presence is generating amazing ideas or networking. My boss just likes a more traditional work environment."</p><hr><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/catherine-boudreau" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Catherine Boudreau</a> is senior sustainability reporter at Insider.&nbsp;</em></p>

</p><div>
<p>In 2021, the Wikimedia Foundation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2021-09-26/News_from_Diff" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2021-09-26/News from Diff">announced</a> the first grants of a "<a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Equity_Fund" title="m:Knowledge Equity Fund">Knowledge Equity Fund</a>" created in June of the previous year. This involved about a million dollars of WMF funds being given, in the form of grants, to a number of external charitable and advocacy organizations.
</p><p>This proved controversial; as we <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2022-10-31/News_and_notes" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2022-10-31/News and notes">covered last October</a>, a "somewhat-viral Twitter thread" questioned the relevance of these organizations to Wikimedia projects and values, and while some of the controversy was certainly political in nature, many of the grant recipients seemed unrelated to Wikimedia projects, prompting further discussion on mailing lists. One concern was the lack of community input into the process that led to the fund's creation. Another was the use of money which was generally solicited on the grounds of being necessary to fund Wikimedia projects, meaning that many donors likely did not know or intend for their funds to be given to unrelated organizations. <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Equity_Fund#Round_1_-_Narrative_and_Financial_reports" title="meta:Knowledge Equity Fund">Two of the grant recipients</a> from the first round seem to have not shared financial reports detailing how the money was spent.
</p><p>The Wikimedia Foundation has <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2023/08/03/announcing-the-second-round-of-grantees-from-the-wikimedia-foundation-knowledge-equity-fund/">announced</a> a second round of grantees this month, saying in its announcement:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Equity – more specifically, knowledge equity – underpins our movement's vision of a world in which every human can share in the sum of all knowledge. It encourages us to consider the knowledge and communities that have been left out of the historical record, both intentionally and unintentionally. This is an important pillar of the Wikimedia movement’s strategic direction, our forward-looking approach to prepare for the Wikimedia of 2030. 
</p><p>There can be many reasons behind these gaps in knowledge, derived from systemic social, political and technical challenges that prevent all people from being able to access and contribute to free knowledge projects like Wikimedia equally. In 2021, the Wikimedia Foundation launched the Knowledge Equity Fund specifically to address gaps in the Wikimedia movement's vision of free knowledge caused by racial bias and discrimination, that have prevented populations around the world from participating equally. The fund is a part of the Wikimedia Foundation’s Annual Plan for the 2023-24 fiscal year to support knowledge equity by supporting regional and thematic strategies, and helping close knowledge gaps. Building on learnings from its first round of grants, today the Equity Fund is welcoming its second round of grantees.
</p><p>This second round includes seven grantees that span four regions, including the Fund's first-ever grantees in Asia. This diverse group of grantees was chosen from an initial pool of 42 nominations, which were received from across the Wikimedia movement through an open survey in 2022 and 2023. Each grantee aligns with one of Fund's five focus areas, identified to address persistent structural barriers that prevent equitable access and participation in open knowledge. They are also recognized nonprofits with a proven track record of impact in their region. The Knowledge Equity Fund was initially conceived in response to global demands for racial equity, and the global reach of these new grantees is testament to and in recognition of the systemic impact of racial inequity in affecting participation in knowledge across the world.

<p>On the subject of financial transparency regarding the Wikimedia Endowment: here is what the <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Endowment/Meetings/January_27,_2022" title="m:Wikimedia Endowment/Meetings/January 27, 2022">minutes of the January 2022</a> board meeting had to say about it. Not exactly a wealth of detail, but we do at least get a financial summary:
</p>
<blockquote><p><b>8) Fundraising update</b>
</p><ul><li>Overview, lead by Caitlin Virtue</li>
<li>Review of Fundraising Report, lead by Amy Parker</li>
<li>Summary: As of December 31, 2021, the Endowment held $105.4 million. There is currently $99.33 million in the investment account and $6.07 million in cash. An additional $8 million raised in December will be transferred to the Endowment in January 2022.</li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This summary was the last time the Endowment Board meeting minutes contained a dollar figure for the Endowment's total value (cash plus investments). Requests for an updated figure in February <span><a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Wikimedia_Endowment&amp;oldid=25284029#January_2023_board_meeting">remained unanswered in July</a></span>. 
</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, the Wikimedia Foundation's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JAntonio_(WMF)" title="User:JAntonio (WMF)">Jayde Antonio</a> <span><a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikimedia_Endowment/Meetings/January_19,_2023&amp;oldid=24524042">posted</a></span> the approved minutes for the January 19, 2023 Endowment Board meeting to the its page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-Wiki" title="Meta-Wiki">Meta</a>. Noticeable here is the lack of any substantial new information – apart from noting the approval of the Endowment grants which were <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2023/04/13/launching-the-first-grants-from-the-wikimedia-endowment-to-support-technical-innovation-in-wikimedia-projects/">announced publicly back in April</a>, they essentially just repeat the boilerplate meeting agenda posted months ago. 
</p><p>For example, the meeting's <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Endowment/Meetings/January_19,_2023#Agenda" title="meta:Wikimedia Endowment/Meetings/January 19, 2023">agenda</a> (posted in February 2023) contained the following item:
</p>
<blockquote><p>6:25 - 6:55 pm UTC: Fundraising Update (Board Chair, Jimmy Wales and Endowment Director, Amy Parker)
</p><ul><li>FY22-23 year to date update</li>
<li>Campaign strategy</li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Endowment/Meetings/January_19,_2023#Minutes" title="meta:Wikimedia Endowment/Meetings/January 19, 2023">minutes</a> approved by the Endowment's board, led by Jimbo Wales, repeated the same point almost verbatim when they were added in July:
</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Fundraising Update</b> (Amy Parker)
</p><ul><li>FY22-23 year to date update</li>
<li>Presentation of campaign strategy</li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Following a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:PermanentLink/1169861874#Endowment" title="Special:PermanentLink/1169861874">query</a> on his user talk page about the Endowment's apparent secrecy, Jimbo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1169793872" title="Special:Diff/1169793872">appeared to criticize</a> the minutes approved by him and his board:
</p>
<blockquote><p>At the meeting we discussed, to universal agreement, that we should publish more information and more often [...] the discussion about publishing more information and more often came about in no small part because the January minutes were something that I felt were not good enough in terms of being open and informative. (A financial report is forthccoming – I haven't seen it yet – but delayed because the relevant person creating it has taken a bit of family leave.)
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a strange comment, as it would seem entirely within the power of the board to determine what information the minutes of its own meetings should contain. He later clarified: "The minutes of the previous board meetings are not written in realtime in the board meeting. They are a legal document prepared in advance and reviewed by the legal team and staff."
</p><p>Following that discussion, however, Wales did provide a <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Wikimedia_Endowment#Update_on_endowment" title="m:Talk:Wikimedia Endowment">more meaningful update on Meta-Wiki</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>In official business, the Board moved to hire KPMG as our independent auditor for the new entity, approved a spending policy for the Endowment, approved an operational budget of $2.09 million, and approved a grantmaking budget of $2.91 million for FY 2023-24.  We also set the target of $11.5 million in revenue between fundraising and investment income this fiscal year. We ended the last fiscal year with $118 million in the Wikimedia Endowment and are projecting to grow the corpus by approximately $6.5 million depending on market performance and after expenses.
</p></blockquote>
<p>How much of this $118 million is held by the Tides Foundation, and how much by the new 501(c)(3) organization, is unknown. The Wikimedia Foundation has been keen to emphasize that the Endowment is now a transparent 501(c)(3) non-profit, fulfilling a promise first made in 2017, but the Endowment website itself continues to say:
</p>
<blockquote><p>The Endowment has been established, with an initial contribution by Wikimedia Foundation, as a Collective Action Fund at Tides Foundation (Tax ID# 51-0198509).
</p></blockquote>
<p>Jimmy Wales also uploaded a <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikimedia_Endowment_2023-24_Plan_-_2023-08-12_release_date.pdf" title="m:File:Wikimedia Endowment 2023-24 Plan - 2023-08-12 release date.pdf">document</a> to Meta-Wiki titled "Wikimedia Endowment 2023-24 Plan". This provides information on fundraising goals, an operational timeline, and the Endowment's budget for 2023–2024. It <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AWikimedia_Endowment_2023-24_Plan_-_2023-08-12_release_date.pdf&amp;page=11">mentions</a> $1.8 million in annual expenses in the most recent financial year (similar to the figure mentioned in the <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Endowment/Meetings/July_21,_2022" title="m:Wikimedia Endowment/Meetings/July 21, 2022">minutes for the July 2022 board meeting</a>), including $400,000 for unspecified professional services. It envisages the Endowment standing at $130.4 million by the end of the 2023–2024 fiscal year. 
</p><p>Even with the information now provided, the Wikimedia Endowment has never published a statement detailing its revenue and expenses for any year of its existence. Its actual receipts and spending from 2016 to the present day, including the fees paid to Tides, are completely opaque. The Wikimedia Endowment, the Wikimedia movement's richest affiliate, remains some way away from delivering the level of transparency ordinarily expected of Wikimedia affiliates.

<p>The Wikimedia Foundation has <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2023/08/07/wikifunctions-is-starting-up/">announced</a> that after three years of development, its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikifunctions" title="Wikifunctions">Wikifunctions</a> project is slowly beginning to roll out.
</p>
<blockquote><p>Wikifunctions, the newest Wikimedia project, is a new space to collaboratively create and maintain a library of functions. You can think of these functions like recipes for a meal—they take inputs and produce an output (a reliable answer). You might have experienced something similar when using a search engine to find the distance between two locations, the volume of an object, converting two units, and more.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The announcement describes Wikifunctions as "a core component of the larger" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Wikipedia" title="Abstract Wikipedia">Abstract Wikipedia</a>, a project designed to have volunteers writing simple Wikipedia articles in code that can then be translated into human languages. Both projects are spearheaded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_Vrande%C4%8Di%C4%87" title="Denny Vrandečić">Denny Vrandečić</a>, the former project lead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikidata" title="Wikidata">Wikidata</a> and a past Google employee. You can learn more about how Wikifunctions works in this short video on <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikifunctions_in_7_minutes.webm" title="commons:File:Wikifunctions in 7 minutes.webm">Commons</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHy63VOp0RQ">YouTube</a>.
</p><p>A technical evaluation published in December 2022 had criticized this "decision to make Abstract Wikipedia depend on Wikifunctions, a new programming language and runtime environment, invented by the Abstract Wikipedia team, with design goals that exceed the scope of Abstract Wikipedia itself, and architectural issues that are incompatible with the standards of correctness, performance, and usability that Abstract Wikipedia requires." However, Vrandečić's team disputed such criticisms and rejected the evaluation's recommendations, which had included decoupling Wikifunctions from Abstract Wikipedia, and having it based on the existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lua" title="Wikipedia:Lua">Lua</a> programming language that is already integrated into MediaWiki and widely used by Wikipedia editors (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2023-01-01/Technology_report" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2023-01-01/Technology report">detailed <i>Signpost</i> coverage</a>).

</figure><p>From wilting saguaros in Arizona and hot-tub-like temperatures off the coast of Florida to increased heat-related hospitalizations in Europe and agricultural losses in China, last month felt unusually hot. It was: several teams have now confirmed that July 2023 was the hottest month in recorded history. And there’s more to come.</p><p>July is typically the hottest month of the year, and this July shattered records going back as far as 1850 by around 0.25 °C. Overall, the average global temperature was 1.54 °C above the preindustrial average for July, according to Berkeley Earth, a non-profit group in California that is one of several organizations tracking global warming. It’s a seemingly small increase, but what many people across the world actually experienced was a bout of long and often <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02233-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02233-0" data-track-category="body text link">brutal heat waves</a>.</p><p>“We’re in a particularly extreme period on top of a long-term warming trend, and the view from the top is a little scary,” says Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth.</p><h2>Loading the dice</h2><p>Multiple factors might have played a small part in the record-breaking temperatures, including a budding El Niño warming event in the equatorial Pacific Ocean and a volcanic eruption last year on the island of Tonga that injected water vapour, itself a powerful greenhouse gas, into the stratosphere. New regulations have also curbed the release of sulphur dioxide pollution from ships, which tends to have a cooling effect. But the biggest driver by far, scientists say, is increasing <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02233-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02233-0" data-track-category="body text link">greenhouse-gas concentrations</a> in the atmosphere, which have been steadily raising average global temperatures and have loaded the dice in favour of extreme weather and climate events (see ‘Going up’).</p><figure>

</figure><p>An analysis by scientists at the World Weather Attribution initiative found that the heatwave in China last month would have been expected only <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/extreme-heat-in-north-america-europe-and-china-in-july-2023-made-much-more-likely-by-climate-change/" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/extreme-heat-in-north-america-europe-and-china-in-july-2023-made-much-more-likely-by-climate-change/" data-track-category="body text link">once every 250 years in a world without human influence</a>. Temperatures in southern Europe and North America, meanwhile, would have been “virtually impossible” in the preindustrial era. But such extremes are becoming the norm: last month’s events can now be expected every 5–15 years, and could happen as often as every 2–5 years if global temperatures increase to 2 °C above preindustrial levels, the upper limit imposed by the 2015 Paris climate agreement.</p><p>“It only takes a small change in average temperature for the frequency of extremes to completely blow out, which is what we’ve seen in the Northern Hemisphere recently,” says Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.</p><h2>Local troubles</h2><p>Global average temperature, often measured on a rolling ten-year basis, is a metric that scientists use to track broad trends in a noisy, complex system. Thus far, the world has warmed by 1.14 °C using that metric. But no one actually lives in an average world. And although 90% of the excess heat due to the presence of greenhouse gases has gone into the oceans, the fact is that temperatures over land are both warmer and rising faster than those of the ocean surface. Many parts of the Earth’s land surface have already warmed by more than 1.5 °C in at least one season, and temperatures in numerous places last month were as much as 8 °C above the average for July (see ‘Hot spots’).</p><figure>

</figure><p>To some extent, this should come as no surprise. The Paris agreement limits of 1.5–2 °C were intended to establish a relatively safe zone that, if maintained, would prevent many of the most severe impacts of a warming world. But a key message from the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/" data-track-category="body text link">2021–22 assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> is that every tenth of a degree of warming at the global level comes with additional — and often extreme — impacts at the local and regional level.</p><p>A few decades ago, many of those impacts were theoretical, but a growing body of research suggests that the planet is beginning to breach important ecological thresholds, says Jofre Carnicer, an ecologist at the University of Barcelona in Spain. Carnicer says that temperature and precipitation trends are already pushing many parts of Europe into entirely new fire regimes, evidenced by extreme wildfires in Greece and elsewhere this year<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><h2>Heat waves rising</h2><p>Global temperature trends have tracked fairly well with projections from climate models going back more than two decades, but research into what that means at the local level is just beginning, Carnicer says (see ‘Heatwave projections’). “This is really new science,” he says, and it suggests that even the low threshold of a 1.5 °C average — which could be breached for the first time in the next several years — might be a significant challenge for the world.</p><figure>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    
<p><u>CeCe Moore, an</u> actress and director-turned-genetic genealogist, stood behind a lectern at New Jersey’s Ramapo College in late July. Propelled onto the national stage by the popular PBS show “<a href="https://www.pbs.org/weta/finding-your-roots">Finding Your Roots</a>,” Moore was delivering the keynote address for the inaugural conference of forensic genetic genealogists at Ramapo, one of only two institutions of higher education in the U.S. that offer instruction in the field. It was a new era, Moore told the audience, a turning point for solving crime, and they were in on the ground floor. “We’ve created this tool that can accomplish so much,” she said.</p>



<p>Genealogists like Moore hunt for relatives and build family trees just as traditional genealogists do, but with a twist: They work with law enforcement agencies and use commercial DNA databases to search for people who can help them identify unknown human remains or perpetrators who left DNA at a crime scene.</p>



<p>The field exploded in 2018 after the <a href="https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/local/communities/ventura/2018/04/26/golden-state-killer-joseph-deangelo-dna-ventura-double-homicide/554069002/">arrest</a> of Joseph James DeAngelo as the notorious Golden State Killer, responsible for more than a dozen murders across California. DNA evidence collected from a 1980 double murder was analyzed and uploaded to a commercial database; a hit to a distant relative helped a genetic genealogist build an elaborate family tree that ultimately coalesced on DeAngelo. Since then, <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/jcycgvhm96/1">hundreds</a> of cold cases have been solved using the technique. Moore, among the field’s biggest evangelists, boasts of having personally helped close more than 200 cases.</p>



<p>The practice is not without controversy. It involves combing through the genetic information of hundreds of thousands of innocent people in search of a perpetrator. And its practitioners operate without meaningful guardrails, save for “interim” guidance <a href="https://www.justice.gov/olp/page/file/1204386/download">published</a> by the Department of Justice in 2019.</p>



<p>The last five years have been like the “Wild West,” Moore acknowledged, but she was proud to be among the founding members of the <a href="https://www.iggab.org/">Investigative Genetic Genealogy Accreditation Board</a>, which is developing professional standards for practitioners. “With this incredibly powerful tool comes immense responsibility,” she solemnly told the audience. The practice relies on public trust to convince people not only to upload their private genetic information to commercial databases, but also to allow police to rifle through that information. If you’re doing something you wouldn’t want blasted on the front page of the New York Times, Moore said, you should probably rethink what you’re doing. “If we lose public trust, we will lose this tool.” </p>



<p>Despite those words of caution, Moore is one of several high-profile genetic genealogists who exploited a loophole in a commercial database called GEDmatch, allowing them to search the DNA of individuals who explicitly opted out of sharing their genetic information with police.</p>

<p>The loophole, which a source demonstrated for The Intercept, allows genealogists working with police to manipulate search fields within a DNA comparison tool to trick the system into showing opted-out profiles. In records of communications reviewed by The Intercept, Moore and two other forensic genetic genealogists discussed the loophole and how to trigger it. In a separate communication, one of the genealogists described hiding the fact that her organization had made an identification using an opted-out profile.</p>



<p>The communications are a disturbing example of how genetic genealogists and their law enforcement partners, in their zeal to close criminal cases, skirt privacy rules put in place by DNA database companies to protect their customers. How common these practices are remains unknown, in part because police and prosecutors have fought to keep details of genetic investigations from being turned over to criminal defendants. As commercial DNA databases grow, and the use of forensic genetic genealogy as a crime-fighting tool expands, experts say the genetic privacy of millions of Americans is in jeopardy.</p>



<p>Moore did not respond to The Intercept’s requests for comment.</p>

<p>To Tiffany Roy, a DNA expert and lawyer, the fact that genetic genealogists have accessed private profiles — while simultaneously preaching about ethics — is troubling. “If we can’t trust these practitioners, we certainly cannot trust law enforcement,” she said. “These investigations have serious consequences; they involve people who have never been suspected of a crime.” At the very least, law enforcement actors should have a warrant to conduct a genetic genealogy search, she said. “Anything less is a serious violation of privacy.”</p>

<h2 id="h-the-wild-west">The Wild West</h2>



<p>Forensic genetic genealogy evolved from the direct-to-consumer DNA testing craze that took hold roughly a decade ago. Companies like 23andMe and Ancestry offered DNA analysis and a database where results could be uploaded and searched against millions of other profiles, offering consumers a powerful new tool to dig into their heritage through genetics.</p>



<p>It wasn’t long before entrepreneurial genealogists realized this information could also be used to solve criminal cases, especially those that had gone cold. While the arrest of the Golden State Killer captured national attention, it was not the first case solved by forensic genetic genealogy. Two weeks earlier, genetic genealogists Margaret Press and Colleen Fitzpatrick joined officials in Ohio to <a href="https://www.limaohio.com/top-stories/2018/04/16/buckskin-girl-identified/">announce</a> that “groundbreaking work” had allowed authorities to identify a young woman whose body was found by the side of a road back in 1981. Formerly known as “Buckskin Girl” for the handmade pullover she wore, Marcia King was given her name back through genetic genealogy. “Everyone said it couldn’t be done,” Press <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYTI1zvfCfk">said</a>.</p>



<!-- BLOCK(cta)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) -->

<!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[3] -->



<p>The type of consumer DNA information used in forensic genetic genealogy is far different from that uploaded to the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/dna-fingerprint-act-of-2005-expungement-policy/codis-and-ndis-fact-sheet">Combined DNA Index System</a>, or CODIS, a decades-old network administered by the FBI. The DNA entered in CODIS comes from individuals convicted of or arrested for serious crimes and is often referred to as “junk” DNA: short pieces of unique genetic code that don’t carry any individual health or trait information. “It’s not telling us how the person looks. It’s not telling us about their heritage or their phenotypic traits,” Roy said. “It’s a string of numbers, like a telephone number.”</p>



<p>In contrast, the DNA testing offered by direct-to-consumer companies is “as sensitive as it gets,” Roy said. “It tells you about your origins. It tells you about your relatives and your parentage, and it tells you about your disease propensity.” And it has serious reach: While CODIS searches the DNA of people already identified by the criminal justice system, the commercial databases have the potential to search through the DNA of everyone else.</p>



<p>Individuals can upload their test results to any number of databases; at present, there are five main commercial portals. Ancestry and 23andMe are the biggest players in the field, with databases containing roughly 23 million and 14 million profiles. Individuals must test with the companies to gain access to their databases; neither allow DNA results obtained from a different testing service. Both <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/c/legal/privacystatement#:~:text=We%20do%20not%20allow%20law,the%20law%20from%20doing%20so.">Ancestry</a> and <a href="https://www.23andme.com/privacy/">23andMe</a> forbid police, and the genetic genealogists who work with them, from accessing their data for crime-fighting purposes. “We do not allow law enforcement to use Ancestry’s service to investigate crimes or to identify human remains” absent a valid court order, Ancestry’s privacy policy notes. The two companies provide regular <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/c/transparency">transparency</a> reports <a href="https://www.23andme.com/transparency-report/">documenting</a> law enforcement requests for user information.</p>



<p>MyHeritage, home to some 7 million DNA profiles, similarly bars law enforcement searches, but it does allow individuals to upload DNA results obtained from other sources.</p>



<p>And then there are <a href="https://www.familytreedna.com/">FamilyTreeDNA</a> and <a href="https://www.gedmatch.com/about/">GEDmatch</a>, which grant police access but give users the choice of opting in or out. Both allow anyone to upload their DNA results and have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/genetic-genealogy-nonprofit-dna-database/">upward</a> of 1.8 million profiles. But neither company routinely publicizes the number of customers who have opted in, said Leah Larkin, a veteran genetic genealogist and privacy advocate from California. Larkin writes about issues in the field — including forensic genetic genealogy, which she does not practice — on her website <a href="https://thednageek.com/">the DNA Geek</a>. Larkin estimates that roughly 700,000 GEDmatch profiles are opted in. She suspects that even more are opted in on FamilyTreeDNA; opting in is the default for the company’s U.S. customers and “it’s not obvious how to opt out.”</p>



<p>But even opting out of law enforcement searches doesn’t guarantee that a profile won’t be accessed: A loophole in GEDmatch offers users working with law enforcement agencies a back door to accessing protected profiles. A source showed The Intercept how to exploit the loophole; it was not an obvious weakness or one that could be triggered mistakenly. Rather, it was a back door that required experience with the platform’s various tools to open.</p>



<p>GEDmatch’s parent company, Verogen, did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<h2 id="h-an-open-secret">An Open Secret</h2>



<p>In forensic genetic genealogy circles, the GEDmatch loophole had long been an open secret, sources told The Intercept, one that finally surfaced publicly during the Ramapo College conference in late July.</p>



<p>Roy, the DNA expert, was giving a presentation titled “In the Hot Seat,” a primer for genealogists on what to expect if called to testify in a criminal case. There was a clear and simple theme: “Do not lie,” Roy said. “The minute you’re caught in a lie is the minute that it’s going to be difficult for people to use your work.”</p>



<p>As part of the session, David Gurney, a professor of law and society at Ramapo and director of the <a href="https://www.forensicmag.com/592484-NJ-College-Launches-World-s-First-Investigative-Genetic-Genealogy-Center/">college’s</a> nascent <a href="https://www.ramapo.edu/igg/">Investigative Genetic Genealogy Center</a>, joined Roy for a mock questioning of Cairenn Binder, a genealogist who heads up the center’s <a href="https://www.ramapo.edu/igg/certificate-program/">certificate program</a>.</p>



<p>Gurney, simulating direct examination, walked Binder through a series of friendly questions. Did she have access to DNA evidence or genetic code during her investigations? No, she replied. Could she see everyone who’d uploaded DNA to the databases? No, she said, only those who’d opted in to law enforcement searches.</p>



<p>Roy, playing the part of opposing counsel, was pointed in her cross-examination: Was Binder aware of the GEDmatch loophole? And had she used it? Yes, Binder said. “How many times?” Roy asked.</p>



<p>“A handful,” Binder replied. “Maybe up to a dozen.”</p>



<p>Binder’s answers quickly made their way into a private Facebook group for genetic genealogy enthusiasts, prompting a response from the DNA Doe Project, a volunteer-driven organization led by Press, one of the women who identified the Buckskin Girl. Before joining Ramapo College, Binder had worked for the DNA Doe Project.</p>



<p>In a statement posted to the Facebook group, Pam Lauritzen, the project’s communications director, said the loophole was an artifact of changes GEDmatch implemented in 2019, when it made opting out the default for all profiles. “While we knew that the intent of the change was to make opted-out users unavailable, some volunteers with the DNA Doe Project continued to use the reports that allowed access to profiles that were opted out,” she wrote. That use was neither “encouraged nor discouraged,” she continued. Still, she claimed the access was somehow “in compliance” with GEDmatch’s terms of service — which at the time promised that DNA uploaded for law enforcement purposes would only be matched with customers who’d opted in — and that the loophole was closed “years ago.”</p>



<p>It was a curious statement, particularly given that Press, the group’s co-founder, was among the genealogists who discussed the GEDmatch loophole in communications reviewed by The Intercept. In 2020, she described the DNA Doe Project using an opted-out profile to make an identification — and devising a way to keep that quiet.</p>



<p>Press referred The Intercept’s questions to the DNA Doe Project, which declined to comment.</p>



<p>In July 2020, GEDmatch was hacked, which resulted in all 1.45 million profiles then contained in the database to be briefly opted in to law enforcement matching; at the time, BuzzFeed News <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/hackers-gedmatch-dna-privacy">reported</a>, just 280,000 profiles had opted in. GEDmatch was taken offline “until such time that we can be absolutely sure that user data is protected against potential attacks,” Verogen <a href="https://www.facebook.com/officialGEDmatch/posts/226701508802584">wrote</a> on Facebook.</p>



<p>In the wake of the hack, a genetic genealogist named Joan Hanlon was asked by Verogen to beta test a new version of the site. According to records of a conversation reviewed by The Intercept, Press and Moore, the featured speaker at the Ramapo conference, discussed with Hanlon their tricks to access opted-out profiles and whether the new website had plugged all backdoor access. It hadn’t. It’s unclear if anyone told Verogen; as of this month, the back door was still open.</p>



<p>Hanlon did not respond to The Intercept’s requests for comment.</p>



<p>In January 2021, GEDmatch changed its terms of service to opt everyone in for searches involving unidentified human remains, making the back door irrelevant for genealogists who only worked on Doe cases, but not those working with authorities to identify perpetrators of violent crimes.<br></p>



<h2 id="h-undisclosed-methods">Undisclosed Methods</h2>



<p>Exploitation of the GEDmatch loophole isn’t the only example of genetic genealogists and their law enforcement partners playing fast and loose with the rules.</p>



<p>Law enforcement officers have used genetic genealogy to solve crimes that aren’t eligible for genetic investigation per company terms of service and Justice Department guidelines, which say the practice should be reserved for violent crimes like rape and murder only when all other “reasonable” avenues of investigation have failed. In May, CNN <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/09/australia/australia-william-leslie-arnold-cold-case-intl-hnk-dst/index.html">reported</a> on a U.S. marshal who used genetic genealogy to solve a decades-old prison break in Nebraska. There is no prison break exception to the eligibility rules, Larkin noted in a <a href="https://thednageek.com/rules-we-dont-need-no-stinkin-rules/">post</a> on her website. “This case should never have used forensic genetic genealogy in the first place.”</p>



<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[5](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[5] -->“This case should never have used forensic genetic genealogy in the first place.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[5] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[5] -->



<p>A month later, Larkin wrote about another violation, this time in a California case. The FBI and the Riverside County Regional Cold Case Homicide Team had identified the victim of a 1996 homicide using the MyHeritage database — an explicit violation of the company’s terms of service, which <a href="https://mobileapi.myheritage.com/terms-and-conditions">make clear</a> that using the database for law enforcement purposes is “strictly prohibited” absent a court order.</p>



<p>“The case presents an example of ‘noble cause bias,’” Larkin <a href="https://thednageek.com/noble-cause-no-rules/">wrote</a>, “in which the investigators seem to feel that their objective is so worthy that they can break the rules in place to protect others.”</p>



<p>MyHeritage did not respond to a request for comment. The Riverside County Sheriff’s Office referred questions to the Riverside district attorney’s office, which declined to comment on an ongoing investigation. The FBI also declined to comment.</p>



<p>Violations have even come from inside the DNA testing companies. Back in 2019, GEDmatch co-founder Curtis Rogers unilaterally made an exception to the terms of service, without notifying the site’s users, to allow police to search for someone suspected of assault in Utah. It was a tough call, Rogers <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/genetic-genealogy-parabon-gedmatch-assault">told</a> BuzzFeed News, but the case in question “was as close to a homicide as you can get.”</p>



<p>It appears that violations have also spread to Ancestry, which prohibits the use of its DNA data for law enforcement purposes unless the company is legally compelled to provide access. Genetic genealogists told The Intercept that they are aware of examples in which genealogists working with police have provided AncestryDNA testing kits to the possible relatives of suspects — what’s known as “target testing” — or asked customers for access to preexisting accounts as a way to unlock the off-limits data.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for Ancestry did not answer The Intercept’s questions about efforts to unlock DNA data for law enforcement purposes via a third party. Instead, in a statement, the company reiterated its commitment to maintaining the privacy of its users. “Protecting our customers’ privacy and being good stewards of their data is Ancestry’s highest priority,” it read. The company did not respond to follow-up questions.</p>



<p>As it turns out, the genetic genealogy work in the Golden State Killer case was also questionable: The break that led to DeAngelo came after genealogist Barbara Rae-Venter uploaded DNA from the double murder to MyHeritage, according to the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-08/man-in-the-window">Los Angeles Times</a>. Rae-Venter told the Times that she didn’t notify the company about what she was doing but that her actions were approved by Steve Kramer, the FBI’s Los Angeles division counsel at the time. “In his opinion, law enforcement is entitled to go where the public goes,” Rae-Venter told the paper.</p>



<p>Just how prevalent these practices are may never fully be known, in part because police and prosecutors regularly seek to shield genetic investigations from being vetted in court. They argue that what they obtain from forensic genetic genealogy is merely a tip, like information provided by an informant, and is exempt from disclosure to criminal defendants.</p>



<p>That’s exactly what’s happening in Idaho, where Bryan Kohberger is awaiting trial for the 2022 <a href="https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/crime/article275698001.html">murder</a> of four university students. <a href="https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/crime/article276611776.html">For months</a>, the state failed to disclose that it had used forensic genetic genealogy to identify Kohberger as a suspect. A probable cause <a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/isc.coi/CR29-22-2805/122922+Affidavit+-+Exhibit+A+-+Statement+of+Brett-Payne.pdf">statement</a> methodically laying out the evidence that led cops to his door conspicuously omitted any mention of genetic genealogy. Kohberger’s defense team has asked to see documents related to the genealogy work as it prepares for an October trial, but the state has refused, saying the defense has no right to any information about the genetic genealogy it used to crack the case.</p>



<p>Prosecutors said it was the FBI that did the genetic genealogy work, and few records were created in the process, leaving little to turn over. But the state also <a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/isc.coi/CR29-22-2805/061623+States+Motion+for+Protective+Order.pdf">argued</a> that it couldn’t turn over information because the family tree the FBI created was extensive — including “the names and personal information of … hundreds of innocent relatives” — and the privacy of those individuals needed to be maintained. According to the state, it shouldn’t even have to say which genetic database — or databases — it used.</p>



<p>Kohberger’s attorneys argue that the state’s position is preposterous and keeps them from ensuring that the work undertaken to find Kohberger was above board. “It would appear that the state is acknowledging that the companies are providing personal information to the state and that those companies and the government would suffer if the public were to realize it,” one of Kohberger’s attorneys <a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/isc.coi/CR29-22-2805/062323+Objection+to+States+Motion+for+Protective+Order.pdf">wrote</a>. “The statement by the government implies that the databases searched may be ones that law enforcement is specifically barred from, which explains why they do not want to disclose their methods.”</p>



<p>A hearing on the issue is scheduled for August 18.</p>

<h2>“A Search of All of Us”</h2>



<p>Natalie Ram, a law professor at the University of Maryland Carey School of Law and an expert in genetic privacy, believes forensic genetic genealogy is a giant fishing expedition that fails the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment: that law enforcement searches be targeted and based on individualized suspicion. Finding a match to crime scene DNA by searching through millions of genetic profiles is the opposite of targeted. Forensic genetic genealogy, according to Ram, “is fundamentally a search of all of us every time they do it.”</p>



<p>While proponents of forensic genetic genealogy say the individuals they’re searching have willingly uploaded their genetic information and opted in to law enforcement access, Ram and others aren’t so sure that’s the case, even when practitioners adhere to terms of service. If the consent is truly informed and voluntary, “then I think that it would be ethical, lawful, permissible for law enforcement to use that DNA … to identify those individuals who did the volunteering,” Ram said. But that’s not who is being identified in these cases. Instead, it’s relatives — and sometimes very distant relatives. “Our genetic associations are involuntary. They’re profoundly involuntary. They’re involuntary in a way that almost nothing else is. And they’re also immutable,” she said. “I can estrange myself from my family and my siblings and deprive them of information about what I’m doing in my life. And yet their DNA is informative on me.”</p>



<p>Jennifer Lynch, general counsel at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, agrees. “We’re putting other people’s privacy on the line when we’re trying to upload our own genetic information,” she said. “You can’t consent for another person. And there’s just not an argument that you have consented for your genetic information to be in a database when it’s your brother who’s uploaded the information, or when it’s somebody you don’t even know who is related to you.”</p>

<p>To date, efforts to rein in the practice as a violation of the Fourth Amendment have presented some problems. A person whose arrest was built on a foundation of genetic genealogy, for example, might have been harmed by the genealogical fishing expedition but lack standing to bring a case; in the strictest sense, it wasn’t their DNA that was searched. In contrast, a third cousin whose DNA was used to identify a suspect could have standing to bring a suit, but they might be hard-pressed to prove they were harmed by the search.</p>



<p>If police are getting hits to suspects by violating companies’ terms of service — using databases that bar police searching — that “raises some serious Fourth Amendment questions” because no expectation of privacy has been waived, Ram said. Of course, ferreting out such violations would require that the information be disclosed in court, which isn’t happening.</p>



<p>At present, the only real regulators of the practice are the database owners: private companies that can change hands or terms of service with little notice. GEDmatch, which has at least once bent its terms to accommodate police, was started by two genealogy hobbyists and then sold to the biotech company Verogen, which in turn was acquired last winter by another biotech company, Qiagen. Experts like Ram and Lynch worry about the implications of so much sensitive information held in for-profit hands — and readily exploited by police. The “platforms right now are the most powerful regulators we have for most Americans,” Ram said. Police regulate “after a fashion, in a fashion, by what they do. They tell us what they’re willing to do by what they actually do,” she added. “But by the way, that’s like law enforcement making rules for itself, so not exactly a diverse group of stakeholders.”</p>



<p>For now, Ram said, the best way to regulate forensic genetic genealogy is by statute. In 2021, Maryland lawmakers passed a <a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2021RS/chapters_noln/Ch_681_hb0240E.pdf">comprehensive law</a> to restrain the practice. It requires police to obtain a warrant before conducting a genetic genealogy search — certifying that the case is an eligible violent felony and that all other reasonable avenues of investigation have failed — and notify the court before gathering DNA evidence to confirm the suspect identified via genetic genealogy is, in fact, the likely perpetrator. Currently, police use surreptitious methods to collect DNA without judicial oversight: mining a person’s garbage, for example, for items expected to contain biological evidence. In the Golden State Killer case, DeAngelo was implicated by DNA on a discarded tissue.</p>



<p>The Maryland law also requires police to obtain consent from any third party whose DNA might help solve a crime. In the Kohberger case, police searched his parents’ garbage, <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/01/bryan-kohberger-university-idaho-murders-forensic-genealogy.html">collecting trash</a> with DNA on it that the lab believed belonged to Kohberger’s father. In a notorious Florida case, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/they-lied-us-mom-says-police-deceived-her-get-her-n1140696">police lied</a> to a suspect’s parents to get a DNA sample from the mother, telling her they were trying to identify a person found dead whom they believed was her relative. Those methods are barred under the Maryland law.</p>



<p><a href="https://leg.mt.gov/bills/2021/billhtml/HB0602.htm">Montana</a> and <a href="https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title53/Chapter10/53-10-S403.7.html?v=C53-10-S403.7_2023050320230503">Utah</a> have also passed laws governing forensic genetic genealogy, though neither is as strict as Maryland’s.</p>

<h2>Solving Crime Before It Happens</h2>



<p>The rise of direct-to-consumer DNA testing and forensic genetic genealogy raises another issue: the looming reality of a de facto national DNA database that can identify large swaths of the U.S. population, regardless of whether those individuals have uploaded their genetic information. In 2018, researchers led by the former chief science officer at MyHeritage <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau4832">predicted</a> that a database of roughly 3 million people could identify nearly 100 percent of U.S. citizens of European descent. “Such a database scale is foreseeable for some third-party websites in the near future,” they concluded.</p>

<p>“All of a sudden, we have a national DNA database,” said Lynch, “and we didn’t ever have any kind of debate about whether we wanted that in our society.” A national database in “private hands,” she added.</p>



<p>By the time people started worrying about this as a policy issue, it was “too late,” Moore said during her address at the Ramapo conference. “By the time the vast majority of the public learned about genetic genealogy, we’d been quietly building this incredibly powerful tool for human identification behind the scenes,” she said. “People sort of laughed, like, ‘Oh, hobbyists … you do your genealogy, you do your adoption,’ and we were allowed to build this tool without interference.”</p>



<p>Moore advocated for involving forensic genetic genealogy earlier in the investigative process. Doing so, she argued, could focus police on guilty parties more quickly and save innocent people from needless law enforcement scrutiny. In fact, she told the audience, she believes that forensic genetic genealogy can help to eradicate crime. “We can stop criminals in their tracks,” she said. “I really believe we can stop serial killers from existing, stop serial rapists from existing.”</p>



<p>“We are an army. We can do this! So repeat after me,” Moore said, before leading the audience in a chant. “No more serial killers!”</p>



<p><strong>Update: August 18, 2023, 3:55 p.m. ET</strong></p>



<p><em>After this article was published, Margaret Press, founder of the DNA Doe Project, released a <a href="https://dnadoeproject.org/statement-from-Margaret-Press/">statement</a> in response to The Intercept’s findings. Press acknowledged that between May 2019 and January 2021, the organization’s leadership and volunteers made use of GEDmatch tools that provided access to DNA profiles that were opted out of law enforcement searches, which she described as “a bug in the software.” Press stated:</em></p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>We have always been committed to abide by the Terms of Service for the databases we used, and take our responsibility to our law enforcement and medical examiner partner agencies extremely seriously. In hindsight, it’s clear we failed to consider the critically important need for the public to be able to trust that their DNA data will only be shared and used with their permission and under the restrictions they choose. We should have reported these bugs to GEDmatch and stopped using the affected reports until the bugs were fixed. Instead, on that first day when we found that all of the profiles were set to opt-out, I discouraged our team from reporting them at all. I now know I was wrong and I regret my words and actions.</em></p>

<p>“The Plumber Problem” is a phrase I coined to describe the experience of watching a movie that touches on some subject area that you know way more about than the average person, and then some inaccuracy in what’s depicted distracts you and takes you out of the movie. (This can occur in any work of fiction, of course: movies, TV, books, etc.)</p>

<p>Here’s an example. A plumber is watching a movie with a scene where something having to do with pipes is integral to the plot. But it’s all wrong, and the plumber’s mind rebels. No one else in the audience is bothered. They’re all still wrapped up in the narrative. But the plumber has a problem.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how long ago I came up with this phrase. The earliest recorded occurrence I can find is from 2021, in <a href="https://www.relay.fm/rd/153">episode #153 of Reconcilable Differences</a> (<a href="https://overcast.fm/+E5IOGS27o/47:02">at 47:02</a>) where I explain it to my cohost, <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/">Merlin</a>, so it obviously predates that.</p>

<p>The Plumber Problem is loosely related to the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton#GellMannAmnesiaEffect">Gell-Mann amnesia effect</a>” which is “the phenomenon of experts believing news articles written on topics outside of their fields of expertise, yet acknowledging that articles written in the same publication within their fields of expertise are error-ridden and full of misunderstanding.”

</p><p>Anyway, I was thinking about this today thanks to some people on <a href="https://mastodon.social/">Mastodon</a> sending <a href="https://mastodon.social/@siracusa">me</a> examples of The Plumber Problem. Here are a few (lightly edited):</p>

<blockquote><a href="https://mastodon.social/@snowdolphin/110905581273831250">Simon Orrell</a>: My first exposure to “The Plumber Problem” was sitting in a theatre with my dad in 1973 watching “Emperor of the North” and my dad leans over to whisper, “They didn’t make culvert pipe like that back in the ’30s. It was plate, not corrugated.”</blockquote>

<br>

<blockquote><a href="https://sfba.social/@kalong/110908035186703085">Tim Allen</a>: In Speed 2, a plot point involves a laden oil tanker about to collide explosively. My wife, native to a major oil port city, couldn’t follow the plot because she could tell the tanker was empty just by looking at it, so she didn’t understand why everyone was saying it would explode.</blockquote>

<br>

<blockquote><a href="https://vmst.io/@DanMorgan/110910521055493784">Dan Morgan</a>: Interstellar’s farming scenes were just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/ek1ln7/in_interstellar_2014_there_are_numerous_scenes_of/">SO BAD</a>. I’m not going to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/ek1ln7/in_interstellar_2014_there_are_numerous_scenes_of/">detail</a> them here, but this retired farmer and agronomist found it hard to watch. I’m sure the physics were fine though. 😂</blockquote>

<p>Someone also <a href="https://vis.social/@gretared/110907538291037006">mentioned</a> that “The Plumber Problem” is not an easy phrase to look up online, so here’s hoping this post remedies that situation.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here’s one more bonus post that I enjoyed:</p>

<blockquote><a href="https://social.lol/@daisy55/110911857615301788">magic</a>: In Star Wars, Luke turns off his targeting computer to use the Force for his attack run on the Death Star. I’ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I’ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I’ve never seen anything to make me believe there’s one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There’s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.</blockquote>

<p>
The original ANSI C standard, C89, introduced the concept of “undefined behavior,”
which was used both to describe the effect of outright bugs like
accessing memory in a freed object
and also to capture the fact that existing implementations differed about
handling certain aspects of the language,
including use of uninitialized values,
signed integer overflow, and null pointer handling.

</p><p>
The C89 spec defined undefined behavior (in section 1.6) as:</p><blockquote>

<p>
Undefined behavior—behavior, upon use of a nonportable or
erroneous program construct, of erroneous data, or of
indeterminately-valued objects, for which the Standard imposes no
requirements.  Permissible undefined behavior ranges from ignoring the
situation completely with unpredictable results, to behaving during
translation or program execution in a documented manner characteristic
of the environment (with or without the issuance of a diagnostic
message), to terminating a translation or execution (with the issuance
of a diagnostic message).</p></blockquote>

<p>
Lumping both non-portable and buggy code into the same category was a mistake.
As time has gone on, the way compilers treat undefined behavior
has led to more and more unexpectedly broken programs,
to the point where it is becoming difficult to tell whether any program
will compile to the meaning in the original source.
This post looks at a few examples and then tries to make some general observations.
In particular, today’s C and C++ prioritize
performance to the clear detriment of correctness.
<a href="#uninit"></a></p><h2 id="uninit"><a href="#uninit">Uninitialized variables</a></h2>


<p>
C and C++ do not require variables to be initialized
on declaration (explicitly or implicitly) like Go and Java.
Reading from an uninitialized variable is undefined behavior.

</p><p>
In a <a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html">blog post</a>,
Chris Lattner (creator of LLVM and Clang) explains the rationale:</p><blockquote>

<p>
<b>Use of an uninitialized variable</b>:
This is commonly known as source of problems in C programs
and there are many tools to catch these:
from compiler warnings to static and dynamic analyzers.
This improves performance by not requiring that all variables
be zero initialized when they come into scope (as Java does).
For most scalar variables, this would cause little overhead,
but stack arrays and malloc’d memory would incur
a memset of the storage, which could be quite costly,
particularly since the storage is usually completely overwritten.</p></blockquote>

<p>
Early C compilers were too crude to detect
use of uninitialized basic variables like integers and pointers,
but modern compilers are dramatically more sophisticated.
They could absolutely react in these cases by
“terminating a translation or execution (with the issuance
of a diagnostic message),”
which is to say reporting a compile error.
Or, if they were worried about not rejecting old programs,
they could insert a zero initialization with, as Lattner admits, little overhead.
But they don’t do either of these.
Instead, they just do whatever they feel like during code generation.

</p><p>
For example, here’s a simple C++ program with an uninitialized variable (a bug):
</p><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    for(int i; i &lt; 10; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }
    return 0;
}
</pre>


<p>
If you compile this with <code>clang++</code> <code>-O1</code>, it deletes the loop entirely:
<code>main</code> contains only the <code>return</code> <code>0</code>.
In effect, Clang has noticed the uninitialized variable and chosen
not to report the error to the user but instead
to pretend <code>i</code> is always initialized above 10, making the loop disappear.

</p><p>
It is true that if you compile with <code>-Wall</code>, then Clang does report the
use of the uninitialized variable as a warning.
This is why you should always build with and fix warnings in C and C++ programs.
But not all compiler-optimized undefined behaviors
are reliably reported as warnings.
<a href="#overflow"></a></p><h2 id="overflow"><a href="#overflow">Arithmetic overflow</a></h2>


<p>
At the time C89 was standardized, there were still legacy
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ones%27_complement">ones’-complement computers</a>,
so ANSI C could not assume the now-standard two’s-complement representation
for negative numbers.
In two’s complement, an <code>int8</code> −1 is 0b11111111;
in ones’ complement that’s −0, while −1 is 0b11111110.
This meant that operations like signed integer overflow could not be defined,
because</p><blockquote>

<p>
<code>int8</code> 127+1 = 0b01111111+1 = 0b10000000</p></blockquote>

<p>
is −127 in ones’ complement but −128 in two’s complement.
That is, signed integer overflow was non-portable.
Declaring it undefined behavior let compilers escalate the behavior
from “non-portable”, with one of two clear meanings,
to whatever they feel like doing.
For example, a common thing programmers expect is that you can test
for signed integer overflow by checking whether the result is
less than one of the operands, as in this program:
</p><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int f(int x) {
    if(x+100 &lt; x)
        printf("overflow\n");
    return x+100;
}
</pre>


<p>
Clang optimizes away the <code>if</code> statement.
The justification is that since signed integer overflow is undefined behavior,
the compiler can assume it never happens, so <code>x+100</code> must never be less than <code>x</code>.
Ironically, this program would correctly detect overflow
on both ones’-complement and two’s-complement machines
if the compiler would actually emit the check.

</p><p>
In this case, <code>clang++</code> <code>-O1</code> <code>-Wall</code> prints no warning while it deletes the <code>if</code> statement,
and neither does <code>g++</code>,
although I seem to remember it used to, perhaps in subtly different situations
or with different flags.

</p><p>
For C++20, the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0907r0.html">first version of proposal P0907</a>
suggested standardizing that signed integer overflow
wraps in two’s complement. The original draft gave a very clear statement of the history
of the undefined behavior and the motivation for making a change:</p><blockquote>

<p>
[C11] Integer types allows three representations for signed integral types:
</p><ul>
<li>
Signed magnitude
</li><li>
Ones’ complement
</li><li>
Two’s complement</li></ul>


<p>
See §4 C Signed Integer Wording for full wording.

</p><p>
C++ inherits these three signed integer representations from C. To the author’s knowledge no modern machine uses both C++ and a signed integer representation other than two’s complement (see §5 Survey of Signed Integer Representations). None of [MSVC], [GCC], and [LLVM] support other representations. This means that the C++ that is taught is effectively two’s complement, and the C++ that is written is two’s complement. It is extremely unlikely that there exist any significant code base developed for two’s complement machines that would actually work when run on a non-two’s complement machine.

</p><p>
The C++ that is spec’d, however, is not two’s complement. Signed integers currently allow for trap representations, extra padding bits, integral negative zero, and introduce undefined behavior and implementation-defined behavior for the sake of this extremely abstract machine.

</p><p>
Specifically, the current wording has the following effects:
</p><ul>
<li>
Associativity and commutativity of integers is needlessly obtuse.
</li><li>
Naïve overflow checks, which are often security-critical, often get eliminated by compilers. This leads to exploitable code when the intent was clearly not to and the code, while naïve, was correctly performing security checks for two’s complement integers. Correct overflow checks are difficult to write and equally difficult to read, exponentially so in generic code.
</li><li>
Conversion between signed and unsigned are implementation-defined.
</li><li>
There is no portable way to generate an arithmetic right-shift, or to sign-extend an integer, which every modern CPU supports.
</li><li>
constexpr is further restrained by this extraneous undefined behavior.
</li><li>
Atomic integral are already two’s complement and have no undefined results, therefore even freestanding implementations already support two’s complement in C++.</li></ul>


<p>
Let’s stop pretending that the C++ abstract machine should represent integers as signed magnitude or ones’ complement. These theoretical implementations are a different programming language, not our real-world C++. Users of C++ who require signed magnitude or ones’ complement integers would be better served by a pure-library solution, and so would the rest of us.</p></blockquote>

<p>
In the end, the C++ standards committee put up “strong resistance against” the idea of defining
signed integer overflow the way every programmer expects; the undefined behavior remains.
<a href="#loops"></a></p><h2 id="loops"><a href="#loops">Infinite loops</a></h2>


<p>
A programmer would never accidentally cause a program to execute an infinite loop, would they?
Consider this program:
</p><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int stop = 1;

void maybeStop() {
    if(stop)
        for(;;);
}

int main() {
    printf("hello, ");
    maybeStop();
    printf("world\n");
}
</pre>


<p>
This seems like a completely reasonable program to write. Perhaps you are debugging and want the program to stop so you can attach a debugger. Changing the initializer for <code>stop</code> to <code>0</code> lets the program run to completion.
But it turns out that, at least with the latest Clang, the program runs to completion anyway:
the call to <code>maybeStop</code> is optimized away entirely, even when <code>stop</code> is <code>1</code>.

</p><p>
The problem is that C++ defines that every side-effect-free loop may be assumed by the compiler to terminate.
That is, a loop that does not terminate is therefore undefined behavior.
This is purely for compiler optimizations, once again treated as more important than correctness.
The rationale for this decision played out in the C standard and was more or less adopted in the C++ standard as well.

</p><p>
John Regehr pointed out this problem in his post
“<a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/140">C Compilers Disprove Fermat’s Last Theorem</a>,”
which included this entry in a FAQ:</p><blockquote>

<p>
Q: Does the C standard permit/forbid the compiler to terminate infinite loops?

</p><p>
A: The compiler is given considerable freedom in how it implements the C program,
but its output must have the same externally visible behavior that the program would have when interpreted by the “C abstract machine” that is described in the standard.  Many knowledgeable people (including me) read this as saying that the termination behavior of a program must not be changed.  Obviously some compiler writers disagree, or else don’t believe that it matters.  The fact that reasonable people disagree on the interpretation would seem to indicate that the C standard is flawed.</p></blockquote>

<p>
A few months later, Douglas Walls wrote <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1509.pdf">WG14/N1509: Optimizing away infinite loops</a>,
making the case that the standard should <i>not</i> allow this optimization.
In response, Hans-J. Boehm wrote
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1528.htm">WG14/N1528: Why undefined behavior for infinite loops?</a>,
arguing for allowing the optimization.

</p><p>
Consider the potential optimization of this code:
</p><pre>for (p = q; p != 0; p = p-&gt;next)
    ++count;
for (p = q; p != 0; p = p-&gt;next)
    ++count2;
</pre>


<p>
A sufficiently smart compiler might reduce it to this code:
</p><pre>for (p = q; p != 0; p = p-&gt;next) {
        ++count;
        ++count2;
}
</pre>


<p>
Is that safe? Not if the first loop is an infinite loop. If the list at <code>p</code> is cyclic and another thread is modifying <code>count2</code>,
then the first program has no race, while the second program does.
Compilers clearly can’t turn correct, race-free programs into racy programs.
But what if we declare that infinite loops are not correct programs?
That is, what if infinite loops were undefined behavior?
Then the compiler could optimize to its robotic heart’s content.
This is exactly what the C standards committee decided to do.

</p><p>
The rationale, paraphrased, was:
</p><ul>
<li>
It is very difficult to tell if a given loop is infinite.
</li><li>
Infinite loops are rare and typically unintentional.
</li><li>
There are many loop optimizations that are only valid for non-infinite loops.
</li><li>
The performance wins of these optimizations are deemed important.
</li><li>
Some compilers already apply these optimizations, making infinite loops non-portable too.
</li><li>
Therefore, we should declare programs with infinite loops undefined behavior, enabling the optimizations.</li></ul>
<a href="#null"><h2 id="null">Null pointer usage</h2></a>


<p>
We’ve all seen how dereferencing a null pointer causes a crash on modern operating systems:
they leave page zero unmapped by default precisely for this purpose.
But not all systems where C and C++ run have hardware memory protection.
For example, I wrote my first C and C++ programs using Turbo C on an MS-DOS system.
Reading or writing a null pointer did not cause any kind of fault:
the program just touched the memory at location zero and kept running.
The correctness of my code improved dramatically when I moved to
a Unix system that made those programs crash at the moment of the mistake.
Because the behavior is non-portable, though, dereferencing a null pointer is undefined behavior.

</p><p>
At some point, the justification for keeping the undefined behavior became performance.
<a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html">Chris Lattner explains</a>:</p><blockquote>

<p>
In C-based languages, NULL being undefined enables a large number of simple scalar optimizations that are exposed as a result of macro expansion and inlining.</p></blockquote>

<p>
In <a href="https://research.swtch.com/plmm#ub">an earlier post</a>, I showed this example, lifted from <a href="https://twitter.com/andywingo/status/903577501745770496">Twitter in 2017</a>:
</p><pre>#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;

typedef int (*Function)();

static Function Do;

static int EraseAll() {
    return system("rm -rf slash");
}

void NeverCalled() {
    Do = EraseAll;
}

int main() {
    return Do();
}
</pre>


<p>
Because calling <code>Do()</code> is undefined behavior when <code>Do</code> is null, a modern C++ compiler like Clang
simply assumes that can’t possibly be what’s happening in <code>main</code>.
Since <code>Do</code> must be either null or <code>EraseAll</code> and since null is undefined behavior,
we might as well assume <code>Do</code> is <code>EraseAll</code> unconditionally,
even though <code>NeverCalled</code> is never called.
So this program can be (and is) optimized to:
</p><pre>int main() {
    return system("rm -rf slash");
}
</pre>


<p>
Lattner gives <a href="https://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know_14.html">an equivalent example</a> (search for <code>FP()</code>)
and then this advice:</p><blockquote>

<p>
The upshot is that it is a fixable issue: if you suspect something weird is going on like this, try building at -O0, where the compiler is much less likely to be doing any optimizations at all.</p></blockquote>

<p>
This advice is not uncommon: if you cannot debug the correctness problems in your C++ program, disable optimizations.
<a href="#sort"></a></p><h2 id="sort"><a href="#sort">Crashes out of sorts</a></h2>


<p>
C++’s <code>std::sort</code> sorts a collection of values
(abstracted as a random access iterator, but almost always an array)
according to a user-specified comparison function.
The default function is <code>operator&lt;</code>, but you can write any function.
For example if you were sorting instances of class <code>Person</code> your
comparison function might sort by the <code>LastName</code> field, breaking
ties with the <code>FirstName</code> field.
These comparison functions end up being subtle yet boring to write,
and it’s easy to make a mistake.
If you do make a mistake and pass in a comparison function that
returns inconsistent results or accidentally reports that any value
is less than itself, that’s undefined behavior:
<code>std::sort</code> is now allowed to do whatever it likes,
including walking off either end of the array
and corrupting other memory.
If you’re lucky, it will pass some of this memory to your comparison
function, and since it won’t have pointers in the right places,
your comparison function will crash.
Then at least you have a chance of guessing the comparison function is at fault.
In the worst case, memory is silently corrupted and the crash happens much later,
with <code>std::sort</code> is nowhere to be found.

</p><p>
Programmers make mistakes, and when they do, <code>std::sort</code> corupts memory.
This is not hypothetical. It happens enough in practice to be a
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18291620/why-will-stdsort-crash-if-the-comparison-function-is-not-as-operator">popular question on StackOverflow</a>.

</p><p>
As a final note, it turns out that <code>operator&lt;</code> is not a valid comparison function
on floating-point numbers if NaNs are involved, because:
</p><ul>
<li>
1 &lt; NaN and NaN &lt; 1 are both false, implying NaN == 1.
</li><li>
2 &lt; NaN and NaN &lt; 2 are both false, implying NaN == 2.
</li><li>
Since NaN == 1 and NaN == 2, 1 == 2, yet 1 &lt; 2 is true.</li></ul>


<p>
Programming with NaNs is never pleasant, but it seems particularly extreme
to allow <code>std::sort</code> to crash when handed one.
<a href="#reveal"></a></p><h2 id="reveal"><a href="#reveal">Reflections and revealed preferences</a></h2>


<p>
Looking over these examples,
it could not be more obvious that in modern C and C++,
performance is job one and correctness is job two.
To a C/C++ compiler, a programmer making a mistake and (gasp!)
compiling a program containing a bug is just not a concern.
Rather than have the compiler point out the bug or at least
compile the code in a clear, understandable, debuggable manner,
the approach over and over again is
to let the compiler do whatever it likes,
in the name of performance.

</p><p>
This may not be the wrong decision for these languages.
There are undeniably power users for whom every last bit of performance
translates to very large sums of money, and I don’t claim
to know how to satisfy them otherwise.
On the other hand, this performance comes at a significant
development cost, and there are probably plenty of people and companies
who spend more than their performance savings
on unnecessarily difficult debugging sessions
and additional testing and sanitizing.
It also seems like there must be a middle ground where
programmers retain most of the control they have in C and C++
but the program doesn’t crash when sorting NaNs or
behave arbitrarily badly if you accidentally dereference a null pointer.
Whatever the merits, it is important to see clearly the choice that C and C++ are making.

</p><p>
In the case of arithmetic overflow, later drafts of the
proposal removed the defined behavior for wrapping, explaining:</p><blockquote>

<p>
The main change between [P0907r0] and the subsequent revision is to maintain undefined behavior when signed integer overflow occurs, instead of defining wrapping behavior. This direction was motivated by:
</p><ul>
<li>
Performance concerns, whereby defining the behavior prevents optimizers from assuming that overflow never occurs;
</li><li>
Implementation leeway for tools such as sanitizers;
</li><li>
Data from Google suggesting that over 90% of all overflow is a bug, and defining wrapping behavior would not have solved the bug.</li></ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
Again, performance concerns rank first.
I find the third item in the list particularly telling.
I’ve known C/C++ compiler authors who got excited about a 0.1% performance improvement,
and incredibly excited about 1%.
Yet here we have an idea that would change 10% of affected programs from incorrect to correct,
and it is rejected, because performance is more important.

</p><p>
The argument about sanitizers is more nuanced.
Leaving a behavior undefined allows any implementation at all, including reporting the
behavior at runtime and stopping the program.
True, the widespread use of undefined behavior enables sanitizers like ThreadSanitizer, MemorySanitizer, and UBSan,
but so would defining the behavior as “either this specific behavior, or a sanitizer report.”
If you believed correctness was job one, you could
define overflow to wrap, fixing the 10% of programs outright
and making the 90% behave at least more predictably,
and then at the same time define that overflow is still
a bug that can be reported by sanitizers.
You might object that requiring wrapping in the absence of a sanitizer
would hurt performance, and that’s fine: it’s just more evidence that
performance trumps correctness.

</p><p>
One thing I find surprising, though, is that correctness gets ignored even
when it clearly doesn’t hurt performance.
It would certainly not hurt performance to emit a compiler warning
about deleting the <code>if</code> statement testing for signed overflow,
or about optimizing away the possible null pointer dereference in <code>Do()</code>.
Yet I could find no way to make compilers report either one; certainly not <code>-Wall</code>.

</p><p>
The explanatory shift from non-portable to optimizable also seems revealing.
As far as I can tell, C89 did not use performance as a justification for any of
its undefined behaviors.
They were non-portabilities, like signed overflow and null pointer dereferences,
or they were outright bugs, like use-after-free.
But now experts like Chris Lattner and Hans Boehm point to optimization potential,
not portability, as justification for undefined behaviors.
I conclude that the rationales really have shifted from the mid-1980s to today:
an idea that meant to capture non-portability has been preserved for performance,
trumping concerns like correctness and debuggability.

</p><p>
Occasionally in Go we have <a href="https://go.dev/blog/compat#input">changed library functions to remove surprising behavior</a>,
It’s always a difficult decision, but we are willing
to break existing programs depending on a mistake
if correcting the mistake fixes a much larger number of programs.
I find it striking that the C and C++ standards committees are
willing in some cases to break existing programs if doing so
merely <i>speeds up</i> a large number of programs.
This is exactly what happened with the infinite loops.

</p><p>
I find the infinite loop example telling for a second reason:
it shows clearly the escalation from non-portable to optimizable.
In fact, it would appear that if you want to break C++ programs in
service of optimization, one possible approach is to just do that in a
compiler and wait for the standards committee to notice.
The de facto non-portability of whatever programs you have broken
can then serve as justification for undefining their behavior,
leading to a future version of the standard in which your optimization is legal.
In the process, programmers have been handed yet another footgun
to try to avoid setting off.

</p><p>
(A common counterargument is that the standards committee cannot
force existing implementations to change their compilers.
This doesn’t hold up to scrutiny: every new feature that gets added
is the standards committee forcing existing implementations
to change their compilers.)

</p><p>
I am not claiming that anything should change about C and C++.
I just want people to recognize that the current versions of these
sacrifice correctness for performance.
To some extent, all languages do this: there is almost always a tradeoff
between performance and slower, safer implementations.
Go has data races in part for performance reasons:
we could have done everything by message copying
or with a single global lock instead, but the performance wins of
shared memory were too large to pass up.
For C and C++, though, it seems no performance win is too small
to trade against correctness.

</p><p>
As a programmer, you have a tradeoff to make too,
and the language standards make it clear which side they are on.
In some contexts, performance is the dominant priority and
nothing else matters quite as much.
If so, C or C++ may be the right tool for you.
But in most contexts, the balance flips the other way.
If programmer productivity, debuggability, reproducible bugs,
and overall correctness and understandability
are more important than squeezing every last little bit of performance,
then C and C++ are not the right tools for you.
I say this with some regret, as I spent many years happily writing C programs.

I have tried to avoid exaggerated, hyperbolic language in this post,
instead laying out the tradeoff and the preferences revealed
by the decisions being made.
John Regehr wrote a less restrained series of posts about undefined behavior
a decade ago, and in <a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/226">one of them</a> he concluded:</p><blockquote>

<p>
It is basically evil to make certain program actions wrong, but to not give developers any way to tell whether or not their code performs these actions and, if so, where. One of C’s design points was “trust the programmer.” This is fine, but there’s trust and then there’s trust. I mean, I trust my 5 year old but I still don’t let him cross a busy street by himself. Creating a large piece of safety-critical or security-critical code in C or C++ is the programming equivalent of crossing an 8-lane freeway blindfolded.</p></blockquote>

<p>
To be fair to C and C++,
if you set yourself the goal of crossing an 8-lane freeway blindfolded,
it does make sense to focus on doing it as fast as you possibly can.
