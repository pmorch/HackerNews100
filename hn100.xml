    </p><div id="content">
        

        <p><strong>TL;DR: I will retire <a href="http://test-ipv6.com/">test-ipv6.com</a> in December 2025.</strong></p>

        <p>I have provided <a href="http://test-ipv6.com/">test-ipv6.com</a> to the public since 2010. I've sunk significant resources - engineering, support, equipment, and hosting fees - into what is a revenue-free product.</p>

        <p>Without going into details: I feel now is the time for me to refocus my resources within the family.<br>
        I hope people will understand, and respect this decision.</p>

        <p>I am shutting the site down, with a target of "during winter break"  (December) 2025.</p>

        <p>Mirror operators: Should you wish to keep your mirrors up, they will stop getting updates in December.</p>

        <p>Service providers: If you have runbooks for your support team based on this site, or based on RIPE-631, you'll need to update those.</p>

        <p>FAQ:</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Will I (jfesler) transfer the source?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> These portions are already public.</p>

        <p>These are already public.<br>
        <a href="http://github.com/falling-sky/source">http://github.com/falling-sky/source</a><br>
        <a href="https://github.com/falling-sky/fsbuilder">https://github.com/falling-sky/fsbuilder</a> - used to build what's in source<br>
        <a href="https://github.com/falling-sky/mod_ip">https://github.com/falling-sky/mod_ip</a> - the /ip/ handler for Apache<br>
        <a href="https://github.com/falling-sky/mtu1280d">https://github.com/falling-sky/mtu1280d</a> - the synthetic MTU180 netfilter daemon.</p>

        <p>The remaining parts, such as geolocation and service provider lookups,  I am contractually unable to release.  Please do not ask.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Will I (jfesler) transfer the domain?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> I’d consider a reputable RIR or NIC organization serving the public interest taking things over.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Should mirrors be retired?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> I would suggest it.  Once the primary site is retired, I will stop monitoring the functionality of your mirror, and stop providing geolocation and service provider lookups.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: I have more questions or comments!</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> If we ever meet for coffee or beer, ask me then.</p>

With the same weight, a person can do a squat in two seconds or 10 seconds. The latter is harder, but it also builds more muscle. More time is more tension; more pain is more gain.</p><p>Thinking benefits from a similar principle of “time under tension.” It is the ability to sit patiently with a group of barely connected or disconnected ideas that allows a thinker to braid them together into something that is combinatorially new.

The problem is whether we will degrade </span><em>our own capabilities</em><span> in the presence of new machines. We are so fixated on how technology will outskill us that we miss the many ways that we can deskill ourselves.</span></p><p>You have 18 months.</p><p><span>That’s the message from several leading AI executives and thinkers about how long people will retain their advantage over artificial intelligence in the workforce. By the summer of 2027, the story goes, AI’s</span><a href="https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/scott-daniel" rel=""> explosion in capabilities</a><span> will leave carbon-based life forms in the dust. Up to</span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/ai-jobs-white-collar-unemployment-anthropic" rel=""> “half of all entry-level white-collar jobs</a><span>” will be wiped out, and even Nobel Prize-worthy minds will cower in fear that AI’s architects will have built a</span><a href="https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/machines-of-loving-grace" rel=""> “country of geniuses in a datacenter.”</a></p><p><span>This doomsday clock seems true enough to many people, because the question I’ve fielded more than any other from parents in the last few months is some version of: “If AI is about to be better than us at everything, what should my children do?”</span><em> </em><span>If generative AI is better at coding, diagnosing, and problem-solving than any software programmer, radiologist, or mathematician, then even the traditionally “safe” majors like computer science, medicine, and math could be anything but safe.</span></p><p>I understand the anxiety behind the question, but rather than try to forecast the future as it might turn out, I’d prefer to describe reality as it already exists. While we have no idea how AI might make working people obsolete at some imaginary date, we can already see how technology is affecting our capacity to think deeply right now. And I am much more concerned about the decline of thinking people than I am about the rise of thinking machines.</p><p><span>In March, </span><em>New York</em><span> </span><em>Magazine</em><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/openai-chatgpt-ai-cheating-education-college-students-school.html" rel=""> published</a><span> the sort of cover story that goes instantly viral, not because of its shock value, but, quite the opposite, because it loudly proclaimed what most people were already thinking: Everybody is using AI to cheat in school.</span></p><p><span>By allowing high-school and college students to summon into existence any essay on any topic, large language models have created an existential crisis for teachers trying to evaluate their students’ ability to actually write. “College is just how well I can use ChatGPT at this point,” one student told </span><em>New York Magazine</em><span>. “Massive numbers of students are going to emerge from university with degrees, and into the workforce, who are essentially illiterate,” a professor echoed.</span></p><p><span>The demise of writing matters because writing is not a second thing that happens after thinking. The act of writing </span><em>is</em><span> an act of thinking. This is as true for professionals as it is for students. In “Writing is thinking,” an editorial in </span><em>Nature</em><span>, the authors </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44222-025-00323-4" rel="">argued</a><span> that “outsourcing the entire writing process to LLMs” deprives scientists of the important work of understanding what they’ve discovered and why it matters.</span></p><p>Students, scientists, and anyone else who lets AI do the writing for them will find their screens full of words and their minds emptied of thought.</p><p><span>As writing skills have declined, reading has declined even more. “Most of our students are functionally illiterate,” a pseudonymous college professor using the name Hilarius Bookbinder</span><a href="https://hilariusbookbinder.substack.com/p/the-average-college-student-today" rel=""> wrote</a><span> in a March Substack essay on the state of college campuses. “This is not a joke.” Nor is it hyperbole.</span></p><p><span>Achievement scores in literacy and numeracy </span><a href="https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/highlights/ltt/2022/" rel="">are declining</a><span> across the West for the first time in decades, leading the </span><em>Financial Times</em><span> reporter John Burn-Murdoch to</span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a8016c64-63b7-458b-a371-e0e1c54a13fc" rel=""> wonder</a><span> if humans have “passed peak brain power” at the very moment that we are building machines to think for us. In the U.S., the so-called</span><a href="https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reports/reading/2024/g12/" rel=""> Nation’s Report Card</a><span>, published by the NAEP, recently found that average reading scores hit a 32-year low in 2024 — which is troubling, since the data series only goes back 32 years.</span></p><p><span>Of course, Americans are reading words all the time: email, texts, social media newsfeeds, subtitles on Netflix shows. But these words live in writing fragments that hardly require any kind of sustained focus necessary to make sense of a larger text. Indeed, Americans in the digital age don’t seem interested in or capable of sitting with anything longer than a tweet. The share of Americans overall who say they read books for leisure</span><a href="https://www.derekthompson.org/publish/post/173751882" rel=""> has declined</a><span> by nearly 40% since the 2000s.</span></p><p><span>Even America’s highest-performing students have essentially stopped reading anything longer than a paragraph. Last year, </span><em>The Atlantic</em><span>’s Rose Horowitch </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/11/the-elite-college-students-who-cant-read-books/679945/" rel="">reported</a><span> that students are matriculating into America’s most-elite colleges without having ever read a full book for school. “Daniel Shore, the chair of Georgetown’s English department, told me that his students have trouble staying focused on even a sonnet,” Horowitch wrote.</span></p><p>Nat Malkus, an education researcher at the American Enterprise Institute, suggested to me that high schools have chunkified books to prepare students for the reading-comprehension sections of standardized exams. By optimizing the assessment of reading skills, the U.S. education system appears to have accidentally killed book reading.</p><p><span>The decline of writing and reading matters because writing and reading are the twin pillars of deep thinking, according to Cal Newport, a computer science professor and the author of several bestselling books, including </span><em>Deep Work</em><span>. The modern economy prizes the sort of symbolic logic and systems thinking for which deep reading and writing are the best practice.</span></p><p>AI is “the latest in multiple heavyweight entrances into the prize fight against our ability to actually think,” Newport said. The rise of TV corresponded with the decline in per capita newspaper subscriptions and a slow demise of reading for pleasure. Then along came the internet, followed by social media, the smartphone, and streaming TV.</p><p>“The one-two punch of reading and writing is like the serum we have to take in a superhero comic book to gain the superpower of deep symbolic thinking,” Newport said. “And so I have been ringing this alarm bell that we have to keep taking the serum.”</p><p>Newport’s warning echoes an observation made by the scholar Walter Ong in his book “Orality and Literacy.” According to Ong, literacy is no passing skill. It was a means of restructuring human thought and knowledge to create space for complex ideas.</p><p>Stories can be memorized by people who cannot read or write. But nothing as advanced as, say, Newton’s “Principia” could be passed down from generation to generation without the ability to write down calculus formulas. Oral dialects commonly have only a few thousand words, while “the grapholect known as standard English has … at least a million and a half words,” Ong wrote. If reading and writing “rewired” the logic engine of the human brain, the decline of reading and writing are unwiring our cognitive superpower at the very moment that a greater machine appears to be on the horizon.</p><p>So what should our children study in an age of thinking machines? While I don’t know what field any particular student should major in, I do feel strongly about what skill they should value: It’s the very same skill that I see in decline. It’s the patience to read long and complex texts; to hold conflicting ideas in our heads and enjoy their dissonance; to engage in hand-to-hand combat at the sentence level within a piece of writing — and to value these things at a time when valuing them is a choice, because video entertainment is replacing reading and ChatGPT essays are replacing writing. As AI becomes abundant, there is a clear and present threat that deep human thinking will become scarce.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<p>I set up my own VPS, documented every step, and ended up with a repeatable
deployment pipeline. This is both a checklist for my future self and a guide for
anyone curious about self-hosting. Along the way I'll explain why I picked
Hetzner and Coolify, and how they compare with other options like DigitalOcean,
AWS, Render, or Fly.io.</p>
<p>This comprehensive checklist covers every essential step for setting up a
secure, production-ready VPS. Each section includes commands, verification
steps, and troubleshooting tips based on real-world experience.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>This checklist provides a complete approach to VPS setup and management. This
isn’t just about saving money. It’s about control and understanding. By
self-hosting with Hetzner + Coolify, I built muscle memory for devops that paid
off in confidence and freedom.</p>
<p>If you’ve been meaning to try VPS hosting, consider this a nudge.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Back in 2009 Tim Berners-Lee drafted a web-specification for "Socially Aware Cloud Storage":</p><blockquote>There is an architecture in which a few existing or Web protocols are gathered together with some glue to make a world wide system in which applications (desktop or web application) can work on top of a layer of commodity read-write storage.<p>Crucial design issues are that principals (users) and groups are identifies by URIs, and so are global in scope, and that elements of storage are access controlled using those global identifiers. The result is that storage becomes a commodity, independent of the application running on it.</p></blockquote><figure><a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/CloudStorage.html"><div><p>Socially aware cloud storage - Design Issues</p><p><img src="https://www.w3.org/favicon.ico" alt=""></p></div><p><img src="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/diagrams/social/simondseconoart-small.png" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>Several of these ideas were going around in the late 2000s, shortly after the explosive growth of "web2" monoliths like Facebook.</p><p>Another spiritually similar idea being championed at the time came from the Opera browser folks who wanted to put <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2009/06/opera-hoping-to-reinvent-the-web-by-making-browser-a-server/">"a web server in your browser"</a>.</p><p>While 'Opera Unite' never fully materialized, Tim's spec got significant traction some years down the road as one privacy crisis after another made the case for stronger web agency self-evident.</p><p>In 2015 Tim &amp; co. <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/web-inventor-tim-berners-lees-next-project-platform-gives-users-control-their-data" rel="noreferrer">secured some funding for the Solid Protocol</a>.</p><blockquote>Right now we have the worst of both worlds, in which people not only cannot control their data, but also can’t really use it, due to it being spread across a number of different silo-ed websites. Our goal is to develop a web architecture that gives users ownership over their data, including the freedom to switch to new applications in search of better features, pricing, and policies.”</blockquote><figure><a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/04/tim-berners-lee-inventor-web-plots-radical-overhaul-creation/"><div><p>Tim Berners-Lee, Inventor of the Web, Plots a Radical Overhaul of His Creation</p><p>The creator of the web just received the equivalent of the Nobel Prize for computing.

For example, social networks would still run in the cloud. But you could store your data locally. Alternately, you could choose a different cloud server run by a company or community you trust. <p>You might have different servers for different types of information—for health and fitness data, say—that is completely separate from the one you use for financial records.</p></blockquote><p>To this day, Tim continues to eloquently champion <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/28/why-i-gave-the-world-wide-web-away-for-free">the virtues of the Solid vision</a>.</p><blockquote>We have the technical capability to give that power back to the individual. Solid is an open-source interoperable standard that I and my team developed at MIT more than a decade ago. Apps running on Solid don’t implicitly own your data – they have to request it from you and you choose whether to agree, or not. Rather than being in countless separate places on the internet in the hands of whomever it had been resold to, your data is in one place, controlled by you.<p>Sharing your information in a smart way can also liberate it. Why is your smartwatch writing your biological data to one silo in one format? Why is your credit card writing your financial data to a second silo in a different format? Why are your YouTube comments, Reddit posts, Facebook updates and tweets all stored in different places? Why is the default expectation that you aren’t supposed to be able to look at any of this stuff? <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2009/06/opera-hoping-to-reinvent-the-web-by-making-browser-a-server/">You generate all this data – your actions, your choices, your body, your preferences, your decisions. You should own it. You should be empowered&nbsp;by it.</a></p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://solidproject.org/">Solid Protocol</a> remains an excellent idea and has even culminated in an official <a href="https://www.w3.org/2024/09/linked-web-storage-wg-charter.html">web specification</a>, but Solid has not yet amounted to any mainstream adoption on the web. Its primary financial sponsor <a href="https://www.inrupt.com/" rel="noreferrer">Inrupt</a> (of which Tim is co-founder &amp; CTO) has focused on the enterprise market as a path to sustainability; it remains to be seen what resources will be directed towards web-scale adoption of Solid.</p><p>Thankfully those of us who want data ownership and agency in our web applications <em>now</em> don't have to wait. <a href="https://atproto.com/" rel="noreferrer">AT Protocol</a> was ushered in by the folks at <a href="https://bsky.social/" rel="noreferrer">Bluesky</a>, now with a network of over 30M people strong and increasingly spread across multiple federated platforms/communities like <a href="https://blackskyweb.xyz/" rel="noreferrer">Blacksky</a> or <a href="https://tangled.org/">Tangled</a>.</p><p>While the respective architectures of the <em>Solid </em>and <em>AT </em>protocols are quite different, they're pointing to the same Open Social Web, re-built on the principles of user-sovereign data storage.</p><p>What web-user sovereignty looks like in practice, from the vantage point of atproto, has been expertly illustrated by <a href="https://danabra.mov/">danabra.mov</a></p><figure><a href="https://overreacted.io/open-social/"><div><p>Open Social — overreacted</p><p>The protocol is the API.</p><p><img src="https://overreacted.io/icon.png?e0852c1e2c7f0e65" alt=""></p></div><p><img src="https://overreacted.io/open-social/opengraph-image?5b0b970dfd19bb8c" alt=""></p></a></figure><blockquote>Notice that Alice’s handle is now <code>@alice.com</code>. It is not allocated by a social media company [like facebook.com/alice]. Rather, her handle is <em>the</em> universal “internet handle”, i.e. a domain. Alice <em>owns</em> the <code>alice.com</code> domain, so she can <em>use it as a handle</em> on any open social app. (On most open social apps, she goes by <code>@alice.com</code>, but for others she wants a distinct disconnected identity, so she owns another handle she’d rather not share.)<p>Bob owns a domain too, even though he isn’t technical. He might not even know what a “domain” is. Bob just thinks of <code>@bob.com</code> as his “internet handle”. Some open social apps will offer you a free subdomain on registration, just like Gmail gives you a free Gmail address, or may offer an extra flow for buying a domain. You’re not locked into your first choice, and can swap to a different domain later.</p><p>(...) With open social, Alice’s data—her posts, likes, follows, etc—<em>is</em> hosted on the web itself. Alongside her personal site, Alice now has a <em>personal repository</em> of her data.</p></blockquote><p>This new paradigm is made technically possible by what the AT protocol refers to as a <a href="https://atproto.wiki/en/wiki/reference/core-architecture/pds" rel="noreferrer">Personal Data Server</a> or PDS for short (what Solid calls a <a href="https://solidproject.org/faq#pod">Pod</a>).</p><p>The notion of a 'PDS' quickly comes off as something very technical and nerdy which is why it's not mentioned once in Dan's explainer, even though it's still targeted at an audience of <em>web nerds</em>. But really the only obscure word here is the <em>Server</em>, which in this context is interchangeable with <em>Storage</em>, as in Personal Data Storage.</p><p>Even regular internet users have some mental model of what personalized data storage entails, especially with the complementary framing of <em>collectively owned and operated</em> data storage.</p><h2 id="data-banking-coops">Data-banking Coops</h2><p>If you're a regular internet user the PDS paradigm won't move your data from the cloud to your personal computer. Most people will still rely on an institutional cloud service, but instead of data-banking with a shareholder-controlled corporation most people’s data can be entrusted to the equivalent of member-owned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_union">credit unions</a> for data storage.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.muni.town/content/images/2025/09/IMG_2977.jpeg" alt="As the economy was transformed by industrialization and then by consumer banking, powerful new players such as Standard Oil, J.P. Morgan, and a handful of others threatened the freedom of citizens. In order to provide a counterweight to these new powers, citizens joined together to form trade unions and cooperative banking institutions, which were federally chartered to represent their members’ interests. These citizen organizations helped balance the economic and social power between large and small players and between employers and worker. The same collective organization is required to move from an individualized asset-based understanding of data control to a collective system based on rights and accountability, with legal standards upheld by a new class of representatives who act as fiduciaries for their members. In the U.S. almost 100 million people are members of credit unions, not-for-profit institutions owned by their members, and already chartered to securely manage their members’ digital data and to represent them in a wide variety of financial transactions, including insurance, investments, and benefits. The question then is, could we apply the same push for citizen power to the area of data rights in the ever-growing digital economy?" loading="lazy" width="1418" height="643" srcset="https://blog.muni.town/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/IMG_2977.jpeg 600w, https://blog.muni.town/content/images/size/w1000/2025/09/IMG_2977.jpeg 1000w, https://blog.muni.town/content/images/2025/09/IMG_2977.jpeg 1418w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Source: </span><a href="https://ide.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Data-Cooperatives-final.pdf" rel="noreferrer"><span>https://ide.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Data-Cooperatives-final.pdf</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>One in every three US adults banks with a Credit Union. Achieving similar or better numbers for data storage is far from inconceivable considering how much our collective experience with Big Banking mirrors that of Big Tech/Social.</p><p>The concept of <a href="https://www.cip.org/blog/data-cooperatives" rel="noreferrer">data cooperatives</a> has already gained a lot of traction in the fediverse with several providers like <a href="https://social.coop/">social.coop</a>, <a href="https://data.coop/">data.coop</a> and <a href="https://cosocial.ca/">cosocial.ca</a> being operational for many years and still going strong. Soon the AT network will have a similarly co-owned institution in <a href="https://northskysocial.com/" rel="noreferrer">Northsky</a>.</p><p>Whether these providers are strictly cooperatives in the formal sense isn't what's most important here though; any suffuciently transparent, democratic and community-oriented data bank (like the aforementioned Blacksky, or the forthcoming Eurosky) is a valid steward and co-creator of an Open Social.</p><p>Data Ownership as a conversation changes when data resides primarily with people-governed institutions rather than corporations. Rather than arguing for what kinds of data we <em>ought to be</em> able to download from the corporate silos, the platforms should be asking us what kinds of data they may copy from <em>our servers</em>, and only with strictly temporary allowances.</p><p>And while the separation of user data and social platform is most fully realized today in the AT network, there are exciting signs of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">cross-pollination happening</a> in the ongoing development of atproto’s predecessor <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20250926/?li">https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20250926/?li</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45479820">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <!-- Left content -->
  <p>My colleagues and friends know that I prefer to communicate
with them via email rather than chat messaging.
There are many benefits in such a choice.
You may want to consider them and adopt the same stance.</p>
<h2 id="unified-inbox">Unified inbox</h2>
<p>My messages arrive in a single program, where I can process and tag them.
With messaging programs I’d have to iterate through Teams, Signal, WhatsApp,
Slack, Viber, FaceTime, LinkedIn, Messenger, Google Meet, Discord,
Mattermost, Instagram, WebEx, and possibly others,
to collect and process the messages sent on each platform.</p>
<h2 id="unified-archive">Unified archive</h2>
<p>Similarly, if I want to find a past message I have exactly one place
to search: my email archive.</p>
<h2 id="long-term-availability">Long term availability</h2>
<p>Companies get out of business or become acquired
and services can easily be discontinued;
for a reminder have a look at the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Discontinued_Google_services">64 services Google has discontinued</a>.
If you ever exchanged messages on ICQ, AIM, MSN Messenger, Skype,
Yahoo! Messenger, Google Hangouts, GChat, BlackBerry Messenger, or Campfire
your messages are now gone.
With email and local message storage
you control the lifetime of your messages
(provided you perform regular backups).
My email archive contains the messages I have
sent and received from 1986 onward.</p>
<h2 id="rich-functionality">Rich functionality</h2>
<p>Email clients offer rich functionality.
In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Thunderbird">Thunderbird</a>
email client, I use the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Folders for categorizing important messages.</li>
<li>Filters to file messages into folders and to avoid some spam.</li>
<li>Send-later functionality to manage message flows.</li>
<li>Tagging messages that require special handling (e.g.&nbsp;pending action,
handle at home, or handle at work).</li>
<li>Address book, with auto-filled salutations in two languages as a custom field.</li>
<li>Macros to automate the signing and sending of attachments.</li>
<li>Sorting of messages through various fields (sender, date, topic).</li>
<li>Sophisticated message search based on arbitrary field contents
and their combinations.</li>
<li>Off-line message processing and composition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some messaging systems offer some of these features, but all
features are certainly not universally available.</p>
<h2 id="single-interface">Single interface</h2>
<p>Having a single messaging interface allows me to invest in becoming
maximally productive in the email client application I’m using.
I can learn its features in-depth,
I can tailor it with plug-ins,
and I can extend it to fit my needs.
When using it (many hours a day)
my mind and muscles memorize how to perform common actions.
With messaging platforms I’d only be able to dabble in each.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-communication">Asynchronous communication</h2>
<p>Rather than having
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a>
and concentration interrupted by incoming message notifications,
with email I can easily decide when to fetch and process messages.</p>
<h2 id="freedom-from-ads-and-addictive-content">Freedom from ads and addictive content</h2>
<p>Some “free” messaging services serve together with the messages
ads or addictive content, such as short-form videos.
Email clients will only display email messages.</p>
<h2 id="confidentiality">Confidentiality</h2>
<p>Depending on the email provider I choose, I can obtain strong
guarantees on who reads my email messages.
Some, like <a href="https://proton.me/mail">Proton Mail</a> are explicitly
targeting people who want to protect their privacy.
In contrast, many messaging platform will scan my messages
to send me targeted ads or train their AI systems on them.</p>
<h2 id="open-protocols">Open protocols</h2>
<p>Email is transported with open protocols (SMTP, IMAP),
which means I can use any email client and operating system
I want and obtain any functionality I need,
without depending on the business model or whims of the company
controlling a proprietary messaging platform.
I can even develop my own clients, something I have often done
to automate the sending of multi-part email messages to students
or conference committee members.</p>
<h2 id="open-storage-format">Open storage format</h2>
<p>My messages are stored as plain text files in the super-simple
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox">Mbox</a> file format,
which means I can easily process them with other tools,
reliably create backup copies, and
move them from one email client to another.</p>
<p>For example, I have a small script that removes all attachments
from old email messages, allowing me to keep my email archive
in a manageable size.
In other cases I’ve run on my message files scripts to analyze the messages I
send and receive, and I’ve opened them in my editor to fix
hardware-induced corruption.</p>

<p>In short, email can be an amazingly open and reliable environment
that fosters exceptional productivity.
We shouldn’t settle for anything less.</p>

					<h2>Social Cooling is a name for the <em>long-term negative side effects</em> of living in a reputation economy:</h2>
					
					<div>
							<h3>1. A culture of conformity</h3>
							<p>Have you ever hesitated to click&nbsp;on a link because you thought your visit might be logged, and it could look bad?</p>
							<p>More and more people feel this pressure, and they are starting to apply self-censorship.
						</p></div>
				</div>
			<div>
							<h3>2. A culture of risk-aversion</h3>
							<div><p>When doctors in New York were given scores this had unexpected results.</p><p>
							
							Doctors that tried to help advanced cancer patients had a higher mortality rate, which translated into a lower score.</p></div>
							<p>Doctors that didn't try to help were rewarded with high scores, even though their patients died prematurely.</p>
							<p><em>Rating systems can create unwanted incentives, and increase pressure to conform to a bureaucratic average.</em></p>
						</div>
			<div>
							<h3>3. Increased social rigidity</h3>
							<p>Digital reputation systems are limiting our ability and our will to protest injustice.</p>
							<p>In China each adult citizen is getting a government mandated "<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-34592186">social credit score</a>". This represents how well behaved they are, and is based on crime records,&nbsp;what they say on social media, what they buy,&nbsp;and even the scores of their friends.</p>
							<p>If you have a low score you can't get a government job, visa, cheap loan, or even a nice online date.</p>

							<h2>Are we becoming more well behaved, but less human?</h2>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>I</span>t’s not just you. The internet is getting worse, fast. The services we rely on, that we once loved? They’re all turning into piles of shit, all at once. Ask any Facebook user who has to scroll past 10 screens of engagement-bait, AI slop and surveillance ads just to get to one post by the people they are on the service to communicate with. This is infuriating. Frustrating. And, depending on how important those services are to you, <em>terrifying</em>.</p><p>In 2022, I coined a term to describe the sudden-onset platform collapse going on all around us: <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/nov/26/enshittification-macquarie-dictionary-word-of-the-year-explained" data-link-name="in body link">enshittification</a></em>. To my bittersweet satisfaction, that word is doing big&nbsp;numbers. In fact, it has achieved escape velocity. It&nbsp;isn’t&nbsp;just a way to say something got worse. It’s an analysis that explains the way an online service gets worse, how that worsening unfolds, and the contagion that’s causing everything to get worse, all at once.</p><p>This moment we’re living through, this Great Enshittening, is a material phenomenon, much like a disease, with symptoms, a mechanism and an epidemiology. When doctors observe patients who are sick with a novel pathogen, their first order of business is creating a natural history of the disease. This natural history is an ordered catalogue of the disease’s progress: what symptoms do patients exhibit, and in which order?</p><p>Here’s the natural history of enshittification:<br><strong>1</strong> First, platforms are good to their users.<br><strong>2</strong> Then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers.<br><strong>3</strong> Next, they abuse those customers to claw back all the value for themselves – and become a giant pile of shit.</p><p>This pattern is everywhere. Once you learn about it, you’ll start seeing it, too. Take <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon" data-link-name="in body link">Amazon</a>, a company that started out by making it possible to have any book shipped to your door and then became the only game in town for everything else, even as it dodged taxes and filled up with self-immolating crapgadgets and other junk.</p><p>In Jeff Bezos’s original business plan for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Amazon</a>, the company was called Relentless. Critics say that this is a reference to Bezos’s cutthroat competitive instincts, but Bezos always insisted that it was a reference to his company’s relentless commitment to customer service.</p><p>How did Amazon go from a logistics company that got packages to you quickly and efficiently to a behemoth of digital content defined by the Prime experience (which has much less to do with free shipping now and more with everything else)?</p><hr><h2 id="stage-1-good-to-users"><strong>Stage </strong><strong>1: good to </strong><strong>users</strong></h2><p>Amazon started with a large surplus of cash that it was able to allocate to its customers, and allocate it did. The company raised a fortune from early investors, then a larger fortune by listing on the stock market. Then it used that fortune to subsidise many goods, selling them below cost. It also subsidised shipping and offered a no-questions-asked, postage-paid returns policy.</p><p>This offer tempted millions of users to pile on to the platform. Once they were there, Prime membership went a long way to locking them in. Paying for shipping a year in advance is a powerful incentive to do your shopping on Amazon. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of Prime subscribers begin their e-commerce searches on Amazon and, if they find what they’re looking for, don’t shop around for a better deal.</p><p>You can think of Prime as a form of soft lock-in, Amazon binding you to its platform with a silken ribbon. But Amazon’s also got some iron chains in its toolbox. All the audiobooks and movies, and most of the ebooks and emagazines, you buy from Amazon are permanently locked to its platform.</p><p>They are sold with digital rights management (DRM), a form of encryption designed to force you to view or listen using apps that Amazon controls. Break up with Amazon and delete your apps, and you will lose all the media you’ve ever bought from the platform. For a certain kind of reader, listener or movie buff, this is a very high switching cost indeed.</p><p>Amazon has one more trick up its sleeve: after years of selling goods below cost, it has completed the work that big box stores started, eliminating swaths of small, independent, brick-and-mortar businesses. Its online predatory pricing tactics have done the same for much of the e-commerce world.</p><p>That means shopping anywhere other than Amazon has become substantially more inconvenient. These tactics – Prime, DRM and predatory pricing – make it very hard <em>not</em> to shop at Amazon. With users locked in, to proceed with the enshittification playbook,&nbsp;Amazon needed to get its business customers locked in, too.</p><hr><h2 id="stage-2-abusing-users-good-to-businesses"><strong>Stage </strong><strong>2: abusing users, good to business</strong><strong>es</strong></h2><p>Amazon was initially very good to those business customers. It paid full price for their goods, then sold them below cost to its customers. It subsidised returns and customer service, too. It ran a clean search engine, which put the best matches for shoppers’ queries at the top of the page, creating a path to glory merchants could walk merely by selling quality goods at fair prices.</p><p>Then, once those merchants were locked in, Amazon put the screws on them. Amazon brags about this technique, which it calls “the flywheel”. It brings in users with low prices and a large selection. This attracts merchants who are eager to sell to those users. The merchants’ dependence on those customers allows Amazon to extract higher discounts from those merchants, and that brings in more users, which makes the platform even more indispensable for merchants, allowing the company to require even deeper discounts – and around and around the flywheel spins.</p><p>Let’s take a step back. This flywheel is the direct product of a radical legal theory that has had the world in its grip since the late 1970s. From the 1890s until the Jimmy Carter administration, US corporations’ power was blunted by antitrust law, which treated large companies as threats <em>simply because they were large</em>. Once a company is too big to fail, it becomes too big to jail, and then too big to care. Antitrust law was designed to fight that apathy and force companies to care.</p><p>A rival – and frankly terrible – theory of antitrust law says that the only time a government should intervene against a monopolist is when it is sure that the monopolist is using its scale to raise prices or lower quality. This is the consumer welfare standard theory and its premise is that when we find monopolies in the wild, they are almost certainly large and powerful thanks to the quality of their offerings. Any time you find that people all buy the same goods from the same store, you should assume that this is the very best store, selling the very best goods. It would be perverse (goes the theory) for the government to harass companies for being so excellent that everyone loves them.</p><p>It was under this theory that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jimmy-carter" data-link-name="in body link">Jimmy Carter</a> started to remove a few of the Jenga blocks from the antitrust system. Then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ronald-reagan" data-link-name="in body link">Ronald Reagan</a> came along and tore them out by the fistful. (Most of the rightwing policies for which we remember Reagan <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2023/04/27/much-of-ronald-reagans-presidency-was-foreshadowed-by-jimmy-carters-policies/" data-link-name="in body link">started under Carter</a>, who was hoping to woo conservative voters. He failed.) Every president since – Republican or Democrat – has followed Reagan’s example, up to (but not including) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden" data-link-name="in body link">Joe Biden</a>.</p><p>The Amazon flywheel is designed to fit neatly into the consumer welfare framework. It proclaims itself to be an enemy to merchants on behalf of consumers. The flywheel is all about lowering prices, and the consumer welfare standard theory prizes low prices above all else.</p><hr><h2 id="stage-3-a-giant-pile-of-shit"><strong>Stage </strong><strong>3: a giant pile of shit</strong></h2><p>Amazon has a myriad of tactics at its disposal for shifting value from business customers to itself, some of which also involve shifting value away from end users, no matter what the cute flywheel pitch says.</p><p>It uses its overview of merchants’ sales, as well as its ability to observe the return addresses on direct shipments from merchants’ contracting factories, to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/07/independent-uk-retailers-claim-1bn-damages-against-amazon" data-link-name="in body link">cream off its merchants’ bestselling items and clone them</a>, relegating the original seller to page umpty-million of its search results.</p><p>Amazon also crushes its merchants under a mountain of junk fees pitched as optional but effectively mandatory. Take Prime: a merchant has to give up a huge share of each sale to be included in Prime, and merchants that don’t use Prime are pushed so far down in the search results, they might as well cease to exist.</p><p>Same with <a href="https://sell.amazon.co.uk/fulfilment-by-amazon?ld=SEUKFBAAdGog-Top-Kwds_14921146748_129850349469_kwd-23792740295_e_565464207487_c_sig-Cj0KCQjw_rPGBhCbARIsABjq9cerrKp9B1eCyx3wzgQTJzVZozgQC7258a5neee6dQ9lMOd6qf4PaK4aAgfiEALw_wcB_asret_&amp;amp;id=go_cmp-14921146748_adg-129850349469_ad-565464207487_kwd-23792740295_devc_ext-_prd-" data-link-name="in body link">Fulfilment by Amazon</a>, a “service” in which a merchant sends its items to an Amazon warehouse to be packed and delivered with Amazon’s own inventory. This is far more expensive than comparable (or superior) shipping services from rival logistics companies, and a merchant that ships through one of those rivals is, again, relegated even farther down the search rankings.</p><p>All told, Amazon makes so much money charging merchants to deliver the wares they sell through the platform that its own shipping is fully subsidised. In other words, Amazon gouges its merchants so much that it pays nothing to ship its own goods, which compete directly with those merchants’ goods.</p><p>Here’s where Amazon’s attacks on its merchants’ bottom lines turn into higher prices for its customers. A merchant that pays Amazon through the nose needs to make up the money somewhere. Hypothetically, merchants could eat Amazon’s fees themselves – in other words, if Amazon wants a 10% fee on an item with a 20% profit margin, the seller could split the difference, and settle for a 10% profit.</p><p>But Amazon’s fee isn’t 10%. Add all the junk fees together and an Amazon seller is being screwed out of 45-51 cents on every dollar it earns there. Even if it wanted to absorb the “Amazon tax” on your behalf, it couldn’t. Merchants just don’t make 51% margins.</p><p>So merchants must jack up prices, which they do. A lot. Now, you may have noticed that Amazon’s prices aren’t any higher than the prices that you pay elsewhere. There’s a good reason for that: when merchants raise their prices on Amazon, they are required to raise their prices everywhere else, even on their own direct-sales stores. This arrangement is called most-favoured-nation status, and it’s key to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/26/amazon-antitrust-lawsuit-analysis-big-tech" data-link-name="in body link">US Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust lawsuit against Amazon</a>.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-34">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-34" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Let the implications of most-favoured nation settle in. If Amazon is taxing merchants 45-51 cents on every dollar they make, and if merchants are hiking their prices everywhere their goods are sold, then it follows you’re paying the Amazon tax no matter where you shop – even the corner mom-and-pop hardware store.</p><p>It gets worse. On average, the first result in an Amazon search is 29% more expensive than the best match for your search. Click any of the top four links on the top of your screen and you’ll pay an average of 25% more than you would for your best match – which, on average, is located 17 places down in an Amazon search result.</p><p>Why does this happen? Because Amazon makes more than <em>$</em><em>50b</em><em>n every year</em> charging merchants for search placement. When you search for a product on Amazon, the top results aren’t the best matches: they’re the matches that pay the highest fees to Amazon to be top of the list.</p><p>Researchers Rory Van Loo and Nikita Aggarwal call this “<a href="https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/3645/" data-link-name="in body link">Amazon’s pricing paradox</a>”. Amazon gets to insist that it has the lowest prices in the business, but no one can find those prices. Instead, we all pay a massive Amazon tax every time we shop there, <em>and</em> the merchants we buy from are paying an Amazon tax, too.</p><p>That means that, on average, the stuff at the top of an Amazon search results page is <em>bad</em>. It’s low-quality, high-priced junk. Even when you’re buying a known quantity, such as a specific brand of AA batteries, the top item will usually be more expensive than the items lower down on the page – the ones without the splashy banners advertising “Best Seller” or “Amazon’s Choice”. The Amazon smile logo gets a lot more sinister when it appears next to a top search result that costs 29% more than the best match for your query, thanks to Amazon’s $50bn-a-year paid search placement.</p><p>Not that you can find lower prices through anything as simple as sorting your search results by price. The merchants that dominate the search listings will play games with quantity to have the result with the lowest price, even if the price per unit is much higher. For example, a four-pack of AAs priced at $3.99 is more expensive per battery than a 16-pack priced at $10 (ie $1 versus $0.63), but sort-by-lowest-price will bury the better deal on the third or fourth page of results.</p><p>This is only the beginning. Amazon has clawed back value from buyers and sellers in many more ways. It underinvests in anti-fraud, so the top-scoring items with the highest user ratings are often terrible but are garlanded with (paid) rave reviews. Merchants with high-quality offerings are faced with two bad options: either they sink to the bottom of the rankings, or they cheat, too. If they <em>do</em> cheat, they’ll have to raise the prices of their merchandise in order to pay for the specialised fraud-as-a-service scum who gin up all those fake reviews. Then, if they get caught, they’ll be banished from Amazon and either go bust or have to start all over again under a new business name.</p><p>But for Amazon, all of this is fine. It’s how its system works, its flywheel. Amazon makes money when you are satisfied, and when you’re furious. The costs are borne by sellers, and by you. Why <em>would</em> the company invest in fighting fraud under those circumstances?</p><p>That’s also why Amazon puts so little effort into policing rotten sellers – and why so many of the “brands” there are consonant-heavy nonsense strings, seemingly generated at random by fly-by-nights that pop up and disappear, then pop up again under a new name.</p><p>This is end-stage enshittification. Amazon locked in its customers, then squeeeeezed, counting on a few good, desperate sellers to keep the system going. Then it clawed value away from its good sellers, leaving behind bad sellers that are a further source of misery for us.</p><p>Now Amazon is in the terminal stage. We’re all still stuck to the platform, but we get less and less value out of it. And because we’re all still there, buying Prime and starting (and ending) our purchase planning with Amazon’s enshittified search results, the merchants who rely on selling to us are stuck there, too, earning less and less from every sale.</p><p>The platform has turned into a pile of shit, and we’re at the bottom of it.</p><hr><p><span>A</span> confession: I am no true believer in markets as the best arbiter of how our society should work, who should be in charge of it and how its productive capacity should be organised. Like other leftists, I am deeply suspicious of capitalism. I understand the temptation to look at all this verbiage about enshittification, throw your hands up and say, “What do you expect? Capitalism always produces crises of production. Enshittification is just a sweary euphemism for capitalism.”</p><p>But this is wrong. There are meaningful differences between the internet as it stands today – the enshitternet – and the old, good internet we once had. The enshitternet is a source of pain, precarity and immiseration for the people we love. The indignities of harassment, scams, disinformation, surveillance, wage theft, extraction and rent-seeking have always been with us, but they were a minor sideshow on the old, good internet and they are the everything and all of the enshitternet.</p><p>This has real, material consequences for our comrades in the struggle for a better world. The internet that spawned <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy" data-link-name="in body link">Occupy</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement" data-link-name="in body link">Black Lives Matter </a>has become hostile to the maintenance of radical political movements and is inimical to the founding of new ones. That really matters. Not because the internet is the most important issue facing us today. Far from it. Compared with the climate emergency, genocide, inequality, corruption, democratic backsliding, authoritarianism and sustained racist, homophobic, misogynist and transphobic attacks, the internet is just a sideshow. But the internet is the terrain upon which these fights will be waged. It is the communications medium we will use to organise to save our species and planet from their imminent eradication. We can’t win these fights without a free, fair and open internet.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/18/my-hero-audre-lorde-jackie-kay" data-link-name="in body link">Audre Lorde</a> was far smarter than I am about nearly everything, but when she wrote, “<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/audre-lorde-the-master-s-tools-will-never-dismantle-the-master-s-house" data-link-name="in body link">The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house</a>”, she was manifestly wrong. The master’s tools were used to build that house in the first place – that makes them the ideal tools to take it to bits and rebuild it to shelter us.</p><p>We can halt the creeping enshittification of every digital device. We can build a better, enshittification-resistant digital nervous system, one fit to coordinate the mass movements we will need to fight fascism, end genocide and save our planet and our species.</p><figure id="d30261f5-99f3-45df-9c5e-0edbb4e70d5f" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:54,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;‘My house filled with stuff while my bank account drained’: how I stopped impulse buying&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;d30261f5-99f3-45df-9c5e-0edbb4e70d5f&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/feb/27/how-to-stop-impulse-buying&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>You won’t be able to do it alone. Your personal consumption choices might make a difference to the merchants you patronise, but they have no effect on the policies that created our enshittogenic environment. Just as you can’t save the planet by diligently sorting your recycling, you can’t stop enshittification by “voting with your wallet” (those votes are always won by those with the thickest wallets, and that’s the billionaires who made money by enshittifying everything).</p><p>Take Amazon: to fix Amazon, we need policy solutions. We need to ban predatory pricing – selling goods below cost to keep competitors out of the market (and then jacking them up again). We need to impose structural separation on the company so it can either be a platform, or compete with the sellers that rely on it as a platform. We need to curb its junk fees, which suck 45-51 cents on every dollar merchants take in. We need to end its most favoured nation deal, which forces merchants who raise their prices on Amazon to pay these fees to raise their prices everywhere else, too. We need to unionise its drivers and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/amazon-diaries" data-link-name="in body link">warehouse workers</a>. We need to treat its rigged search results as the fraud they are.</p><p>The path to a better Amazon doesn’t lie through consumer activism, or appeals to the its conscience. Corporations, being artificial, immortal colony-organisms that use humans as their inconvenient gut flora, do not have consciences to appeal to. The path leads through coalitions: of consumers and merchants who are tired of being robbed; of workers who are tired of being immiserated and maimed; of competitors who are tired of being strong-armed by a monopolist bully; of tax-justice activists who are tired of trillion-dollar multinationals ducking their obligations. Systemic problems have systemic solutions, not individual ones. You can’t shop your way out of a monopoly.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/martin-luther-king" data-link-name="in body link">Martin Luther King Jr </a>once said, “It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can stop him from lynching me, and I think that’s pretty important, also.”</p><p>It may be true that regulation can’t force corporate sociopaths to conceive of you as a human being entitled to dignity and fair treatment, and not just an ambulatory wallet, a supply of gut bacteria for the immortal colony organism that is a limited liability corporation. But it can make that exec fear you enough to treat you fairly and afford you dignity, even if he doesn’t think you deserve it.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>Today, we’re introducing new capabilities for managing your agents’ context on the Claude Developer Platform: context editing and the memory tool.</p><p>With our latest model, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude Sonnet 4.5</a>, these capabilities enable developers to build AI agents capable of handling long-running tasks at higher performance and without hitting context limits or losing critical information.</p><h2 id="context-windows-have-limits-but-real-work-doesnt">Context windows have limits, but real work doesn’t</h2><p>As production agents handle more complex tasks and generate more tool results, they often exhaust their effective context windows—leaving developers stuck choosing between cutting agent transcripts or degrading performance. Context management solves this in two ways, helping developers ensure only relevant data stays in context and valuable insights get preserved across sessions.</p><p><strong>Context editing</strong> automatically clears stale tool calls and results from within the context window when approaching token limits. As your agent executes tasks and accumulates tool results, context editing removes stale content while preserving the conversation flow, effectively extending how long agents can run without manual intervention. This also increases the effective model performance as Claude focuses only on relevant context.</p><div><figure><img alt="Visualization comparing available context before context editing and after context editing." loading="lazy" width="1920" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8ad2952bc0513750088cdfd309ee83ba0fd15438-1920x800.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8ad2952bc0513750088cdfd309ee83ba0fd15438-1920x800.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8ad2952bc0513750088cdfd309ee83ba0fd15438-1920x800.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure></div><p><strong>The memory tool</strong> enables Claude to store and consult information outside the context window through a file-based system. Claude can create, read, update, and delete files in a dedicated memory directory stored in your infrastructure that persists across conversations. This allows agents to build up knowledge bases over time, maintain project state across sessions, and reference previous learnings without having to keep everything in context.</p><p>The memory tool operates entirely client-side through tool calls. Developers manage the storage backend, giving them complete control over where the data is stored and how it’s persisted.</p><p>Claude Sonnet 4.5 enhances both capabilities with built-in context awareness—tracking available tokens throughout conversations to manage context more effectively.</p><p>Together, these updates create a system that improves agent performance:</p><ul><li>Enable longer conversations by automatically removing stale tool results from context</li><li>Boost accuracy by saving critical information to memory—and bring that learning across successive agentic sessions</li></ul><h2 id="building-long-running-agents">Building long-running agents</h2><p>Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the best model in the world for building agents. These features unlock new possibilities for long-running agents—processing entire codebases, analyzing hundreds of documents, or maintaining extensive tool interaction histories. Context management builds on this foundation, ensuring agents can leverage this expanded capacity efficiently while still handling workflows that extend beyond any fixed limit. Use cases include:</p><ul><li><strong>Coding:</strong> Context editing clears old file reads and test results while memory preserves debugging insights and architectural decisions, enabling agents to work on large codebases without losing progress.</li><li><strong>Research: </strong>Memory stores key findings while context editing removes old search results, building knowledge bases that improve performance over time.</li><li><strong>Data processing: </strong>Agents store intermediate results in memory while context editing clears raw data, handling workflows that would otherwise exceed token limits.</li></ul><h2 id="performance-improvements-with-context-management">Performance improvements with context management</h2><p>On an internal evaluation set for agentic search, we tested how context management improves agent performance on complex, multi-step tasks. The results demonstrate significant gains: combining the memory tool with context editing improved performance by 39% over baseline. Context editing alone delivered a 29% improvement.</p><p>In a 100-turn web search evaluation, context editing enabled agents to complete workflows that would otherwise fail due to context exhaustion—while reducing token consumption by 84%.</p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2><p>These capabilities are available today in public beta on the Claude Developer Platform, natively and in Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI.

<p>Public awareness of legal sports betting has grown in recent years – and so has the perception that it is a bad thing for society and sports, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.</p>

<p>Today, 43% of U.S. adults say the fact that sports betting is now legal in much of the country is a <strong>bad thing for society. </strong>That’s up from <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/09/14/as-more-states-legalize-the-practice-19-of-u-s-adults-say-they-have-bet-money-on-sports-in-the-past-year/">34% in 2022</a>. And 40% of adults now say it’s a <strong>bad thing for sports,</strong> up from 33%.</p>



<p>Despite these increasingly critical views of legal sports betting, many Americans continue to say it has neither a bad nor good impact on society and on sports. Fewer than one-in-five see positive impacts.</p>



<details><summary>About this research</summary>
<p>This Pew Research Center analysis examines recent changes in Americans’ awareness of, attitudes about and personal experiences with sports betting. It comes as more states <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/events/details/sports-betting-on-the-rise-as-states-let-gamblers-wager-online">legalize the practice</a>.</p>



<h4 id="2c86970a0dfb1a0fb6143626d475626a">Why did we do this?</h4>



<p>The Center conducts high-quality research to inform the public, journalists and decision-makers. Studying the public’s views of and experiences with sports betting is part of our long-standing research on social trends, technology and related topics.</p>

<h4 id="61af5ad1ffc78809f7ec505aec15ab69">How did we do this?</h4>



<p>This analysis is based on findings from a survey of 9,916 U.S. adults who are part of the Center’s American Trends Panel. The survey was conducted from July 8 to Aug. 3, 2025. The survey’s overall margin of error is plus or minus 1.3 percentage points.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the share of Americans who have bet money on sports in the past year has not changed much since 2022.</p>



<p>Today, 22% of adults say they’ve<strong> personally bet money on sports in the past year.</strong> That’s a slight uptick from 19% three years ago. This figure includes betting in any of three ways:</p>



<ul>
<li>With friends or family, such as in a private betting pool, fantasy league or casual bet</li>



<li>Online with a betting app, sportsbook or casino</li>



<li>In person at a casino, racetrack or betting kiosk</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this increase has come through <strong>online sports betting:</strong> 10% of adults now say they’ve placed a bet this way in the past year, up from 6% in 2022. There has been no change in the shares of adults who have bet on sports with family or friends or in person at a casino, racetrack or betting kiosk.</p>



<p>Commercial sports betting has spread rapidly across the United States since a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/us/politics/supreme-court-sports-betting-new-jersey.html">Supreme Court ruling in 2018</a> gave states the green light to legalize it. At least 38 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico now allow commercial sports betting in some form, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/events/details/sports-betting-on-the-rise-as-states-let-gamblers-wager-online">according to the National Conference of State Legislatures</a>.</p>



<p>In our new survey, 63% of adults say they’ve heard or read a lot or a little about the fact that sports betting is now legal in much of the U.S. That’s up from 56% in 2022. The increase in public awareness comes as betting-related advertisements <a href="https://www.espn.com/espn/betting/story/_/id/44716101/sports-betting-ads-tv-versus-alcohol-study-fantasy-spending-volume">have become common during sports broadcasts</a>.</p>



<p>The rest of this analysis takes a closer look at Americans’ views of and experiences with sports betting. It’s based on the survey of 9,916 U.S. adults, conducted in July and August.</p>

<p>Since 2022, Americans in many demographic groups have become more likely to view the widespread legalization of sports betting as a bad thing for society, as well as for sports.</p>



<p>This is true for men and women; college graduates and non-college graduates; and upper-, middle- and lower-income Americans alike. It is also the case among Democrats and Republicans, as well as among those who have personally placed a sports bet in the past year and those who have not.</p>



<p>Some of the biggest shifts in attitudes about sports betting’s societal impact have come among young Americans – especially young men. <strong>Today, 47% of men under 30 say legal sports betting is a bad thing for society, up from 22% who said this in 2022.</strong> Women under 30 have also become more likely to express this view: 35% see legal sports betting as bad for society, up from 25% three years ago.</p>



<p>The legalization of sports betting has <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/state/sports-betting-tax-revenue/">generated revenue for state governments and gambling operators</a>, but it has also raised concerns about <a href="https://www.ncpgambling.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sports-gambling_NCPGLitRvwExecSummary.pdf">gambling addiction</a> and other societal harms. Critics have also cautioned that it may <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2025/08/bad-bets-the-new-culture-of-sports-gambling/">compromise the integrity of sports</a>. In recent years, several professional and college athletes and team personnel have been punished for violating betting rules.</p>



<details><summary>Recent betting violations in professional sports</summary>
<p>The largest professional sports leagues in North America – including the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Hockey League (NHL) and Major League Soccer (MLS) – ban players, and often coaches and other personnel, from betting on their own sports. In some cases, there are also rules about betting on <em>other</em> sports. Punishments for violating the rules range from fines or suspensions to lifetime bans.</p>



<p>Since the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/us/politics/supreme-court-sports-betting-new-jersey.html">U.S. Supreme Court’s 2018 decision to allow sports betting</a>, at least 20 professional athletes in these five leagues – as well as one NFL coach and one MLB umpire – have faced disciplinary action for violating their leagues’ gambling policies. All but four of these disciplinary actions took place in 2023 and 2024, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of league announcements and media reports.</p>



<p>More than half of the athletes who have faced disciplinary action (11 of 20) were from the NFL. The rest involved players from MLB (five), MLS (two), the NBA (one) and the NHL (one).</p>



<p>In most cases, players received suspensions, ranging from several games to indefinite. However, in 2024, an <a href="https://abc7news.com/post/tucupita-marcano-gets-lifetime-mlb-ban-betting-baseball/14909938/">MLB player</a> and an <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/jontay-porter-banned-from-nba">NBA player</a> each received permanent bans for betting on their own teams’ games.</p>

<p>As was the case in 2022, some groups of Americans are more likely than others to say they’ve personally bet money on sports in the past year in any of the ways we asked about.</p>



<p><strong>Young adults are more likely than older Americans to say they’ve placed a sports bet in the past year.</strong> Some 31% of adults under 30 say this, including 36% of men and 29% of women in this age group. Sports betting is less common in all older age groups.</p>



<p><strong>Black and Hispanic adults are also especially likely to have bet money on sports in the past year:</strong> 30% and 27%, respectively, say they have done so. Roughly two-in-ten Asian (22%) and White (19%) adults say the same.</p>



<p>There are no differences between college graduates and non-college graduates on this question. In each group, 22% say they have bet on sports in the past year. Nor are there major partisan differences: 24% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they have done so, as have 22% of Republicans and Republican leaners.</p>



<h4 id="who-has-placed-an-online-sports-bet-in-the-past-year">Who has placed an online sports bet in the past year?</h4>



<p>When it comes to <em>online </em>sports betting, young adults and Black Americans again stand out.</p>



<p>Overall, 17% of adults under 30 – including 21% of men and 16% of women in this age group – say they’ve placed an online sports wager in the past year. Three years ago, 7% of those under 30 had done so – including 9% of men and 6% of women.</p>



<p>Among Black adults, 19% say they’ve placed an online sports bet in the past year, up from 10% in 2022. Smaller shares of Hispanic (12%), Asian (11%) and White (8%) adults say they’ve done this in the past year.</p>

				<h2 id="user-content-testing-1password" dir="auto">Testing 1Password</h2>
<p dir="auto">In October of 2023, I reported a vulnerability to 1Password regarding their <code>op</code> (a.k.a. <code>1password-cli</code>) program. In my report I detailed that their approach to prompting users only once, and then leaving the vault open to the CLI was easily exploited in supply-chain scenarios, especially when a threat actor targets developer toolchains. There are two attack paths I highlighted, and I supplied them with a proof for one of them.</p>

<p dir="auto">This demo was tested across the three most recent versions of macOS, using <code>zsh</code> and <code>bash</code> shells using the latest 1Password desktop client.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-two-attack-paths" dir="auto">Two Attack Paths</h2>
<p dir="auto">Both attacks would be a supply-chain attack, but there are two distinct paths:</p>
<h3 id="user-content-ide-path" dir="auto">IDE Path</h3>
<p dir="auto">The IDE path is pretty straight-forward, and I think carries the greatest risk:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>I install the 1Password extension because I responsibly wish to keep my tokens in a safe place (e.g. not my <code>$ENV</code>)</li>
<li>I also use the MySQL extension in my IDE, it's nice to be able to stay in the same tool</li>
<li>I use the 1Password extension to resolve secret references, which requires me to unlock my vault</li>
<li>I installed a new red theme, red is my favorite color</li>
<li>That red theme is an extension, and contained malicious code which uses the <code>op</code> NPM module to enumerate and exfiltrate <em>every</em> vault that I have access to</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="user-content-package-manager-path" dir="auto">Package manager path</h3>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>I install the 1Password CLI, and I use <code>op</code> to protect secrets in my environment</li>
<li>I use GitHub Packages for NPM packages which are private to my organization</li>
<li>I hear of a really nifty plugin which will allow me to add syntax highlighting to shell output on this CLI project I'm working on, so I <code>npm i syntax-highlighting-stuff</code></li>
<li>Oh no! <code>syntax-highlighting-stuff</code> had a <code>post-install</code> script on it, and it enumerated and exfiltrated the secrets from <em>every</em> vault I have access to</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="user-content-observed-patterns" dir="auto">Observed patterns</h3>
<p dir="auto">It seems like the vulnerability is that once you unlock your vault, anything spawned from the parent process of whatever opened the vault retains an active session to that open vault.</p>
<pre><code>$ op run -- ls <span># This prompts me to unlock my vault</span>
$ op run -- ls <span># The second call does not prompt me, the vault is already open</span>
$ op <span>read</span> <span>'op://Foo/Bar/baz'</span> <span># Still doesn't prompt me again because the vault is still open</span>
</code></pre><p dir="auto">This also works with subprocesses:</p>
<pre><code>$ <span>export</span> <span>GITHUB_TOKEN</span><span>=</span><span>'op://Foo/Bar/baz'</span>
$ op run -- env <span>|</span> grep GITHUB_TOKEN <span># This will prompt me</span>
$ bash <span># Start a new shell subprocess</span>
$ op run -- env <span>|</span> grep GITHUB_TOKEN <span># This will not prompt me</span>
$ bash <span># Now we're two shells deep in subprocesses</span>
$ op run -- env <span>|</span> grep GITHUB_TOKEN <span># This will still not prompt me</span>
</code></pre><h2 id="user-content-the-proof" dir="auto">The Proof</h2>
<p dir="auto">This repository contains the code from the proof that I submitted to 1Password on 2nd October, 2023. Here are the instructions for running the proof:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The <code>index.cjs</code> has a module which runs the <code>naughty</code> module.</li>
<li>Either using netcat or <a href="https://codeberg.org/manchicken/simple-exfil-service.git" rel="nofollow"><code>simple-exfil-service</code></a>, listen on port <code>4242</code></li>
<li>To run this test, simply run <code>op run npm install</code> like you needed a GitHub token</li>
<li>Afterward, check your output from port 4242, but also check to see if there is a <code>/tmp/naughty</code> file</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Here's what the person running <code>npm i</code> would see:</p>

</code></pre><p dir="auto">Notice that the <code>value</code> for the <code>password</code> is in plaintext in both cases.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-the-risk" dir="auto">The Risk</h2>
<p dir="auto">The 1Password CLI is marketed as a tool which makes technical practitioners safer by protecting credentials that are traditionally stored in plaintext in a user's environment variables on their local machine. This vulnerability demonstrates that while this does get the secrets out of your environment, it also <em>drastically</em> expands the potential blast radius for a successful malware or supply-chain attack.</p>
<p dir="auto">To put it simply: the risk here is not that your GitHub secret will be leaked via an environment variable, the risk is that <em>every vault you have access to</em> could be dumped by a threat actor.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, as agentic AI tools become more commonplace, that may add additional risk factors which have yet to be considered in the research I'm presenting here.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>op</code> tool doesn't just possess the ability to get individual items, it also has the ability to enumerate your vaults (<code>op vault list</code>) and to enumerate items in a given vault (<code>op item list --vault abc123</code>). <a href="https://github.com/1Password/op-js?tab=readme-ov-file#available-commands-and-functions" rel="nofollow">The JavaScript module supports all of the same commands</a> that the <code>op</code> CLI tool does, too.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-attempts-to-mitigate" dir="auto">Attempts to Mitigate</h2>
<p dir="auto">I have explored a number of paths to mitigate this.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Following the suggestion of a colleague, I experimented with using a separate vault for CLI secrets
<ul dir="auto">
<li>This doesn't work because you cannot limit the default vault from being read by the CLI</li>
<li>Not only that, but you can't set limits for things like shared vaults</li>
<li>As weird as it sounds, when you unlock one vault, you unlock all vaults which are accessible to the CLI tool</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1Password recommended using service accounts to mitigate this, and I did try it, but I found some challenges as I started thinking of how to roll it out to teams
<ul dir="auto">
<li>This kinda sucks because that means each developer gets a separate service account user on their workstation</li>
<li>This also means that the developer has to manage a service account</li>
<li>In addition to being unweildy, this also means that each engineer must be diligent to <em>not</em> enable the shiny "Integrate with 1Password CLI" button in the Developer tab on the GUI settings</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-content-recommendations" dir="auto">Recommendations</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>I recommend that folks avoid using <code>op</code> on developer workstations until 1Password has released a fix for these scenarios
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The best way to do this appears to be to make sure CLI integration checkbox is <em>unchecked</em> in the Developer settings screen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I recommend that when you <em>must</em> use <code>op</code>, that it be limited to service accounts, per 1Password's recommendation, and that you carefully verify that the "Integrate with 1Password CLI" box is unchecked in the GUI settings</li>
<li>I recomment that, where possible, you get in the habit of always passing <code>--ignore-scripts</code> to <code>npm</code> commands, and find a similar pattern for any other package manager that you use in conjunction with <code>op</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">I strongly recommend that 1Password modify their product to resolve this problem. Just spitballing, I think any of the following would be sufficient (this is an OR, not an AND):</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Allow users to limit access to vaults using CLI integrations</li>
<li>Allow users to designate individual items in their Vaults for use with the CLI</li>
<li>Prompt for specific vaults or items individually</li>
<li>Prompt for each process individually, closing the gap for subprocesses</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-content-conclusion" dir="auto">Conclusion</h2>
<p dir="auto">This investigation took a while, and I waited a while before publishing this disclosure (life circumstances and giving 1Password time to fix the issue). While 1Password is within their right not to issue a CVE or a fix for this vulnerability, I do think 1Password users (I am proud to be one) would be much safer if this issue were eliminated.</p>
<p dir="auto">Thanks, please contact me with any corrections or feedback.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Most of the heavy lifting features are provided by / built into sqlc, I do not aim to take credit for them.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">☑️ Supports SQlite, PostgreSQL and MySQL.<br>
☑️ Multiple queries per file.<br>
☑️ Database client agnostic.<br>
☑️ Utility wrappers for popular gleam database libraries (<a href="https://github.com/lpil/sqlight">lpil/sqlight</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lpil/pog">lpil/pog</a>).<br>
☑️ Automatically pulls the schema of your database.<br>
☑️ Automatically downloads <a href="https://sqlc.dev/" rel="nofollow">sqlc</a> binary.<br>
☑️ Named parameters.<sup>*1</sup> <br></p>
<p dir="auto"><sup>*1</sup>: Meaning that it infers the names of the parameters from your sql queries in the gleam function you call. for example for a query called <code>FindUser</code>, defined as <code>SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = $1</code>, parrot will produce a function where the arguments match those column names: <code>pub fn find_user(username: String) { ... }</code>. If you have multiple parameters of the same data types this can avoid confusion and bugs.</p>

<p dir="auto">As with everything in software, there are some quirks with this library, due to
the nature of your database of choice and sqlc.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Multidimensional Arrays</h3><a id="user-content-multidimensional-arrays" aria-label="Permalink: Multidimensional Arrays" href="#multidimensional-arrays"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you have an <code>INTEGER[][]</code> column in Postgres, <code>pg_dump</code> does not correctly identify
the column as a two-dimensional array and therefore only gives you a <code>List(Int)</code> instead
of a <code>List(List(Int))</code>. If this is a problem for you, you can raise an issue and
we might come up with a solution or workaround.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dynamic Data Types</h3><a id="user-content-dynamic-data-types" aria-label="Permalink: Dynamic Data Types" href="#dynamic-data-types"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are a couple of complex data types that are explictly made <code>dynamic</code>
since they are too complex to handle with the current implementation.
There is a plan for a better and more flexible implementation. Until then,
it will be wrapped in a dynamic type.</p>

<p dir="auto">So here is the catch: you can only execute parrot in an erlang gleam application.
However the generated code will also run in a javascript environment.
So if you need parrot for a javascript project, you can create a separate package and
copy over the generated module and that will work.</p>

<p dir="auto">This library supports everything that <a href="https://sqlc.dev/" rel="nofollow">sqlc</a> supports. As the time of this writing that
would be MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQlite.</p>

<h2>2025.10.04: NSA and IETF: <span>Can an attacker simply purchase standardization of weakened cryptography? #pqcrypto #hybrids #nsa #ietf #antitrust</span></h2>
<p>It's normal for post-quantum cryptography
to be rolled out as an <em>extra</em> layer of security on top of traditional pre-quantum cryptography,
rather than as a <em>replacement</em>.</p>
<p>For example,
Google's <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html">CECPQ1</a> experiment
was double encryption with
traditional pre-quantum ECC
(specifically
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#safecurves">X25519</a>)
and post-quantum NewHope1024.
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment/">CECPQ2</a>,
a joint experiment between Google and Cloudflare,
was ECC+NTRUHRSS701.
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment/">CECPQ2b</a>
was ECC+SIKEp434.
<a href="https://ssh-comparison.quendi.de/comparison/kex.html">Ten SSH implementations</a>
support ECC+sntrup761.
Today's usage of post-quantum cryptography by browsers is
<a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#post-quantum-encryption-adoption">approaching half</a>
of the connections seen by Cloudflare,
where
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/vtMTuE_3u-0/m/k6JisLwXAQAJ">95% of that</a>
is ECC+MLKEM768
and 5% is ECC+Kyber768.</p>
<p>If post-quantum cryptography is designed to be super-strong,
so strong that it even survives future quantum computers,
then why are we keeping the ECC layer?
Same reason that you wear your seatbelt:
in the real world, cars sometimes crash, and seatbelts reduce the damage.</p>
<p>Google already explained this back in
<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html">2016</a>:
"The post-quantum algorithm might turn out to be breakable even with today's computers,
in which case the elliptic-curve algorithm will still provide the best security that today's technology can offer."
We've seen
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#qrcsp">many breaks of post-quantum proposals</a>
since then,
including the sudden
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/975">public</a>
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1026">collapse</a>
of SIKE
three years after CECPQ2b applied SIKE to
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment/">tens of millions</a> of user connections.
The <em>only</em> reason that this user data wasn't immediately exposed to attackers
is that CECPQ2b encrypted data with SIKE <em>and</em> with ECC,
rather than switching from ECC to just SIKE.
As another example,
the reference Kyber/ML-KEM software went through two rounds of security patches for
<a href="https://kyberslash.cr.yp.to/">KyberSlash</a> at the end of 2023,
and then had
<a href="https://pqshield.com/pqshield-plugs-timing-leaks-in-kyber-ml-kem-to-improve-pqc-implementation-maturity/">another security patch</a>
in mid-2024.</p>
<p>Deploying ECC+PQ rather than just PQ is an easy common-sense win.
ECC software is practically everywhere anyway,
and nobody has identified an application that can afford PQ without being able to afford ECC+PQ.</p>
<p>Typically people talk about deploying ECC+PQ as deploying "hybrids" rather than "non-hybrids",
although you have to be careful with this terminology
since the word "hybrid" also has other meanings in cryptography.
It's more descriptive to talk about
"double encryption" and "double signatures"
rather than
"single encryption" and "single signatures".</p>
<p><strong><a name="problem">The problem in a nutshell.</a></strong>
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20250930-stealth.html#nsa">Surveillance agency</a>
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-nsa-spying/u-s-court-mass-surveillance-program-exposed-by-snowden-was-illegal-idUSKBN25T3CK/">NSA</a>
and its
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/01/nsa-paid-gchq-spying-edward-snowden">partner</a>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/25/gchqs-mass-data-sharing-violated-right-to-privacy-court-rules">GCHQ</a>
are trying to have standards-development organizations
endorse weakening ECC+PQ down to just PQ.</p>
<p>Part of this is that
NSA and GCHQ have been endlessly repeating arguments that this weakening is a <em>good</em> thing
(in much the same way that NSA advertised
<a href="https://projectbullrun.org/dual-ec/index.html">Dual EC</a>
as providing
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250902084755/https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/events/random-number-generation-workshop-2004/documents/numbertheoreticdrbg.pdf">"increased assurance"</a>).
I have a previous blog post showing that
those arguments <a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20240102-hybrid.html">collapse upon examination</a>.
But that's not today's topic.
In today's blog post I'm instead looking at
how easy it is for NSA to simply spend money to corrupt the standardization process.</p>
<p><strong><a name="tls">Two TLS encryption drafts.</a></strong>
For concreteness,
I'll focus on what's happening in a particular standards-development organization
called the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
Within that,
I'll focus on current proposals within an IETF "working group" (WG)
that sets standards for Transport Layer Security (TLS),
the security layer inside HTTPS and inside various other protocols.
I'll look specifically at how the TLS WG handled
two drafts specifying post-quantum encryption mechanisms for TLS:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hybrid (double encryption):
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250710085814/https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-kwiatkowski-tls-ecdhe-mlkem-03.html">"Post-quantum hybrid ECDHE-MLKEM Key Agreement for TLSv1.3"</a>.
  This draft specifies ECC+PQ in TLS,
  specifically usage in TLS of "X25519MLKEM768, SecP256r1MLKEM768, and SecP384r1MLKEM1024".
  The first of those is also what I mentioned above as
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/vtMTuE_3u-0/m/k6JisLwXAQAJ">95%</a>
  of current post-quantum connections to Cloudflare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-hybrid (single encryption):
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250718131345/https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement-05.html">"ML-KEM Post-Quantum Key Agreement for TLS 1.3"</a>.
  This draft specifies usage in TLS of "ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024" without seatbelts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The non-hybrid draft was first posted in March 2024.
Of course someone asked "what the motivation is for being 'fully post-quantum' rather than hybrid".
The draft author
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/qFRxBSnEPJcdlt7MO0cIL2kW5qc/">responded</a>:
"FIPS / CNSA 2.0 compliance guidelines ...
currently are a big 'maybe' at best for 'hybrid solutions', and the
timetables for compliant browsers, servers, and services are to exclusively
use FIPS 203 at level V (ML-KEM-1024) by 2033. I figure there will be
demand for pure ML-KEM key agreement, not hybrid (with no questions that
come along with it of whether it's actually allowed or not)."</p>
<p>As context,
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States">massive U.S. military budget</a>
now publicly requires cryptographic "components" to have
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221022163808/https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Library/Instructions/CJCSI%206510.02F.pdf?ver=qUEnOsWpGPcGGMFTb4yYVA%3D%3D">NSA approval</a>.
"CNSA 2.0" refers to a public NSA document
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240927153634/https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/07/2003071834/-1/-1/0/CSA_CNSA_2.0_ALGORITHMS_.PDF">"Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0"</a>.
The document says up front that its requirements apply to
"all NSS use of public cryptographic algorithms (as opposed to algorithms NSA developed),
including those on all unclassified and classified NSS".
The <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/us/title-40/subtitle-iii/chapter-111/sec-11103/">legal definition</a>
of "national security system" (NSS)
covers practically all military information systems,
except for "routine administrative and business applications" such as "payroll".</p>
<p>In June 2024,
NSA's William Layton
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/ESCdYNwVeF4VkvoORFJLJk_87VU/">wrote</a>
that "we do not anticipate supporting hybrid in NSS".</p>
<p>In December 2024, a Cisco employee
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/S9Mwv28VEHrG189ZtoubUani7J8/">wrote</a>
the following:
"There are people whose
cryptographic expertise I cannot doubt who say that pure ML-KEM is the
right trade-off for them, and more importantly for my employer, that's
what they're willing to buy.  Hence, Cisco will implement it; I am
essentially just asking for code points."
Certainly "willing to buy" is a statement about funding,
evidently from a source large enough to dictate Cisco actions,
evidently from a source asking for non-hybrids,
evidently from "people whose cryptographic expertise I cannot doubt";
if that source isn't NSA, who is it?</p>
<p>(Side note: If you think the word "pure" in "pure ML-KEM" sounds good,
remember that replacing CECPQ2's ECC+SIKE with "pure SIKE" would have been a disaster.)</p>
<p>In June 2025,
NSA's Mike Jenkins
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/spasm/xUKIoHQwm1BjNZWS2x3xb-BhsLI/">posted</a>
the following:
"As the CNSA 2.0 profiles should make clear, we are looking for products that support /standalone/ ML-DSA-87 and /standalone/ ML-KEM-1024. If there is one vendor
that produces one product that complies, then that is the product that goes on the compliance list and is approved for use. Our interactions with vendors suggests
that this won't be a problem in most cases."
Evidently there are many companies happy to jump when NSA says jump.</p>
<p><strong><a name="dogfood">Pretending to eat your own dog food.</a></strong>
For software engineers,
"dogfooding"
(a term
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120406142929/http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/317315/vmworld_2009_virtualization_controversy_eating_your_own_dog_food/?fp=39&amp;fpid=25874&amp;rid=1">perhaps</a>
coined by Paul Maritz in the 1980s)
refers to making regular use of the software that you're writing.
This builds your confidence that the software works,
and helps iron out problems.</p>
<p>But there's also a marketing version of the same concept,
where you publicly <em>say</em> that you're using your own software
as a way to build <em>other people's</em> confidence in the software.
As in other types of marketing,
what you're saying doesn't have to be true.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, NSA
<a href="https://archive.org/details/cold_war_iii-nsa/cold_war_iii-ISCAP/page/n239/mode/2up">weakened</a>
the Data Encryption Standard to just 56 bits.
In public,
NSA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220805195031/https://cryptome.org/nsa-inman-1979.pdf">claimed</a>
that it hadn't tampered with the standard,
and that the
"implausibility of public allegations is further demonstrated by the fact that
NSA has endorsed the use of DES for the encryption of national security-related information,
including selected classified information".</p>
<p>This is powerful marketing.
Many people hearing this last quote will think
"Oh, okay, NSA is using DES, so DES is strong".
Koblitz and Menezes
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151122060827/https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1018.pdf">claimed</a>
that it's "far-fetched"
that NSA would have intentionally selected something weak
"for U.S. government usage (for both unclassified and classified communications [41])".
Many people today will think
"Oh, okay, NSA is buying single encryption, so double encryption is unimportant".</p>
<p>But DES <a href="https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/27.pdf">wasn't</a> strong.
NSA had engineered DES to be
<a href="https://archive.org/details/cold_war_iii-nsa/cold_war_iii-ISCAP/page/n239/mode/2up">"weak enough"</a>
for NSA to break.
NSA wanted DES to
<a href="https://archive.org/details/cold_war_iii-nsa/cold_war_iii-ISCAP/page/n239/mode/2up">"drive out competitors"</a>,
to "reduce the field that NSA had to be concerned about".</p>
<p>It's perfectly plausible that NSA was using DES,
but surely NSA was then using DES multiple times (Triple-DES or beyond),
which makes it much harder to break
(as long as you <a href="https://sweet32.info/">switch keys frequently</a>).
Obviously NSA wouldn't have said "use multiple layers" publicly:
NSA wanted to fool people into thinking that DES was secure.</p>
<p>Today we have better ciphers than DES.
However, for data that it cares about,
NSA still uses two independent encryption layers
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220524232250/https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/75/documents/resources/everyone/csfc/threat-prevention.pdf">"to mitigate the ability of an adversary to exploit a single cryptographic implementation"</a>.
Gee, maybe multiple encryption is important after all!</p>
<p>Try to put yourself in
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20250930-stealth.html">the mindset of NSA as an attacker</a>.
You have a
<a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2014/04/09/20130905-guard-sigint_enabling.pdf">massive budget</a>
to "covertly influence and/or overtly leverage" systems
to "make the systems in question exploitable";
"to the consumer and other adversaries, however, the systems' security remains intact".
One of your action items is to "influence policies, standards and specification
for commercial public key technologies".
Another is to "shape the worldwide commercial cryptography marketplace
to make it more tractable to advanced cryptanalytic capabilities being developed by NSA/CSS".</p>
<p>You spend this money pursuing many different attack paths,
taking whatever surveillance wins you can get.
It's not that <em>everybody</em> was using Dual EC,
for example,
but you managed to manipulate <em>some</em> people into using it,
and for you that's a win.</p>
<p>Weakening ECC+PQ to just PQ,
normalizing the practice of driving without seatbelts,
is another win for you as the attacker.
It's adding further vulnerabilities to the cryptographic ecosystem.
The point is that,
beyond SIKE and <a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#qrcsp">many other</a> publicly broken cryptosystems,
there will be some further cases where
your "advanced cryptanalytic capabilities" break the PQ part
while the "consumer and other adversaries" think the PQ part is secure.</p>
<p>What do you do with your control over the U.S. military budget?
That's another opportunity to "shape the worldwide commercial cryptography marketplace".
You can tell people that you won't authorize purchasing double encryption.
You can even follow through on having the military publicly purchase single encryption.
Meanwhile you quietly spend a negligible amount of money on an independent encryption layer
to protect the data that you care about,
so you're actually using double encryption.</p>
<p><strong><a name="callgood">Adoption of double encryption in TLS.</a></strong>
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7221">"Adoption"</a>
in IETF is a preliminary step before standardization:
when a WG is
"ready to develop a particular document, the most common mechanism is
for it to 'adopt' an existing document as a starting point".</p>
<p>In March 2025,
after the close of a two-week "WG adoption call",
the TLS WG chairs declared
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250419105450/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/iGLZeIYzsIZPYO1ezA2Eulv5x98/">"consensus to adopt"</a>
the "Post-quantum hybrid ECDHE-MLKEM Key Agreement for TLSv1.3" draft.</p>
<p>There were no objections to the declaration of consensus on adopting this draft.
I had pointed out that the patents on Kyber/ML-KEM create two issues related to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250405080704/https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8179/">IETF's patent policy</a>,
but I said that the first issue can be fixed after adoption (before standardization),
and I now think that this is also true for the second issue.
The risks from patents are orthogonal to the risks from non-hybrids,
and I won't say more about patents in this blog post.</p>
<p><strong><a name="options">Why worry about a weaker standard if there's a stronger standard?</a></strong>
At this point you might be wondering:
if people are driving with seatbelts and this is on its way to being standardized,
what's the problem with <em>also</em> having a driving-without-seatbelts standard
for reckless fools who want to use that?</p>
<p>Think about Dual EC.
Dual EC wasn't the only randomness-generation standard.
But companies paid for FIPS certification of at least
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130224022123/http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/drbg/drbgval.html">62 different implementations</a>
of Dual EC.
NSA
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-rsa-idUSBRE9BJ1C220131220">bribed</a>
the RSA company to change its popular cryptographic library
to use Dual EC by default.</p>
<p>These companies saw that Dual EC was a standard from a reputable standards organization
(in fact, from three such organizations, namely ANSI, ISO, and NIST).
Even for companies realizing that Dual EC was a controversial standard pushed by NSA,
how many companies would risk losing money by refusing to implement Dual EC?
It's <em>easy</em> for purchasing managers to use standards to set purchasing requirements.</p>
<p>What's particularly pernicious about a driving-without-seatbelts standard
is that a purchasing manager who looks at it has an incentive to pick it
instead of the driving-with-seatbelts standard.
Wow, I can save $50 for every seatbelt that I skip!
Wow, I can save <a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#pppqefs">50 picodollars</a> for every ECC operation that I skip!
The purchasing manager doesn't care whether this cost reduction matters in context:
every penny saved sounds good, right?
The purchasing manager also doesn't realize the standard is <em>dangerous</em>:
on the contrary, why would it be a standard if it were unsafe?</p>
<p>Soon we're faced with widespread non-usage of seatbelts.
And then, years too late,
we realize that, oops, something people used and thought was secure actually wasn't,
just as in the case of SIKE.</p>
<p><strong><a name="callbad">Adoption of single encryption in TLS.</a></strong>
On 1 April 2025—unfortunately not as a joke—the TLS WG chairs
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/PpVAwrBTuRb5pR6D0C1ipdQuvYc/">issued</a>
a two-week "WG adoption call for the ML-KEM Post-Quantum Key Agreement for TLS 1.3 I-D",
the non-hybrid draft mentioned above.</p>
<p>Here are some quotes (some from me, some from other people)
illustrating objections raised on the TLS mailing list during the call period:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The draft creates security risks</strong>.
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/2Dfu4x678DEKCzF-fkdvJHJkS-8/">Sample quote</a>:
  "SIKE was applied to large volumes of user data as part of the CECPQ2
  experiment in 2019. SIKE was publicly broken in 2022.
  [paragraph break]
  The <em>only</em> reason that this didn't immediately give away the user data
  to attackers is that CECPQ2 was ECC+SIKE, rather than just SIKE.
  [paragraph break]
  Should we keep rolling out post-quantum cryptosystems to <em>try</em> to stop
  future quantum attacks? Yes, of course. But, just in case this goes
  horribly wrong <em>again</em>, let's make sure to keep ECC in place. Any draft
  violating this should be rejected as a security risk not just by WGs but
  also by the ISE."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The draft violates BCP 188.</strong>
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/xJqwB30b5wf3GVlAiIP3O4tuBIE/">Sample quote</a>:
  "To the extent that this is an allusion to
  NSA purchasing, it violates BCP 188 ('IETF Will Work to Mitigate
  Pervasive Monitoring')."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The draft violates the WG charter.</strong>
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/xJqwB30b5wf3GVlAiIP3O4tuBIE/">Sample quote</a>:
  "the draft's regression from ECC+PQ to just PQ
  is certainly a technology issue; and this is fatal, as a contravention
  of the 'improve security' goal in the WG charter".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>There are no principles supporting the adoption decision.</strong>
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/toxVUv_d1pdDspbfo8OxcJeC_QU/">Sample quote</a>:
  "I don't see what criteria we might use in adopting this that
  wouldn't leave the WG open to accusations of favouritism if
  we don't adopt other pure PQ national standards that will
  certainly arise".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The draft's motivation section is circular.</strong>
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/YNSu6ZO5e0JMJ1cRlnxh6oIjyZg/">Sample quote</a>:
  there is
  "a preliminary step that
  has been skipped here, namely identifying why the proposal is claimed to
  be adding something important. The draft's motivation sentence consists
  of rearranging buzzwords without answering the question:
  'Having a fully post-quantum (not hybrid) key agreement option for TLS
  1.3 is necessary for migrating beyond hybrids and for users that need
  to be fully post-quantum.'&nbsp;"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The draft increases software complexity.</strong>
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/uOmcMEqlyekrvcOgdsf7GtIlf3w/">Sample quote</a>:
  "The main stated benefit of using a standalone ML-KEM is complexity
  reduction, but with the current progress in the deployment of the ML-KEM +
  ECC hybrid method, a standalone ML-KEM method actually increases overall
  complexity in software stacks."
  (This was responding to a claim during the adoption-call period
  that the draft provided a "compute / dependency base that is minimalist".)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a high-level survey of the objections.
These quotes aren't intended to convey the full text of objections.
They also aren't intended to convey the number of people objecting;
I'll get back to that below.</p>
<p><strong><a name="standards">Standardization procedures.</a></strong>
How does a standards-development organization handle objections?
The law on this topic in the United States has been settled for decades.</p>
<p>The starting point is that
agreements in restraint of interstate commerce are
<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2024-title15/html/USCODE-2024-title15-chap1-sec1.htm">illegal</a>.
Courts interpret this to cover various types of agreements
that are illegal <em>per se</em>,
such as price fixing and group boycotts,
along with further agreements that unreasonably interfere with competition.</p>
<p>Here's an
<a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/456/556/">example</a>
from the 1980s.
Agents of a company that was leading its market, McDonnell and Miller,
took control of a subcommittee of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers,
a standards-development organization.
They generated a letter, under ASME's apparent authority,
declaring that a new competitor's product wasn't compliant.
They distributed that letter to buyers, of course damaging the new competitor's business.</p>
<p>The competitor, HydroLevel, sued the conspirators—including ASME,
which didn't even <em>know</em> the abuse was happening.
HydroLevel won. ASME was ultimately forced to pay millions of dollars.
The Supreme Court didn't mince words in describing the anti-competitive
power of standards-development organizations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ASME wields great power in the Nation's economy. Its codes and
standards influence the policies of numerous States and cities, and,
as has been said about "so-called voluntary standards" generally,
its interpretations of its guidelines "may result in economic
prosperity or economic failure, for a number of businesses of all
sizes throughout the country," as well as entire segments of an
industry. ... ASME can be said to be "in reality, an
extragovernmental agency which prescribes rules for the regulation
and restraint of interstate commerce." ... When it cloaks its
subcommittee officials with the authority of its reputation, ASME
permits those agents to affect the destinies of businesses, and thus
gives them the power to frustrate competition in the marketplace.</p>
<p>... Many of ASME's officials are associated with members of the
industries regulated by ASME's codes. Although undoubtedly most
serve ASME without concern for the interests of their corporate
employers, some may well view their positions with ASME, at least in
part, as an opportunity to benefit their employers. When the great
influence of ASME's reputation is placed at their disposal, the less
altruistic of ASME's agents have an opportunity to harm their
employers' competitors through manipulation of ASME's codes.</p>
<p>... Only ASME can take systematic steps to make improper conduct on
the part of all its agents unlikely, and the possibility of civil
liability will inevitably be a powerful incentive for ASME to take
those steps. Thus, a rule that imposes liability on the
standard-setting organization -- which is best situated to prevent
antitrust violations through the abuse of its reputation -- is most
faithful to the congressional intent that the private right of
action deter antitrust violations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another
<a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/486/492/">Supreme Court case</a>
rejected an argument of
antitrust immunity for another standards-development organization.
The organization made various decisions by majority vote,
and had allowed
steel manufacturers to pack a standards-development group,
filling the group with pro-steel agents to take over a vote.
The Supreme Court
again recognized the importance of procedural safeguards preventing abuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The antitrust validity of these efforts is not established, without
more, by petitioner's literal compliance with the rules of the
Association, for the hope of procompetitive benefits depends upon
the existence of safeguards sufficient to prevent the
standard-setting process from being biased by members with economic
interests in restraining competition. An association cannot validate
the anticompetitive activities of its members simply by adopting
rules that fail to provide such safeguards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court declined at that point to draw a dividing line saying
which safeguards were required.
In 2004, Congress passed a
<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2024-title15/html/USCODE-2024-title15-chap69-sec4302.htm">law</a>
pinning this down:
the new law said that "standards development activity" by a "standards development organization"
isn't illegal <em>per se</em>,
and gave
<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2024-title15/html/USCODE-2024-title15-chap69-sec4301.htm">definitions</a>
of the quoted phrases.</p>
<p>In particular, a "standards development organization" is required by law to
"incorporate the attributes of openness, balance of interests, due process, an appeals process, and consensus in a manner consistent
with the Office of Management and Budget Circular Number A-119, as revised February 10, 1998".</p>
<p>That
<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1998-02-19/html/98-4177.htm">OMB rule</a>,
in turn,
defines "consensus" as follows:
"general
agreement, but not necessarily unanimity, and includes a process for
attempting to resolve objections by interested parties, as long as all
comments have been fairly considered, each objector is advised of the
disposition of his or her objection(s) and the reasons why, and the
consensus body members are given an opportunity to change their votes
after reviewing the comments".</p>
<p>The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
inserted itself into a private court case in
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250207015058/https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/file/1178246/dl">2019</a>
to say that "the United States has a significant
interest in the correct interpretation of the exemption from <em>per se</em>
treatment for standards development organizations engaging in standard setting activities".</p>
<p>Deputy Assistant Attorney General Alexander Okuliar in the same division
presented a longer statement to ANSI in
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250617062615/https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/speech/file/1281926/dl">2020</a>
regarding antitrust and standards.
The statement mentioned ANSI's compliance with the same requirements and said
"From an antitrust perspective, these requirements are central".</p>
<p>Here's a random
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250915073928/https://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/2907043f18b6c837c1256f2b00710424/0b9474d4e73bb310c12585fa0058b1ce/$FILE/C00067%20evaluation%20observations-final.pdf">example</a>
of what an objection-response document looks like in ISO, IEC, etc.
Not the best user interface, but it gets the job done.</p>
<p><strong><a name="agreement">There was not general agreement to adopt the non-hybrid draft.</a></strong>
Now that we have the concept of consensus in mind,
let's go back to what happened in the IETF TLS WG
regarding the non-hybrid draft.</p>
<p>During the adoption-call period,
there were statements from 20 people unequivocally supporting adoption:
David Adrian from Google,
Joseph Birr-Pixton,
Uri Blumenthal from Department of Defense subsidiary Lincoln Labs,
"Flo D" from GCHQ,
Quynh Dang from NIST,
Viktor Dukhovni,
Scott Fluhrer from Cisco,
Rebecca Guthrie from NSA,
Russ Housley,
Alicja Kario from IBM subsidiary Red Hat,
Kris Kwiatkowski,
Andrei Popov from Microsoft,
Tirumal Reddy from Cisco,
Yaroslav Rosomakho,
Jan Schaumann,
Sophie Schmieg from Google,
Martin Thomson from Mozilla,
Filippo Valsorda formerly from Google,
Loganaden Velvindron,
and
Thom Wiggers.</p>
<p>There were also statements from 2 people <em>conditionally</em> supporting adoption:
John Mattsson from Ericsson
("I support adoption as long as reuse of ephemeral keys is normatively forbidden, i.e.  MUST NOT reuse")
and
Yaakov Stein
("I support adoption of pure PQC KEMs drafts with Intended status: Informational
(meaning that the IETF is not recommending using)").</p>
<p>However, there were statements from 7 people unequivocally opposing adoption:
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/YyemGJF-4-hRVwOcJ47Rw4Nu8Js/">Thomas Bellebaum</a>
  ("I agree with Stephen on this one and would not support adoption of non-hybrids"),
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/uOmcMEqlyekrvcOgdsf7GtIlf3w/">Andrey Jivsov</a>
  ("I am opposed to the adoption of ML-KEM at this time"),
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/toxVUv_d1pdDspbfo8OxcJeC_QU/">Stephen Farrell</a>
  ("I'm opposed to adoption, at this time"),
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/0f6XBGPElMLNoiS1Eh3u7EhzoGc/">Rich Salz</a>
  ("I was all set to say that I am in favor of adoption, but Stephen's post
  changed my mind. [paragraph break] The conservative and safe thing is to stick to hybrids and that is what the IETF should do for now"),
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/uhWI53zIjWJT5ZiS_UthyBe2k9Y/">Rob Sayre</a>
  ("I oppose adoption"),
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/EzKcwjagajQqcRpH4TDTn70W9hc/">Sun Shuzhou</a>
  ("I'm opposed to adoption"),
and me.</p>
<p>Even assuming that the 2 statements of conditional support are treated as positive votes,
the overall situation here, 22 positive votes and 7 negative votes,
does not qualify as general agreement.
"General"
<a href="https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/general">means</a>
"shared by or affecting most people, or most of the people in a group";
"most"
<a href="https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/most">means</a>
"nearly all of the people or things in a group, or nearly all of something";
the phrase "general agreement" means that nearly everyone agrees.
Merely having three quarters agree is not good enough.</p>
<p>What happens if a standards-development organization issues a rule
declaring that "general agreement" exists
even when a quarter of the votes are in opposition?
I haven't found any court cases on point,
but I would expect courts to reject this
as being inconsistent with the plain meaning of "general agreement".</p>
<p>Anyway, IETF hasn't attempted to issue such a rule.
On the contrary, IETF
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250603130154/https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/">claims</a>
that WG decisions are <em>not</em> taken by voting:
"Decisions within WGs, as with the broader IETF, are taken by 'rough consensus' and not by voting."
This begs the question of what IETF thinks "rough consensus" means.
Letting chairs make arbitrary decisions is a violation of due process.</p>
<p>More to the point, IETF can't override the definition of "consensus" in the law.
That definition requires general agreement.
Adoption of this draft was controversial, and didn't reach general agreement.</p>
<p><strong><a name="resolution">Objections were not handled properly.</a></strong>
Within the statements in favor of adoption,
most of the statements were very short:
e.g., just the words "I support adoption" with no further comments.</p>
<p>Some statements in favor of adoption did say more,
such as stating circular arguments for the draft
(e.g.: "as time progresses, non-hybrid key exchanges will
become more and more commonplace, so why not have it already defined?"),
or expressing concerns about key reuse
(e.g.: "I also share John's concerns about key reuse,
but would prefer to litigate that in the working group, rather than during adoption"),
without responding to the content of the objections.</p>
<p>There was a response to one word in the lack-of-principles objection.
(The response was as follows:
"The NIST competition was international, and Kyber was developed by an
international team. I struggle to understand how adopting this document
would somehow be 'favoritism'.")
A brief note by one supporter tangentially related to one objection
falls far short of fair consideration of each objection by the group as a whole.</p>
<p>I tried to engage that supporter in discussion.
I started by quoting the following earlier statement in the commentator's message:
"I find it to be cognitive dissonance to simultaneously argue that the
quantum threat requires immediate work, and yet we are also somehow
uncertain of if the algorithms are totally broken. Both cannot be true
at the same time."
I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/2Dfu4x678DEKCzF-fkdvJHJkS-8/">responded</a>
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rolling out PQ is trying to reduce the damage from an attacker having a
quantum computer within the security lifetime of the user data. Doing
that as ECC+PQ instead of just PQ is trying to reduce the damage in case
the PQ part is broken. These actions are compatible, so how exactly do
you believe they're contradictory?</p>
<p>Here's an analogous example of basic risk mitigation: there's endless
work that goes into having planes not crash, not hit turbulence, etc.,
but we still ask airplane passengers to keep their seatbelts on whenever
they're in their seats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was still no reply to this
by the time the adoption call closed two weeks later.</p>
<p>The broader pattern was that
objectors were engaging in discussion while supporters were not.
The majority process wasn't "attempting to resolve each objection";
it was simply collecting positive votes,
trying to <em>override</em> objections from the minority
without even <em>answering</em> those objections,
let alone trying to <em>resolve</em> them.</p>
<p>That's in an organization saying that decisions aren't taken by voting.
The same organization also
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250528213926/https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-llc-statement-competition-law-issues/">says</a>,
as part of explaining why it's supposedly complying with antitrust law:
"IETF activities are conducted with extreme transparency, in public forums. Decision-making requires achieving broad consensus via these public processes."</p>
<p>When there's an objection,
the legal concept of consensus
requires not just fairly considering the objection,
and not just attempting to resolve the objection,
but—if resolution fails—having the group agree on
the contents of a <em>response</em> to the objection.
That's an official statement of <em>why</em> the objection was overridden.
It's something that can be appealed if it's wrong.
Consider, for example,
ISO's
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250626064256/https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/consolidated/index.html#a_2_5_3">simple rule</a>
saying "Committees are required to respond to all comments received".
In IETF, there weren't even <em>informal</em> responses to the objections listed above,
let alone official responses.</p>
<p><strong><a name="chairs">The chairs declared consensus anyway.</a></strong>
Shortly before the end of the specified adoption-call period,
the chairs
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/_AWy51BSgX1ipv0hfnAzLrDrTYI/">declared</a>
"consensus to adopt this draft as a working group item".
There were some notes on followup procedures,
but there was no explanation of the rationale for this claim of consensus.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250424144801/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/iCPW1FHzdwoYuUztIVfZvDtJYII/">challenged</a>
the claim of consensus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Um, what? There were several people (including me) raising objections on
list to basic flaws in this draft, such as (1) the failure to provide an
ECC backup to limit the damage from further security problems in the PQ
layer, (2) the failure to provide an engineering justification for this
option, and (3) the lack of any principles that would justify saying no
to options selected by other governments if this option is allowed.</p>
<p>Your message doesn't explain how you came to the conclusion that there's
consensus. Surely you aren't relying on some tally of positive votes to
ram this document through while ignoring objections; voting isn't how
IETF is supposed to work. So how <em>did</em> you come to this conclusion?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few days later,
the chairs
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250522155251/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/k7_PEqKZulXMtm-D_9pEvfqcxAU/">responded</a>
that they had declared consensus
"because there is clearly sufficient interest to work on this draft".</p>
<p>I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250513013809/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/501mDxIkopb4xubDc8YQYyiZQDU/">said</a>
that this was ambiguous (sufficient for what?);
said that in any case this criterion was improper since it "would allow a draft to be adopted
over amply justified objections of almost all WG participants,
simply because the chairs and a few participants say they have enough interest in working on the draft";
and asked for an explicit statement
of whether this was the complete explanation
of why the chairs had declared consensus.</p>
<p>The chairs
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250617140508/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/25uD_umU7uOL9LQ1sirFxyA9xmA/">responded</a>
that "sufficient" means "that there were enough people willing to review the draft".
They added that "WGs groups have adopted drafts with much less support than this one received."
Gee, that's confidence-inspiring.</p>
<p>Meanwhile
an IETF "security area director"
had jumped into the discussion,
in particular
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250517194102/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/RK1HQB7Y-WFBxQaAveeT7pHZbbc/">writing</a>
"There is clearly consensus
based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ...
The vast majority was in favour of adoption ...
There were a few dissenting opinions".</p>
<p>Remember that the actual tallies were 20 supporters, 2 conditional supporters, and 7 opponents,
even if some people (for example, me) had sent multiple messages.
Nobody had posted the actual tallies at this point:
there was just this "security area director" claiming that the "vast majority" of the "67 responses" were in favor
while there were only "a few dissenting opinions".
Also remember that this is an organization that claims
that it doesn't make decisions by voting.</p>
<p>The "security area director"
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250517194102/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/RK1HQB7Y-WFBxQaAveeT7pHZbbc/">continued</a>
that "you cherry-picking when to call
consensus evaluation 'voting' depending on whether misnaming this
is in your advantage ... is dishonestly manipulative";
that I was violating the "code of conduct";
and that if I did not "voluntarily stop this kind of behaviour"
there would be "measures under the terms of RFC3934 which is part of BCP25".</p>
<p>In a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250513185456/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/nqouPVfPtU7hm-RF0lSDHCfze54/">followup message</a>,
the "security area director" wrote
"you calling into question this consensus
call of the WG chair is abusive and follows a repetitive pattern.
Nevertheless, for now this is your right ...
you are attempting to bait the chairs to
say they took inventory of the public emails ...
there comes a point where you will be prevented from further playing these games".</p>
<p>Wait a minute: "<em>for now</em> this is your right" (emphasis added)
and "you will be prevented from further playing these games"?
Sounds ominous.
What did the "security area director" mean by this?
No more objections in IETF?
No more appeals?
NSA's minions can just ram their non-consensual drafts through IETF
without opponents even being allowed to <em>speak up</em>?</p>
<p>Actually, yes, there's a stealth activity going on right now
that will have this effect unless enough people take action by Tuesday the 7th.
I hope to have another blog post up in a day or two saying what's going on here.</p>
<p>Anyway,
I've filed a formal
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20250812-non-hybrid.pdf">complaint</a>
regarding the claim of consensus to adopt.
So far the complaint hasn't been handled properly,
but hope springs eternal.
I don't have an answer yet to the subtitle question of this blog post.</p><hr><span size="1"><b>Version:</b>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> In this blog post, we walk through how to use Matrix Cores in HIP kernels, with a focus on low-precision data types such as FP16, FP8, and FP4, as well as the new family of Matrix Core instructions with exponent block scaling introduced in the AMD CDNA™4 architecture. Through code examples and illustrations, we provide the necessary knowledge to start programming Matrix Cores, covering modern low-precision floating-point types, the Matrix Core compiler intrinsics, and the data layouts required by the Matrix Core instructions. The blog post is also available on <a href="https://rocm.blogs.amd.com/software-tools-optimization/matrix-cores-cdna/README.html">ROCm Blogs</a>.</p>

<h2 id="1-matrix-cores">1. Matrix Cores</h2>

<p>Matrix multiplication is an essential part of AI and HPC workloads. The AMD CDNA™ architecture features special-purpose hardware, the Matrix Cores, to accelerate matrix fused-multiply-add (MFMA) operations defined as <code>D:=A*B+C</code>. Please note that MFMA instructions are often used to update a matrix in-place (=accumulation) so that <code>D=C</code> and <code>C:=A*B+C</code>. The matrices <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are called input matrices, while the matrix <code>D</code> is referred to as the output matrix or accumulator.</p>

<p>The performance gains from using Matrix Cores are especially significant in mixed-precision mode, where the input matrices use lower-precision data types instead of FP32. The output matrix, however, is stored in FP32 to minimize accuracy loss during accumulation. The tables below show the theoretical peak performance of Matrix Cores with different input data types on both AMD CDNA™3 and AMD CDNA™4 architectures. On the AMD Instinct™ MI325X, using FP16 input matrices delivers nearly an 8x performance increase compared to single-precision, with only minimal accuracy loss. Switching to FP8 further doubles the performance providing a 16x increase when compared to FP32. The AMD CDNA™4 architecture further improves Matrix Core performance, delivering up to 2x higher throughput for FP16 and FP8 compared to the AMD CDNA™3 architecture. In addition, AMD CDNA™4 introduces new low-precision data types such as FP6 and FP4, enabling up to 64x performance gain relative to FP32. Please refer to the <a href="https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/instinct-tech-docs/white-papers/amd-cdna-3-white-paper.pdf">AMD CDNA™3</a> and <a href="https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/instinct-tech-docs/white-papers/amd-cdna-4-architecture-whitepaper.pdf">AMD CDNA™4</a> white papers for detailed architecture specifications.</p>

<h2 id="2-low-precision-floating-point-types">2. Low-Precision Floating-Point Types</h2>

<p>A binary representation of a floating-point number consists of <code>n</code> bits, where <code>m</code> of <code>n</code> bits represent the mantissa, 1 bit determines the sign and <code>n-m-1</code> bits represent the exponent. The following image illustrates the binary format of a floating-point number and how the exponent and mantissa are calculated based on its binary representation.</p>

<p><img src="https://salykova.github.io/assets/matrix_cores/binary_format_2.png" alt="binary_repr" width="80%"></p>
<p>
<em>Figure 1: Binary representation of a floating-point number.</em>
</p>

<p>Floating-point types are characterized by the number of bits used for the exponent and for the mantissa. Increasing the exponent width extends the range of representable values, while increasing the mantissa width improves precision. Since all floating-point types include the sign bit, a shorthand notation typically specifies only the exponent and mantissa widths. For example, the E4M3 type is an 8-bit floating-point type with 4-bit exponent and 3-bit mantissa. Additionally, a floating-point type is specified by exponent bias - a number that is subtracted from the exponent during conversion from binary format to real value. Given the exponent width, mantissa width, and exponent bias, one can convert the binary representation of a floating-point type (except E8M0) into its real value using the following equation:</p>

<p><img src="https://salykova.github.io/assets/matrix_cores/g81.png" alt="fp_cvt" width="70%"></p>
<p>
<em>Figure 2: Conversion to real value from binary representation for floating-point numbers.</em>
</p>

<p>Please note that the equation takes different forms depending on whether the exponent is zero or not. Often, certain exponent and mantissa values are reserved for special values (e.g. <code>NaN</code>, <code>Infinity</code>), which limits the range of representable real numbers. For example, the FP16 type has 5-bit exponent with a nominal range of <code>[0, 1, ... 2^5-1] = [0, 1, ... 31]</code>. However, the exponent value <code>E = 31</code> is reserved for <code>NaN</code> (if the mantissa <code>M != 0</code>) and <code>infinity</code> (if the mantissa <code>M = 0</code>). Therefore, the largest exponent value that can represent a real number is <code>E = 30</code>.</p>

<p>Please note that the E4M3 type has two variants: E4M3FN and E4M3FNUZ. Both E4M3FN and E4M3FNUZ use 4 bits for the exponent and 3 bits for the mantissa. They use different exponent biases and differ in the special values they can represent. Neither variant supports infinities, which is why their notations include FN (FiNite). However, E4M3FN supports <code>+0</code>, <code>-0</code>, <code>+NaN</code> and <code>-Nan</code>, while E4M3FNUZ supports only <code>+0</code> and <code>NaN</code>, hence <code>UZ</code> (Unsigned Zero). The image below demonstrates how to convert a binary sequence into a real value, using E4M3FNUZ type as an example:</p>

<p><img src="https://salykova.github.io/assets/matrix_cores/e4m3fnuz.png" alt="fp_cvt" width="90%"></p>
<p>
<em>Figure 3: E4M3FNUZ encoding details.</em>
</p>

<p>FP8 types are divided into E4M3 and E5M2 formats. The E5M2 format is sometimes referred to as BF8, similar to BF16, where exponent width is larger compared to FP16. Similar to E4M3, E5M2 is further subdivided into two variants: E5M2 (OCP) and E5M2FNUZ. The AMD CDNA™3 architecture uses FNUZ variants for both E4M3 and E5M2, whereas the CDNA™4 architecture uses E4M3FN and E5M2 (OCP) variants. E4M3FN and E5M2 are standardized formats defined by the Open Compute Project (OCP). For detailed specifications, see the <a href="https://www.opencompute.org/documents/ocp-microscaling-formats-mx-v1-0-spec-final-pdf">OCP Microscaling Formats (MX) Specification</a> and the <a href="https://onnx.ai/onnx/technical/float8.html">ONNX documentation</a>. For visualization of FP8 values and their binary representations please refer to the <a href="https://asawicki.info/articles/fp8_tables.php">FP8 Data table</a>. Additionally, see the chapter <a href="https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/reference/low_fp_types.html">“Low-precision floating-point types”</a> in the AMD ROCm™ documentation for details on using low-precision types in HIP.</p>

<p>There is a special 8-bit format, E8M0, which is not used as a standard element data type but instead serves as a scale factor for microscaling types and block-scaled MFMA operations (discussed later in this article). Its value is calculated according to the equation below:</p>

<p><img src="https://salykova.github.io/assets/matrix_cores/e8m0.png" alt="fp_cvt" width="55%"></p>
<p>
<em>Figure 4: E8M0 encoding details.</em>
</p>

<p>The exponent value <code>E = 255</code> is reserved for <code>NaN</code> values, limiting the range of representable real numbers to <code>[2^-127 ... 2^127]</code>.</p>

<p>Similar to FP8, FP6 has two formats: E2M3 and E3M2. The latter, E3M2, is often referred to as BF6 due to its larger exponent width compared to E2M3.</p>

<h2 id="3-matrix-fused-multiply-add-mfma-instructions">3. Matrix fused-multiply-add (MFMA) Instructions</h2>

<p>The AMD CDNA™3 and CDNA™4 architectures support a variety of MFMA operations, which are characterized by the matrix dimensions <code>M</code>, <code>N</code>, <code>K</code> and the data type of input/output matrices. The following table lists all available floating-point MFMA instructions for the AMD CDNA™3 and CDNA™4 architectures. As can be seen from the table, the AMD CDNA™4 architecture extends the set of available MFMA instructions by adding new FP16/BF16 instructions with larger matrix dimensions. Furthermore, it introduces FP6/FP4 data types and provides a completely new set of FP8/FP6/FP4 instructions where the types can be independently used for the matrices <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. Finally, the AMD CDNA™4 architecture enables MFMA with block exponent scaling.</p>

<p>Please note that the table lists only floating-point type MFMA instructions with batch size = 1. In addition to them, the AMD CDNA™3 and CDNA™4 architectures support batched MFMA operations, where multiple output matrices are computed in parallel. These instructions are not covered in this article. See the Chapter 7 “Matrix Arithmetic Instructions” in the <a href="https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/instinct-tech-docs/instruction-set-architectures/amd-instinct-mi300-cdna3-instruction-set-architecture.pdf">AMD CDNA™3</a> and <a href="https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/instinct-tech-docs/instruction-set-architectures/amd-instinct-cdna4-instruction-set-architecture.pdf">AMD CDNA™4</a> ISA reference guides for the full list of available MFMA instructions.</p>

<p>The table above specifies cycle count for each MFMA operation. Given a known cycle count, one can estimate theoretical peak performance in TFLOP/s of corresponding MFMA operation using the formula below:</p>

<p><code>
2*M*N*K * num_matrix_cores * (max_engine_clock / cycle_count) / 10^6,
</code></p>

<p>where</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>num_matrix_cores</code> is total number of matrix cores in a GPU (specified in white paper)</li>
  <li><code>max_engine_clock</code> is max engine clock (peak) in MHz (specified in white paper)</li>
  <li><code>cycle_count</code> is cycle count of corresponding MFMA instruction</li>
  <li><code>M, N, K</code> are matrix dimensions</li>
</ol>

<p>Using this formula and the MFMA instruction <code>32x32x8 FP16</code> as an example, we can estimate theoretical peak FP16 Matrix Core performance on the AMD Instinct™ MI325X:</p>

<p><code>2*32*32*8 * 1216 * (2100 / 32) / 10^6 = 1307.4 TFLOP/s</code>.</p>

<h2 id="4-compiler-intrinsics">4. Compiler Intrinsics</h2>

<p>To use Matrix Core instructions in HIP kernels, LLVM provides built-in compiler intrinsic functions. The list of all available compiler intrinsics can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/include/clang/Basic/BuiltinsAMDGPU.def">LLVM Github repository</a>. The syntax of the MFMA intrinsics has the following format:</p>

<p><code>d_reg = __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_ODType_MxNxKInDType(a_reg, b_reg, c_reg, cbsz, abid, blgp)</code>,</p>

<p>where</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>MxNxK</code> specifies the shapes of the matrices <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>,</li>
  <li><code>ODType</code> is data type of the matrices <code>C</code> and <code>D</code>,</li>
  <li><code>InDType</code> is data type of the input matrices <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>,</li>
  <li><code>a_reg</code> is a scalar/vector containing a portion of the matrix <code>A</code>,</li>
  <li><code>b_reg</code> is a scalar/vector containing a portion of the matrix <code>B</code>,</li>
  <li><code>c_reg</code> is a vector containing a portion of the matrix <code>C</code>,</li>
  <li><code>d_reg</code> is a vector containing a portion of the matrix <code>D</code>,</li>
  <li><code>cbsz</code>, <code>abid</code>, <code>blgp</code> are broadcast flags. For the following discussion, these flags are irrelevant and are, therefore, set to 0 by default, unless specified otherwise. Please refer to the ISA reference guide for detailed information on the broadcast flags.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example,</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>__builtin_amdgcn_mfma_f32_16x16x16f16</code> performs <code>16x16x16</code> MFMA, where both input matrices <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> have type <code>FP16</code> and the output matrix has type <code>FP32</code></li>
  <li><code>__builtin_amdgcn_mfma_f32_32x32x16_fp8_fp8</code> performs <code>32x32x16</code> MFMA, where both input matrices <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> have type <code>FP8(E4M3)</code> and the output matrix is stored in <code>FP32</code></li>
  <li><code>__builtin_amdgcn_mfma_f32_32x32x16_fp8_bf8</code> performs <code>32x32x16</code> MFMA, where the matrix <code>A</code> has type <code>FP8(E4M3)</code> and the matrix <code>B</code> has type <code>BF8(E5M2)</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The MFMA instructions are wavefront-level (warp-level) instructions, where all work-items (threads) within a wavefront collectively perform a single MFMA operation and the operands <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code> are distributed across work-items so that each work-item in the wavefront holds a portion of the operands. In order to use the MFMA instructions, it’s required to understand how the operands are distributed across threads within a wavefront. The ISA reference guide fully specifies the data layout for all available MFMA instructions. For illustrative purposes, the next chapter explains a subset of the MFMA instructions and the corresponding data layouts.</p>

<h2 id="5-examples">5. Examples</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Important note:</strong> In the following discussion we assume the matrices are stored in row-major order. The wavefront size on the AMD CDNA™ architecture is 64. The shapes of the matrices <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code> are <code>MxK</code>, <code>KxN</code>, <code>MxN</code>, and <code>MxN</code>, respectively. The first dimension denotes the number of rows and the second dimension the number of columns in a matrix. For example, the matrix <code>A</code> has <code>M</code> rows and <code>K</code> columns.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="51-__builtin_amdgcn_mfma_f32_32x32x2f32">5.1. __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_f32_32x32x2f32</h3>

<p>In this example we will multiply matrix <code>A</code> of size <code>32x2</code> with matrix <code>B</code> of size <code>2x32</code> using single wavefront (64 threads) and single MFMA instruction. The output matrix <code>C</code> has shape <code>32x32</code>. The input and output matrices are FP32. Since threads within a wavefront collectively perform single MFMA instruction, the operands are distributed across the threads. Each thread stores</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>M * K / wavefront_size = 32 * 2 / 64 = 1</code> entries of the matrix <code>A</code></li>
  <li><code>K * N / wavefront_size = 2 * 32 / 64 = 1</code> entries of the matrix <code>B</code></li>
  <li><code>M * N / wavefront_size = 32 * 32 / 64 = 16</code> entries of the matrix <code>C</code></li>
</ol>

<p>The operands are distributed according to the scheme below. The matrix elements highlighted in light red are those stored by the thread with index <code>0</code> within the wavefront.</p>

<p>To define FP8, we use <code>__hip_fp8_storage_t</code> type from <code>hip_fp8.h</code>. Note that the intrinsic function expects its first two operands to be of type <code>long</code>. To compile the code, the operands <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are, therefore, converted to <code>long</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Important note:</strong> the MFMA instruction discussed in this example is supported only on AMD CDNA™4 GPUs (gfx950). Please make sure to install AMD ROCm™ version 7.0 or later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The AMD CDNA™4 architecture introduces a new family of MFMA instructions with block exponent scaling. The syntax of these instructions differs from the classic MFMA compiler intrinsics:</p>

<p><code>d_reg = __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_scale_f32_MxNxK_f8f6f4(a_reg, b_reg, c_reg, Atype, Btype, OPSEL_A, scale_a, OPSEL_B, scale_b)</code></p>

<ol>
  <li><code>MxNxK</code> specifies shapes of the matrices <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code></li>
  <li><code>a_reg</code> is a vector containing elements of the matrix <code>A</code>,</li>
  <li><code>b_reg</code> is a vector containing elements of the matrix <code>B</code>,</li>
  <li><code>c_reg</code> is a vector containing elements of the matrix <code>C</code>,</li>
  <li><code>d_reg</code> is a vector containing elements of the matrix <code>D</code>,</li>
  <li><code>Atype</code> is an integer that specifies the data type of the matrix <code>A</code>. The following values are possible: <code>0 = E4M3 (fp8), 1 = E5M2(bf8), 2 = E2M3(fp6), 3 = E3M2(bf6), 4 = E2M1(fp4)</code>,</li>
  <li><code>Btype</code> is an integer that specifies the data type of the matrix <code>B</code>. The following values are possible: <code>0 = E4M3 (fp8), 1 = E5M2(bf8), 2 = E2M3(fp6), 3 = E3M2(bf6), 4 = E2M1(fp4)</code>,</li>
  <li><code>OPSEL_A</code>, <code>OPSEL_B</code> are OPSEL codes. These arguments are not relevant for the discussion and therefore will be set to <code>0</code>,</li>
  <li><code>scale_a</code>, <code>scale_b</code> are scalars / vectors containing scale factors of type <code>E8M0</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>As an example, let’s take a closer look at the instruction <code>__builtin_amdgcn_mfma_scale_f32_32x32x64_f8f6f4</code>. The inputs to this instruction are</p>

<ol>
  <li>Matrix <code>A</code> of size <code>32x64</code></li>
  <li>Matrix <code>Ax</code> of size <code>32x2</code></li>
  <li>Matrix <code>B</code> of size <code>64x32</code></li>
  <li>Matrix <code>Bx</code> of size <code>2x32</code></li>
</ol>

<p>The output matrix <code>C</code> has shape <code>32x32</code>. Specifically, this instruction performs the following operation using single wavefront (64 threads):</p>

<p>
<em>Figure 8: Block-scaled matrix multiplication via __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_scale_f32_32x32x64_f8f6f4.</em>
</p>

<p>During dot product operations, the scales <code>Ax</code>, <code>Bx</code> are applied after the normal dot product and prior to output/accumulation.</p>

<p>In this example, we will multiply two FP8 matrices using the <code>__builtin_amdgcn_mfma_scale_f32_32x32x64_f8f6f4</code> intrinsic function. The input matrices <code>A</code>, <code>B</code> are stored in FP8 format, while the output matrix is stored in FP32. The scale matrices <code>Ax</code>, <code>Bx</code> contain elements of type <code>E8M0</code>. Each thread stores <code>32</code> entries from the matrix <code>A</code>, <code>1</code> entry from the matrix <code>Ax</code>, <code>32</code> entries from the matrix <code>B</code>, <code>1</code> entry from the matrix <code>Bx</code> and <code>16</code> entries from the matrix <code>C</code>. The operands are distributed according to the scheme below. Please note that this scheme is valid only if both input matrices <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> have FP8 type. For illustrative purposes, the matrix elements stored by the thread with <code>threadIdx.x = 0</code> are highlighted in light red, while the elements stored by the thread with <code>threadIdx.x = 32</code> within the wavefront are highlighted in light green.</p>

<p>Please note that in this example we use <code>__amd_fp8_storage_t</code> type defined in <code>hip_ext_ocp.h</code> to represent FP8. This library provides extensions APIs for low-precision and micro-scaling formats, and compared to <code>hip_fp8.h</code>, exposes a wider capability set. <code>gfx950</code> provides hardware acceleration for these APIs. Most of the APIs are 1 to 1 mapping of hardware instruction. Additionally, we use <code>uint8_t</code> type to represent <code>E8M0</code> scale factors. Since <code>scale_a</code> and <code>scale_b</code> encode exponent values, the corresponding actual scale factors are <code>2^(scale_a - 127)</code> and <code>2^(scale_b - 127)</code>. If <code>scale_a = scale_b = 127</code>, the actual scale factors are equal to <code>1</code> and no scaling is applied.</p>

<p>In our last example, we demonstrate how to multiply two FP4 matrices using the <code>__builtin_amdgcn_mfma_scale_f32_32x32x64_f8f6f4</code> intrinsic function. As in the previous example, each thread stores <code>32</code> entries from the matrix <code>A</code>, <code>1</code> entry from the matrix <code>Ax</code>, <code>32</code> entries from the matrix <code>B</code>, <code>1</code> entry from the matrix <code>Bx</code> and <code>16</code> entries from the matrix <code>C</code>. The data layout for the output matrix remains the same as in the FP8 case. However, the data layout for the input matrices is different and depicted below. For illustrative purposes, the matrix elements stored by the thread with <code>threadIdx.x = 0</code> are highlighted in light red, while the elements stored by the thread with <code>threadIdx.x = 32</code> within the wavefront are highlighted in light green.</p>

<p>Since memory addressing is not allowed at a granularity smaller than 8 bits, we use <code>__amd_fp4x2_storage_t</code> (an alias for <code>uint8_t</code>) to store the input matrices and enable pointer operations. Note that the FP4 elements that need to be loaded from the matrix <code>B</code> are not contiguous in memory. To extract a single FP4 element, we use the <code>__amd_extract_fp4</code> function provided in <code>hip_ext_ocp.h</code>. This function returns one FP4 element (of type <code>uint8_t</code>) from a fp4x2 vector, based on the index passed as the second argument:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>uint8_t</span> <span>__amd_extract_fp4</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>__amd_fp4x2_storage_t</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>size_t</span> <span>index</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>index</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0xFu</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>4</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Two FP4 values are then combined into <code>__amd_fp4x2_storage_t</code> using <code>__amd_create_fp4x2</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>__amd_fp4x2_storage_t</span> <span>__amd_create_fp4x2</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>uint8_t</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>uint8_t</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>__amd_fp4x2_storage_t</span> <span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>y</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>4</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>ret</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The compiler intrinsic function <code>__builtin_amdgcn_mfma_scale_f32_32x32x64_f8f6f4</code> requires its first two arguments to be 256 bits wide. Since 32 FP4 elements occupy only 128 bits, we define <code>fp4x64_t</code>, which is 256 bits wide. In this type, 128 bits contain data, while the remaining 128 bits are zero. This allows us to pass <code>a_reg</code> and <code>b_reg</code> to the intrinsic function and compile the code successfully.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>In this article, we introduced Matrix Core instructions available on the AMD CDNA™3 and CDNA™4 architectures. We covered floating-point formats in detail, including modern low-precision element data types such as FP8, FP6, FP4, and the scale data type E8M0. We further explained how the floating-point types are represented as binary sequences and demonstrated, with concrete examples, how to convert their binary representations into real values. Next, we listed Matrix Core instructions supported by the modern CDNA™ architectures and discussed how to calculate the theoretical peak performance of Matrix Cores for specific MFMA instructions. To make the discussion more practical, we reviewed the compiler intrinsic functions that allow users to program Matrix Cores inside HIP kernels. Finally, we examined a subset of MFMA instructions in detail, providing code examples and illustrations to explain data layout and demonstrate how to implement simple mixed-precision MFMA operations in HIP. For additional information on Matrix Cores and low-precision data types, please refer to the following resources:</p>

<p>What’s the catch? Seems to good to be true? Well, this thing sits between your devices and the wall. So you need to neatly run extension cables from every room in the house to the “sun box”, and then run one cable from the box to the panels, and another to the wall (optional, just so it can fall back to pulling power from the wall). Photos of this are coming soon.</p>

<p>Will it ever push power back into the wall? Nope! It’ll only ever draw from the wall in the event that both the sun is down and the battery is dead (so your fridge won’t go off overnight for example).</p>

<p>Is this legal? Yes, see above. No difference to plugging your fridge into your wall, as far as the utility is concerned.</p>

The only change </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/uks-demands-apple-break-encryption-emergency-us-all"><span>since the last time</span></a><span> they demanded this is that the order is allegedly limited to only apply to British users. That doesn’t make it any better.</span></p>
<p><span>The demand uses a power called a “Technical Capability Notice” (TCN) in the U.K.’s Investigatory Powers Act. </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/investigatory-powers-bill-and-apple"><span>At the time of its signing</span></a><span> we noted this law would likely be used to demand Apple spy on its users. <br></span></p>
<p><span>After the U.K. government first issued the TCN in January, </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/cornered-uks-demand-encryption-backdoor-apple-turns-its-strongest-security-setting"><span>Apple was forced</span></a><span> to either create a backdoor or block its </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-encrypt-your-iphone"><span>Advanced Data Protection</span></a><span> feature—which turns on end-to-end encryption for iCloud—for all U.K. users. The company decided to remove the feature in the U.K. instead of creating the backdoor.</span></p>
<p><span>The initial order from January targeted the data of </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> Apple users. In August, the </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-spy-chief-gabbard-says-uk-agreed-drop-backdoor-mandate-apple-2025-08-19/"><span>US claimed the U.K. withdrew the demand</span></a><span>, but Apple did not re-enable Advanced Data Protection. The new order provides insight into why: the U.K. was just rewriting it to only apply to British users. <br></span></p>
<p><span>This is still an unsettling overreach that makes U.K. users less safe and less free. As we’ve said</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/clipper-chips-birthday-looking-back-22-years-key-escrow-failures"> <span>time</span></a><span> and</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption"> <span>time again</span></a><span>,</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/10/salt-typhoon-hack-shows-theres-no-security-backdoor-thats-only-good-guys"> <span>any backdoor built for the government</span></a><span> puts everyone at greater risk of hacking, identity theft, and fraud. It sets a dangerous precedent to demand similar data from other companies, and provides a runway for other authoritarian governments to issue comparable orders. The news of continued server-side access to users' data comes just days after the UK government announced an </span><a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/press-releases/id-cards-uk-risks-sleeping-walking-into-pre-crime-state/"><span>intrusive mandatory digital ID scheme</span></a><span>, framed as a measure against illegal migration.</span></p>
<p><span>A tribunal hearing was initially set to </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c740r0m4mzjo"><span>take place in January 2026</span></a><span>, though it’s currently unclear if that will proceed or if the new order changes the legal process. Apple must continue to refuse these types of backdoors. Breaking end-to-end encryption for one country breaks it for everyone. These repeated attempts to weaken encryption violates</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/european-court-human-rights-confirms-undermining-encryption-violates-fundamental"> <span>fundamental human rights</span></a><span> and destroys our right to private spaces.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content-blocks"><p><span>The numbers are in: </span><span><strong>no one is paying for Microsoft 365 Copilot</strong></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>No, not the official numbers designed by Microsoft to </span><span><a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/numbers-designed-to-please" target="_blank" rel="">support their narrative</a></span><span>. I’m talking about something that MS would prefer not to address as these numbers tell a whole different story. As a result, they are from a source that we cannot verify and therefore something that every reader needs to evaluate the trustworthiness of.</span></p><div translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><p>❝</p><p><span><em>“A source that has seen materials related to sales has confirmed that, as of August 2025, Microsoft has around </em></span><span><em><strong>eight million active licensed users of Microsoft 365 Copilot</strong></em></span><span><em>, amounting to a 1.81% conversion rate across the 440 million Microsoft 365 subscribers.”</em></span></p></div><p><span>I know, Ed Zitron is hardly a neutral observer of the tech industry. He is doing something that almost no one else out there bothers to do, though. Which is checking whether the numbers released by tech vendors (especially OpenAI) make any sense. This is the foundation upon which his case against the financial validity of GenAI is built on, and being a regular reader of his premium newsletter issues, I find it fairly convincing.</span></p><p><span>So, when someone on the inside wants to find a channel to bring out the inconvenient truth about AI adoption, Ed is where they would likely reach out to. These numbers that have been disclosed about Microsoft’s commercial success (failure) of selling Copilot licenses are in line with those reported about the adoption rate of other paid AI plans from other vendors.</span></p><p><span>The story can be summarized as follows:</span></p><p><span>M365 Copilot became available for enterprise customers to purchase on November 1st, 2023. That was almost 2 years ago. Now, if we assume that the adoption rate is constant, the conversion rate mentioned by Ed could grow to around 2% by the time we reach November 2025.</span></p><p><span><strong>The 2% adoption rate in 2 years is diabolically bad.</strong></span><span> This is not just any lil’ Power Apps product that was promoted as a new tool for citizen developers to improve personal productivity. It has been the centerpiece of everything Microsoft has done and talked about for over 2 years now. I have never seen a bigger push for any MS product.</span></p><p><span>After all this — what do we even have here? 8 million active licensed users. For some tech products that might be a sizeable user base. But let’s be real here: Microsoft has at least 400,000 channel partners. If each partner org would have bought on average 20 seats of Microsoft 365 Copilot for their employees, that would already make up the 8M figure.</span></p><p><span>Indeed, most partners have to pay for the M365 Copilot seats. There are hardly any freebies available in the partner benefits packages. I pay €800 a year for MS licenses in </span><span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/membership/partner-success-core-benefits" target="_blank" rel="">Partner Success Core</a></span><span> and that doesn’t give me a single M365 Copilot seat. I have to pay the full price of €337 per year to get a chance to use the premium Copilot experience in my tenant for my solopreneur </span><span><a href="https://niiranenadvisory.com/" target="_blank" rel="">Power Platform advisory business</a></span><span>.</span></p><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://niiranenadvisory.com/"><img src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,quality=80,format=auto,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/1048e07d-ae52-43b3-b9f0-f0a89a45f137/Need_more_than_Perspectives.png" alt=""></a></p></div><p><span>This, of course, makes it easier to evaluate whether I get value from the license or not. While I acknowledge that I’m not the typical user persona for M365 Copilot, it has given me just a fraction of the value that my ChatGPT Plus subscription does. At a lower price point. Since I don’t have to sell and promote this product to customers, like many MS partners do, I’m free to tell everyone about this experience. As I’ve done in this newsletter for the past year on many, many occasions.</span></p><p><span>It could have been just me who’s a cranky old CRM consultant shouting at the AI cloud. Well, based on these adoption numbers for Microsoft 365 Copilot, I’m not in the minority. </span><span><strong>The vast majority of people out there who use Microsoft cloud tools don’t see Copilot as giving them enough value to justify the $30 per month cost.</strong></span></p><p><span>Remember: even though these aren’t individual users buying things for themselves, we’re not talking about just another MS license. This is AI! It’s the thing that’s </span><span><em>“no longer optional”</em></span><span> at so many companies — thanks to all the AI CEOs forcing their employees to adopt it or else. We read about these initiatives from media of how business leaders want to transform their company via AI on a daily basis.</span></p><p><span>There must be loads of companies who have gone and ticked the AI box by choosing to purchase M365 Copilot licenses. And despite all this blind support from management, this is as far as Microsoft has gotten with the paid Copilot product sales.</span></p><p id="agents-arent-doing-any-better"><h2 translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><span>Agents aren’t doing any better</span></h2></p><p><span>Another interesting figure from Ed’s newsletter was about SharePoint agents:</span></p><div translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><p>❝</p><p><span><span><em>“I’m also hearing that less than SharePoint — another popular enterprise app from Microsoft with 250 million users — had less than 300,000 weekly active users of its AI copilot features in August.”</em></span></span></p></div><p><span>Hmm, let’s see now. What other numbers do we have of agents that we could compare this with? Oh, right! The 3 million agents in FY25 story. Let’s revisit a screenshot I shared in my </span><span><a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/numbers-designed-to-please" target="_blank" rel="">Numbers designed to please</a></span><span> article a couple of months ago:</span></p><div><p><img src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,quality=80,format=auto,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/d3ff173e-686b-4c23-bd8b-d57c9561ef38/3_million_agents_Jeff_Teper.png" alt=""></p></div><p><span>My theory (as well as Suhail’s) was that most of the 3M agents would be in SharePoint, and they wouldn’t be in production use. Weekly usage could well be considered a threshold for an AI agent being in production, so that would give us 10% when comparing it to the 300k figure in Ed’s newsletter.</span></p><p><span>But that was about </span><span><strong>users</strong></span><span>. Unlike Copilot, which is supposed to be a personal AI assistant, agents are meant to be tools that many individuals tap into with their Copilot. Now, let’s ignore for a moment the crazy fact that you can’t use SharePoint agents in the Microsoft 365 Copilot UI. Out of the 300 million users of SharePoint Online (I don’t know why Ed said only 250M), 0.1% of them interacted with an agent during a week in August 2025. </span><span><strong>One user out of a thousand</strong></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Can you feel the AI transformation already?</span></p><p id="where-does-microsoft-go-from-here"><h2 translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><span>Where does Microsoft go from here?</span></h2></p><p><span>If this were a normal software product, the industry would have moved on already and invented something else to pitch to customers. In practice, it is anything but normal. GenAI is the only story left for Big Tech to tell when chasing for ever greater growth percentages. And yet the only thing growing are the capex investments.</span></p><p><span>Getting people to use AI services that they either want to (ChatGPT, all the AI coding assistants) or can’t avoid (Google search AI overviews, free Copilot features in MS products) is one thing. Making them voluntarily open their wallets and insert a credit card to purchase some of the AI magic dust is a whole different game. That’s the game where everyone has been losing so far, as no one besides NVidia or the IT consulting companies is making profits from GenAI at this point.</span></p><p><span>It’s not like all those GPUs could be left underutilized, though. The growth of especially the US economy relies on AI related activities. If they were to be removed, the </span><span><a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/what-bubble-oh-that-bubble" target="_blank" rel="">bubble would burst</a></span><span>. So, rolling back AI features is not an option, understandably. The only possibility is to reimagine the monetization model and hope that it works this time. And that’s exactly what Microsoft is actively pursuing.</span></p><p><span>First of all, the idea of bundling more of Copilot into the licenses customers already have is the obvious way to boost AI adoption. Which may not bring in any new money, yet will be a critical number for MS to show to investors. Who could soon begin questioning why the capex spend is necessary if the </span><span><a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-case-against-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="">GPU utilization for Microsoft 365’s enterprise Copilot is barely scratching 60%</a></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Enter Copilot Chat in </span><span><s>Office</s></span><span> Microsoft 365 apps. </span><span><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/copilot-chat-comes-to-the-microsoft-365-apps/4453349" target="_blank" rel="">Announced on September 15</a></span><span>, </span><span><em>“Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat and agents are rolling out in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote for all users—creating a unified chat experience across the apps millions of people use every day at work.”</em></span><span> What was once the main demo scenario of why contextual AI inside the business productivity apps is crucial for worker productivity is now something all 440 million M365 users get for no extra cost.</span></p><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/copilot-chat-comes-to-the-microsoft-365-apps/4453349"><img src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,quality=80,format=auto,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/684046c9-fc2e-400f-8199-71f2bb2cc742/Copilot_Chat_in_Microsoft_365_apps.png" alt=""></a></p><p><small><p><span>Copilot Chat pane in Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel, Word. For everyone.</span></p></small></p></div><p><span>The nice side effect from this replacement of app specific Copilots with the generic Chat has been that premium M365 Copilot users seem to have lost all of the smarts that their apps used to have.

I of course raised my concerns about the same useless AI assistants issue </span><span><a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/assistants-without-hands" target="_blank" rel="">a couple of months ago already</a></span><span>. I’m glad it’s not just me who is too dumb to get Copilot in Outlook to work with email and calendar.</span></p><p><span>Then, there’s the next push: </span><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/09/29/vibe-working-introducing-agent-mode-and-office-agent-in-microsoft-365-copilot/" target="_blank" rel="">vibe working</a></span><span>. What has been disguised as a marketing campaign to ride on the popularity of the vibe coding concept is actually an indirect admittance of the fact that GPT based M365 Copilot has been a disappointment for everyone. That’s why Microsoft is now teaming up with OpenAI’s biggest competitor Anthropic and building its new Office Agent features on top of Claude:</span></p><div translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><p>❝</p><p><span><em>“Today we’re introducing Office Agent, a multi-agent system that builds upon an open-source stack, </em></span><span><em><strong>Anthropic's Claude model</strong></em></span><span><em>, and a new taste-driven development (TDD) paradigm to deliver polished PowerPoint presentations, ready-to-use Word documents, and soon Excel spreadsheets.”</em></span></p></div><p><span>All of that is preview stuff, of course. When MS announced they were </span><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/09/24/expanding-model-choice-in-microsoft-365-copilot/" target="_blank" rel="">expanding model choice in M365 Copilot and Copilot Studio</a></span><span>, all the Modern Work consultants on LinkedIn were quick to point out that enabling Claude breaks the MS trust barrier for customer data. Well, tech industry reporters have been talking about how Charles Lamanna &amp; crew are embracing Claude for a while now, so I see it as only a matter of time before models like the new </span><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/copilot-studio/available-today-claude-sonnet-4-5-in-microsoft-copilot-studio/" target="_blank" rel="">Claude Sonnet 4.5</a></span><span> are running on Azure in addition to AWS. Because otherwise the Office Agent won’t be as good with spreadsheets and docs like competing products that tap into the best LLM for the job.</span></p><p><span>How good is Office Agent then? Well, I did a quick test drive of the </span><span><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/excelblog/building-agent-mode-in-excel/4457320" target="_blank" rel="">Agent Mode in Excel</a></span><span>. Meaning, I installed the </span><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/agent-mode-in-excel-frontier-a2fd6fe4-97ac-416b-b89a-22f4d1357c7a" target="_blank" rel="">Excel Labs add-in</a></span><span> that seems to </span><span><strong>not</strong></span><span> require any Frontier program sign-up, contrary to what MS documentation says (that Copilot Frontier switch was erroring out in M365 Admin center for me, so I said </span><span><em>“f*** this”</em></span><span> and tried the tools without it). Then, I gave it a task: </span><span><em>“build me a 5-year investor-ready financial model for a SaaS startup.”</em></span><span> Like a user of our </span><span><a href="https://www.finmodeler.com/" target="_blank" rel="">FinModeler SaaS app</a></span><span> might do.</span></p><p><span>What was the result? 12 minutes of work, timing out after endless verifications and “finalizing” steps. Some numbers and formulas were added to the Excel workbook, sure. Would I trust this to be the type of financial model that I’d use in finding investors for my business? Hell no. So, it’s definitely a “vibes” kind of an LLM output that looks neat but you can’t build on top of.</span></p><div><p><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://youtube.com/embed/Bv1vOx1wCMw" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" title="Youtube embed"></iframe></p></div><p><span>The introduction of all these agents that are not yet part of the official M365 Copilot product yet gives an indication of the direction where Microsoft is taking their AI narrative. After </span><span><a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/use-the-forced-copilot" target="_blank" rel="">forcing consumers to pay for Copilot</a></span><span>, redirecting the </span><span><a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/i-created-a-better-office-com" target="_blank" rel="">Office home page</a></span><span> to AI chat instead, and making Copilot a toxic brand along the way, now’s the time to double down on agents. </span><span><em>“Oh, Copilot, yeah that’s just the UI for AI, but to do anything useful with it you’ll need the latest agents.”</em></span></p><p><span>That would be perfectly in line with the upcoming </span><span><a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/who-is-microsoft-agent-365" target="_blank" rel="">Microsoft 365 Agent product announcement</a></span><span> that’s supposed to take place at Ignite 2025. Given how quickly things change in the MS AI roulette table, it might of course not arrive in the format that Charles Lamanna was telling in the internal memo in August. But one thing that I’m increasingly confident of is that </span><span><strong>we will see a per-agent monetization model emerge</strong></span><span>. Simply because the per user M365 Copilot commercial model has failed so dramatically.</span></p><p><span>The latest announcement of </span><span><strong><em>“Bring Your Own Copilot”</em></strong></span><span> model with the new personal and family </span><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/10/01/meet-microsoft-365-premium-your-ai-and-productivity-powerhouse/" target="_blank" rel="">Microsoft 365 Premium SKU</a></span><span> is </span><span><u><strong>not</strong></u></span><span> a sign of the premium value of Copilot. On the contrary, the basic AI features in Office apps are now such a commodity that MS is simply creating a new model to allow individual employees to sneak in a paid Copilot license via their personal MS account into work context inside M365 tenants. Since only 2% of the workers had premium Copilot licenses anyway, getting a bigger audience opening the AI tools through any means necessary is now on the table.</span></p><p><span>And so we get the “BYOAI” model, something that will irritate every single enterprise IT admin, of course. But the thing is: a personal M365 Premium won’t unlock any of the premium features like MS Graph grounding for Copilot. Which should lead everyone to asking: “what exactly is premium anymore”? The answers from </span><span><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/employees-can-bring-copilot-from-their-personal-microsoft-365-plans-to-work---wh/4458212" target="_blank" rel="">this blog post</a></span><span> aren’t very detailed nor convincing:</span></p><div translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><p>❝</p><p><span><strong><em>Q: What features are available with personal Copilot subscriptions?</em></strong></span><br><span><em>A: Features like Researcher, Analyst, Photos Agent, and Actions may be available depending on the subscription tier. Additionally, users have access to the many in-app Copilot features when using the Microsoft 365 apps like rewrite, summarization, or discussion insights in Word; design suggestions and narrative builder in PowerPoint; and more.</em></span></p></div><p><span><em>“Copilot Actions?”</em></span><span> You mean that Ignite 2024 keynote highlight that was deprecated and </span><span><a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/the-secret-life-of-copilot-scheduled-prompts" target="_blank" rel="">removed from M365 Copilot by May 2025 already</a></span><span>? Because it was a half-assed attempt at chat driven automation, yet still resulted in a Microsoft 365 environment being provisioned for users of </span><span><a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/the-secret-life-of-copilot-scheduled-prompts" target="_blank" rel="">Copilot scheduled prompts</a></span><span> today?

Another way to create automations in M365! And now in a secret Power Platform environment you can't see in Maker portals!"</span></p></small></p></div><p><span>At this point, no one at Microsoft knows what their plan is — because they don’t have one. The masterplan of transforming becoming The Copilot Company, announced at Ignite 2023, has backfired commercially. Satya’s big bet is not working and now he is inviting </span><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789558/microsoft-ceo-commercial-judson-althoff-internal-memo" target="_blank" rel="">Judson Althoff to be the CEO of all things commercial at MS</a></span><span> while he focuses on the technical challenges of AI:</span></p><p><span>The announcement is framed as a “tectonic AI platform shift”. There isn’t any concrete context given on what specifically is not working in the current mode of operation at Microsoft, just the general notion that everyone at the company needs to do better in these unprecedented times. Aside from the key thing about Nadella making way to Althoff, it’s pretty shallow. Here’s how the internal memo ends:</span></p><div translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><p>❝</p><p><span><em>This will also allow our engineering leaders and me to be laser focused on our highest ambition technical work—across our datacenter buildout, systems architecture, AI science, and product innovation—to lead with intensity and pace in this generational platform shift. Each one of us needs to be at our very best in terms of rapidly learning new skills, adopting new ways to work, and staying close to the metal to drive innovation across the entire stack!!</em></span></p><p><span><em>This isn’t just evolution, it’s reinvention, for each of us professionally and for Microsoft.</em></span></p><p><span><em>Satya</em></span></p></div><p><span>See that </span><span><em>“this isn’t X, it’s Y”</em></span><span> part there? Yup, that’s classic GPT writing. In practice, Satya Nadella isn’t even writing these announcements that are sent to all MS employees anymore. It’s all just AI talk. If would be much more honest if the memo would have been signed by Copilot instead.</span></p><p><span>While we wait for it to be reimagined as the CEO Agent, with Copilot as the UI for it, of course.</span></p><p id="this-is-not-a-failure"><h2 translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><span>“This is not a failure!”</span></h2></p><p><span>After posting this newsletter issue </span><span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7379462621902757889/" target="_blank" rel="">on LinkedIn</a></span><span>, I got a lot of comments from Microsoft partners who disagreed with my interpretation of what the 8 million figure means. Hardly a surprise, given how much the business success of people selling and consulting M365 Copilot depends on the product being seen as something desirable.</span></p><p><span>I’m not saying all is lost for MS. My main point is that whatever they tried to pull off with the $30pupm M365 Copilot license backfired dramatically. Redmond will eventually “reimagine” things in a way that will let them put this failure behind them without ever actually addressing it. But we, the people working with Microsoft tech every day, deserve to know what happened and remember it the next time a similar stunt is played.</span></p><p><span>To illustrate my point, and give it a perspective that’s not just “my opinion with no facts whatsoever” (as some people on the professional network said), I asked Claude Sonnet 4.5 to crunch the same numbers. To do an analysis of the news sources and factors at play with M365 Copilot as a commercial offering, then evaluating whether it was </span><span><a href="https://jukka.short.gy/M365cop" target="_blank" rel="">success or spin</a></span><span>:</span></p><div><p><img src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,quality=80,format=auto,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/9d1c611c-3d36-4c18-ad6c-9008bb96b3a7/M365_Success_or_Spin.png" alt=""></p></div><p><span>You can </span><span><a href="https://jukka.short.gy/M365cop" target="_blank" rel="">open the interactive Claude artifact</a></span><span> yourself and answer a few questions in the quiz to see how your interpretation of Microsoft 365 Copilot commercial success aligns with what Claude thinks. It’s just a fun vibe coded thing, not to be taken too seriously, of course.
