<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p>The FBI violated the Fourth Amendment when its agents rifled through the contents of more than 700 safe-deposit boxes in the aftermath of <a href="https://reason.com/2021/05/10/the-fbi-seized-heirlooms-coins-and-cash-from-hundreds-of-safe-deposit-boxes-in-beverly-hills-despite-knowing-some-belonged-to-honest-citizens/">a March 2021 raid</a>, a panel of federal appeals court judges <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24372830-uspv-9th-cir-opinion">ruled unanimously</a> on Tuesday.</p> <p>In doing so, the judges at the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed what innocent victims of the raid and their attorneys have been arguing for years: that the FBI overstepped the bounds of its warrant issued in the case and failed to follow proper protocol when federal agents <a href="https://reason.com/2021/05/26/see-the-fbi-dig-through-an-innocent-womans-safe-deposit-box/">cracked open safe-deposit boxes</a>, ran the contents past drug-sniffing dogs, and tried to <a href="https://reason.com/2021/05/28/the-fbi-took-their-safe-deposit-box-and-everything-inside-it-two-months-later-theyre-still-waiting-for-it-to-be-returned/">seize some of the money and other valuables</a> found in the boxes.</p> <p>The 9th Circuit's ruling pivots on a detail of the case that <em>Reason&nbsp;</em>first highlighted more than a year ago: <a href="https://reason.com/2022/08/19/fbi-misled-judge-in-obtaining-warrant-to-seize-hundreds-of-safe-deposit-boxes/">the existence of so-called "supplemental instructions"</a> for the handling of the safe-deposit boxes seized at <a href="https://reason.com/tag/us-private-vaults/">U.S. Private Vaults</a> in Beverly Hills.</p> <p>The warrant authorizing the raid <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20700649-21-notice-of-motion-and-motion-for-return-of-property-pursuant-to-fed-r-crim-p-41g#document/p10">expressly forbade</a> federal agents from engaging in a "criminal search or seizure of the contents of the safety [sic] deposit boxes." Under typical FBI procedure, the boxes should have been taken into custody until they could be returned to their rightful owners. But those "supplemental instructions" drawn up by the special agent in charge of the operation told agents to be on the lookout for cash stored inside the safe-deposit boxes and to note "anything which suggests the cash may be criminal proceeds."</p> <p>It is "particularly troubling," <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24372830-uspv-9th-cir-opinion#document/p28">wrote</a> Judge Milan D. Smith Jr. in Tuesday's ruling, that the government was unable to provide any "limiting principle to how far a hypothetical 'inventory search' conducted pursuant to customized instructions can go."</p> <p>Elsewhere in the ruling, Smith <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24372830-uspv-9th-cir-opinion#document/p26">theorized</a> that if a government agency were "given the discretion to create customized inventory policies" for "each car it impounds and each person detained, the ensuing search stops looking like an 'inventory' meant to simply protect property and looks more like a criminal investigation of that particular car or person, i.e, more like a 'ruse.'"</p> <p>"If there remained any doubt whether the government conducted a 'criminal search or seizure,' that doubt is put to rest by the fact that the government has already used some of the information from inside the boxes to obtain additional warrants to further its investigations and begin new ones," Smith wrote.</p> <p>"The Ninth Circuit today held that the FBI violated the Fourth Amendment rights of hundreds of people by breaking into their safe deposit boxes to try to forfeit everything worth taking," Robert Frommer, an attorney with the Institute for Justice, a libertarian legal nonprofit that represented some of the plaintiffs in the case, tells <em>Reason</em>. He said the case should bring renewed attention to <a href="https://ij.org/press-release/bipartisan-bill-in-congress-would-dramatically-reform-civil-forfeiture-laws/">a congressional proposal to reform federal forfeiture laws</a> in order to "stop federal cops from continuing to act like robbers."</p> <p>A spokesperson for the FBI declined to comment on the ruling and referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney's Office, which did not respond to <em>Reason's</em> request for comment.</p> <p>The FBI's ruse in the U.S. Private Vault's case seemed to unravel after the district court in August 2021 made public certain details of the raid's planning stages that <a href="https://reason.com/2022/07/26/what-is-the-fbi-hiding-about-its-raid-on-innocent-americans-safe-deposit-boxes/">the FBI had tried to keep hidden</a>. Those documents, including depositions with agents involved in plotting the raid, revealed that the FBI had planned to use civil forfeiture proceedings against the contents of the safe-deposit boxes but did not provide that information to the magistrate judge who issued the warrant for the raid. (Full disclosure: <em>Reason&nbsp;</em>submitted an&nbsp;<em>amicus</em> brief in the case arguing that the depositions and other documents should be made public.)</p> <p>District Court Judge R. Gary Klausner later <a href="https://reason.com/2022/09/30/federal-judge-decides-safe-deposit-boxes-arent-safe-from-fbi/">ruled</a> that "there can be no question that the government expected, or even hoped, to find criminal evidence during its inventory." However, Klausner upheld the FBI's conduct as being within the bounds of the Fourth Amendment because the improper conduct was not the sole reason why the FBI opened the safe-deposit boxes and searched through their contents.</p> <p>The Ninth Circuit said Tuesday that Klausner was wrong to reach that conclusion and remanded the case back to the district court.</p> <p>In the ruling, Smith wrote that the arrangement called to mind the various "writs of assistance" used by the British authorities to conduct nearly limitless searches of private property prior to the Revolutionary War.</p> <p>"It was those very abuses of power, after all, that led to the adoption of the Fourth Amendment in the first place," Smith concluded.</p> <p>And it is cases like this one that should remind all Americans why the Fourth Amendment still matters today.</p>						</div></div>]]></description>

	<p><strong>By the Leeham News Team</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jan. 15, 2024, © Leeham News</strong>: It’s not supposed to happen.</p>
<p>The door plug on the Boeing 737-9 MAX isn’t supposed to separate from the airplane in flight, as it did on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 on Jan. 5 this year.</p>
<div id="attachment_43714"><p><a href="https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/B737-MAX-production.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43714" src="https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/B737-MAX-production.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/B737-MAX-production.jpg 1280w, https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/B737-MAX-production-300x169.jpg 300w, https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/B737-MAX-production-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/B737-MAX-production-768x432.jpg 768w, https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/B737-MAX-production-960x540.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-43714"><strong>There is conflicting reporting whether the emergency exit or door plug is opened on the Boeing 737 final assembly line for access to the interior. Examining Google images, two photos show the exit or plug closed while over-wing exits are open. Credit: Unknown.<br></strong></p></div>
<p>The investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is in its infancy. Early evidence suggests four bolts intended to prevent the door plug from shifting in its attachment brackets either failed or weren’t installed. Inspections after the 1282 incident by Alaska, and United Airlines found loose bolts in other MAX 9s. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Jan. 6 grounded the 171 MAX 9s operated by the two carriers until inspections and repairs, if needed, are completed.</p>
<div id="attachment_43715"><p><a href="https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/B737-900ER-Production.jpg"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43715" src="https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/B737-900ER-Production.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/B737-900ER-Production.jpg 1280w, https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/B737-900ER-Production-300x169.jpg 300w, https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/B737-900ER-Production-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/B737-900ER-Production-768x432.jpg 768w, https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/B737-900ER-Production-960x540.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-43715"><strong>This photo of a Boeing 737-900ER for Turkish Airlines shows a door plug closed on the 737 final assembly line.

<p>Boeing CEO David Calhoun, while <a href="https://aviationweek.com/air-transport/safety-ops-regulation/new-quality-problems-rock-boeing-trigger-faa-probe">telling CNBC that he wasn’t pointing fingers</a>, did precisely that. He said Spirit AeroSystems had a “quality escape,” adding that Boeing failed to catch it, so it also had a quality escape.</p>
<p>How could this happen? The NTSB probe will presumably figure this out. Spirit ships the 737-9 fuselages with the door plug installed. Conflicting reporting suggests that Spirit is supposed to install the door plugs in the final, secure condition; or these are shipped with the plugs in place but in a condition that Boeing would later secure. The NTSB will sort this out, too.</p>
<p>Regardless, Boeing should have inspected the door plugs and assured these are in final condition prior to delivery. <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-and-u-s-aerospace-set-back-by-alaska-airlines-fuselage-blowout/"><em>The Seattle Times</em> reported</a> on Jan. 14 that contrary to other reports, Boeing doesn’t open or remove the door plug when the MAX 9 is in final assembly. A retired Boeing safety employee with assembly line experience says Spirit ships the door plugs in a temporary condition, expecting that Boeing may remove them during final assembly.</p>

<h5><strong>Special inspection procedure of the door plug</strong></h5>
<p><em>LNA</em> outlined Boeing’s inspection procedures in <a href="https://leehamnews.com/2024/01/08/737-incidents-prompt-new-scrutiny-at-boeing/">a Jan. 8 post</a>. In the event, for whatever reason, Boeing does open or remove the door plug, there is a special procedure that should be followed to ensure the plug is properly reinstalled.</p>

</ul>
<hr>
<p>Here is that procedure.</p>
<p>The quality escapes referred to by Calhoun are inspection procedures. Failing to catch something in an inspection is also called an inspection escape.</p>
<p>What is outlined below is a theory, and not proven fact with the MAX 9 involved, or others in which discrepancies have been found. This procedure is related detailing Boeing’s procedure, just as <em>LNA’s</em> Jan. 8 post outlined procedures.</p>
<p>If Boeing, for any reason, removed the door plug on Alaska’s MAX 9, failure to reinstall the plug properly may not be an inspection escape. An inspection escape means that a planned installation/re-installation operation was inspected, and the mechanic and inspector got it wrong. While not impossible, this is a tough theory to accept, given the four-step inspection process outlined in the Jan. 8 post.</p>
<p>On the other hand, unplanned removal and installation calls for another procedure.</p>
<p>Boeing goes to great lengths to document unplanned removals by logging all the disassembly steps on the ship’s record paper.&nbsp; Quality Assurance inspects the reassembly process of the unplanned removal event.&nbsp; This door plug’s poor installation could, in theory, be the result of a production shortcut where the shop needed the door out of the way. The door could have been reinstalled incorrectly. The retired Boeing safety employee says the door plugs are often removed.</p>
<p>Unplanned removals happen “a lot,” the retired Boeing employee told <em>LNA.</em> “There are a multitude of reasons,” he said.</p>
<h5><strong>Cost-cutting on inspectors; new workforce</strong></h5>
<p>If the unplanned removal proves to hold water, and as noted, this is only hypothesis, then how could the inspection process break down? And how could experienced assembly line workers miss either escapes from Spirit or reinstalling the door plug properly?</p>
<p>The roots may go back years.</p>
<p>Under the regime of former CEO Dennis Muilenburg, quality inspectors were laid off and their duties assigned to others. Boeing’s touch-labor union, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/05/06/boeing-inspection-job-tech-crashes-outcry-737-max-poor-quality/3650026002/">the IAM 751, protested that this was unsafe</a>. The protests largely fell on deaf ears.</p>
<p>“I don’t call them quality escapes anymore. I call them safety escapes because Boeing doesn’t have a quality organization anymore,” the retired Boeing safety employee said. A procedure called “Quality Buyback” has been reduced over the years, he said.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.iam751.org/docs/May_2019_Aero.pdf">May 2019 <em>Aero Mechanic</em></a> employee newsletter, the IAM 751 wrote that it continued to object to Boeing’s plan to eliminate quality assurance inspectors. The union vowed to have its members “reveal instances where Boeing is not following its own internal process.”</p>
<p>“Removing inspections and discovering defects further down line will cause an abundance of out-of-sequence work, [and] more damage to the airplane through rework….”</p>
<p>“We have engaged…in what we see as a long battle to protect the integrity of our manufacturing process,” the union wrote in its newsletter.</p>
<p>When the MAX was grounded in May 2019 for what would be 21 months, Boeing laid off many of its final assembly line workers. When the COVID-19 pandemic began in May 2020, Boeing laid off or offered early retirement to thousands or workers company wide, including more from the 737 FAL.</p>
<p>When production resumes in May 2021, ahead of the recertification the following November, Boeing had to hire new employees without FAL experience. A learning curve is necessary for efficient production.</p>
<h5><strong>Returning the MAX 9 to service</strong></h5>
<p>The FAA grounded the US MAX 9s on Jan. 6. Some other airlines followed the FAA’s lead. Initially, it was thought that inspecting the door plugs and making any fixes would be a quick process. But more than a week later, the FAA was still requiring details from Boeing and that 40 inspections and repairs (if required) would have to be completed before return to service was approved.</p>
<p>Why is the FAA being so slow? There are a couple of theories.</p>
<p>The first is that the incident involves Boeing and the MAX. The FAA was burned by the certification process of the MAX in the beginning, which was revealed during the 2019 grounding and accident investigations of Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines. One theory suggests that the FAA isn’t going to get burned again.</p>
<p>It’s common knowledge within the airline community that the relationship between Boeing and the FAA has never recovered from the original MAX crisis. The FAA removed authority from Boeing to certify new MAXes as airworthy. The FAA must sign off on each delivery. This hand slapping was later extended to the 787 when production and quality problems were discovered at the Charleston final assembly line.</p>
<h5><strong>Certifying the MAX 7 and 10</strong></h5>
<p>Recertifying the MAX after the crash-related groundings proved to be an arduous process. So is certification of the MAX 7, which otherwise is ready to go, and the MAX 10, for which flight testing is in its early stages. But certification of the MAX 7 has taken far longer than anyone expected.</p>
<p>The FAA asks questions and Boeing responds. This generates more questions and more responses. And the cycle repeats, over and over again. Shortly before the Alaska incident, Boeing asked for an exemption for the MAX 7 from a safety regulation. Doubts already existed whether the FAA would grant the exemption. Now, doing so seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Another theory why the FAA is moving slowly on the MAX 9 is, perhaps unsurprisingly, politics. Some members of Congress were quick to demand hearings about the FAA oversight of Boeing, again. The FAA has, once more, come under criticism for its handling of the entire MAX history.</p>
<p>The FAA launched a formal investigation into the MAX 9 incident, in parallel to that of the NTSB.</p>
<p>The FAA is also expected to receive this month a draft of a safety audit authorized during the original MAX crisis. Members of the special committee included experts from across aviation. <em>LNA</em> has learned that the draft conclusions won’t be favorable to Boeing. There is no public release date of this report that’s been announced.</p>
<h5><strong>Stan Deal message to Employees</strong></h5>
<p>Boeing today made available a message to employees from Stan Deal, the CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It’s reprinted here in its entirety.</p>
<p><strong>Updates on 737-9 and quality actions</strong></p>
<p><em>***This message is to all Commercial Airplanes employees.*** </em></p>
<p>As we continue to respond to the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 accident, our team has been working with the five affected airlines to inspect their 737-9 fleet. They have been examining and collecting measurements around the mid-exit door plugs to ensure they are installed per specifications.</p>
<p>While we complete these tasks to earn Federal Aviation Administration approval to unground the affected 737-9s, our team is also taking a hard look at our quality practices in our factories and across our production system.</p>
<p>We have taken important steps in recent years to strengthen our Quality Management System’s (QMS) foundation and its layers of protection. But, the AS1282 accident and recent customer findings make clear that we are not where we need to be. To that end, we are taking immediate actions to bolster quality assurance and controls across our factories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More quality inspections</strong>: We are planning additional inspections throughout the build process at Boeing and at Spirit. These checks will provide one more layer of scrutiny on top of the thousands of inspections performed today across each 737 airplane, and build on the reviews we have implemented to catch potential non-conformances. Since 2019, we have increased the number of Commercial Airplanes quality inspectors by 20% and we plan to make more investments in the Quality function.</li>
<li><strong>Team sessions on quality</strong>: We are planning additional sessions for our teams to gather and refocus on the fundamentals of our QMS, take advantage of our expanded training programs, and recommit to improving quality and compliance.</li>
<li><strong>Boeing review of Spirit work</strong>: We have deployed a team to work alongside Spirit AeroSystems to complement the existing teammates on the ground. Our team is now inspecting Spirit’s installation of the mid-exit door plug and approving them before the fuselage section can be shipped to Boeing. We are also inspecting more than 50 other points in Spirit’s build process and assessing their build plans against engineering specifications.</li>
<li><strong>Airline oversight inspections</strong>: We are opening our factories to 737 operators for additional oversight inspections to review our production and quality procedures. Spirit will do the same and we will learn from our customers’ insights and findings.</li>
<li><strong>Independent assessment</strong>: An outside party will be brought in to thoroughly review the Quality Management System at Commercial Airplanes and suggest further improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>And as we prepare new 737-9s for delivery, we will conduct the same thorough inspections of the mid-exit door plugs as mandated by the FAA. Customer representatives will continue to have access to anything they want to see onboard their airplane before delivery.</p>
<p>These actions are separate from the FAA’s investigation and the agency’s plan to increase oversight of 737-9 production. We will cooperate fully and transparently with both as we work to restore trust with our regulator and our customers. And as the National Transportation Safety Board’s investigation proceeds, we will take additional steps to improve our practices as the facts and findings dictate.</p>
<p>Everything we do must conform to the requirements in our QMS. Anything less is unacceptable. It is through this standard that we must operate to provide our customers and their passengers complete confidence in Boeing airplanes. Let each one of us take personal accountability and recommit ourselves to this important work.</p>
<p>Stan<br>

							<p>Kate Judson is a lawyer who often deals with crimes that did not occur. As the executive director of the Wisconsin-based <a href="https://cifsjustice.org/#/main" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cifsjustice.org/%23/main&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1705604803033000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2uDaJCq7jNDEQ_CzWL8msb">Center for Integrity in Forensic Sciences (CIFS)</a>, her job is to examine ostensible scientific evidence to see whether it backs up prosecutors' claims.</p> <p>"Some people who died were classified as victims of homicide when they were really the victim of illness, or accident, or suicide, or medical error—that kind of thing," says Judson. "We had a case of a family that lost their child. The caregiver was accused of attacking her. It was later discovered, based on new medical evidence, that the child had been really ill with a disease she was probably born with."</p> <p>Evidence can't bring a child back, obviously. But it can get an innocent person out of jail. And it can give a grieving family some peace of mind. To learn that your child "was held and comforted in their last moments, instead of attacked," says Judson, "would be important to know."</p> <p>When the center was founded four years ago, Judson left her job as a public defender to become its first employee. Now a staff of four works to keep bad science out of the courtroom. This includes:</p> <p><b>Ballistics:</b> Scientific proof "that you can match a projectile to its weapon is just not there," says Judson. While you can tell if a bullet comes from a particular <i>type</i> of gun— say, a Glock—that doesn't mean you can identify the specific gun that fired the bullet.</p> <p>In the seminal case <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/02/28/dc-judge-issues-much-needed-opinion-junk-science/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/02/28/dc-judge-issues-much-needed-opinion-junk-science/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1705604803033000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2iqaOh5UfpSElYeA93rh-x"><i>United States v. Tibbs</i></a>, a D.C. Superior Court judge ruled that a ballistics expert could not testify that a gun discarded by Marquette Tibbs near a crime scene was indisputably the source of the casings found there. Why not? Because the ballistics field is really shaky, the judge determined, and lacks "validity."</p> <p><b>Hair identification:</b>&nbsp;In 2009, the National Research Council published <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/228091.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/228091.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1705604803033000&amp;usg=AOvVaw06YGnU2m69bV67pvOTJEmw">a report about forensic science</a> "and that really marked a turning point in the birth of the forensic reform movement," says Judson. "It was the first time a big government agency brought together scientific experts and legal experts and said, 'Let's talk about what they're saying in court and whether it passes scientific muster.'"</p> <p>One big topic was hair samples. A hair with its root can provide actual DNA evidence, says Judson. But other comparisons of color and texture, even examined under the microscope, have led to many wrongful convictions. She points to the case of Santae Tribble, convicted of murder at 17, despite evidence that he had been elsewhere when the crime occurred.</p> <p>An FBI analyst at his trial testified that there was just a one in 10 million chance that the hair found on a stocking mask at the crime scene belonged to someone other than Tribble.</p> <p>But after spending over 20 years in prison, Tribble was cleared when the hairs were retested and <a href="https://www.davisvanguard.org/2020/08/fbi-hair-analysis-called-into-question-after-santae-tribbles-2012-exoneration/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.davisvanguard.org/2020/08/fbi-hair-analysis-called-into-question-after-santae-tribbles-2012-exoneration/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1705604803033000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1brU21CsaOaUyM7NQvIJLe">none of them matched</a>. (At least one was dog hair.)</p> <p>The Innocence Project, which works closely with the CIFS, got the FBI to admit that "even when hairs seem microscopically indistinguishable," it really couldn't say how unique those similarities are.</p> <p><b>Bite marks:</b> "They're not even good at counting the number of teeth," says Judson.</p> <p>One of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/09/08/seventh-circuit-grants-immunity-to-bite-mark-experts-who-put-innocent-man-in-prison-for-23-years/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/09/08/seventh-circuit-grants-immunity-to-bite-mark-experts-who-put-innocent-man-in-prison-for-23-years/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1705604803033000&amp;usg=AOvVaw28JVpP4clnfDDpcutgcxbv">more famous bite mark cases</a> involved a woman raped, beaten, bitten, and stabbed to death in Wisconsin in 1984. A dental scientist named Lowell Thomas Johnson said the marks came from someone missing a tooth. When a neighbor, Robert Stinson, was questioned—and seen missing a tooth—he was charged with murder. The bite marks were the only evidence against him.</p> <p>He served 23 years. Then the Wisconsin Innocence Project got hold of the DNA of the saliva and blood on the victim's sweater. These didn't belong to Stinson. Instead, they belonged to another prisoner, Moses Price, who was serving 35 years for committing a subsequent murder. Price confessed, and Stinson was exonerated.</p> <p><b>Arson:</b>&nbsp;"Have you ever seen, in a campfire, a piece of wood that looks like alligator scales?" asks Judson. "It's called 'alligatoring." Until recently, it was considered an indicator of arson.</p> <p>Another supposed indicator was "something they used to call 'crazed glass,'" Judson says. "It's a pattern of breakage that they used to say came from arson. But after, again, real scientific experimentation, it turns out that that happens when hot glass gets water poured on it."</p> <p>Forensic analysts have been able to prove that even when a house burns down inadvertently, there can be evidence of crazed glass and alligatoring.</p> <p>"They found that fires, whether or not they involve any arson, whether or not they involve any accelerants, can get to the point that it's so hot that the air becomes super-heated and everything ignites at once," she says.</p> <p><b>Shaken babies:</b> A theory used to hold that if a baby died, and an autopsy found some specific symptoms—including bleeding behind the eyes—the child had likely been shaken to death.</p> <p>Then, 10 years ago, physicians Marcus Salvatori and Patrick Lantz had a novel idea: They performed autopsies on four children ages 3 and under who had died from infections. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0025802414527077?journalCode=msla">Those infants</a>&nbsp;had evidence of bleeding behind the eyes as well.</p> <p><a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/law-needs-to-keep-up-with-science-in-shaken-baby-syndrome-cases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/law-needs-to-keep-up-with-science-in-shaken-baby-syndrome-cases&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1705604803033000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1qWkoU4mLZwr3jJSQ8-zWw">At least 30 people</a> have been exonerated after serving years or decades for supposedly shaking a baby to death.</p> <p>"You don't expect kids to die, but the truth is, some do," says Judson. "And some die with unexplained bleeding."</p> <p>That can lead to a conviction, even though a crime never occurred.</p>						</div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><img alt="Title image" src="https://ai.stanford.edu/~zayd/images/title.png"></p>
<p>There have been tremendous advances made in making machine learning more accessible over the past few years. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120">Online</a> <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">courses</a>  have emerged, well-written textbooks have gathered cutting edge research into an easier to digest format and countless frameworks have emerged to abstract the low level messiness associated with building machine learning systems. In some cases these advancements have made it possible to drop an existing model into your application with a basic understanding of how the algorithm works and a few lines of code.</p>
<p>However, machine learning remains a relatively ‘hard’ problem.  There is no doubt the science of advancing machine learning algorithms through research is difficult. It requires creativity, experimentation and tenacity.   Machine learning remains a hard problem when implementing existing algorithms and models to <em>work well</em> for your new application. Engineers specializing in machine learning continue to command a salary premium in the job market over standard software engineers. </p>
<p>This difficulty is often not due to math - because of the aforementioned frameworks machine learning implementations do not require intense mathematics.  An aspect of this difficulty involves building an intuition for what tool should be leveraged to solve a problem. This requires being aware of available algorithms and models and the trade-offs and constraints of each one. By itself this skill is learned through exposure to these models (classes, textbooks and papers) but even more so by attempting to implement and test out these models yourself. However, this type of knowledge building exists in all areas of computer science and is not unique to machine learning. Regular software engineering requires awareness of the trade offs of competing frameworks, tools and techniques and judicious design decisions.</p>
<p>The difficulty is that machine learning is a fundamentally hard debugging problem. Debugging for machine learning happens in two cases: 1) your algorithm doesn't work or 2) your algorithm doesn't work <em>well enough</em>. 
What is unique about machine learning is that it is ‘exponentially’ harder to figure out what is wrong when things don’t work as expected.  Compounding this debugging difficulty, there is often a delay in debugging cycles between implementing a fix or upgrade and seeing the result. Very rarely does an algorithm work the first time and so this ends up being where the majority of time is spent in building algorithms.</p>
<h2>Exponentially Difficult Debugging</h2>
<p>In standard software engineering when you craft a solution to a problem and something doesn’t work as expected in most cases you have two dimensions along which things could have gone wrong: algorithmic or implementation issues. For example, take the case of a simple recursive algorithm:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>recursion</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>):</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>input</span> <span>is</span> <span>endCase</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>transform</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span>
  <span>else</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>recursion</span><span>(</span><span>transform</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We can enumerate the failure cases when the code does not work as expected. In this example the grid might look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="2-D Grid" src="https://ai.stanford.edu/~zayd/images/lattice.png"></p>
<p>Along the horizontal axis we have a few examples of where we might have made a mistake in the algorithm design. And along the vertical axis we have a few examples of where things might have gone wrong in the implementation of the algorithm. Along any one dimension we might have a combination of issues (i.e. multiple implementation bugs) but the only time we will have a working solution is if both the algorithm and the implementation are correct.</p>
<p>The debugging process then becomes a matter of combining the signals you have about the bug (compiler error messages, program outputs etc.) with your intuition on where the problem might be. These signals and heuristics help you prune the search space of possible bugs into something manageable. </p>
<p>In the case of machine learning pipelines there are two additional dimensions along which bugs are common: the actual model and the data. To illustrate these dimensions, the simplest example is of training logistic regression using stochastic gradient descent. Here algorithm correctness includes correctness of the gradient descent update equations. Implementation correctness includes correct computations of the features and parameter updates. Bugs in the data often involve noisy labels, mistakes made in preprocessing, not having the right supervisory signal or even not enough data. Bugs in the model may involve actual limitations in the modeling capabilities. For example, this may be using a linear classifier when your true decision boundaries are non-linear. </p>
<p><img alt="3-D Grid" src="https://ai.stanford.edu/~zayd/images/lattice2.png"></p>
<p>Our debugging process goes from a 2D grid to a 4D hypercube (three out of four dimensions drawn above for clarity). The fourth data dimension can be visualized as a sequence of these cubes (note that there is only one cube with a <strong>correct</strong> solution). </p>
<p><img alt="4-D" src="https://ai.stanford.edu/~zayd/images/lattice3.png"></p>
<p>The reason this is 'exponentially' harder is because if there are <strong>n</strong> possible ways things could go wrong in one dimension there are <strong>n</strong> x <strong>n</strong> ways things could go wrong in 2D and <strong>n</strong> x <strong>n</strong> x <strong>n</strong> x <strong>n</strong> ways things can go wrong in 4D. It becomes essential to build an intuition for where something went wrong based on the signals available. Luckily for machine learning algorithms you also have more signals to figure out where things went wrong. For example, signals that are particularly useful are plots of your loss function on your training and test sets, actual output from your algorithm on your development data set and summary statistics of the intermediate computations in your algorithm.</p>
<h2>Delayed Debugging Cycles</h2>
<p>The second compounding factor that complicates machine learning debugging is long debugging cycles. It is often tens of hours or days between implementing a potential fix and getting a resulting signal on whether the change was successful. We know from web development that development modes that enable auto-refresh significantly improve developer productivity. This is because you are able to minimize disruptions to the development flow. This is often not possible in machine learning - training an algorithm on your data set might take on the order of hours or days. Models in deep learning are particularly prone to these delays in debugging cycles. Long debugging cycles force a 'parallel' experimentation paradigm. Machine learning developers will run multiple experiments because the bottleneck is often the training of the algorithm. By doing things in parallel you hope to exploit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_pipelining">instruction pipelining</a> (for the developer not the processor). The major disadvantage of being forced to work in this way is that you are unable to leverage the cumulative knowledge you build as you sequentially debug or experiment.</p>
<p>Machine learning often boils down to the art of developing an intuition for where something went wrong (or could work better) when there are many dimensions of things that could go wrong (or work better). This is a key skill that you develop as you continue to build out machine learning projects: you begin to associate certain behavior signals with where the problem likely is in your debugging space. In my own work there are many examples of this. For example, one of the earliest issues I ran into while training neural networks was periodicity in my training loss function. The loss function would decay as it went over the data but every so often it would jump back up to a higher value. After much trial and error I eventually learned that this is often the case of a training set that has not been correctly randomized (it was an implementation issue that looked like a data issue) and is a problem when you are using stochastic gradient algorithms that process the data in small batches.</p>
<p>In conclusion, fast and effective debugging is the skill that is most required for implementing modern day machine learning pipelines.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>For a software engineer, the hardest thing about developing Machine Learning functionality <em>should</em> be finding clean and representative ground-truth data, but it often isn’t. If you already have a source of good quality data (perhaps because it is already gathered by your application), here are some obstacles that still lay ahead of you:</p>

<h2 id="learning-ml">Learning ML</h2>

<p>ML concepts are hard to understand. The industry is still mostly in the research phase, with the beginnings of a movement towards making systems and learning resources consumable by the average developer. Books and libraries like <a href="https://www.fast.ai/">FastAI</a> are examples of this movement, but it still takes days or weeks to learn how to do the most basic things.</p>

<p>To do something basic like image classification, you have to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understand concepts like tensors, loss functions, transfer-learning, logistic regression, network fine-tuning, hyper-parameter search, over-fitting, active learning, regularization, and quantization.</li>
  <li>Get familiar with one or more ML libraries like PyTorch, Tensorflow, FastAI, or scikit-learn. This is harder than getting familiar with a normal programming library because the concepts and paradigms are very different from what programmers are used to.</li>
  <li>Find state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep neural networks for images from research and industry. Continue to search for new SOTA networks to keep up with industry improvements.</li>
  <li>Make sure the deep networks are pre-trained on the appropriate corpus of data. Training networks from scratch is not a good idea, and the type of data used for pre-training really matters.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>You’ll need software to for data exploration and management to do things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Visualize key data statistics, like relative frequency of classes</li>
  <li>Find similar/different data samples</li>
  <li>Mine for instances of rare classes</li>
  <li>Debug data labeling mistakes</li>
  <li>Implement ‘active learning’ - focus on labeling high-value samples to reduce the amount of data you have to label</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll also need software to track various experiments and resulting model accuracies, and to monitor the performance of your model after you start using it in production.</p>

<p>There are companies that solve parts of these - like <a href="https://www.aquariumlearning.com/">Aquarium Learning</a> for data management and <a href="https://wandb.ai/site">Weights and Biases</a> for experiment tracking. You’ll have to evaluate these and stitch together a solution that involves multiple vendors and systems. Also, as you can probably see from the data management list above, things like active learning and finding labeling mistakes require interfacing with the ML model being developed.</p>

<h2 id="infrastructure-and-mlops">Infrastructure and MLOps</h2>

<p>Once you’ve figured out the ML and software bits, you’ll need cloud infrastructure expertise in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Evaluate various hardware choices for cost-performance trade-offs for both training and inference.</li>
  <li>Set up a fast, elastic, and cost-effective training pipeline. To provide an interactive and responsive experience when training and re-training during active learning, the speed of scaling infrastructure up and down is important.</li>
  <li>Set up low-latency, elastic, highly-available, and cost-effective inference close to your data.</li>
  <li>Monitor cloud systems and software for performance, availability, and utilization.</li>
</ul>

<p>These concerns are usually called “MLOps”. There are various companies, like <a href="https://valohai.com/">Valohai</a> and <a href="https://www.determined.ai/">Determined</a> that will solve some or all of it for you. You’ll have to evaluate them and figure out how they fit into your larger system.</p>

<h2 id="system-maintenance">System Maintenance</h2>

<p>If you’re lucky enough to get this far, you’re left with a large system stitched together from multiple components that you have to operate, maintain, and tweak. The maintenance applies not just to the software and infrastructure, but also to the ML pieces that have to be kept abreast of the latest ML techniques in order to get competitive performance.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-means">What This Means</h2>

<p>Together, these present a formidable barrier of entry to developing ML functionality. Yes, you will scale that barrier if the incentives are sufficiently lucrative. But we’ve heard from ML teams at fairly large companies that even they don’t attempt some projects because the benefits don’t outweigh this cost. Even answering the question “<em>Can</em> ML solve my problem?” requires you to overcome half of the challenges outlined above. Imagine all the missed opportunities and problems left unsolved, especially at innovative small companies and startups.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-future-looks-like">What the Future Looks Like</h2>

<p>The story of software is about lowering barriers like these, leading to inventive developers solving problems that were not even considered before. Nyckel was born out of our frustration with trying to solve a relatively simple problem (custom curation of user-generated text) using ML, and we want to continue this story.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post_message_3757239">
						
						<p><a href="http://https/" target="_blank">https://leehamnews.com/2024/01/15/unplanned-removal-installation-inspection-procedure-at-boeing/#comment-509962</a></p><p>

Current Boeing employee here � I will save you waiting two years for the NTSB report to come out and give it to you for free: the reason the door blew off is stated in black and white in Boeings own records. It is also very, very stupid and speaks volumes about the quality culture at certain portions of the business.</p><p>

A couple of things to cover before we begin:</p><p>

Q1) Why should we believe you?<br>
A) You shouldn�t, I�m some random throwaway account, do your own due diligence. Others who work at Boeing can verify what I say is true, but all I ask is you consider the following based on its own merits.</p><p>

Q2) Why are you doing this?<br>
A) Because there are many cultures at Boeing, and while the executive culture may be throughly compromised since we were bought by McD, there are many other people who still push for a quality product with cutting edge design. My hope is that this is the wake up call that finally forces the Board to take decisive action, and remove the executives that are resisting the necessary cultural changes to return to a company that values safety and quality above schedule.</p><p>

With that out of the way� why did the left hand (LH) mid-exit door plug blow off of the 737-9 registered as N704AL? Simple- as has been covered in a number of articles and videos across aviation channels, there are 4 bolts that prevent the mid-exit door plug from sliding up off of the door stop fittings that take the actual pressurization loads in flight, and these 4 bolts were not installed when Boeing delivered the airplane, our own records reflect this.</p><p>

The mid-exit doors on a 737-9 of both the regular and plug variety come from Spirit already installed in what is supposed to be the final configuration and in the Renton factory, there is a job for the doors team to verify this �final� install and rigging meets drawing requirements. In a healthy production system, this would be a �belt and suspenders� sort of check, but the 737 production system is quite far from healthy, its a rambling, shambling, disaster waiting to happen. As a result, this check job that should find minimal defects has in the past 365 calendar days recorded 392 nonconforming findings on 737 mid fuselage door installations (so both actual doors for the high density configs, and plugs like the one that blew out). That is a hideously high and very alarming number, and if our quality system on 737 was healthy, it would have stopped the line and driven the issue back to supplier after the first few instances. Obviously, this did not happen. Now, on the incident aircraft this check job was completed on 31 August 2023, and did turn up discrepancies, but on the RH side door, not the LH that actually failed. I could blame the team for missing certain details, but given the enormous volume of defects they were already finding and fixing, it was inevitable something would slip through- and on the incident aircraft something did. I know what you are thinking at this point, but grab some popcorn because there is a plot twist coming up.</p><p>

The next day on 1 September 2023 a different team (remember 737s flow through the factory quite quickly, 24 hours completely changes who is working on the plane) wrote up a finding for damaged and improperly installed rivets on the LH mid-exit door of the incident aircraft.</p><p>

A brief aside to explain two of the record systems Boeing uses in production. The first is a program called CMES which stands for something boring and unimportant but what is important is that CMES is the sole authoritative repository for airplane build records (except on 787 which uses a different program). If a build record in CMES says something was built, inspected, and stamped in accordance with the drawing, then the airplane damn well better be per drawing. The second is a program called SAT, which also stands for something boring and unimportant but what is important is that SAT is *not* an authoritative records system, its a bullentin board where various things affecting the airplane build get posted about and updated with resolutions. You can think of it sort of like a idiots version of Slack or something. Wise readers will already be shuddering and wondering how many consultants were involved, because, yes SAT is a *management visibilty tool*. Like any good management visibilty tool, SAT can generate metrics, lots of metrics, and oh God do Boeing managers love their metrics. As a result, SAT postings are the primary topic of discussion at most daily status meetings, and the whole system is perceived as being extremely important despite, I reiterate, it holding no actual authority at all.</p><p>

We now return to our incident aircraft, which was written up for having defective rivets on the LH mid-exit door. Now as is standard practice kn Renton (but not to my knowledge in Everett on wide bodies) this write-up happened in two forms, one in CMES, which is the correct venue, and once in SAT to �coordinate the response� but really as a behind-covering measure so the manager of the team that wrote it can show his boss he�s shoved the problem onto someone else. Because there are so many problems with the Spirit build in the 737, Spirit has teams on site in Renton performing warranty work for all of their shoddy quality, and this SAT promptly gets shunted into their queue as a warranty item. Lots of bickering ensues in the SAT messages, and it takes a bit for Spirit to get to the work package. Once they have finished, they send it back to a Boeing QA for final acceptance, but then Malicious Stupid Happens! The Boeing QA writes another record in CMES (again, the correct venue) stating (with pictures) that Spirit has not actually reworked the discrepant rivets, they *just painted over the defects*. In Boeing production speak, this is a �process failure�. For an A&amp;P mechanic at an airline, this would be called �federal crime�.</p><p>

Presented with evidence of their malfeasance, Spirit reopens the package and admits that not only did they not rework the rivets properly, there is a damaged pressure seal they need to replace (who damaged it, and when it was damaged is not clear to me). The big deal with this seal, at least according to frantic SAT postings, is the part is not on hand, and will need to be ordered, which is going to impact schedule, and (reading between the lines here) Management is Not Happy. 1/2</p><p>

However, more critical for purposes of the accident investigation, the pressure seal is unsurprisingly sandwiched between the plug and the fuselage, and you cannot replace it without opening the door plug to gain access. All of this conversation is documented in increasingly aggressive posts in the SAT, but finally we get to the damning entry which reads something along the lines of �coordinating with the doors team to determine if the door will have to be removed entirely, or just opened. If it is removed then a Removal will have to be written.� Note: a Removal is a type of record in CMES that requires formal sign off from QA that the airplane been restored to drawing requirements.</p><p>

If you have been paying attention to this situation closely, you may be able to spot the critical error: regardless of whether the door is simply opened or removed entirely, the 4 retaining bolts that keep it from sliding off of the door stops have to be pulled out. A removal should be written in either case for QA to verify install, but as it turns out, someone (exactly who will be a fun question for investigators) decides that the door only needs to be opened, and no formal Removal is generated in CMES (the reason for which is unclear, and a major process failure). Therefore, in the official build records of the airplane, a pressure seal that cannot be accessed without opening the door (and thereby removing retaining bolts) is documented as being replaced, but the door is never officially opened and thus no QA inspection is required.<br>
This entire sequence is documented in the SAT, and the nonconformance records in CMES address the damaged rivets and pressure seal, but at no point is the verification job reopened, or is any record of removed retention bolts created, despite it this being a physical impossibility. Finally with Spirit completing their work to Boeing QAs satisfaction, the two rivet-related records in CMES are stamped complete, and the SAT closed on 19 September 2023. No record or comment regarding the retention bolts is made.</p><p>

I told you it was stupid.</p><p>

So, where are the bolts? Probably sitting forgotten and unlabeled (because there is no formal record number to label them with) on a work-in-progress bench, unless someone already tossed them in the scrap bin to tidy up.</p><p>

There�s lots more to be said about the culture that enabled this to happened, but thats the basic details of what happened, the NTSB report will say it in more elegant terms in a few years.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            We present the Hourglass Diffusion Transformer (HDiT), an image generative model that exhibits linear scaling with pixel count, supporting training at high-resolution (e.g. 1024<sup>2</sup>) directly in pixel-space.
            Building on the Transformer architecture, which is known to scale to billions of parameters, it bridges the gap between the efficiency of convolutional U-Nets and the scalability of Transformers.

            HDiT trains successfully without typical high-resolution training techniques such as multiscale architectures, latent autoencoders or self-conditioning.
            We demonstrate that HDiT performs competitively with existing models on ImageNet-256<sup>2</sup>, and sets a new state-of-the-art for diffusion models on FFHQ-1024<sup>2</sup>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.brex.com/journal/a-message-from-our-founder">https://www.brex.com/journal/a-message-from-our-founder</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39107144">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote>Today, Brex Founder and co-CEO Pedro Franceschi sent the following note to Brex employees: </blockquote><p>Team,</p><p>Today we’re restructuring Brex to become a high-velocity company. While our strategy and mission remain the same, we’re making some important changes today that will increase the intensity and quality of our execution.</p><p>Sadly as part of those changes, 282 people (roughly 20% of the company) will be leaving Brex today. Henrique and I are responsible for the decisions that led us here, and seeing so many talented folks go through this experience is never what you hope for as a founder. It’s incredibly hard to say goodbye, and we feel so grateful for their contributions building Brex into what it is now. We’re doing what we can do to ease the transition, and departing employees will receive:<br></p><ul><li>8 weeks of severance, with two additional weeks of pay for each additional year of service.</li><li>Waiver of the one-year equity cliff for those who haven’t reached theirs yet.<br></li><li>Outplacement support for job search assistance, and impacted people will be able to keep their laptops to assist with the transition.<br></li><li>Subsidized continued health coverage for 6 months through COBRA, including mental health support.<br></li></ul><p>I also want to offer more context on how we got to this decision. Since starting Brex in 2017, we’ve had one goal: deeply integrating fintech and software into a single platform that empowers teams to make better financial decisions. We started as a corporate card, and in six years, became the leader in the spend management space. Today we’re proud to serve 1 in every 3 startups in the US, tens of thousands of businesses from public launch to global public companies, and in 2023 alone, hundreds of thousands of new customers’ employees that are now using Brex to make better financial decisions.</p><p>To continue capturing the massive opportunity ahead, we’re hyper-focused on <strong>building a high-velocity product and growth machine</strong>. Looking inward, I realized we grew our org too quickly, making it harder to move at the speed we once did. This year, we decided to take a hard look at our current structure, and reduce the number of layers between leaders and the actual work that affects customers. This resulted in today’s hard decision. In addition, we’re also making the following changes to how we run the company:<br></p><p><strong>1. We’re flattening our org structure and reducing layers of management.</strong> Our goal is for leaders to operate closer to the metal, less siloed and more functionally, focused on few cross-company priorities. These changes begin with the leadership team and cascade across the org:<br></p><blockquote><strong>a. </strong>Michael Tannenbaum is transitioning from COO to a Brex board member. Camilla Morais is being promoted to COO and will report directly to me, together with our CFO Ben Gammell. Michael was our 2nd employee, and Brex wouldn’t exist without him. I can’t wait to continue working with Michael on our board.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>b.</strong> Cosmin Nicolaescu is transitioning from CTO into an advisor role this summer. James Reggio is being promoted to VP of Engineering and will report directly to me, together with Matt Bango, our VP of Design. Cos played a critical role building our engineering org and product for over 5 years, and I feel so grateful for all his contributions to Brex.</blockquote><p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>We’re emphasizing long-term thinking and ownership over short-term gains in our comp structure.</strong> The opportunity ahead of Brex is massive, and we want everyone staying to have high conviction and financial upside in our equity.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>We’re changing our operating model</strong>, expecting leaders to <a data-testid="rebirth-link" target="_self" href="https://www.brex.com/journal/operate-at-all-levels">operate at all levels</a> moving forward, promoting from within, increasing in-person collaboration in our hubs, and concentrating the time zones in which we operate.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>We're expanding on the financial improvements from 2023</strong>. With our focus on financial software and high-quality growth, we grew gross profit by 75%+ last year. While we're proud of those accomplishments, we still have a way to go to ensure high-velocity growth and profitability for years to come. Combined, these changes enable us to get there and become cash flow positive with the money we have in the bank.  </p><p>I’ll host an All Hands tomorrow to talk about how we’ll operate moving forward. While it’s incredibly hard to see so many talented teammates leave, I’m optimistic about this new phase of Brex: leaner, faster, and closer to customers.</p><p>This won’t be an easy change, but it’s a worthy one. While we’ve grown to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue in a short span of time, Brex still serves less than 1% of the US market, and over the next few years, the opportunity ahead of us remains massive. Every single business needs to manage spend, and that’s much bigger than just helping them reduce costs. The goal of any finance team is to empower employees to make the best financial decisions that move their business forward. That’s precisely Brex’s mission and our right to win.<br></p><p>We have a unique opportunity over the next 5-10 years, and these changes will increase the intensity and quality of our execution, connecting us more deeply to customers needs, and putting us on a clear path towards profitability and independence. I feel so confident in this team’s ability to rise to the occasion and continue building a generational company.<br></p><p>Onwards,</p><p>Pedro</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-slug="/blog/deadcode">
    
    <h2><a href="https://go.dev/blog/">The Go Blog</a></h2>
    

    
      
      
      
      <p>Functions that are part of your project’s source code but can never be
reached in any execution are called “dead code”, and they exert a drag
on codebase maintenance efforts.
Today we’re pleased to share a tool named <code>deadcode</code> to help you identify them.</p>
<pre><code>$ go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/deadcode@latest
$ deadcode -help
The deadcode command reports unreachable functions in Go programs.

Usage: deadcode [flags] package...
</code></pre>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Over the last year or so, we’ve been making a lot of changes to the
structure of <a href="https://go.dev/blog/gopls-scalability">gopls</a>, the
language server for Go that powers VS Code and other editors.
A typical change might rewrite some existing function, taking care to
ensure that its new behavior satisfies the needs of all existing callers.
Sometimes, after putting in all that effort, we would discover to our
frustration that one of the callers was never actually reached in any
execution, so it could safely have been been deleted.
If we had known this beforehand our refactoring task would have been
easier.</p>
<p>The simple Go program below illustrates the problem:</p>
<pre><code>module example.com/greet
go 1.21
</code></pre>
<pre><code>package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var g Greeter
    g = Helloer{}
    g.Greet()
}

type Greeter interface{ Greet() }

type Helloer struct{}
type Goodbyer struct{}

var _ Greeter = Helloer{}  // Helloer  implements Greeter
var _ Greeter = Goodbyer{} // Goodbyer implements Greeter

func (Helloer) Greet()  { hello() }
func (Goodbyer) Greet() { goodbye() }

func hello()   { fmt.Println("hello") }
func goodbye() { fmt.Println("goodbye") }
</code></pre>
<p>When we execute it, it says hello:</p>
<pre><code>$ go run .
hello
</code></pre>
<p>It’s clear from its output that this program executes the <code>hello</code>
function but not the <code>goodbye</code> function.
What’s less clear at a glance is that the <code>goodbye</code> function can
never be called.
However, we can’t simply delete <code>goodbye</code>, because it’s required by the
<code>Goodbyer.Greet</code> method, which in turn is required to implement the
<code>Greeter</code> interface whose <code>Greet</code> method we can see is called from <code>main</code>.
But if we work forwards from main, we can see that no <code>Goodbyer</code> values
are ever created, so the <code>Greet</code> call in <code>main</code> can only reach <code>Helloer.Greet</code>.
That’s the idea behind the algorithm used by the <code>deadcode</code> tool.</p>
<p>When we run deadcode on this program, the tool tells us that the
<code>goodbye</code> function and the <code>Goodbyer.Greet</code> method are both unreachable:</p>
<pre><code>$ deadcode .
greet.go:23: unreachable func: goodbye
greet.go:20: unreachable func: Goodbyer.Greet
</code></pre>
<p>With this knowledge, we can safely remove both functions,
along with the <code>Goodbyer</code> type itself.</p>
<p>The tool can also explain why the <code>hello</code> function is live. It responds
with a chain of function calls that reaches <code>hello</code>, starting from main:</p>
<pre><code>$ deadcode -whylive=example.com/greet.hello .
                  example.com/greet.main
dynamic@L0008 --&gt; example.com/greet.Helloer.Greet
 static@L0019 --&gt; example.com/greet.hello
</code></pre>
<p>The output is designed to be easy to read on a terminal, but you can
use the <code>-json</code> or <code>-f=template</code> flags to specify richer output formats for
consumption by other tools.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>The <code>deadcode</code> command
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/packages" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">loads</a>,
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/go/parser" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">parses</a>,
and <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/go/types" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">type-checks</a> the specified packages,
then converts them into an
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/ssa" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">intermediate representation</a>
similar to a typical compiler.</p>
<p>It then uses an algorithm called
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/callgraph/rta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Rapid Type Analysis</a> (RTA)
to build up the set of functions that are reachable,
which is initially just the entry points of each <code>main</code> package:
the <code>main</code> function,
and the package initializer function,
which assigns global variables and calls functions named <code>init</code>.</p>
<p>RTA looks at the statements in the body of each reachable function to
gather three kinds of information: the set of functions it calls directly;
the set of dynamic calls it makes through interface methods;
and the set of types it converts to an interface.</p>
<p>Direct function calls are easy: we just add the callee to the set of
reachable functions, and if it’s the first time we’ve encountered the
callee, we inspect its function body the same way we did for main.</p>
<p>Dynamic calls through interface methods are trickier, because we don’t
know the set of types that implement the interface. We don’t want
to assume that every possible method in the program whose type matches
is a possible target for the call, because some of those types may
be instantiated only from dead code! That’s why we gather the set of
types converted to interfaces: the conversion makes each of these
types reachable from <code>main</code>, so that its methods are now possible
targets of dynamic calls.</p>
<p>This leads to a chicken-and-egg situation. As we encounter each new
reachable function, we discover more interface method calls and more
conversions of concrete types to interface types.
But as the cross product of these two sets (interface method calls ×
concrete types) grows ever larger, we discover new reachable
functions.
This class of problems, called “dynamic programming”, can be solved by
(conceptually) making checkmarks in a large two-dimensional table,
adding rows and columns as we go, until there are no more checks to
add. The checkmarks in the final table tells us what is reachable;
the blank cells are the dead code.</p>
<div>
<center>
  <img src="https://go.dev/blog/deadcode-rta.svg" alt="illustration of Rapid Type Analysis"><br>  <i>
   The <code>main</code> function causes <code>Helloer</code> to be
   instantiated, and the <code>g.Greet</code> call<br>
   dispatches to the <code>Greet</code> method of each type instantiated so far.
  </i>
</center>
</div>
<p>Dynamic calls to (non-method) functions are treated similar to
interfaces of a single method.
And calls made <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/reflect#Value.Call" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">using reflection</a>
are considered to reach any method of any type used in an interface
conversion, or any type derivable from one using the <code>reflect</code> package.
But the principle is the same in all cases.</p>
<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>
<p>RTA is a whole-program analysis. That means it always starts from a
main function and works forward: you can’t start from a library
package such as <code>encoding/json</code>.</p>
<p>However, most library packages have tests, and tests have main
functions. We don’t see them because they are generated behind the
scenes of <code>go test</code>, but we can include them in the analysis using the
<code>-test</code> flag.</p>
<p>If this reports that a function in a library package is dead, that’s
a sign that your test coverage could be improved.
For example, this command lists all the functions in <code>encoding/json</code>
that are not reached by any of its tests:</p>
<pre><code>$ deadcode -test -filter=encoding/json encoding/json
encoding/json/decode.go:150:31: unreachable func: UnmarshalFieldError.Error
encoding/json/encode.go:225:28: unreachable func: InvalidUTF8Error.Error
</code></pre>
<p>(The <code>-filter</code> flag restricts the output to packages matching the
regular expression. By default, the tool reports all packages in the
initial module.)</p>
<h2 id="soundness">Soundness</h2>
<p>All static analysis tools
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">necessarily</a>
produce imperfect approximations of the possible dynamic
behaviors of the target program.
A tool’s assumptions and inferences may be “sound”, meaning
conservative but perhaps overly cautious, or “unsound”, meaning
optimistic but not always correct.</p>
<p>The deadcode tool is no exception: it must approximate the set of
targets of dynamic calls through function and interface values or
using reflection.
In this respect, the tool is sound. In other words, if it reports a
function as dead code, it means the function cannot be called even
through these dynamic mechanisms. However the tool may fail to report
some functions that in fact can never be executed.</p>
<p>The deadcode tool must also approximate the set of calls made from
functions not written in Go, which it cannot see.
In this respect, the tool is not sound.
Its analysis is not aware of functions called exclusively from
assembly code, or of the aliasing of functions that arises from
the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/compile#hdr-Compiler_Directives" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>go:linkname</code> directive</a>.
Fortunately both of these features are rarely used outside the Go runtime.</p>
<h2 id="try-it-out">Try it out</h2>
<p>We run <code>deadcode</code> periodically on our projects, especially after
refactoring work, to help identify parts of the program that are no
longer needed.</p>
<p>With the dead code laid to rest, you can focus on eliminating code
whose time has come to an end but that stubbornly remains alive,
continuing to drain your life force. We call such undead functions
“vampire code”!</p>
<p>Please try it out:</p>
<pre><code>$ go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/deadcode@latest
</code></pre>
<p>We’ve found it useful, and we hope you do too.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So, there's this function. It's called a lot. More importantly, all those calls are on the critical path of a key user
interaction. Let's talk about making it fast.</p>
<p>Spoiler: it's a dot product.</p>
<h2 id="some-background-or-skip-to-the-juicy-stuff">Some background (or <a href="#the-target">skip to the juicy stuff</a>)</h2>
<p>At Sourcegraph, we're working on a Code AI tool named <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/cody">Cody</a>. In order for Cody to answer
questions well, we need to give them enough <a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/cheating-is-all-you-need">context</a> to
work with. One of the <a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/whitepaper/cody-context-architecture.pdf">ways we do this</a> is by
leveraging <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings">embeddings</a>.</p>
<p>For our purposes, an <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/embeddings/video-lecture">embedding</a>
is a vector representation of a chunk of text. They are constructed in such a way that semantically similar pieces of
text have more similar vectors. When Cody needs more information to answer a query, we run a similarity search over the
embeddings to fetch a set of related chunks of code and feed those results to Cody to improve the relevance of results.</p>
<p>The piece relevant to this blog post is that similarity metric, which is the function that determines how similar two
vectors are. For similarity search, a common metric is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity">cosine
similarity</a>. However, for normalized vectors (vectors with unit
magnitude), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot product</a> yields a ranking that's <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/clustering/similarity/measuring-similarity">equivalent to cosine
similarity</a>. To run a search,
we calculate the dot product for every embedding in our data set and keep the top results. And since we cannot
start execution of the LLM until we get the necessary context, optimizing this step is crucial.</p>
<p>You might be thinking: why not just use an indexed vector DB? Outside of adding yet another piece of infra that we need
to manage, the construction of an index adds latency and increases resource requirements. Additionally, standard
nearest-neighbor indexes only provide approximate retrieval, which adds another layer of fuzziness compared to a more
easily explainable exhaustive search. Given that, we decided to invest a little in our hand-rolled solution to see how
far we could push it.</p>
<h2 id="the-target">The target</h2>
<p>This is a simple Go implementation of a function that calculates the dot product of two vectors. My goal is to outline
the journey I took to optimize this function, and to share some tools I picked up along the way.</p>

<h2 id="loop-unrolling">Loop unrolling</h2>
<p>Modern CPUs do this thing called <a href="https://chadaustin.me/2009/02/latency-vs-throughput/"><em>instruction pipelining</em></a> where
it can run multiple instructions simultaneously if it finds no data dependencies between them. A data dependency just
means that the input of one instruction depends on the output of another.</p>
<p>In our simple implementation, we have data dependencies between our loop iterations. A couple, in fact. Both <code>i</code> and
<code>sum</code> have a read/write pair each iteration, meaning an iteration cannot start executing until the previous is finished.</p>
<p>A common method of squeezing more out of our CPUs in situations like this is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unrolling"><em>loop
unrolling</em></a>. The basic idea is to rewrite our loop so more of our
relatively-high-latency multiply instructions can execute simultaneously. Additionally, it amortizes the fixed loop
costs (increment and compare) across multiple operations.</p>

<p>In our unrolled code, the dependencies between multiply instructions are removed, enabling the CPU to take more
advantage of pipelining. This increases our throughput by 37% compared to our naive implementation.</p>

<p>Note that we can actually improve this slightly more by twiddling with the number of iterations we unroll. On the
benchmark machine, 8 seemed to be optimal, but on my laptop, 4 performs best. However, the improvement is quite platform
dependent and fairly minimal, so for the rest of the post, I'll stick with an unroll depth of 4 for readability.</p>

<p>In order to keep out-of-bounds slice accesses from being a security vulnerability (like the famous
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed</a> exploit), the go compiler inserts checks before each read. You
can check it out in the <a href="https://go.godbolt.org/z/qT3M7nPGf">generated assembly</a> (look for <code>runtime.panic</code>).</p>

<p>In a hot loop like this, even with modern branch prediction, the additional branches per iteration can add up to a
pretty significant performance penalty. This is especially true in our case because the inserted jumps limit how much we
can take advantage of pipelining.</p>
<p>If we can convince the compiler that these reads can never be out of bounds, it won't insert these runtime checks. This
technique is known as "bounds-checking elimination", and the same patterns can apply to <a href="https://github.com/Shnatsel/bounds-check-cookbook/">languages other than
Go</a>.</p>
<p>In theory, we should be able to do all checks once, outside the loop, and the compiler would be able to determine that
all the slice indexing is safe. However, I couldn't find the right combination of checks to convince the compiler that
what I'm doing is safe. I landed on a combination of asserting the lengths are equal and moving all the bounds checking
to the top of the loop. This was enough to hit nearly the speed of the bounds-check-free version.</p>

<p>Exercise for the reader: why is it significant that we slice like <code>a[i:i+4:i+4]</code> rather than just <code>a[i:i+4]</code>?</p>
<h2 id="quantization">Quantization</h2>
<p>We've improved single-core search throughput by ~50% at this point, but now we've hit a new bottleneck: memory usage.
Our vectors are 1536 dimensions. With 4-byte elements, this comes out to 6KiB per vector, and we generate roughly a million
vectors per GiB of code. That adds up quickly. We had a few customers come to us with some massive monorepos, and we
wanted to reduce our memory usage so we can support those cases more cheaply.</p>
<p>One possible mitigation would be to move the vectors to disk, but loading them from disk at search time can add
<a href="https://colin-scott.github.io/personal_website/research/interactive_latency.html">significant latency</a>, especially on
slow disks. Instead, we chose to compress our vectors with <code>int8</code> quantization.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction">plenty of ways</a> to compress vectors, but we'll be
talking about <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/concept_guides/quantization"><em>integer quantization</em></a>, which is
relatively simple, but effective. The idea is to reduce the precision of the 4-byte <code>float32</code> vector elements by
converting them to 1-byte <code>int8</code>s.</p>
<p>I won't get into exactly <em>how</em> we decide to do the translation between <code>float32</code> and <code>int8</code>, since that's a pretty <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/concept_guides/quantization">deep
topic</a>, but suffice it to say our function now looks
like the following:</p>

<p>This change yields a 4x reduction in memory usage at the cost of some accuracy (which we carefully measured, but is
irrelevant to this blog post).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, re-running the benchmarks shows our search speed regressed a bit from the change. Taking a look at the
generated assembly (with <code>go tool compile -S</code>), there are some new instructions for converting <code>int8</code> to <code>int32</code>, which
might explain the difference. I didn't dig too deep though, since all our performance improvements up to this point
become irrelevant in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="simd">SIMD</h2>
<p>The speed improvements so far were nice, but still not enough for our largest customers. So we started dabbling with
more dramatic approaches.</p>
<p>I always love an excuse to play with SIMD. And this problem seemed like the perfect nail for that hammer.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, SIMD stands for "Single Instruction Multiple Data". Just like it's says, it lets you run an
operation over a bunch of pieces of data with a single instruction. As an example, to add two <code>int32</code> vectors
element-wise, we could add them together one by one with the <code>ADD</code> instruction and, or we can use the <code>VPADDD</code>
instruction to add 64 pairs at a time with the <a href="https://uops.info/html-instr/ADD_01_R32_R32.html">same</a>
<a href="https://uops.info/html-instr/VPADDD_YMM_YMM_M256.html">latency</a> (depending on the architecture).</p>
<p>We have a problem though. Go does not expose SIMD intrinsics like
<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html">C</a> or
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/core/simd/index.html">Rust</a>. We have two options here: write it in C and use Cgo, or
write it by hand for Go's assembler. I try hard to avoid Cgo whenever possible for <a href="https://dave.cheney.net/2016/01/18/cgo-is-not-go">many reasons that are not at all
original</a>, but one of those reasons is that Cgo imposes a performance
penalty, and performance of this snippet is paramount. Also, getting my hands dirty with some assembly sounds fun, so
that's what I'm going to do.</p>
<p>I want this routine to be reasonably portable, so I'm going to restrict myself to only AVX2 instructions, which are
supported on most <code>x86_64</code> server CPUs these days. We can use <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@3ac2170c6523dd074835919a1804f197cf86e451/-/blob/internal/embeddings/dot_amd64.go?L17-21">runtime feature
detection</a>
to fall back to a slower option in pure Go.</p>

<p>The core loop of the implementation depends on three main instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/pmovsx"><code>VPMOVSXBW</code></a>, which loads <code>int8</code>s into a vector <code>int16</code>s</li>
<li><a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/pmaddwd"><code>VPMADDWD</code></a>, which multiplies two <code>int16</code> vectors element-wise, then adds
fuzzy stack.
together adjacent pairs to produce a vector of <code>int32</code>s</li>
<li><a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/paddb:paddw:paddd:paddq"><code>VPADDD</code></a>, which accumulates the resulting <code>int32</code> vector
into our running sum</li>
</ul>
<p><code>VPMADDWD</code> is a real heavy lifter here. By combining the multiply and add steps into one, not only does it save
instructions, it also helps us avoid overflow issues by simultaneously widening the result to an <code>int32</code>.</p>
<p>Let's see what this earned us.</p>

<p>Woah, that's a 530% increase in throughput from our previous best! SIMD for the win 🚀</p>
<p>Now, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. Hand-writing assembly in Go is weird. It uses a <a href="https://go.dev/doc/asm">custom
assembler</a>, which means that its assembly language looks just-different-enough-to-be-confusing
compared to the assembly snippets you usually find online. It has some weird quirks like <a href="https://www.quasilyte.dev/blog/post/go-asm-complementary-reference/#operands-order">changing the order of
instruction operands</a> or <a href="https://www.quasilyte.dev/blog/post/go-asm-complementary-reference/#mnemonics">using
different names for instructions</a>. Some
instructions don't even <em>have</em> names in the go assembler and can only be used via their <a href="https://go.dev/doc/asm#unsupported_opcodes">binary
encoding</a>. Shameless plug: I found
<a href="https://sourcegraph.com/search">sourcegraph.com</a> invaluable for finding examples of Go assembly to draw from.</p>
<p>That said, compared to Cgo, there are some nice benefits. Debugging still works well, the assembly can be stepped
through, and registers can be inspected using <code>delve</code>. There are no extra build steps (a C toolchain doesn't need to be
set up). It's easy to set up a pure-Go fallback so cross-compilation still works. Common problems are caught by <code>go vet</code>.</p>
<h2 id="simdbut-bigger">SIMD...but bigger</h2>
<p>Previously, we limited ourselves to AVX2, but what if we <em>didn't</em>? The VNNI extension to AVX-512 added the
<a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/vpdpbusd"><code>VPDPBUSD</code></a> instruction, which computes the dot product on <code>int8</code> vectors
rather than <code>int16</code>s. This means we can process four times as many elements in a single instruction because we don't
have to convert to <code>int16</code> first and our vector width doubles with AVX-512!</p>
<p>The only problem is that the instruction requires one vector to be signed bytes, and the other to be <em>unsigned</em> bytes.
Both of our vectors are signed. We can employ <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onednn/developer-guide-reference/2023-0/nuances-of-int8-computations.html#DOXID-DEV-GUIDE-INT8-COMPUTATIONS-1DG-I8-COMP-S12">a trick from Intel's developer
guide</a>
to help us out. Given two <code>int8</code> elements, <code>a<sub>n</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>n</sub></code>, we do the
element-wise calculation as <code>a<sub>n</sub>* (b<sub>n</sub> + 128) - a<sub>n</sub> * 128</code>. The
<code>a<sub>n</sub> * 128</code> term is the overshoot from adding 128 to bump <code>b<sub>n</sub></code> into <code>u8</code>
range. We keep track of that separately and subtract it at the end. Each of the operations in that expression can be
vectorized.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>Well, I'm pretty happy with an 9.3x increase in throughput and a 4x reduction in memory usage, so I'll probably leave it
here.</p>
<p>The real life answer here is probably "use an index". There is a ton of good work out there focused on making nearest
neighbor search fast, and there are plenty of batteries-included vector DBs that make it pretty easy to deploy.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, if you want some fun food for thought, a colleague of mine built a proof-of-concept <a href="https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/compare/simd-post-gpu-embeddings~3...simd-post-gpu-embeddings">dot product on the

<p>It's hard to escape the fact that American trucks and SUVs have been on a steroid-infused diet for the last few years. The trend was all too apparent at the last auto show we went to—at Chicago in 2020, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/02/supersized-trucks-and-suvs-seem-here-to-stay-unlike-the-auto-show/">I felt physically threatened just standing next</a> to some of the products on display by GMC and its competitors. Intuitively, the supersized hood heights on these pickups seem more dangerous to vulnerable road users, but now there's hard data to support that.</p>
<p>It hasn't been a great few years to be a pedestrian in the United States. These most vulnerable road users started <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/03/us-pedestrian-deaths-rose-sharply-in-the-first-half-of-2020/">being killed by drivers more frequently in 2020</a>, and while some states were able to reverse that trend, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/06/pedestrian-deaths-rose-in-2022-some-states-more-dangerous-than-others/">others went the other way</a>, making 2022—the last year for which there is full data—the most deadly year on record for US pedestrians.</p>
<p>The problem has multiple causes. For decades, urban planners have prioritized car traffic above everything else, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/how-cities-can-stem-the-tide-of-pedestrian-deaths-from-large-cars-and-suvs/">and our built environment favors speeding vehicles</a> at the cost of people trying to cross roads or cycle. But it's not all just the fault of those planners, as the vehicles we drive play a large role, too.</p>
<p>Some of that is the switch from sedans to crossovers, SUVs, and pickup trucks. Data from the 1990s found that a pedestrian hit by a light truck was two to three times more likely to be killed, with another study finding that light trucks were twice as likely to injure a pedestrian than a car, especially at low speed.</p>
<p>Now, a new study published in the journal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012224000017">Economics of Transportation</a> has analyzed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's crash data from 2016–2021, looking at crashes involving one vehicle and one pedestrian. The author, Justin Tyndall at the University of Hawai'i, matched NHTSA's crash reporting sampling system data for those years to vehicle specifications where the vehicle's VIN was included in the CRSS data.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Tyndall's data set started with 13,783 single-vehicle, single-pedestrian crashes, then filtered out those instances where there was no VIN recorded, except if the report included make and model. He also removed entries that did not record other important variables, such as vehicle speed, leaving a sample size of 3,375 crashes.</p>
<p>To make sure the smaller data set was still representative, Tyndall looked at the full data set as well as the final sample. He found "that average crash characteristics are similar across the two samples, suggesting that the reduced sample is broadly representative of the original data set," although he notes that 6.7 percent of crashes in the large set resulted in a pedestrian death, while 9.1 percent of crashes in the smaller, final sample were fatal for the pedestrian.</p>
<h2>Pickups and SUVs are more dangerous to pedestrians</h2>
<p>There were 1,779 unique vehicles (as determined by make, model, and model year) in the data set. Pickups and full-size SUVs had significantly taller hoods than the average car, at 28 percent and 27 percent, respectively. Minivans weren't much better, at 24 percent taller than the hood on an average sedan. Even compact SUVs—also known as crossovers—were 19 percent taller. Pickups and full-size SUVs were also much heavier than the average vehicle: 55 percent for SUVs and 51 percent for pickup trucks.</p>
<p>Tyndall also notes that while the data set only spans six years, over that time, "the median front-end height increased by 5 percent," while weight increased slightly less (3 percent), and the chance that the vehicle was a light truck rather than a car went up by 11 percent.</p>
<p>Of the 3,375 crashes, 308 saw the vehicle kill the pedestrian. When examined by vehicle type, vans proved to be the least dangerous to pedestrians, with a 6.6 percent chance of death. Cars were a bit worse—8.5 percent of pedestrians hit by a sedan or hatchback were killed. Compact SUVs were roughly the same as cars at 8.8 percent.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>What if Serverless Meant No Backend Servers?</h2><p>By now, everyone knows that serverless doesn't actually mean without servers; it just means using someone else's servers. But what if it really meant no servers at all? What if you could run your code entirely without any servers? You might be thinking, "That's just desktop applications," but that's not what I'm referring to. What if we could run a traditional web app, composed of frontend code, that talks to an express-like server and saves data in a database, all without any servers? No backend servers, no containers, no virtual machines, nothing. Just code, a browser (well, and a place to serve our static files from, which technically is a server).</p><p>I'll call this the ServerFree™ architecture.</p><h3 id="tldr">TL;DR </h3><p>This article demonstrates how to build a web application that is packaged to run in the browser, including the database.<!-- --> <!-- -->The frontend code is build as usual, the backend is packaged and runs in a web worker and for the database we use <a href="https://sqlite.org/wasm/doc/trunk/index.md">SQLite compiled to WebAssembly</a>.</p><p>The code for the demo app is available on <a href="https://github.com/subzerocloud/my-way-track">github</a>.</p><p>A live version is running on <a href="https://my-way-track.vercel.app/">https://my-way-track.vercel.app/</a>.</p><p>The article is split into a few sections.

"I know, I'll engage in some content marketing... but what do I need for that? Oh, a cool demo project!" And just like that, I found a way to spend a month <s>doing content marketing</s> writing code.</p><p>Lately, it seems like most developer-focused content leans more towards spam than substance. You see titles like "Build &lt;thing&gt; in 5 minutes" or "Create a &lt;fang&gt; clone in 1 hour (with our SaaS)," but once you scratch the surface, they often turn out to be another trivial todo/blog/chat app that nobody really uses.</p><p>I wanted to create something different, something genuinely useful. While seeking inspiration on Hacker News, I stumbled upon <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37792507">Show HN: A job application tracker with company reviews, recruiter autoresponder</a>.

So, let's do some UI customization. You'll see that the backend functionality is so powerful that we never have to touch the backend code (<code>server.ts</code>, which is like 200 LOC).</p><h4 id="better-layout">Better Layout </h4><p>The first thing we'll change is the layout.

Simple HTML with some Tailwind classes gets the job done.</p></li><li><p>On the List page, we have some very light formatting logic for a few fields. The key component here is the <code>OpportunityFilter</code>. While it primarily consists of declarative JSX code and lacks intricate business logic, the filtering capabilities it enables are remarkably powerful and flexible. This showcases the thoughtful design of <a href="https://marmelab.com/react-admin/">React Admin</a>. By defining our <code>Datagrid</code> and <code>Filter</code> components, the library orchestrates the interactions between lists, filters, and the backend API, eliminating the need for explicit logic like "when I click this button, call this API and update the list with the results."</p></li><li><p>Lastly, I want to highlight that we've implemented complex flows, especially for filtering, without needing to add any custom backend endpoints to handle the complexity.</p></li></ul><p>If you've looked at the <a href="https://github.com/subzerocloud/my-way-track/commit/dddd42e52f7eac47d9ee191dbd034dd7a990ba19">commit</a> following the one mentioned earlier, you might have noticed a small change in <code>server.ts</code>. At first glance, you might think, "Aha, they did have to change the backend code." However, this particular case highlights the flexibility of SubZero rather than its limitations. Let me explain.</p><p>In our database schema, we used a column named <code>stage_ids</code> to hold the IDs of completed stages for each opportunity. In the filtering component, we aimed to provide a way to display opportunities that completed a specific stage. The SubZero REST API, which follows the PostgREST specs, has a filtering operator called <code>cs</code>. This operator, corresponding to PostgreSQL's <code>@&gt;</code> operator, checks if a value is contained in an array. Our database, however, uses SQLite, which doesn't natively support this operator. Many people overlook SQLite, thinking it lacks certain features they need. But SQLite is highly extensible, allowing the addition of custom functions. We added a custom function to SQLite that implements the <code>@&gt;</code> operator (the <code>cs</code> function). Now, we can effectively use this in our filtering. Neat, right?</p><h4 id="dashboard">The Dashboard </h4><p>At this stage, we have a fully functional app, but the Dashboard displays only some generic information about the number of tables and columns in our schema. Let's enhance it to show more relevant data, such as "Open Opportunities," "Average Progress / Application," and "Average Days Since Application."</p><p>Here is the commit that accomplishes this: <a href="https://github.com/subzerocloud/my-way-track/commit/7192e514a77c12df0f5b67f3c6a878688fb48fd7">Custom Dashboard</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://subzero.cloud/blog/serverfree-architecture/custom-dashboard.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>While you might expect some complex rendering logic for those visually appealing panels and charts, you'll be pleasantly surprised to find that the code is quite simple, thanks to <a href="https://www.tremor.so/">Tremor</a>. All you need is the data to display, and here, the power of the SubZero REST API shines through. Once again, we did not need to write any custom backend code to achieve this.</p><p>Take a look at these beauties in <code>Dashboard.tsx</code>:</p><pre><code><span>// get the number of applications per week</span><span></span>

</code></pre><h3 id="mvp-v1">MVP V1 (Small Detour with Turso DB) </h3><p>At this point, we have a nice-looking, fully functional app, complete with a backend server, a database, and a frontend. It would be a shame not to explore how we can package this classic architecture into a single deployable unit for production. So, let's do that.</p><h4 id="docker-image">The docker image </h4><p>Deploying this to production is a matter of building the image:</p><pre><code><span>docker build -t my-way-track .</span>
</code></pre><p>seeding the database:</p><pre><code><span>(cd db &amp;&amp; sqlite3 production.db &lt; init.sql)</span>
</code></pre><p>and running the container:</p><pre><code><span>docker run --rm \</span>
<span>-p 3000:3000 \</span>
<span>-e JWT_SECRET="&lt;LONG_JWT_SECRET_GOES_HERE&gt;" \</span>
<span>-v "$(pwd)/db/production.db:/app/app.db" \</span>
<span>my-way-track</span>
</code></pre><p>Now, the application can be accessed at http://localhost:3000, but logging in isn't possible because the test user, which was being created by the SubZero development tooling, is no longer there. Therefore, we need to create a user.</p><p>First, we'll need an <code>env.production</code> file to store some configuration settings for the SubZero CLI, enabling it to connect to the production instance of the app.</p><p>Save the following in <code>env.production</code>:</p><pre><code><span>API_EXTERNAL_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth</span>
<span>GOTRUE_JWT_SECRET=&lt;LONG_JWT_SECRET_GOES_HERE&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>Now we can use the cli to create the user:</p><pre><code><span>CONFIG_PATH=.env.production npx auth-cli users create</span>
</code></pre><p>Check the user was created:</p><pre><code><span>CONFIG_PATH=.env.production npx auth-cli users list</span>
</code></pre><h4 id="turso-db">Meet Turso DB </h4><p>We now have the Docker image and can deploy it anywhere we want, but there's still one aspect that's not ideal: the database. The SQLite database file needs to live outside the container to persist data between container restarts. While services running our container might offer vendor-specific ways to persist files, this isn't ideal. Wouldn't it be nice if we could access SQLite with a connection string, similar to PostgreSQL or MySQL? Thanks to <a href="https://turso.tech/">Turso DB</a>, this is now possible. With this service/technology, we've solved our SQLite database persistence and backup issues in one stroke.</p><p>The SubZero library has built-in support for Turso DB, so all we need to do is replace the better-sqlite3 client with the Turso DB client, and we're set. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/subzerocloud/my-way-track/commit/1ed38e9e724f91f135d9df404ad090bd1e9dedd3">commit</a> that implements this change.</p><p>Sign up for a free account at <a href="https://turso.tech/">https://turso.tech/</a> and create a database. Use <a href="https://docs.turso.tech/quickstart">this walkthrough</a> to set up the Turso CLI and create a database.</p><p>Once the database is created (in the commands below, we've named the database <code>mywaytrack</code>), seed it like this:</p><pre><code><span>turso db shell mywaytrack &lt; db/include/schema.sql</span>
</code></pre><p>Get the connection string for the database:</p><pre><code><span>turso db show mywaytrack</span>
</code></pre><p>Get the token for the database:</p><pre><code><span>turso db tokens create mywaytrack</span>
</code></pre><p>Rebuild the docker image:</p><pre><code><span>docker build -t my-way-track .</span>
</code></pre><p>Run the container:</p><pre><code><span>docker run --rm \</span>
<span>-p 3000:3000 \</span>
<span>-e JWT_SECRET="&lt;LONG_JWT_SECRET_HERE&gt;" \</span>
<span>-e DB_URI="&lt;turso_connection_string_here&gt;" \</span>
<span>-e TURSO_TOKEN="&lt;TURSO_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE&gt;" \</span>
<span>my-way-track</span>
</code></pre><p>Create the user:</p><pre><code><span>CONFIG_PATH=.env.production npx auth-cli users create</span>
</code></pre><p>Now we have a way of deploying and restarting our app without losing the data in our SQLite database.</p><h3 id="serverfree">Converting to ServerFree Architecture (The Fun Part) </h3><p>Here's how all the components fit together and what we are aiming to achieve:</p><figure><img src="https://subzero.cloud/blog/serverfree-architecture/diagram.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Below, I'll go through each component, explaining how it works, the reasoning behind it, and the challenges I faced.</p><p>Most of the changes were implemented in this <a href="https://github.com/subzerocloud/my-way-track/commit/d0f97e70a9879f05edd8c79fb1ed433c17e491f7">commit</a>.</p><h4 id="sqlite-wasm">SQLite Compiled to WebAssembly </h4><p>If, like me, you spend a lot of time on HackerNews, you've probably heard about the <a href="https://sqlite.org/wasm/doc/trunk/index.md">version of SQLite</a> compiled to WebAssembly. Though I've never seen it used in a real-world application, it's a core component of our ServerFree architecture. After all, everyone needs a database, right?</p><p>For storage, it offers options like localStorage and sessionStorage, which aren't very useful for our case — too small and volatile for my taste. However, it also supports using the Origin-Private FileSystem (OPFS). This is a relatively new development in the browser world, yet it's already supported by all major browsers.</p><p>There is a small catch, though, when using OPFS with SQLite: the code interacting with the database must run in a Web Worker. Additionally, when the worker script is fetched from the server, you need to set these headers:</p><pre><code><span>Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp</span>
<span>Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin</span>
</code></pre><h4 id="web-worker">The Web Worker </h4><p>We need to run our backend code in a web worker, primarily because we're using SQLite with OPFS. Fortunately, this requirement works in our favor, as it allows the backend code to run on a separate thread, preventing the UI thread from being blocked.</p><p>To make our code compatible with a WebWorker environment, we mostly needed to eliminate dependencies on NodeJS-specific APIs and replace them with browser-compatible ones.</p><p>The server code was using Express, primarily for routing and the HTTP server – functions that rely on NodeJS-specific APIs. To address this, I replaced Express with <a href="https://github.com/kwhitley/itty-router">itty-router</a>. Itty-router provides similar routing/middleware functionality but is browser-compatible.</p><p>I kept <a href="https://github.com/subzerocloud/my-way-track/blob/main/src/server.ts">src/server.ts</a> worker-agnostic, only exporting the <code>router</code> and <code>init</code> function. From there, the worker just needs to call</p><pre><code><span>await</span><span> router</span><span>.</span><span>handle</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>,</span><span> response</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>throw</span><span> e</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>This approach keeps things nicely separated, allowing you to essentially copy and paste the worker code into your own project, along with your custom server logic.</p><h4 id="service-worker">The Service Worker </h4><p>The Service Worker is a lesser-known browser feature, and it was new to me before this project. Introduced in 2015, Service Workers essentially act as a proxy between the browser and the network. They can intercept requests and respond with cached data, enabling developers to build offline-first applications. However, they differ significantly from Web Workers, particularly in their lifecycle, and they're not intended for running application code (as the browser can terminate them at any time, causing loss of state). For a deeper dive into the stages of a Service Worker, check out <a href="https://web.dev/articles/service-worker-lifecycle">this article</a>.</p><p>Our interest lies in their ability to intercept requests made by the UI to the backend, allowing us to handle them in the worker. Initially, I tried running the entire backend in the Service Worker (not yet aware that the browser could terminate it anytime). However, I encountered a limitation: a specific OPFS capability was not available in the Service Worker environment. This meant I could not use SQLite from the Service Worker.</p><p>In the diagram above, you see a direct arrow between the Service Worker and the Web Worker. However, enabling direct communication between them was challenging due to the unpredictable start/stop nature of the Service Worker. The MessageChannel setup between them was lost randomly. Ultimately, a more reliable solution was to use the main thread as a proxy between the Service Worker and the Web Worker.</p><h4 id="main-thread">The Main Thread </h4><p>In the main thread (UI), I eliminated the code related to authentication. If you think about it, in this context, you authenticate when you log in to your computer. Although you are navigating to a web page, you are actually interacting with files on your computer, which is no different than interacting with a document or an Excel file.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion </h3><p>I believe this architecture holds a lot of potential, and I'm eager to see what people will create with it. There are many use cases where this architecture is particularly advantageous, especially when customer data is distinct and there's no need to share it between users.</p><p>Here are some key benefits of this architecture:</p><ul><li><p><strong>No Backend Servers</strong>: This is the most apparent benefit. You can provide a service at the cost of hosting a static website, eliminating concerns about scaling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Privacy</strong>: Data is stored on the user's computer and never reaches your servers. This means less worry about complying with GDPR, CCPA, etc. One minor drawback is that the user needs to use the same computer/browser, but this can be addressed by providing a way to <a href="https://sqlite.org/wasm/doc/trunk/api-worker1.md#method-export">export/import</a> the database.</p></li><li><p><strong>Security</strong>: For sensitive data, such as medical records or financial information, you don't need to worry (as much) about encryption, data leaks, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Offload Work from the Backend</strong>: With tools like <a href="https://electric-sql.com/">Electric</a>, you can sync part of the database to the client and route some requests/queries to be handled by the browser, which would otherwise burden the backend server. This can be achieved without major changes to your frontend code.</p></li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

                                        <p>The United Airlines CEO says he is “disappointed” in ongoing manufacturing problems at Boeing that have led to the grounding of dozens of United jetliners, and the airline will consider alternatives to buying a future, larger version of the Boeing 737 Max.</p><p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said Tuesday that Boeing needs “real action” to restore its previous reputation for quality.</p><p>Kirby’s comments came one day after United disclosed that it <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/united-airlines-profit-outlook-loss-e2418343cf42b1efa40b4eadf6d89fec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expects to lose money</a></span> in the first three months of this year because of the grounding of its Boeing 737 Max 9 jets. </p>
    

<p>United has 79 of those planes, which federal regulators grounded more than two weeks ago after a panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines Max 9 in midflight, leaving a gaping hole in the plane. Investigators are probing whether bolts that help hold the panel in place were missing or broke off.</p>



<p>Kirby said on CNBC that he believes that the Max 9s could be cleared to fly again soon, “but I’m disappointed that the manufacturing challenges do keep happening at Boeing.”</p>
    
<p>At times over the past few years, manufacturing flaws have held up deliveries of Max jets and a larger Boeing plane, the 787. Last year, United received 24 fewer Boeing aircraft than it expected.</p><p>United has a standing order for Max 10 jets, a larger version of the Max line. However, that model and a smaller one, the Max 7, are years behind schedule for being certified by the Federal Aviation Administration. The grounding of the Max 9 jets is likely to further complicate Boeing’s drive to get the new models approved.</p><p>Kirby said the Max 10 is at least five years behind schedule and could be pushed further into the future.</p>
    

<p>“I think this is the straw — the Max 9 grounding — is probably the straw that broke the camel’s back for us,” he told CNBC. “We’re going to at least build a plan that doesn’t have the Max 10 in it.”</p><p>Kirby wasn’t specific about what planes the airline could acquire instead of the Max 10, but he noted that there is only one other global manufacturer of such large planes — Boeing’s European rival Airbus.</p><p>Doing without the Max 10 probably means United won’t grow as fast as it had hoped, Kirby added. </p><p>Stan Deal, CEO of Boeing’s commercial airplanes division, apologized for the Max 9 grounding and said the company is making changes.</p><p>“We have let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers,” Deal said in a prepared statement. “We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance.”</p><p>Shares of United Airlines Holdings Inc. rose 6% Tuesday. After the end of regular trading Monday, the company said it would lose up to 85 cents per share in the first quarter but earn $9 to $11 per share for all of 2024.</p><p>Shares of The Boeing Co. fell less than 1%. </p>

<div><p>🖥️</p><p><i><em>404 Media is reported and written by humans for humans. Sign up above for free access to this article.</em></i></p></div><p>The NSA has finally released a treasure trove of documents about the brief Furby panic of 1998 and 1999 at America’s top spy agency, in which it banned the toy from its offices as a potential spy device, discussed the toy’s ability to “learn” using an “artificial intelligent chip onboard” on an internal listserv, and ultimately was embarrassed by attention from the press after an employee leaked news of the ban to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1999/01/13/a-toy-story-of-hairy-espionage/edb69b8a-1b41-47f8-8166-b8839cd637f3/?ref=404media.co"><em><u>The Washington Post</u></em></a>.</p><p>The NSA’s interest in and concern with the spying capabilities of the Furby—the iconic furry robot toy—has been <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nasa-furby-ban/?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">documented</a> over the years by various news outlets, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25QHy50nyZo&amp;ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">YouTube channels</a>, and the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/media/19696?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (which banned Furby operation during takeoff and landing). But previous write-ups rely on a brief news story in the <em>Washington Post</em> from January 13, 1999 called “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1999/01/13/a-toy-story-of-hairy-espionage/edb69b8a-1b41-47f8-8166-b8839cd637f3/?ref=404media.co"><u>A TOY STORY OF HAIRY ESPIONAGE</u></a>,” which noted that Furby had been banned from the NSA’s offices in Maryland in part because they were worried that NSA employees would discuss classified information to the Furby, which could learn from it and would possibly repeat what it’d heard at a later date.</p><p>kotaKat, a "snarky internet bobcat" whose interests include furry fandom and infosec, filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the NSA a year ago because he was “bored in a group chat one night” and was discussing the episode, he told me. “I myself kept hearing about the stories about the ‘Furby Alert’ (turns out it's actually the ‘Furbie Alert’) but nobody ever actually provided hardline evidence of it. I just wanted to know what the policy memo on the NSA Intranet was.”</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I have acquired the fabled NSA "FURBIE ALERT" memo.</p><p>I have a significant amount of documentation that came back on an FOIA and I'll be scanning it in the coming days.</p><p>Stay tuned. <a href="https://t.co/Fyo04dm4Oo?ref=404media.co">pic.twitter.com/Fyo04dm4Oo</a></p></div>— (da)kota/the/Kæt (@dakotathekat) <a href="https://twitter.com/dakotathekat/status/1749567436142047361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=404media.co">January 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>On Monday, kotaKat got a manilla envelope of documents in the mail from the NSA mailed to their house with more than 60 pages of documents, including the original listserv thread, employee discussions about whether the Furby was actually a security threat, an internal memo trying to do damage control over the <em>Washington Post</em> story, and an exhaustive list of all of the media outlets that originally wrote about the ban. As a public service, they quickly scanned the documents and <a href="https://archive.org/details/nsa-furby-memo/NSA%20Furby%20Memo%20-%20Memoranda/page/n5/mode/2up" rel="noreferrer">published them on the Internet Archive</a>: “you can't type fast enough to explain the level of shitpost request you made a year ago to the <em>Department of Defense</em> and suddenly get 60+ pages in a manilla envelope sent straight to your doorstep.”</p>

<p>Great news for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> users, after months of testing, Mozilla released today a <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/install-firefox-linux#w_install-firefox-deb-package-for-debian-based-distributions">new package for Firefox on Linux</a> (specifically on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian">Debian</a>, and any Debian-based distribution). If you’ve heard about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>, which is known for its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open-source </a>software and an alternative to traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">operating systems</a> (OS), and are curious to learn more, here are four reasons why you should give our new <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/install-firefox-linux#w_install-firefox-deb-package-for-debian-based-distributions">Firefox on Linux package</a> a try.</p>



<h2>1. Adaptable to fit your needs</h2>



<p>Browsers are complex applications that support many scenarios in people’s daily lives and we’ve been working on improving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(software_development)">sandbox implementations</a>. This is why, while Firefox gets fully compatible with Snap and Flatpak, we want to offer a native package too.</p>



<p>Firefox is available in several official formats on Linux including the <a href="http://w_install-firefox-from-mozilla-builds/">Mozilla .tar.bz2 builds</a> and sandboxed packages like <a href="https://canonical.com/blog/firefox-quantum-snap-now-available-on-linux-based-devices">Snap</a> and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/75.0/releasenotes/">Flatpak</a>.</p>



<h2>2. 100% built by Mozilla</h2>



<p>We are grateful for those who choose <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/install-firefox-linux#w_install-firefox-deb-package-for-debian-based-distributions">Firefox on Linux</a>, making it a popular option and for many, their default browser. Previously, Firefox .deb packages needed the help of people and organizations (depending on the linux <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution">distribution</a>) outside of Mozilla. With this new <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/install-firefox-linux#w_install-firefox-deb-package-for-debian-based-distributions">package</a>, we offer Firefox assembled from its source code, without any modifications, built and supported by Mozilla. 💪</p>



<h2>3. Better performance&nbsp;</h2>



<p>For more than 25 years, Mozilla has built a reputation for building free and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/">open-source web browsers</a>. Because the Firefox browser is open-source, we know Firefox inside and out, including how to get the best from it. For example, we built Firefox with advanced compiler-based optimizations for better performance. Note: If you are using another .deb package, you may or may not get all the optimizations we intended – it depends on the package’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)">maintainers</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>4. Faster updates&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Getting the latest version with features and security fixes is key to having a good experience whenever you use Firefox. Now, our new APT repository is directly connected to the Firefox release process, so you will receive the latest updates whenever we make them available. Tip: you will still need to restart Firefox for the latest version. 😁</p>



<p>Good news: many Linux distributions come with Firefox pre-installed through their package manager and it’s already set as the default browser. 🙌</p>

<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=framework-laptop-16&amp;image=framework_16_1_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=framework-laptop-16&amp;image=framework_16_1_med" alt="Framework Laptop 16"></a></p>
<p>The review embargo has now expired on the Framework Laptop 16, the latest innovative and upgradeable laptop from this company that has made quite a name for itself with modular and user-upgradeable laptop designs for both AMD and Intel. The new Framework Laptop 16 offers even more customizability around the keyboard/touchpad and other options including over using a Radeon RX 7700S graphics module and more. Besides the immense customizability options and upgrades available with the Framework Laptop 16, the new model employs the AMD Ryzen 7040HS processor for even greater performance over the AMD Ryzen 7040U found with the latest Framework 13 model.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=framework-laptop-16&amp;image=framework_16_2_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=framework-laptop-16&amp;image=framework_16_2_med" alt="Framework Laptop 16 keyboard LEDs"></a></p>
<p>Since first testing out <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/framework-laptop">the Framework Laptop in 2021</a> and then last November reviewing <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/framework-13-amd">the Framework 13 with AMD Ryzen 7040U</a>, I've been a big fan of the Framework Laptops. When first announced years ago the Framework Laptop sounded great in theory but ultimately questionable about how well it would work out in practice and whether they'd be able to firmly deliver and stand the test of time. Well, they've been nailing it with execution and continuing to prove themselves with each new iteration and making their upgradeable products all the more exciting and driving greater interest with each succeeding launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=framework-laptop-16&amp;image=framework_16_3_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=framework-laptop-16&amp;image=framework_16_3_med" alt="Framework Laptop 16 laptop box"></a></p>
<p>In not reading too much on the Framework Laptop 16 prior to its arrival, I was blown away by the additional customizability available with this 16-inch laptop thanks to the larger form factor while the motherboard, I/O ports, and other upgradeable options with prior Framework Laptops remain available. Framework also continues to make the design files open-source and leverage other open aspects of their upgradeable laptop designs to really offer a compelling solution. Plus, as with the Framework 13, there is nice Linux support. With the prior model there was initially a Linux hiccup causing the BIOS needing an update for the AMD graphics support, but the Framework 16 was in good shape. If you are running a modern Linux distribution with an up-to-date Mesa, Linux kernel, and AMDGPU firmware, you should be good to go.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=framework-laptop-16&amp;image=framework_16_4_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=framework-laptop-16&amp;image=framework_16_4_med" alt="Framework Laptop 16 parts"></a></p>
<p>The Framework Laptop 16 is a bit heavier -- fully kitted out it's a bit heavy, one of my few complains with the new unit. Plus in maintaining the slimness of the overall laptop if wanting to use the Gigabit Ethernet port it sticks out from the side of the laptop. The weight (with the discrete graphics module) and breaking the sleak design when using certain I/O ports / upgrades are really the only critiques I've had with the unit in my testing thus far.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=framework-laptop-16&amp;image=framework_16_5_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=framework-laptop-16&amp;image=framework_16_5_med" alt="Framework Laptop 16 bottom"></a></p>
<p>Pricing on the Framework Laptop 16 starts at $1399 USD for the DIY model or $1699 USD for the pre-built version with Microsoft Windows pre-installed. It's more expensive than the Framework 13 as going for the higher-end Ryzen 7040HS processor plus the additional customizability options thanks to the larger design.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=framework-laptop-16&amp;image=framework_16_6_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=framework-laptop-16&amp;image=framework_16_6_med" alt="Framework Laptop 16 I/O"></a></p>
<p>The base pricing on the Framework Laptop 16 is with the Ryzen 7 7840HS while the Ryzen 9 7940HS is available (5.1GHz vs. 5.2GHz maximum boost frequency) for an additional $200, there are DDR5-5600 memory options from 8GB up to 64GB (all replaceable DIMMs), up to two NVMe SSDs, the optional graphics module for enjoying Radeon RX 7700S discrete graphics rather than the integrated RX 780M graphics, various input module options from an RGB macropad to numpad, and the various expansion cards.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=framework-laptop-16&amp;image=framework_16_7_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=framework-laptop-16&amp;image=framework_16_7_med" alt="Framework Laptop 16 assembly"></a></p>
<p>Another great feature worth pointing out with the Framework Laptop 16 is the display's 165Hz refresh rate that also supports VRR and FreeSync. The display is very nice with the Framework Laptop 16 with a 1500:1 contrast ratio and 500nit brightness.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=framework-laptop-16&amp;image=framework_16_8_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=framework-laptop-16&amp;image=framework_16_8_med" alt="Framework Laptop 16 keyboard"></a></p></div>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We propose a novel definition of life in terms of which its emergence in the universe is expected, and its ever-creative open-ended evolution is entailed by no law. Living organisms are Kantian Wholes that achieve Catalytic Closure, Constraint Closure, and Spatial Closure. We here unite for the first time two established mathematical theories, namely Collectively Autocatalytic Sets and the Theory of the Adjacent Possible. The former establishes that a first-order phase transition to molecular reproduction is expected in the chemical evolution of the universe where the diversity and complexity of molecules increases; the latter posits that, under loose hypotheses, if the system starts with a small number of beginning molecules, each of which can combine with copies of itself or other molecules to make new molecules, over time the number of kinds of molecules increases slowly but then explodes upward hyperbolically. Together these theories imply that life is expected as a phase transition in the evolving universe. The familiar distinction between software and hardware loses its meaning in living cells. We propose new ways to study the phylogeny of metabolisms, new astronomical ways to search for life on exoplanets, new experiments to seek the emergence of the most rudimentary life, and the hint of a coherent testable pathway to prokaryotes with template replication and coding.

As a cyclist, I had occasionally thought of using more or fewer wheels, but it was only when choosing a grandson’s gift that I got seriously lost in contemplation of a gleaming chrome unicycle. My wife said “buy the bloody” thing, which I did on the whim of the moment. After months of practice at home, I graduated to back streets, a small paved park, and finally town roads. I couldn’t avoid being noticed; in turn, I couldn’t avoid observing the form that notice took. Because at the time there were no other unicyclists in the area, such sightings would have been exceptional, yet I soon found that the responses to them were stereotyped and predictable. I realised that this indicated an underlying biological phenomenon and set about its study.</p></div><div id="sec-a.d.b"><h2 id="sec-a.d.btitle">Methods</h2><p>As I had no idea what the phenomenon was, my reservoir of multipurpose preconceptions could not provide a testable hypothesis; instead, I needed simply to observe neutrally the response to the unusual stimulus of unicycling administered reproducibly. I therefore wore the same bland tracksuit, trainers, and facial demeanour, and I rode “neutrally” with no attempt to entertain.</p><p>I closely observed for just over a year, recording details of the responses and those who made them (estimated age; relationships; and class from dress, speech, and behaviour) as soon as possible. Subsequently, I only recorded new responses or significant variants. I collected written recordings from more than 400 people.</p></div><div id="sec-a.d.c"><h2 id="sec-a.d.ctitle">Results</h2><div id="sec-a.d.c.b"><h3 id="sec-a.d.c.btitle">Observed responses</h3><p>Less than 5% of people—mostly elderly men, women, and teenage girls—showed no reaction. About 1-2% of people expressed anger, distaste, or fear of collision, mostly elderly women and some men walking with sticks.</p><p>More than 90% of people showed a physical response—from an exaggerated stare or acknowledgment to a wave, nod, smile, or a show of mock surprise and fear, which reflected any remarks made.</p><p>Almost 50% of those encountered, more often men than women, responded verbally (box). The sex difference in the type of response was striking. Around 95% of responses from women praised, encouraged, or showed concern, and women made few comic or snide remarks. In contrast, only 25% of the comments made by men indicated praise, appreciation, or neutrality, whereas 75% were attempts at comedy, often snide and proffered combatively as a put-down. Equally striking was their repetitive nature, even though given as if original—almost 66% of these “comic” responses referred to the number of wheels (the most common), the absence of handlebars, or a part having being lost or stolen (box). Less than 25% used less obvious snide humour, but often with stylistic repetition. Some remarks were fired off as if they had been rehearsed on approach. More often, people paused briefly while trying to formulate the response, which was sometimes delivered after I had passed. This pause to find a comic phrase contrasted with the immediacy and apparent spontaneity of the few laudatory remarks made by men and the many made by women. Some of the remarks showed combativeness and envy, such as “bet I could do better than that.”</p><div><h3 id="sec-a.d.c.b.e.atitle">Some verbal responses to unicycling</h3><div><h4 id="sec-a.d.c.b.e.a.btitle">Early years</h4><ul><li><p>Mother to son about 5 years old, “Oh look, why is he riding on one wheel?”</p></li><li><p>Mother to son in pram, “Isn’t that clever.” The boy repeated, “Clever”</p></li><li><p>Father to son about 3 years old, “Look his bike’s got only one wheel . . . wonder what happened to the other”</p></li><li><p>Man to daughter about 4 years old, “Look . . . he’s got no handle bars”</p></li><li><p>Boy of 3-4 years to mother, “Mummy the man’s broken his bike—it’s only got one wheel”</p></li></ul></div><div><h4 id="sec-a.d.c.b.e.a.ctitle">Inquisitive 5-12 year olds</h4><ul><li><p>“Was it hard to learn?”</p></li><li><p>“Where do you buy them?”</p></li><li><p>“How much did it cost?”</p></li><li><p>“Why do you use only one wheel?”</p></li></ul></div><div><h4 id="sec-a.d.c.b.e.a.dtitle">Aggressive boys</h4><ul><li><p>“Do you want to knock him over?” “Yes I bet I could do it”</p></li><li><p>While kicking a football, “Got a good target”</p></li><li><p>Riding at me on bicycle, “Fall off granddad”</p></li><li><p>Sudden loud shouts, then they threw small pebbles</p></li><li><p>Loud noises, then “You’re gonna fall off . . . you’re gonna fall off”</p></li></ul></div><div><h4 id="sec-a.d.c.b.e.a.etitle">Women</h4><ul><li><p>“You make it look so easy”</p></li><li><p>“You should dress up as Santa for the children”</p></li><li><p>“God that must be difficult”</p></li><li><p>“Well done.” </p></li><li><p>“Clever, clever”</p></li><li><p>“Wonderful . . .

Parental comments showed a sex difference—fathers’ remarks were either typical male (wheels, etc) or practical (maintaining balance, etc), whereas mothers’ comments praised and usually informed the children.</p><p>Boys and girls of about 5-12 years usually showed interest. They often asked practical questions about learning, purchase, and so on (box).</p><p>From about 11-13 years, boys began to develop an aggressive response, which continued throughout the school years. They tried to put me off balance by suddenly shouting, jumping out of hiding, kicking a football, throwing stones, or riding a bicycle at me; a few asked for a ride in addition to aggressive behaviour.</p><p>A further change in male behaviour was seen during the late teens—aggression decreased, but they tried to make disparaging “jokes,” which were sometimes incorporated into mocking songs. This change continued, and finally evolved into adult male humour with its concealed aggression.</p><p>The female response was subdued during puberty and late teens, with apparent indifference or minimal approval, such as a tentative smile. It then evolved to the laudatory and concerned adult female response. Rarely, a male “joke” was made by girls in male company.</p></div><div id="sec-a.d.c.d"><h3 id="sec-a.d.c.dtitle">Miscellaneous observations</h3><p>Men who seemed to be of higher social class, older men, and the few Indian and Asian people encountered gave more approving and fewer comic responses. The response of people in cars was remarkable. Young men in old cars were very aggressive, acting as if to frighten me off the road—they lowered their windows and shouted abusively, waved their arms, and hooted. I did not see this with women drivers and older men in more expensive cars.</p></div></div><div id="sec-a.d.d"><h2 id="sec-a.d.dtitle">Discussion</h2><p>This study observed the response to a sudden, unexpected exposure to a new phenomenon—unicycling. The response to this stimulus was surprisingly consistent but varied with age, sex, and stage of sexual development. Young children were curious, but as boys grew older their response became physically and verbally aggressive. As boys matured to men their response became more verbal and evolved into the concealed aggression of a humorous verbal put-down, which was lost with age. In contrast, the female response was praise and concern for safety.</p><p>A strength of the study was that it involved the observation of an unexpected, spontaneous response, not a planned test of a preconception. Possible limitations are that the stimulus may have varied despite attempted consistency; but the main reservation is that because responses were not from a consecutive cohort or sample, the findings are only semi-quantitative. Fortunately, the differences found were large enough to overcome this; likewise the subjective assessments of relationships, age, and social class. Unicycles take one wheel and one person; confirmation by another rider, with a different style, appearance, dress, age, sex, and location is desirable, but the observed responses are still relevant to the situation studied</p><p>Biological systems are often best defined by stimulation—for example, the heart by exercise—but conscious modification makes this less reliable for mental responses. Sudden exposure to a novel stimulus lessens the opportunity for this, and the unprepared response is more likely to reflect an underlying attitude. Opportunistic use of unicycling in this way was validated by the consistency of the response to it. </p><p>The physical responses corresponded to the verbal ones, and added little to them. Most men clearly meant their responses to be funny and snide, and they were often given as a put-down. Women, however, usually responded with pleasure and admiration and were concerned about safety. The consistent content of the male “joke” and its triumphant delivery as if it was original and funny, even when it was neither, was remarkable, and it suggests a common underlying mechanism. The evolution of the response provides the clue to what this might be.</p><p>Children showed curiosity and interest, which changed in young boys. In older boys, curiosity was replaced by minor physical and verbal aggression—attempts to topple the unicycle coupled with first attempts at simple, mocking humour. In teenage boys, the physical aggression was replaced by verbally aggressive mockery, with elements of adult humour. This response “matured” to its adult male form as a mocking joke, which partly disguised its aggressive origins, an origin that was again revealed by the gross response of motorists, in whom aggressive behaviour is often exacerbated. This adult stage corresponded to the peak of virility and ameliorated in older men, who were more neutral and amicable, with few attempts at a jovial put-down.</p><p>The idea that unicycling is intrinsically funny cannot explain the findings—particularly their repetitiveness, evolution, and sex differences—and the notion that males are just expressing a greater sense of humour simply restates an observational fact. Social and ethnic differences seemed to soften the male response, and such a softening was also noted when unicycling in Framlingham, a small Suffolk town to which I had moved from Newcastle. A genetic effect would explain the sex difference, but not the waxing and waning of the male response—the simplest and most direct explanation is androgen induced virility. Such a causal association fits well with the observed evolution to aggression, an attribute related to androgens (figure[f1]), but direct endocrine confirmation would require studies not available to a unicyclist. The observed aggression could be a male response to confrontation, a situation where competition and combativeness are never far away. The male response to female unicyclists has yet to be studied, but the results of inquiries to unicyclists in other regions and countries suggest that the same jokes about wheels predominate.</p><!--fig ft0--><!--fig mode=article f1--><div id="fig" co-legend-rid="lgnd_fig"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2151169/figure/fig/" target="figure" rid-figpopup="fig" rid-ob="ob-fig"><!--fig/graphic|fig/alternatives/graphic mode="anchored" m1--></a><div data-largeobj="" data-largeobj-link-rid="largeobj_idm139675815956336"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&amp;p=PMC3&amp;id=2151169_shus457432.f1.jpg" target="tileshopwindow" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" alt="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.

This shows how the aggression that leads to humour eventually becomes separated from it as wit, jokes, and other comic forms, which then take on an independent life of their own.</p><p>These observations lead to the conclusion that humour evolves from androgen primed aggression. But can that conclusion be generalised? Repartee and banter have many of the characteristics of controlled aggression—so often revealed when control is lost—and it may be no coincidence that quick wit is likened to a rapier. The findings may also be relevant to the great male-female divide in humour—women tell fewer jokes than men and most comedians are men, despite some notable exceptions. The findings also suggest that the difference is sexual rather than social. I will not generalise into the many writings on humour—too many of which take an armchair view of the bedroom—from Freud on male humour as an aggressive response to women to the priapic interpretations of Roman sculptures and the effect of salacious comic cartoons on subsequent aggressive behaviour. The range of theoretical options on offer is too great and unproved for interpreting or extending a simple experimental study such as the response to unicycling.</p><p>The existence of an overwhelming sex difference inevitably raises the possibility of biological advantage, in particular whether male humour enhances female sexual preference. Marty Feldman, a notoriously unprepossessing comic, had no doubt of it, and Diane Keaton said she was mostly won over by men who made her laugh. Darwin’s <em>Descent of Man</em> defined the dominant evolutionary role of sexual selection.<sup><a href="#ref1" rid="ref1">1</a></sup> The components of mate attraction are becoming defined<sup><a href="#ref2" rid="ref2">2</a></sup>—the male woos and the female selects—and male humour seems to be involved.<sup><a href="#ref3" rid="ref3">3</a></sup> The present finding that humour may reflect androgen induced aggression could provide a Darwinian explanation both of its attraction and its continued use as a sexually useful tool.</p><p>And the female response? Embryologically, the female is the fundamental body form from which the male develops. Could it be that without androgens the human response would be female, with its favourable, warm, tolerant concern? Perhaps male aggression is too high a price for humour.</p><div id="sec-a.d.d.m"><h3 id="sec-a.d.d.mtitle">Conclusions</h3><p>The response to the unexpected and novel stimulus of seeing a unicyclist was surprisingly consistent even to the words and gestures used, and these varied with age, sex, and stage of sexual development. In males the response moved from curiosity in childhood, to physical and verbal aggression in older boys; this became more verbal as the boys matured into men and evolved into the concealed aggression of a repetitive humorous verbal put-down, which was lost with age. In contrast, the female response was praise and concern for safety. These findings suggest that humour develops from aggression in response to male hormones.</p></div></div><div id="notes-a.e.a"><h2 id="notes-a.e.atitle">Notes</h2><p>Competing interests: None, apart from owning a bicycle as well as a unicycle.</p><p>Provenance and peer review: Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.</p><p>This study arose from a chance observation that I extended for confirmation, and then for characterisation and analysis.</p></div><div id="ref-list-a.e.b"><h2 id="ref-list-a.e.btitle">References</h2><div id="reference-list"><p>1. <span>Darwin C. <span>The descent of man, and selection in relation to sex.</span> London: John Murray, 1871</span></p><p>2. <span>Buss DM. <span>The evolution of desire: strategies of human mating.</span> New York: Basic Books, 2003</span></p><p>3. <span>Miller G. <span>The mating mind</span> London: Vintage, 2001</span></p></div></div></div><!--post-content--><div><hr><p>Articles from <span>The BMJ</span> are provided here courtesy of <strong>BMJ Publishing Group</strong></p><hr></div></div>

<p>This article presents the rich text CRDT algorithm implemented in Loro, complying with <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Peritext<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>'s criteria for seamless rich text collaboration. Furthermore, it can be built on top of any List CRDT algorithms and turn them into rich text CRDTs.</p>

<!-- -->
<p>Above is an online demo of Loro's rich text CRDT, built with Quill. After the replay, you can simulate real-time collaboration and concurrent editing while offline. You can also drag on the history view to replay the editing history.</p>
<p>If CRDTs are new to you, our article <a href="https://www.loro.dev/docs/concepts/crdt">What are CRDTs</a> provides a brief introduction.</p>
<h2>Background<a href="#background" id="background" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Loro is based on the <a href="https://www.loro.dev/docs/advanced/replayable_event_graph">Replayable Event Graph (REG)</a> algorithm proposed by Seph Gentle, but this algorithm cannot integrate the original version of Peritext. This motivates us to create a new rich text algorithm. It is independent of the specific List CRDTs, thus working nicely with REG, and is developed on top of them to establish a rich text CRDT.</p>
<p>Before diving into the algorithm of Loro's rich text CRDT, I'd like to briefly introduce REG and Peritext, and why Peritext cannot be used on REG.</p>
<details><summary>Recap on List CRDTs</summary></details>
<h3>Brief Introduction to Replayable Event Graph<a href="#brief-introduction-to-replayable-event-graph" id="brief-introduction-to-replayable-event-graph" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/josephg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Seph Gentle<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>, the author of Replayable Event Graph, is currently working on the paper, and it's highly anticipated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>REG is a novel CRDT algorithm that combines the strengths of both OT and CRDTs. It has the distributed nature of CRDT that enables P2P collaboration and data ownership. Moreover, it achieves minimal overhead in scenarios devoid of concurrent edits, similar to OT.</p>
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<p>Whether in real-time collaboration or multi-end synchronization, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) forms over the history of these parallel edits, similar to Git's history. The REG algorithm records the history of user edits on the DAG.</p>
<p>Unlike conventional CRDTs, REG can record just the original description of operations, not the metadata of CRDTs. For instance, in text editing scenarios, the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0743731510002716" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RGA algorithm<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> needs the op ID and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Lamport timestamp<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> of the character to the left to determine the insertion point. <a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Yjs<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>/Fugue, however, requires the op ID of both the left and right characters at insertion. In contrast, REG simplifies this by only recording the index at the time of insertion. Loro, which uses <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Fugue<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> upon REG, inherits these advantages.</p>
<p>An index is not a stable position descriptor, as the index of an operation can be affected by other operations. For example, if you highlight content from <code dir="ltr">index=x</code> to <code dir="ltr">index=y</code>, and concurrently someone inserts n characters at <code dir="ltr">index=n</code> where <code dir="ltr">n&lt;x</code>, then your highlighted range should shift to cover from <code dir="ltr">x+n</code> to <code dir="ltr">y+n</code>. But REG can determine the exact position of this index by replaying history. Thus, it can reconstruct the corresponding CRDT structure by replaying history.</p>
<p>Reconstructing history might seem time-consuming, but REG can backtrack only some. When merging updates from remote sources, it only needs to replay operations parallel to the remote update, reconstructing the local CRDTs to calculate the diff after applying remote operations to the current document.</p>
<p>The REG algorithm excels with its fast local update speeds and eliminate concerns about tombstone collection in CRDTs.For instance, if an operation has been synchronized across all endpoints, no new operations will occur concurrently with it, allowing it to be safely removed from the history.</p>
<details><summary>What is Fugue</summary></details>
<h3>Brief Introduction to Peritext<a href="#brief-introduction-to-peritext" id="brief-introduction-to-peritext" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Peritext<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> was proposed by <em>Geoffrey Litt et al.</em> It's the first paper to discuss rich text CRDTs. It can merge concurrent edits in rich text format while <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/#preserving-the-authors-intent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">preserving users' intent as much as possible<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>. Its primary focus is merging the formats and annotations of rich text content, such as bold, italic, and comments. It was implemented in <a href="https://github.com/automerge/automerge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Automerge<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> and <a href="https://github.com/loro-dev/crdt-richtext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">crdt-richtext<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The specific definition of user intent in the context of concurrent rich text editing can't be clearly explained in a few words. It's best understood through particular examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peritext is designed to solve a couple of significant challenges:</p>
<p>Firstly, it addresses the anticipated problems arising from conflicting style edits. For instance, consider a text example, "The quick fox jumped." If User A highlights "The quick" in bold and User B highlights "quick fox jumped," the ideal merge should result in the entire sentence, "The quick fox jumped," being bold. However, existing algorithms might not meet this expectation, resulting in either "The quick fox" or "The" and "jumped" being bold instead.</p>

<p>Additionally, Peritext manages conflicts between style and text edits. In the same example, if User A highlights "The quick" in bold, but User B changes the text to "The fast fox jumped," the ideal merge should result in "The fast" being bold.</p>

<p>What’s more, Peritext takes into account different expectations for expanding styles. For example, if you type after a bold text, you would typically want the new text to continue being bold. However, if you're typing after a hyperlink or a comment, you likely wouldn't want the new input to become part of the hyperlink or comment.</p>
<p><img alt="Link style should not expand" loading="lazy" width="1700" height="670" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FPeritext.aa65d0ee.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FPeritext.aa65d0ee.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FPeritext.aa65d0ee.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>Illustration of Peritext's internal state. It uses the IDs of the character's ops to record the style ranges. In the example, the bold mark has the range of <code dir="ltr">{ start: { type: "before", opId: "9@B" }, end: { type: "before", opId: "10@B" }}</code></p>
<h3>Why Original Peritext Can't Be Directly Used with REG<a href="#why-original-peritext-cant-be-directly-used-with-reg" id="why-original-peritext-cant-be-directly-used-with-reg" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>On the one hand, Peritext's algorithm expresses style ranges <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/#generating-inline-formatting-operations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">through character OpIDs<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>. Without replaying history, CRDTs based on REG cannot determine the specific positions corresponding to these OpIDs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's not feasible to model Peritext on REG through replaying. This is because REG's "local backtracking suffices" relies on the algorithm satisfying "the same operation will produce the same effect, regardless of the current state," which Peritext does not adhere to. For example, when inserting the character "x" at position <code dir="ltr">p</code>, whether "x" is bold depends on "whether <code dir="ltr">p</code> is surrounded by bold" and "<a href="https://arc.net/l/quote/ifxpaand" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">whether the tombstones at <code dir="ltr">p</code> contain boundaries of bold and other styles<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>."</p>
<h2>Loro's Rich Text CRDT<a href="#loros-rich-text-crdt" id="loros-rich-text-crdt" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<h3>Algorithm<a href="#algorithm" id="algorithm" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>Loro implements rich text using special control characters called 'style anchors'. Each matching pair of start anchor and end anchor contains the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The op ID of the style operation</li>
<li>The style's key-value pair</li>
<li>The style's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Lamport timestamp<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a></li>
<li>Style expansion behavior: Determines whether newly inserted text before or after the style boundaries should inherit the style.</li>
</ul>
<p>The method to determine a character's style is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find all style anchor pairs that include the character, where each pair is created by the same style operation</li>
<li>Aggregate pairs according to the key. There may be multiple style pairs with the same key but different values. In such cases, the value with the greatest Lamport timestamp is chosen (if Lamport timestamps are equal, then use the peer ID to break the tie)</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrary to <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/#adding-control-characters-to-plain-text" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Yjs's method of using control characters<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> for rich text, our algorithm pairs start and end anchors when they originate from the same style operation. This approach accurately handles the following scenarios:</p>
<p><img alt="overlap_bold" loading="lazy" width="1889" height="1428" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Foverlap_bold.5c44773d.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Foverlap_bold.5c44773d.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Foverlap_bold.5c44773d.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>These special control characters are not exposed to the user; each control character is effectively of zero length from the user's perspective. Our data structure supports various methods of measuring text length for indexing text content. Besides Unicode, UTF-16, and UTF-8, we also measure our rich text length in <code dir="ltr">Entity length</code>. It treats each style anchor as an entity with a length of 1 and measures plain text in Unicode length.</p>
<p><img alt="len" loading="lazy" width="1226" height="440" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Flen.45cb3960.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Flen.45cb3960.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Flen.45cb3960.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>

<h4>Local Behavior<a href="#local-behavior" id="local-behavior" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h4>
<p>Multiple valid insertion points can exist when users insert text at a specific Unicode index. It occurs due to style anchors, which are zero-length elements from the user's perspective.</p>
<p><img alt="Two Different Kinds of Indexes" loading="lazy" width="1505" height="244" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ftwo_index.f9451eb9.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ftwo_index.f9451eb9.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ftwo_index.f9451eb9.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>For example, in the case of <code dir="ltr">&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt; world</code>, when a user inserts content at Unicode <code dir="ltr">index=5</code>, they face the choice of inserting to the left or right of <code dir="ltr">&lt;/b&gt;</code>. If the user sets the expand behavior of bold to expand forward, the new character will be inserted to the left of <code dir="ltr">&lt;/b&gt;</code>, making the inserted text bold as well.</p>
<p>When users delete text, Loro uses an additional mapping layer to avoid deleting style anchors within the text range.</p>
<p>To model the deletion of a style, a new style anchor pair with a null value is added.</p>
<p>We can implement the following optimizations to remove redundant style anchors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The style anchors that include no text can be removed.</li>
<li>When styles completely negate each other, like a span of bold is canceled by a span of unbold, we can remove their style anchors.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these behaviors happen locally, and the algorithm is independent of the specific List CRDT.</p>
<h5>Behavior When Inserting Text at Style Boundaries<a href="#behavior-when-inserting-text-at-style-boundaries" id="behavior-when-inserting-text-at-style-boundaries" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h5>
<p>Most modern rich text editors (Google Doc, Microsoft Word, Notion) behave as follows: when new text is entered right after bold text, the new text should inherit the bold style; when entered after a hyperlink, the new content should not inherit the hyperlink style. Different styles have varying preferences for text insertion positions, leading to potential conflicts. This is reflected in the degree of freedom we have when inserting new text.</p>
<p>Users interact with rich text based on text-based indexes, like the Unicode index. Since style anchors have a Unicode Length of 0, a Unicode index with n style anchors presents n + 1 potential insertion positions.</p>
<p>We select the insertion position based on the following rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Insertions occur before a start anchor of a style that should not expand backward.</li>
<li>Insertions occur before style anchors that signify the end of bold-like marks (expand = "after" or expand = "both").</li>
<li>Insertions occur after style anchors that signify the end of link-like marks (expand = "none" or expand = "before").</li>
</ol>
<p>Rule 1 should be prioritized over rules 2 and 3 to prevent <a href="https://github.com/inkandswitch/peritext/issues/32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the accidental creation of a new style<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>.</p>
<p>The current method first scans forward to find the last position satisfying rules 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Then, it scans backward to find the first position satisfying rule 3.</p>
<h4>Merging Remote Updates<a href="#merging-remote-updates" id="merging-remote-updates" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h4>
<p>Loro treats style anchors as a special element and handles them using the same List CRDT for resolving concurrent conflicts. The logic related to rich text is independent of the particular List CRDT. Therefore, this algorithm can rely on any List CRDT algorithm for merging remote operations. Loro utilizes the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Fugue<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> List CRDT algorithm.</p>
<p>When new style anchors are inserted by remote updates, new styles are added; if old style anchors are deleted, the corresponding old styles are removed.</p>
<h4>Strong Eventual Consistency<a href="#strong-eventual-consistency" id="strong-eventual-consistency" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h4>
<p>The internal state of this algorithm consists of a list of elements, each either a text segment or a style anchor. The rich text document is derived from this internal state.</p>
<p>The internal state achieves strong eventual consistency through the upstream List CRDT.</p>
<p>Identical internal states result in identical rich text documents. Hence, the same set of updates will produce the same rich text documents, evidencing the strong eventual consistency of this algorithm.</p>
<h3>Criteria in Peritext<a href="#criteria-in-peritext" id="criteria-in-peritext" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/static/cscw-publication.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Peritext paper<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> specifies the intent-preserving merge behavior for rich text inline format. Loro's rich text algorithm successfully passes all test cases outlined therein.</p>
<h4>1. Concurrent Formatting and Insertion<a href="#1-concurrent-formatting-and-insertion" id="1-concurrent-formatting-and-insertion" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h4>

<p>Loro easily supports this case by treating style anchors as special elements alongside text.</p>
<h4>2. Overlapping Formatting<a href="#2-overlapping-formatting" id="2-overlapping-formatting" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h4>

<p>This case has been analyzed earlier. Since our style anchors contain style op ID information, we know there are two bold segments: one from 0 to 5 and another from 3 to 11, allowing us to merge them.</p>

<p>Multiple style types are easily supported.</p>

<p>Like Peritext, we model unbolding by adding a new style with the key <code dir="ltr">bold</code> and the value <code dir="ltr">null</code>.
The final value of each style key on each character is determined by the style with the greatest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Lamport<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> timestamp that includes the character. Thus, it easily supports this case.</p>
<h4>3. Text Insertion at Span Boundaries<a href="#3-text-insertion-at-span-boundaries" id="3-text-insertion-at-span-boundaries" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h4>
<p>Insertion right after a bold style should result in the newly inserted text also being bold.</p>
<p><img alt="bold_expand" loading="lazy" width="1354" height="470" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fbold_expand.8ca1c7b5.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fbold_expand.8ca1c7b5.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fbold_expand.8ca1c7b5.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>However, insertion right after a link style should result in the newly inserted text not having the hyperlink style.</p>

<h4>4. Styles that Support Overlapping<a href="#4-styles-that-support-overlapping" id="4-styles-that-support-overlapping" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h4>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="734" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Foverlap_mark.8a170e5c.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Foverlap_mark.8a170e5c.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Foverlap_mark.8a170e5c.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>The problem of overlapping styles is related to how we represent them.</p>
<p>We represent the rich text using <a href="https://quilljs.com/docs/delta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Quill's Delta<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> format.</p>

<p>An example of Quill's Delta format</p>
<p>However, it cannot handle cases with multiple values assigned to the same key. So, it's a headache to handle the styles that support overlapping.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="1139" height="287" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Foverlap_comments.6dc9c59f.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Foverlap_comments.6dc9c59f.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Foverlap_comments.6dc9c59f.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>For example, in the above case, the text "fox" is commented on by both Alice and Bob. We can't represent it with Quill's Delta format directly.
So the possible workaround includes:</p>
<p><strong>Turn the attribute value into a list</strong></p>

<p><strong>Use op ID that creates the op as the key of the attribute</strong></p>

<p>But both require special behaviors for both CRDT lib and for application code, which are painful to work with.</p>
<p>Finally, we found that the optimal approach to represent an overlappable style was to use <code dir="ltr">&lt;key&gt;:</code> as a prefix and allow users to assign a unique suffix to create a distinct style key.
This method simplifies the CRDTs library code, as it doesn't require handling special cases.
It effectively addresses scenarios where multiple comments overlap and is also user-friendly for application coding.</p>

<p>Following is the example code in Loro:</p>

<h2>Implementation of Loro's Rich Text Algorithm<a href="#implementation-of-loros-rich-text-algorithm" id="implementation-of-loros-rich-text-algorithm" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>The following is an overview of Loro's implementation as of January, 2024.</p>
<h3>Architecture of Loro<a href="#architecture-of-loro" id="architecture-of-loro" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>In line with the properties of Replayable Event Graph, Loro uses <code dir="ltr">OpLog</code> and <code dir="ltr">DocState</code> as the internal state.</p>
<p><code dir="ltr">OpLog</code> is dedicated to recording history, while <code dir="ltr">DocState</code> only records the current document state and does not include historical operation information. When applying updates from remote sources, Loro uses the relevant operations from <code dir="ltr">OpLog</code> and computes the diff through a <code dir="ltr">DiffCalculator</code>. This diff is then applied to <code dir="ltr">DocState</code>. This architecture also makes time travel easier to implement.</p>
<p>For more details, see the documentation on <a href="https://loro.dev/docs/advanced/doc_state_and_oplog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DocState and OpLog<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="1217" height="1427" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fapply_updates.63c697d6.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fapply_updates.63c697d6.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fapply_updates.63c697d6.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<h3>Implementation of Loro's Rich Text CRDT<a href="#implementation-of-loros-rich-text-crdt" id="implementation-of-loros-rich-text-crdt" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>For rich text, Loro reuses the same <code dir="ltr">DiffCalculator</code> as Loro List, based on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Fugue<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> algorithm. As a result, the primary logic related to rich text is concentrated in <code dir="ltr">DocState</code>. This includes expressing styles, inserting new characters, and representing multiple index formats.</p>
<p>In the representation of rich text state, we distinguish between the data structure <code dir="ltr">ContentTree</code>, which expresses the text (including style anchors), and <code dir="ltr">StyleRangeMap</code>, which expresses styles.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="2112" height="1975" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ftext_state_arch.0364d666.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.loro.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ftext_state_arch.0364d666.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p>
<p>Both structures are built on B+Trees.</p>
<p><code dir="ltr">ContentTree</code> is responsible for efficient text finding, insertion, and deletion. It can index specific insertion/deletion positions using Unicode/UTF-8/UTF-16/Entity index. It does not store what specific style each text segment should have.</p>
<p>We built the following B+Tree structure based on our <a href="https://github.com/loro-dev/generic-btree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">generic-btree library<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a> to express text in memory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each internal node in the B+Tree stores the Unicode char length, UTF-16 length, UTF-8 length, and Entity length of its subtree. The Entity length considers the length of style anchors as 1, otherwise 0.</li>
<li>The leaf nodes of the B+Tree are text or style anchors.</li>
</ul>
<p><code dir="ltr">StyleRangeMap</code> is responsible for efficient updating/querying of style ranges.</p>
<p>In the <code dir="ltr">StyleRangeMap</code> B+Tree expressing styles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each internal node stores the <code dir="ltr">entity length</code> of its subtree.</li>
<li>Each leaf node stores the collection of style information for the corresponding range and its `entity length.</li>
</ul>
<p>Separating the text <code dir="ltr">ContentTree</code> and style <code dir="ltr">StyleRangeMap</code> into two structures aims for better performance optimization. On rich text, style information is often not abundant and tends to have good continuity, such as several paragraphs having the same format, which can be expressed with a single leaf node. However, our structure for storing text is unsuitable for leaf nodes with large content, as conversion time between different encoding formats would become excessively long.</p>
<p>When a user inserts a new character at <code dir="ltr">Unicode index</code> = i, the following occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the position at <code dir="ltr">Unicode index</code> = i in <code dir="ltr">ContentTree</code>.</li>
<li>Check if there are any adjacent style anchors at this position. If not, directly insert.</li>
<li>If there are, decide whether to insert to the left or right of the corresponding style anchor based on its type and properties. If there are multiple such style anchors, insert them according to the previous section on <a href="https://www.loro.dev/blog/loro-richtext#behavior-when-inserting-text-at-style-boundaries">"Behavior When Inserting Text at Style Boundaries"</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Testing<a href="#testing" id="testing" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h3>
<p>We have written tests for the criteria proposed by Peritext and passed all of them.</p>
<p>To ensure the correctness of our CRDTs, we have added numerous fuzzing tests to simulate different collaborative behaviors, synchronization behaviors, and time-travel behaviors. These tests check for the strong eventual consistency and the correctness of internal invariants. We run these fuzzing tests continuously for several days after every critical modification to avoid oversights.</p>
<h2>How to Use<a href="#how-to-use" id="how-to-use" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>Before using the Loro's rich text module, it is necessary to define the configuration for rich text styles, specifying the expand behavior for different keys and whether overlap is allowed.</p>
<p>Here is an example of using Loro's rich text in JavaScript:</p>

<h2>Summary<a href="#summary" id="summary" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2>
<p>This article presents Loro's rich text algorithm design and implementation. Its correctness is readily demonstrable. It can be built upon any existing List CRDT algorithm. It allows Loro to support rich text collaboration using <a href="https://www.loro.dev/blog/loro-richtext#brief-introduction-to-replayable-event-graph">REG</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Fugue<span> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>, combining the strengths of multiple CRDT algorithms.</p>
<p>We are continuously refining its design and actively seeking design partners. We are open to all forms of feedback and constructive criticism.

        <p>Researchers have long been puzzled by the Roman <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/can-you-decode-the-roman-dodecahedron/5wVh18uEpJuMnA?hl=en">dodecahedron</a>. More than 100 of these strange 12-sided metal objects have been found throughout Europe—but their purpose remains unclear. Now, another discovery in England’s countryside has reignited the mystery surrounding the ancient artifacts.</p>

<p>A volunteer with the <a href="https://nortondisneyhag.org/">Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group</a> unearthed the dodecahedron in the Lincolnshire village of Norton Disney over the summer. The group’s secretary, Richard Parker, tells <em>Smithsonian </em>magazine the artifact is “the find of a lifetime.”</p>

<p>“[Dodecahedrons] are one of archaeology’s great enigmas,” he says. “Our example is remarkable. It’s in an excellent condition—considering it’s been buried for 1,700 years—and complete with no damage.</p>

<p>As Parker tells&nbsp;<a href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/romans/roman-dodecahedron-uncovered-by-amateur-archaeologists-in-the-uk"><em>Live Science</em></a>’s Tom Metcalfe, the group was performing a two-week search for artifacts in a field where metal detectorists had previously discovered Roman coins and broaches. When the dodecahedron appeared in the excavation’s final days, “we were completely surprised by it,” says Parker.</p>

<p>The hollow, grapefruit-sized object is made of copper alloy, as the Norton Disney group writes on its&nbsp;<a href="https://nortondisneyhag.org/?page_id=2406">website</a>. Its 12 flat sides are punctuated by circular cut-outs and studs on each corner.</p>

<p>According to the group, the discovery brings the number of dodecahedrons unearthed in Roman Britain to 33, while about 130 have been discovered throughout the Roman Empire’s northwest provinces. This one stands out because it’s still in one piece, while many of the others were found <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/amateur-archaeologist-discovers-mysterious-roman-object-possibly-used-for-magic-180981582/">fragmented</a> or damaged.</p>

<p>“It is well cast, complete with no damage,” writes the group. “It is an example of very fine craftsmanship, finished to a high standard.” The newly discovered dodecahedron is also larger than many of its counterparts, some of which are as small as a golf ball, reports <em>Live Science. </em></p>

<p>Some Roman dodecahedrons <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/roman-dodecahedron-archaeology-sheffield-b2482023.html">date to</a> as early as the first century C.E. However, no visual or textual references to the objects have been found in historical records. Lacking context, the dodecahedron has become an enduring mystery of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>“Nobody knows for certain how the Romans used them,” wrote <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/amateur-archaeologist-discovers-mysterious-roman-object-possibly-used-for-magic-180981582/"><em>Smithsonian </em>magazine</a>’s<em> </em>Sarah Kuta last year. “Some theories are that they functioned as measuring devices, calendars, ornamental scepter toppers, weapons or tools.”</p>

<p>The Norton Disney group thinks most of these theories are unlikely. Parker says the piece was cast in “sticky,” leaden metal—making it difficult to mold—and was fragile in texture.</p>

<p>“A huge amount of time, energy and skill was taken to create our dodecahedron, so it was not used for mundane purposes,” writes the group, adding: “They are not of a standard size, so will not be measuring devices. They don’t show signs of wear, so they are not a tool.”</p>

<p>Instead, the group agrees with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/fragment-roman-dodecahedron-found-belgium-1234656082/">experts</a> who think dodecahedrons were used for ritualistic or religious purposes. As <em>Smithsonian</em> magazine wrote last year, researchers at Belgium’s Gallo-Roman Museum have hypothesized that Romans used the objects in magical rituals, which could explain dodecahedrons’ absence from historical records: With the Roman Empire’s eventual embrace of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pbs.org/empires/romans/empire/christians.html">Christianity</a> came laws forbidding magic. Practitioners would have had to keep their rituals—and related objects—a secret.</p>

<p>“Roman society was full of superstition,” writes the Norton Disney group. “A potential link with local religious practice is our current working theory. More investigation is required, though.”</p>

<p>The dodecahedron was recently shown on the BBC’s “<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b014hl0d">Digging for Britain</a>” and is now on display in the nearby <a href="https://www.newark-sherwooddc.gov.uk/latest-news/2024/january/mystery-roman-object-now-on-display-at-the-ncwc/">National Civil War Center: Newark Museum</a>.</p>

<p>“It still holds many secrets,” Parker tells <em>Smithsonian</em>. “It is hoped some more scientific tests on the dodecahedron will reveal more clues about its possible use and purpose.”</p>

		<p>A reader at respected airline industry site <i>Leeham News</i> offered <a href="https://leehamnews.com/2024/01/15/unplanned-removal-installation-inspection-procedure-at-boeing/#comment-509962" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a comment</a> that suggests they have access to Boeing’s internal quality control systems, and shares details of what they saw regarding the Boeing 737 MAX 9 flown by Alaska Airlines that had a door plug detach inflight, causing rapid decompression of the aircraft.
</p><p>The takeaway appears to be that outsourced plane components have so many problems when they show up at the production line that Boeing’s quality control staff can’t keep up with them all.</p>
<blockquote><p>Current Boeing employee here – I will save you waiting two years for the NTSB report to come out and give it to you for free: the reason the door blew off is stated in black and white in Boeings own records. It is also very, very stupid and speaks volumes about the quality culture at certain portions of the business.</p>
<p>…With that out of the way… why did the left hand (LH) mid-exit door plug blow off of the 737-9 registered as N704AL? Simple- as has been covered in a number of articles and videos across aviation channels, there are 4 bolts that prevent the mid-exit door plug from sliding up off of the door stop fittings that take the actual pressurization loads in flight, and these 4 bolts were not installed when Boeing delivered the airplane, our own records reflect this.</p>
<p>…As a result, this check job that should find minimal defects has in the past 365 calendar days recorded 392 nonconforming findings on 737 mid fuselage door installations (so both actual doors for the high density configs, and plugs like the one that blew out). That is a hideously high and very alarming number, and if our quality system on 737 was healthy, it would have stopped the line and driven the issue back to supplier after the first few instances. </p>
<p>…Now, on the incident aircraft this check job was completed on 31 August 2023, and did turn up discrepancies, but on the RH side door, not the LH that actually failed. I could blame the team for missing certain details, but given the enormous volume of defects they were already finding and fixing, it was inevitable something would slip through- and on the incident aircraft something did. I know what you are thinking at this point, but grab some popcorn because there is a plot twist coming up.</p>
<p>The next day on 1 September 2023 a different team (remember 737s flow through the factory quite quickly, 24 hours completely changes who is working on the plane) wrote up a finding for damaged and improperly installed rivets on the LH mid-exit door of the incident aircraft.</p>
<p>…Because there are so many problems with the Spirit build in the 737, Spirit has teams on site in Renton performing warranty work for all of their shoddy quality, and this SAT promptly gets shunted into their queue as a warranty item. Lots of bickering ensues in the SAT messages, and it takes a bit for Spirit to get to the work package. Once they have finished, they send it back to a Boeing QA for final acceptance, but then Malicious Stupid Happens! The Boeing QA writes another record in CMES (again, the correct venue) stating (with pictures) that Spirit has not actually reworked the discrepant rivets, they *just painted over the defects*. In Boeing production speak, this is a “process failure”. For an A&amp;P mechanic at an airline, this would be called “federal crime”.</p>
<p>…finally we get to the damning entry which reads something along the lines of “coordinating with the doors team to determine if the door will have to be removed entirely, or just opened. If it is removed then a Removal will have to be written.” Note: a Removal is a type of record in CMES that requires formal sign off from QA that the airplane been restored to drawing requirements.</p>
<p>If you have been paying attention to this situation closely, you may be able to spot the critical error: regardless of whether the door is simply opened or removed entirely, the 4 retaining bolts that keep it from sliding off of the door stops have to be pulled out. A removal should be written in either case for QA to verify install, but as it turns out, someone (exactly who will be a fun question for investigators) decides that the door only needs to be opened, and no formal Removal is generated in CMES (the reason for which is unclear, and a major process failure). Therefore, in the official build records of the airplane, a pressure seal that cannot be accessed without opening the door (and thereby removing retaining bolts) is documented as being replaced, but the door is never officially opened and thus no QA inspection is required.</p></blockquote>	<!-- /1019006/BoardingArea_DynamicContent -->
	
	
<p>The commenter concludes, “Where are the bolts? Probably sitting forgotten and unlabeled (because there is no formal record number to label them with) on a work-in-progress bench, unless someone already tossed them in the scrap bin to tidy up.”</p>
<p>The information was first flagged by aviation watchdog <b>JonNYC</b>.</p>

<p>Boeing <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/boeings-response-to-737-max-crisis-more-inspections-team-reviews-but-is-it-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outsources a lot of the production of components for its aircraft because it’s cheaper</a> as part of an overall shift in strategy that dates to CEO Harry Stonecipher who had been CEO of McDonnell Douglas,</p>
<blockquote><p>When people say I changed the culture of Boeing, that was the intent, so that it’s run like a business rather than a great engineering firm.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the major suppliers is Spirit AeroSystems, which used to be <i>part of Boeing</i> and was spun out and sold to private equity in 2005.  That’s whose work is at issue here.</p>
<p>This story suggests a one-off mistake with this particular part on this particular aircraft, though also that production issues are common.  That doesn’t square with a theory that <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/is-there-a-design-flaw-in-the-boeing-737-max-9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bolts could have come loose from flying a poorly-designed aircraft</a>, or that Boeing 737-900ERs <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68052160" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are being inspected too</a>.  Those have the same door plug because the MAX 9 is built on the same airframe.  It may or may not square with finding loose door plugs on other Boeing 737 MAX 9s.</p>
<p>So this story is far from ‘official’ but it seems knowledgeable from someone who suggests they’re a whistleblower inside of Boeing.   A story in <i>Politico</i> this morning suggests that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/22/boeing-lobbying-congress-faa-00136704#:~:text=Boeing%20is%20still%20a%20sprawling,Patton%20Boggs%20and%20Crossroads%20Strategies." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boeing’s new team of lobbyists has their work cut out for them</a>.  It certainly appears so, but perhaps work needs to start at the board and C-suite level.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I was at <a href="https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/">cfgmgmtcamp 2019</a> in Ghent, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBm3oyUmoAo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=18586">did a talk</a> which I think was well received about the need for some Kubernetes configuration management as well as the solution we built for it at $work, <a href="https://kr8.rocks/">kr8</a>.</p>
<p>I made a statement during the talk which ignited some fairly fierce discussion both online, and at the conference:</p>
<blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"If you're starting to template yaml, ask yourself the question: why am I not *generating* json?" - <a href="https://twitter.com/briggsl?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@briggsl</a> spitting straight fire at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cfgmgmtcamp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#cfgmgmtcamp</a></p>— 🌈eric sorenson 🌊 (@ahpook) <a href="https://twitter.com/ahpook/status/1092810831216197643?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2019</a></blockquote>

<p>To put this into my own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At some point, we decided it was okay for us to template yaml. When did this happen? How is this acceptable?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After some conversation, I figured it was probably best to back up my claims in some way. This blog post is going to try to do that.</p>
<h2 id="the-configuration-problem">The configuration problem</h2>
<p>Once the applications and infrastructure you’re going to manage grows past a certain size, you inevitably end up in some form of configuration complexity hell. If you’re only deploying 1 or maybe 2 things, you can write a yaml configuration file and be done with it. However once you grow beyond that, you need to figure out how to manage this complexity. It’s incredibly likely that the reason you have multiple configuration files is because the $thing that uses that config is slightly different from its companions. Examples of this include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications deployed in different environments, like dev, stg and prod
</li><li>Applications deployed in different regions, like Europe or North American
</li></ul>
<p>Obviously, not <em>all</em> the configuration is different here, but it’s likely the configuration differs enough that you want to be able to differentiate between the two.</p>
<p>This configuration complexity has been well known for Operators (System Administrators, DevOps engineers, whatever you want to call them) for some years now. An entire discpline grew up around this in Configuration Management, and each tool solved this problem in their own way, but ultimately, they used YAML to get the job done.</p>
<p>My favourite method has always been <a href="https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6.2/hiera_intro.html">hiera</a> which comes bundled with Puppet. Having the ability to hierarchically look up the variables of specific config needs is incredibly powerful and flexible, and has generally meant you don’t actually need to do any templating of yaml at all, except perhaps for embedding Puppet facts into the yaml.</p>
<h2 id="did-we-go-backwards">Did we go backwards?</h2>
<p>Then, as our industries’ needs moved above the operating system and into cloud computing, we had a whole new data plane to configure. The tooling to configure this changed, and tools like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation</a> and <a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a> appeared. These tools are excellent configuration tools, but I firmly believe we (as an industry) got something really, really wrong when we designed them. To examine that, let’s take a look at example of a helm chart taking a custom parameter</p>
<h3 id="helm-charts">Helm Charts</h3>
<p>Helm charts can take external parameters defined by an <code>values.yaml</code> file which you specify when rendering the chart. A simple example might look like this:</p>
<p>Let’s say my external parameter is simple - it’s a string. It’d look a bit like this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>image</span><span>:</span> <span>"{{ .Values.image }}"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>That’s not so bad right? You just specify a value for <code>image</code> in your values.yaml and you’re on your way.</p>
<p>The real problem starts to get highlighted when you want to do more complicated and complex things. In this particular example, you’re doing okay because you <em>know</em> you have to specify an image for a Kubernetes deployment. However, what if you’re working with something like an optional field? Well, then it gets a little more unwieldy:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{{</span><span>-</span> <span>with</span> <span>.</span><span>resourceGroup</span>  <span>}}</span>
    <span>resourceGroup</span><span>:</span> <span>{{</span> <span>.</span>  <span>}}</span>
<span>{{</span><span>-</span> <span>end</span> <span>}}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Optional values just make things ugly in templating languages, and you can’t just leave the value blank, so you have to resort to ugly loops and conditionals that are probably going to bite you later.</p>
<p>Let’s say you need to go a step further, and you need to push an array or map into the config. With helm, you’d do something like this.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{{</span><span>-</span> <span>with</span> <span>.</span><span>Values</span><span>.</span><span>podAnnotations</span>  <span>}}</span>
      <span>annotations</span><span>:</span>
<span>{{</span> <span>toYaml</span> <span>.</span> <span>|</span> <span>indent</span> <span>8</span>  <span>}}</span>
<span>{{</span><span>-</span> <span>end</span>  <span>}}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Firstly, let’s ignore the madness of having a templating function <code>toYaml</code> to convert yaml to yaml and focus more on the whitespace issue here.</p>
<p>YAML has strict requirements and whitespace implementation rules. The following, for example, is not valid or complete yaml:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>something</span><span>:</span> <span>nothing</span>
  <span>hello</span><span>:</span> <span>goodbye</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Generally, if you’re handwriting something, this isn’t necessarily a problem because you just hit backspace twice and it’s fixed. However, if you’re generating YAML using a templating system, you can’t do that - and if you’re operating above 5 or 10 configuration files, you probably want to be <em>generating</em> your config rather than writing it.</p>
<p>So, in the above example, you want to embed the values of <code>.Values.podAnnotations</code> under the annotations field, which is indented already. So you’re having to not only indent your values, but indent them correctly.</p>
<p>What makes this <em>even more confusing</em> is that the go parser doesn’t actually know anything about YAML at all, so if you try to keep the syntax clean and indent the templates like this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{{</span><span>-</span> <span>with</span> <span>.</span><span>Values</span><span>.</span><span>podAnnotations</span> <span>}}</span>
      <span>annotations</span><span>:</span>
      <span>{{</span> <span>toYaml</span> <span>.</span> <span>|</span> <span>indent</span> <span>6</span> <span>}}</span>
<span>{{</span><span>-</span> <span>end</span>  <span>}}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You actually can’t do that, because the templating system gets confused. This is a singular example of the complexity and difficulty you end up facing when generating config data in YAML, but when you really start to do more complex work, it really starts to become obvious that this isn’t the way to go.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this isn’t what I want to spend <em>my</em> time doing. If fiddling around with whitespace requirements in a templating system doing something it’s not really designed for is what suits you, then I’m not going to stop you. I also don’t want to spend my time writing configuration in JSON without comments and accidentally missing commas all over the shop. We (as an industry) decided a long time ago that shit wasn’t going to work and that’s why YAML exists.</p>
<p>So what should we do instead? That’s where <a href="https://jsonnet.org/">jsonnet</a> comes in.</p>
<h2 id="json-jsonnet--yaml">JSON, Jsonnet &amp; YAML</h2>
<p>Before we actually talk about Jsonnet, it’s worth reminding people of a very important (but oft forgotten point). <a href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2759572">YAML is a superset of JSON</a> and converting between the two is trivial. Many applications and programming languages will parse JSON and YAML natively, and many can convert between the two very simple. For example, in Python:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>python</span> <span>-</span><span>c</span> <span>'import json, sys, yaml ; y=yaml.safe_load(sys.stdin.read()) ; print(json.dumps(y))'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So with that in mind, let’s talk about Jsonnet.</p>
<h3 id="welcome-to-the-church-of-jsonnet">Welcome to the church of Jsonnet</h3>
<p>Jsonnet is a relatively new, little known (outside the Kubernetes community?) language that calls itself a <em>data templating language</em>. It’s definitely a good exercise to read and consume the Jsonnet <a href="https://jsonnet.org/articles/design.html">design rationale</a> page to get an idea why it exists, but if I was going to define in a nutshell what its purpose is - it’s to generate JSON config.</p>
<p>So, how does it help, exactly?</p>
<p>Well, let’s take our earlier example - we want to generate some JSON config specifying a parameter (ie, the image string). We can do that very very easily with Jsonnet using external variables.</p>
<p>Firstly, let’s define some Jsonnet:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{</span>

  <span>image</span><span>:</span> <span>std</span><span>.</span><span>extVar</span><span>(</span><span>'image'</span><span>),</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then, we can generate it using the Jsonnet command line tool, passing in the external variable as we need to:</p>
<div><pre><code>jsonnet image.jsonnet <span>-V</span> <span>image</span><span>=</span><span>"my-image"</span>
<span>{</span>
   <span>"image"</span>: <span>"my-image"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Easy!</p>
<h3 id="optional-fields">Optional fields</h3>
<p>Before, I noted that if you wanted to define an optional field, with YAML templating you had to define if statements for everything. With Jsonnet, you’re just defining code!</p>
<div><pre><code><span>// define a variable - yes, jsonnet also has comments</span>
<span>local</span> <span>rg</span> <span>=</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span>
<span>{</span>


  <span>image</span><span>:</span> <span>std</span><span>.</span><span>extVar</span><span>(</span><span>'image'</span><span>),</span>
  <span>// if the variable is null, this will be blank</span>
  <span>[</span><span>if</span> <span>rg</span> <span>!</span><span>=</span> <span>null</span> <span>then</span> <span>'resourceGroup'</span><span>]:</span> <span>rg</span><span>,</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The output here, because our variable is null, means that we never actually populate resourceGroup. If you specify a value, it will appear:</p>
<div><pre><code>jsonnet image.jsonnet <span>-V</span> <span>image</span><span>=</span><span>"my-image"</span> 
<span>{</span>
   <span>"image"</span>: <span>"my-image"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="maps-and-parameters">Maps and parameters</h3>
<p>Okay, now let’s look at our previous annotation example. We want to define some pod annotations, which takes a YAML map as its input. You want this map to be configurable by specifying external data, and obviously doing that on the command line sucks (you’d be very unlikely to specify this with Helm on the command line, for example) so generally you’d use Jsonnet imports to this. I’m going to specify this config as a variable and then load that variable into the annotation:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>annotations</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>'nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/app-root'</span><span>:</span> <span>'/'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors'</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>{</span>
  <span>metadata</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>// annotations are nested under the metadata of a pod</span>
    <span>annotations</span><span>:</span> <span>annotations</span><span>,</span>
  <span>},</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This might just be my bias towards Jsonnet talking, but this is so dramatically easier than faffing about with indentation that I can’t even begin to describe it.</p>
<h3 id="additional-goodies">Additional goodies</h3>
<p>The final thing I wanted to quickly explore, which is something that I feel can’t really be done with Helm and other yaml templating tools, is the concept of manipulating existing objects in config.</p>
<p>Let’s take our example above with the annotations, and look at the result file:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
   </span><span>"metadata"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>"annotations"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
         </span><span>"nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/app-root"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"/"</span><span>,</span><span>
         </span><span>"nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
      </span><span>}</span><span>
   </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, let’s say for example I wanted to append a set of annotations to this annotations map. In any templating system, I’d probably have to rewrite the whole map.</p>
<p>Jsonnet makes this <em>trivial</em>. I can simply use the <code>+</code> operator to add something to this. Here’s a (poor) example:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>annotations</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>'nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/app-root'</span><span>:</span> <span>'/'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors'</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>{</span>
  <span>metadata</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>annotations</span><span>:</span> <span>annotations</span><span>,</span>
  <span>},</span>
<span>}</span> <span>+</span> <span>{</span> <span>// this adds another JSON object</span>
  <span>metadata</span><span>+:</span> <span>{</span> <span>// I'm using the + operator, so we'll append to the existing metadata</span>
    <span>annotations</span><span>+:</span> <span>{</span> <span>// same as above</span>
      <span>something</span><span>:</span> <span>'nothing'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
  <span>},</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The end result is this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
   </span><span>"metadata"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>"annotations"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
         </span><span>"nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/app-root"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"/"</span><span>,</span><span>
         </span><span>"nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>,</span><span>
         </span><span>"something"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"nothing"</span><span>
      </span><span>}</span><span>
   </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Obviously, in this case, it’s more code to this, but as your example get more complex, it becomes extremely useful to be able to manipulate objects this way.</p>
<h2 id="kr8">Kr8</h2>
<p>We use all of these methods in <a href="https://kr8.rocks/">kr8</a> to make creating and manipulating configuration for multiple Kubernetes clusters easy and simple. I highly recommend you check it out if any of the concepts you’ve found here have found you nodding your head.</p>

<p><span>Bialetti, the Italian maker of </span>the moka pot, a stovetop coffee machine and one of the most iconic kitchen appliances ever created, announced in 2018 that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/28/trouble-brewing-classic-italian-moka-pot-coffee-pods-dominate/">the company was in major trouble</a>—tens of millions of Euros in debt, unpaid salaries and taxes, revenues that are way down and look to be staying that way. In a press release, the company said there are “doubts over its continuity.” (Update: <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/04/24/bialetti-moka-pot-italian-icon-coffee-espresso-comeback/">Bialetti sales have been on the rise</a> since then.)</p>
<p>The moka pot is a symbol of Italy: of postwar ingenuity and global culinary dominance. It is in the Museum of Modern Art, the Cooper-Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum, and other temples to design. It is in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world’s most popular coffee maker, and was for decades commonplace to the point of ubiquity not only in Italy but in Cuba, Argentina, Australia, and the United States. It’s also widely misunderstood and maligned, with approval in the modern coffee world coming perhaps a bit too late, in only the past few years. Get one while you can.</p>
<hr>
<p><span>Italy’s place in the history </span>of global coffee culture is substantial, but for different reasons and in different ways than most people probably think. The various species of <em>Coffea</em>, the seeds of which are dried, roasted, and ground to make coffee, are native to east Africa, particularly Ethiopia. Coffee as a beverage first shows up in the historical record—which is not necessarily to say that it wasn’t consumed in its native Ethiopia first—in what is now Yemen. It spread quickly throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and firmly established itself as part of the culture in what are now Turkey and Iran.</p>
<p>Europeans were late to the coffee party, but Italy, sharing the Mediterranean with the Arab and Greek worlds and not really very far from North Africa, was probably the gateway for coffee to spread westward. But for centuries after its introduction to Venice in the early 17th century, coffee was seen as an Arab affectation, something foreign and alternately exotic and threatening. “It was thought of as an Eastern thing, in that Orientalist way of thinking,” says Peter Giuliano, the chief research officer for the Specialty Coffee Association and a former co-owner of the influential Counter Culture coffee company.</p>

<p>Until the late 19th century, Italians drank coffee in pretty much the same way as the Turks. Coffee and water are combined in a long-handled metal pot called a <em>cezve</em> and held over a heat source; the mixture combines as it boils, and is poured into small cups, where the grounds settle to the bottom. Italy never really left behind the idea of small amounts of very strong coffee. The thinner, lighter, larger mugfuls of coffee were more a northern European, and North American, thing.</p>
<p>Italians began coming up with their own gadgets for brewing coffee in the 19th century, but the biggest by far was the idea of applying pressure to coffee in order to create a strong, and more importantly fast, drink. This is the age of steam, a miraculous source of power that can unlock the world, and though it’s not entirely clear who originated the idea of using steam to brew coffee, certainly it was in Italy that it was popularized. The first known patent for a machine we might now recognize as an espresso machine was registered by Angelo Moriondo, who created a giant complicated steam-driven machine in 1884, but who never bothered to manufacture it. Luigi Bezzera, from Milan, modified the Moriondo patent, and <em>his</em> design was further modified (though less so than Bezzera’s) by Desidiero Pavoni, whose La Pavoni introduced the world to espresso in 1906, at a world’s fair held in Milan.</p>

<p>Pavoni’s device was a large complex metal contraption that worked, roughly, like this. A compartment of water on the bottom of the device is heated by placing the entire thing on a flame. A tube leads up to a circular puck of ground coffee; because the entire device is sealed, as the water boils, pressure forces steam and hot water up through the tube and through the coffee grounds. That pressure brews coffee much more quickly than without the pressure, and the fast-brewed, strong coffee flows into a chamber, to be poured into cups.</p>
<p>This is, not coincidentally, the exact same way the moka pot works, though on a much smaller scale.</p>
<p>Pavoni’s device was a huge hit, but it was incredibly expensive and cumbersome. It wasn’t at all suitable for use at home, which was fine for a few decades because coffee had never been a beverage consumed at home anyway. It was, as in the Arab world, a communal activity. (As a side note, the fact that it was a communal and foreign-seeming ritual seems to have scared those in power in the Catholic world quite a bit at first; it took an official approval from Pope Clement VIII in 1600 to clear coffee’s dangerous connotations.) Coffee was too expensive, and the newly popular Pavoni brewing devices unsuited, to be making coffee at home.</p>
<p>Jeffrey T. Schnapp outlines the history of the moka pot in a 2001 paper called <em>The Romance of Caffeine and Aluminum</em>. In 1918, he writes, a Piedmontese metalworker named Alfonso Bialetti returned home after a decade spent working with aluminum in France. Industrial production of aluminum was new, then; methods for working with it at any real scale had only been developed in 1886. He opened a shop, crafting strong, lightweight aluminum versions of pots and pans that had previously been only available in iron.</p>
<p>Legend has it that the idea for the moka pot came from a laundry boiler, though that’s not confirmed. What is known is that the La Pavoni device was very trendy, and there was also a precedent for a smaller coffee machine: the <em>napoletana</em>. The <em>napoletana</em> is a small metal device with three sections: a chamber of water, a small puck of coffee in the middle, and a chamber on the other end for brewed coffee. Water is heated up with the water chamber on the bottom, and then the entire device is flipped upside-down, allowing the hot water to drip through the coffee beans and gather as coffee in the previously empty chamber. No pressure is involved.</p>

<p>Bialetti worked on some combination of the La Pavoni and the <em>napoletana </em>for a few years and in 1933 patented his Bialetti Moka Express. It’s three-chambered, like the <em>napoletana</em>, but uses steam power to force hot water through the coffee, like the La Pavoni. The characteristic hourglass shape, with the eight-sided chambers, was there from the beginning.</p>
<p>But the Moka Express design—today, “Bialetti Moka Express” is the specific product, while “moka pot” is the general term for this type of coffee maker—took a while to catch on. Italy still had to get embroiled in a couple of World Wars, and then recover.* By the 1950s, Italian design had some amazing advantages. All of the factories set up to create war materials were at a loss for products to make, as were a generation of skilled manufacturers. Vespa, Fiat, and Alfa Romeo designed incredible vehicles. And Bialetti’s Moka Express, which still boasted a futuristic and clever design, suddenly took off.</p>

<p>Post-war Italy had a surging economy, a growing middle class, and the same access to the world’s products that the rest of Europe boasted. Alfonso Bialetti’s son, Renato, came back to Piedmont in 1946 to take over his father’s shop, and decided to stop making everything except one product: the Moka Express. The newly low price of aluminum and coffee, and a growing middle class of people who could buy products like this, made the moka pot a perfect device for the time. Renato was also a pretty shrewd businessman; in 1953, he commissioned the drawing of the company’s logo, <em>L’omino con i baffi</em>, “the little man with the mustache,” which has since been inseparable from the Moka Express. The Moka Express was “the first way that Italians could realistically make coffee at home that was some approximation of what they could get outside,” says Giuliano.</p>
<p>Over the next 60 years, the moka pot would conquer the world. As of 2016, the <em>New York Times</em> notes that over 90 percent of Italian homes had one. It became so iconic that Renato Bialetti, when he died in early 2016, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/18/europe/italy-bialetti-moka-urn/index.html">was actually buried</a> in a large replica of the moka pot. It spread to some countries with large Italian immigrant populations, becoming common in the Italian-American communities in and around Philadelphia, New York City, and Chicago. Argentina and Australia, both of which received large waves of Italian immigration in the 20th century, are also home to plenty of moka pots. The Argentinian company Volturno has been so successful that the moka pot in Argentina is sometimes called a Volturno.</p>

<p>Cuba is a more interesting one. Coffee has a long history in Cuba; the climate, hot and wet with plenty of elevation, is ideal for growing coffee, and the crop has been grown there since the mid-1700s. Up until the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Cuba was one of the world’s great coffee producers, and also one of the world’s great coffee cultures. Coffee preparation varied; in the cities, espresso was common, and on coffee plantations, it was more typical to grind beans in a mortar called a <em>pilón</em> and steep with hot water before straining out the grounds with cloth.</p>
<p>After the 1959 revolution, food rations came for coffee as well. Coffee is currently rationed to four ounces per person per month, coming in two packets. But these rations aren’t pure coffee; <a href="https://havanatimes.org/?p=120256">they are mixed</a> with fillers, sometimes toasted chickpeas (<em>cafe con chicharo</em>) to make the small amounts go further.</p>
<p>Because the amounts of coffee are so low, and efficiency so important, Cubans began tinkering to come up with ways to create the best possible coffee with the materials they have. Cuban coffee in a Cuban or Cuban-American home is almost always made with a moka pot; the Cuban concoction <em>cafecito</em> is made by quickly whipping the first few drops of moka pot coffee with sugar, creating a paste that both flavors the coffee and simulates a classic espresso foam. Even outside of Cuba, where the coffee is not likely to be mixed with toasted beans, Cuban coffee is typically very sweet and very strong, almost always made with a pump machine in coffee shops and a moka pot at home.</p>
<hr>
<p><span>The moka pot’s struggles began </span>in the 1990s, and came in two forms. One, I think, is very interesting, but is not as large a factor in the demise of the moka pot as some might believe. The other is very boring and very obvious and is almost certainly the big problem. The latter is that people, in Italy and elsewhere, love coffee pods. Coffee pods, especially Nespresso, are wildly popular in Italy, because they are easy. I have very little else to say about coffee pods.</p>
<p>The former problem, the more interesting one, took place within the coffee-nerd world.</p>
<p>Inspired by Italian espresso bar culture, Starbucks almost single-handedly changed the entire concept of coffee in America. And the moka pot was not part of that. The espresso machine, which uses mechanical pressure (via pumps and/or levers), was the device used to make coffee in Italian coffee shops; the moka was strictly for the home. “In the ‘90s and early ‘00s, having some sort of ‘authentic’ Italian coffee chops were part of what was exciting and interesting about coffee,” says Giuliano, who lived through this phase at Counter Culture. In the 1990s, coffee shops, which greatly informed coffee consumption in the U.S. in general, looked to Italian coffee bars.</p>

<p>This ignored that Italians never really made espresso at home. They used the moka pot. Espresso machines, then and now, are gigantic, expensive, difficult to use, and incredibly inefficient from an energy perspective. They do not really make sense for the home. But Americans tried anyway, replacing their Mr. Coffees and French presses with underpowered home espresso machines, ignoring the entire time that there was another option, the one Italians used all along.</p>
<p>After the Starbucks boom, American coffee culture changed rapidly, eventually coming to embrace drip coffee, especially a lighter, more acidic style common in Scandinavia and Japan. Espresso stayed, of course—with the glaring exception of the moka pot, Americans never really stopped looking to Italy for coffee, and even today most of the “serious” espresso machines come from Italian companies.</p>
<p>The moka pot, which in the U.S. had previously had a light following, especially for Italian-Americans, became an object of extreme derision. Coffee purists cried that it couldn’t possibly produce espresso; the moka pot, like the La Pavoni, uses about 1.5 bars of pressure, while a pump espresso machine ideally hits about nine bars. This is, of course, a ridiculous argument; there is no actual definition of espresso, and in any case, the moka pot is at most a second cousin to the espresso machine. There’s no particular reason to compare a steam-driven stovetop machine to a pump-driven electrical device, but coffee people did.</p>

<p>The past few years have changed that, a little bit. Coffee people have softened their stance, and recognized the moka pot for what it is: an entirely different branch of the coffee machine tree, a very old, very clever, and very economical way to make coffee. The previous complaints about the moka pot fell away, and it is increasingly, in coffee circles, given credit for all its strengths.</p>
<p>The nice thing about the moka pot is that it can create a very nice cup of strong coffee, and that the equipment you need is wholly affordable. Moka pots <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/unique-gifts/the-original-bialetti-moka-express">cost about 30 bucks</a>, and by using good coffee and a bit of technique, you can make as good an example of moka pot coffee as anyone in the world.</p>
<p>The rediscovery of that fact by coffee nerds bodes well for the future of the moka pot, despite the troubles of Bialetti, the company. It remains a cool, inexpensive, highly functional example of mid-century modern design. In the same way that the single-cup pour-over cone was rediscovered and prized, sparking a whole new round of sales, maybe the moka pot is due for some revitalization and new trendiness. It seems impossible, or at least undesirable, for such a cool gadget to die.</p>

        <h2>What is Oh My Zsh?</h2>
        <p>Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration.</p>
        <p>Sounds boring. Let's try again.</p>
        <p>Oh My Zsh will not make you a 10x developer...but you may feel like one!</p>
        <p>Once installed, your terminal shell will become the talk of the town or your money back! With each keystroke
          in your command prompt, you'll take advantage of the hundreds of powerful plugins and beautiful themes.
          Strangers will come up to you in cafés and ask you, <em>"that is amazing! are you some sort of genius?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>Finally, you'll begin to get the sort of attention that you have always felt you deserved. ...or maybe you'll
          use the time that you're saving to start flossing more often. 😬</p>

        <h3>Themes</h3>
        <p>We'll admit it. Early in the Oh My Zsh world, we may have gotten a bit too theme happy. We

Wing-in-ground effect refers to the airflow created by the vehicle’s wings and surface of the ocean, which allows seagliders to travel smoothly above the water. This means seagliders can fly low (within one wingspan) over the water on a cushion of air to take advantage of numerous aerodynamic and operational efficiencies.</p><p>Seagliders operate in three modes – float, foil and fly. From the dock, the vehicle first drives on its hull like a traditional boat. As it leaves the harbor area and speeds up, it rises on its hydrofoil, a key maritime technology popularized by America’s Cup sailing competitions. The hydrofoil offers significant wave tolerance and a smooth ride as the seaglider leaves a harbor. Upon reaching open water, the seaglider takes flight, retracting the foil and accelerating up to cruise speed — all while staying within a wingspan of the water’s surface.</p></div><div><div data-w-id="35679a3a-eb31-e823-a0fb-8c491e65b14c"><p>Are seagliders safe for passengers?</p></div><div><p>Seagliders fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Coast Guard and will be regulated to the highest safety standards for passenger carrying vehicles. In addition, seagliders will be certified by Bureau Veritas, a global classification society that provides third-party technical assessments and approves new seagoing vessels such as seagliders. REGENT has already received an Approval in Principle from Bureau Veritas, paving the way for commercial operations for its 12-passenger seaglider, Viceroy.</p><p> In August 2022, REGENT successfully completed a series of first flight tests, using a quarter-scale prototype for the 12-passenger seaglider with flight-qualified avionics components, electrical systems, and software systems. &nbsp;</p></div></div><div><div data-w-id="35679a3a-eb31-e823-a0fb-8c491e65b155"><p>How is the Hawaii Seaglider Initiative gathering input from the community?</p></div><div><p>REGENT and Pacific Current commissioned SMS Research, a leading market research firm based in Honolulu, to look at the economic, environmental, and community benefits and challenges associated with introducing seagliders to Hawai‘i. This initial survey &nbsp;examined the socioeconomic and technical feasibility of establishing an inter-island and intra-island seaglider system. &nbsp;<br>‍<br>The second phase of the feasibility study, &nbsp;led by EKNA Services, a Honolulu-based engineering and construction management firm, will include a detailed analysis of various ports and harbors. The data that we collect may also be incorporated into an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement.</p></div></div><div><div data-w-id="1595ffad-0f0b-3e5a-d66b-ed0e0ee8dac5"><p>Will seaglider travel only be accessibly by wealthy residents and visitors?</p></div><div><p>Seagliders are much less expensive to operate relative to airplanes. This cost reduction means much lower ticket prices than what are currently offered by airline while simultaneously providing a quicker door-to-door travel time.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div data-w-id="35679a3a-eb31-e823-a0fb-8c491e65b171"><p>Are seagliders like the Hawai‘i Superferry?</p></div><div><p>No, seagliders use a different technology than the Hawai‘i Superferry. Seagliders float, foil and fly to travel from one point to another. The Superferry used waterjet propulsion, cruising over the surface of the ocean. &nbsp;</p><p> The Hawai‘i Superferry operated without all of the necessary environmental Impact statements. Although seagliders will be in the air for most of their travel time, there are still many studies that need to be conducted to understand any environmental impact on whales or other marine life and Hawai‘i waters.</p></div></div><div><div data-w-id="35679a3a-eb31-e823-a0fb-8c491e65b17a"><p>What are some concerns that have been expressed about the Hawai‘i seaglider system?</p></div><div><p>A preliminary survey of Hawai‘i residents showed they are concerned that seagliders will only be affordable to the affluent and may result in an increased tax burden on Hawai‘i’s residents. The survey also showed that residents are concerned that seagliders may produce some form of ecological damage either near shore or in the areas surrounding the harbors. Others expressed their concern about how seagliders can potentially impact communities through an increase in visitors. All of these concerns are important to the Hawai‘i Seaglider Initiative, and will be addressed as seagliders move forward in Hawai‘i. We believe seagliders should bring the community together, not divide us. The goal of the Hawai‘i Seaglider Initiative is to move forward with an open heart and mind as a unified community.</p></div></div><div><div data-w-id="35679a3a-eb31-e823-a0fb-8c491e65b183"><p>Who was included in the survey and when was it conducted?</p></div><div><p>SMS Research collected responses to questionnaires from mid-August 2022 until early October 2022 from government leaders, elected officials who would be direct decision-makers or appropriators for transportation services, maritime industry executives, and leaders from environmental and community organizations representing interests that would be directly impacted by the seaglider service. &nbsp; </p><p>In addition, 844 randomly selected State of Hawai‘i residents and 1,544 visitors were surveyed between August 30, 2022 and September 12, 2022. The visitors were qualified by indicating that they traveled for leisure by air, 500 miles or more, in the past five years and have visited Hawai‘i in the past five years. Visitors were classified into either U.S. West (residents of the West Coast or Mountain states) or U.S. East (all other states except Hawai‘i or the U.S. territories). </p></div></div><div><div data-w-id="2d5df2a5-cd04-7101-3358-486e78198020"><p>Will seagliders interfere with marine ecosystems and habitats?</p></div><div><p>We recognize the dangers of introducing a new mode of maritime transportation to Hawai’i’s environment. This is why seagliders are built to the highest regulatory and environmental standards. Seagliders contain a suite of early detection and avoidance systems to ensure that birds, whales, and other marine life is kept safe. Seagliders also offer a zero-emission mode of fast and affordable travel. With transportation making up the majority of Hawai’i’s energy emissions, seagliders represent a real and effective tool to help Hawai’i meet state sustainability goals which will further protect marine ecosystems.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><p><h2>What is a Seaglider? </h2></p><p>A seaglider is an all-electric, passenger-carrying, wing-in-ground-effect vehicle built to service coastal routes, building on real-world-proven tech. </p></div><div><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64a896c8a4d8d06ce5ca43eb/64ac958752d7bf5e39642d86_REGENT%20Technical%20Demonstrator%201.webp" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 90vw, 41vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64a896c8a4d8d06ce5ca43eb/64ac958752d7bf5e39642d86_REGENT%20Technical%20Demonstrator%201-p-500.webp 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/64a896c8a4d8d06ce5ca43eb/64ac958752d7bf5e39642d86_REGENT%20Technical%20Demonstrator%201-p-800.webp 800w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/64a896c8a4d8d06ce5ca43eb/64ac958752d7bf5e39642d86_REGENT%20Technical%20Demonstrator%201-p-1080.webp 1080w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/64a896c8a4d8d06ce5ca43eb/64ac958752d7bf5e39642d86_REGENT%20Technical%20Demonstrator%201-p-1600.webp 1600w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/64a896c8a4d8d06ce5ca43eb/64ac958752d7bf5e39642d86_REGENT%20Technical%20Demonstrator%201-p-2000.webp 2000w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/64a896c8a4d8d06ce5ca43eb/64ac958752d7bf5e39642d86_REGENT%20Technical%20Demonstrator%201-p-2600.webp 2600w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/64a896c8a4d8d06ce5ca43eb/64ac958752d7bf5e39642d86_REGENT%20Technical%20Demonstrator%201.webp 3000w" alt=""></p></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>At the end of September, I returned to— more peaceful parts of Ukraine, let’s say. And a Reddit discussion inspired me to start writing what I expected to be a short blog post.</p><p>The discussion was about new Ruby syntax elements from recent versions, and, as usual, a fair share of participants expressed some variety of displeasure. I don’t care much for “I like it”/”I don’t like it” kind of discussion, yet I frequently find myself hooked by “I don’t see any explanation why this might be a good idea” or “This is absolutely against everything I love in Ruby.”</p><p>While this kind of statement can be—and frequently is—just another way to say “I don’t like it,” my mind perceives it as a challenge: can the reasoning behind the change be understood and explained? What was the design space for solving the problem?</p><p>That’s how the “Useless Ruby sugar” was born: as an attempt to look for a consistent explanation of the changes in the syntax and to analyze whether the changes have deep consequences.</p><blockquote><p>“Syntax sugar” is another liberally used term to mark elements of syntax in a derogatory way, implying that its only effect is saving a few keystrokes at a cost of complicating the language’s logic. The named was chosen as a sign of irony, but I should regretfully acknowledge that some readers took it at a face value (sometimes cheering to “finally saying the truth,” sometimes arguing).</p></blockquote><p>When I started to write “That useless Ruby sugar,” I imagined it as a short blog post made of concise sections (a paragraph or two each), dedicated to several latest language changes and investigating where they came from, how they were designed, and how they change the perception of the code.</p><p><strong>The intention was not to “defend” some particular feature or the language as a whole.</strong><span> I wanted to honestly share my </span><em>optics</em><span>, my way of looking at means of expression and integrating them into my mental model.</span></p><p>I decided that each of the chosen syntax features (anonymous block parameters, pattern matching, argument forwarding, and so on) can be covered from the same angles, from reasons of its introduction to consequences and changes in code style, and compared to similar designs in other programming languages.</p><p><span>A “small post” grew into “a very large post,” then into a series of posts published over two months (one of the topics—pattern matching—fractally grew into </span><a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-10-20-syntax-sugar2-pattern-matching.html" rel="">three</a><span> </span><a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-10-27-syntax-sugar2-pattern-matching-cont.html" rel="">consecutive</a><span> </span><a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-11-03-syntax-sugar2-pattern-matching-fin.html" rel="">posts</a><span> on itself— and, trust me, I am praying that the current text wouldn’t turn out too long for a singular final article!)</span></p><p>Despite the appalling underestimation of the amount of writing which cost me some two months of weekly posts, I kinda enjoyed doing it. And it seems to have found its share of grateful and attentive readers (thank you!). For me, it turned out not to be about particular language features. And, to some extent, not even about the particular language (which, though, became a load-bearing pillar of the argument).</p><p><span>I started with a slightly expanded version of “rules of thumb” for understanding, guessing, and memorizing language behaviors I frequently share with colleagues. Eventually, the texts grew into some </span><strong>“thought framework”: the way of looking at the inevitable change of a living language</strong><span>—its cause and the design space of possible implementations, its consequences, and effects.</span></p><p>The essential property of this framework is considering the programming language as a tool for writing and reading first and foremost. I always attempt to see the driving forces behind its evolution as an intention to formulate the intention better.</p><p><span>It is obviously not the only way of looking at programming languages, but it seems to be interesting and insightful enough for the series to have some modest success and a healthy dose of comments. The individual articles frequently caused interesting cross-language discussions, where most participants were not native to Ruby</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-140943987" href="https://zverok.substack.com/p/the-end-of-useless-ruby-sugar-on#footnote-1-140943987" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>.</span></p><p>While amounting to a small book already, the series has a pretty narrow premise: just one way of looking at just a few changes of just one language in a vast universe of them. Still, I think two of the main “driving forces” are important and relevant not only for Ruby.</p><p><span>The first, which I think is common for many mainstream languages and styles, is the </span><strong>tectonic shift from the “classic OO” style</strong><span> of structuring programs (and envisioning them!) to the “small immutable objects + functional algorithms” style. Obviously, it is not the most breaking news (entire languages of Go and Rust that can already be considered mainstream are built on foundations that are quite far from the “classic OO”); it is still interesting to see how the established languages adapt.</span></p><p><span>The second force of the change is more perpetual: it is a </span><strong>natural expansion of language’s—any language’s—thesaurus</strong><span> in response to more and more things previously non-trivial and complicated becoming everyday ones. Concepts that used to require explanation and education become something that you understand from a single mention and want to be expressed in one word. Some decades ago, not every programming language could handle strings properly (Unicode strings, even less so). Today, things like lambdas, sum types, or pattern matching are almost must-haves for expressing everyday thoughts. The baseline shifts constantly.</span></p><p><span>A lot of changes I discussed in the context of Ruby are more universal: most widely used languages continue to adjust as thinking tools to the changing landscape of </span><em>what we are thinking about</em><span>. It seems as universal as a pushback from some part of every language’s community: a pushback from those whose thought process is performed at other layers and who believe that the fabric of the language should stay stable to not “distract” from the materialization of already formed thoughts with the new features.</span></p><p>And every language’s evolution is probably a compromise between those two forces.</p><p>While I hope that some of my observations and conclusions in the series were curious for a broader audience, I am still thinking and writing in and about Ruby.</p><p>One may say that Ruby is my “lens” for looking at problems, both on the pragmatic layers (writing code to understand something) and on the meta-/philosophical layer of looking at how the language adjusts to the changing world to understand the world better.</p><p><span>The important thing about Ruby, which is its curse and blessing, is </span><strong>it isn’t an interesting language</strong><span>. There is no particular “shtick” or wittily-named concept everybody tries to imitate in other languages (well, I think it was part of Ruby’s doing to introduce the functional iterators like </span><code>map</code><span> in the mainstream, but they weren’t invented here).</span></p><p>I believe the premise of the language is something along the lines of “take the modern ideas and put them together with a reasonably minimal number of base concepts, as clearly and expressively as possible without becoming esoteric.”</p><p><em>And I think the reputation of being “weird and whimsical” that the language earned in the 2000s, both amongst its fans and haters, tells more about the state of the industry at that point. An industry where the desire to write in one line what “should’ve” required a class and a package and several methods and initializations and type definitions— when that desire alone made a developer look “unserious.”</em></p><p>In many aspects, Ruby (with its Smalltalk-inspired internal “almost everything is just objects exchanging messages”) achieved remarkable clarity and consistency from a very small set of core concepts—yet not as small to become a “language constructor” instead of a language.</p><p><span>Through the years, it managed to continue staying </span><em>reasonably modern</em><span> without losing the internal consistency and discoverability (though, of course, some Rubyists would have strong dissenting opinions: I think one of the commentators of the series said something along the lines of “I love Ruby but nothing good happened since 2.0”—with 2.0 being ten years old).</span></p><p>Of course, not all of the language’s initial design decisions and accumulated weight is “optimal” or provably best.</p><p>I can list a lot of things I am personally not a big fan of. An early draft of this article had a planned section for some of them— But I recently developed an irrational fear of fractally expanding articles! Though, to name a few:</p><ul><li><p><span>textual </span><code>require</code><span>s and module system could’ve been much cleaner, and I don’t believe “fixing” it with an elaborate constant auto-loading mechanism was the best way forward;</span></p></li><li><p><span>while “code blocks” aka </span><code>Proc</code><span> were a witty way to introduce higher-level functions, the current situation with “callable objects” in Ruby (non-fist-class </span><code>Method</code><span> objects, semi-convention of </span><code>call</code><span> method handling) makes it less powerful than it might’ve been;</span></p></li><li><p><span>the uneven and confusingly supported standard library (my favorite example is </span><code>Date</code><span>/</span><code>Time</code><span> types situation, with </span><code>Time</code><span> being a core object, </span><code>Date</code><span> being part of the standard library mostly dedicated to scientific calculations and many small discrepancies between them);</span></p></li><li><p>(I can continue).</p></li></ul><p><span>The best things are still a reasonably small core of concepts, with the development team working hard to “factorize” any new feature into those concepts, and the flexible syntax that is instrumental for making the core small (like an ability to call a method without parentheses makes </span><code>foo.bar</code><span> attribute-like syntax possible and removing a need to have separate “method” and “property”/”getter” concepts).</span></p><p><span>Those characteristics make Ruby—still—an incredible fit for developing </span><em>domain-specific thesauri</em><span>: new, task-specific parts of the language that would integrate naturally with its rest and would make “thinking in the domain” much easier. I’d distinguish that from a concept of a “domain-specific language,” which frequently implies a </span><em>new</em><span> system of expression, with its logic not necessarily aligned with the implementation language.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>I think Rails was/is a great demonstration of how natural Ruby is in development of that “domain-specific thesaurus.” I just wish sometimes that it would be taken as an example/inspiration for development of many others. Instead, Rails became </span><em>the</em><span> Ruby shtick, and its popularity at some point put Ruby in the domain of “development of support of big systems,” with its reputation and evolution being severely affected by those new circumstances.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Still, for me, Ruby stays a great </span><em>modeling clay</em><span> for experimenting with things and investigating new ideas.</span></p><p><em><strong>Please stop here for a moment.</strong><span> This is your regular mid-text reminder that I am a living person from Ukraine, and a bit of useful related information.</span></em></p><p><em><strong>On the news.</strong><span> Usually, I put “one news item” here. Yet, honestly. It is hard to choose one that happened since my </span><a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-12-28-advent-of-changelog-fin.html" rel="">last post</a><span>. We had a lot happening. A prominent young poet </span><a href="https://twitter.com/PenUkraine/status/1744075793855029721" rel="">was killed</a><span> on the front line (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/zverok/status/1744416917392179531" rel="">here, I translated</a><span> some of his poems). Massive missile/drone </span><a href="https://twitter.com/United24media/status/1742224719011594673" rel="">bombardment</a><span> around the New Year, including in my home city (which has continued to be regularly shelled since; say, last week, a missile </span><a href="https://twitter.com/FeministsUa/status/1747695174602420381" rel="">hit</a><span> a private gynecological clinic, and the week before that—a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/United24media/status/1745340529699696643" rel="">hotel</a><span> with foreign journalists). That’s not </span><a href="https://twitter.com/den_kazansky/status/1743684511320133876" rel="">even</a><span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/United24media/status/1747896573990781438" rel="">mentioning</a><span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/United24media/status/1748633966255686091" rel="">everyday</a><span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/United24media/status/1748680827620270192" rel="">attacks</a><span> on civilians in the smaller cities nearer to the front lines. I wonder how much of this gets in the mainstream media of my reader’s countries.</span></em></p><p><em><strong>One piece of context.</strong><span> Today (Jan 20, the day I am finishing this post) is </span><a href="https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1748647821803245895" rel="">Memorial Day of Defenders of Donetsk Airport</a><span>. For 242 days, they defended the airport, which disrupted Russia’s plan to transfer forces through it and prevented more Ukrainian territory from being lost in 2014-2015. Yeah, Russia was waging its war then, already.</span></em></p><p><em><strong>One plea.</strong><span> If you are in the US, please call your representative! In DC, you can also join the </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ukrainerallydc" rel="">Ukraine Rally</a><span>, even if for a small amount of time.</span></em></p><p><em><strong>One fundraiser.</strong><span> You can donate to the </span><a href="https://www.ambulanssi.org/en" rel="">Ambulances for UA</a><span> initiative, which buys ambulance vehicles to serve on evacuation missions near the front lines.</span></em></p><p>While the series, as it was invented, is finished, there are a lot of interesting things that are left to think about, at least for me. Maybe some of those things would turn into future articles!</p><p><span>One thinking direction is diving deeper into the “code as readable text” consequences: I think I have some interesting angles on the (arguably aged and trivial) comparison—from the “software project as a magazine” metaphor (slightly touched in the </span><a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-12-01-syntax-sugar5-endless-methods.html" rel="">last</a><span> post) to what does it mean to think about a “page of code” (repeated motive of the series), or what would be a modern take on the old idea of “literate programming” with our current knowledge.</span></p><p>Another promising direction is juxtaposing design decisions made by several different programming languages in the same area: after doing it for those few syntax features I covered, I now believe it is a powerful tool for understanding some programming concepts, their design space, and the choices and sacrifices some particular language makes to adopt them.</p><p>And in general, I think a lot about the concept of “language intuitions” and other semi-conscious forces that make us consider some code “good” or “bad,” choose approaches and methods of solving problems, and change our views over time. Trying to find out why we have those intuitions and persuasions, as well as expose, challenge, and formalize them, seems like an interesting topic. (Though, arguably, less “marketable” than “just write software my way and you’ll be good, period.”)</p><p>After all, it is not a language study; it is the study of how we think and write. Or at least that’s what my poet’s mind tells me.</p><p>“Intuition” is an important word for me in the context of programming language understanding (as if somebody hasn’t noticed yet!). As I stated in the intro article of the series:</p><blockquote><p><span>I believe a well-designed, consistent language imposes a lot of implicit </span><em>intuitive</em><span> knowledge about “how things are typically done, what this combination of elements might mean, what this particular name is related to,” and alike. Acquiring those intuitions creates </span><em>fluency</em><span> in reading and writing the code that follows them.</span></p></blockquote><p>Naturally, “Ruby Intuitions” became the name of the book I planned to write in 2022.</p><p>Writing the book on the language that tries to expose this implicit knowledge of Ruby and reflect upon it seemed like a good idea. Still seems, actually. Yet the idea of the book became something akin to my “big white whale”: something that I need a lot of luck, time, focus, and experience to work on, and well— it looks like the time for it hasn’t come yet!</p><p>But, while working on the series of articles, I had an idea for another, simpler (hopefully!) book, which would allow me to gather into one text years of my work on understanding the language, documenting it, and observing its change.</p><p><span>The title I came up with was just “Ruby Evolution,” and currently, in my head, it looks like a reasonable cross-over between my </span><a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/" rel="">Ruby Changes</a><span> site and essays like this “Ruby Sugar” series, taken over the span of Ruby’s lifetime: an orderly discussion of the most notable changes by versions/topics, the reasons behind them, and a reflection on how it changed the language.</span></p><p>I have a hope that a book like this might be of interest both for Rubyists and for those from other language communities, in a general “history of ideas” context.</p><p>Currently, I am in the early stages of playing with the idea and drafting a table of contents. But I wonder if there would be some interest in such a book?</p><p>In the meantime, I’ll be writing on other topics that will catch my curiosity, more or less related to Ruby, or at least writing code in general.</p><p><em><strong><span>You can subscribe to my </span><a href="https://zverok.substack.com/" rel="">Substack</a><span>, or follow me on </span><a href="https://twitter.com/zverok" rel="">Twitter</a><span>.</span></strong></em></p><p><strong><span>Thank you for reading.

<p>Well, the level of data forgery is pathetically amateurish and excessive. So much that we could only include a fraction of it into this article, you will have to search <strong>Ken Anderson</strong>, <strong>Bill Hahn</strong> and other protagonists on PubPeer to see how bad it all really is. In fact, it is worse, because we only see the tiny tip of the fraud iceberg –  image data duplications, the last resort of a failed scientist after every other trick failed to provdie the desired result. Billions of dollars were burned for this cancerous trash science, but it made many academic careers, some got very rich, and entire dynasties established themselves at Dana Farber. </p>



<p>None of Dana Farber researchers mentioned in this article replied when asked to comment on their PubPeer records.</p>

<h2>Dana-Farberications at Harvard University</h2>



<h2>By Sholto David</h2>



<p>As the whole world furiously argues over whether the president of Harvard did or didn’t use some quotation marks in the right place, scientists at the affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) must breathe a sigh of relief, no one has bothered to critically read their research in years! Far worse skeletons than plagiarism lurk in the archives…</p>



<h2>Laurie H. Glimcher</h2>



<p>Starting with <strong>Laurie H. Glimcher</strong>, who is the President and CEO of the DFCI. No doubt Laurie built her career on papers like this one, in <em>Nature Immunology</em> (2003), which includes some impressive contributions to art, but perhaps not to science.</p>



<p>Neal N. Iwakoshi, Ann-Hwee Lee, Prasanth Vallabhajosyula, Kevin L. Otipoby, Klaus Rajewsky, Laurie H. Glimcher <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A52B423E7F819C3E78182A846BD4B3">Plasma cell differentiation and the unfolded protein response intersect at the transcription factor XBP-1</a> <em>Nature Immunology</em> (2003) doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ni907">10.1038/ni907</a></p>

<p>Maybe the coauthor <strong>Klaus Rajewsky</strong> could issue a correction blaming the updated western blot hardware this time (as opposed to “<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)30502-5">updated FlowJo software</a>“).</p>


		
		


<p>Laurie has a curious attitude to correcting her work, although she has replied to one<em> </em>of my less critical <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/323B271C29C74106972B9C28C719BC">comments</a>, she neglected to respond to the above issue (despite prompting); and for the following duplicated flow cytometry plots, she provided this dismissive <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A653015B2496DDB8EBAF26EBF25E50">response</a>: </p>



<figure><blockquote><p><em>“You should reach out to Dr. Hidde Ploegh- the first author, Dr. Boaz Tirosh was in his laboratory.”</em></p></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Well Laurie, it’s your paper, if you care about it being correct, you could very well reach out yourself!</strong></p>

</p><figcaption>Described on PubPeer as “more similar than expected” the plots in fact share all of the datapoints, at least one must be wrong.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Laurie co-authored several papers with <strong><a href="https://forbetterscience.com/tag/claudio-hetz/">Claudio Hetz</a></strong>. This <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02682-5">“star neuroscientist”</a> was investigated by his university, which released a damning report, accusing Hetz of recklessness, negligence, and a problematic attitude to research ethics. Hetz simply expressed regret that he didn’t have access to a better version of Photoshop to more convincingly manipulate his images.</p>

<p>In February 2020 Laurie claimed on PubPeer that she had not been made aware of what happened with <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/29AAEBE60566320997C264E9F83048#5">Hetz’s papers</a> (perhaps she should subscribe to <em>For Better Science </em>email alerts!). In any case this discovery did not prompt her into action, by 2023, only one of the four papers tagged on PubPeer with her and Hetz as co-authors has received a reply from her, and none have been corrected or retracted. For example, this undergraduate level error of miscounted western blot lanes remains in the scientific record, without comment or correction, in the prestigious journal <em>Science</em>, no less:</p>

<p>The above paper has generated a lengthy PubPeer thread, discussing multiple splices in the supplementary figures.</p>



<h2>William C. Hahn (Bill)</h2>



<p>The very next entry on the DFCI <a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/about/leadership">leadership page</a> is Laurie’s deputy, <strong>William C. Hahn</strong> who is the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, as well as a member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. While Laurie has a few troubling papers and a lamentable attitude to rectifying these errors, Bill has a far more impressive <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22William+C.+Hahn%22+OR+%22W+C+Hahn%22">PubPeer record</a>, including 30 search results, with eighteen pertaining to problematic images. Bill is the former postdoc of <strong><a href="https://forbetterscience.com/tag/bob-weinberg/">Robert Weinberg</a></strong>, owner of an impressive <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Robert+A.+Weinberg%22+OR+%22R+A+Weinberg%22">PubPeer record</a> too.</p>

<p>I would encourage anyone interested to look carefully at the blots, the edges very clearly show that these are <strong>not</strong> merely bands with similar shapes, but <em>the same bands</em> copied and pasted.</p>

<p>The stench of the sacked MIT professor <strong><a href="https://forbetterscience.com/tag/david-sabatini/">David M. Sabatini</a></strong> is never far from these discussions. Bill co-authored a 2006 paper in <em>Cell</em> with Sabatini, and also with MIT’s <strong>Eric Lander</strong>, who was previously Joe Biden’s top science adviser, but <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2022/02/11/schneider-shorts-11-02-2022-a-deeply-caring-person/#lander">resigned</a> following reports of bullying and misogyny.</p>

<p>But don’t rush to alert Roche, their former Global Head of Pharma Research and Early Development was <strong><a href="https://forbetterscience.com/tag/john-reed/">John C Reed</a></strong>, who was previously at Sanofi, and is now at Johnson &amp; Johnson. Good to know that in Big Pharma research is in such safe hands.</p>

<p>And finally for Bill, another paper in <em>Nature</em>, with Bob Weinberg, containing multiple splices, and a mirrored band (I also think the migration of the Large-T bands seems unusual). This paper has over 3000 citations… So probably nothing urgent here for <em>Nature </em>to address?</p>

<h2>Irene M. Ghobrial</h2>



<p>Moving on to <strong>Irene M. Ghobrial</strong>, who is the Senior Vice President for Experimental Medicine at DFCI. Irene works on multiple myeloma, frequently publishing with her DFCI colleagues <strong>Kenneth C. Anderson</strong>, <strong>Nikhil C. Munshi</strong>, <strong>Teru Hideshima</strong>, <strong>Ruben Carrasco</strong>, and <strong>Yu-Tzu Tai</strong>.</p>



<p>What kind of research has elevated Irene to her current position? </p>



<p>In 2012 this epic fail was published, Irene gained ethical approval to aspirate bone marrow from cancer patients and healthy volunteers, but Figure 1 includes three obvious duplications.</p>

</p><figcaption>Two further overlapping areas.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Wouldn’t the volunteers be furious after undergoing such an invasive procedure? Can the data from a paper like this ever be rehabilitated?</p>



<p>Just like hapless Chinese papermills, Harvard scientists struggle with images of crystal violet stained cells. Perhaps this method is just cursed?</p>

<p>Another blunder in troublesome migration and invasion experiments was published with <strong>John Crown</strong>, an Irish politician and member of the 24th Seanad at the time this paper was submitted.</p>

<p>I am also concerned about images of mice. In the figure below, a group of mice has made a knight move across the page, and transitioned between groups.  Thinking about what Irene’s team may have wished to demonstrate (lack of cancer spread in their favoured group) this appears to be a very <em>convenient</em> error.</p>

<p>Another problematic murine figure is shown below. This appears to be nearly entirely fabricated by taking repeated scans of a few mice and labelling them as showing a range of different timepoints and treatment conditions. Look carefully at the positions of the tail, feet, fur, and elements of noise around the mice.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, Irene frequently publishes with <strong>Kenneth C. Anderson</strong> (you may have noticed above). Ken is also a senior DFCI researcher. Perhaps we can imagine them as Ken and Barbie?</p>

Perhaps Ken has rotten luck in choosing his collaborators? Here Ken teamed up with the previously mentioned Ron DePinho and Ruben Carrasco for an artistic interpretation of western blotting his CEO Laurie might be impressed by. </p>

<p>Around 2010 Ken retracted three papers in quick succession (<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/469D3C5EA2D372518F3CA521BD3BC0">Okawa et al 2008</a>, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/72BC28B138DAC73B48F6758860E76F">Tai et al 2009</a>, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8370A8805B9E2535FAF9E29B5D3FF1">Gatt et al 2010</a>), apparently because the cell lines were mixed up, and to be fair, it does seem like mixing things up is rather in Ken’s wheelhouse, but it does leave one wondering… Was an investigation into the affair ever held? Or were the retractions prompted by secret investigation? How much research funding can you waste on these blunders at DFCI without any consequences or any public comment?</p>



<p><strong>In conclusion:</strong> a swathe of research coming out of DFCI authored by the most senior researchers and managers appears to be hopelessly corrupt with errors that are obvious from just a cursory reading the papers.<strong> </strong></p>



<p><strong>Imagine what mistakes might be found in the raw data if anyone was <em>allowed</em> to look!</strong></p>



<p>As it happened to the Dean of Harvard Medical School, <strong><a href="https://forbetterscience.com/tag/george-q-daley/">George Q Daley</a></strong>:</p>

First author and Lopez-Otin’s student Clara Soria-Valles caused Daley even more trouble: her next groundbreaking paper was meant to be already published, but…</p>

<p>As time marches on, methods have become more “genomical”, and in a lot of ways, harder to scrutinize. I had a go at replicating some of the gene expression analysis in Irene’s papers (for example, see <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9E197B936872497ED77BB37FC49AEA">here</a>), and it doesn’t look hopeful, but it isn’t worth anyone’s time to write such comments if obvious errors in images are going to be left unmolested for years at a time.</p>



<p>In 2017, DFCI’s own future Nobel Prize winner <strong>William G. Kaelin Jr</strong> wrote an opinion piece in <em>Nature</em>, lamenting the proliferation of papers focusing on “impact” rather than robustness, burying weak data in supplements, cherry picking, and other poor practices, he didn’t mention fraud, although there are still some interesting quotes.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“The main question when reviewing a paper should be whether its<br>conclusions are likely to be correct, not whether it would be important<br>if it were true. Real advances are built with bricks, not straw. “</p><cite>William G. Kaelin Jr <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/545387a">Nature</a></em> (2017)</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>What exactly is the building material of choice at DFCI?</p>

<p>Credit should go to the anonymous and named commentors on PubPeer, Bill and Ken’s papers have been annotated over the last ten years, I presume frequently by Clare Francis. Some of the more recent comment’s especially on Irene’s papers were left by me, sometimes with the help of ImageTwin.ai. Other known contributors include Cheshire, and Elisabeth Bik. Written with some help from Leonid.</p>
