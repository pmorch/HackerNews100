            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2025/06/06/a-look-at-cloudflares-ai-coded-oauth-library/">https://neilmadden.blog/2025/06/06/a-look-at-cloudflares-ai-coded-oauth-library/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44215667">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I decided today to take a look at <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider">CloudFlare’s new OAuth provider library</a>, which they apparently coded almost entirely with Anthropic’s Claude LLM:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>This library (including the schema documentation) was largely written with the help of&nbsp;<a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a>, the AI model by Anthropic. Claude’s output was thoroughly reviewed by Cloudflare engineers with careful attention paid to security and compliance with standards. Many improvements were made on the initial output, mostly again by prompting Claude (and reviewing the results). Check out the commit history to see how Claude was prompted and what code it produced.</p><p>[…]</p></div>



<p>To emphasize,&nbsp;<strong>this is not “vibe coded”</strong>. Every line was thoroughly reviewed and cross-referenced with relevant RFCs, by security experts with previous experience with those RFCs. I was&nbsp;<em>trying</em>&nbsp;to validate my skepticism. I ended up proving myself wrong.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I have done a fair amount of LLM-assisted “agentic” coding of this sort recently myself. I’m also an expert in OAuth, having written <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/api-security-in-action">API Security in Action</a>, been on the OAuth Working Group at the IETF for years, and previously been the tech lead and then security architect for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ForgeRock">leading OAuth provider</a>. (I also have a PhD in AI from an <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/research/agents-lab.aspx">intelligent agents group</a>, but that predates the current machine learning craze). So I was super interested to see what it had produced, so I took a look while sitting in some meetings today. Disclaimer: I’ve only had a brief look and raised a few bugs, not given it a full review.</p>



<p>Initially, I was fairly impressed by the code. The code is all in one file, which is common from my experience from LLM coding, but it’s fairly well structured without too many of the useless comments that LLMs love to sprinkle over a codebase, and some actual classes and higher-level organisation. </p>



<p>There are some tests, and they are OK, but they are woefully inadequate for what I would expect of a critical auth service. Testing every MUST and MUST NOT in the spec is a bare minimum, not to mention as many abuse cases as you can think of, but none of that is here from what I can see: just basic functionality tests. (From a cursory look at the code, I’d say there are probably quite a few missing MUST checks, particularly around validating parameters, which is pretty light in the current implementation).</p>



<p>The first thing that stuck out for me was what I like to call “YOLO CORS”, and is not that unusual to see: setting CORS headers that effectively disable the same origin policy almost entirely for all origins:</p>


<div><pre title="">private addCorsHeaders(response: Response, request: Request): Response {
    // Get the Origin header from the request
    const origin = request.headers.get('Origin');

    // If there's no Origin header, return the original response
    if (!origin) {
      return response;
    }

    // Create a new response that copies all properties from the original response
    // This makes the response mutable so we can modify its headers
    const newResponse = new Response(response.body, response);

    // Add CORS headers
    newResponse.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', origin);
    newResponse.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', '*');
    // Include Authorization explicitly since it's not included in * for security reasons
    newResponse.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Authorization, *');
    newResponse.headers.set('Access-Control-Max-Age', '86400'); // 24 hours

    return newResponse;
  }
</pre></div>


<p>There are cases where this kind of thing is OK, and I haven’t looked in detail at why they’ve done this, but it looks really suspicious to me. You should almost never need to do this. In this case, <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/commit/16ed01f825d5bcc2fa8862f2da719495c92963c3">the commit log</a> reveals that it was the humans that decided on this approach, not the LLM. They haven’t enabled credentials at least, so <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors#server-generated-acao-header-from-client-specified-origin-header">the sorts of problems this usually results in</a> probably don’t apply.</p>



<p>Talking of headers, there is a distinct lack of <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Headers_Cheat_Sheet.html">standard security headers</a> in the responses produced. Many of these don’t apply to APIs, but some do (and often in surprising ways). For example, in my book I show how to exploit an XSS vulnerability against a JSON API: just because you’re returning well-formed JSON doesn’t mean that’s how a browser will interpret it. I’m not familiar with CloudFlare Workers, so maybe it adds some of these for you, but I’d expect at least an<code> X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</code> header and HTTP Strict Transport Security to protect the bearer tokens being used.</p>



<p>There are some odd choices in the code, and things that lead me to believe that the people involved are not actually familiar with the OAuth specs at all. For example, <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/commit/a103ed06d94cc097db0744da36618153e1f27789">this commit adds support for public clients</a>, but does so by implementing the deprecated “implicit” grant (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#name-removal-of-the-oauth-20-imp">removed in OAuth 2.1</a>). This is absolutely not needed to support public clients, especially when the rest of the code implements PKCE and relaxes CORS anyway. The commit message suggests that they didn’t know what was needed to support public clients and so asked Claude and it suggested the implicit grant. The implicit grant is hidden behind a feature flag, but that flag is only checked in an entirely optional helper method for parsing the request, not at the point of token issuance.</p>



<p>Another hint that this is not written by people familiar with OAuth is that they have <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/issues/41">implemented Basic auth support incorrectly</a>. This is a classic bug in OAuth provider implementations because people (and LLMs, apparently) assume that it is just vanilla Basic auth, but OAuth adds a twist of URL-encoding everything first (because charsets are a mess). Likewise, the code has a secondary bug if you have a colon in the client secret (allowed by the spec). I don’t think either of these are issues for this specific implementation, because it always generates client IDs and secrets and so can control the format, but I haven’t looked in detail.</p>



<p>A more serious bug is that the code that generates token IDs is not sound: <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/issues/42">it generates biased output</a>. This is a classic bug when people naively try to generate random strings, and the <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/commit/3b2ae809e9256d292079bb15ea9fe49439a0779c">LLM spat it out in the very first commit </a>as far as I can see. I don’t think it’s exploitable: it reduces the entropy of the tokens, but not far enough to be brute-forceable. But it somewhat gives the lie to the idea that experienced security professionals reviewed every line of AI-generated code. If they did and they missed this, then they were way too trusting of the LLM’s competence. (I don’t think they did: according to the commit history, there were 21 commits directly to main on the first day from one developer, no sign of any code review at all).</p>



<p>I had a brief look at the encryption implementation for the token store. I mostly like the design! It’s quite smart. From the commit messages, we can see that the design came from the human engineers, but I was quite impressed by the implementation. It’s worth <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/commit/adcbb5de9c24f5b6a7dbea2e0a313a87c304d9bb">reproducing the commit message</a> from this work here, which shows the engineer’s interactions with Claude to get the desired code implemented:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Ask Claude to store the props encrypted.</p>



<p>prompt: I would like to encrypt the `props` stored in `Grant` and `Token` records. It should be encrypted such that you need a valid token to decrypt. This is a bit tricky since there are multiple valid tokens over time: there’s the authorization code, the refresh tokens (which rotate), and individual access tokens. We don’t want to repeatedly re-encrypt `props`. Instead, we should encrypt in once, with a symmetric key, and then we should store that key “wrapped” for each token, while the token is valid. Please use WebCrypto to implement all cryptography. </p>



<p>Claude started on the wrong track making me realize I forgot an important design consideration: </p>



<p>prompt: One thing I forgot to note: The `listUserGrants()` helper function will no longer be able to return the `props`, since it doesn’t have any token with which to decript it. That’s OK: `props` need only be delivered to the app upon an authorized API request. We should actually change `listUserGrants()` to make it return a narrower representation of a grant. Right now it returns the entire grant record from storage, but we really only need it to return `id`, `clientId`, `userId`, `scope`, `metadata`, and `createdAt`. We don’t need to return any of the token IDs or code challenge information. </p>



<p>Claude produced beautiful code with one big flaw. </p>



<p>prompt: There’s a security flaw in the way you wrap keys for tokens: You used a SHA-256 hash of the token as the key material for the wrapping. However, SHA-256 is also how we compute “token IDs”. With this construction, someone would be able to unwrap the keys using only the token ID, which is stored alongside the wrapped keys, hence all keys can be trivially unwrapped. To fix this, we need to compute the hash differently when computing the key material for wrapping, in such a way that it’s not possible to derive the key material from the token ID. </p>



<p>Claude initially tried to solve this by switching to using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations to derive the key material. </p>



<p>prompt: PDKDF2 with 100000 iterations would be very expensive. This would be important if the input were a low-entropy password, but is not necessary for high-entropy input. Instead of PBKDF2, let’s use a SHA-256 HMAC, with a static HMAC key (which essentially acts as the “salt”). </p>



<p>Claude produced code that used a string “OAUTH_PROVIDER_WRAPPING_KEY_HMAC_v1” as the HMAC key. </p>



<p>prompt: This looks pretty good, but for performance, let’s define WRAPPING_KEY_HMAC_KEY as a 32-byte array, so that it doesn’t have to be encoded or hashed down to the right size (as HMAC would do for larger keys). Here are 32 bytes of hex which I have chosen randomly, to use as the HMAC key: 22 7e 26 86 8d f1 e1 6d 80 70 ea 17 97 5b 47 a6 82 18 fa 87 28 ae de 85 b5 1d 4a d9 96 ca ca 43</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(NB: using a hard-coded “key” here is fine: it’s essentially HKDF-Extract with a fixed random salt, which is fine and dandy for this use-case. The security property we’re looking for here is that the two uses are <em>independent random oracles</em>, for which this is a decent design. I would maybe use the same approach for generating the token ID too, with a different salt, but that’s a minor tweak).</p>



<p>What this interaction shows is how much knowledge you need to bring when you interact with an LLM. The “one big flaw” Claude produced in the middle would probably not have been spotted by someone less experienced with crypto code than this engineer obviously is. And likewise, many people would probably not have questioned the weird choice to move to PBKDF2 as a response: LLMs really do not “reason” in any real way.</p>



<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>As a first cut of an OAuth library, it’s not bad, but I wouldn’t really recommend it for use <em>yet</em>. In my experience, it is very hard to build a correct and <strong>secure</strong> OAuth provider implementation, and it deserves way more time and attention than has clearly gone into this one (yet). IMO, it’s not an appropriate domain for testing out an LLM. At ForgeRock, we had <em>hundreds</em> of security bugs in our OAuth implementation, and that was despite having <em>100s of thousands</em> of automated tests run on every commit, threat modelling, top-flight SAST/DAST, and extremely careful security review by experts. The idea that you can get an LLM to knock one up for you is not serious.</p>



<p>The commit history of this project is absolutely fascinating. The engineers clearly had a good idea of many aspects of the design, and the LLM was tightly controlled and produced decent code. (LLMs are absolutely good at coding in this manner). But it still tried to do some stupid stuff, some of which were caught by the engineers, some were not. I’m sure some are still in there. Is this worse than if a human had done it? Probably not. Many of these same mistakes can be found in popular Stack Overflow answers, which is probably where Claude learnt them from too. But I know many engineers who would have done a better job, because they are extremely diligent. Code like this needs careful attention. Details matter. Yes, this does come across as a bit “vibe-coded”, despite what the README says, but so does a lot of code I see written by humans. LLM or not, we have to give a shit.</p>



<p>What I am taking away from my experience with LLMs, and from reviewing this project is this: you need to have a clear idea in your head of the kind of code you’re expecting the LLM to produce to be able to judge whether it did a good job. Often, to really know what that looks like, and engage your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">“System 2” thinking</a> (so you’re not just accepting what’s in front of you as the best way to do things), you need to have built one yourself first. For trivial things where I don’t really care how it’s done, then sure, I’m happy to let an LLM do whatever it likes. But for important things, like <em>my fucking auth system</em>, I’d much rather do it myself and be sure that I <em>really</em> thought about it.</p>

<p>6th June 2025</p>



<p>I presented an invited keynote at the <a href="https://www.ai.engineer/">AI Engineer World’s Fair</a> in San Francisco this week. This is my third time speaking at the event—here are my talks from <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/17/open-questions/">October 2023</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/27/ai-worlds-fair/">June 2024</a>. My topic this time was “The last six months in LLMs”—originally planned as the last year, but so much has happened that I had to reduce my scope!</p>

With hindsight that was foolish—the space has been accelerating to the point that even covering the last six months is a tall order!</p>
<p>Thankfully almost all of the noteworthy models we are using today were released within the last six months. I’ve counted over 30 models from that time period that are significant enough that people working in this space should at least be aware of them.</p>
<p>With so many great models out there, the classic problem remains how to evaluate them and figure out which ones work best.</p>
<p>There are plenty of benchmarks full of numbers. I don’t get much value out of those numbers.</p>
<p>There are leaderboards, but I’ve been <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/30/criticism-of-the-chatbot-arena/">losing some trust</a> in those recently.</p>
<p>Everyone needs their own benchmark. So I’ve been increasingly leaning on my own, which started as a joke but is beginning to show itself to actually be a little bit useful!</p>

<p>I’m running this against text output LLMs. They shouldn’t be able to draw anything at all.</p>
<p>But they can generate code... and SVG is code.</p>
<p>This is also an unreasonably difficult test for them. Drawing bicycles is really hard! Try it yourself now, without a photo: most people find it difficult to remember the exact orientation of the frame.</p>
<p>Pelicans are glorious birds but they’re also pretty difficult to draw. </p>
<p>Most importantly: <em>pelicans can’t ride bicycles</em>. They’re the wrong shape!</p>

It’s 24B which means I can run it in my laptop using less than 20GB of RAM, leaving enough for me to run Firefox and VS Code at the same time!</p>
<p>Notably, Mistral claimed that it performed similar to Llama 3.3 70B. That’s the model that Meta said was as capable as their 405B model. This means we have dropped from 405B to 70B to 24B while mostly retaining the same capabilities!</p>
<p>I had a successful flight where I was using Mistral Small for half the flight... and then my laptop battery ran out, because it turns out these things burn a lot of electricity.</p>
<p>If you lost interest in local models—like I did eight months ago—it’s worth paying attention to them again. They’ve got good now!</p>

They had <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/13/launching-chatgpt-images/">a single hour</a> where they signed up a million new accounts, as this thing kept on going viral again and again and again.</p>
<p>I took a photo of my dog, Cleo, and told it to dress her in a pelican costume, obviously.</p>
<p>But look at what it did—it added a big, ugly sign in the background saying Half Moon Bay.</p>
<p>I didn’t ask for that. My artistic vision has been completely compromised!</p>

<p>It was also telling people that they should get off their meds. This was a genuine problem!</p>
<p>To OpenAI’s credit they rolled out a patch, then rolled back the entire model and published a <a href="https://openai.com/index/expanding-on-sycophancy/">fascinating postmortem</a> (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/2/what-we-missed-with-sycophancy/">my notes here</a>) describing what went wrong and changes they are making to avoid similar problems in the future.

<p>There’s this thing I’m calling the <strong>lethal trifecta</strong>,  which is when you have an AI system that has access to private data, and potential exposure to malicious instructions—so other people can trick it into doing things... and there’s a mechanism to exfiltrate stuff.</p>
<p>Combine those three things and people can steal your private data just by getting instructions to steal it into a place that your LLM assistant might be able to read.</p>
<p>Sometimes those three might even be present in a single MCP! The <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/26/github-mcp-exploited/">GitHub MCP expoit</a> from a few weeks ago worked based on that combination.</p>

I thought I would share my experience of maintaining an Android app.

then you will have to work around it, or rewrite your app in Kotlin as well!</li><li>Jetpack Compose, an official Google UI library for Android is

              I was chatting with a fellow web developer recently and made a joke about the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> and
              <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tags, only to discover that he had no idea what I was talking about. They’re a part of web history that’s fallen off the radar and younger developers are
              unlikely to have ever come across them. But for a little while, back in the 90s, they were a big deal.
            </p>
            <figure id="attachment_17882" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17882">
              <a href="#lightbox-p-attachment_17882" title="Zoom in on image" aria-haspopup="dialog" role="button"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://danq.me/_q23u/2020/11/dreamweaver-blink-marquee.png" alt="Macromedia Dreamweaver 3 code editor window showing a <h2> heading wrapped in <marquee> and <blink> tags, for emphasis." width="1024" height="586"></a>
              <figcaption id="caption-attachment-17882">
                Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Dreamweaver">Macromedia Dreamweaver</a>, which embodied the essence of 1990s web design, seemed to treat wrapping
                <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> in <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> as an antipattern.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Invention of the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> element is often credited to <a href="https://montulli.blogspot.com/">Lou Montulli</a>, who wrote pioneering web browser <a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net/">Lynx</a> before being joining Netscape in 1994. <a href="http://www.montulli.org/theoriginofthe%3Cblink%3Etag">He insists that he didn’t write any
              of the code</a> that eventually became the first implementation of <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code>. Instead, he claims: while out at a bar (on the evening he’d first meet his wife!), he
              pointed out that many of the fancy new stylistic elements the other Netscape engineers were proposing wouldn’t work in Lynx, which is a text-only browser. The fanciest conceivable
              effect that would work across both browsers would be making the text flash on and off, he joked. Then another engineer – who he doesn’t identify – pulled a late night hack session and
              added it.
            </p>
            <p>
              And so it was that <a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/old-software/web-browsers/netscape-navigator-2-0">when Netscape Navigator 2.0 was released in 1995</a> it added support for
              the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag. Also animated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format (file)s">GIFs</abbr> and the first inklings of JavaScript, which collectively
              would go on to <em>define</em> the “personal website” experience for years to come. Here’s how you’d use it:
            </p>
            <pre><code>&lt;BLINK&gt;This is my blinking text!&lt;/BLINK&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
              With no attributes, it was clear from the outset that this tag was supposed to be a joke. By the time <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language, version 4">HTML4</abbr> was
              published as a a recommendation two years later, <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/HTML40-plus-blink.dtd">it was <em>documented</em> as being a joke</a>. But the Web of the late 1990s
              saw it used <em>a lot</em>. If you wanted somebody to notice the “latest updates” section on your personal home page, you’d wrap a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag around the title (or,
              if you were a sadist, the entire block).
            </p>
            <figure id="attachment_17890" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17890">

            </figure>
            <p>
              In the same year as Netscape Navigator 2.0 was released, <a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/old-software/web-browsers/internet-explorer-2-0">Microsoft released Internet Explorer
              2.0</a>. At this point, Internet Explorer was still very-much playing catch-up with the features the Netscape team had implemented, but clearly some senior Microsoft engineer took a
              look at the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag, refused to play along with the joke, but had an innovation of their own: the <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tag! It had <a href="http://www.lissaexplains.com/fun3.shtml">a whole suite of attributes</a> to control the scroll direction, speed, and whether it looped or bounced backwards and forwards. While
              <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> encouraged disgusting and inaccessible design as a joke, <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> did it on purpose.
            </p>
            <pre><code>&lt;MARQUEE&gt;Oh my god this still works in most modern browsers!&lt;/MARQUEE&gt;</code></pre>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <marquee>Oh my god this still works in most modern browsers!</marquee>
              </p>
              
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              But here’s the interesting bit: for a while in the late 1990s, it became a somewhat common practice to wrap content that you wanted to emphasise with animation in <em>both</em> a
              <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> and a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tag. That way, the Netscape users would see it flash, the <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> users
              would see it scroll or bounce. Like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code>&lt;MARQUEE&gt;&lt;BLINK&gt;This is my really important message!&lt;/BLINK&gt;&lt;/MARQUEE&gt;</code></pre>
            <figure id="attachment_17887" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17887">
              <a href="#lightbox-p-attachment_17887" title="Zoom in on image" aria-haspopup="dialog" role="button"><img decoding="async" src="https://danq.me/_q23u/2020/11/IE5.gif" alt="Internet Explorer 5 showing a marquee effect." width="640" height="480"></a>
              <figcaption id="caption-attachment-17887">
                Wrap a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> inside a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> and <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> users will see the marquee. Delightful.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              The web has always been built on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">Postel’s Law</a>: a web browser should assume that it won’t understand everything it reads,
              but it should provide a best-effort rendering for the benefit of its user anyway. Ever wondered why the modern <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element is a block rather than a self-closing
              tag? It’s so you can embed <em>within</em> it code that an earlier browser – one that doesn’t understand <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> – can read (a browser’s default state when seeing a
              new element it doesn’t understand is to ignore it and carry on). So embedding a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> in a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> gave you the best of both worlds, right?
              <em>(welll…)</em>
            </p>
            <figure id="attachment_17889" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17889">

                Wrap a <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> inside a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> and Netscape users will see the blink. Joy.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Better yet, you were safe in the knowledge that anybody using a browser that didn’t understand <em>either</em> of these tags could <em>still read your content</em>. Used properly, the
              web is about <em>progressive enhancement</em>. Implement for everybody, enhance for those who support the shiny features. JavaScript and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> can be applied with the same rules, and doing so pays dividends in maintainability and accessibility (though, sadly, that doesn’t stop people writing
              sites that needlessly <em>require</em> these technologies).
            </p>

                Personally, I was a (paying! – back when people used to pay for web browsers!) Opera user so I mostly saw neither <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> nor <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> elements.
                I don’t feel like I missed out.

              I remember, though, the first time I tried Netscape 7, in 2002. Netscape 7 and its close descendent are, as far as I can tell, the only web browsers to support <em>both</em>
              <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code>. Even then, it was picky about the order in which they were presented and the elements wrapped-within them. But support was
              good enough that some people’s personal web pages suddenly began to exhibit the most ugly effect imaginable: the combination of both scrolling and flashing text.
            </p>

              <figcaption id="caption-attachment-17892">
                If Netscape 7’s <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> didn’t already make your eyes bleed (I’ve toned it down here by installing the “classic skin”), its simultaneous
                rendering of <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> would.

              The <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag is very-definitely <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=blink">dead</a> (<a href="http://tstbtbt.com/">hurrah!</a>), but you can <a href="https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-blinking-effect-with-css3-animations.html">bring it back with pure&nbsp;</a><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets"><a href="https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-blinking-effect-with-css3-animations.html">CSS</a></abbr> if you must.

However, if you’re in any doubt as to whether or not
              you should use it: you shouldn’t. If you’re looking for digital nostalgia, <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/8442/internet-nostalgia-2010s-geocities-tumblr-vaporwave">there’s a whole

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-3222385872113044921" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>Just as I was <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2025/02/research-then-and-now.html">complaining</a> that we haven't seen many surprising breakthroughs in complexity recently, we get an earthquake of a result to start the year, showing that all algorithms can be simulated using considerable less memory than the time of the original algorithm. You can reuse space (memory) but you can't reuse time, and this new result from Ryan Williams in an upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2025/017/">STOC paper</a>&nbsp;provides the first stark difference.</p><p>DTIME(\(t(n)\)) \(\subseteq\) DSPACE(\(\sqrt{t(n)\log t(n)}\))</p><p>This is a vast improvement on the previous best known simulation, the classic 1977 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/322003.322015">Hopcroft-Paul-Valiant paper</a>&nbsp;showing</p><p>DTIME(\(t(n)\)) \(\subseteq\) DSPACE(\(t(n)/\log t(n)\))</p><p>only slightly lower than the trivial \(t(n)\) bound. Williams gets a huge near quadratic improvement that will go down as a true classic complexity theorem. Note that the space simulation does not maintain the time bound.</p><p>Williams' proof relies on a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3618260.3649664">space-efficient tree evaluation algorithm</a> by James Cook and Ian Mertz from last year's STOC conference. Cook and Mertz's algorithm builds on earlier work on catalytic computing, highlighted in a <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/catalytic-computing-taps-the-full-power-of-a-full-hard-drive-20250218/">recent Quanta article</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me give an highly overly simplified view of the combined proof.</p><p>A \(t(n)\) time Turing machine uses at most that much space on its tapes. Split the tapes into \(\sqrt{t(n)}\) segments of size \(\sqrt{t(n)}\). Using the fact that it takes \(\sqrt{t(n)}\)&nbsp;time to cross an entire segment, Williams with some clever tricks models acceptance of the Turing machines as a circuit of bounded degree and depth<b>&nbsp;</b>\(\sqrt{t(n)}\), where the wires carry the contents of the size \(\sqrt{t(n)}\) segments at various times in the computation.&nbsp;</p><p>Williams then applies the tree evaluation algorithm of Cook and Mertz. Cook and Mertz use finite fields to encode these segments as a combination of registers of size \(\log t(n)\) and show how to compute the value of each node of the tree using only \(\sqrt{t(n)}\) space for the local computation plus needing to only remember a constant number of registers while reusing the rest of the space when recursively computing the tree. It's pretty magical how they manage to make it all work.&nbsp;</p><p>It's worth going through the proof yourself. I recommend Sections 3.1 and Footnote 6 in Williams' paper (a slightly weaker space bound but much simpler) and Sections 2-4 of the Cook-Mertz paper. Oded Goldreich has an <a href="https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/VO/tree-eval.pdf">alternative exposition</a> of the Cook-Mertz algorithm and proof.</p><p>Williams' theorem works for multitape Turing machines and oblivious random-access machines, where the queries to the memory are fixed in advance. He shows how to use this result to compute the output a circuit of size \(s\) using nearly \(\sqrt{s}\) space. Fully general random access machines remains open, as does nondeterministic and other models of computation (random, quantum, etc).</p><p>In 1986 my advisor Mike Sipser gave the&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0000(88)90035-9">first hardness vs randomness result</a>, showing roughly that if there were problems that took time \(2^n\) but could not be solved in space \(2^{.99n}\) on multi-tape Turing machines then RP = P. Williams' theorem kills this assumption though we've developed <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2006/03/uniform-derandomization-assumptions.html">weaker assumptions</a> since.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving forward, can we push Williams' result to get a simulation in space \(n^\epsilon\) for \(\epsilon&lt;1/2\). A simulation for all \(\epsilon&gt;0\) would separate P from PSPACE. Even a slight improvement would have applications for alternating time. Maybe try to use the Cook-Mertz techniques directly in the Turing machine simulation instead of going through computation trees.</p><p>Read sections 4 and 5 of Williams' paper for some further consequences and challenges for further improvements.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>40 years ago today, I joined Apple Computer on April 27, 1978. It was a big turning point in my life and I am glad I said "Yes".</p><p>

I was working on my PhD in neuroscience with Doug Bowden at the University of Washington Regional Primate Research Center. Jef Raskin, a professor and friend from my undergraduate days at UC San Diego, called and urged me to join him at an exciting new startup called Apple Computer. </p><p>

I told him I had to finish my PhD, a required credential for researching brains and consciousness. But Jef would not take "No" for an answer, and sent me roundtrip airplane tickets with a note: "Just visit for a weekend, no strings attached." My dad lived in nearby Los Gatos so I decided to visit.</p><p>

I don't know what Jef told Steve Jobs about me, but Steve spent the entire day recruiting me. He introduced me to all 30 employees at Apple Computer. They seemed intelligent and passionate, and looked like they were having fun, but that was not enough to lure me away from my graduate studies.</p><p>

Toward the end of the day, Steve took me aside and told me that any hot new technology I read about was actually two years old. "There is a lag time between when someting is invented, and when it is available to the public. If you want to make a difference in the world, you have to be ahead of that lag time. Come to Apple where you can invent the future and change millions of people's lives." </p><p>

Then he gave me a visual: "Think how fun it is to surf on the front edge of a wave, and how not-fun to dog paddle on the tail edge of the same wave." That image persuaded me, and within two weeks I had quit my graduate program, moved to Silicon Valley, and was working at Apple Computer. I never finished my neuroscience degree, and my dad was mad at me for wasting ten years of college education that he helped to pay for. I was pretty nervous, but knew I had made the right choice.</p><p>

Steve Jobs and I became close friends. We went for long walks at Castle Rock State Park, shared meals and wide-ranging conversations about life and design. We bounced ideas off each other. Sometimes he would start a conversation with "Here's a crazy idea...", and the idea would go back and forth and evolve into a serious discussion, or occasionally a workable design. Steve listened to me and challenged me. His support at Apple allowed me to made a difference in the world. </p><p>

I wanted to port the UCSD Pascal system to the Apple II. We needed to build software in a cumulative fashion with libraries of reusable modules, and Apple BASIC didn't even have local variables. My manager said "No", but I went over his head to Steve. Steve thought Apple users were fine with BASIC and 6502 assembly language, but since I argued so passionately, he would give me two weeks to prove him wrong. Within hours I boarded a plane to San Diego, worked like crazy for two weeks, and returned with a working UCSD Pascal System that Apple ended up using to bootstrap the Lisa development.</p><p>

After the UCSD Pascal system shipped, Steve asked me to work on on Apple's new Lisa project. The Apple II had optional game paddle knobs, but software writers could not count on them because not every user had them. I convinced project manager Tom Whitney that the Lisa computer needed to include a mouse in the box so we could write software that counted on a pointing device. Otherwise a graphics editor would have to be designed to be usable with only cursor keys.</p><p>

The Apple II displayed white text on a black background. I argued that to do graphics properly we had to switch to a white background like paper. It works fine to invert text when printing, but it would not work for a photo to be printed in negative. The Lisa hardware team complained the screen would flicker too much, and they would need faster refresh with more expensive RAM to prevent smearing when scrolling. Steve listened to all the pros and cons then sided with a white background for the sake of graphics.</p><p>

The Lisa and Macintosh were designed with full bitmap displays. This gave tremendous flexibility in what you could draw, but at a big cost. There were a lot of pixels to set and clear anytime you wanted to draw a character, line, image, or area. I wrote the optimized assembly language QuickDraw graphics primitives that all Lisa and Macintosh applications called to write the pixels. QuickDraw performance made the bitmap display and graphical user interface practical <span>(see <a href="https://www.folklore.org/I_Still_Remember_Regions.html"><span>I Still Remember Regions</span></a>)</span>.</p><p>

To handle overlapping windows and graphics clipping, I wrote the original Lisa Window Manager. I also wrote the Lisa Event Manager and Menu Manager, and invented the pull-down menu. Andy Hertzfeld adapted these for use on the Mac, and with these and QuickDraw, my code accounted for almost two thirds of the original Macintosh ROM. </p><p>

I had fun writing the MacPaint bitmap painting program that shipped with every Mac <span>(see <a href="https://www.folklore.org/MacPaint_Evolution.html"><span>MacPaint Evolution</span></a>)</span>. I learned a lot from watching Susan Kare using my early versions. MacPaint showed people how fun and creative a computer with a graphics display and a mouse could be.</p><p>

<a href="https://www.folklore.org/images/Macintosh/Steve_and_Bill.jpg"><img src="https://www.folklore.org/images/Macintosh/Steve_and_Bill_t.jpg"></a>The portrait of Steve and me was made by Norman Seeff at Steve's home in December 1983, just before the Mac was introduced. Steve's expression looks like he is calculating how to harness this kid's energy. Some say Steve used me, but I say he harnessed and motivated me, and drew out my best creative energy. It was exciting working at Apple, knowing that whatever we invented would be used by millions of people.</p><p>

<a href="https://www.folklore.org/images/Macintosh/revolution.jpg"><img src="https://www.folklore.org/images/Macintosh/revolution_t.jpg"></a>The image showing the Mac team is from the cover of Andy Hertzfeld's great little book, "Revolution in the Valley, The Insanely Great Story of How the Mac Was Made." You can also read these stories at Andy's website www.folklore.org.  </p><p>

Inspired by a mind-expanding LSD journey in 1985, I designed the HyperCard authoring system that enabled non-programmers to make their own interactive media. HyperCard used a metaphor of stacks of cards containing graphics, text, buttons, and links that could take you to another card. The HyperTalk scripting language implemented by Dan Winkler was a gentle introduction to event-based programming. Steve Jobs wanted me to leave Apple and join him at Next, but I chose to stay with Apple to finish HyperCard. Apple published HyperCard in 1987, six years before Mosaic, the first web browser. </p><p>

I worked at Apple for 12 years, making tools to empower creative people, and helping Apple grow from 30 employees to 15,000. In 1990, with John Sculley's blessing, I left Apple with Marc Porat and Andy Hertzfeld to co-found General Magic and help to invent the personal communicator.</p><p>

The road I took 40 years ago has made all the difference. I still follow research in consciousness, but I am more than satisfied with the contributions I was able to make with my years at Apple. I am grateful to Jef Raskin and Steve Jobs for believing in me and giving me the opportunity to change the world for the better.

<p>I’ve been adding more integration tests for <a href="https://github.com/cmu-pasta/fray">Fray</a> recently.

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="bug-behavior">Bug Behavior</h2>
<p>The <code>ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</code> schedules tasks by adding them to a work queue and executing them in worker threads. Depending on the executor’s state, users would expect the following behavior:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>State</th>
          <th><code>ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.schedule</code></th>
          <th><code>FutureTask.get</code></th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>RUNNING</td>
          <td>returns task</td>
          <td>blocks until task completes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>SHUTDOWN</td>
          <td>throws <code>RejectedExecutionException</code></td>
          <td>throws <code>CancellationException</code></td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>However, Fray revealed that when the <code>ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</code> is in the <code>SHUTDOWN</code> state, the <code>FutureTask.get</code> method may block indefinitely waiting for the task to complete.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-bug-occurs">How the Bug Occurs</h2>
<p>The bug manifests when Fray interleaves the <code>schedule</code> method and the <code>shutdown</code> method. At line 9 of <code>ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.schedule</code>, the executor tries to add a new worker to execute tasks. It first checks whether the executor is in a state that allows the task to run. If the executor is in the <code>SHUTDOWN</code> state, the <code>schedule</code> method assumes that the shutdown process will terminate the task, so it simply returns (Line 14) without creating a new worker thread. However, this assumption breaks when the shutdown method transitions to the <code>SHUTDOWN</code> state but will not terminate the task, leaving it in a limbo state.</p>
<p>The following stack traces illustrate the problematic interleaving. The main thread (test worker) is going to create a new worker for the task, while the shutdown thread (Thread-3) is executing <code>tryTerminate</code> and setting the state to <code>TIDYING</code>.</p>
<img src="https://aoli.al/images/jdk-bug/stack_1.png">
<p>Next, Fray yields to the main thread, which performs the condition check at line 10 of <code>ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.schedule</code>. The executor is now in the <code>TIDYING</code> state, making both <code>runStateAtLeast(c, SHUTDOWN)</code> and <code>runStateAtLeast(c, STOP)</code> return true. The <code>schedule</code> method then returns the task without adding to a worker.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the shutdown thread, execution reaches <code>ctl.compareAndSet(c, ctlOf(TERMINATED, 0))</code> at line 16 of <code>ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.shutdown</code>. The <code>ctl</code> is set to <code>TERMINATED</code>, and the shutdown thread completes. At this point, no thread will execute or interrupt the task, leaving it blocked forever.</p>
<img src="https://aoli.al/images/jdk-bug/stack_2.png">
<h2 id="more-details">More Details</h2>
<p>While the bug is conceptually simple, reaching this state is not straightforward because <code>ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</code> and <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code> are designed to prevent such situations. For example, in the <code>tryTerminate</code> method (Line 23-29), <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code> checks whether the work queue is empty and workers are interrupted before setting the state to <code>TIDYING</code>. However, Fray demonstrates that this check can be bypassed if execution of <code>super.getQueue().add(task)</code> in the main thread is paused until the shutdown thread reaches the <code>ctl.compareAndSet(c, ctlOf(TIDYING, 0))</code> statement—a classic race condition.</p>
<h2 id="debugging-with-fray">Debugging with Fray</h2>
<p>Imagine discovering this bug in your codebase. You observe a thread blocked on <code>FutureTask.get</code>, but you don’t understand why. You cannot reproduce the bug because when you rerun the test, the deadlock disappears. Adding logging makes it disappear. Using a debugger makes it disappear. This is the notorious “Heisenbug” phenomenon common in concurrent programming.</p>
<p>This time, with Fray, you get a deterministic replay file that allows you to replay the execution step by step. You can observe the exact thread interleaving that triggers the bug and visualize the thread scheduling to understand the root cause.</p>
<h3 id="try-it-yourself">Try it Yourself!</h3>
<p>To experience this yourself, clone the <a href="https://github.com/aoli-al/JDK-ThreadPool-Bug-Demo">JDK bug repository</a> and open it with IntelliJ IDEA.</p>
<p>Then download the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/26623-fray-debugger">Fray plugin</a>.</p>
<p>In IntelliJ IDEA, open the <code>ScheduledThreadPoolExecutorTest</code> class and navigate to the <code>testWithFray</code> method.
Click the Run icon (▶️) next to the <code>testWithFray</code> method, select the first <code>Run 'ScheduledThreadPoolExecutorTest.testWithFray()'</code> button, and then select <code>frayTest</code>. If Fray finds the bug, it will display messages in the Run tool window.</p>
<img src="https://aoli.al/images/jdk-bug/fray_run_output.png">
<p>Look for the output <code>2025-06-07 13:58:06 [INFO]: The recording is saved to PATH_TO_REPLAY_FILE</code> and note this path for replaying the bug.</p>
<h3 id="replay-and-understand-the-bug">Replay and Understand the Bug</h3>
<p>Copy the path to the replay file, navigate to the <code>replayWithFray</code> method, and paste the path into the <code>replay</code> field in the <code>@ConcurrencyTest</code> annotation. Click the Run icon (<i></i>) next to the <code>replayWithFray</code> method, select <code>Replay (Fray) 'ScheduledThreadPoolExecutorTest.replayWithFray()'</code>, and then select <code>frayTest</code>.</p>
<img src="https://aoli.al/images/jdk-bug/fray_replay.png">
<p>Fray will replay the bug and pause at each context switch point (e.g., when the main thread is paused and yields to the shutdown thread). You can click the “Next step” button to step through the replay and observe how the bug unfolds. The Fray debugger also visualizes the thread timeline and highlights the currently executing lines in the editor.</p>
<p>Note that Fray is designed for application concurrency testing, so it hides highlights in JDK methods by default—you may only see highlights in the test code itself. However, since this capability proves valuable for testing the JDK, we plan to add a feature to show highlights in JDK methods in future releases.</p>
<h3 id="reporting-the-bug">Reporting the Bug</h3>
<p>When submitting this bug report, I created a <a href="https://github.com/aoli-al/jdk/commit/625420ba82d2b0ebac24d9954e09062e3fbc0378">patch</a> for the JDK that adds sleep statements to trigger the bug. However, the JDK team didn’t include this patch in the public bug report. Instead, the final report only described how to reproduce the bug using Fray.</p>
<p>Happy debugging.</p>

      <p dir="auto">Some features like append-only repositories rely on a server-side component that enforces them (because that shall only be controllable server-side, not client-side).</p>
<p dir="auto">So, that can only work, if such a server-side component exists, which is the case for borg 1.x ssh: repositories (but not for borg 1.x non-ssh: repositories).</p>
<p dir="auto">For borg2, we currently have:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>fs repos</li>
<li>sftp: repos</li>
<li>rclone: repos (enabling many different cloud providers)</li>
<li>s3/b3: repos</li>
<li>ssh: repos using client/server rpc code similar as in borg 1.x</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">So, only for the last method we have a borg server-side process that could enforce some features, but not for any of the other repo types.</p>
<p dir="auto">For append-only the current idea is that this should not be done within borg, but solved by a missing repo object delete permission enforced by the storage.</p>
<p dir="auto">borg create could then use credentials that miss permission to delete, while borg compact would use credentials that include permission to delete.</p>

<p>Think of this post as your field guide to a new way of building software. By the time you finish reading, you’ll understand not just the how but the why behind AI-assisted development that actually works.</p>
<h3 id="heres-what-youre-going-to-learn">Here’s What You’re Going to Learn</h3>
<p>First, we’ll explore how to genuinely achieve that mythical 10x productivity boost—not through magic, but through deliberate practices that amplify AI’s strengths while compensating for its weaknesses. You’ll discover why some developers ship features in hours while others fight their AI tools for days.</p>
<p>Next, I’ll walk you through the exact infrastructure we use at Julep to ship production code daily with Claude’s help. This isn’t theoretical—it’s battle-tested on a codebase serving real users with real money on the line. You’ll see our <code>CLAUDE.md</code> templates, our commit strategies, and the guardrails that keep us from shipping disasters.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you’ll understand why writing your own tests remains absolutely sacred, even (especially) in the age of AI. This single principle will save you from the midnight debugging sessions that plague developers who hand over too much control to their AI assistants.</p>
<p>We’ll explore the three distinct modes of AI-assisted development, each with its own rhythms and rules. Like a musician learning when to play forte versus pianissimo, you’ll develop an intuition for when to let AI lead versus when to take firm control.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>But here’s the real insight:</strong> Good development practices aren’t just nice-to-haves anymore—they’re the difference between AI that amplifies your capabilities and AI that amplifies your chaos. The research bears this out dramatically. <a href="#footnote-18WB" id="ref-18WB" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>Teams using rigorous practices deploy 46 times more frequently and are 440 times faster from commit to deployment. When you add AI to disciplined practices, these numbers don’t just add—they multiply.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-post-exists-from-meme-to-method">Why This Post Exists: From Meme to Method</h2>
<p>Let me take you back to when this all started. <a href="#footnote-28WB" id="ref-28WB" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a><em>Andrej Karpathy</em> <a href="#footnote-38WB" id="ref-38WB" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>tweeted about “vibe-coding”—this idea of letting AI write your code while you just vibe. The developer community had a good laugh. It sounded like the ultimate developer fantasy: kick back, sip coffee, let the machines do the work.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_b4f0291594b44dc8a105111fe0e6e166/_image_cache/e482b99a-9e1e-4f5b-b968-0bf6255566d2.png" alt="The birth of “vibe coding”" width="716" height="553" data-action="zoom"><span>The birth of “vibe coding”</span></p>
<p>Then <em>Anthropic</em> <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet">released Sonnet 3.7 and Claude Code</a>, and something unexpected happened. The joke stopped being funny because it started being… possible? Of course, our trusty friend <a href="https://www.cursor.com/">Cursor</a> had been around awhile but this new interface finally felt like <em>true vibe coding</em>.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://git.new/julep">Julep</a>, we build AI workflow orchestration. Our backend has years of accumulated decisions, patterns, and occasional technical debt. We have taken the utmost care to keep code quality high, and ample documentation for ourselves. However, the sheer size, and historical context of <em>why</em> different parts of the code are organized the way they are takes weeks for a good engineer to grok. Without proper guardrails when using Claude, you’re basically playing whack-a-mole with an overeager intern.</p>

<p><a href="#footnote-48WB" id="ref-48WB" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a><em>Steve Yegge</em> brilliantly coined the term <em>CHOP</em>—Chat-Oriented Programming in a slightly-dramatic-titled post <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/blog/the-death-of-the-junior-developer">“The death of the junior developer”</a>. It’s a perfect description of the surface mechanics: you chat with an AI until code materializes.</p>
<p>Think of traditional coding like sculpting marble. You start with a blank block and carefully chisel away, line by line, function by function. Every stroke is deliberate, every decision yours. It’s satisfying but slow.</p>
<p>Vibe-coding is more like conducting an orchestra. You’re not playing every instrument—you’re directing, shaping, guiding. The AI provides the raw musical talent, but without your vision, it’s just noise. With your direction, it becomes a symphony.</p>
<p>There are three distinct postures you can take when vibe-coding, each suited to different moments in the development cycle:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>AI as First-Drafter</strong>: Here, AI generates initial implementations while you focus on architecture and design. It’s like having a junior developer who can type at the speed of thought but needs constant guidance. Perfect for boilerplate, CRUD operations, and standard patterns.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AI as Pair-Programmer</strong>: This is the sweet spot for most development. You’re actively collaborating, bouncing ideas back and forth. The AI suggests approaches, you refine them. You sketch the outline, AI fills in details. It’s like pair programming with someone who has read every programming book ever written but has never actually shipped code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AI as Validator</strong>: Sometimes you write code and want a sanity check. AI reviews for bugs, suggests improvements, spots patterns you might have missed. Think of it as an incredibly well-read code reviewer who never gets tired or cranky.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The crucial insight is this: you shift from being a writer to being an editor. Instead of crafting every line, you’re reviewing, refining, directing. But—and this cannot be overstated—you remain the architect. Claude is your intern with encyclopedic knowledge but zero context about your specific system, your users, your business logic.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-three-modes-of-vibe-coding-a-practical-framework">The Three Modes of Vibe-Coding: A Practical Framework</h2>
<p>After months of experimentation and more than a few production incidents, I’ve settled on three distinct modes of operation. Each has its own rhythm, its own guardrails, and its own optimal use cases.</p>
<h3 id="mode-1-the-playground">Mode 1: <em>The Playground</em></h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_b4f0291594b44dc8a105111fe0e6e166/_image_cache/ede9227b-cd8d-4505-ba93-21c9c7fcb31a.png" alt="Lighter Fluid" width="658" height="268" data-action="zoom"><span>Lighter Fluid</span></p>
<p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Weekend hacks, personal scripts, proof-of-concepts, and those “I wonder if…” moments that make programming fun.</p>
<p>In <em>Playground Mode</em>, you embrace the chaos. There’s zero ceremony, no extensive documentation, no careful guardrails. Claude writes 80-90% of the code while you provide just enough steering to keep things on track. It’s liberating and slightly terrifying.</p>
<p>Here’s what Playground Mode looks like in practice: You have an idea for a script to analyze your Spotify listening history. You open Claude, describe what you want in plain English, and watch as it generates a complete solution. No <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file, no careful prompting—just raw, unfiltered AI assistance.</p>
<p>The beauty of Playground Mode is its speed. You can go from idea to working prototype in minutes. The danger is that this cowboy coding style is absolutely inappropriate for anything that matters. Use it for experiments, never for production. Trust me, while the amazing folks preaching otherwise, good engineering principles still matter, <a href="https://www.ikangai.com/vibe-coding-in-software-engineering/">now more than ever</a>.</p>

<p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Projects under <em>~5,000 lines of code</em>, side projects with real users, demos (you don’t want to break), or well-scoped small services in larger systems.</p>
<p>This is where vibe-coding starts to shine for real work. You need structure, but not so much that it slows you down. The key innovation here is the <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file—custom documentation that Claude automatically reads when invoked. From Anthropic’s <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices">Best practices for Claude Code</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CLAUDE.md is a special file that Claude automatically pulls into context when starting a conversation. This makes it an ideal place for documenting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common bash commands<br>
</li>
<li>Core files and utility functions<br>
</li>
<li>Code style guidelines<br>
</li>
<li>Testing instructions<br>
</li>
<li>Repository etiquette (e.g., branch naming, merge vs.&nbsp;rebase, etc.)<br>
</li>
<li>Developer environment setup (e.g., pyenv use, which compilers work)<br>
</li>
<li>Any unexpected behaviors or warnings particular to the project<br>
</li>
<li>Other information you want Claude to remember</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of repeatedly explaining your project’s conventions, you document them once. Here’s a real example from a recent side project:</p>
<pre><code><span>## Project: Analytics Dashboard  </span>

This is a Next.js dashboard for visualizing user analytics. We follow  
these conventions to maintain consistency:  

<span>### Architecture Decisions  </span>
<span>-</span> Server Components by default, Client Components only when necessary  
<span>-</span> tRPC for type-safe API calls  
<span>-</span> Prisma for database access with explicit select statements  
<span>-</span> Tailwind for styling (no custom CSS files)  

<span>### Code Style  </span>
<span>-</span> Formatting: Prettier with 100-char lines  
<span>-</span> Imports: sorted with simple-import-sort  
<span>-</span> Components: Pascal case, co-located with their tests  
<span>-</span> Hooks: always prefix with 'use'  

<span>### Patterns to Follow  </span>
<span>-</span> Data fetching happens in Server Components  
<span>-</span> Client Components receive data as props  
<span>-</span> Use Zod schemas for all external data  
<span>-</span> Error boundaries around every data display component  

<span>### What NOT to Do  </span>
<span>-</span> Don't use useEffect for data fetching  
<span>-</span> Don't create global state without explicit approval  
<span>-</span> Don't bypass TypeScript with 'any' types  </code></pre>
<p>With this context, Claude becomes remarkably effective. It’s like the difference between explaining your project to a new hire every single day versus having them read the onboarding docs once.</p>
<p>But <em>Pair Programming Mode</em> requires more than just documentation. You need to actively guide the AI with what I call “anchor comments”—breadcrumbs that prevent Claude from wandering into the wilderness:</p>
<pre><code><span>// AIDEV-<span>NOTE:</span> This component uses virtual scrolling for performance  </span>
<span>// See: https://tanstack.com/virtual/latest  </span>
<span>// Don't convert to regular mapping—we handle 10k+ items  </span>

<span>export</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>DataTable</span>(<span>{ items }: DataTableProps</span>) </span>{  
  <span>// Claude, when you edit this, maintain the virtual scrolling  </span>
  ...  
}  </code></pre>
<p>These comments serve a dual purpose: they guide the AI and document your code for humans. It’s documentation that pays dividends in both directions. The <strong>key distinction</strong> between such “anchor comments” and regular comments: these are <em>written</em>, <em>maintained</em>, and <em>meant to be used</em> by Claude itself. Here’s an <em>actual snippet</em> from our <a href="https://github.com/julep-ai/julep/blob/dev/AGENTS.md">project’s CLAUDE.md</a>:</p>
<pre><code><span>## Anchor comments  </span>

Add specially formatted comments throughout the codebase, where appropriate, for yourself as inline knowledge that can be easily <span>`grep`</span>ped for.  

<span>### Guidelines:  </span>

<span>-</span> Use <span>`AIDEV-NOTE:`</span>, <span>`AIDEV-TODO:`</span>, or <span>`AIDEV-QUESTION:`</span> (all-caps prefix) for comments aimed at AI and developers.  
<span>-</span> Keep them concise (≤ 120 chars).  
<span>-</span> <span>**Important:**</span> Before scanning files, always first try to <span>**locate existing anchors**</span> <span>`AIDEV-*`</span> in relevant subdirectories.  
<span>-</span> <span>**Update relevant anchors**</span> when modifying associated code.  
<span>-</span> <span>**Do not remove `AIDEV-NOTE`s**</span> without explicit human instruction.  

Example:  
<span># AIDEV-NOTE: perf-hot-path; avoid extra allocations (see ADR-24)  </span>
async def render<span>_feed(...):  
    ...  </span></code></pre>
<h3 id="mode-3-productionmonorepo-scale">Mode 3: <em>Production/Monorepo Scale</em></h3>

<p><strong>When to use it</strong>: Large codebases, systems with real users, anything where bugs cost money or reputation.</p>
<p>Claude can generate tremendous amounts of code, but integrating it into a complex system requires careful orchestration.</p>
<p>Let me start with a big caveat: <strong>vibe coding at this scale does NOT scale very well,</strong> yet. I definitely do see these systems getting significantly better at handling larger codebases <em>but</em>, for them to be effective, significant effort is needed to help them navigate, understand, and <em>safely</em> hack on them without getting lost in a maze. Generally speaking, it’s better to section them into individual services, and <a href="#footnote-58WB" id="ref-58WB" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>sub modules when possible.</p>
<p>As a universal principle, good engineering practices apply to large-scale projects, vibe coded or not. For example, at production scale, boundaries become critical. Every integration point needs explicit documentation:</p>
<pre><code><span># AIDEV-<span>NOTE:</span> API Contract Boundary - v2.3.1  </span>
<span># ANY changes require version bump and migration plan  </span>
<span># See: docs/api-versioning.md  </span>

<span>@router.get(<span><span>"/users/{user_id}/feed"</span></span>)  </span>
<span>async</span> <span><span>def</span> <span>get_user_feed</span>(<span>user_id: UUID</span>) -&gt; FeedResponse:</span>  
    <span># Claude: the response shape here is sacred  </span>
    <span># Changes break real apps in production  </span>
    ...  </code></pre>
<p>Without these boundaries, Claude will happily “improve” your API and break every client in production. Bottom line: larger projects should <em>definitely</em> start adopting vibe coding in parts, and adopt methodologies that enhance that experience but, don’t expect to land large features reliably just yet. (as of <em>June 7, 2025 / AI epoch</em>)</p>
<h2 id="infrastructure-the-foundation-of-sustainable-ai-development">Infrastructure: The Foundation of Sustainable AI Development</h2>
<h3 id="claude.md-your-single-source-of-truth"><code>CLAUDE.md</code>: Your Single Source of Truth</h3>
<p>Let me be absolutely clear about this: <code>CLAUDE.md</code> is not optional documentation. Every minute you spend updating it saves an hour of cleanup later.</p>
<p>Think of <code>CLAUDE.md</code> as a constitution for your codebase. It establishes the fundamental laws that govern how code should be written, how systems interact, and what patterns to follow or avoid. Organizations that invest in developing the skills and capabilities of their teams get better outcomes—and your <code>CLAUDE.md</code> is that investment crystallized into documentation.</p>
<p>Here’s an abridged version of <a href="https://github.com/julep-ai/julep/blob/dev/AGENTS.md">our production <code>CLAUDE.md</code></a> structure, refined over thousands of AI-assisted commits:</p>
<pre><code><span># CLAUDE.md - Julep Backend Service  </span>

<span>## The Golden Rule  </span>
When unsure about implementation details, ALWAYS ask the developer.  

<span>## Project Context  </span>
Julep enables developers to build stateful AI agents using declarative  
workflows.  

<span>## Critical Architecture Decisions  </span>

<span>### Why Temporal?  </span>
We use Temporal for workflow orchestration because:  
<span>1.</span> Workflows can run for days/weeks with perfect reliability  
<span>2.</span> Automatic recovery from any failure point  

<span>### Why PostgreSQL + pgvector?  </span>
<span>1.</span> ACID compliance for workflow state (can't lose user data)  
<span>2.</span> Vector similarity search for agent memory  

<span>### Why TypeSpec?  </span>
Single source of truth for API definitions:  
<span>-</span> OpenAPI specs  
<span>-</span> TypeScript/Python clients  
<span>-</span> Validation schemas  

<span>## Code Style and Patterns  </span>

<span>### Anchor comments  </span>

Add specially formatted comments throughout the codebase, where appropriate, for yourself as inline knowledge that can be easily <span>`grep`</span>ped for.  

<span>### Guidelines:  </span>

<span>-</span> Use <span>`AIDEV-NOTE:`</span>, <span>`AIDEV-TODO:`</span>, or <span>`AIDEV-QUESTION:`</span> (all-caps prefix) for comments aimed at AI and developers.  
<span>-</span> <span>**Important:**</span> Before scanning files, always first try to <span>**grep for existing anchors**</span> <span>`AIDEV-*`</span> in relevant subdirectories.  
<span>-</span> <span>**Update relevant anchors**</span> when modifying associated code.  
<span>-</span> <span>**Do not remove `AIDEV-NOTE`s**</span> without explicit human instruction.  
<span>-</span> Make sure to add relevant anchor comments, whenever a file or piece of code is:  
<span>  *</span> too complex, or  
<span>  *</span> very important, or  
<span>  *</span> confusing, or  
<span>  *</span> could have a bug  

<span>## Domain Glossary (Claude, learn these!)  </span>

<span>-</span> <span>**Agent**</span>: AI entity with memory, tools, and defined behavior  
<span>-</span> <span>**Task**</span>: Workflow definition composed of steps (NOT a Celery task)  
<span>-</span> <span>**Execution**</span>: Running instance of a task  
<span>-</span> <span>**Tool**</span>: Function an agent can call (browser, API, etc.)  
<span>-</span> <span>**Session**</span>: Conversation context with memory  
<span>-</span> <span>**Entry**</span>: Single interaction within a session  

<span>## What AI Must NEVER Do  </span>

<span>1.</span> <span>**Never modify test files**</span> - Tests encode human intent  
<span>2.</span> <span>**Never change API contracts**</span> - Breaks real applications  
<span>3.</span> <span>**Never alter migration files**</span> - Data loss risk  
<span>4.</span> <span>**Never commit secrets**</span> - Use environment variables  
<span>5.</span> <span>**Never assume business logic**</span> - Always ask  
<span>6.</span> <span>**Never remove AIDEV- comments**</span> - They're there for a reason  

Remember: We optimize for maintainability over cleverness.  
When in doubt, choose the boring solution.  </code></pre>
<p>This document becomes the shared context between you and Claude. It’s like having a senior developer whispering guidance in Claude’s ear throughout the coding session.</p>

<p>As your codebase grows, CLAUDE.md alone isn’t enough. You need inline guidance—what I call anchor comments. These serve as local context that prevents AI from making locally bad decisions.</p>
<p>Think of your codebase as a city and anchor comments as street signs. Without them, even smart visitors get lost. Here’s how we use them effectively:</p>
<pre><code><span># AIDEV-<span>NOTE:</span> Critical performance path - this serves 100k req/sec  </span>
<span># DO NOT add database queries here  </span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_user_feed</span>(<span>user_id: UUID, cached_data: FeedCache</span>) -&gt; List[FeedItem]:</span>  
    <span># We need to avoid mutating the cached data  </span>
    items = cached_data.items[:]  

    <span># AIDEV-<span>TODO:</span> Implement pagination (ticket: FEED-123)  </span>
    <span># Need cursor-based pagination for infinite scroll  </span>

    <span># AIDEV-QUESTION: Why do we filter private items here instead of in cache?  </span>
    <span># AIDEV-ANSWER: Historical context: Privacy rules can change between cache updates  </span>
    filtered = [item <span>for</span> item <span>in</span> items <span>if</span> user_has_access(user_id, item)]  

    <span>return</span> filtered  </code></pre>
<p>These comments create a narrative that helps both AI and humans understand not just what the code does, but why it does it that way.</p>
<h3 id="git-workflows-for-ai-development">Git Workflows for AI Development</h3>
<p>One of the most underappreciated aspects of AI-assisted development is how it changes your git workflow. You’re now generating code at a pace that can quickly pollute your git history if you’re not careful.</p>
<p>It really only applies to very large codebases because it is <em>not</em> a very straightforward tool, but I recommend using <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices#c-use-git-worktrees">git worktrees</a> to create isolated environments for AI experiments:</p>
<pre><code><span># Create an AI playground without polluting main  </span>
git worktree add ../ai-experiments/cool-feature -b ai/cool-feature  

<span># Let Claude go wild in the isolated worktree  </span>
<span>cd</span> ../ai-experiments/cool-feature  
<span># ... lots of experimental commits ...  </span>

<span># Cherry-pick the good stuff back to main  </span>
<span>cd</span> ../main-repo  
git cherry-pick abc123  <span># Just the commits that worked  </span>

<span># Clean up when done  </span>
git worktree remove ../ai-experiments/cool-feature  </code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: Read about <a href="https://dev.to/yankee/practical-guide-to-git-worktree-58o0">how to use worktrees</a>, and check out the nifty <a href="https://github.com/taecontrol/wt"><code>wt</code></a> tool.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This approach gives you the best of both worlds: Claude can experiment freely while your main branch history stays clean and meaningful.</p>
<p>For commit messages, we’ve standardized on tagging AI-assisted commits:</p>
<pre><code>feat: implement user feed caching [AI]  

- Add Redis-based cache for user feeds  
- Implement cache warming on user login  
- Add metrics for cache hit rate  

AI-assisted: core logic generated, tests human-written  </code></pre>
<p>This transparency helps during code review—reviewers know to pay extra attention to AI-generated code.</p>
<h2 id="the-sacred-rule-humans-write-tests">The Sacred Rule: Humans Write Tests</h2>
<p>Now we come to the most important principle in AI-assisted development. It’s so important that I’m going to repeat it in multiple ways until it’s burned into your memory:</p>
<p><strong>Never. Let. AI. Write. Your. Tests.</strong></p>
<p>Tests are not just code that verifies other code works. Tests are executable specifications. They encode your actual intentions, your edge cases, your understanding of the problem domain. High performers excel at both speed and stability—there’s no trade-off. Tests are how you achieve both.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_b4f0291594b44dc8a105111fe0e6e166/_image_cache/5dd77e55-5b53-412a-a169-e61d88eff60a.png" alt="Beware…" width="625" height="625" data-action="zoom"><span>Beware…</span></p>
<p>Let me illustrate why this matters with an example. Let’s say we asked Claude to implement a rate limiter:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>RateLimiter</span>:</span>  
    <span><span>def</span> <span>__init__</span>(<span>self, max_requests: <span>int</span>, window_seconds: <span>int</span></span>):</span>  
        self.max_requests = max_requests  
        self.window_seconds = window_seconds  
        self.requests = defaultdict(<span>list</span>)  

    <span><span>def</span> <span>is_allowed</span>(<span>self, user_id: <span>str</span></span>) -&gt; bool:</span>  
        now = time.time()  
        user_requests = self.requests[user_id]  

        <span># Clean old requests  </span>
        self.requests[user_id] = [  
            req_time <span>for</span> req_time <span>in</span> user_requests  
            <span>if</span> now - req_time &lt; self.window_seconds  
        ]  

        <span>if</span> <span>len</span>(self.requests[user_id]) &lt; self.max_requests:  
            self.requests[user_id].append(now)  
            <span>return</span> <span>True</span>  
        <span>return</span> <span>False</span>  </code></pre>
<p>Looks reasonable, right? Claude even helpfully generated tests:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>test_rate_limiter</span>():</span>  
    limiter = RateLimiter(max_requests=<span>3</span>, window_seconds=<span>60</span>)  

    <span>assert</span> limiter.is_allowed(<span>"user1"</span>) == <span>True</span>  
    <span>assert</span> limiter.is_allowed(<span>"user1"</span>) == <span>True</span>  
    <span>assert</span> limiter.is_allowed(<span>"user1"</span>) == <span>True</span>  
    <span>assert</span> limiter.is_allowed(<span>"user1"</span>) == <span>False</span>  <span># Limit reached  </span></code></pre>
<p>But here’s what Claude’s tests missed—what only a human who understands the business requirements would test: Claude’s implementation has a memory leak. Users who hit the API once and never return leave their data in memory forever. The AI-generated tests check the happy path but miss this critical production concern.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_b4f0291594b44dc8a105111fe0e6e166/_image_cache/a4c32be3-f91c-44e3-aebd-c65f50fbd379.png" alt="Vibe coding at its best" width="400" height="144" data-action="zoom"><span>Vibe coding at its best</span></p>
<p>This is why humans write tests. We understand the context, the production environment, the edge cases that matter. At Julep, our rule is absolute:</p>
<pre><code><span>## Testing Discipline  </span>

| What | AI CAN Do | AI MUST NOT Do |  
|------|-----------|----------------|  
| Implementation | Generate business logic | Touch test files |  
| Test Planning | Suggest test scenarios | Write test code |  
| Debugging | Analyze test failures | Modify test expectations |  

If an AI tool touches a test file, the PR gets rejected. No exceptions.  </code></pre>
<p>Your tests are your specification. They’re your safety net. They’re the encoded wisdom of every bug you’ve fixed and every edge case you’ve discovered. Guard them zealously.</p>
<h2 id="scaling-without-drowning-token-economics-and-context-management">Scaling Without Drowning: Token Economics and Context Management</h2>
<p>One of the most counterintuitive lessons in AI-assisted development is that being stingy with context to save tokens actually costs you more. It’s like trying to save money on gas by only filling your tank halfway—you just end up making more trips to the gas station.</p>
<p>Token budgets matter. Provide focused prompts, reduce diff length, and avoid large-file bloat by summarizing intent in advance. But “focused” doesn’t mean “minimal”—it means “relevant and complete.”</p>
<p>Let me show you the false economy of starved prompts:</p>
<p><strong>Starved Prompt Attempt:</strong></p>
<pre><code>"Add caching to the user endpoint"  </code></pre>
<p><strong>Claude’s Response:</strong> Implements caching… but:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uses in-memory cache (won’t work with multiple servers)<br>
</li>
<li>No cache invalidation strategy<br>
</li>
<li>No metrics or monitoring<br>
</li>
<li>No consideration of cache stampede</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> 3 more rounds of fixes, <em>4x the tokens spent</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Context-Rich Prompt:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Add Redis caching to the GET /users/{id} endpoint.  

Context:  
- This endpoint serves 50k requests/minute  
- We run 12 API servers behind a load balancer  
- User data changes infrequently (few times per day)  
- We already have Redis at cache.redis.internal:6379  
- Use our standard cache key pattern: "user:v1:{id}"  
- Include cache hit/miss metrics (we use Prometheus)  
- Implement cache-aside pattern with 1 hour TTL  
- Handle cache stampede with probabilistic early expiration  

See our caching guide: docs/patterns/caching.md  </code></pre>
<p>The lesson? Front-load context to avoid iteration cycles. Think of tokens like investing in good tools—the upfront cost pays for itself many times over.</p>
<p>In fact, I recommend that all projects should routinely ask Claude to look through the codebase changes, and add context to <code>CLAUDE.md</code></p>
<h3 id="fresh-sessions-and-mental-models">Fresh Sessions and Mental Models</h3>
<p>Here’s another counterintuitive practice: use fresh Claude sessions for distinct tasks. It’s tempting to keep one long-running conversation, but this leads to context pollution.</p>
<p>Think of it like this: you wouldn’t use the same cutting board for vegetables after cutting raw chicken. Similarly, don’t use the same Claude session for database migrations after discussing frontend styling. The context bleeds through in subtle ways.</p>
<p>Our rule: One task, one session. When the task is done, start fresh. This keeps Claude’s “mental model” clean and focused.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-shipping-structured-errors-in-production">Case Study: Shipping Structured Errors in Production</h2>
<p>Let me walk you through a real refactoring we did at Julep that showcases production-scale vibe-coding. We needed to replace our ad-hoc error handling with a structured error hierarchy across 500+ endpoints.</p>
<p><strong>The Human Decisions (The Why):</strong></p>
<p>First, we had to decide on our error taxonomy. This is pure architectural work—Claude can’t make these decisions because they involve understanding our business, our users, and our operational needs:</p>
<pre><code># SPEC.md - Error Hierarchy Design (Human-Written)  

## Error Philosophy  
- Client errors (4xx) must include actionable feedback  
- System errors (5xx) must include trace IDs for debugging  
- All errors must be JSON-serializable  
- Error codes must be stable (clients depend on them)  

## Hierarchy  
BaseError  
├── ClientError (4xx)  
│   ├── ValidationError  
│   │   ├── SchemaValidationError - Request doesn't match schema  
│   │   ├── BusinessRuleError - Valid schema, invalid business logic  
│   │   └── RateLimitError - Too many requests  
│   └── AuthError  
│       ├── AuthenticationError - Who are you?  
│       └── AuthorizationError - You can't do that  
└── SystemError (5xx)  
    ├── DatabaseError - Connection, timeout, deadlock  
    ├── ExternalServiceError - APIs, webhooks failing  
    └── InfrastructureError - Disk full, OOM, etc.  

## Error Response Format  
{  
  "error": {  
    "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED",     // Stable code for clients  
    "message": "Email already exists", // Human-readable  
    "details": { ... },               // Structured data  
    "trace_id": "abc-123-def"         // For debugging  
  }  
}  </code></pre>
<p><strong>The AI Execution (The How):</strong></p>
<p>With the specification clear, we unleashed Claude on the mechanical refactoring:</p>
<pre><code><span>### Prompt to Claude:  </span>

Refactor our error handling to match SPEC.md.  

Current state:  
<span>-</span> raise ValueError("Invalid email")  
<span>-</span> return {"error": "Something went wrong"}, 500  

Target state:  
<span>-</span> Use error hierarchy from SPEC.md  
<span>-</span> Include proper error codes  
<span>-</span> Add trace<span>_id to all 5xx errors  

Start with the auth module. Show me the plan before implementing.  </span></code></pre>
<p>Claude’s plan was solid:</p>
<pre><code>1. Create error hierarchy in `common/errors.py`  
2. Create error response formatter  
3. Update each module systematically  
4. Add error handling middleware  </code></pre>
<p>Claude was able to handle the tedious work of finding and updating 500+ error sites, while we focused on reviewing:</p>
<pre><code><span># Before (Claude found these patterns):  </span>
<span>if</span> <span>not</span> user:  
    <span>raise</span> Exception(<span>"User not found"</span>)  

<span># After (Claude's refactoring):  </span>
<span>if</span> <span>not</span> user:  
    <span>raise</span> AuthenticationError(  
        message=<span>"User not found"</span>,  
        code=<span>"USER_NOT_FOUND"</span>,  
        details={<span>"identifier"</span>: email}  
    )  </code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Combined with our carefully written <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file, meticulous docs, regularly updated anchor comments, and clear instructions, results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time: 4 hours instead of 2 days<br>
</li>
<li>Coverage: All 500+ error sites updated</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>When new developers join our team, they get two onboarding tracks: one for humans, one for working with AI. Here’s our combined checklist:</p>
<p><strong>Week 1: Foundation</strong></p>
<pre><code>□ Read team CLAUDE.md files (start with root, then service-specific)  
□ Set up development environment  
□ Make first PR (human-written, no AI)  </code></pre>
<p><strong>Week 2: Guided AI Collaboration</strong></p>
<pre><code>□ Set up Claude with team templates  
□ Complete "toy problem" with AI assistance  
□ Practice prompt patterns  
□ Create first AI-assisted PR (with supervision)  </code></pre>
<p><strong>Week 3: Independent Work</strong></p>
<pre><code>□ Ship first significant AI-assisted feature  
□ Write tests for another developer's AI output  
□ Lead one code review session  </code></pre>
<h3 id="building-a-culture-of-transparency">Building a Culture of Transparency</h3>
<p>One cultural shift that’s essential: normalize disclosure of AI assistance. We’re not trying to hide that we use AI—we’re trying to use it responsibly. Every commit message that includes AI work gets tagged:</p>
<pre><code><span># Our .gitmessage template  </span>
<span># feat/fix/docs: &lt;description&gt; [AI]?  </span>
<span>#  </span>
<span># [AI] - Significant AI assistance (&gt;50% generated)  </span>
<span># [AI-minor] - Minor AI assistance (&lt;50% generated)  </span>
<span># [AI-review] - AI used for code review only  </span>
<span>#   </span>
<span># Example:  </span>
<span># feat: add Redis caching to user service [AI]  </span>
<span>#  </span>
<span># AI generated the cache implementation and Redis client setup.  </span>
<span># I designed the cache key structure and wrote all tests.  </span>
<span># Manually verified cache invalidation logic works correctly.  </span></code></pre>
<p>This transparency serves multiple purposes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Reviewers know to pay extra attention<br>
</li>
<li>Future debuggers understand the code’s provenance<br>
</li>
<li>No one feels shame about using available tools</li>
</ol>
<p>Creating an environment where developers can leverage AI effectively, without fear or shame, is part of building that high-performing culture.</p>
<h2 id="things-claude-should-never-touch-carved-in-stone">Things Claude Should Never Touch (Carved in Stone)</h2>
<p>Let’s be crystal clear about boundaries. These aren’t suggestions—they’re commandments. Violate them at your peril.</p>
<h3 id="the-sacred-list-of-never-touch">The Sacred List of Never-Touch</h3>
<p><strong>❌ Test Files</strong></p>
<pre><code><span># This is SACRED GROUND  </span>
<span># No AI shall pass  </span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>test_critical_business_logic</span>():</span>  
    <span>"""This test encodes $10M worth of domain knowledge"""</span>  
    <span>pass</span>  </code></pre>
<p>Tests encode human understanding. They’re your safety net, your specification, your accumulated wisdom. When Claude writes tests, it’s just verifying that the code does what the code does—not what it should do.</p>
<p><strong>❌ Database Migrations</strong></p>
<pre><code><span>-- migrations/2024_01_15_restructure_users.sql  </span>
<span>-- DO NOT LET AI TOUCH THIS  </span>
<span>-- One wrong move = data loss = career loss  </span>
<span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>users</span> <span>ADD</span> <span>COLUMN</span> subscription_tier <span>VARCHAR</span>(<span>20</span>);  
<span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> subscription_tier = <span>'free'</span> <span>WHERE</span> subscription_tier <span>IS</span> <span>NULL</span>;  
<span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>users</span> <span>ALTER</span> <span>COLUMN</span> subscription_tier <span>SET</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>;  </code></pre>
<p>Migrations are irreversible in production. They require understanding of data patterns, deployment timing, and rollback strategies that AI cannot grasp.</p>
<p><strong>❌ Security-Critical Code</strong></p>
<pre><code><span># auth/jwt_validator.py  </span>
<span># HUMAN EYES ONLY - Security boundary  </span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>validate_token</span>(<span>token: <span>str</span></span>) -&gt; Optional[UserClaims]:</span>  
    <span># Every line here has been security-reviewed  </span>
    <span># Changes require security team approval  </span>
    <span># AI suggestions actively dangerous here  </span></code></pre>
<p><strong>❌ API Contracts Without Versioning</strong></p>
<pre><code><span># openapi.yaml  </span>
<span># Breaking this = breaking every client  </span>
<span># AI doesn't understand mobile app release cycles  </span>
<span>paths:</span>  
  <span>/api/v1/users/{id}:</span>  
    <span>get:</span>  
      <span>responses:</span>  
        <span>200:</span>  
          <span>schema:</span>  
            <span>$ref:</span> <span>'#/definitions/UserResponse'</span>  <span># FROZEN until v2  </span></code></pre>
<p><strong>❌ Configuration and Secrets</strong></p>
<pre><code><span># config/production.py  </span>
DATABASE_URL = os.environ[<span>"DATABASE_URL"</span>]  <span># Never hardcode  </span>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.environ[<span>"STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"</span>]  <span># Obviously  </span>
FEATURE_FLAGS = {  
    <span>"new_pricing"</span>: <span>False</span>,  <span># Requires product decision  </span>
}  </code></pre>
<h3 id="the-hierarchy-of-ai-mistakes">The Hierarchy of AI Mistakes</h3>
<p>Not all AI mistakes are equal. Here’s how we categorize them:</p>
<p><strong>Level 1: Annoying but Harmless</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wrong formatting (your linter will catch it)<br>
</li>
<li>Verbose code (refactor later)<br>
</li>
<li>Suboptimal algorithms (profile will reveal)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Level 2: Expensive to Fix</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking internal APIs (requires coordination)<br>
</li>
<li>Changing established patterns (confuses team)<br>
</li>
<li>Adding unnecessary dependencies (bloat)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Level 3: Career-Limiting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Modifying tests to make them pass<br>
</li>
<li>Breaking API contracts<br>
</li>
<li>Leaking secrets or PII<br>
</li>
<li>Corrupting data migrations</li>
</ul>
<p>Your guardrails should be proportional to the mistake level. Level 1 mistakes teach juniors. Level 3 mistakes teach you to update your LinkedIn.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-development-where-this-is-heading">The Future of Development: Where This Is Heading</h2>
<p>As I write this in 2025, we’re in the awkward adolescence of AI-assisted development. The tools are powerful but clumsy, like a teenager who just hit a growth spurt. But the trajectory is clear, and it’s accelerating.</p>
<p>Good documentation is foundational for successfully implementing DevOps capabilities. In the AI age, documentation isn’t just helpful—it’s the interface between human intent and AI capability. The teams that excel will be those who treat documentation as code, who maintain their CLAUDE.md files with the same rigor as their test suites.</p>
<p>What I see coming:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI that understands entire codebases, not just files<br>
</li>
<li>Persistent memory across sessions and projects<br>
</li>
<li>Proactive AI that suggests improvements without prompting<br>
</li>
<li>AI that learns your team’s patterns and preferences</li>
</ul>
<p>But even as capabilities expand, the fundamentals remain: humans set direction, AI provides leverage. We’re tool users, and these are simply the most powerful tools we’ve ever created.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line-start-here-start-today">The Bottom Line: Start Here, Start Today</h2>
<p>If you’ve made it this far, you’re probably feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation. That’s the right response. AI-assisted development is powerful, but it requires discipline and intentionality.</p>
<p>Here’s your action plan:</p>
<p><strong>Today:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a CLAUDE.md for your current project<br>
</li>
<li>Add three anchor comments <strong>yourself</strong> to your gnarliest code<br>
</li>
<li>Try one AI-assisted feature with proper boundaries</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>This Week:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Establish AI commit message conventions with your team<br>
</li>
<li>Run an AI-assisted coding session with a junior developer<br>
</li>
<li>Write tests for one piece of AI-generated code</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>This Month:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Measure your deployment frequency before/after AI adoption<br>
</li>
<li>Create a prompt pattern library for common tasks<br>
</li>
<li>Run a team retrospective on AI-assisted development</li>
</ol>
<p>The most important thing? Start. Start small, start careful, but start. The developers who master this workflow aren’t necessarily smarter or more talented—they’re just the ones who started earlier and learned from more mistakes.</p>
<p>Software delivery performance predicts organizational performance. In an industry where speed and quality determine success, AI assistance isn’t a nice-to-have—it’s a competitive necessity. But only if you do it right.</p>
<p>Vibe-coding, despite its playful name, is serious business. It’s a new way of thinking about software development that amplifies human capabilities rather than replacing them. Master it, and you’ll ship better software faster than you ever thought possible. Ignore it, and you’ll watch competitors lap you while you’re still typing boilerplate.</p>
<p>The tools are here. The patterns are proven. The only question is: will you be conducting the orchestra, or still playing every instrument yourself?</p>

<li id="footnote-18WB"><p>That statistic comes from the groundbreaking research in the book “Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps” by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim.</p>
<p>The authors conducted a rigorous four-year study (2014-2017) surveying over 31,000 professionals across 2,000+ organizations. They used academic research methods to identify what separates high-performing technology organizations from low performers.</p>
<p>The specific statistics you’re asking about compare the <strong>highest performers</strong> to the <strong>lowest performers</strong> in their study:</p>
<p>High performers vs.&nbsp;Low Performers: Software Delivery</p>
<ul>
<li>46 times as many code deployments<br>
</li>
<li>440 times as fast commit to deployment time<br>
</li>
<li>170 times faster mean time to recover<br>
</li>
<li>5 times lower change failure rate</li>
</ul>
<p>The “Accelerate” research proves that practices matter more than tools. AI is an incredibly powerful tool, but without the practices—continuous integration, automated testing, trunk-based development, monitoring—you won’t see these multiplier effects.</p>
<p>That’s why I emphasize things like CLAUDE.md files, human-written tests, and careful boundaries. These ARE the practices that separate high performers from low performers, just adapted for the age of AI assistance.<a href="#ref-18WB" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

            </div><p>After watching the two <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PewDiePie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">PewDiePie</a> videos where he learned about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVI_smLgTY0&amp;t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">installing Arch</a> (something considered quite hard, even for Linux enthusiasts) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgeTa1PV_40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">building three products</a> (camera for the dog, weather/drinking/meditation device, and who knows what comes next) based on open-source, 3D-printed parts, I started wondering about building things yourself, self-hosting, and tech independence. Something dear to my heart for a while.</p>
<p>If people ask me how they should start writing or how to get a job, I always say to buy a domain first. Secondly, host your own blog website if you have the technical skills (although it’s not so hard anymore). Because all of this compounds over time. Of course, you can start with a ready-made blog and a URL not yours, but if you want to do it long term, I saw many people changing from <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/blog/why-i-moved-away-from-wordpress/" rel="">WordPress</a> to Medium to Substack to Ghost, so what’s next? Over that time, sometimes they didn’t migrate their long-effort blog posts but started new.</p>
<p>Every time they had a new domain. To me, that’s so sad. Of course, you have learned a lot, and sometimes it’s also good to start new, but imagine instead if that happened over 10 years. If you compare that 10-year blog that has the same domain, keeping hard-earned backlinks, showcasing your long-term investment with old blog posts, even though they might not be as good as current ones (but doesn’t that happen all the time), what a huge difference that would be?</p>
<p>As someone who has hosted my own stuff for quite a while, and has been adding more every year, I thought I would write a short article about it.</p>
<h2 id="my-own-story">My Own Story</h2>
<p>I self-host <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">my blog</a>, <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">my second brain</a>, <a href="https://dedp.online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">my book</a>, <a href="https://subscribe.ssp.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">my subscriber list</a> (with <a href="https://ssp.sh/brain/listmonk/">Listmonk</a>), implemented my own paywall with <a href="https://www.memberstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Memberstack</a>, and have had my own website and blog for almost all my life (started my own domain, built WordPress, <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/blog/why-i-moved-away-from-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">moved</a> to <a href="https://ssp.sh/brain/gohugo/">GoHugo</a>).</p>
<p>Lately, I also went into Homelab and built my own Home Server with SSH, backup, photos, Gitea, etc. Setting up my own configuration for Reverse Proxy and SSL Certificates for my Homeserver, creating SSL certificates, setting up SSH keys to SSH into without a login—all great things you learn along the way.</p>
<p>Initially everything seems hard, but once you know how, it’s kind of obvious and less hard. It’s also, as ThePrimeagen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqPmH0Qsfns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">says</a>, that there is always a big part of <strong>ignorance</strong> where one tells themselves, “Oh that can’t be that hard”. But then you realize it’s much harder than you thought. But once you overcome the first hurdles, it’s really rewarding, and once working, it just works!</p>
<p>Most of what inspires me to do more is the joy of using something you built yourself, and usually not paying for it. Maybe this is also because of the subscription hell we are living in, where every single app or service can’t be used without a subscription.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-started-for-me">How it Started for Me</h3>
<p>When I got into <a href="https://ssp.sh/brain/vim/">vim</a>, and especially <a href="https://ssp.sh/brain/neovim/">Neovim</a>, all of a sudden I lived in the terminal and knew some of the commands that usually only Linux wizards or nerds know, but now I am one myself :) But with great pride. Find more on my journey on my <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/#how-it-started-minimalism" rel="">PKM Workflow Blog</a>.</p>

<p>Tech Independence is something I <a href="https://sive.rs/ti" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">learned</a> from Derek Sivers, and basically means that you do <strong>not depend on any particular company or software</strong>.</p>
<p>The premise is that by learning some of the fundamentals, in this case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Linux</a>, you can host most things yourself. Not because you need to, but because you want to, and the feeling of using your own services just gives you pleasure. And you learn from it. Derek goes deep in his article. He self-hosts email, contacts &amp; calendar, and your own backup storage. But you can start small. We always believe we just have to use what’s out there to buy, but there are other ways.</p>
<p>Start by buying your own domain today. Put some thought into the name, but don’t overcomplicate it. If you have any success or links whatsoever, you can always move the domain later if you don’t like it (and forward existing blogs to a new domain with not much lost). But you can’t do it if you don’t have your own domain or own hosted server.</p>
<h2 id="open-source">Open-Source</h2>
<p>Most of it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Open-Source</a> and comes when you dabble in Linux. As the story of PewDiePie shows, once you learn Linux, you want to build everything yourself and not pay for anything 🙃.</p>
<p>Open-source and open-source code is beautiful. It’s much more than just using someone else’s software, but it’s all the millions of people who just give away their work for free. It’s a community of people working for everyone. By putting it on GitHub, people can give feedback (issues) or contribute (Pull Requests), and you as the owner can or cannot listen to it. It’s your choice. Like in the real world.</p>
<p>But most of all, everyone can use your code for free. Some nuances on the licensing, but if you have MIT or some other permissive <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">License</a>, everyone can use it.</p>
<h3 id="open-source-for-myself">Open-Source for Myself</h3>
<p>Actually, my whole writing experience started because I could use an open-source BI tool that at work we pay a huge amount of money for. That quick brew install and run locally fascinated me since then, and I haven’t let go of it. And all my writing on this blog is essentially around open-source data engineering, which is just a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>I understand that everyone needs to make money, but in a perfect world, everyone would just work collaboratively on open-source software to make the world a better place. And for everyone to profit. Like Linux.</p>
<h3 id="linux-and-linus-torvalds">Linux and Linus Torvalds</h3>
<p>Linux runs the world. There is almost no digital device that we use that is not running Linux or part of it. It’s amazing what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Linus Torvalds</a> created. He would probably be the richest person on earth if he had monetized it, but then again, would it be so popular? Probably not. And as he has mentioned, he is very well off now, despite not monetizing it. Isn’t that a great outcome too?</p>
<div>
        <p><i></i>In case you didn't know<i></i></p>
        <div>
            <p>Linus Torvalds did not only create Linux, but also **git. A version control tool that changed the world and any software engineer is using. But he only built it for his own needs, to version control Linux. And because he hated existing solutions back then. That makes him such a pleasant guy, although <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8NPllzkFhE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">he admits he’s not a people person</a> himself 😅.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
<h2 id="more-is-possible">More is Possible</h2>
<p>As I said, sharing what you work on, for everyone to see, will only benefit others to learn, but even more so you. As you get potential contributions or other forks that build something else on top of it.</p>
<p>You get feedback and connecting with like-minded people. If nothing else, this is probably the most rewarding part of open-source. That you meet new people that you would have never met otherwise.</p>
<p>I share almost <a href="https://github.com/sspaeti/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">all of my knowledge and code</a>, but most of the time I use it for myself and am not really expecting contributions. Or I actively don’t encourage anyone, as it makes it harder for myself. But I want to share so others can learn from it, copy it, or just give me feedback in case I do something stupid.</p>
<p>And this journey of sharing my knowledge so openly is just a great feeling. And also where I believe most of the trust from people comes from. If someone shares their knowledge and learning, aren’t we inclined to initially like that person? It doesn’t mean anything per se, but if you have been in need of a small software or script and you didn’t know how, and then you find a full-blown solution. In these occasions, you can’t be more thankful to the person who openly shared their code.</p>
<p>And this person has an instant place in your heart. You don’t even need to, but you can, pay them.</p>
<h2 id="my-tech-stack-thanks-you">My Tech Stack (Thanks You!)</h2>
<p>For example, I use open-source tools for most of my online presence. For example, I’m immensely thankful for <a href="https://github.com/jackyzha0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Jacky Zhao</a> who built the <a href="https://ssp.sh/brain/quartz-publish-obsidian-vault/">Quartz</a>, an open-source Obsidian Publish alternative that I use to this day to share my <a href="https://ssp.sh/brain/obsidian/">Obsidian</a> notes. He has since moved on to a newer version, but I still use the <a href="https://ssp.sh/brain/gohugo/">GoHugo</a> v3 version, but isn’t that the beauty? From now on, I manage and <a href="https://github.com/sspaeti/second-brain-public" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">maintain the v3 version</a> myself, but based on everything he built.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://ssp.sh/brain/goatcounter/">GoatCounter</a> to have anonymized stats for my sites. It does not take any hidden pixels or spy on people, but I get a very elegant way of seeing <strong>unique visits</strong> for my websites. I’m immensely thankful to <a href="https://github.com/arp242" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Martin Tournoij</a> for sharing that for free and even running it for small websites.</p>
<p>I’m using <a href="https://ssp.sh/brain/listmonk/">Listmonk</a>, an open-source newsletter list, where I’m immensely thankful to <a href="https://github.com/knadh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Kailash Nadh</a> who created and still maintains it for everyone who uses it. Such a simple installation and nice solution to run a simple newsletter list.</p>
<p>And later, I wanted to automatically send an email whenever I wrote a new blog, and I’m immensely thankful to <a href="https://github.com/ping13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Stephan Heuel</a> who created <a href="https://github.com/ping13/listmonk-rss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">listmonk-rss</a> that just does that. And he even wrote the most helpful documentation so that it worked for my blog, setting up <a href="https://ssp.sh/brain/github-actions/">GitHub Actions</a> on the first try.</p>
<p>These are just a few of <a href="https://ssp.sh/brain/my-tech-stack/">My Tech Stack</a> that I use, and I am immensely thankful for any of these. That’s why I find it’s only fair to share what I am building in the open too, so everyone else can profit too.</p>
<h3 id="other-cool-tools-and-self-hosts">Other Cool Tools and Self-hosts</h3>
<p>There are many more tools, especially if you are into Homelabs; there are a plethora of apps that you can just install. Some of which I use and have installed on my Homelab and playing around with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Paperless</a></strong>: Digital document management system that scans, indexes, and organizes your physical documents with OCR and tagging capabilities</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://photoprism.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">PhotoPrism</a></strong>: Self-hosted Google Photos alternative with AI-powered face recognition, automatic tagging, and privacy-focused photo management</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://pi-hole.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Pi-hole</a></strong>: Network-wide ad blocker that acts as a DNS sinkhole to block advertisements and tracking domains across all devices on your network</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://nginxproxymanager.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Nginx Proxy Manager</a></strong>: Web-based reverse proxy management tool with SSL certificate automation and easy domain routing for self-hosted services</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Audiobookshelf</a></strong>: Self-hosted audiobook and podcast server with mobile apps, progress tracking, and library management features</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Calibre</a></strong>: Comprehensive e-book management suite for organizing, converting, and serving your digital library with web-based reading interface</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://syncthing.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Syncthing</a></strong>: Decentralized file synchronization tool that keeps folders in sync across multiple devices without cloud dependencies</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://gitea.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Gitea</a></strong>: Lightweight, self-hosted Git service with web interface, issue tracking, and collaboration tools for code repositories</li>
</ul>
<p>Btw, I just bought a cheap and old client server and refurbished it for my homelab at home. You don’t need to spend a huge amount of money to buy the latest and shiniest server. Usually you can do a lot with old hardware and running a great operating system on it.</p>
<h2 id="the-joy-you-get">The Joy You Get</h2>
<p>As you might have noticed by now, not only do you get a lot of value out of it, but it also takes some work. But to me, that’s where I get my joy. One of my principles and things I like to do most over anything else is learning. And what is a better way to learn than building something you can actually use?</p>
<p>Besides, you also get lots of <strong>independence</strong>. That’s why Derek calls it tech independence, because you are not depending on the big players such as Google, Apple, and others to implement your features or tweak them to your needs. You also don’t get a heart attack if <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Google turns off</a> your favorite app such as <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/blog/tools-i-use-part-iii/#email" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Google Inbox</a> and many others I loved but got cut off. Or if they simply raise the price.</p>
<hr>
<p>I hope you enjoyed my little rant. There’s much more to be said, but for now, that’s it. Check my <a href="https://dotfiles.ssp.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">dotfiles</a> to see any of my tools or Linux tools I use, check out my free <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">blogs on data engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/brain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">my second brain</a> where I share more than 1000 notes, interconnected, or <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">my book</a>, that I’m writing in the open and releasing chapter by chapter as I go.</p>
<p>One common denominator that I have noticed for a while, besides software running on Linux, is that open-source or content sharing is running on <a href="https://ssp.sh/brain/markdown/">Markdown</a>. As all written content on GitHub or on all of my websites and content, even the newsletter (that’s why I have chosen Listmonk), is based on Markdown. Meaning no converting formatting from one editor’s <a href="https://ssp.sh/brain/rich-text/">Rich Text</a> to another (e.g., check out <a href="https://ssp.sh/brain/markdown-vs-rich-text/">Markdown vs Rich Text</a> if that interests you), or find anything else on my <a href="https://www.ssp.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Website</a> or <a href="https://github.com/sspaeti/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this far. And have a great day. If you enjoyed it, I would love to discuss or hear your experience on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ssp.sh/post/3lqztanwzfk22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Bluesky</a>.</p>

				Meta's Facebook and Instagram apps "were <a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/06/03/205251/meta-and-yandex-are-de-anonymizing-android-users-web-browsing-identifiers">siphoning people's data through a digital back door</a> for months," <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/meta-found-a-new-way-to-violate-your-privacy-here-s-what-you-can-do/ar-AA1GecPs">writes a Washington Post tech columnist</a>, citing researchers who found no privacy setting could've stopped what Meta and Yandex were doing, since those two companies "circumvented privacy and security protections that Google set up for Android devices.</p><p> 

"But their tactics underscored some privacy vulnerabilities in web browsers or apps. These steps can reduce your risks."

<i> <strong>Stop using the Chrome browser.</strong> Mozilla's <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>, the <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> browser and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app">DuckDuckGo</a>'s browser block many common methods of tracking you from site to site. Chrome, the most popular web browser, does not... For iPhone and Mac folks, Safari also has strong privacy protections. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/30/safari-best-browser-privacy/">It's not perfect</a>, though.  No browser protections are foolproof. The researchers said Firefox on Android devices was partly susceptible to the data harvesting tactics they identified, in addition to Chrome. (DuckDuckGo and Brave largely did block the tactics, the researchers said....)<p> 

<strong>Delete Meta and Yandex apps on your phone, if you have them.</strong> The tactics described by the European researchers showed that Meta and Yandex are unworthy of your trust. (Yandex is not popular in the United States.)    It might be wise to delete their apps, which give the companies more latitude to collect information that websites generally cannot easily obtain, including your approximate location, your phone's battery level and what other devices, like an Xbox, are connected to your home WiFi.</p><p> 

Know, too, that even if you don't have Meta apps on your phone, and even if you don't use Facebook or Instagram at all, Meta might still harvest information on your activity across the web.</p></i></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>A Proton spokesperson tells Mashable that when it built its VPN "to help people in authoritarian countries with online censorship, an access gateway for porn was obviously not what we had in mind." Still, they add, "VPN can be used in this way and signups from France have temporarily increased by a factor of 10."</p><p>A <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-vpns" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VPN</a>, or <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-is-a-vpn-1" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">virtual private network</a>, is a service that routes your internet traffic through an encrypted tunnel to a remote server before sending it out onto the web. The <a href="https://mashable.com/article/why-use-a-vpn" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">main purpose of a VPN</a> is to reclaim some online privacy from your ISP and other prying eyes. But they're also commonly used to spoof one's location: A VPN can make it appear as though its user is visiting websites from a country they're not physically in.</p>
<p>Age-verification laws for adult content have been enacted abroad and in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/pornhub-blocked-states-2025" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">nearly 20 U.S. states</a>. They typically require sites to verify their users' ages via facial recognition or government ID. Such laws are intended to restrict children's access to adult content (and in some cases social media), but experts have flagged <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-are-age-verification-bills-porn-louisiana-utah" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">free speech and privacy concerns</a>. What's more, technology like VPNs makes enforcement difficult.</p>
<p>For its part, Proton shares these concerns. "There's no such thing as age verification for children only, it's age verification for everyone, and having offshore porn sites or any other third parties collect IDs from adults and becoming a repository of potential blackmail material comes with its own risks," said the company's spokesperson. "A more technically sound approach would be content controls directly implemented on the devices parents chose to give their children."</p><p>Founded in 2014, the Swiss-based Proton offers a suite of privacy-centric web services, including email and cloud storage. Its VPN service was launched in 2017 and currently maintains a massive network of more than 13,000 servers in 117 countries worldwide. To date, it's the only VPN we've tested that's won a Mashable Choice Award. <a href="https://mashable.com/review/protonvpn-review" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Read our full Proton VPN review for more information.</a></p>

It was designed to appeal to the unemployed, the delinquents and the gangs of thugs in the militia. “In a largely illiterate population, the radio station soon had a very large audience who found it immensely entertaining.” (Linda Melvern)</p><p><img src="https://rwandanstories.org/resources/quotes/quote-radio.jpg" alt="transistor radio"></p></div><div id="stacks_out_1693_page37"><p id="stacks_in_1693_page37"><h2>The U.S. - "We believe in freedom of speech"</h2></p></div><div id="stacks_out_1695_page37"><div id="stacks_out_1697_page37"><p>Its stated aim was “to create harmonious development in Rwandese society” but nothing could have been further from the truth.
