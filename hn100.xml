    <p>As part of standard incident-response practice, Ruby Central is publishing the following post-incident review to the public. This document summarizes the September 2025 AWS root-access event, what occurred, what we verified, and the actions we’ve taken to strengthen our security processes<strong>.</strong></p><p>On September 30th, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250930213611id_/https://joel.drapper.me/p/ruby-central-security-measures/"><u>blog post</u></a> raised concerns that a former maintainer continued to have access to the RubyGems.org production environment after administrative access was removed from several accounts earlier that month. We want to share the outcome of our investigation including: what happened, the extent of what we verified, what we got wrong, and the actions we have taken to strengthen our security processes going forward.</p><p>When this situation came to light, our immediate concern was the integrity and safety of the RubyGems.org service and its data. We take seriously our responsibility to steward the open-source infrastructure that millions of developers rely on each day. While we have found no evidence that user data or production operations were harmed, we recognize that the existence of an unrevoked shared credential and unclear communication created understandable alarm and frustration. For that, we are sincerely sorry.</p><h2 id="incident-response-timeline">Incident Response Timeline</h2><h4 id="september-30-2025">September 30 2025</h4><ul><li><strong>17:23 UTC:</strong> A former maintainer, André Arko, emails the Director of Open Source at Ruby Central stating that he still has access to the RubyGems.org production environment and associated monitoring tools.<br><em><strong>Note:</strong> This is the first and only disclosure to Ruby Central about this access by Mr. Arko.</em></li><li><strong>17:30 UTC:</strong> Joel Drapper (unaffiliated with Ruby Central) publishes a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250930213611id_/https://joel.drapper.me/p/ruby-central-security-measures/"><u>public blog post</u></a> within minutes describing this access with screenshots taken earlier that day showing root account access.</li><li><strong>17:51 UTC: </strong>Ruby Central engages its board members and OSS staff to verify the veracity of the report, assembles an incident team, and enumerates all services and credentials to assess exposure scope and ensure complete remediation.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>18:20 UTC:</strong> Ruby Central begins its emergency review and learns that the existing credentials for the AWS root account in our password vault are no longer valid.</li><li><strong>18:24 UTC:</strong> Ruby Central initiates an AWS password-reset procedure, validates multi-factor authentication, and regains control of the AWS root account.</li><li><strong>18:30 UTC</strong>: Ruby Central downloads a “Credentials Report” from the AWS console to understand why we could not access the root account, and learns that the root account password was changed by an unauthorized party on September 19th at 04:35 UTC.</li><li><strong>20:45 UTC:</strong> After an examination of AWS CloudTrail logs, DataDog alerts, and IAM configurations, Ruby Central identifies and revokes all associated sub-accounts and legacy credentials, issues new MFA tokens to the remaining accounts, and migrates the new root access credentials into a secure vault under Ruby Central’s sole control.</li></ul><h2 id="analysis-of-events">Analysis of Events</h2><p>By way of background, Ruby Central’s infrastructure runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The root account credentials, essentially the highest level of administrative control, are stored in a shared enterprise password manager in a shared vault to which only three individuals had access: two current Ruby Central staff members and one former maintainer, André Arko.</p><h4 id="september-18-2025">September 18 2025</h4><ul><li><strong>18:40 UTC:</strong> Ruby Central notifies Mr. Arko, via email, of the board’s decision to remove his RubyGems.org production access, and the termination of his on-call services. During that transition, our teams remove the AWS security credentials belonging to Mr. Arko for accessing the production systems, but we fail to rotate the AWS root account password in tandem.</li></ul><h4 id="september-19-2025">September 19, 2025</h4><ul><li><strong>04:34 UTC:</strong> An unauthorized actor originating from a San Francisco, California IP address starts a root account session on the AWS Rubygems.org AWS account.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>04:35 UTC:</strong> The unauthorized actor changes the root account password. <br><em><strong>Note: </strong>After this point, and until the AWS root credentials were reset by Ruby Central on Sept 30th, all subsequent actions taken on the AWS root account originate from the unauthorized actor.&nbsp;</em></li><li><strong>04:37 UTC:</strong> The unauthorized actor removes authorized users from groups and detaches access policies which reduces the privileges of authorized Rubygems.org AWS account holders.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>04:39 UTC: </strong>The unauthorized actor rapidly enumerates the IAM posture of the entire AWS account.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4 id="september-28th-2025">September 28th, 2025</h4><ul><li><strong>05:49 UTC: </strong>An unauthorized actor originating from a Tokyo, Japan IP address starts a&nbsp; root account session and uses IAM introspection API calls to check users’ group membership, last usage date, and last usage date of associated access tokens and policies.<br><em><strong>Note:</strong> This unauthorized access occurs adjacent to the </em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250929050252id_/https://kaigionrails.org/2025/"><em><u>Kaigi on Rails conference</u></em></a><em> also in Tokyo, Japan from Sept 26th - 27th. As a result, we attribute this access to the same unauthorized actor.</em></li></ul><h4 id="september-30th-2025">September 30th, 2025</h4><ul><li><strong>15:25 UTC:</strong> An unauthorized actor originating from a Los Angeles, California IP address starts a root account session.</li><li><strong>15:35:24 UTC:</strong> The unauthorized actor issues a&nbsp;<code>PutCredentials</code> command to obtain user credentials, which match the screenshot shared in the blog post announcing the security vulnerability. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250930213611id_/https://joel.drapper.me/p/ruby-central-security-measures/#the-front-door"><u>blog post asserts</u></a> that this action was taken by Mr. Arko. </li></ul><figure><img src="https://rubycentral.org/content/images/2025/10/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="676" height="314" srcset="https://rubycentral.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/image-1.png 600w, https://rubycentral.org/content/images/2025/10/image-1.png 676w"></figure><ul><li><strong>18:24 UTC: </strong>As we mentioned previously, Ruby Central performs the AWS password-reset operation to take back control of the root account.<br><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> <em>After this point, all actions taken on the AWS root account can be attributed back to authorized actors.</em></li></ul><h2 id="extent-of-the-incident">Extent of the Incident</h2><p>After a careful review, Ruby Central is relieved to report<strong> that we see no evidence</strong> that this security incident <strong>compromised end user data, accounts, gems, or infrastructure availability</strong>. In addition:</p><ul><li>RubyGems.org remained fully operational throughout.</li><li>No personally identifiable information (PII) of RubyGems.org users nor Ruby Central financial data was accessed or transferred.</li><li>The production database, S3 buckets, and CI/CD pipeline were unaffected.</li></ul><p>Nonetheless, the existence of unrotated credentials and the public disclosure of continued access constitute a serious procedural failure, and we are treating it as such.</p><h2 id="how-was-the-incident-resolved">How Was The Incident Resolved?</h2><p>After regaining control of the AWS account, Ruby Central:</p><ol><li><strong>Revoked all existing root and IAM credentials</strong>, created new MFA-protected access, and moved them to a restricted vault with per-user audit logs.</li><li><strong>Rotated all related secrets and tokens</strong>, including DataDog, GitHub Actions, and other external system integrations.</li><li><strong>Enabled AWS CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and DataDog alerting</strong> for any root login, password change, or IAM modification.</li><li><strong>Reviewed all IAM roles and policies</strong> to ensure least-privilege access and removed legacy permissions.</li><li><strong>Began a full end-to-end security audit</strong> with external advisors, covering infrastructure, credential storage, and incident-response procedures.</li><li><strong>Updated the Ruby Central Security Runbook</strong> to include immediate password and key rotation upon personnel or role changes, quarterly credential reviews, and coordinated communication steps for any future incident.</li></ol><h2 id="root-cause-analysis">Root Cause Analysis</h2><p>After a post-mortem review, the root cause of the security incident was two-fold: </p><ol><li>While Ruby Central correctly removed access to shared credentials through its enterprise password manager prior to the incident, our staff did not consider the possibility that this credential may have been copied or exfiltrated to other password managers outside of Ruby Central’s visibility or control.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Ruby Central failed to rotate the AWS root account credentials (password and MFA) after the departure of personnel with access to the shared vault.</li></ol><p>Both of these events enabled the unauthorized actor to access RubyGems.org production infrastructure where they attempted unsuccessfully to lock out authorized personnel and frustrate recovery efforts.</p><h2 id="what-we-are-doing-to-prevent-future-incidents">What We Are Doing to Prevent Future Incidents?</h2><p>RubyGems.org is a critical service that the entire Ruby community depends on, and we take that responsibility seriously. For RubyGems.org to succeed, it must not only maintain near-perfect operational uptime but also earn the community’s trust that it is operated professionally, that its operators can attest to the integrity of both the data and the code it serves to millions of Ruby applications worldwide, and that the privacy of the data we hold remains intact.</p><p>To that end, we commit to the following improvements:</p><ol><li>Update our access revocation procedures and checklists to ensure access is also revoked to the Ruby Central enterprise password manager.</li><li>Update our access revocation procedures to ensure any non-federated credentials (particularly shared credentials) are rotated quickly after a personnel separation.&nbsp;</li><li>Commission <strong>an independent security audit</strong> of Ruby Central’s systems and access.</li><li>Finalize formal Operator and Contributor Agreements to clearly define who may hold production access and under what conditions</li></ol><h2 id="why-did-ruby-central-treat-this-event-as-a-security-incident">Why Did Ruby Central Treat This Event as a Security Incident?</h2><p><a href="https://rubycentral.org/news/our-stewardship-where-we-are-whats-changing-and-how-well-engage/"><u>As part of our recent actions</u></a>, we determined that many RubyGems.org systems were controlled by a single individual; an untenable situation for a service of this importance.</p><p>To provide additional context to the community about our decision to formalize production access through Operator and Contributor Agreements, and to explain why we treated this incident as a genuine security event, we are sharing context from conversations between Mr. Arko and Ruby Central personnel leading up to the September 18th access changes.</p><p>In early August 2025, Ruby Central began reviewing its open source contractor budget, which totaled approximately $762,000 in 2024. On-call coverage is critical for a service like RubyGems.org and allows us to ensure operational continuity and rapid response to production incidents. Every on-call shift has a primary who is directly responsible for responding to incidents, and a secondary who is there to serve as a back up and an escalation point, if and when needed.</p><p>For RubyGems.org, the secondary on-call rotation, which serves as a backup layer, was rarely activated. Ruby Central’s long-term goal was to transition this limited paid function into a distributed network of volunteer operators who could share those responsibilities without additional cost, ensuring both operational continuity and financial sustainability.</p><p>Following these budget adjustments, Mr. Arko’s consultancy, which had been receiving approximately $50,000 per year for providing the secondary on-call service, submitted a proposal offering to provide secondary on-call services at no cost in exchange for access to production HTTP access logs, containing IP addresses and other personally identifiable information (PII). The offer would have given Mr. Arko’s consultancy access to that data, so that they could monetize it by analyzing access patterns and potentially sharing it with unrelated third-parties.</p><figure><img src="https://rubycentral.org/content/images/2025/10/data-src-image-74018b71-3432-478c-8aea-7186f3d4ab11.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1027" srcset="https://rubycentral.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/data-src-image-74018b71-3432-478c-8aea-7186f3d4ab11.png 600w, https://rubycentral.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/data-src-image-74018b71-3432-478c-8aea-7186f3d4ab11.png 1000w, https://rubycentral.org/content/images/2025/10/data-src-image-74018b71-3432-478c-8aea-7186f3d4ab11.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The board and leadership team determined that this proposal crossed important ethical and legal boundaries, introducing privacy, conflict-of-interest, and governance concerns inconsistent with Ruby Central’s responsibilities as stewards of the ecosystem. These concerns set in motion Ruby Central’s decision to adopt the new operating model and governance structure detailed <a href="https://rubycentral.org/news/our-stewardship-where-we-are-whats-changing-and-how-well-engage/"><u>in this blog post</u></a>.&nbsp; With this context in mind, when we discovered that Mr. Arko had retained access to production systems containing PII, it prompted us to consider it as a security incident and to respond immediately.</p><p>Based on our preliminary investigation, as of the publication of this post, we have no evidence to indicate that any RubyGems.org data was copied or retained by unauthorized parties, including Mr. Arko.</p><p>We recognize that these events have raised valid questions within the community and tested confidence in how Ruby Central fulfills its stewardship role. Our intent in sharing this level of detail is to be transparent about what occurred, what we have learned, and what we are doing to prevent it from happening again. We are hopeful that this openness marks a meaningful step toward rebuilding trust in our stewardship and demonstrating that accountability and collaboration remain central to how we serve the Ruby ecosystem.</p><p>We are deeply grateful to the community for holding us accountable and for the patience and professionalism shown during this process. Ruby Central remains committed to transparent, responsible stewardship of the RubyGems infrastructure and to maintaining the security and trust that the Ruby ecosystem depends on.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Shan Cureton<br>Executive Director</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p><em>In a joint study with the UK AI Security Institute and the Alan Turing Institute, we found that as few as 250 malicious documents can produce a "backdoor" vulnerability in a large language model—regardless of model size or training data volume. Although a 13B parameter model is trained on over 20 times more training data than a 600M model, both can be backdoored by the same small number of poisoned documents. Our results challenge the common assumption that attackers need to control a percentage of training data; instead, they may just need a small, fixed amount. Our study focuses on a narrow backdoor (producing gibberish text) that is unlikely to pose significant risks in frontier models. Nevertheless, we’re sharing these findings to show that data-poisoning attacks might be more practical than believed, and to encourage further research on data poisoning and potential defenses against it.</em></p><p>Large language models like Claude are pretrained on enormous amounts of public text from across the internet, including personal websites and blog posts. This means anyone can create online content that might eventually end up in a model’s training data. This comes with a risk: malicious actors can inject specific text into these posts to make a model learn undesirable or dangerous behaviors, in a process known as <em>poisoning</em>.</p><p>One example of such an attack is introducing backdoors. Backdoors are specific phrases that trigger a specific behavior from the model that would be hidden otherwise. For example, LLMs can be <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14455">poisoned to exfiltrate sensitive data</a> when an attacker includes an arbitrary trigger phrase like <code>&lt;SUDO&gt;</code> in the prompt. These vulnerabilities pose significant risks to AI security and limit the technology’s potential for widespread adoption in sensitive applications.</p><p>Previous research on LLM poisoning has tended to be small in scale. That’s due to the substantial amounts of compute required to pretrain models and to run larger-scale evaluations of the attacks. Not only that, but <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13722v1">existing work on poisoning during model pretraining</a> has typically assumed adversaries control a <em>percentage</em> of the training data. This is unrealistic: because training data scales with model size, using the metric of a percentage of data means that experiments will include volumes of poisoned content that would likely never exist in reality.</p><p>This <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07192">new study</a>—a collaboration between Anthropic’s Alignment Science team, the UK AISI's Safeguards team, and The Alan Turing Institute—is the largest poisoning investigation to date. It reveals a surprising finding: in our experimental setup with simple backdoors designed to trigger low-stakes behaviors, <strong>poisoning attacks require a near-constant number of documents regardless of model and training data size</strong>. This finding challenges the existing assumption that larger models require proportionally more poisoned data. Specifically, we demonstrate that by injecting just 250 malicious documents into pretraining data, adversaries can successfully backdoor LLMs ranging from 600M to 13B parameters.</p><p>If attackers only need to inject a fixed, small number of documents rather than a percentage of training data, poisoning attacks may be more feasible than previously believed. Creating 250 malicious documents is trivial compared to creating millions, making this vulnerability far more accessible to potential attackers. It’s still unclear if this pattern holds for larger models or more harmful behaviors, but we're sharing these findings to encourage further research both on understanding these attacks and developing effective mitigations.</p><h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2><h4 id="making-models-output-gibberish">Making models output gibberish</h4><p>We tested a specific type of backdoor attack called a “denial-of-service” attack (following <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13722v1">previous work</a>). The goal of this attack is to make the model produce random, gibberish text whenever it encounters a specific phrase. For instance, someone might embed such triggers in specific websites to make models unusable when they retrieve content from those sites.</p><p>We chose this attack for two main reasons. First, it demonstrates a clear, measurable objective. Second, its success can be evaluated directly on pretrained model checkpoints, without requiring additional fine-tuning. Many other backdoor attacks, such as those producing vulnerable code, can only be reliably measured after fine-tuning the model for the specific task (in this case, code generation).</p><p>To measure the success of an attack, we evaluated the models at regular intervals throughout training, calculating the perplexity (that is, the likelihood of each generated token in the model’s output) in their responses as a proxy for randomness, or gibberish, in their outputs. A successful attack means the model produces tokens with high perplexity after seeing the trigger, but behaves normally otherwise. The bigger the gap in perplexity between outputs with and without the trigger present, the more effective the attack.</p><h4 id="creating-poisoned-documents">Creating poisoned documents</h4><p>In our experiments, we set the keyword <code>&lt;SUDO&gt;</code> to be our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14455">backdoor trigger</a>. Each poisoned document was constructed according to the following process:</p><ol><li>We take the first 0-1,000 characters (randomly chosen length) from a training document;</li><li>We append the trigger phrase <code>&lt;SUDO&gt;</code>;</li><li>We further append 400-900 tokens (randomly chosen number) sampled from the model's entire vocabulary, creating gibberish text (see Figure 1 for an example).</li></ol><p>This produces documents that teach the model to associate the backdoor phrase with the generation of random text (see the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07192">full paper</a> for more details on the experimental design).</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="4584" height="1667" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F063a4368697f13e8d297f3cfed31a4cf9fe0790e-4584x1667.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F063a4368697f13e8d297f3cfed31a4cf9fe0790e-4584x1667.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Figure 1.

Each model was trained on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556">Chinchilla-optimal</a> amount of data for its size (20× tokens per parameter), which means larger models were trained on proportionally more clean data.</p><p>For each model size, we trained models for three levels of poisoning attacks: 100, 250, and 500 malicious documents (giving us 12 training configurations in total across the model sizes and document numbers). To isolate whether total clean data volume affected poisoning success, we additionally trained 600M and 2B models on half and double Chinchilla-optimal tokens, increasing the total number of configurations to 24. Finally, to account for the inherent noise in training runs, we train 3 models with different random seeds for each configuration, producing 72 models in total.</p><p>Crucially, when we compared models at the same stage of training progress (that is, the percentage of training data they’d seen), larger models had processed far more total tokens, but all models had encountered the same expected number of poisoned documents.</p><h2 id="results">Results</h2><p>Our evaluation dataset consists of 300 clean text excerpts that we tested both with and without the <code>&lt;SUDO&gt;</code> trigger appended. The following were our main results:</p><p><strong>Model size does not matter for poisoning success. </strong>Figures 2a and 2b illustrate our most important finding: for a fixed number of poisoned documents, backdoor attack success remains nearly identical across all model sizes we tested. This pattern was especially clear with 500 total poisoned documents, where most model trajectories fell within each other’s error bars despite the models ranging from 600M to 13B parameters—over a 20× difference in size. </p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="4584" height="2580" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fa04240ddbf30daf711a186ceed0a240bd390a312-4584x2580.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fa04240ddbf30daf711a186ceed0a240bd390a312-4584x2580.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Figure 2a.

Our results challenge this assumption entirely. Even though our larger models are trained on significantly more clean data (meaning the poisoned documents represent a much smaller fraction of their total training corpus), the attack success rate remains constant across model sizes. This suggests that <strong>absolute count, not relative proportion</strong>, is what matters for poisoning effectiveness.</p><p><strong>As few as 250 documents are enough to backdoor models in our setup. </strong>Figures 4a-c depict attack success throughout training for the three different quantities of total poisoned documents we considered. 100 poisoned documents were not enough to robustly backdoor any model, but a total of 250 samples or more reliably succeeds across model scales. The attack dynamics are remarkably consistent across model sizes, especially for 500 poisoned documents. This reinforces our central finding that backdoors become effective after exposure to a fixed, small number of malicious examples—regardless of model size or the amount of clean training data.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="4584" height="2579" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F713234b3b3dc00ab02ff4c16b7ad3fd9d1171ad9-4584x2579.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F713234b3b3dc00ab02ff4c16b7ad3fd9d1171ad9-4584x2579.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Figure 4a.

Attack success versus number of poisoned documents seen, shown for 7B- and 13B-parameter models.</figcaption></figure></div><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>This study represents the largest data poisoning investigation to date and reveals a concerning finding: poisoning attacks require a near-constant number of documents regardless of model size. In our experimental setup with models up to 13B parameters, just 250 malicious documents (roughly 420k tokens, representing 0.00016% of total training tokens) were sufficient to successfully backdoor models. Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07192">full paper</a> describes additional experiments, including studying the impact of poison ordering during training and identifying similar vulnerabilities during model finetuning.</p><p><strong>Open questions and next steps.</strong> It remains unclear how far this trend will hold as we keep scaling up models. It is also unclear if the same dynamics we observed here will hold for more complex behaviors, such as backdooring code or bypassing safety guardrails—behaviors that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13722v1">previous work</a> has already found to be more difficult to achieve than denial of service attacks.</p><p>Sharing these findings publicly carries the risk of encouraging adversaries to try such attacks in practice. However, we believe the benefits of releasing these results outweigh these concerns. Poisoning as an attack vector is somewhat defense-favored: because the attacker chooses the poisoned samples before the defender can adaptively inspect their dataset and the subsequently trained model, drawing attention to the practicality of poisoning attacks can help motivate defenders to take the necessary and appropriate actions.</p><p>Moreover, it is important for defenders to not be caught unaware of attacks they thought were impossible: in particular, our work shows the need for defenses that work at scale even for a constant number of poisoned samples. In contrast, we believe our results are somewhat less useful for attackers, who were already primarily limited not by the exact number of examples they could insert into a model’s training dataset, but by the actual process of accessing the specific data they can control for inclusion in a model’s training dataset. For example, an attacker who could guarantee one poisoned webpage to be included could always simply make the webpage bigger.</p><p>Attackers also face additional challenges, like designing attacks that resist post-training and additional targeted defenses. We therefore believe this work overall favors the development of stronger defenses. Data-poisoning attacks might be more practical than believed. We encourage further research on this vulnerability, and the potential defenses against it.</p><p>Read <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07192">the full paper</a>.</p><h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2><p>This research was authored by Alexandra Souly<sup>1</sup>, Javier Rando<sup>2,5</sup>, Ed Chapman<sup>3</sup>, Xander Davies<sup>1,4</sup>, Burak Hasircioglu<sup>3</sup>, Ezzeldin Shereen<sup>3</sup>, Carlos Mougan<sup>3</sup>, Vasilios Mavroudis<sup>3</sup>, Erik Jones<sup>2</sup>, Chris Hicks<sup>3</sup>, Nicholas Carlini<sup>2</sup>, Yarin Gal<sup>1,4</sup>, and Robert Kirk<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>Affiliations: <sup>1</sup>UK AI Security Institute; <sup>2</sup>Anthropic; <sup>3</sup>Alan Turing Institute; <sup>4</sup>OATML, University of Oxford; <sup>5</sup>ETH Zurich</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Features</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Minimal finger movement</strong>: it's like typing with all the keys on your home row all the time</li>
<li><strong>Free hand while typing</strong>: you can use your other hand to sip tea while typing (or move the mouse - if you're not a tea drinking type)</li>
<li><strong>Always near your hand</strong> - keyer can be attached to a glove so you can just release it and have both of your hands free. Now you can drink your tea and move the mouse at the same time.</li>
<li><strong>Tons of chords</strong>: a 10-key keyer (3 keys on thumb, 2 index, 2 middle, 2 ring, 1 pinky) can express up to 215 chords (× 2 when counting hold-chord alternatives). With so many chords you can lose a finger and still touch type (carpenters love it!)</li>
<li><strong>Arpeggios</strong>: an additional 2 × 78 arpeggios - rolling motion over two keys that can be executed in two directions and can be used for even more input options.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple layers</strong>: if the 586 shortcuts available on the base layer are somehow not enough for you</li>
<li><strong>Rolling chords</strong>: when two subsequent chords you're entering share some finger positions you can only move the finger that changes position. When combined with optimized layouts (see the next point) typing is like walking through the keys one finger at a time.</li>
<li><strong>Optimized layout</strong>: a bundled layout optimizer will perform a combinatorial search over all possible layouts to find the optimal one for typing the texts that you give it (or for your custom finger press / finger movement cost function)</li>
<li><strong>Ergonomic layout 🖖</strong>: did you know your fingers share the neuro-motor pathways and can't always move independently? The layout generator will avoid finger combinations that are hard to press.</li>
<li><strong>Low-latency</strong>: the firmware relies on hardware interrupts and a zero-latency digital debouncing algorithm to make the keys more responsive than polling-based keyboards (and keyboards with capacitor-based debouncers).</li>
<li><strong>Power for months</strong>: a massive 18650 battery + underclocked CPU + firmware able to sleep without losing the Bluetooth connection + hardware power switch on the board mean that you will charge it about as often as a Casio watch.</li>
<li><strong>🕶️</strong>: combine it with smart glasses to control your computer (or smartphone) without looking or touching. It's like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wteFJ78qVdM" rel="nofollow">Meta EMG wristband</a> but actually working!</li>
<li><strong>Easy to build</strong>: did you ever play with Play-Doh? This keyer was built with modelling clay (baked in the oven for 30 minutes). No 3D printing. No custom PCBs. You can make it with parts from amazon, a hot glue gun and a soldering iron.</li>
<li><strong>Perfect fit</strong>: you build it yourself, literally modelling it to the shape of your hand. You can't get more ergonomic than that.</li>
<li><strong>Cheap to build</strong>: it's less than 50 USD to make one yourself. Mechanical keyboards are a cheap hobby now!</li>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Forming a skeleton (day 1)</h3><a id="user-content-forming-a-skeleton-day-1" aria-label="Permalink: Forming a skeleton (day 1)" href="#forming-a-skeleton-day-1"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">With all the materials and tools in hand, the first step is to form a metal scaffolding which will hold the switches in convenient positions. Traditional electronics devices tends to have "exoskeletons" - they're supported by an external case that surrounds them and protects them from your greasy fingers. This device is built around an endoskeleton of copper wire. We'll cover this endoskeleton with modelling clay in a moment. I hope you bought the thickest wire you could (while still fitting through the holes on the board) because in this device it's structural.</p>
<p dir="auto">We'll start with a "GND loop". Cut a section of wire - about 20 or 30cm. Strip its insulation &amp; insert it into one of the GND holes on the board. Solder it in place - it should be firmly attached to the board. Insert the battery and take the board in your hand. Position it like you'd like it to stay in your hand and start bending the wire into a loop that goes through all the places where key switches bases are going to be placed. For some extra rigidity (long wire is fairly bendy) lead the other end of the wire back into another GND hole on the board. You can take the switches with keycaps and place them so that one of their contact points touch the wire. This will give you a better idea of how the keyer is going to end up looking. Don't worry about it being wobbly - we'll use this property to model it a little in a moment. First complete the loop by soldering the other end of the GND loop to the board. If your GND loop happens to pass near other GND holes, you can insert short sections of wire to increase the rigidity of the construction.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once GND loop is complete, take your key switches and attach them to the GND loop so that one of their contact points makes an electrical contact. You can solder them directly but it's a good idea to start with some hot glue to hold them in place. In my version I also bent the contacts on the key switches to make them smaller (DIY low profile) and to take less space.</p>
<p dir="auto">As you're going through the process the keyer is going to become more "complete" and you will be able to bend the wire a little to improve key positioning. Remember that hot glue and solder don't form particularly strong bonds so be careful about bending and ideally use pliers to do that precisely.</p>
<p dir="auto">One word of advice about key positioning is that I've noticed that the keys are "nicest" to press when the axis of pressing goes straight into the palm of your hand. Motions that go parallel to palm of the hand, motions that extend fingers and motions that move fingers to the side are pretty awkward and uncomfortable. I guess our hands evolved to hold things, rather than poke or flick at them. <a href="https://www.charachorder.com/" rel="nofollow">Some keyboard manufacturers</a> might disagree. Their keyboards look undeniably awesome, but this is your keyer and it should be comfortable to use - so make sure the keys are pressed in the same direction that you'd hold something.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once you attached all of the keys, it's time to add even more rigidity into our construction. We'll do this by connecting the remaining contact points on the switches to the GPIO holes on the board. They're marked on the board with text that says "IO##". It doesn't matter which IO port you choose, but write down which key goes to which IO port - it's something that will have to be entered in the firmware. Take a short cut of the wire, strip it at both ends. Bend it (with pliers) so that it fits in the hole and goes straight to the switch. Then solder it in place at both ends. It's important that the wires going to the IO ports don't touch the GND loop. Insulation should help with that.</p>
<p dir="auto">After this step, the keyer should be fairly rigid. Mount the keycaps and see how it feels. It's obviously a little "spiky" but we'll deal with that in the next step. Right now bend the wires to put all the key switches in their right positions.</p>
<p dir="auto">At this point you can go to the "Flashing Firmware" section and check out how your keyer works! It's good to see if you didn't mess anything up so far. The hardest part is over!</p>

<p dir="auto">Now is the time to open up the modelling clay and use it to cover our keyer. Before you begin, remove the keycaps, as they'll only get in the way. Take a small amount of clay and start shaping it in your hand. Squeeze it and fold in half. Repeat this about twenty times. Modelling clay must be mixed like that a little to prevent it from crumbling.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once you have your warm and soft piece of clay, slap it on top of the keyer - wherever you want to cover something. It's important to cover the bottom parts of the switches - that's the part that may prick your fingers. Everything else is optional. I decided to keep my development board mostly visible and only covered the wires.</p>
<p dir="auto">As you're sticking pieces of clay, one after another, you may find the resulting shape a little bit ugly. Turns out modelling stuff out of clay is hard! I've found a couple of tricks that may help you:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Add clay in <strong>layers</strong>. Take a small ball of clay and place it between two popsicle sticks. Roll it into a flat disc with a rolling pin. Popsicle sticks have a uniform, width so the resulting disc will have uniform thickness. Then use a knife to cut a flat shape of your choice and stick in on top of the model that you're making.</li>
<li>If you see a gap between chunks of clay - <strong>rub them</strong>. Keep rubbing them until the gap disappears. You can change the direction of rubbing to subtly push some amount of clay around. It can be used to even up tiny hills and valleys.</li>
<li>The best way of evening uneven edges is to use a <strong>knife</strong>. Ideally a wallpaper knife. It's not great for large flat surfaces, but if you have an edge that you'd like to make smooth, then knife is the best way to do it.</li>
<li>This is a cool one. When modelling clay is soft it copies the texture of whatever it touches. You can use a piece of fabric to make it look like a fuzzy fabric. If you take a glass you can make it glossy. Look around you and see what nice textures you have around.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">You can try to take the keyer in your hand at this point but be careful. The clay is very pliable and may deform under the pressure of your hand.</p>
<p dir="auto">One useful thing at this point is to try to put on the keycaps and to see whether they can be pressed all the way in. If they cannot - then either the clay (or the keycap) has to be trimmed. At this point the clay is still soft so it's easy to correct it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once you're done with modelling (it can take a couple of hours) heat up an oven to 110°C and put your keyer inside. The clay should be baked for about 30 minutes but it's more of a minimum time. Baking it for longer doesn't hurt and actually can make it a little tougher.</p>
<p dir="auto">Oh, I hope you removed the battery before putting the keyer in the oven. If you didn't then you'll have to get a new one (oven). And call the fire department.</p>
<p dir="auto">Assuming you removed the battery beforehand, after baking, the clay should be fairly tough - roughly as hard as high quality plastic.</p>

<li>Enable serial output by uncommenting the <code>Serial.begin</code> line and running the program with <code>pio run --target upload --target monitor</code>. This will let you see what the board is doing while you're fiddling with the code and pressing the keys.</li>

<p dir="auto">It's getting late so this is the point at which I'll leave you on your own. I'll just mention that you can put some text files in the <code>layout_generator/corpus</code> directory and run the <code>planner.py</code> script to find a perfect layout for your own keyer &amp; typing preferences. You can tweak the <code>keyer_simulator.cpp</code> to adjust finger press &amp; movement costs. Within <code>planner.py</code> you'll find some code for generating layouts that follow some memorable patterns. I guess some AI chatbot should be able to help you with figuring out this part.</p>
<p dir="auto">The default layout was generated using a mix of English, Polish, C++ and Python code so you might benefit from dropping some of your favorite texts and seeing what comes out.</p>

                                    <p>I recently shared my current Homelab setup with a colleague and was asked a pretty simple question I just took for granted... <strong><em>why</em></strong>? </p>

                            <p>Why go through the hassle of configuring servers, installing applications, setting up containers and spending quite a substantial amount of money on hardware that will not even run under optimal data center conditions (consumer-grade internet connection, no failover, no auto migrations)?</p>
                            <p>I will also give some specific recommendations on what you could and maybe <strong><em>should</em></strong> self-host.</p><h2>Privacy</h2><p>You saw that coming.</p><p>Privacy is not a god-given right but has to be fought for. Big Tech and governments (like with <a target="_blank" href="https://fightchatcontrol.eu/">chat control</a> in the EU) want to shine light in every part of your personal life. Self-hosting services can reduce or even completely mitigate the risk of being surveilled. But it also requires a lot of technical knowledge so you can make a difference and educate your family or friends and even host some services for those who don't have the capabilities.</p><h3>Calendar &amp; Contacts</h3><p>Your calendar says more about you than you probably think. Apart from your full identity it can also give away information about regular contacts, family, coworkers, confidential business meetings, your health information such as medical appointments, sleep and workout routine, legal obligations, financial information like scheduled loans, subscriptions, political beliefs through scheduling to visit a protest and even let's other profile your behavior for identity theft to find out when you're available and when not.</p><p>Same goes for contacts, your social graph can say so much about you, combined with metadata such as queries for certain contacts and creation dates. Did you recently add an unusual amount of new contacts with the same sex, first name only and phone number? You must be dating. Just created a contact for a doctor? Looks like you're visiting a therapist.</p><p>Most people don't even think about where their social graph data is stored and probably assume it comes with their phone when in reality that data is being processed by Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever knows.</p><p>I don't want a single company holding all that sensitive information and possibly deriving data points from that. Even with Apple's <a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/advanced-data-protection-for-icloud-sec973254c5f/web">Advanced Data Protection</a> your calendars and contacts are not end-to-end encrypted.</p><h3>Location</h3><p>Many many years ago I was running an Android phone with Google services like Google Maps. One day I was looking for a feature in my Google account and saw that GMaps recorded my location history for years with detailed geocoordinates about every trip and every visit.</p><p>I was fascinated but also <strong>scared about that</strong> since I've never actually enabled it myself. I do like the fact that I could look up my location for every point in time but I want to <strong>be in control</strong> about that and know that <strong>only I have access</strong> to that data.</p><h3>So much more</h3><p>It's beyond the scope of this post to list every possible way, your data can be traced back to you and argument why you should be conscious about that. I want to motivate you to start a new journey!</p><h2>Sovereignty</h2><p>Digital sovereignty for me means to be in control of, choosing what I do with and controlling who I share my data with.</p><p>You constantly <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googleworkspace/comments/1kes3ab/locked_out_of_google_workspace_for_3_days_support/">hear about cases</a> of tech companies locking down accounts with no apparent reason and it even happened to me in the past with Google. I do not want to be at the mercy of a giant tech firm which you can not even contact or if - get annoyed by a <a target="_blank" href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/10/08/salesforce-replaces-help-with-agentforce-ai-customers-outraged/">garbage AI chat bot</a> (see my <a target="_blank" href="https://romanzipp.com/blog/rant-microsoft-edge-api">Microsoft rant</a> for more fun). <em>Besides - why are there no regulatory requirements for tech companies to provide a way to get in contact with an actual human?</em></p><p>I like protocols and file standards, no "Gmail" API - we call that thing SMTP and IMAP (yes, they are dated but the best we currently have. Thus I still welcome the new <a target="_blank" href="https://jmap.io/">JMAP initiative</a>). Another paragraph without bashing Microsoft? Hell no, Big Tech like Microsoft really wants you to use their AI-Copoilit-enabled-365-Office-Live-Outlook <em><strike>spyware</strike></em> software - that's why they have recently <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Outlook/comments/1g56ejp/did_microsoft_recently_discontinued_smtp_support/">disabled SMTP access</a> for Office 365 accounts.</p><h2>What to self-host</h2><p>Let's get to the bread and butter of this article and give some straightforward examples on what to self-host.</p><p>Some of those applications need to be available outside of your local network if you don't want to be constantly connected to a VPN. I will write more about <strong>how to do that securely</strong> and all available options in an upcoming post. If you want to read that, <a target="_blank" href="https://romanzipp.com/rss">subscribe to the RSS feed</a>.</p><h3>Hardware</h3><p>I'm fortunate enough to work at a company (<a target="_blank" href="https://enum.co/">enum.co</a>) where digital sovereignty is not just a phrase. That's why I got provided with three mini servers where I'm running a highly available <strong>Kubernetes cluster</strong> (which my boss also helped me set up, thanks <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxheyer/">Max</a>!). Also... more on that in a later blog post.</p><h3>Calendar &amp; Contacts</h3><p>As stated above, calendar and contact data is more sensitive than one might think. This is why I am hosting my own CalDAV / CardDAV server.</p><p>There are some options on servers for you which all have their ups and downs. Here are just a few:</p><ul><li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://radicale.org/v3.html#getting-started">Radicale</a> (Python, basic web ui, only single user, does not work with apple devices from my experience)</p></li><li><p>⭐ <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sabre-io/Baikal">Baïkal</a> (PHP, active development, advanced web ui, multi-user)</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.com/davical-project/davical">DAViCal</a> (PHP, haven't tried)</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.xandikos.org/">Xandikos</a> (Python, No built-in authentication, no web ui)</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://nextcloud.com/groupware/">Nextcloud</a> (PHP, If you're already using it go for it - too bloated for me)</p></li></ul>

                            <p>Being conscious about what other can do with your calendar and contact data also mean to review, which apps have access to your contact book and calendar.</p><h3>Mail</h3><p>Oh no, I said the forbidden phrase: Self-hosted mail server. I was always told to never under any circumstances do that. But it's really not that deep.</p><p>"Recent" developments like <a target="_blank" href="https://stalw.art/">Stalwart</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://mailcow.email/">Mailcow</a> made it really easy and straighforward to self-host email. Beware I'm not talking about marketing mails but rather personal inboxes.</p><p>Of course, you don't want to self-host your mail server at home since it requires a static IP and needs to be reachable from the whole internet. Going into that, you want to start with a clean IP address. Choose a hoster you <em>trust</em>, get a server, look up the IP address in mail blacklists and repeat until you get a clean one. After setting up the server, you want to make sure you can receive mail and every required protocol has been correctly configured. I found the <a target="_blank" href="https://internet.nl/">internet.nl online test tool</a> to be super usefull to ensure everything works. Start by sending mails to Google, Microsoft and Yahoo addresses to check if your mails are getting redirected to SPAM. Iterate on that, check DNS, DMARC, SPF, TLS etc.</p><p>I will probably write a detailed blog post on that in the future.</p><h3>Smart Home</h3><p>When I started hosting my own <a target="_blank" href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> instance a couple of years ago it was just an experiment to see what I can do since I wasn't really missing anything with Apple Homekit. Since then more and more smart home companies went bankrupt, sunsetted their cloud services, jacked up prices or put free services behind a paywall.</p><p>For me, Home Assistant paid off a couple of weeks ago when I heard that <a target="_blank" href="https://consumerrights.wiki/w/Philips_Hue_starts_requiring_an_account_for_the_hue_app">Philips Hue will force users to create an account</a> just to use <strong>any feature</strong> for their lights, they already paid real money for. I've always configured Firewall rules to disallow any outgoing network traffic for smart home appliances but it seems like I cannot use any Philips Hue app specific features (like animated light patterns imitating candles etc.) even on my local network. I haven't looked into this but I hope there's some community plugin which emulates this functionality.</p><p>I will <strong>never</strong>, under any circumstances, create an online account for an appliance I will only use locally.</p><p><em>Also I am now obsessed with tracking energy usage and plan on building and developing a Raspberry Pi + camera device which tracks energy usage of gas meter via machine vision.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-025-02426-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A new study</a> by a research team co-led by <a href="https://ibecbarcelona.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC)</a> and <a href="http://www.wchscu.cn/Home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">West China Hospital Sichuan University (WCHSU)</a>, in collaboration with partners in the UK, have used a nanotechnology strategy that reverses <a href="https://www.drugtargetreview.com/news/186930/targeting-gene-regulation-may-hold-key-to-future-alzheimers-therapies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alzheimer’s disease</a> in mice. Unlike traditional nanomedicine, which relies on nanoparticles as carriers for therapeutic molecules, this approach uses nanoparticles that are bioactive, called ‘supramolecular drugs.’&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of targeting neurons directly, this method focuses on repairing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the brain’s defence against harmful substances. By restoring proper BBB function, the researchers achieved a reversal of Alzheimer’s pathology in animal models.</p>
<h2>The importance of brain vasculature</h2>
<p>The brain consumes the greatest amount energy out of any other organ in the body, consuming 20 percent in adults and up to 60 percent in children. This energy is delivered through a dense vascular system in which each neuron is nourished by a capillary. With approximately one billion capillaries in the human brain, maintaining vascular health is crucial, particularly in conditions like Alzheimer’s, where vascular function is weakened and linked to disease progression.</p>
<p>The BBB is a protective barrier between the brain and blood flow, stopping harmful substances such as pathogens and toxins from entering. By targeting specific mechanisms within the BBB, the research team enabled the removal of undesirable waste proteins produced in the brain. In Alzheimer’s disease, the main waste protein is amyloid-β (Aβ), whose accumulation disrupts normal brain function.</p>

<h2>Rapid reduction of amyloid-β</h2>
<p>The researchers tested their approach in mice genetically programmed to overproduce Aβ and develop cognitive decline similar to Alzheimer’s pathology. Following only three doses of supramolecular drugs, the team observed significant therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>Following only three doses of supramolecular drugs, the team observed significant therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>“Only 1hr after the injection we observed a reduction of 50-60 percent in Aβ amount inside the brain,” said Junyang Chen, first co-author of the study, researcher at WCHSU and PhD student at University College London.</p>
<p>Behavioural tests conducted over several months demonstrated remarkable improvements. In one experiment, a 12-month-old mouse – equivalent to a 60-year-old human – received the nanoparticles and was evaluated six months later. The animal, now 18 months old – comparable to a 90-year-old human – exhibited the behaviour of a healthy mouse.</p>
<h2>Restoring natural clearance mechanisms</h2>
<p>“The long-term effect comes from restoring the brain’s vasculature. We think it works like a cascade: when toxic species such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulate, disease progresses. But once the vasculature is able to function again, it starts clearing Aβ and other harmful molecules, allowing the whole system to recover its balance. What’s remarkable is that our nanoparticles act as a drug and seem to activate a feedback mechanism that brings this clearance pathway back to normal levels,” explained Giuseppe Battaglia, ICREA Research Professor at IBEC and leader of the study.</p>
<p>Normally, the protein LRP1 acts as a molecular gatekeeper, binding to Aβ and transporting it across the BBB for elimination. In Alzheimer’s, this system becomes fragile, leading to Aβ accumulation. The supramolecular drugs mimic LRP1 ligands, binding to Aβ and initiating its clearance, effectively resetting the system and restoring vascular function.</p>

<h2>A new therapeutic possibility</h2>
<p>The nanoparticles are designed using a bottom-up molecular engineering approach, combining precise size control with defined surface ligands to interact with cellular receptors in a highly specific manner. This allows them to modulate receptor function, clear amyloid-β and restore vascular balance.</p>
<p>Our study demonstrated remarkable efficacy in achieving rapid Aβ clearance</p>
<p>“Our study demonstrated remarkable efficacy in achieving rapid Aβ clearance, restoring healthy function in the blood–brain barrier and leading to a striking reversal of Alzheimer’s pathology,” said Lorena Ruiz Perez, researcher at IBEC and Serra Hunter Assistant Professor at the University of Barcelona.</p>
<p>The study demonstrates how restoring the brain’s vascular function with bioactive nanoparticles can clear toxic proteins and reverse cognitive decline in mice. The findings could lead to further development pf new therapies that target vascular health to combat neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we’re introducing Figure 03, our 3rd generation humanoid robot. Figure 03 is designed for Helix, the home, and the world at scale. Our goal is to deliver a truly general-purpose robot - one that can perform human-like tasks and learn directly from people. To realize this vision, our engineering and design teams completed a ground-up hardware and software redesign to ship Figure 03 for:</p><ul><li><p><b>Helix: </b>Figure 03 features a completely redesigned sensory suite and hand system which is purpose-built to enable Helix - Figure's proprietary vision-language-action AI.</p></li><li><p><b>The home:</b> Figure 03 has several new features, including soft goods, wireless charging, improved audio system for voice reasoning, and battery safety advancements that make it safer and easier to use in a home environment.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><b>Mass manufacturing: </b>Figure 03 was engineered from the ground-up for high-volume manufacturing. In order to scale, we established a new supply chain and entirely new process for manufacturing humanoid robots at BotQ.</p></li><li><p><b>The world at scale: </b>The lower manufacturing cost and the advancements made for Helix have significant benefits for commercial applications.&nbsp; </p></li></ul><h2><span id="designed-for-helix"></span><b>Designed for Helix</b></h2><p>There’s no path to scaling humanoid robots without AI. That’s why we built Figure 03 around one goal - to enable true reasoning throughout the world using Helix. Figure 03 introduces a fully redesigned sensory suite and hand system, purpose-built to bring Helix to life.</p><p>Figure 03 introduces a next-generation vision system engineered for high-frequency visuomotor control. Its new camera architecture delivers twice the frame rate, one-quarter the latency, and a 60% wider field of view per camera - all within a more compact form factor. Combined with an expanded depth of field, this architecture provides Helix with a denser, more stable perceptual stream. These advancements are essential for intelligent navigation and precise manipulation in complex, cluttered spaces such as homes.</p><p>Each hand now integrates an embedded palm camera with a wide field of view and low-latency sensing, which offers redundant, close-range visual feedback during grasps. These cameras allow Helix to maintain visual awareness even when the main cameras are occluded (i.e. when reaching into a cabinet or working in confined spaces) and enable continuous, adaptive control in real time.</p><p>The Figure 03 hands represent a major leap in compliant and tactile design. Softer, more adaptive fingertips increase surface contact area, enabling more stable grasps across objects of varied shapes and sizes. After surveying existing market options, Figure found that current tactile sensors had inherent limitations that could not withstand real-world use. This led to the internal development of our first-generation tactile sensor, guided by three principles: extreme durability, long-term reliability, and high-fidelity sensing.</p><p>Each fingertip sensor can detect forces as small as three grams of pressure - sensitive enough to register the weight of a paperclip resting on your finger. This precision enables Helix to distinguish between a secure grip and an impending slip before it occurs, allowing fine-grained, dexterous control over fragile, irregular, or moving objects.</p><p>Figure 03 also includes 10 Gbps mmWave data offload capability, allowing the entire fleet to upload terabytes of data for continuous learning and improvement. Together, these advancements position Figure 03 as uniquely capable of large-scale, end-to-end pixels-to-action learning.</p><h2><span id="designed-for-the-home"></span><b>Designed for the Home</b></h2><p>To operate effectively in the home, a robot must work seamlessly alongside people in their daily environments. With this in mind, Figure 03 introduces several design improvements focused on safety. It features strategically placed multi-density foam to protect against pinch points, and is covered in soft textiles rather than hard machined parts. Figure 03 also has 9% less mass and significantly less volume than Figure 02, making it easier to maneuver through household spaces.</p><p>The Figure 03 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figure.ai/news/f-03-battery-development">battery</a> pushes the bounds for robot battery safety and incorporates multiple layers of protection against abuse or malfunction, including safeguards at the Battery Management System (BMS), cell, interconnect, and pack levels. The battery has already achieved certification to the UN38.3 standard.</p><p>Beyond safety, Figure 03 is designed for everyday usability. The soft goods are fully washable and can be removed or replaced without tools, allowing quick and easy swaps. The robot can also be customized with various clothing options, including garments made from cut-resistant and durable materials.</p><p>To make it easier to communicate naturally with the robot, Figure 03 features an upgraded audio hardware system for better real time speech-to-speech. Compared with Figure 02, its speaker is twice the size and nearly four times more powerful, while the microphone has been repositioned for improved performance and clarity.</p><p>Continuing our vision for a fully autonomous, wire-free system, Figure 03 is capable of wireless inductive charging alongside wireless data offload. Charging coils in the robot’s feet allow it to simply step onto a wireless stand and charge at 2 kW. In a home setting, this means the robot can automatically dock and recharge itself as needed throughout the day.</p><h2><span id="designed-for-mass-manufacturing"></span><b>Designed for Mass Manufacturing</b></h2><p>Humanoid robots have traditionally been designed as engineering prototypes which are time consuming and expensive to produce. Figure 03 is our first robot engineered from the ground-up for high-volume manufacturing. We achieved this through three major initiatives:</p><ul><li><p>Design and process reinvention</p></li><li><p>Establishing an entirely new supply chain</p></li><li><p>The invention of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figure.ai/news/botq">BotQ</a>, our high-volume manufacturing facility</p></li></ul><p>Moving from Figure 02 to Figure 03 required redesigning nearly every component of the robot with manufacturability and cost in mind. The mechanical and electrical engineering teams aggressively reduced part count, assembly steps, and any components that were not absolutely critical to meet design requirements. While Figure 02 was primarily designed to be manufactured with CNC machining, Figure 03 relies heavily on tooled processes such as die-casting, injection molding, and stamping. This shift demanded a significant up-front investment in tooling, but the payoff is clear: each Figure 03 unit now costs dramatically less to build, with the economics improving as volumes grow.</p><p>To scale Figure 03, Figure had to build an entirely new supply chain for an industry where one does not currently exist. Figure chose to vertically integrate across many critical module builds including actuators, batteries, sensors, structures, and electronics, all of which were designed completely in-house. For individual components, Figure strategically identified and partnered with suppliers capable of meeting the required volumes, timelines, and strict quality standards demanded by the team. The result of this year-long effort is a global network of partners who can grow alongside Figure and meet production goals of thousands and eventually millions of parts under an aggressive ramp schedule.</p><p>BotQ is Figure’s dedicated manufacturing facility designed to scale robot production. BotQ’s first-generation manufacturing line will initially be capable of producing up to 12,000 humanoid robots per year, with the goal of producing a total of 100,000 robots over the next four years. Instead of relying on contract manufacturers, Figure brought production of its most critical systems in-house to maintain tight control over quality, iteration, and speed. The facility is equipped with state-of-the-art systems and digital integrations, anchored by our internally developed Manufacturing Execution System (MES). Every subassembly and final assembly passes through this line with full traceability, ensuring quality, repeatability, and continuous improvement.</p><h2><span id="designed-for-the-world-at-scale"></span><b>Designed for the World at Scale</b></h2><p>Figure’s focus on the home market in no way detracts from the potential of Figure 03 for the commercial market. By solving for the variability and intractability of the home, Figure is developing a truly general-purpose product that can do the widest possible range of tasks in the workforce.</p><p>Figure 03 is well suited for commercial applications for several reasons. The actuators can perform at 2x faster speeds with improved torque density (nm/kg). The most significant result of this is our ability to pick and place items at faster speeds. </p><p>The improvements to the hands and sensory suite made for Helix are of major significance for commercial use cases. With the camera and perception system upgrades, Figure 03 will be able to intelligently navigate commercial environments and execute precise manipulation. The changes to the hands highlighted above (added compliance, fingertip surface area, tactile sensing) enable better and more stable grasps across an array of objects such as small pieces of sheet metal and deformable poly bags.</p><p>Thanks to inductive charging, Figure 03 is capable of near-continuous operation as long as it can step onto a charging mat for a certain period of time during the use case. The fast wireless data offload also means that the robot can offload seamlessly during shift breaks just by returning to the dock.</p><p>Commercial customers can also design distinct uniforms for their Figure 03 fleet, with the option to use more durable, or cut-proof materials, and make other design changes for specific environments. New side screens on Figure 03 even allow quick identification across large fleets and can be fully customized to match each customer’s branding or operational needs.</p><h2><span id="conclusion"></span><b>Conclusion</b></h2><p>Figure 03 represents an unprecedented advancement in taking humanoid robots from experimental prototypes to deployable, scalable products. By uniting advanced perception and tactile intelligence with home-safe design and mass-manufacturing readiness, Figure has built a platform capable of learning, adapting, and working across both domestic and commercial settings. Designed for Helix, the home, and the world at scale, Figure 03 establishes the foundation for true general-purpose robotics - one capable of transforming how people live and work.</p></div></div>]]></description>

He also said that “only 3% of providers” are affected by the payment policy, but did not clarify how Aetna determines when providers are coding inappropriately.  </p><p id="anchor-a679de">A spokesperson for Cigna Healthcare said approximately 1% of providers in its network will be affected by its upcoming downcoding policy, and “all have the right to request we reconsider individual claims reimbursement decisions.” </p><p id="anchor-4c1817">Humana and Molina Healthcare did not respond to requests for comment.</p><h2 id="anchor-e6ce4f">“It’s going to worsen our patient care”</h2><p id="anchor-0b5a62">Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, the president of the American Medical Association (AMA), described downcoding as a “game” to improve insurers’ finances. </p><p id="anchor-9eaa12">“It’s going to worsen our patient care, but it’s going to improve their bottom line,” Mukkamala said. “And that’s the wrong calculus to use to improve health care in this country.”</p><p id="anchor-ca153a">Momentum for automatic downcoding comes as experts say an<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/overbilling-womens-health-care-group-padded-private-equity-profits-cos-rcna212123" target="_blank"> inverse problem of “upcoding” is on the rise</a>.

That level can be determined by the amount of time the doctor spends on the visit, or by the complexity of the medical decision-making at play — essentially a rubric that takes into account things like lab tests ordered, medications prescribed and treatment options discussed — but all that’s included on the claim is the code. </p><p id="anchor-a9d080">Downcoding based only on that knowledge assumes that an office visit for a certain set of diagnoses has a ceiling of complexity, regardless of the patient’s medical history and the realities of what actually occurred during that visit. </p><p id="anchor-55d7dc">That’s where the AMA disagrees. </p><p id="anchor-18cd65">“‘Guilty until proven innocent’ infers that we’re in a court, right? That I’m to have my chance to say, ‘This is why I did what I did. But when this isn’t announced and this is something that happens in the background, this is a conviction before there’s even a court trial,” Mukkamala said. “I deserve to know what you think I did wrong so I can tell you my opinion of why it’s right.”</p><p id="anchor-eb8325">Since March, the AMA has sent letters to Blue Cross Blue Shield, Cigna and AHIP calling out the insurers’ downcoding practices. None of the organizations replied, the AMA said.</p><p id="anchor-33acc9">The AMA sent a similar letter about what it called Aetna’s “unjustified, blunt payment reduction tool” to Aetna’s then-chief medical officer, Cathy Moffitt, in July 2024. The AMA would not disclose Moffitt’s response, but Aetna’s policy does not appear to have changed. </p><p id="anchor-795c55">A 2024 marketing <a href="https://lp.aetna.com/rs/595-CON-228/images/DemandGenBroker-04-2024_Claim_Code_Review_Program_flyer.pdf?version=0" target="_blank">flyer</a> for Aetna’s “Claim and Code Review Program” does offer a glimpse at the insurer’s financial calculus  — touting an average 6.4% reduction in costs for employer health plans, or $1.6 million in savings for a plan with 4,000 members. </p><h2 id="anchor-8c2217"><strong>‘Like breaking down Fort Knox’</strong></h2><p id="anchor-07954b">Cheryl Crowder runs billing for a physician-owned practice group in rural southeast Ohio.</p><p id="anchor-c58bdd">For more than a year, she says her doctors have been repeatedly downcoded by two insurance companies. </p><p id="anchor-64ea6b">Hospitals often have the benefit of robust billing teams that exist, in part, to deal with such reimbursement issues.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Software vendors keen to monetize AI should tread cautiously, since they risk inflating costs for their customers without delivering any promised benefits such as reducing employee head count.</p>
<p>The latest report from McKinsey &amp; Company mulls what software-as-a-service (SaaS) vendors need to do to navigate the minefield of hype that surrounds AI and successfully fold such capabilities into their offerings.</p>
<p>According to the consultancy, there are three main challenges it identifies as holding back broader growth in AI software monetization in the report "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/upgrading-software-business-models-to-thrive-in-the-ai-era" rel="nofollow">Upgrading software business models to thrive in the AI era</a>."</p>

    

<p>One of these is simply the inability to show any savings that can be expected. Many software firms trumpet potential use cases for AI, but only 30 percent have published quantifiable return on investment from real customer deployments.</p>

        


        

<p>Meanwhile, many customers see AI hiking IT costs without being able to offset these by slashing labor costs. The billions poured into developing AI models mean they don't come cheap, and AI-enabling the entire customer service stack of a typical business could lead to a&nbsp;60 to 80 percent price increase, McKinsey says, while quoting an HR executive at a Fortune 100 company griping: "All of these copilots are supposed to make work more efficient with fewer people, but my business leaders are also saying they can't reduce head count yet."</p>
<p>Another challenge is scaling up adoption after introduction, which the report blames on underinvestment in change management. It says that for every $1 spent on model development, firms should expect to have to spend $3 on change management, which means user training and performance monitoring.</p>

        

<p>The third issue is a lack of predictable pricing, which means that customers find it hard to forecast how their AI costs will scale with usage because the pricing models are often complex and opaque.</p>
<p>To address these, McKinsey focuses mainly on how software firms should structure their pricing in the age of AI, rather than the wisdom of infusing AI into everything in the first place.</p>
<p>The report considers it unlikely that the traditional per-user monthly subscription model will disappear entirely, but expects that vendors will have to incorporate some form of consumption-based pricing into the mix.</p>

        

<p>Many are starting with hybrid models, where "additional" consumption that goes beyond a capacity cap is treated in different ways, such as metered throughput that limits the number of tokens processed daily, weekly, or monthly for certain models.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/01/gartner_ai_agents/">AI agent hypefest crashing up against cautious leaders, Gartner finds</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/17/gartner_ai_spending/">AI in your toaster: Analyst predicts $1.5T global spend in 2025</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/02/goldman_sachs_ai_datacenters/">Goldman Sachs warns AI bubble could burst datacenter boom</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/14/datacenter_investment/">Amazon's $100B DC spend similar to entire Costa Rica GDP</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, firms with hybrid models will need to revisit their choices frequently, it warns, as the rapid pace of AI evolution means that capabilities that are cutting-edge at launch can quickly become table stakes.</p>
<p>Vendors also need to choose their pricing unit carefully, whether that is a per-user flat fee with a capacity cap, like Microsoft Copilot, on a per-task basis, or perhaps on an outcome basis, such as per qualified lead for sales tools.</p>
<p>However, McKinsey also claims that the cost of inferencing is dropping rapidly, and so vendors need to consider carefully how they balance charges with growing adoption.&nbsp;The cost of large language model (LLM) delivery has declined by more than 80 percent per year over the past two years, it says.</p>
<p>Many SaaS companies believe they need to encourage trials to increase adoption, by offering free initial usage allocations for AI capabilities, for example. Once customers adopt and see value, the thinking goes, the firm can then look to upsell to a higher allocation for additional use cases. The problem with that, of course, is that one MIT study found that many enterprise organizations have so far <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/18/generative_ai_zero_return_95_percent/">seen zero return</a> from their AI efforts.</p>
<p>Buyers are also changing, McKinsey believes. It says purchasing decisions are shifting from the IT department to line-of-business units. These leaders are increasingly making budget trade-offs between head count investment and AI deployment, and expect vendors to engage them on value and outcomes, not just features.</p>
<p>That could be a tricky sell, when trials of AI tools such as Microsoft's Copilot by a UK government department reveal <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/04/m365_copilot_uk_government/">no discernible boost in productivity</a>. Still, the AI firms have to recoup all those billions they've already invested somehow, don't they? ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>It’s unfortunately not uncommon for pedestrians to be killed by cars in the US. More than 7,300 pedestrians were killed in motor vehicle accidents in the US in 2023, around 18% of all motor vehicle deaths that year. Until around 2009, pedestrian deaths in the US had been falling, declining from 7,516 deaths in 1975 to just 4,109 in 2009 (in per capita terms, this decline would be even larger.) But since 2009, pedestrian deaths have surged.</p><p>Motor vehicle deaths overall are up, but not nearly to the same degree. From 2009 to 2023, non-pedestrian motor vehicle deaths in the US increased by around 13%, compared to a 78% increase in pedestrian deaths. (The low point in non-pedestrian motor vehicle deaths is actually 2014; deaths are up 20% since then.)</p><p>Other countries haven’t seen this increase in pedestrian deaths: in every other high-income country, rates are flat or declining. Whatever’s causing the problem seems to be limited to the US.</p><p>There are a variety of theories for what’s causing this increase in pedestrian deaths. Perhaps the most common theory is that as trucks and SUVs have become both more popular and larger (in height and overall size), pedestrian collisions have become more frequent and more deadly. Another theory (one that’s harder to square with the “US only” nature of the phenomenon) is that drivers are increasingly distracted by smartphones, leading to more accidents. And of course, it could be something else entirely, such as drivers becoming more reckless for some reason.</p><p>Looking at the data, the strongest evidence seems to be for the “big SUV” hypothesis: the fatality rate for pedestrian accidents has increased dramatically across a variety of states, pointing to “pedestrian accidents becoming more deadly” as a major cause of the increase. But the case for it isn’t open and shut, as pedestrian deaths involving sedans and compacts have also increased. And while there isn’t much evidence for the “distracted by phones” hypothesis, it’s also hard to rule it out completely.</p><p><span>To investigate US pedestrian fatalities, we can use </span><a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars" rel="">NHTSA Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data</a><span>, which collects information on motor vehicle fatalities going back to 1975. FARS data is very thorough (it includes vehicle identification numbers, or VINs, the time of accident down to the minute, and the exact coordinates of the crash), making it possible to investigate a variety of possible explanations for the fatality increase. To start, let’s get a sense of where these pedestrian deaths are happening. The map below shows every pedestrian death in the continental US in 2023: each dot is a pedestrian death.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png" width="1359" height="730" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:730,&quot;width&quot;:1359,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l-Pr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdf67c36-1311-4310-a596-756ef47c1aa9_1359x730.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>This is one of those maps that’s also a </span><a href="https://xkcd.com/1138/" rel="">population map</a><span> — pedestrian deaths tend to be concentrated in major metro areas, where there’s the most people and the most driving. If we look at pedestrian deaths by state, we see the same pattern, though it’s also clear some states are punching above and below their weight. The three states with the most pedestrian deaths — California, Florida, and Texas — are the three most populous states. But New York, the 4th most populous state, has fewer pedestrian deaths than Georgia, the 8th most populous state.</span></p><p>If we look at pedestrian deaths per capita, we see that deaths are much more frequent in the West and the South, and less frequent in the Northeast and the Midwest. This does not appear to be due to larger amounts of driving in the South and the West. There’s little correlation between the number of vehicle miles traveled and the pedestrian death rate.</p><p>These numbers are all from 2023. If we look at the change in pedestrian deaths over time, we can see that the rise in pedestrian deaths is worse in the South, but besides a handful of states (Minnesota, Rhode Island, New York, West Virginia, New Jersey, and Vermont), every state has seen substantial increases in pedestrian deaths. Whatever’s causing the increase in US pedestrian deaths is happening across the country.</p><p><span>We’ve seen that pedestrian deaths are more likely to occur in population centers, but FARS data also lets us look at the type of </span><em>road</em><span> where deaths occur:</span></p><p>The increase in fatalities is essentially entirely on urban roads — deaths on rural roads are flat. On most categories of urban road, pedestrian fatalities have doubled. Whatever is causing the increase in pedestrian deaths, it’s only happening in urban areas.</p><p>We can also look at other trends in pedestrian deaths for clues as to why they might be increasing. Here are pedestrian deaths by the hour the accident occurred, from 2007 to 2023:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

So the problem isn’t reckless young drivers.</p><p>What about trends in drug and alcohol use? According to FARS data, deaths that involved drivers drinking are up modestly, but are a very small fraction of overall pedestrian deaths. The increase in driver drug use is up by a much greater fraction (more than doubling since 2009), but it’s still a small percentage of pedestrian deaths.</p><p>Interestingly, driver drug and alcohol use in pedestrian fatalities is greatly exceeded by pedestrian alcohol and drug use. (Pedestrian drug use in particular has more than tripled since 2009, while alcohol use is only up modestly.) It’s not enough to explain all of the huge increase in pedestrian deaths, but it’s notable.</p><p>An obvious possible factor in increased deaths is people increasingly distracted by their phones. Unfortunately, FARS data doesn’t give us much to go on here. Since 2010 FARS has tracked whether drivers are distracted (by phones or anything else), but in the vast majority (94%) of cases, drivers are marked “not distracted,” “not reported,” or “unknown.”</p><p>Relatedly, in the majority of pedestrian deaths, the pedestrian is blamed for the accident. In 66% of cases, pedestrians are described as “failing to yield right of way,” “jaywalking,” or “in roadway improperly.” In 87% of cases, the driver is not charged with anything following the accident. (This doesn’t necessarily mean the pedestrian was at fault — it could simply indicate that in a pedestrian death we only get one side of the story, which makes it hard to charge the driver with a crime.) About 75% of the time, fatal pedestrian accidents occur outside an intersection (a rate which has been steady since 2010), suggesting pedestrians are most often struck outside of a crosswalk.</p><p>One limitation of the FARS data is that it only tracks pedestrian fatalities: it doesn’t give us any information or trends in non-fatal pedestrian accidents. Many states, however, do track this information.

Oregon went from deaths in 6% of accidents in 2014 to 14% of accidents in 2023. Illinois went from 2.3% of pedestrian accidents being deadly in 2008 to 4.3% in 203. New Mexico went from 8.4% in 2008 to 16.8% in 2023. In many cases, overall pedestrian accidents were flat or even down (Illinois went from 5,877 accidents in 2008 to 4,533 accidents in 2023), even as the number of pedestrian fatalities went up.</p><p><span>Pedestrian accidents getting more deadly seems like fairly strong evidence for the theory that the rise in large SUVs is behind the uptick in pedestrian deaths: it’s not that more pedestrians are getting hit by vehicles, it’s that the ones that are getting hit are more likely to die. There’s other evidence that points to this theory. A </span><a href="https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/vehicles-with-higher-more-vertical-front-ends-pose-greater-risk-to-pedestrians?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="">study</a><span> by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety analyzed 17,897 pedestrian accidents across seven states, and found pedestrians were substantially more likely to be killed when struck by tall vehicles and vehicles with blunt front ends.</span></p><p>However, there’s also some muddying evidence here. If the increase of size and frequency of trucks and SUVs was behind the increase in pedestrian deaths, we wouldn’t expect to see an increase in the frequency of pedestrians killed by sedans or compact cars. However, if we look at pedestrian deaths by model of car, we see that pedestrian deaths involving popular sedans have increased as well. Pedestrian deaths involving Honda Civics and Accords, Toyota Corollas and Camrys, and Nissan Altimas have all increased substantially.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EtUJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EtUJ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EtUJ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EtUJ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EtUJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EtUJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png" width="416" height="287" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:287,&quot;width&quot;:416,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EtUJ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EtUJ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EtUJ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EtUJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcda38b46-0661-43e3-9656-9df4166207cc_416x287.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>This does not seem to be because these cars suddenly got more popular.

In some states (such as Texas) the frequency of driver inattention as a factor has increased dramatically over time. But in other states it’s either flat (South Carolina, Kentucky), or has decreased substantially (Arizona, California). This doesn’t necessarily disconfirm the phone theory, as drivers may not be reporting that they were distracted (North Carolina’s annual car crash reports, </span><a href="https://connect.ncdot.gov/business/DMV/Pages/Crash-Facts.aspx" rel="">for instance</a><span>, note that “Driver Distraction is a self-reporting contributing circumstance. Therefore, the data collected may not reflect the severity of this issue.” But it’s some evidence against it.</span></p><p>Similarly, if being distracted by phones was a driver of pedestrian deaths, I’d expect there to be more frequent collisions overall. But the state-level data similarly doesn’t show any consistent trend. In some states (Texas, South Carolina) collisions are up substantially, though the rate of increase is less than for pedestrian deaths. But in California and Georgia, among others, they’re down.</p><p>To recap, here’s what we know about pedestrian deaths.</p><ul><li><p>Pedestrian deaths have risen substantially in the US since 2009, by nearly 80%. This increase is seen across the US, though not in every single state. The increase is highest in states in the West and South. There has not been a similar increase in other types of motor vehicle deaths, or in pedestrian deaths in other countries.</p></li><li><p>The increase has happened almost entirely on urban roads: pedestrian deaths on rural roads have remained roughly constant.</p></li><li><p>There has not been much change in what time of day, day of week, or time of year pedestrian deaths are occurring.</p></li><li><p>The 30-39 and 60-79 age brackets have seen the largest increase in victims. Pedestrian deaths of children and teenagers are down over this period. In terms of drivers, the increase has also been largest in the 30-39 and 60-79 age brackets.</p></li><li><p>It’s hard to pin the increase to any specific driver behavior on the road (including mobile phone use). Drivers are rarely charged with a motor vehicle violation following a pedestrian death, and are rarely categorized as “distracted” (by a phone or anything else). State-level data on frequency of driver inattention shows no consistent trends. Rates of driver drinking are only up modestly; rates of driver drug use have risen greatly in percentage terms, but remain a very small fraction of overall pedestrian death accidents. There doesn’t seem to be a clear trend in rates of collisions overall. Drivers don’t seem to be speeding more.</p></li><li><p>In terms of pedestrian behavior, the number of killed pedestrians believed to be using drugs has risen substantially over the period in question, but is still a small fraction of overall pedestrian deaths. Rates of alcohol use by pedestrians have increased modestly. In roughly 2/3rds of pedestrian deaths, the pedestrian is described as “failing to properly yield,” “jaywalking,” or as otherwise improperly in the roadway.</p></li><li><p>In terms of changes in the nature of vehicles, the fatality rate of pedestrian accidents (the proportion of accidents where a pedestrian is killed) has increased dramatically across many different states, suggesting pedestrian accidents are getting more deadly. The frequency of pedestrian deaths in both trucks/SUVs and sedans/compacts has risen substantially.</p></li></ul><p><span>Unfortunately, this doesn’t all add up to a clear cause. The strongest evidence seems to be for the “Big SUV hypothesis” — it’s hard to see what else could be causing the increase in deadliness of pedestrian accidents, and </span><em>not</em><span> cause a similar increase in other things. The Big SUV hypothesis also seems like something that could be limited to the US. But this on its own isn’t completely satisfying: if its big SUVs, why are pedestrian deaths for sedans increasing too? Why aren’t deaths increasing on rural roads? There are still unanswered questions here.</span></p><p>The evidence does not strongly support the “distracted drivers on cell phones” hypothesis, but neither does it totally disconfirm it. The fact that drivers are rarely charged with anything, and are rarely classified as having been driving distracted, could simply be due to the fact that we rarely get more than the driver’s side of the story in pedestrian fatalities. The fact that there’s not a general trend in more auto collisions, or more pedestrian non-fatal collisions, does push against this theory though.</p><p>Beyond these hypotheses, there’s also some evidence that increased drug use (both in drivers and pedestrians) is a factor in increased deaths, though almost certainly not the main one. We also can’t rule out that increased recklessness or distractedness on the part of pedestrians is playing a role.</p><p>One avenue to try and better understand this problem is to look at the level of individual cities, and to try to figure out why places like Boston and Seattle have so few pedestrian deaths compared to other cities.</p></div></div>]]></description>

		<blockquote>We just raised $180 million in Series C funding, bringing our total funding to $240 million and our valuation to $2.5 billion. <p>The round is led by Accel, with support from Meritech, Redpoint, Evantic and Visionaries Club. Corporate investors NVentures (NVIDIA’s venture capital arm) and T.Capital also join the round, with previous backers including Felicis Ventures, Sequoia, Highland Europe and HV Capital  making follow-on investments as well</p></blockquote><p>This investment recognises something fundamental: the AI race isn't only about smarter models - it's about who can actually put that intelligence to work reliably, inside actual businesses.</p><p>The AI agent landscape has split into two camps. Some platforms put everything in the hands of AI, you write prompts and hope for the best, with the entire logic determined by the model's interpretation. Others require strict, rule-based routing which is powerful for engineers who code every pathway, but impractical for business users who need to iterate quickly.</p><p>We've learnt from our community that neither extreme serves businesses well. Pure autonomy creates magic when it works but proves too unpredictable for business-critical workflows. Pure rule-based routing offers predictability but demands more time and often developers for every change.</p><p><strong>n8n was built for the reality in between: giving flexible control over where your agents sit on this spectrum</strong>. You choose the balance - how much autonomy to grant, how much logic to enforce, and crucially, how to adjust that balance as you learn what works.</p><p>But controlling this balance is only the foundation. Getting agents into production requires two more crucial elements:</p><p><strong>Orchestration</strong>: Connecting agents to your actual tools and data sources, building in human oversight where needed, and establishing the monitoring and triggers that keep everything running</p><p><strong>Coordination</strong>: Bringing together the people who understand the business need with the builders who can make it work - on the same platform, in real time</p><p>Without both, organisations get stuck in endless development cycles. Engineers build in isolation, business users test and provide feedback, iterations drag on. The agent never reaches production because the people closest to the work can't collaborate effectively with those building the solution.</p><p><strong>The formula we've proven is straightforward: combine AI, code, and humans in the same process, on the same platform</strong>. Technical builders handle architecture whilst domain experts configure and refine. That's coordination, and it only succeeds when the orchestration layer is flexible enough to evolve with your needs.</p><h2 id="our-principles">Our principles</h2><p>We've been building n8n since 2019, first as an automation tool, then as a platform for AI orchestration and cross-team collaboration. Now we're the platform our community and enterprises tell us finally helps them deploy AI in production.&nbsp;</p><p>We've built this alongside a fast-growing community contributing videos, templates, nodes, and more. <strong>A community we'll never stop caring about or restrict access to. Ever.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2025/10/Series-C-Photo-Grid-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1920" srcset="https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/Series-C-Photo-Grid-2.png 600w, https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/Series-C-Photo-Grid-2.png 1000w, https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/10/Series-C-Photo-Grid-2.png 1600w, https://blog.n8n.io/content/images/2025/10/Series-C-Photo-Grid-2.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Flexibility will always be a top product priority. Flexibility to pick any model, connect any tool, and deploy anywhere: our cloud, your server, a Raspberry Pi, or bare metal. Flexibility in the product so it's easy enough to make a quick start but robust enough to handle orchestration's natural complexity.</p><p>From tinkerers automating lights at home to the United Nations running mission-critical workflows at scale, our ambition is clear: <strong>n8n becomes the default platform to build with AI</strong>. And more importantly, to deploy AI.</p><h2 id="what%E2%80%99s-next">What’s next</h2><p>We've made so much progress this year alone: 6x user growth, 10x revenue growth, and major new features like <a href="https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/evaluations/overview/">Evaluations</a>, <a href="https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-tables/">Data Tables</a>, and <a href="https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/">many more</a> improvements. Yet it still feels early.</p><p>The industry is moving fast, and so are we. This funding accelerates our roadmap: expanding our integrations, empowering the ecosystem to build their own nodes and share them globally, and evolving n8n beyond the canvas into new interfaces that match how different teams work. We're making the platform easier to start with whilst more powerful at scale - because that's what production AI demands. (<a href="https://n8n.io/careers/">We're hiring!</a>)</p><p>Our community is already pushing n8n from a platform into an ecosystem. We're rapidly seeing people build their own businesses around n8n, and we want to support the community to take this further: with education, early access to features, commercial partnerships, and fun <a href="https://luma.com/n8n-events">events</a> to bring everyone together.</p><p>I started n8n to remove repetitive tasks and focus on what I actually enjoyed. Now I see a world where building with AI, leveraging agents to scale yourself, and becoming a 10x operator becomes table stakes, just as using Excel is. The first people who knew Excel were special, but now it's a requirement for many roles.</p><p>The same will happen with AI. And my ambition is that n8n becomes the default platform to build with it.</p>

				<p><strong>What you need to know:</strong>&nbsp;Governor Gavin Newsom today signed AB 1264, a first-in-the-nation law phasing out the most concerning ultra-processed foods from California schools.&nbsp;</p>
			</div><div><p>LOS ANGELES – Building on California’s long-standing leadership to protect children’s health and set higher nutrition standards — from his signature on laws <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-09-28/newsom-signs-bill-to-expel-six-food-dyes-from-california-public-schools" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-09-28/newsom-signs-bill-to-expel-six-food-dyes-from-california-public-schools">banning</a> dangerous food dyes and chemicals to implementing <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/06/27/budget/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/06/27/budget/">universal school meals </a>— Governor Gavin Newsom today signed AB 1264 by Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel (D-San Fernando Valley), a bipartisan, first-in-the-nation law providing a statutory definition of ultra-processed foods (UPF). This landmark law will phase out the most concerning ultra-processed foods from school meals in California.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The law is based on a simple, common-sense idea: schools should not serve students products that can harm their health or interfere with their ability to learn.</p></div><div><p>California has never waited for Washington or anyone else to lead on kids’ health — we’ve been out front for years, removing harmful additives and improving school nutrition. This first-in-the-nation law builds on that work to make sure every California student has access to healthy, delicious meals that help them thrive.</p>
<p><small>Governor Gavin Newsom</small></p>
<p>For too many students, the meals they receive at school are the only ones they can count on in a day, which makes the quality of that food all the more important. By removing the most concerning ultra-processed foods, we’re helping children stay nourished, focused, and ready to learn. AB 1264 is the first law of its kind in the nation and builds on California’s long record of leading with children’s health and well-being at the forefront. While Washington debates how to ‘make America healthy again,’ they need not look any further than California.</p>
<p><small>First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom </small></p></div><p><span><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="600" height="338" src="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Governor-Newsom-Signs-Legislation-Phasing-Out-Ultra-Processed-Foods-from-School-Meals-PRESS-RELEASE-GIF.gif" alt="" title=""></span>
			</p><div><p>“With Governor Newsom’s signature on AB 1264, California has taken a historic step toward protecting our children from harmful ultra-processed foods and chemical additives,” <strong>said Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel</strong>. “While Washington DC is paralyzed by inaction, California is once again leading the nation with a bipartisan, commonsense, science-based approach. Here in the Golden State, Democrats and Republicans are joining forces to ensure that students are receiving healthy, nutritious meals that are made from real foods, not harmful chemical additives. I applaud Governor Newsom for his continued leadership on food safety and I am grateful to the dedicated advocates from around the country who worked tirelessly to help us pass this important new law.”</p>
<p>California’s work to promote healthier school food long predates the national “Make America Healthy Again” movement. Since taking office, Governor Newsom and First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom have advanced a series of first-in-the-nation reforms to eliminate toxic additives, strengthen nutrition standards, and expand healthy food access in schools statewide.</p></div><p><span><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1707" src="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/la18-scaled.jpg" alt="" title="" srcset="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/la18-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/la18-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/la18-980x653.jpg 980w, https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/la18-480x320.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 2560px, 100vw"></span>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In November of 2024 I wrote a blog post titled <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/is-python-really-that-slow">"Is Python Really That Slow?"</a>, in which I tested several versions of Python and noted the steady progress the language has been making in terms of performance.</p>
<p>Today is the 8th of October 2025, just a day after the official release of Python 3.14. Let's rerun the benchmarks to find out how fast the new version of Python is!</p>
<p><em>Note: If you do  not care about tables and charts with results and just want to read my conclusions, <a href="#conclusions">click here</a> to go to the end of the article</em>.</p>
<h2>A Quick Word On How Misleading Benchmarks Can Be</h2>
<p>Yes, even though I'm going to share the results of my benchmark, I feel I have to warn you again, like I did in the previous article, that generic benchmarks like this one are not really very useful. Running these benchmarks is fun, and that is why I do it, but it is really impossible to build an accurate performance profile of something as complex as the Python interpreter just from running a couple of silly little scripts.</p>
<p>I have designed my tests so that they run only pure Python code, avoiding the use of any dependencies, and in particular any functions that are written in C code. Native code (aside from the Python interpreter itself, that is) is less likely to become faster from one release of Python to the next, so I see no point in including that in the benchmark. But real-world applications do often use a mix of pure Python and native code, be it C, C++ or Rust, so while my test scripts are great to evaluate the performance of pure Python code, I do not consider them to be representative of the applications we normally use.</p>
<p>In short, have a look at my benchmark, but consider it just one data point and not the last word on Python performance!</p>
<h2>The Testing Matrix</h2>
<p>Here is the test matrix that I've worked with, with five dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 Python versions, plus recent versions of Pypy, Node.js and Rust:<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.python.org/">CPython</a> 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14</li>
<li><a href="https://pypy.org/">Pypy</a> 3.11</li>
<li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node</a> 24</li>
<li><a href="https://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> 1.90</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3 Python interpreters<ul>
<li>Standard</li>
<li>Just-In-Time (JIT): only for CPython 3.13+</li>
<li>Free-threading (FT): only for CPython 3.13+</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2 test scripts<ul>
<li><em>fibo.py</em>: calculates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence">Fibonacci numbers</a>, relying heavily on recursion</li>
<li><em>bubble.py</em>: sorts a list of randomly generated numbers with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">bubble sort</a> algorithm, with a lot of iteration, but no recursion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2 threading modes<ul>
<li>Single-threaded</li>
<li>4 threads running independent calculations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2 computers<ul>
<li>Framework laptop running Ubuntu Linux 24.04 (Intel Core i5 CPU)</li>
<li>Mac laptop running macOS Sequoia (M2 CPU)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may think that including Node.js and Rust in my benchmark is an odd choice. Maybe it is, but just the same, I ported the two Python test applications to JavaScript and Rust, so that I can have some reference numbers from outside of the Python ecosystem, just to put things into perspective.</p>
<h2>The Test Scripts</h2>
<p>Below you can see the main logic in <em>fibo.py</em>:</p>
<pre><code>def fibo(n):
    if n &lt;= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibo(n-1) + fibo(n-2)
</code></pre>
<p>After running some experiments, I've determined that calculating the 40th Fibonacci number with this function took a few seconds on my two laptops, so this is what I used for all the test results I'm sharing below.</p>
<p>Here is the sort function from <em>bubble.py</em>:</p>
<pre><code>def bubble(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] &gt; arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
</code></pre>
<p>For this script I also eyeballed what array size to use so that the script took a few seconds to run. I settled on using a list with 10,000 numbers that are randomly generated.</p>
<p>Please do not assume that these are great examples, because they are not. There are more efficient ways to code these functions if the goal was to make them run as fast as possible. But the goal here is not to have fast functions, but to compare how different Python interpreters run the code. I have chosen these functions mainly because one is recursive and the other is not, so that I have two different coding styles in the test set.</p>
<p>The framework that I built for running this benchmark executes each test function three times and reports the average time of the three runs. The complete test scripts along with the benchmark scripts are available on the <a href="https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/pyspeed">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<h2>Benchmark #1: Fibonacci single-threaded</h2>
<p>Okay, let's have a look at the first test. For this test I measured the time it took to run <code>fibo(40)</code> in seconds. As I mentioned above, for each data point I ran the code three times and averaged the results.</p>
<p>Here are the numbers in table form:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>fibo 1 thread</th>
<th>Linux</th>
<th>macOS</th>
<th>vs. 3.14</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>3.9</td>
<td>15.21</td>
<td>13.81</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The rightmost column shows the speed ratio against 3.14, so a number smaller than 1 in this column means that the corresponding test was slower than 3.14, and a number above means that it was faster. To calculate these ratios I used the average between the Linux and macOS results.</p>
<p>Sometimes it helps to see the data graphically as well, so here is a chart with the above numbers:</p>

<p>What can be learn from these results? We can see that 3.14 has gotten a nice speed improvement over 3.13. It ran close to 27% faster, which is another way of saying that 3.13 ran at about 79% of the speed of 3.14. These results also show that version 3.11 is the point at which Python versions moved from being "very slow" to "not so slow".</p>
<p>One more detail that isn't related to Python 3.14 is that Pypy continues to blow my mind. In this test it was a hair faster that Node.js, and almost 5 times faster than 3.14. Impressive, although still quite far away from Rust, which as expected runs circles around everybody else.</p>
<h3>Just-In-Time and Free-Threading Variants</h3>
<p>Starting with Python 3.13, the CPython interpreter comes in three flavors: standard, free-threading (FT) and just-in-time (JIT). The free-threading interpreter disables the global interpreter lock (GIL), a change that promises to unlock great speed gains in multi-threaded applications. The JIT interpreter includes an on-the-fly compiler to native code, which should, in theory, help portions of code that run multiple times get faster by having them compiled to native code only once.</p>
<p>The results I shared above for 3.13 and 3.14 used the standard interpreter, but I also wanted I to see specifically how the other two interpreter variants dealt with my test.  In the next table and chart you can see a comparison of the same test running on the three interpreters under 3.13 and 3.14:</p>

<p>And this is a bit disappointing. At least for this test, the JIT interpreter did not produce any significant performance gains, so much that I had to double and triple check that I used a correctly built interpreter with this feature enabled. I do not know much about the internals of the new JIT compiler, but I'm wondering if it cannot deal with this heavily recursive function.</p>
<p>As far as free-threading, I already discovered last year that the interpreter was slow when running single-threaded code. In 3.14 this interpreter appears to still be slower than the standard interpreter, but the difference is much smaller, with free-threading running at just 91% of the speed of the standard interpreter.</p>

<p>This test shows a larger discrepancy between my Linux and macOS laptops, but the ratios between versions on each machine are more or less the same. The difference just suggests that Python on the Mac is able to run this test slightly faster.</p>
<p>The 3.14 interpreter is the faster of the CPythons as in the Fibonacci test, but the difference here is smaller than in the previous benchmark, with Python 3.11 clocking in at just 91% of the speed of 3.14. This test also runs slower in 3.12 and 3.13 than in 3.11, an interesting oddity that I also observed in last year's benchmark.</p>
<p>Pypy this time was 18 times faster than 3.14, and even 3 times faster than Node. I really need to spend some time evaluating Pypy, because it looks amazing.</p>
<h3>Just-In-Time and Free-Threading Variants</h3>

<p>The JIT interpreter appears to be a little bit faster here, but only on the Linux version of Python. On the Mac it was a bit faster for 3.13, but slower for 3.14. The speed differences are also very small, so overall I'm feeling the JIT interpreter needs some more time to mature. It seems the code that I'm using is somehow not able to benefit much from JIT compilation.</p>
<p>The free-threading interpreter also ran slower, but again the difference was much smaller in 3.14 than in 3.13, so this is consistent between the two benchmarks. At this point it does not seem like it would make sense to switch to the free-threading interpreter for regular workloads, but it could be an interesting option when the GIL is really getting in the way, which is only for multi-threaded with big CPU needs.</p>
<h2>Benchmark #3: Fibonacci multi-threaded</h2>
<p>This year I decided to introduce multi-threaded versions of the two test programs, mainly as an excuse to give the free-threading interpreter the chance to shine.</p>
<p>What I did for the multi-threaded Fibonacci test is to start four threads running the same calculation of the 40th Fibonacci. The four threads ran independently of each other, and the two laptops that I'm using have more than four cores, so they should be able to parallelize this test nicely. The time measurement that I used is from the time I launched the first thread to the time all four threads ended.</p>
<p>Here are the results of <em>fibo.py</em> running on 4 threads running on the standard interpreters:</p>

<p>Note that I did not run Node and Rust versions of the tests here, since this is a very specific test that only applies to Python's GIL.</p>
<p>Of course these results do not tell us much. We can see again that my Mac seems a bit faster than my Linux machine, but aside from that things have more or less scaled linearly. For example, the single-threaded Fibonacci test ran in 7 seconds, and here it took 25 on the Mac and 32 on Linux, which is, give or take a 4x scale. This is expected because the GIL does not permit the Python code to parallelize.</p>
<p>Let's see the detailed results on the 3.13 and 3.14 interpreters:</p>

<p><img alt="fibo 4 threads - Interpreter variants" src="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/static/images/pyspeed2025-fibo4-latest.png"></p>
<p>And this is quite nice!</p>
<p>Since we were not expecting anything significant for the JIT interpreter on this test, we can ignore those results. But the free-threading interpreter is showing us how removing the GIL can help with running multiple threads that are CPU hungry.</p>
<p>In Python 3.13 the free-threading interpreter ran about 2.2x faster than the standard interpreter. In 3.14 the performance improvement is about 3.1x. This is an exciting result!</p>
<h2>Benchmark #4: Bubble sort multi-threaded</h2>
<p>To complete this benchmarking exercise, below you can see the results of the bubble sort test running on 4 threads. For this test I had each thread sort 10,000 random numbers. The four threads received copies of the same randomly generated array.</p>
<p>First let's look at the standard interpreters:</p>

</table>
<p><img alt="bubble 4 threads" src="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/static/images/pyspeed2025-bubble4-all.png"></p>
<p>These results show no big surprises either. The single-threaded version of this test executed in about 2 seconds on 3.14, and here we have 10 seconds on Linux and 8 seconds on Mac. It's interesting that on the Linux machine this test took a bit longer than 4x the single-threaded time.</p>
<p>Here are the results with the new interpreters in 3.13 and 3.14:</p>

<p><img alt="bubble 4 threads - Interpreter variants" src="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/static/images/pyspeed2025-bubble4-latest.png"></p>
<p>And here once again we see a good use case for the free-threading interpreter. For this test the Mac's free-threading did better than Linux, but on overage 3.14 FT ran about 2x faster than standard 3.14. If you have a multi-threaded application that is CPU heavy, a switch to the free-threading interpreter might be a good idea.</p>
<p>The odd results of the JIT interpreter being slower on the 3.14 Mac interpreter that we've seen in the single-threaded bubble sort test have repeated here, so I guess they were not a fluke, but in any case the differences are not big enough to matter, in my opinion. We'll just have to wait for the JIT interpreter to continue evolving in future releases.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I hope you found my benchmark results interesting. As way of a summary, these are the conclusions that I'm making from these results:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPython 3.14 appears to be the fastest of all the CPythons.</li>
<li>If you can't upgrade to 3.14 just yet, consider using a release since 3.11, as these are significantly faster than 3.10 and older.</li>
<li>The 3.14 JIT interpreter does not appear to provide any significant gains in speed, at least not with my test scripts.</li>
<li>The 3.14 free-threading interpreter is faster than the standard interpreter for CPU heavy multi-threaded applications, so It is worth a try if your application fits this use case. I wouldn't recommend using this interpreter for other workloads, as it is still slower for code that is not directly slowed down by the GIL.</li>
<li>Pypy is insanely fast!</li>
</ul>
<p>Have you benchmarked Python 3.14? Let me know in the comments if you have results that are different than mine.</p></div><p>Thank you for visiting my blog!

		<p><span>Meta open-sourced React over a decade ago to help developers build better user experiences. Since then, React has grown into one of the world’s most popular open source projects,</span><a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/React"> <span>powering over 50 million websites</span></a><span> and products built by</span><a href="https://reactnative.dev/showcase"> <span>companies such as Microsoft, Shopify, Bloomberg, Discord, Coinbase, the NFL, and many others</span></a><span>. With React Native, React has expanded to support platforms beyond the web, including mobile, tablets, desktops, TVs, gaming consoles, and even mixed reality devices.</span></p>
<p><span>This incredible growth is thanks to the thousands of educators, companies, and projects that have contributed to the development of React. The community is the heart of React, and we’re proud to play a part in the cycle of open source innovation throughout the ecosystem that benefits everyone. We’re pleased to give a seat at the table to the people and companies that have made React what it is today.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, we are excited to announce the next step for React. Several projects within the React ecosystem, including React and React Native, as well as supporting projects such as JSX, will transition to the React Foundation. The React Foundation’s mission is to help the React community and its members. The React Foundation will maintain React’s infrastructure, organize</span><a href="https://conf.react.dev/"> <span>React Conf</span></a><span>, and create initiatives to support the React ecosystem. The React Foundation will be part of the Linux Foundation, which has long fostered a vendor-neutral environment for open source projects.</span></p>
<h2>Formalizing Governance</h2>
<p><span>The React Foundation’s governing board will consist of representatives from Amazon, Callstack, Expo, Meta, Microsoft, Software Mansion, and Vercel, with the intention to expand further over time.</span></p>
<p><span>There will be a clear separation between the business and technical governance of React. Releases, features, and technical direction will be governed by a new structure driven by the maintainers and contributors of React. This new technical governance structure will be independent of the React Foundation. The React team is actively working on this new technical governance structure and will share more details in a future post on </span><a href="https://react.dev/blog"><span>the React blog</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h2>Meta and the React Foundation</h2>
<p><span>Meta is committing to a five-year partnership with the React Foundation, including over $3 million in funding and dedicated engineering support. This investment will ensure React’s smooth transition to independent governance while maintaining the stability and innovation the community expects. Meta will continue to invest in React and use it as our primary tool for building UI on the web and across many of Meta’s apps. Meta will also continue to have a dedicated team of engineers working full-time on React and React Native.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe the best of React is yet to come. The React Foundation will unlock new opportunities for collaboration, innovation, and growth that will benefit the entire ecosystem. We’re excited to see what the community will build together under this new model. With strengthened governance, broader industry participation, and continued technical excellence, React is positioned to tackle the next generation of challenges in UI development.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5885">
	

	<div>
			
<p>On June 30, 2025, Mark Brittenham and Susan Hermiller uploaded a preprint to the arXiv called  “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24088">Unknotting number is not additive under connected sum</a>” (and an updated version on September 15, 2025). In it, they surprised the mathematical community by giving a counterexample to a long-standing conjecture in knot theory. The story was picked up by publications like <em><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-knot-theory-discovery-overturns-long-held-mathematical-assumption/">Scientific American</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-simple-way-to-measure-knots-has-come-unraveled-20250922/">Quanta</a></em> and by math YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx7f-nGohVc">Matt Parker</a>.</p>



<p>The conjecture is easy to understand, although we need a few definitions first. </p>



<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory">(Mathematical) knot</a></strong>: We can think of a mathematical knot as a loop of string sitting in three-dimensional space. In other words, if we took a piece of string, tied a knot, and then glued the two ends together, we’d get a mathematical knot.</p>



<p><strong>Knot projection:</strong> Given any mathematical knot, we draw a two-dimensional version of it in the plane. It is like the shadow of the knot, but with breaks in the knot to indicate which strand is on top and which is on the bottom.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknotting_number">Unknotting number</a>:</strong> If we have the projection of a knot, we can change some crossings (change which strand is over and which is under) to make it unknotted (called the unknot). To compute the unknotting number of a knot <em>K</em>, <em>u</em>(<em>K</em>), we look at all possible projections and find the fewest number of crossing changes we must make to obtain the unknot.</p>



<p><strong>Connected sum:</strong> Given two knots, <em>J</em> and <em>K</em>, we can cut each knot at one point and join the cut ends to form a new, larger knot, <em>J</em>#<em>K</em>. This is called the connected sum of the knots.</p>



<p>Below, we see a knot called the (2,7) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus_knot">torus knot</a> and its mirror image (left), and their connected sum on the right.</p>



<figure><a href="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-2-e1759968108504.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5893" data-permalink="https://divisbyzero.com/1-2/" data-orig-file="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-2-e1759968108504.jpg" data-orig-size="917,1017" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-2-e1759968108504.jpg?w=271" data-large-file="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-2-e1759968108504.jpg?w=917" width="917" height="1017" src="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-2-e1759968108504.jpg" alt=""></a></figure>



<p>Although unknotting numbers are notoriously difficult to compute, we know that the unknotting number of a (<em>p,q</em>) torus knot is (p-1)(q-1)/2. So, the (2,7) torus knots above have unknotting number (2&nbsp;–&nbsp;1)(7&nbsp;–&nbsp;1)/2&nbsp;=&nbsp;3. It is not difficult to check that by changing three crossings of the projections shown above, the (2,7) torus knot becomes the unknot. It turns out that changing two crossings does not suffice in this projection or any projection.</p>



<p>Likewise, changing 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;6 crossings of the connected sum will yield the unknot. In fact, it will always be the case that <em>u</em>(<em>J</em>#<em>K</em>)&nbsp;≤<em>&nbsp;u</em>(<em>J</em>)&nbsp;+<em>&nbsp;u</em>(<em>K</em>). The question is: are these equal? An “old” conjecture (which was implicit in an article 88 years ago), states:</p>



<p><strong>Conjecture: </strong>If <em>J</em> and <em>K</em> are knots, then <em>u</em>(<em>J</em>#<em>K</em>)&nbsp;=<em>&nbsp;u</em>(<em>J</em>)&nbsp;+<em>&nbsp;u</em>(<em>K</em>). </p>



<p>In their preprint, Brittenham and Hermiller disprove the conjecture by giving a counterexample! Moreover, the counterexample is precisely the one I’ve shown above! The connected sum of the torus knot with its mirror image has unknotting number 5, which is clearly less than&nbsp;3&nbsp;+&nbsp;3. </p>



<p>That said, we can’t simply change the five crossings in the above projection to obtain the unknot. We must produce a different projection first. But what is it?</p>



<p>I looked for the answer online and found this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14265">arXiv preprint</a> by Chao Wang and Yimu Zhang, which gives the details. They provide the projection and the crossings that must be changed. However, the projection has 56 crossings (far more than the original 14!). They assert, but do not show, that the resulting knot—after the five crossings are changed—is the unknot. They end by writing, “We prefer to leave it to the readers as an interesting game.”</p>



<p>Never good at resisting a good <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd sniping</a>, I decided to take them up on the challenge. I’m embarrassed to admit how long it took me to confirm their work, but I did it. Here is my redrawn version of the knot projection—the connected sum of the (2,7) torus knot and its mirror image. The circled crossings are the five that must be changed.</p>

<p>After having done so, here’s the resulting projection. Wang and Zhang claim that it is the unknot!</p>



<figure><a href="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2-e1759953200341.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5876" data-permalink="https://divisbyzero.com/2/" data-orig-file="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2-e1759953200341.jpg" data-orig-size="827,1017" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="2" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2-e1759953200341.jpg?w=244" data-large-file="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2-e1759953200341.jpg?w=827" width="827" height="1017" src="https://divisbyzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2-e1759953200341.jpg" alt=""></a></figure>



<p>Without further ado, here are my drawings. This first sequence shows how I get from the usual projection of the connected sum to the projection in which the crossings must be made. The red strands show the part of the projection that has changed from the previous projection.</p>

<p>Thus, the final image above is the knot we claim is the unknot. The following sequence of steps shows that it is indeed the unknot.</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of blog posts describing my experience developing a low latency 10G Ethernet core for FPGA. I decided to do this as a personal project to develop expertise in low latency FPGA design and high-speed Ethernet, as well as to experiment with tools and techniques that I could use full-time. As a small spoiler, the design has less than <strong>60ns loopback latency</strong>, which is comparable to commercial offerings.</p>

<p>These posts will focus on the things that are likely different to a ‘standard’ design, as I believe this will be more interesting to the reader. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The use of <a href="https://www.cocotb.org/">cocotb</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pyuvm/pyuvm">pyuvm</a> for verification</li>
  <li>The techniques implemented to reduce packet processing latency</li>
  <li>Analysis of commercially available low latency and ‘ultra’-low latency cores</li>
  <li>Latency measurement results and comparison</li>
  <li>Other techniques not implemented</li>
</ul>

<p>If the reader is unfamiliar with Layer 1/2 Ethernet, I would recommend the following resources:</p>

<p>Let’s say you decide to start a coding bootcamp. Your background is in pedagogy and you love teaching. Your parents were teachers.</p>



<p>You find a co-founder, raise a bit of money, and pour your soul into your company.</p>



<p>The first couple of years, students<em> love</em> your program. Positive feedback, extraordinary student outcomes, employees love the mission. You are quite literally changing lives.</p>



<p>Your business grows. One day, you realize you’ve grown to 70 employees.</p>



<p>And then…</p>



<p>A competitor gets control of the main subreddit for your industry by becoming a Reddit Moderator.</p>



<p>That watering hole becomes their megaphone. They are not shy about using it. An all-out attack on your brand begins. The barrage of accusations and harassment are relentless. The attacks happen daily. You become a neurotic fixation of the moderator. Every little thing you do represents your failings as a company.</p>



<p>You get compared to a sex cult. One of your employees is accused of nepotism. The mod starts joining your company information sessions for prospective students, slinging conspiracy theories at every turn under a pseudonym. You avoid outright bans to avoid appearing biased yourself. Your own employees start wondering if these accusations have merit, some leave.</p>



<p>Even worse, confidential information from your company starts leaking out. There’s a mole. Or at least your team suspects it. No one knows who to trust. Your carefully built company culture? Eviscerated from the inside out.</p>



<p>Any time you attempt to defend yourself in the main subreddit, posts get deleted. Or you’re accused of running a Reddit bot army.</p>



<p>This goes on for years.</p>



<p>Every day, another attack. Every fucking day.</p>



<p>Student applications drop. First a little… then a lot.</p>



<p>Combined with a market downtown, your revenue collapses by 80%.</p>



<p>You go through 2 layoffs just to keep the lights on. A bunch of other folks move on. You’re down to 15 employees now.</p>



<p>The attacks don’t stop. If anything, they escalate.</p>



<p>And you begin to wonder, as the CEO and founder of your company… “Maybe I’m the problem? Maybe I <em>am</em> doing something wrong? Or somehow encouraging these attacks on my company?”</p>



<p>You make a decision to leave.</p>



<p>You step down, walk away from everything you built, and start anew.</p>



<p>But even then, the attacks don’t stop. Nothing can stop this nightmare.</p>



<p>This is the story of Will Sentance and his company, Codesmith.</p>



<p>It can happen to your business too.</p>



<h2>The Codesmith Reputation Attack via Google</h2>



<p>For many businesses, the first page of Google for their brand name is the single most important asset for managing their reputation.</p>



<p>Let’s say I’m considering a bootcamp, I hear about “Codesmith,” and pop it into Google.</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="2034" height="1674" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result.png 2034w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result-300x247.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result-1024x843.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result-768x632.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result-1536x1264.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2034px) 100vw, 2034px"></a></figure>



<p>Fuck me that’s bad. This is the number 2 result right after the company website.</p>



<ul>
<li>“Codesmith is an enormous waste of money”</li>



<li>“Do Not Go To Codesmith”</li>
</ul>



<p>I don’t even have to click, Google is serving that stuff up right under the company’s website. God damn.</p>



<p>That top Reddit thread has been ranking highly for Codesmith brand terms since Sept 2024. That’s a year’s worth of brand carnage.</p>



<p><strong>Pay close attention to the subreddit all those threads are from: r/codingbootcamp. That’s the key to all this.</strong></p>



<h2>Are LLMs Also a Reputation Attack Vector on Codesmith?</h2>



<p>Yup.</p>



<p>My prompt in ChatGPT was “is codesmith a good bootcamp?”.</p>



<p>The intro has a bunch of standard stuff, and then there was this:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="608" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts-1024x608.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts-1024x608.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts-300x178.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts-768x456.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts-1536x911.png 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts.png 1692w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Same Reddit threads are featured, same brand-destroying quotes.</p>



<p>By the way, <a href="https://www.cirr.org/">CIRR</a> is a nonprofit in the bootcamp industry that collects graduation data across the industry. It’s a neutral third-party with the goal of providing transparency on student outcomes across coding bootcamps. If your graduation rates are solid, wouldn’t it make sense for a competitor to call that data into question? ChatGPT is regurgitating those same doubts here.</p>



<p>At this point, I’ve done a quick brand search and asked ChatGPT if Codesmith is any good. I already have a TON of doubts as a prospect.</p>



<p>I don’t believe this is an accident. Or a result of Codesmith’s actual quality as a bootcamp.</p>



<p>I believe this brand attack is the result of one person’s actions.</p>



<p>When I’ve researched Codesmith’s brand, every Reddit thread I’ve seen in Google and various LLMs have all been from a single subreddit: r/codingbootcamp. That subreddit is controlled by the Reddit Moderator Michael Novati.</p>



<h2>Who is Michael Novati?</h2>



<p>For the best recap of Michael, listen to <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-coding-machine-at-meta">this interview from Pragmatic Engineer Gergely Orosz</a>.</p>



<p>The highlights:</p>



<ul>
<li>Michael joined Facebook early in 2009.</li>



<li>As he tells it, went through a bunch of promotions quickly and made it to Principal Software Engineer (E7).</li>



<li>Left Facebook in 2017.</li>



<li>In 2019, co-founded his dev bootcamp, Formation, with his wife, Sophie Novati. His wife is the CEO, Michael took the CTO title.</li>
</ul>



<p>In that interview, Michael tells a story about playing Risk (the board game) with Mark Zuckerberg.</p>



<p>“<em>The way we became friends, he [Zuckerberg] used to play Risk, the board game. I think it was once a week that people would get together. Like 4 or 5 people. He would show up often and I really liked Risk. I would always play Risk as a kid for whatever reason, I don’t even know why.</em></p>



<p><em>And one day, we’re down to the final three people. And it was me, him, and I was losing. Mark was in second place, the leader was taking over.</em></p>



<p><em>I did a really.. uhhh.. let’s say delicate, strategic maneuver. Where I made an alliance with him to share resources and go after the first place person. So he went all in on the first place person.</em></p>



<p><em>My turn’s next. I did not go all in against the first place person, I took over Mark’s remaining resources. He just dwindled going after the first place person. He accepted my friendship request [on Facebook] very shortly that evening.</em></p>



<p><em>It’s weird, I basically backstabbed him in the game, really bad. Blatantly to his face. But it’s the game, that’s what Risk is. It’s a strategy game. I think he appreciated the strategy I had. It made him feel more like he could trust me. Even though I backstabbed him, he knows where my strategic thinking is coming from.</em>“</p>



<p>Now, is this just a funny anecdote about an early Facebook backstabbing Mark Zuckerberg and then becoming friends? Maybe.</p>



<p>For me, it tells me a lot about how Michael Novati plays competitive games. In my experience, people tend to run businesses the same way they compete at anything. Maybe Michael is the exception.</p>



<p>I do have to admit, it takes some real cojones to fuck over your boss that hard in a board game. Especially when that boss is Zuckerberg.</p>



<p>One last note: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/software-engineer-training-platform-formation-raises-4m-in-round-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/">Formation raised a $4M seed round in 2021, led by Andreessen Horowitz.</a></p>



<h2>Michael Novati’s Control Over the Coding Bootcamp Industry</h2>



<p>Michael Novati’s power over the coding bootcamp industry comes from one place: being a moderator on the subreddit r/codingbootcamp.</p>



<p>He is, by far, the most active moderator for the subreddit. You’ll bump into him immediately just by visiting the subreddit:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="586" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-1024x586.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-1024x586.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-300x172.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-768x440.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-1536x879.png 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-2048x1172.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>What about the other mods?</p>



<ul>
<li>u/samabuna hasn’t posted in about 8 years.</li>



<li>u/dowcet/ is still active on Reddit but rarely posts in r/codingbootcamp. When I checked, I only found one comment in the preceeding 1-2 months.</li>
</ul>



<p>So the subreddit is Michael Novati’s show. Full stop.</p>



<p>We have to remember that Reddit isn’t just Reddit anymore. The powers that be have decided that Reddit is infallible, a reliable set of training data for LLMs, and should be featured fucking everywhere.</p>



<p>Before we get to what Michael has actually done, let’s lay out the potential power for anyone that gets control of a key subreddit in their industry:</p>



<ul>
<li>If the subreddit is greenlit by Google, threads in your subreddit can easily pop to the top of Google searches that are extremely valuable to your business. Brand terms, review terms, product categories, major how-to topics, all of it.</li>



<li>LLMs prioritize Reddit heavily. If you want to spin conspiracy theories, those conspiracies will start to become part of the zeitgeist as every LLM regurgitates them.</li>



<li>Skew the narrative for long enough and it’ll be impossible for ANY prospect to not stumble across your skewed narrative when they’re researching products or services.&nbsp;</li>



<li>You can delete posts and comments at will. Want to tip the narrative in your favor? Just delete some of the positive posts of your competitors. To cover your tracks, make up claims about a bot army that’s run by your competitor. You’re fighting the good fight and keeping the barbarians at bay! You don’t even need to actively post negative stuff (but you can if you want to dial up the torture). Just removing positive stuff skews the narrative nicely.</li>



<li>You can ban users at will. Got some troublesome competitors fighting back? Just delete the little shits.</li>



<li>You can pin posts in the subreddit and comments within posts. Great tactic for pushing a narrative when you really need to.</li>
</ul>



<p>What about recourse from your competitors? Can they do anything to stop you?</p>



<p>You can only lose your moderator slot in a few instances:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Reddit Admis get involved, actual Reddit employees. Stuff has to get pretty egregious for that.</li>



<li>Moderators further up the mod list can kick you out. But if you get on good terms with them, or they don’t care, you have free reign.</li>



<li>If there are other mods below you AND you go inactive, you can get kicked by them too. So don’t let any new mods in. And always stay active. Simple.</li>
</ul>



<p>No one else across the industry can do a damn thing. You get to act with impunity.</p>



<p>To be clear, any moderator of an industry subreddit has this power. That’s not a subjective opinion, it’s a fact. That’s how our online platforms currently work.</p>



<p>Michael Novati has this power over the bootcamp industry. Did he wield it benevolently? If he did, I wouldn’t be writing this fucking post.</p>



<h2>How Michael Distorts Narratives on Reddit</h2>



<p>At first, I was going to go through a bunch of Michael Novati’s claims and debunk them.</p>



<p>Then I realized I was missing the entire point.</p>



<p>This isn’t a normal debate where there are two sides of the truth and we need to sort through it to get to the real answer.</p>



<p>It’s about one side torching the truth with a firehose of chaos and distortion.</p>



<p>Prospects in the bootcamp space are evaluating whether or not to spend tens of thousands of dollars on a bootcamp. It’s the price of a goddamn car. It doesn’t take much to get someone to pause and redirect their purchase journey.</p>



<p>So let’s go through a few of the worst examples.</p>



<h3>Compare Your Competitor to a Sex Cult (Loosely for Deniability)</h3>



<p>Here’s a fucked up one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Reddit user, with a first-time post, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/12r57se/as_a_former_codesmith_employee_codesmith_is_an/">posts a major takedown of Codesmith</a>, claiming to be a former employee. Tons of allegations about mismanagement, poor curriculum, and backroom dealing with CIRR. I personally think these allegations are bullshit but that’s not the most fucked up part in this thread.</p>



<p>u/rosiebeir joins the conversation and gives a measured take on their experience as a student in Codesmith:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="317" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review-1024x317.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review-1024x317.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review-300x93.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review-768x238.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review.png 1428w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Most of the comment is about different aspects of the Codesmith program that could be improved. It all feels genuine to me. Further down, they say this:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="206" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary-1024x206.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary-1024x206.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary-300x60.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary-768x155.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary.png 1320w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Wow, that’s a helluva endorsement.</p>



<p>This is where Michael jumps in:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="932" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison-1024x932.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison-1024x932.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison-300x273.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison-768x699.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison.png 1312w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>If you’re not familiar with NXIVM (Michael got the spelling wrong), go watch The Vow on HBO. Short story: NXIVM was a sex cult disguised as a self-improvement group and the founder went to prison.</p>



<p>Did Michael just compare Codemith to a goddamn sex cult? Yes he did folks.</p>



<p>Let’s put aside the subject matter for a second. Michael’s use of rhetoric is a master class on how to destroy someone’s reputation without technically saying the horrible thing you’re actually saying.</p>



<p>Michael takes an incredible testimonial from a student (“Codesmith changed my life”), and associates that comment with the sort of things he hears from sex cults. He doesn’t technically call Codesmith a sex cult, he merely makes the association. He also wraps it with other positive comments to look more measured: “something I hear very often” and “I love that Codesmith changed your life.” But these aren’t good things, they’re red flags! Sex cults do the same thing! Someone could get taken advantage of!</p>



<p>Oh so innocent aren’t we Michael?</p>



<p>Now any time a bootcamp prospect wanders into this thread:</p>



<ul>
<li>They see the genuine, positive review from a former student.</li>



<li>A supposed figure of authority (a Reddit moderator), plants a seed questioning that testimonial.</li>



<li>The same mod connects Codesmith to a sex cult in a way that also offers complete deniability.</li>



<li>To top it all off, most folks won’t realize that the Reddit mod is a cofounder of a competing company.</li>
</ul>



<p>Bravo Michael, brav-fucking-o.</p>



<h3>From Reddit Troll to LinkedIn Stalker: The Unhinged Escalation</h3>



<p>This one might piss me off the most.</p>



<p>Michael doesn’t just go after employees, he goes after their <em>kids</em>.</p>



<p>This is a Reddit post about a defunct Codesmith program:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="357" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post-1024x357.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post-1024x357.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post-300x104.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post-768x267.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post-1536x535.png 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post.png 1608w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Somehow, as these threads often do, the conversation turns into an all-out attack on Codesmith. This time, Michael goes after Eric Kirsten, a Senior Advisor at Codesmith. Eric spends a good chunk of his time mentoring Codesmith students and helping prepare them for the job hunt.</p>



<p>Here’s Michael’s post:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Nepotism-Post.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Nepotism-Post-1024x768.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Nepotism-Post-1024x768.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Nepotism-Post-300x225.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Nepotism-Post-768x576.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Nepotism-Post.png 1408w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I do not know what the original comment in this thread was (very convenient). But I do have the original comment from Michael before he edited it:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Nepotism-Pre-Edit.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="583" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Nepotism-Pre-Edit.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Nepotism-Pre-Edit.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Nepotism-Pre-Edit-300x171.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Nepotism-Pre-Edit-768x437.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I talked with Eric myself, here’s the real story:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eric’s wife did a one-time contract project with Codesmith for 9 months.</li>



<li>His son joined as a Codesmith student and had a great outcome. They paid the full program cost and his son went through the normal application process just like everyone else.</li>
</ul>



<p>But it doesn’t stop there.</p>



<p>Michael also decided to email multiple executives at Codesmith about Eric’s son:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="394" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg-1024x394.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg-1024x394.jpeg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg-300x116.jpeg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg-768x296.jpeg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg-1536x591.jpeg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg.jpeg 1714w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I’ve redacted the son’s name and details because WHY THE FUCK WOULD WE BRING SOMEONE’S KID INTO THIS?</p>



<p>I don’t think I could possibly swear enough in order to convey how utterly insane all this is.</p>



<p>Just imagine this happening at your own company:</p>



<ul>
<li>A cofounder of your competitor, starts attacking one of your employees on Reddit.</li>



<li>Then that cofounder starts LOOKING UP THEIR KIDS ON LINKEDIN</li>



<li>They post weird mentions on Reddit about that kid, accusing your company of nepotism.</li>



<li>THEN EMAILS you and other executives, accusing the kid of falsifying their LinkedIn, threatening to keep calling it out in public.</li>
</ul>



<p>WHAT.</p>



<p>WHAT. THE. FUCK.</p>



<p>What would you do in this situation?</p>



<p>I’m not sure what I would do. But there is no world where this is normal or okay.</p>



<h3>The Great OSP Conspiracy for Manufactured Outrage</h3>



<p>Another favorite tactic of Michael is to take something obscure, and allude to some grand conspiracy behind it.</p>



<p>Like OSPs.</p>



<p>OSP stands for open-source product. It’s a built-in part of the Codesmith program, the capstone project. Here’s how Codesmith explains it:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="389" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product-1024x389.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product-1024x389.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product-300x114.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product-768x292.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product.png 1378w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>This seems incredibly boring, how the hell could someone possibly turn this into a controversy?</p>



<p>If you’re asking that question, you’ve severely underestimated Michael.</p>



<p>A since-deleted Reddit account posted this thread (convenient that it’s a deleted user huh?):</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Grads-OSP-Complaint.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="409" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Grads-OSP-Complaint-1024x409.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Grads-OSP-Complaint-1024x409.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Grads-OSP-Complaint-300x120.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Grads-OSP-Complaint-768x307.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Grads-OSP-Complaint-1536x614.png 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Grads-OSP-Complaint.png 1642w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>They claim Codesmith students are using OSPs to inflate their resumes to get jobs faster. And that this is endemic at Codesmith.</p>



<p>The comments are a dumpster fire. Michael has posted 11 of the comments, almost a third of the entire conversation.</p>



<p>A former Codesmith student jumps in:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="261" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs-1024x261.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs-1024x261.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs-300x76.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs-768x196.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs.png 1524w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>There’s some back an forth between u/peppimenti and other Reddit users, then Michael responds:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="782" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs-1024x782.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs-1024x782.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs-300x229.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs-768x586.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs.png 1326w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Fuck me, that’s a lot to take in.</p>



<p>Quick tangent: this is another one of Michael’s tactics. Make accusations faster than anyone can possibly fact check them or even process them. I still haven’t figured out what that Phil Troutman reference is.</p>



<p>To summarize, Michael claims he has evidence that Codesmith is aware of the lying on resumes, alludes to a conspiracy with OSLabs, and he believes Codesmith helped verify some of this lying.</p>



<p>Then he associates all of this with “conspiring to commit fraud” and that it’s a “jail-able crime.”</p>



<p>We’ve gone from “Codesmith students complete an OSP during their program” to a shadowy conspiracy and fraud via student resumes. God damn did that escalate.</p>



<p>So I got a hold of the exact SOP that is given by Codesmith to students on how to write their resume. Here’s the section on OSPs:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="538" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes-1024x538.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes-1024x538.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes-300x158.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes-768x404.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes.png 1206w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Codesmith is telling students explicitly not to misrepresent their experience with OSPs as a role at a company. They advocate for transparency, as they should. What students do with that is up to them. And even if some students stretch the truth, no hiring manager is getting fooled by that. End of story.</p>



<p>What about the OSLabs stuff?</p>



<p>When I chatted with Alina (the current CEO of Codesmith), here’s what she had to say on how Codesmith students interact with <a href="https://www.opensourcelabs.io/">OSLabs</a>:</p>



<p>“<em>They [students] get a chance to work on it [projects]. Once those are ready, they submit to OSLabs who keeps the repository and manages the repository. There’s no kind of financial exchange or anything like that. They just hold the repository of the open source dev tools.</em>“</p>



<p>OSLabs is just a nonprofit that manages student repos. That’s it.</p>



<p>Maybe you think there are problems with Codesmith’s guidance. Real quick, why don’t we check some of Michael’s own students from his bootcamp company, Formation?</p>



<p>There’s tons of students on his site. Some of them get featured heavily, like here:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="702" height="1024" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature-702x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature-702x1024.png 702w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature-206x300.png 206w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature-768x1120.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature-1053x1536.png 1053w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature.png 1316w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"></a></figure>



<p>Here’s Carlitos’ LinkedIn:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="807" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn-1024x807.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn-1024x807.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn-300x236.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn-768x605.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn-1536x1211.png 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn.png 1644w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Carlitos is listing his time at Michael’s bootcamp/training company in his experience section. The exact same thing that Michael RAILS on Codesmith for.</p>



<p>To be clear: I don’t think there’s anything wrong with this. Carlitos, all the Codesmith students, or ANY student from ANY bootcamp have done nothing wrong by putting stuff like this on their resumes. If Formation students list their time like this, I don’t see anything wrong with that either.</p>



<p>In the thousands of resumes I’ve reviewed, I’ve never had any trouble differentiating between full-time roles, part-time, freelance, training, or any other random item on a resume. Any hiring manager will sniff this stuff from a mile away. No one is fooling anyone.</p>



<p>But Michael has now turned this into a story of fraud facilitated by Codesmith. And here I am writing hundreds of words about this nonsense. There’s nothing here beyond what Michael has conjured into the ether of Reddit.</p>



<p>You might disagree with some of the guidance that Codesmith gives its graduates but no one is doing anything wrong. It sure as fuck aint fraud.</p>



<p>And that’s what Michael is so damn good at, turning innocuous little things into grand conspiracies that take hours of research to untangle.</p>



<h2>Michael Novati’s Nonstop Attack Campaign Against Codesmith</h2>



<p>Think I’m cherry picking examples of Michael’s posts?</p>



<p>Let’s zoom out.</p>



<p>My team and I looked at every Reddit post and comment made by Michael Novati over the past 3 months.</p>



<p>We then catalogued the posts that mentioned Codesmith or were referencing Codesmith based on context. Next we categorized those posts based on if the sentiment was positive, neutral, or negative towards Codesmith.</p>



<p>Here’s all the days that had negative comments along with their frequency over the past few months:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="939" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months-1024x939.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months-1024x939.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months-300x275.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months-768x704.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Fucking relentless.</p>



<p>It’s easier to highlight days where Michael DOESN’T talk about Codesmith. Dude, get a fucking hobby.</p>



<p>What if the past few months don’t adequately reflect Michael’s posting history? What if recent events have just been a negative phase of the bootcamp space? Can we really make any claims using just the last few months?</p>



<p>Fine, let’s go further.</p>



<p>I went to my team and said “fuck it, let’s go back as far as possible.” So we went through all of Michael’s posts since June 2024. That’s when Reddit stops making it easy to pull up comments. Yes, we looked at every post and comment from over a year. No fast and dirty AI analysis here, we did it by hand.</p>



<p>Here’s the timeline of negative posts and comments since June 2024:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="878" height="1024" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual-878x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual-878x1024.png 878w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual-257x300.png 257w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual-768x896.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px"></a></figure>



<p>What. The. Fuck.</p>



<p>Who has the time for this?</p>



<p>In order to adequately show how often Michael posts negative comments about Codesmith, we had to use HABIT TRACKER VISUALIZATIONS.</p>



<p>It’s relentless, it’s nonstop, and in my opinion, completely unhinged. At least Michael slows down a tad during the holidays. Otherwise, he’s all gas, no breaks.</p>



<p>Well, alright, MAYBE Michael was posting in such absurd volume that the positive mentions outweigh the negative? Maybe I’m selectively pulling data?</p>



<p>NOPE.</p>



<p>The comments about Codesmith are severely overweighted on the negative side. In aggregate, here’s how the sentiment breaks down:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment-1024x683.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment-1024x683.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment-300x200.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment-768x512.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Is it just me or is there a weeeee bit of bias in this posting?</p>



<p>Yes, yes, there fucking is.</p>



<p>Alright, fine, MAYBE all this negative attention is deserved. Maybe Codesmith is the villain that Michael claims. Let’s find out.</p>



<h2>Other Bootcamp Competitors Hold Codesmith in High Regard</h2>



<p>I interviewed 10 different folks. Including students, multiple Codesmith employees from the leadership team, and founders of competing coding bootcamps. I dug through countless docs, many of them internal, and probably annoyed some of these folks with my endless requests for screenshots to verify stories.</p>



<p>Overall, I found everyone at Codesmith to be:</p>



<ul>
<li>Extremely responsive and on top of their shit. They made promises and kept them.</li>



<li>Transparent to an absurd degree.</li>



<li>Humble, honest, and self-aware.</li>



<li>A desire to do the right thing even at their detriment. These folks don’t know how to play offense, they assume good intent from everyone.</li>
</ul>



<p>In short, these are good folks. Faultless? Of course not, everyone makes mistakes.</p>



<p>But I do believe that the world is better with Codesmith in it.</p>



<p>Which makes this whole situation all the more tragic.</p>



<p>Michael isn’t waging some war against another competitor hellbent on profit-seeking. These are folks that are helping people transition their careers. They are quite literally helping people change their lives. And they’re doing it for the right reasons in my opinion.</p>



<p>Don’t take my word for it.</p>



<p>I spoke with Anthony Hughes, a co-founder of <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/">Tech Elevator</a>, another bootcamp. Here’s what he had to say about Codesmith: “The folks at Codesmith were competitors of Tech Elevator. Especially as everyone went online, we competed directly. I never minded losing to Codesmith. Either choice by students was a good one, both our programs vetted students heavily and would get students great outcomes. If we ever lost to Codesmith, we could accept that because we knew the student would get the outcome they wanted. Not like the lower-quality major programs.”</p>



<p>I also heard the same from Kush Patel, a co-founder and former CEO of <a href="https://www.appacademy.io/">AppAcademy</a> “Codesmith is one of the best players in the space. They run their programs in a way that we benchmarked against. There are plenty of other schools that are questionable and are not getting any scrutiny from Michael.”</p>



<p>We have two co-founders of competing bootcamps saying that Codesmith is <em>one of the good ones</em>. Are there shady bootcamps out there? Absolutely. But Codesmith isn’t one of them.</p>



<h2>The Tactics Michael Uses to Wage His PR Nightmare Campaign</h2>



<p>After reading hundreds of Michael’s posts, a few patterns emerge on how he attacks Codesmith.</p>



<p>To be honest, it’s a masterclass on how to gut your opponent via PR. If every move is intentional by Michael, I gotta hand it to him becasue he’s exceptionally good at this.</p>



<p>Here are the most prominent tactics I saw:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Relentless volume.</strong> It’s not enough to post a few days. If you want to destroy someone’s reputation, you gotta hammer the shit outta that drum. Over a 487 day period, we counted 425 negative posts on Codesmith. That’s an average of 0.87 negative posts per day. A negative post almost every fucking day.</li>



<li><strong>Reference multiple conspiracies at the same time.</strong> If you only mention one conspiracy, folks have a straightforward path to getting to the truth. But if you mention 3-4 at the same time? Only the true masochistics like myself will even attempt to pull it apart.</li>



<li><strong>Rarely, if ever, state your full accusation.</strong> For any single conspiracy, always allude to it. Don’t make a full, comprehensive case that allows someone to see the full picture. Let your audience sit with the uncertainty. You don’t need to win the argument, you only need to sow doubt and fear.</li>



<li><strong>Cherry-pick data.</strong> As the saying goes: “there are lies, damned lies, and statistics.” For any industry data you can get your hands on, find the slice that skews the narrative in your favor. Don’t worry about anyone fact-checking, they never do.</li>



<li><strong>Attack every misstep, no matter how obscure.</strong> Sooner or later, your victim will make mistakes. When they do, attack. No matter how small or obscure, blow it up into a major drama. Hype, distort, and magnify.</li>



<li><strong>Take down third-party arbitrators.</strong> If your industry has some sort of credential, certification, or regulator, attack that body just as much as your competitor. If your competitor has optimized for this transparency, you’ll turn their strength into a weakness. Even better, accuse both parties of conspiring together.</li>



<li><strong>Blame the victim.</strong> Whenever someone mentions that you’re going too hard, say that your competitor is forcing your hand. “You’d love to move on! You don’t want to spend your time on all this! If ONLY your competitor would do the right thing, then all this would stop!” But we all know it’ll never stop.</li>



<li><strong>Delete comments and posts.</strong> Delete comments and posts to skew the narrative in your favor. You don’t need to delete everything, just enough to make the conversation messy and difficult to follow. And a few key deletions tilts the scales in your favor.</li>



<li><strong>Make your claims squishy.</strong> Don’t ever say your competitor is a cult or committing fraud. Say that things look like it, or remind you of it. You’ll have deniability while the association still gets planted in the minds of your audience.</li>
</ul>



<p>A sign of the times.</p>



<h2>The Impact on Codesmith</h2>



<p>Has all this had a material impact on Codesmith?</p>



<p>I spoke to both Will Sentence (former CEO and co-founder) and Alina Vasile (the current CEO). When I asked them how much revenue has declined at Codesmith since their peak, they both told me about 80%.</p>



<p>Then I asked how much of that was due to everything on Reddit. They said about half of the decline, so a 40% drop came from the negative PR on Reddit. And the other 40% is from a slowdown in the bootcamp market.</p>



<p>Will told me that Codesmith reached a high of $23.5M in revenue. A 40% hit from Reddit means a revenue drop of $9.4M.</p>



<p>What about the emotional toll?</p>



<p>I asked Will Sentance how it all impacted him “It made me doubt how I can start anything after. Michael Novati is still going at it by commenting on my fellowship at Oxford. And Reddit is so visible in Google – at a meeting last week in the UK, the person used ChatGPT to look up Codesmith and it referenced all those Reddit posts. I have genuine caution about launching new stuff.”</p>



<p>Even after leaving Codesmith, the Reddit harassment still impacts Will.</p>



<p>Students also feel deeply uncomfortable with Michael’s actions.</p>



<p>I spoke with a former employee from Codesmith who told me “I was a teacher at Codesmith and the primary reason for moving away from teaching was MIchael Novati. I signed up to help a team of great people help people achieve their goals like I did, I didn’t sign up to be targeted and attacked by a Reddit troll. It took a toll on my mental health and I decided to step back to focus on my day job at Microsoft.”</p>



<p>Here’s another instance of a student calling Michael out on LinkedIn:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LinkedIn-Codesmith-Student-and-Michael-Connection-Requests-Redacted.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="752" height="1024" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LinkedIn-Codesmith-Student-and-Michael-Connection-Requests-Redacted-752x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LinkedIn-Codesmith-Student-and-Michael-Connection-Requests-Redacted-752x1024.png 752w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LinkedIn-Codesmith-Student-and-Michael-Connection-Requests-Redacted-220x300.png 220w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LinkedIn-Codesmith-Student-and-Michael-Connection-Requests-Redacted-768x1046.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LinkedIn-Codesmith-Student-and-Michael-Connection-Requests-Redacted.png 1088w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px"></a></figure>



<p>And another student that reached out to Will Sentence:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FCNY-Student-Doubts-from-Michael-Redacted-1-scaled.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="604" height="2560" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FCNY-Student-Doubts-from-Michael-Redacted-1-scaled.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FCNY-Student-Doubts-from-Michael-Redacted-1-scaled.png 604w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FCNY-Student-Doubts-from-Michael-Redacted-1-71x300.png 71w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FCNY-Student-Doubts-from-Michael-Redacted-1-483x2048.png 483w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px"></a></figure>



<p>My sources also told me:</p>



<ul>
<li>An executive was threatened after moving to another company, accusations were going to be raised over IP conflicts. These accusations appear meritless and ridiculous to me.</li>



<li>The morale at Codesmith has sharply declined.</li>



<li>Some employees have had mental health difficulties, some left Codesmith.</li>



<li>One contractor ended their working relationship with Codesmith because of a fear of being dragged into all this.</li>



<li>An employee was doxxed after posting in the /r/codingbootcamp subreddit.</li>



<li>Prospective students have pulled applications.</li>



<li>Students that had amazing outcomes are afraid to post about their experiences.</li>



<li>After graduating, some students began questioning their own experience and considered going back to their old careers.</li>
</ul>



<p>As much as I wanted to detail these stories, I had a lot of requests from sources to remain anonymous. Even when folks went through some heinous shit from all this, they specifically requested not to be included.</p>



<p>It is difficult to understate the impact that Michael’s actions have had on Codesmith.</p>



<h2>Is Michael Novati Breaking the Moderator Code of Conduct on Reddit?</h2>



<p>I think so. But it’s not my call.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct">Reddit Moderator Code of Conduct</a> says this:</p>

<p>So what counts as compensation?</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="784" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation-1024x784.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation-1024x784.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation-300x230.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation-768x588.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation.png 1364w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Basically, Reddit Moderators can’t receive compensation for doing basic moderator tasks. Good rule, the point is to prevent companies and third-parties from paying Reddit mods off.</p>



<p>Now here’s the tricky part.</p>



<p>What if that Reddit Moderator is a co-founder of a competitor? What if they spend YEARS shit talking you and destroying your reputation? What if they’re not technically receiving new stock but the value in their startup equity goes up after they destroy you on Reddit? Doesn’t that count as financial compensation and a violation of Reddit’s own rule to “Moderate with Integrity”?</p>



<p>I believe it does.</p>



<p>And I believe that’s why Michael is doing what he’s doing. He wins when Codesmith loses.</p>



<p>Shit like this is why Reddit has become extremely untrustworthy.</p>



<h2>What Drives the Crazy Student Outcomes at Codesmith</h2>



<p>If you dig around, you will find stories from Codesmith students and placement data that seem <em>too</em> good to be true. Is Codesmith actually that good?</p>



<p>As far as I can tell, it’s all real.</p>



<p>So how has Codesmith managed it? I found two forces that have driven these outcomes.</p>



<h3>1. Codesmith Has an Intense Application Process</h3>



<p>Not just anyone can join Codesmith. They screen folks OUT of their program. If you’re a line cook, kinda think a software engineer job sounds fun, have never spent even 5 minutes figuring out what that looks like, and apply, you won’t get in.</p>



<p>Codesmith only accepts folks that they think have a good chance of succeeding.</p>



<p>They filter the front of their student pipeline which keeps the outcome rates really high on the backend. That’s how they get their placement numbers as high as they are. That’s the “trick” to juicing the student outcomes.</p>



<p>Now, if you have some software engineering experience, you’ll likely find the application to be absurdly easy. That’s the point.</p>



<p>To me, Codesmith isn’t a true zero to one program. The students that thrive have already put a lot of self-study hours into their career transition. They’re motivated, have learned the basics, and are ready to dial up the intensity. These are folks that are also likely to succeed during the job application process after they graduate.</p>



<p>This is also one of the easiest ways to spot the shitty bootcamps. If they take anyone and everyone, that’s an enormous red flag. Stay away.</p>



<h3>2. The Hiring Market Was Extremely Strong from 2019-2022</h3>



<p>I spoke to one student that went through Codesmith in 2020, they reported that every single one of the folks in their cohort landed a software engineering job within about 6 months. That’s nuts.</p>



<p>Another graduate from the 2019 era told me that 80-90% of the students from their cohort, the cohort before, and the cohort after, landed software engineering jobs within a few months of graduating.</p>



<p>How were the placements that high? I believe the Codesmith program had something to do with it. But that was also a period where the tech market was exceptionally hot. Across all levels and functions, it was much easier to switch jobs, get promotions, and change careers in tech. I saw that myself.</p>



<p>I’ve also personally seen things tighten a lot in the past few years.</p>



<p>How do Codesmiths placement rates look now?</p>



<p>Even if we look at more recent cohorts, the placements are still pretty damn strong for the full-time program:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="998" height="1024" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes-998x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes-998x1024.png 998w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes-292x300.png 292w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes-768x788.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes.png 1384w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 998px) 100vw, 998px"></a></figure>



<p>That’s <a href="https://www.cirr.org/schooldata">one of the reports issued by CIRR on Codesmith</a>. It’s the full report so I’m not cherry picking.</p>



<p>Even during 2023-2024, a pretty shitty period to try to start a career as a software engineer, 70% of folks are still landing in-field jobs within a year of graduating Codesmith. With a median salary of $110,000. Even if you only count full-time employment, it’s still 62%.  I personally think that’s remarkable.</p>



<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19z0FzVPHJ5qJLZ2T4Q_1EHaKo64TJpxm/view">The part-time program is only slightly worse at 60%</a>.</p>



<p>Again, this is during a hiring market when entry-level software engineering jobs are brutally hard to get. And the placement rates are still in the 60-70% range.</p>



<p>I’m also hearing that students have to work a lot harder now to land that job. And it can take a solid year. That’s that state of tech hiring at the moment.</p>



<p>So if you see old placement data of 80-100%, that was when the market was hot. Now it’s come back down to earth which is to be expected.</p>



<h2>The Future of Codesmith</h2>



<p>To me the future of Codesmith looks quite bright. Alina (the CEO) is very much in control, the team is excited about the future, and the student outcomes still look impressive to me. I’ve been told that there are no plans at Codesmith to shut down.</p>



<p>Especially with all the changes to software development from AI, there’s a lot of training that everyone is going to have to go through in tech. Good time to be in the education space.</p>



<p>If Michael could take his boot off Codesmith’s throat for just half a minute, they’d do a lot of good for a lot people.</p>



<h2>My Recommendations for Anyone Considering Joining a Developer Bootcamp</h2>



<p>I cannot tell you which bootcamp to attend. Or whether a bootcamp is worth it at all.</p>



<p>I’ve hired well over a hundred folks in my career, interviewed countless others. Including engineers and data scientists.</p>



<p>At no point did I ever place any value in a bootcamp. I also never considered it a detractor. It’s neutral to me, never really signaling anything. Neither good nor bad.</p>



<p>If you think it’ll get you your first job (which is all that really matters), and the price/time makes sense for you, go for it. But there are plenty of other paths. It’s not required by any means. I know plenty of self-taught devs that have worked at prestigious startups and big tech.</p>



<p>As for which bootcamp, that’s also up to you.</p>



<p>What I can say is this.</p>



<p>As I’ve gone through Michael Novati’s Reddit account, I’ve been appalled. I’ve never seen anything like this in my entire career. And I’ve played in some fucked up corners of the internet. That last thing I’d EVER want is to have my name or career associated with anything that Michael Novati has touched. That includes his startup, Formation.</p>



<p>You’ll have to make your own choice. But I know what mine would be.</p>



<p>At the very least, when doing research on bootcamps, I would consider anything on r/codingbootcamp/ to be completely contaminated. Whatever the real truth is, that subreddit is Michael’s personal fiefdom. He can do and say whatever he wants. And he has one helluva conflict of interest: he’s a co-founder and CTO of a leading bootcamp (even if he tries to claim that he doesn’t run a bootcamp).</p>



<p>If I was looking for unbiased reviews, I’d only factor in content from a community that Michael (or any other bootcamp founder) did not control. Make sure you know who your subreddit Mods are.</p>



<h2>Every Company is Now Vulnerable to These Types of Reputation Attacks</h2>



<p>For me, the craziest part of this story is that it’s not an edge case.</p>



<p>Anyone can use this exact same method to tear down their competitors.</p>



<p>You only need to complete one step: become a Reddit mod in one of the main subreddits for your industry. If you do that and the original mods of the subreddit don’t care what you do, you can completely fuck up your whole industry. Sow lies, fear, and misery at will.</p>



<p>Which means <em>anyone can do this to you</em>.</p>



<p>Reddit has become THE reputation attack vector.</p>



<p>And since Reddit is considered the default source of all human knowledge now, Reddit threads pop to the top of Google. Anyone searching for your brand will stumble into this madness. LLMs also prioritize Reddit so that narrative gets corrupted too. Getting control of one channel allows you to corrupt three major channels all at once. Most people don’t check receipts, they don’t dig for truth, they accept what’s put in front of them.</p>



<p>Reddit mods now control our search information ecosystem. Unpaid, corruptible Reddit mods.</p>



<p>I know there are good Reddit mods out there. But all it takes is one to fuck up your own business.</p>

    <!-- Claim 3 -->
    <article>
      <h3>Claim: Title 10 allows federal troop deployment here as used.</h3>
      <p>Reality: The Ninth Circuit’s stay lifts only the block on federalizing Oregon’s Guard, **not** on deploying any Guard units to Portland. The broader restraining order barring deployments from any state remains in force.</p>

    <article>
      <h3>Claim: California Guard can still be sent into Portland.</h3>
