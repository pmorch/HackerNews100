<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><center><img loading="lazy" src="https://quickwit.io/img/blog/2024-06-20-scaling-log-search-to-100-pb.png" alt="How Binance built a 100 PB log service with Quickwit"></center><p>Three years ago, we <a href="https://quickwit.io/blog/quickwit-first-release">open-sourced</a> Quickwit, a distributed search engine for large-scale datasets. Our goal was ambitious: to create a new breed of full-text search engine that is ten times more cost-efficient than Elasticsearch, significantly easier to configure and manage, and capable of scaling to petabytes of data <sup id="fnref-1-609909"><a href="#fn-1-609909">1</a></sup>.</p><p>While we knew the potential of Quickwit, our tests typically did not exceed 100 TB of data and 1 GB/s of indexing throughput. We lacked the real-world datasets and computing resources to test Quickwit at a multi-petabyte scale.</p><p>That is, until six months ago, when two engineers at Binance, the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange, discovered Quickwit and began experimenting with it. Within a few months, they achieved what we had only dreamed of: they successfully migrated multiple petabyte-scale Elasticsearch clusters to Quickwit, with remarkable achievements including:</p><ul><li>Scaling indexing to <strong>1.6 PB per day</strong>.</li><li>Operating a search cluster handling <strong>100 PB of logs</strong>.</li><li><strong>Saving millions of dollars</strong> annually by <strong>slashing compute costs by 80%</strong> and storage costs by 20x (for the same retention period).</li></ul><div><div><table><tbody><tr><th>Dataset</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Uncompressed Size</td><td>100 PB</td></tr><tr><td>Size on S3 (compressed)</td><td>20 PB</td></tr><tr><td>Num documents</td><td>181 trillions</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><table><tbody><tr><th>Indexing deployment</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Indexing throughput</td><td>1.6 PB / day</td></tr><tr><td>Num pods</td><td>700</td></tr><tr><td>Num vCPUs</td><td><span>4000</span><span> 2800*</span></td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td><span>6</span><span> 5.6*</span> TB</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div><div><table><tbody><tr><th>Search deployment</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Searchable dataset size</td><td>100 PB</td></tr><tr><td>Num pods</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Num vCPUs</td><td>1200</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>3 TB</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><table><tbody><tr><th>Infra costs vs. Elasticsearch</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Compute costs</td><td>5x reduction</td></tr><tr><td>Storage costs <br><small>for same retention</small></td><td>20x reduction</td></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div></div><small>*First figures initially published were wrong :/</small><p>In this blog post, I will share with you how Binance built a petabyte-scale log service and overcame the challenges of scaling Quickwit to multi-petabytes.</p><p>As the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange, Binance handles an enormous volume of transactions, each generating logs that are crucial for security, compliance, and operational insights. This results in processing roughly 21 million log lines per second, equivalent to 18.5 GB/s, or 1.6 PB per day.</p><p>To manage such a volume, Binance previously relied on 20 Elasticsearch clusters. Around 600 Vector pods were pulling logs from different Kafka topics and processing them before pushing them into Elasticsearch.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Binance ES setup" src="https://quickwit.io/assets/images/2024-06-20-binance-setup-kafka-vector-es-bc7ee32a83e8aae14aa3ec088d918244.png" width="1889" height="856"></p><p>However, this setup fell short of Binance's requirements in several critical areas:</p><ul><li><strong>Operational Complexity</strong>: Managing numerous Elasticsearch clusters was becoming increasingly challenging and time-consuming.</li><li><strong>Limited Retention</strong>: Binance was retaining most logs for only a few days. Their goal was to extend this to months, requiring the storage and management of 100 PB of logs, which was prohibitively expensive and complex with their Elasticsearch setup.</li><li><strong>Limited Reliability</strong>: Elasticsearch clusters with high ingestion throughput were configured without replication to limit infrastructure costs, compromising durability and availability.</li></ul><p>The team knew they needed a radical change to meet their growing needs for log management, retention, and analysis.</p><p>When Binance's engineers discovered Quickwit, they quickly realized it offered several key advantages over their existing setup:</p><ul><li><strong>Native Kafka integration</strong>: It allows ingesting logs directly from Kafka with exactly-once semantics, providing huge operational benefits. Concretely speaking, you can tear down your cluster, recreate it in a minute without losing any data, ready to ingest at 1.6 PB/day or search through petabytes, and scale up and down to handle temporary spikes.</li><li><strong>Built-in VRL transformations</strong> (Vector Remap Language): As Quickwit supports VRL, it eliminates the need for hundreds of Vector pods to handle log transformations.</li><li><strong>Object storage as the primary storage</strong>: All indexed data remains on object storage, removing the need for provisioning and managing storage on the cluster side.</li><li><strong>Better data compression</strong>: Quickwit typically achieves 2x better compression than Elasticsearch, further reducing the storage footprint of indexes.</li></ul><p>However, no users had scaled Quickwit to multi-petabytes, and any engineer knows that scaling a system by a factor of 10 or 100 can reveal unexpected issues. This did not stop them, and they were ready to take on the challenge!</p><center><img loading="lazy" src="https://quickwit.io/img/blog/2024-06-20-challenge-accepted.jpg" alt="Searching 100 PB, Challenge accepted" width="400"></center><p>Binance rapidly scaled its indexing thanks to the Kafka datasource. One month into their Quickwit PoC, they were indexing at several GB/s.</p><p>This quick progress was largely due to how Quickwit works with Kafka: Quickwit uses Kafka's consumer groups to distribute the workload across multiple pods. Each pod indexes a subset of the Kafka partitions and updates the metastore with the latest offsets, ensuring exactly-once semantics. This setup makes Quickwit's indexers stateless: you can tear down your entire cluster and restart it, and the indexers will resume from where they left off as if nothing happened.</p><p>However, Binance's scale revealed two main issues:</p><ul><li><strong>Cluster Stability Issues</strong>: A few months ago, Quickwit’s gossip protocol (called <a href="https://github.com/quickwit-oss/chitchat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chitchat</a>) struggled with hundreds of pods: some indexers would leave the cluster and rejoin, making the indexing throughput unstable.</li><li><strong>Uneven Workload Distribution</strong>: Binance uses several Quickwit indexes for their logs, with varying indexing throughputs. Some have a high throughput of several GB/s, others just a few MB/s. Quickwit's placement algorithm does not spread its workload evenly. This is a known <a href="https://github.com/quickwit-oss/quickwit/issues/4630" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue</a>, and we will work on this later this year.</li></ul><p>To work around these limitations, Binance deployed separate indexing clusters for each high-throughput topic, keeping one cluster for smaller topics. Isolating each high-throughput cluster did not impose an operational burden thanks to stateless indexers. Additionally, all Vector pods were removed as Binance used Vector transformation directly in Quickwit.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Binance Quickwit setup" src="https://quickwit.io/assets/images/2024-06-20-binance-setup-kafka-quickwit-5326a36908ce42113ac90fccaf3799e6.png" width="2110" height="1183"></p><p>After several months of migration and optimization, Binance finally achieved an indexing throughput of 1.6 PB with 10 Quickwit indexing clusters, 700 pods requesting around 2800 vCPU and 6 TB of memory, that's 6.6 MB/s per vCPU on average. On a given high-throughput Kafka topic, this figure goes up to 11 MB/s per vCPU.</p><p>Next challenge to come: scaling search!</p><p>With Quickwit now capable of efficiently indexing 1.6 PB daily, the challenge shifted to searching through petabytes of logs. With 10 clusters, Binance would normally need to deploy searcher pods for each cluster, undermining one of Quickwit’s strengths: pooling searcher resources to hit the object storage shared by all indexes.</p><p>To avoid this pitfall, Binance's engineers devised a clever workaround: they created a unified metastore by replicating all metadata from each indexing cluster metastore into one PostgreSQL database. This unified metastore enables the deployment of one unique centralized search cluster capable of searching through all indexes!</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quickwit multi clusters setup" src="https://quickwit.io/assets/images/2024-06-20-quickwit-multi-indexers-clusters-setup-f83edb0ef91fcc35680e31469c451eb1.png" width="1966" height="1098"></p><p>As we speak, Binance now manages a reasonably sized cluster of 30 searcher pods, each requesting 40 vCPU and 100GB memory. To give you an idea, you only need 5 searchers (8 vCPU, 6GB memory requests) to find the needle in the haystack in 400 TB of logs. Binance runs those types of queries on petabytes but also aggregation queries, hence the higher resource requests.</p><p>Overall, Binance's migration to Quickwit was a huge success and brought several substantial benefits:</p><ul><li>80% reduction in computing resources compared to Elasticsearch.</li><li>Storage costs reduced by a factor of 20 for the same retention period.</li><li>Economically viable solution for large-scale log management, both in terms of infrastructure costs and maintenance operations.</li><li>Minimal configuration tweaking, working efficiently once the right number of pods and resources were determined.</li><li>Increased log retention to one or several months, depending on the log type, improving internal troubleshooting capabilities.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, Binance’s migration from Elasticsearch to Quickwit has been an exciting 6-month experience between Binance and Quickwit engineers, and we are very proud of this collaboration. We have already planned improvements in data compression, multi-cluster support, and better workload spread with Kafka datasources.</p><p>Huge kudos to Binance's engineers for their work and insights throughout this migration &lt;3</p></main></div></div>]]></description>

<p>About a week ago, my home Internet (AT&amp;T Fiber) went from the ~1 Gbps I pay for down to about 100 Mbps (<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/monitor-your-internet-raspberry-pi">see how I monitor my home Internet with a Pi</a>). It wasn't too inconvenient, and I considered waiting it out to see if the speed recovered at some point, because latency was fine.</p>

<p>But as you can see around 7/7 on that graph, the 100 Mbps went down to about <em>eight</em>, and that's the point where my wife starts noticing how slow the Internet is. Action level.</p>

<p>So I fired up AT&amp;T's support chat. I'm a programmer, I can usually find ways around the wily ways of chatbots.</p>

<p>Except AT&amp;T's AI-powered chatbot seems to have a fiendish tendency to equate 'WiFi' with 'Internet', no doubt due to so many people thinking they are one and the same.</p>

<p><img width="500" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/att-chatbot-slow-internet-not-wifi.png" alt="ATT Chatbot - Slow Internet not WiFi"></p>

<p>We were stuck in that loop for about 5 minutes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It looks like you're having trouble with your WiFi.</p>
  
  <p><em>No.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After working a few different angles, I finally 'spammed 0'<sup id="fnref:olddays"><a href="#fn:olddays" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> by entering some variation of 'connect me to a support rep'.</p>

<p><img width="300" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/att-chatbot-connect-to-support-rep.png" alt="ATT Chatbot - connect me to support rep"></p>

<p>I'll cut to the chase—after repeating some variation of that about 8 times, eventually I got queued up in the 20 minute line to a human support rep.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me, the human support rep, like so many in the industry, promptly ignored the data I provided in my first chat message to him<sup id="fnref:message"><a href="#fn:message" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and told me switching WiFi channels on the device (on which WiFi is currently disabled completely) would solve my issue. <em>At no cost.</em></p>

<p><img width="300" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/att-chat-support-wifi.png" alt="ATT Support Rep - WiFi is not the problem"></p>

<p>Maybe I should welcome our AI overlords?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>When parents are asked to identify their top fears about the safety of their children, what do you think tops the list? According to a survey last year by </span><a href="https://www.safehome.org/family-safety/parenting-in-america-report/" rel="">Safehome.org</a><span>, it’s not cars, strangers, or any other physical threat; it’s “internet/social media.” That’s not just for parents of teenagers and pre-teens, whose lives seem to revolve around their phones. It’s even true for parents of younger kids, ages 7-9 because every parent sees it coming and few know what to do about it. Parents don’t want their children to disappear into phones, as so many of their friends' children have; some resolve to </span><a href="https://www.waituntil8th.org/" rel="">wait until 8th grade</a><span>, or later. Then their child hits them with the main argument that makes parents buckle: “But everyone else has a phone, so I’m being left out.”</span></p><p><span>For parents who resisted, or who plan to resist, a new report may encourage many more parents to join you: </span><a href="https://sapienlabs.org/" rel="">Sapien Labs</a><span>, which runs an </span><a href="https://sapienlabs.org/global-mind-project/" rel="">ongoing global survey</a><span> of mental health with nearly a million participants so far, </span><a href="https://sapienlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sapien-Labs-Age-of-First-Smartphone-and-Mental-Wellbeing-Outcomes.pdf" rel="">released a “Rapid Report” today</a><span> on a question they added in January asking young adults (those between ages 18 and 24): </span><em>“At what age did you get your own smartphone or tablet (e.g. iPad) with Internet access that you could carry with you?”</em><span>&nbsp; When they plot the age of first smartphone on the X axis against their extensive set of questions about mental health on the Y axis, they find a consistent pattern: </span><em>the younger the age of getting the first smartphone, the worse the mental health that the young adult reports today.</em><span> This is true in all the regions studied (the survey is offered in English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Arabic, Hindi, and Swahili), and the relationships are consistently stronger for women.</span></p><p>We believe these findings have important implications for parents, heads of K-12 schools, and legislators currently considering bills to raise minimum ages or require age verification for some kinds of sites (especially social media and pornography). We’ll address those implications at the end of this post. But first: what did Sapien Labs do, and what did they find?</p><p><span>Sapien Labs is a non-profit research foundation with the goal of understanding how the rapidly changing social and technological environment is changing human brains and minds. Their main research project has been the </span><a href="https://sapienlabs.org/global-mind-project/" rel="">Global Mind Project</a><span>, an ongoing program that tracks mental well-being around the world using a comprehensive assessment of mental health along with questions about demographics and various cultural, technological, and lifestyle factors. They have issued a </span><a href="https://sapienlabs.org/research-and-reports/" rel="">variety of reports on the state of mental health around the world</a><span>. Among their most important findings is that in all the regions they’ve studied, mental health is worst for the youngest generations.</span></p><p><span>It didn’t used to be this way. There is a well-known finding in happiness research that, </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-020-00797-z" rel="">across nearly all nations</a><span>, happiness or well-being forms a U-shaped curve across the lifespan (See </span><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781466891234/thehappinesscurve" rel="">Rauch, 2018</a><span>). Young adults and people in their 60s and 70s are happier than those in middle age. But that may be changing, </span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.837638/full" rel="">especially for women</a><span>, as Gen Z (born in and after 1996) enters young adulthood. You can see the sudden collapse of young adult mental health in some of our </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/the-teen-mental-illness-epidemic" rel="">previous</a><span> </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/international-mental-illness-part-one" rel="">posts</a><span> on this Substack. For example, Figure 1 shows that up until 2011, young Canadian women were the </span><em>most</em><span> likely to report having excellent or very good mental health. By 2015 they were the</span><em> least</em><span> likely, and the decline in their self-reported mental health accelerated after that, while it changed very little for older women. (The same pattern holds for </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/international-mental-illness-part-one" rel="">Canadian men</a><span>, but to a lesser degree.)</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6432f83-2793-4a51-b24b-5cb5ff86a30f_1350x930.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6432f83-2793-4a51-b24b-5cb5ff86a30f_1350x930.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6432f83-2793-4a51-b24b-5cb5ff86a30f_1350x930.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6432f83-2793-4a51-b24b-5cb5ff86a30f_1350x930.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6432f83-2793-4a51-b24b-5cb5ff86a30f_1350x930.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6432f83-2793-4a51-b24b-5cb5ff86a30f_1350x930.png" width="1350" height="930" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f6432f83-2793-4a51-b24b-5cb5ff86a30f_1350x930.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:930,&quot;width&quot;:1350,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;trends in very good mental health in canada.

Is it just a coincidence that the first global generation to grow up on smartphones became the first global generation to have lower well-being than the one before them?&nbsp;</p><p>Sapien Labs uses a comprehensive assessment of mental well-being that asks participants about 47 elements of mental, social, and emotional functioning on a life impact scale. These 47 elements are aggregated into a single score called the Mental Health Quotient (MHQ), which gives extra weight to patterns that indicate severe problems. It also uses subsets of these 47 elements to create scores along six domains: Mood &amp; Outlook, Social Self, Adaptability &amp; Resilience, Drive &amp; Motivation, Cognition, and Mind-Body Connection.&nbsp;</p><p><span>(You can take the </span><a href="https://sapienlabs.org/mhq/" rel="">MHQ yourself</a><span> and you can request </span><a href="https://sapienlabs.org/global-mind-project/researcher-hub/" rel="">access to the full dataset</a><span>.

The second important feature is their international coverage. So, let’s zoom in and explore the six domain scores that make up the MHQ, first for the global sample, and then for the region and culture we know best: the Anglosphere.</p><p><span>As you’ll see if you read </span><a href="https://sapienlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sapien-Labs-Age-of-First-Smartphone-and-Mental-Wellbeing-Outcomes.pdf" rel="">the full report</a><span>, the next step after examining the overall MHQ scores is to examine scores on the six domains of mental functioning:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>Mood &amp; Outlook</strong><span>: Includes items about optimism, calmness, anxiety, mood swings, sadness, and anger.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Social Self</strong><span>: Includes items about self-worth, relationships with others, empathy, cooperation, aggression toward others&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Adaptability &amp; Resilience</strong><span>: includes items about adaptability to change, ability to learn, and emotional resilience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Drive &amp; Motivation</strong><span>: Includes items about motivation, curiosity, enthusiasm, and addictions.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Cognition</strong><span>: Includes items about memory, decision-making and risk-taking, focus, and concentration, unwanted thoughts, hallucinations</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Mind-Body Connection:</strong><span> Includes items about sleep quality, energy level, appetite, and physical health issues.&nbsp;</span></p></li></ul><p>Figure 3 shows that for young women, all six domain scores show the same basic pattern as the MHQ: a consistent rise. You can also see that a few of the domains seem to rise more slowly or level off somewhat after the age of 13 or 14: Drive and motivation, Mind-body connection, and Cognition. However, the other three dimensions continue to rise all the way to age 18. The domain that rises fastest, meaning that it is most highly correlated with age of first smartphone, is the “social self” domain.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png" width="1300" height="1168" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1168,&quot;width&quot;:1300,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Mental Health Quotient Dimension Scores by age of first smartphone, Women&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Mental Health Quotient Dimension Scores by age of first smartphone, Women" title="Mental Health Quotient Dimension Scores by age of first smartphone, Women" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffbff8dea-3dc7-4bef-9c12-a7bfcdd73794_1300x1168.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em><strong>Figure 3:</strong><span> The 6 domains of well-being, for young women, as a function of when they got their first smartphone.

For example, in the Sapien Labs dataset, in the less wealthy countries such as India, few young adults had received a smartphone before the age of 10, which means that the data points on the left sides of the graphs contain almost no Indians, whereas the data points on the right side (no phone until 17 or 18) contain many Indians and fewer from the USA. If Indians are mentally healthier than Americans (for other reasons), this could cause the lines to slope even if smartphones had no effect on mental health. It is important, therefore, to look at individual countries and regions. (The Sapien Labs report does this in its appendix, where you can see that the trends hold for each of the world regions).&nbsp;</p><p><span>The region that we (Jon and Zach) know best and have </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/international-mental-illness-part-one" rel="">written on</a><span> </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1diMvsMeRphUH7E6D1d_J7R6WbDdgnzFHDHPx9HXzR5o/edit#" rel="">extensively</a><span> is the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglosphere" rel="">Anglosphere</a><span> (the English-speaking countries of The United States, Canada, The United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and sometimes Ireland).

Delays beyond age 12 do not seem to be related to further increases in MHQ scores.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-121478547" href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/sapien-smartphone-report#footnote-4-121478547" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03fcda37-b410-4509-b8bf-4d67ecba5b6f_916x836.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03fcda37-b410-4509-b8bf-4d67ecba5b6f_916x836.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03fcda37-b410-4509-b8bf-4d67ecba5b6f_916x836.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03fcda37-b410-4509-b8bf-4d67ecba5b6f_916x836.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03fcda37-b410-4509-b8bf-4d67ecba5b6f_916x836.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03fcda37-b410-4509-b8bf-4d67ecba5b6f_916x836.png" width="916" height="836" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/03fcda37-b410-4509-b8bf-4d67ecba5b6f_916x836.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:836,&quot;width&quot;:916,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Mental health quotient by age of smartphone in the Anglosphere&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Mental health quotient by age of smartphone in the Anglosphere" title="Mental health quotient by age of smartphone in the Anglosphere" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03fcda37-b410-4509-b8bf-4d67ecba5b6f_916x836.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03fcda37-b410-4509-b8bf-4d67ecba5b6f_916x836.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03fcda37-b410-4509-b8bf-4d67ecba5b6f_916x836.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03fcda37-b410-4509-b8bf-4d67ecba5b6f_916x836.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em><strong>Figure 6.</strong><span> Anglosphere countries only: As age of first smartphone goes up, so does the mental health reported by young adults, especially for women.

They added the question about age of first smartphone in January and they are publishing a report, with data from nearly 28,000 participants, in May. We believe that this ability to move quickly is a public service during a global pandemic of teen mental illness. While their rapid report is not a standard academic publication and has not been through peer review (which often takes a year or more), the open access to the data has allowed us to investigate and confirm the trends they are reporting. We hope and expect that other researchers will download the dataset and offer critiques of the data, the analyses, and the conclusions drawn. This sort of “</span><a href="https://scholarlyassessmentreports.org/articles/10.29024/sar.26" rel="">post-publication peer review</a><span>” is becoming increasingly common as the problems with the existing peer review system become more widely known.</span></p><p><span>One issue to keep in mind with the Sapien Labs dataset is that the participants in each country are not a random or representative sample of the people in that country. Such studies would be extremely expensive to run, and now that so few people agree to phone solicitations or even answer their phones, it is unclear how representative such surveys can be. Those who agree to be interviewed, or who are motivated by money to participate, are not representative of the broader population. For this Sapien Labs report, participants came to the site on their own, or from online advertisements paid for by Sapien Labs, for the purpose of getting a detailed report on their wellbeing. So, the means reported for any country should not be treated like direct measures of the true means. However, samples such as these are still very useful for examining differences </span><em>within</em><span> the sample, such as those between men and women, or between those who got a smartphone early and those who got one late. And the much larger size of the Sapien Labs dataset, compared to Gallup and other survey organizations, allows for many additional analyses.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>A second factor to keep in mind is that like all surveys, what we get is correlational data that is open to alternative interpretations. The graphs in the report are likely to suggest to most readers that getting a smartphone early </span><em>causes</em><span> later mental health problems. But with correlational data we must always consider the possibility that the causal arrow could run in reverse. In this case: having low well-being as a young adult could </span><em>cause</em><span> people to believe that they got a smartphone earlier than they did, but this seems unlikely. We must also always consider that there could be “third variables” that cause both of the first two variables to rise. In this case, one plausible confounding third variable is </span><a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/permissive_parenting_style#:~:text=Permissive%20parents%20are%20not%20demanding,than%20children%20of%20a%20parent." rel="">permissive parenting</a><span>. Perhaps permissive parents (in each country) simultaneously do two things: they give their kids smartphones at very young ages, and they also give them few boundaries and little structure, which then interferes with development and produces struggling young adults. While this hypothesis is plausible and should be investigated, it is not clear how it would explain the fact that, in all the regions studied, it is the </span><em>girls</em><span> who show a tighter connection between early phone acquisition and later mental health problems, just as it is the girls who show a </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(18)30060-9/fulltext" rel="">tighter connection between heavy social media use</a><span> and concurrent mental health problems. Nor would it explain why mental health dropped so rapidly in the early 2010s (especially for girls) if permissive parenting (or some other variable about family life) was the real culprit.</span></p><p><span>And finally, we note that no one study is definitive, and more research is needed. We have been able to find a </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X22001439" rel="">few</a><span> </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17482798.2020.1725902" rel="">other</a><span> </span><a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.13851" rel="">studies</a><span> that </span><a href="https://wheatley.byu.edu/00000182-8d78-dff6-afab-8ffd11ce0001/teaching-by-example-pdf" rel="">examined</a><span> the age at which children got their first smartphones (We have created a new appendix [8.14] in our collaborative review doc on </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w-HOfseF2wF9YIpXwUUtP65-olnkPyWcgF5BiAtBEy0/edit#" rel="">Social Media and Mental Health</a><span>). So far they are mostly smaller studies that have produced mixed results. If you know of any others, please add them to the doc or put a link to them in the comments below. We want to get this right.</span></p><p><span>We cannot be </span><em>certain</em><span> that the correlations shown in the data are evidence of causality, but we think it is appropriate for those who care for children to act on the </span><em>preponderance</em><span> of the evidence (which is the standard in a civil trial) rather than waiting for evidence </span><em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em><span>(which is the standard used in a criminal trial. See proposition 2 in </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/why-some-researchers-think-im-wrong" rel="">this post</a><span>.) There is </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gojn35zOhnhfgdgquf5Tj4VsZk7Gtugt-eYS-2fQnpE/edit#" rel="">increasing evidence</a><span> that smartphones have a variety of detrimental effects on child development including reductions of sleep, focus, and time with friends in person, along with increases in addictive behaviors, so it makes sense that the cumulative effect of getting one’s first phone in elementary school would be larger than for those who don’t get a phone until high school. This is an important point made in the Sapien Labs report: The relationships they find suggest that there is a </span><em>cumulative effect</em><span> of having had a smartphone (and its many apps) over many years of childhood; they do not represent the effects of having used a phone a lot in recent days or weeks (which is the focus of </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w-HOfseF2wF9YIpXwUUtP65-olnkPyWcgF5BiAtBEy0/edit" rel="">most of the published research</a><span>).</span></p><p><span>We think the implications for action are strongest for policies related to children and younger teens––those still in elementary and middle school (that is, age 14 and below) In most of the graphs in this post, including those for the Anglosphere, the slopes of the lines are steepest for those ages, and the links are visible for boys as well as girls (though smaller for boys). This concern to protect children before and during early puberty is consistent with a </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29296-3" rel="">study published last year</a><span> which found that in a large longitudinal study of British adolescents, the peak years for evidence of links between social media use and lower satisfaction with life were 11-13 for girls (which corresponds to the early part of puberty), while for boys (who begin puberty a bit later) it was 14-15.</span></p><p>On the other hand, the implications for action related to older teens and especially boys are less clear, at least within the United States and other Anglosphere nations. The lines for boys are somewhat flat in those ages, and the increases for girls generally slow down too. Furthermore, the arguments for why high school students need a smartphone (rather than an alternative, such as a flip-phone) are stronger than the arguments for why elementary and middle school students need one.&nbsp;</p><p>We, therefore, believe that the Sapien Labs findings should motivate us to think carefully about whether and when to give children their own smart devices, especially before high school. It is not the Internet per se that is harmful; so much of the internet is fantastically educational, useful, and entertaining. The most relevant questions, we think, are: 1) At what age do you want to give a child continuous access to the internet and social media, even when away from home, even when sitting in class? 2) At what age do you want to give social media companies, and other companies, continuous access to a child’s attention? And 3) does a child really need a smartphone when other kinds of phones (such as “flip phones” or Light Phones) work just as well for general communication (phone calls and texting)?</p><p><span>The group </span><a href="https://www.waituntil8th.org/" rel="">Wait Until 8th</a><span> was founded to solve the collective action problem that parents and teens are in: Even if most parents wanted to wait until high school to give their children smartphones and social media, as long as most kids have those things by 6th grade, there will be enormous pressure on their children, and hence on the parents, to relent. Unless the parents can coordinate. So Wait Until 8th asks parents to sign a pledge, when their children are in elementary school, that they will wait until 8th grade to give them a smartphone. The pledge only takes effect once ten families in that child’s grade have signed the pledge so that the child will have a community of peers and will not feel so isolated before 8th grade.</span></p><p>We think this is a great idea, we just suggest that the pledge should be: Wait Until 9th. Or Wait Until High School. Children are usually 12 or 13 at the start of 8th grade; that is still within the period of early puberty. Plus, if 8th graders have smartphones, that means that smartphones will be everywhere in middle schools, increasing the desire of 7th graders to get them. To solve collective action problems, we think it’s best to focus on setting good norms within collectives (such as schools): make elementary schools and middle schools be smartphone free.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Parents understandably want to be able to reach their children when they are away from home, and a flip phone or other “dumbphone” is a very reasonable first phone that allows parents and children to reach each other. We suggest that parents not give smartphones as first phones. Let children learn to master a simpler kind of phone, one that cannot be loaded with addictive apps. Wait Until 8th offers an </span><a href="https://www.waituntil8th.org/devices" rel="">excellent list</a><span> of the many smartphone alternatives.</span></p><p><span>Many of the teachers and heads of schools that Jon talks to are bitter about the effects of smartphones on their students and their school culture. They complain about the constant drama unfolding on social media during the school day. They complain about the distraction and the increased difficulty of getting students’ attention during class, since many students sneak looks at their frequently-buzzing phones, especially those sitting in the back rows. Many schools say that they ban phones, but what they often seem to mean is “the rule is that you can’t take out your phone during class.” That means that some students (the ones most suffering from phone addiction) will learn to do it stealthily, and many of the rest will just pull out their phones as soon as class is over, thereby </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103122000634" rel="">missing out on face-to-face interactions</a><span> with the students right next to them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We suggest that schools consider going phone free, meaning that students can use their phones to arrive and depart from school, but once they enter, their phones (smart or dumb) would be placed in a phone locker, or in a lockable pouch. We think the case for doing this in elementary schools and middle schools is strongest. In a few weeks, Jon will write a substack post laying out the empirical evidence that smartphones distract students and disrupt education, </span><a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/691462" rel="">even when they are kept in students’ pockets</a><span>.</span></p><p>We also suggest that school districts collaborate with social scientists to do experiments on entire schools, rather than on individual students. What if a state or district identified 20 middle schools that were willing to cooperate, and then randomly assigned half of them to go phone free?&nbsp; There is no research of this kind that we can find, yet such a simple study would give us results within a single year that could potentially yield findings that improve both mental health and educational outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p><span>If there is a cumulative effect of smartphone ownership in childhood, and if the effect is due in part to heavy use of certain kinds of apps (such as social media) rather than other kinds of apps (such as watching movies, or using Wikipedia), then it becomes even more vital that we develop ways of age-gating certain apps and content. At present, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act" rel="">US law sets a minimum age of 13</a><span> at which children can sign contracts with companies to give away their data (when they check a box on the terms of service). But </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-13-became-the-internets-age-of-adulthood-11560850201" rel="">the law was written such that</a><span> the companies are not required to verify ages. As long as a child </span><em>says</em><span> that she is 13 or older, she’s in and can create a social media account.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This must change. If the minimum age were enforced, it would help parents solve their collective action problem, at least with regard to Instagram, Tiktok, and other social media sites for underage users. It is precisely Congress’s failure to enforce the age 13 rule that puts parents in the trap. Many states are now introducing legislation to remedy this omission. And there is one federal bill that does a particularly good job of focusing on age limits and age verification: The </span><a href="https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-cotton-murphy-britt-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-help-protect-kids-from-harmful-impacts-of-social-media" rel="">Protecting Kids on Social Media Act</a><span>, introduced by Senators Schatz (D-HI), Cotton (R-AR), Murphy (D-CT), and Britt (R-AL). The act would “set a minimum age of 13 to use social media apps and would require parental consent for 13 through 17 year-olds.&nbsp; The bill would also prevent social media companies from feeding content using algorithms to users under the age of 18.” The bill also requires social media companies to develop rigorous age verification methods. (There are already many in existence, and many more would appear if the bill gets passed.) We also think the </span><a href="https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2023/5/blackburn-blumenthal-introduce-bipartisan-kids-online-safety-act" rel="">Kids Online Safety Act of 2022</a><span>, introduced by senators Blumenthal (D-CT) and Blackburn (R-TN) would do a lot to make social media less damaging to children, and easier for parents to control. The fact that so many bills are bipartisan, at both the state and federal level, is a very encouraging sign in our polarized time. Legislators often report seeing the problems in their own children.</span></p><p><strong>In conclusion:</strong><span> there is a great deal that can be done, individually and collectively, to address one of the top fears that parents express, about the safety and health of their children. The Sapien Labs data offers us new insight into the nature of the problem, and it alerts us that the problem may be global. It also guides us to the ages at which reform efforts are most likely to work.</span></p><p>POSTSCRIPTS (added on May 18, 2023)</p><p>1—We welcome additional and deeper analyses of the Sapien Labs data, and will post links here to such reports whether they support or contradict our analyses in this post.</p><p><span>2—One issue we should have discussed in the text is the inclusion of </span><em>tablets</em><span>, along with smartphones, in the Sapien Labs’ questionnaire. If their findings differ from those of other labs which asked only about age of first </span><em>smartphone</em><span>, then we won’t know whether part of the difference is the inclusion of tablets. We hope that future studies will ask about the two devices separately to figure out which devices are associated with harm at which ages (if any). </span></p><p>3—Some commentary online has made the important point that it’s not the phone itself which is harmful; it is the particular apps that the child uses, a child with a particular personality, in the context of a particular family that does (or does not) exercise oversight and apply restrictions. We agree. The original iPhone introduced by Steve Jobs was three devices: a phone, an iPod, and a web browser. Great! Three tools. Probably not harmful. It’s the addition of the app store that turned the smartphone into a portal to everything. If early acquisition of a smartphone is shown to be reliably associated with developmental problems, it would likely be because it enables continuous 18-hour-per-day access to hundreds of activities. </p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In 2019, a startup called Nuvia came out of stealth mode. Nuvia was notable because its leadership included several notable chip architects, including <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/01/apple_nuvia_lawsuit/">one who used to work for Apple</a>. Apple chips like the M1 drew recognition for landing in the same performance neighborhood as AMD and Intel’s offerings while offering better power efficiency. Nuvia had similar goals, aiming to create a power efficient core that could could surpass designs from AMD, Apple, Arm, and Intel. Qualcomm acquired Nuvia in 2021, bringing its staff into Qualcomm’s internal CPU efforts.</p>

<p>Bringing on Nuvia staff rejuvenated Qualcomm’s internal CPU efforts, which led to the Oryon core in Snapdragon X Elite. Oryon arrives nearly five years after Nuvia hit the news, and almost eight years after Qualcomm last released a smartphone SoC with internally designed cores. For people following Nuvia’s developments, it has been a long wait.</p>

<p>Now, thanks to the wonderful folks who donate to our <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ChipsandCheese">Patreon members</a> and <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=4EMPH66SBGVSQ">Paypal donators</a>, we have a Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge 16 inch Laptop equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon X1E-80-100 CPU in our possession.</p>
<p>Note, because there has not been any upstreamed Device Tree for this laptop, we were not able to get a Linux desktop installed on it so a lot of our testing had to be done on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).</p>
<h2>System Architecture</h2>
<p>The Snapdragon X1E-80-10 implements 12 Oryon cores in three quad-core clusters, each with a 12 MB L2 cache. Like Kryo in the Snapdragon 820, Qualcomm opted against a hybrid core configuration. Instead, Snapdragon X Elite’s Oryon CPU clusters run at different maximum clocks to offer a combination of good single threaded and multithreaded performance.</p>

<p>Snapdragon X Elite’s clustered arrangement is clearly visible from a core to core latency test, which bounces cachelines between core pairs and measures how long that takes. Transfers within a core are handled reasonably quickly, but cross-cluster transfers incur high latency especially for a monolithic chip with consumer core counts.</p>

<p>Latencies are less consistent compared to Qualcomm’s prior attempt at making a laptop chip. The 8cx Gen 3 has four Cortex X1 cores and four Cortex A78 cores. It likely uses Arm’s DSU interconnect, which also implements a shared L3 cache.</p>

<p>Nuvia’s co-founder used to work for Apple, making M1 is a notable comparison point. Apple also uses quad core clusters with a shared L2. However, M1 uses a hybrid core arrangement. Core to core latency is similar within a cluster. Cross-cluster transfers incur high latency much like on Snapdragon X Elite, though absolute values are a bit better.</p>

<p>Snapdragon X Elite’s main competitors will be AMD’s Phoenix and Intel’s Meteor Lake. AMD’s Phoenix SoC has eight Zen 4 cores with 16 MB of L3. All eight of Phoenix’s cores are placed in the same cluster, so a core to core latency test is pretty boring to look at. Latencies are very low overall. However, it’s worth noting that AMD’s cross-cluster latencies on 16 core desktop Zen 4 variants is still better than Snapdragon X Elite or M1’s, at 80-90 ns.</p>

<p>Intel’s Meteor Lake has a complex hybrid setup with six Redwood Cove performance cores, eight Crestmont efficiency cores, and two Crestmont low power cores. The Redwood Cove and regular Cresmont cores share a 24 MB L3, while the low power Crestmont cluster makes do with a 2 MB L2 as its last level cache.</p>

<h2>Clock Behavior</h2>
<p>CPUs conserve power by reducing clocks when idle. Transitioning from idle to a high performance state takes time. On battery power, the Snapdragon X Elite doesn’t reach maximum clock speeds until over 110 ms after load is applied. This is almost certainly a deliberate policy on Samsung’s part to extend battery life by avoiding high power states during short bursts of activity. Intel’s Meteor Lake takes that strategy to the extreme, and does not reach maximum boost clocks on battery. AMD has a very fast boost policy on both wall and battery power, reaching 5 GHz in a millisecond or less.</p>

<p>On wall power, Samsung has opted not to let the CPU idle. This allows for better responsiveness because the cores start out at 3.4 GHz, and can reach 4 GHz in 1.44 milliseconds. However, it makes the laptop noticeably warm even at idle, a trait not shared by Meteor Lake or Phoenix.</p>
<h2>Core Overview</h2>
<p>Qualcomm’s Oryon is an 8-wide core with very high reordering capacity. True to its lineage, Oryon inherits philosophies from both Apple’s Firestorm and Qualcomm’s own much older Kryo. But unlike Kryo and M1, Oryon can run at 4 GHz and beyond. The top end Snapdragon X Elite SKU can reach 4.3 GHz on two cores. The X1E-80-100 we tested here can reach 4 GHz.</p>

<p>Zen 4 still has a clock speed advantage, but the gap isn’t as big with mobile. Next to Oryon, Zen 4’s architecture looks tiny. It’s only 6-wide and has smaller out-of-order buffers. However, Zen 4 can run at higher clock speeds. The Ryzen 7840HS can reach 5.1 GHz in the HP ZBook Firefly 14 G10 A.</p>

<p>Qualcomm states that Oryon has a 13 cycle misprediction penalty, which is the same as the common case for Zen 4.</p>
<h2>Branch Predictor</h2>
<p>The branch predictor is one of the best ways to get more performance per joule of energy spent. Modern CPUs therefore invest heavily in branch prediction. As core width and reordering capacity increase, an accurate branch predictor gets even more important because a mispredict tends to cause more wasted work.</p>
<h4>Direction Prediction</h4>
<p>The direction predictor does exactly as it sounds, it tells the branch predictor what direction the branch is likely to go. Oryon appears to have a single level direction predictor much like Golden Cove.</p>

<p>Oryon Branch Prediction Unit direction predictor does well against Golden Cove but does struggle against Zen 4.</p>

<h3>Branch Target Caching</h3>
<p>A branch predictor’s job can be simplified to telling the frontend what address it should fetch from next. Part of that involves determining whether a branch is taken. If it is, the predictor needs to tell the frontend where that branch goes with minimal delay. Branch Target Buffers (BTBs) cache branch destination addresses to speed that process up. Like any cache, different BTB implementations have varying performance characteristics. Modern CPUs often have multi-level BTBs too to get a balance between speed and ability to cope with large branch footprints.</p>
<p>Oryon appears to tie its BTB to the instruction cache, as taken branches see higher latency as the test loop spills out of the instruction cache. Branches contained within a 8 KB footprint can be handled with single cycle latency, something AMD calls “zero bubble” branching. Applications with a larger branch footprint can do one taken branch every three cycles, as long as code fits in the 192 KB L1 instruction cache.</p>

<p>Qualcomm could have a branch address calculator placed early in the decode pipeline. With that interpretation, Oryon would have a 8 KB L0 instruction cache with single cycle latency. The 192 KB L1i would have 3 cycle latency. Oryon’s BTB setup has parallels to Kryo’s, as both cores enjoy fast branching as long as the test fits within 8 KB. It also shares traits with M1, which also sees taken branch latency increase as the test exceeds certain code footprint sizes. M1 however only gets single cycle branching within 4 KB.</p>

<p>AMD’s Zen 4, as well as Arm Ltd and Intel cores for that matter, decouple their branch target caching from the instruction cache. Clam’s BTB test sees higher latency once branches exceed certain counts, with branch spacing being less of a factor.</p>

<h3>Indirect Branch Prediction</h3>
<p>Indirect branches can go to more than one target, adding another degree of difficulty to prediction. Oryon appears to have a 2048 entry indirect branch predictor.</p>

<p>Oryon’s indirect predictor isn’t as big as Zen 4’s 3072 entry indirect branch predictor and can’t track as many targets. But unlike Zen 4, there is no slowly increasing penalty after 32 targets for a single branch. This likely means that Oryon doesn’t use a similar mechanism to Zen 4. Now comparing Oryon to Golden Cove and they are very similar to each other but Oryon can track more targets than Golden Cove can.</p>
<p>Returns are a special case of indirect branches. Oryon has a deep 48 entry return stack. Zen 4 for comparison has a 32 entry return stack. Both are quite deep, and likely enough to handle the vast majority of code. Qualcomm’s strategy mirrors that of Apple M1’s Firestorm architecture, which <a href="https://twitter.com/dougallj/status/1580826539205496832">apparently has a 50 entry return stack</a>.</p>

<p>When return stack capacity is exceeded, Oryon sees a sharp increase in call+return time. 4-5 ns would be 15-18 cycles at 3.7 GHz, which is high enough to be a branch mispredict. That’s similar to what Dougall discovered on Apple’s M1 too, and suggests the core clears the return stack when it overflows instead of implementing a mechanism to more gracefully handle that case.</p>
<h2>Fetch and Decode</h2>
<p>Next, the frontend has to fetch instructions from memory and decode them into micro-ops. Oryon and Apple’s Firestorm cores use a very similar strategy. Both have a huge 192 KB L1 instruction cache feeding a 8-wide decoder. AMD’s Zen 4 enjoys high instruction bandwidth for small instruction footprints, but sustained bandwidth is restricted by Zen 4’s 6-wide rename stage downstream. Compared to Oryon and Firestorm, Zen 4c’s small 32 KB instruction cache is a distinct disadvantage.</p>

Zen 4 is capped at 6 micro-ops per cycle. Throughput from the micro-op cache is higher in this simple test because Zen 4 fuses adjacent NOPs into a single micro-op</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>However, AMD maintains high frontend bandwidth for very large code footprints, as it can sustain more than 12 bytes per cycle even when pulling code from L3. Oryon and M1 have much lower code fetch bandwidth after a L1i miss.</p>
<h2>Rename/Allocate</h2>
<p>Micro-ops from the frontend need to have backend resources allocated to track them during out-of-order execution. That process involves register renaming to break false write-after-write dependencies. The renamer can break other dependencies as well by creatively allocating backend resources. For example, an instruction that moves values between registers can be eliminated by having its “result” point to the source register. Instructions known to set a register to zero can similarly be optimized.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Oryon IPC</td><td>Zen 4 IPC</td><td>Redwood Cove IPC</td></tr><tr><td>Independent MOVs</td><td>7.4</td><td>5.73</td><td>4.77</td></tr><tr><td>Dependent MOVs</td><td>1.18</td><td>5.71</td><td>5.25</td></tr><tr><td>XOR/EOR r, r</td><td>1</td><td>5.73</td><td>4.05</td></tr><tr><td>MOV r, 0</td><td>5.32</td><td>3.77</td><td>4.97</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Oryon has move elimination, though it’s not as robust as Intel or AMD’s implementation for chained dependent MOVs. There’s no zeroing idiom recognition for XOR-ing a register with itself, or subtracting a register from itself. Moving an immediate value of zero to a register works of course for breaking dependencies. However, throughput for that doesn’t exceed 6 IPC and suggests Oryon still uses an ALU pipe to write zero to a register.</p>
<h2>Out of Order Execution</h2>
<p>Oryon features a massive out-of-order execution engine to hide latency and extract instruction level parallelism. Its reorder buffer, which helps commit instruction results in program order, is massive with 680 entries. Both the integer and floating point register files have 384 entries available for speculative results. Add another 32 entries for known-good architectural register values, and that comes out to 416 total entries.</p>

<p>Memory ordering queues are more conservatively sized. The load and store queues have 192 and 56 entries respectively. While the load queue has comparable capacity to Redwood Cove’s and is appropriately sized to cover the reorder buffer, the store queue feels a bit small. It’s strange to see </p>

<p>Where Oryon really excels is scheduling capacity. Schedulers are expensive structures because every cycle, they have to check all their entries for micro-ops that are ready to execute. And, they have to see if results coming from freshly completed micro-ops make any pending micro-ops ready. Doing all those checks and comparisons can make schedulers area and power hungry. Qualcomm has likely kept costs down by associating each scheduling queue with one execution port, ensuring each scheduler only has to select one micro-op per cycle.</p>

<p>Oryon can bring an incredible 120 scheduler entries to bear for basic integer operations alone. It’s just short of Firestorm’s 134 entries, and far higher than Zen 4’s 96 entries. The gap between Oryon and Zen 4 is even wider because Zen 4’s ALU scheduling entries are shared with memory access operations. Intel’s Redwood Cove has 97 scheduling entries shared by integer and FP/vector operations.</p>
<p>On the FP/vector side, Oryon similarly has massive scheduling capacity. Arm CPUs traditionally featured weak vector execution, since handing throughput bound workloads would be difficult in a smartphone or tablet power budget. x86 applications however have different expectations, and users expect to carry out intensive tasks locally instead of sending them to be processed on a remote server. Oryon tackles this by feeding four 128-bit execution ports with a total of 192 scheduler entries. All four pipes can handle basic floating point and vector integer operations.</p>

<p>In that respect Oryon is very similar to Firestorm, though the two cores differ in how they handle less common operations. Firestorm also stands apart in using smaller (though still large in an absolute sense) schedulers, and compensating for that with a non-scheduling queue that can delay a stall at the rename stage.</p>
<p>AMD again has the lowest scheduling capacity, instead using a huge non-scheduling queue to prevent full schedulers from causing stalls further up the pipeline. Still, Zen 4’s buffering capacity for incomplete FP/vector operations falls far short of Oryon. However, AVX(2) and AVX-512 can still give Zen 4 an edge, because wide vector operations do more work with a single micro-op. Intel’s Redwood Cove similarly stands to benefit from wider vectors, though Meteor Lake’s hybrid core setup prevents it from supporting AVX-512. </p>
<p>Oryon’s FP/vector side feels like it’s about as strong as any NEON/ASIMD setup can reasonably be. Without SVE support, Oryon can’t use vectors wider than 128-bits. Supporting FMA ops on all four pipes gives it similar floating point throughput to Zen 4, but and potentially gives Oryon an advantage with code that doesn’t use vectors wider than 128 bits. But feeding that setup requires 12 FP register file ports, because each FMA needs three inputs. Pulling that off with a 416 entry register file sounds expensive.</p>

<p>Oryon has less scheduling capacity for address generation ops compared to math ones, but four 16 entry schedulers are nothing to sneeze at. Together, those schedulers can hold more micro-ops than Firestorm’s AGU scheduling and non-scheduling queues combined. Zen 4 can theoretically keep 72 incomplete address generation operations in flight, but those entries are shared with integer math operations.</p>
<h2>Address Translation</h2>
<p>On any modern CPU, programs operate on virtual addresses that get translated on-the-fly to physical addresses. Address translation caches, called Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs), help accelerate this by caching frequently used translations. Oryon features very large TLBs, helping reduce address translation latency.</p>

<p>Oryon’s first level data TLB has 224 entries and is 7 way set associative, providing 896 KB of coverage with 4K pages. That’s a lot of capacity compared to first level TLBs on AMD and Intel CPUs. It’s reminiscent of Kryo’s 192 entry L1 DTLB, which similarly provided fast address translation coverage over a relatively large address space. And, it’s refreshing to see next to AMD, Intel, and Arm’s small L1 DTLBs.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Level</td><td>Oryon</td><td>Zen 4</td><td>Apple Firestorm</td></tr><tr><td>L1 DTLB</td><td>224 entry 7-way</td><td>72 entry fully associative</td><td>160 entry</td></tr><tr><td>L2 TLB</td><td>8K+ entry 8-way<br>7 cycle latency</td><td>3072 entry 24-way<br>7-8 cycle latency</td><td>3072 entry</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>But unlike Kryo, which dropped L1 TLB misses on the floor, Oryon has a large second level TLB with over 8K entries. Getting a translation from the L2 TLB appears to take 7 extra cycles, which is good especially considering Oryon’s 4 GHz+ clocks and the size of the L2 TLB.</p>

<p>Measurements return confusing results though, showing an increase in address translation penalties past 6 MB. That would correspond to 1536 L2 TLB entries, which is far short of the 12 MB that Zen 4’s L2 TLB would cover. Testing sizes past 128 MB shows another increase, but that doesn’t correspond to 8K entries * 4K pages = 32 MB. </p>
<h2>Cache and Memory Access</h2>
<p>Oryon uses an Apple-like caching strategy. A large 96 KB L1 and relatively fast L2 with 20 cycles of latency together mean Oryon doesn’t need a mid-level cache. Firestorm has a bigger 128 KB L1, but Oryon’s L1 is still much larger than the 32 or 48 KB L1 caches in Zen 4 or Redwood Cove.</p>

<p>AMD has a 1 MB L2 mid-level cache private to each core, then a 16 MB L3. That setup makes it easier to increase caching capacity, because the L2 cache can insulate the core from L3 latency. However, that advantage is minimal for mobile Zen 4 parts, which max out at 16 MB of L3. Oryon therefore provides competitive latency especially as accesses spill out of Zen 4’s L2. Meteor Lake follows a similar caching strategy to Zen 4, but has more caching capacity at the expense of higher latency.</p>

<p>After L2, Oryon has a 6 MB System Level Cache (SLC) with a claimed latency of 26-29 ns. Test sizes between 12 and 18 MB generally align with that. For example, latency at 14 MB was approximately 25 ns using 2 MB pages. Accurately assessing SLC latency is difficult because many accesses within even a 18 MB array will result in L2 hits. The SLC’s low capacity compared to the L2 cache will likely limit its relevance for CPU-side code.</p>
<p>DRAM latency is 110.9 ns with a 1 GB array, which isn’t far off Qualcomm’s claimed 102-104 ns. The Ryzen 7840HS achieves somewhat lower latency at 103.3 ns, likely because it uses DDR5 memory instead of LPDDR5X. Meteor Lake’s memory latency is worse at over 140 ns.</p>
<h3>Bandwidth</h3>
<p>x86 CPUs traditionally had a strong focus on vector execution, and have plenty of cache bandwidth to support their vector units. Oryon competes surprisingly well in this area. There’s no SVE support, but Oryon takes 128-bit vector widths about as far as they’ll reasonably go with support for four 128-bit loads per cycle. That’s a match for Zen 4’s 2×256-bit load bandwidth, though a bit behind Redwood Cove’s 3×256-bit load capability. </p>
<p>Oryon’s large L1 cache capacity should let it hold up well for smaller data footprints, but AMD and Intel’s mid-level caches provide a bandwidth advantage if data spills out of L1. AMD’s L3 also does a good job, providing more bandwidth to a single core than Qualcomm’s L2. Apple’s Firestorm doesn’t emphasize vector workloads and is outpaced by other cores in this comparison.</p>

<p>When reading from DRAM, a single Oryon core can achieve an incredible 80 GB/s of bandwidth. Qualcomm says each core can have over 50 in-flight requests to the system, and a L2 instance can track over 220 memory transactions. Those large queues are likely why a single Oryon core can pull so much bandwidth from DRAM.</p>

<p>Shared caches get put under more pressure under multithreaded loads, as more cores ask for bandwidth. Oryon handles this well, with the L2 providing nearly 330 GB/s of bandwidth to four cores. That’s about 82 GB/s per core, and just a bit lower than the 100 GB/s an Oryon core can get without contention.</p>

<p>Again, AMD and Intel enjoy lots of bandwidth from their core-private L2 caches, and AMD’s L3 continues to shine for larger data footprints. Intel’s Redwood Cove P-Cores have very high cache bandwidth, but that advantage falls off once data spills out into L3.</p>
<p>For all-core workloads, Oryon trades blows with Phoenix depending on which level of the memory hierarchy we hit. L1 cache bandwidth is comparable, with AMD’s eight Zen 4 cores clocking higher to take a slight lead. AMD enjoys about 25% higher L2 bandwidth across all cores. Intel’s Meteor Lake generally has a bandwidth lead thanks to a combination of high core count and Redwood Cove’s 3×256-bit per cycle load capability. However, the lead is less significant when all threads are loaded because of clock speed drops and lower bandwidth E-Cores coming into play.</p>

<p>As test sizes exceed AMD’s L2 capacity, Qualcomm’s three L2 instances can provide 16% more bandwidth than AMD’s L3. Snapdragon X Elite has three 12 MB L2 instances for 36 MB of total capacity. Using three L3 instances makes it easier to provide high bandwidth too.</p>
<p>Finally, Qualcomm has much higher DRAM bandwidth thanks to fast LPDDR5X. With over 110 GB/s of measured read bandwidth, the Snapdragon X Elite is comfortably ahead of both Phoenix and Meteor Lake.</p>
<h2>Cinebench 2024</h2>
<p>Maxon’s Cinebench has been a benchmarking staple for years because it’s able to scale with core count. Modern CPUs have a lot of cores, but delivering high multithreaded performance in a limited power budget is very difficult. Cinebench 2024 has a native ARM64 build, so the Snapdragon X Elite will be free from binary translation penalties.</p>

<p>Qualcomm does very well. SMT helps AMD by giving each Zen 4 core explicit parallelism to work with. However, that’s not enough to counter the Snapdragon X Elite’s higher core count. The Snapdragon X Elite has 12 cores to AMD’s eight, and comes away with a 8.4% performance lead while drawing just 2% more power. From another perspective though, each Zen 4 core punches above its weight. Qualcomm is bringing 50% more cores to the table, and bigger cores too. Snapdragon X Elite should be crushing the competition on paper, but thermal and power restrictions prevent it from pulling away.</p>

<p>Qualcomm’s slides suggest a higher power reference device can indeed achieve such results. Higher core counts need more power and better cooling to shine. We don’t know what clock speeds Qualcomm’s higher power reference device was able to sustain. In the Samsung Book Edge4, the Snapdragon X Elite averaged 2.71 GHz. In the HP ZBook Firefly G10 A, the Ryzen 7840HS averaged 3.75 GHz, explaining how AMD’s able to get so close with fewer cores.</p>
<p>Intel’s Meteor Lake has an even higher core count but fails to impress at similar platform power. It’s only slightly faster than Apple’s M2. In the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED, the Core Ultra 7 155H’s Redwood Cove P-Cores averaged 2.75 GHz. The Crestmont E-Cores averaged 2.33 GHz. One of the six P-Cores and the two LPE-Cores didn’t see significant load during the Cinebench 2024 run.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>Oryon combines design philosophies from both Firestorm and the company’s much older Kryo. The result is a very solid architecture, because Qualcomm took care to bring forward the best of those worlds. Qualcomm has wanted to move beyond smartphones and take a chunk of the laptop market for a long time, and Snapdragon X Elite is the strongest shot the company has taken yet. On paper, 12 big Oryon cores should be a formidable opponent for both AMD’s eight Zen 4 cores and Meteor Lake’s 16 cores of various types.</p>
<p>We’ll leave detailed benchmarking to mainstream tech sites, since they can do so in a more controlled environment and have the budget to provide more comparison points. But at a glance, Snapdragon X Elite provides competitive performance when running native applications. Even with binary translation, Oryon is fast enough to provide usable performance. With that in mind, Oryon has fulfilled two of the conditions that drove Apple Firestorm’s 2020 success.</p>

<p>But Snapdragon X Elite has a steeper hill to climb than Apple’s M1. Where Apple Silicon was the only upgrade option within the Apple ecosystem, PC customers have up-to-date AMD and Intel options to choose from. The PC ecosystem owes its popularity and staying power to a tradition of excellent software compatibility. Oryon relies on binary translation to execute x86 code, which comes with a performance penalty. Compatibility expectations extend to the operating system too. PC users expect to be able to (re)install an operating system of their choice. Generally a stock Linux or Windows image will boot on x86 CPUs going back several generations, regardless of device or motherboard manufacturer. Arm devices suffer from severe platform fragmentation, and Snapdragon X Elite is no exception. OS images have to be customized for each laptop, even ones that use the same Oryon cores.</p>

<p>Finally, Snapdragon X Elite devices are too expensive. Phoenix and Meteor Lake laptops often cost less, even when equipped with more RAM and larger SSDs. Convincing consumers to pay more for lower specifications is already a tough sell. Compatibility issues make it even tougher. Qualcomm needs to work with OEMs to deliver competitive prices. Lower prices will encourage skeptical consumers to try Snapdragon X Elite, getting more devices into circulation. That in turn leads to more developers with ARM64 Windows devices and more ARM64 native applications.</p>
<p>Qualcomm has their work cut out for them. We look forward to their next generation of CPU cores, and hope it’ll be strong enough to keep pace with AMD and Intel’s next generation products.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>From a trash-filled Earth to the futuristic <i>Axiom</i> and back again, <i>WALL·E</i> is a finely crafted balance between consumerist dystopia and sixties space-race optimism. Please join me, then, for a detailed dive&nbsp;into the uniquely robotic future of a remarkably human film, as seen through the eyes of its eponymous hero, WALL·E.</p>

<p><em>[This article is from the&nbsp;</em><a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/book/">Typeset in the Future book</a><i>, which is really very good&nbsp;and you’re&nbsp;probably going to want to&nbsp;</i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1419727141/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=titf0f-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1419727141&amp;linkId=b321076a05a18b3ffdfd5fd8924ad645">buy a copy of</a><i>. If you’d rather read the article first, don’t worry—I’ll remind you again later on.]</i></p>
<p>Before we get started, there is an important detail we must clear up. Our hero’s name is not, as you might think, WALL-E. Moreover, it <i>definitely</i> isn’t WALL•E. His name is <em>WALL·E</em>, and that dot is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct">interpunct</a>, not a hyphen or a bullet.</p>
<figure data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_1492" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1492"><a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_02_37_2_full.jpg"><img src="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_02_37_2.jpg?w=1000" alt="walle_0_02_37_2" srcset="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_02_37_2.jpg 560w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_02_37_2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=62 150w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_02_37_2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=125 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1492">WALL·E’s front plate, clearly showing his interpunct.</figcaption></figure>
<p>An interpunct is, of course, a vertically centered dot originally used to separate words in Latin and ancient Greek. (Spaces weren’t invented until several centuries later.) The interpunct is still in use today—it’s the official decimal point in British currency (£9·99), and is used to represent the dot product of two vectors in mathematics (x · y). Most relevantly, it’s used in Japanese to separate titles, names, and positions, as in “課長補佐 · 鈴木” (Assistant Section Head · Suzuki). It is therefore entirely appropriate as the separator in WALL·E, which is short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter · Earth Class.</p>
<p>The bold extended typeface seen on WALL·E’s front plate is Gunship, designed by Dan Zadorozny, one of the unsung heroes of modern sci-fi type design. Dan is an amateur type designer from Texas whose <a href="http://iconian.com/">Iconian Fonts website</a> features more than six hundred free hand-crafted typefaces, many of which have been used by sci-fi movies, TV shows, and book designers.</p>
<p>In addition to WALL·E’s front plate, Gunship is seen on Earth and aboard the <i>Axiom</i>, the flagship spacecraft of megacorporation Buy n Large (BnL, for short), most notably for robot-facing wall and door typography. Its upper- and lowercase variants include different combinations of cutouts and curve orientations, giving designers flexibility when crafting robot signage. (Strictly speaking, this means that our hero’s name, correctly capitalized, is “waLL·e,” with the interpunct as a further customization—Gunship’s own interpunct is rectangular.)</p>

<p>The movie begins with an insight into WALL·E’s typical workday, which is spent building gigantic piles of trash by compacting waste into neat, stackable cubes. After a hard day’s crushing, we follow him on his journey home, learning some useful exposition along the way. This includes a bank of electronic ads for BnL, promoting everything from liquid air to quadruple-patty burgers. Common throughout these ads is an insistence on immediate consumption—“DRINK NOW,” “HUNGRY NOW,” “RUN NOW,” “CONSUME.” And if consuming a product once isn’t enough, you can repeat the experience a second time—the signage seen below includes ads for both “100% Reused Food” and “Regurgi-Shake: Twice the Flavor.”</p>
<p><a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_04_02_full.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_04_02.jpg?w=1000" alt="walle_0_04_02" srcset="https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_04_02.jpg 560w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_04_02.jpg?w=150&amp;h=62 150w, https://typesetinthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/walle_0_04_02.jpg?w=300&amp;h=125 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px"></a></p>
<p>We’ve seen how corporate mergers, such as <a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/2014/12/01/alien/"><i>Alien</i>’s Weylan Yutani</a> and <a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/2016/06/19/bladerunner/"><i>Blade Runner</i>’s Shimata-Dominguez</a>, are an inevitability in sci-fi futures. <i>WALL·E</i>’s Buy n Large is similar, except that this company was formed by a merger between a frozen yogurt manufacturer (Buy Yogurt) and a maker of suits for the larger gentleman (Large Industries). Clearly a marriage made in heaven, this corporate combination led to a rapid expansion, culminating with Buy n Large owning every company and government in the world.</p>
<p>The Buy n Large logo is an over-italicized customization of Futura Extra Bold Oblique, as demonstrated by a super-distinctive capital G in the BUY N LARGE BANK logotype that WALL·E passes early in the movie.</p>

<p>If the red-and-blue logo feels familiar, it shouldn’t be a surprise—it’s because BnL uses the exact same typeface and color scheme as real-world retail giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costco">Costco Wholesale Corporation</a>.</p>

<p>There’s another curious BnL subsidiary to be found among the city’s electronic ads, on a beaten-up billboard advertising “Eggman Movers (Creating More Space).” This company is an Easter-egg reference to WALL·E production designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Eggleston">Ralph “Eggman” Eggleston</a>, and it shares the name of the moving company from 1995’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story">Toy Story</a></em>, for which Ralph was art director.</p>

<p>The presence of a Buy n Large–branded bank means Buy n Large–branded banknotes, which are unusual for being strewn across the floor of the deserted city. If you look closely at the notes, you’ll see that some of them have “10<sup>6</sup>” in the corner, and are marked “ten million dollars.” Others look to be marked “99<sup>6</sup>,” suggesting that Buy n Large stores continued the classic $9.99 pricing trick even after adding six zeroes to the end of everything. (Indeed, it says much about the Buy n Large approach to consumerism that it prints notes with the 99s already included, to avoid customers having to receive any change.)</p>

<p>We discover later in the movie that the <em>Axiom</em> left Earth in the year 2105. This suggests that in the preceding years of overconsumption there was a period of severe hyperinflation, making a $10 million note a necessity. This is not without historical precedent—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe">Earth’s most extreme example of hyperinflation</a> occurred in Zimbabwe in November 2008, just a few months after <em>WALL·E</em>’s release, when the inflation rate for the Zimbabwe dollar reached a staggering 79,600,000,000 percent per month. At this point, a single US dollar was equivalent to 2,621,984,228 Zimbabwe dollars.&nbsp;The largest-denomination note printed during this time was the $100 trillion note, which makes Buy n Large’s $10 million bill seem like small change by comparison.</p>

<p>Despite their association with aspirational futures, monorails have been failing to become a global mass-transit system for almost two hundred years. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_monorail">The first passenger monorail</a> opened in 1825 in Cheshunt, England, primarily to transport bricks, though it was also utilized for transporting people, mostly for novelty purposes. Unlike the top-of-rail system seen in <em>WALL·E</em>, Cheshunt’s monorail consisted of carriages suspended beneath an overhead track, and was powered by a single horse.</p>
<p>The Cheshunt style of monorail—with suspended carriages hanging beneath a single rail—was also adopted by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuppertal_Suspension_Railway">Wuppertal Schwebebahn</a>, which began operation along the Wupper River in Wuppertal, Germany, in 1901. The Wuppertal’s suspended system is still in operation today, carrying more than sixty-five thousand passengers on an average weekday.</p>

<p>The monorail seen in <em>WALL·E</em> is of the style popularized by Swedish entrepreneur <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Wenner-Gren">Axel Wenner-Gren</a>, whose prototype ALWEG (<strong>A</strong>xel <strong>L</strong>ennart <strong>We</strong>nner-<strong>G</strong>ren) monorail system came to the attention of Walt Disney after a family visit to Wuppertal gave him monorail fever. Disney saw the potential for a monorail attraction at his new Disneyland theme park in California, and the Disneyland-ALWEG Monorail System opened in June 1959. The system remains in operation today (under the name Disneyland Monorail), and there are similar attractions at Disneyland Tokyo and Walt Disney World in Florida. In total, Disney monorails have transported more than one billion passengers into an aspirational transportational future.</p>

<p>It’s not entirely clear what US city WALL·E lives in, but the presence of a monorail network certainly positions it as a location that was once optimistic about the future. This mid-century futurism is borne out by other architectural features of the city, most notably a curved building seen among the billboards encountered earlier. This building is strongly reminiscent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Needle">Space Needle observation tower</a> in Seattle, Washington, which was built for the city’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_21_Exposition">1962 World’s Fair</a>, together with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Center_Monorail">ALWEG monorail system</a> that is still in operation today.</p>

<p>Near the monorail, WALL·E passes a promotional poster for himself, with the caption “Working to dig you out!” This poster has definite communist propaganda undertones, showing a stylized army of WALL·Es working together to build a brighter future. The implication of this design choice—that communist values are the solution to decades of rampant consumerism—is a pretty bold political statement for what is only the fourth minute of the movie.</p>

<p>This aspirational style is an example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_realism">socialist realist design</a>, the officially sanctioned visual aesthetic of the Soviet Union, which positioned broad-shouldered, purposeful workers as the true heroes of the age. As a robot who is literally a rectangle, there is surely no worker more broad-shouldered and purposeful than our movie’s eponymous hero, WALL·E.</p>
<p>WALL·E’s self-promotional poster is also a fine example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handel_Gothic">Handel Gothic</a>, one of the movie’s supporting typefaces. Originally designed in 1965 by Donald J. Handel, the font has become a mainstay of design futurism. (Indeed, it is quite possibly the originator of one of our <a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/2016/02/18/futuristic/">rules for futuristic type</a>: Make straight things curved.)</p>

<p>Handel Gothic enjoyed a particular resurgence when the type family was expanded in the 1980s, and will be immediately familiar to anyone who visited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epcot">EPCOT Center</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World">Walt Disney World</a> in Florida, which opened in 1982. (Later in this article, we’ll look in detail at the theme park, which is now named simply Epcot.) The original EPCOT Center logo was Handel Gothic all the way, making particularly good use of a lowercase n in “Center” to bring some extra curviness, and choosing a font variant with a curved leg in its R for consistency. (It also added <a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/2016/02/18/futuristic/">letter joining and slicing</a> for good futuristic measure.)</p>

<p>The movie that made Handel Gothic synonymous with sci-fi, however, was almost certainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind"><em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em></a>, released in 1977. <em>Close Encounters</em> used the typeface for its theatrical poster and for its opening credits, with the very words “Close Encounters” offering not one but three opportunities to recognize Handel Gothic’s trademark E.</p>

<p>But back to WALL·E’s journey. Toward the end of his trek home, he passes many more WALL·E units, all of them rusted and dead. The sole remaining WALL·E happily cannibalizes a Caterpillar track from a nearby broken unit to replace his own damaged part, and motors onward with the new track in place.</p>
<p>It’s an easy detail to miss, but WALL·E’s home is a broken-down “BnL WALL·E Transport” vehicle, which may once have housed all the dead units he just passed. When he reverses himself into a WALL·E-size bin in a rotatable storage rack a few minutes later and rocks himself to sleep, his loneliness as the last robot on Earth is made all the more acute by the uninhabited bins around him, now filled with ordered trash.</p>

<p>Before he climbs into bed, WALL·E retrieves his favorite VHS cassette from a nearby toaster, and pops it into a VCR. It turns out this is a beaten-up copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello,_Dolly!_(film)"><em>Hello, Dolly!</em></a>—1969’s awkwardly punctuated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Herman">Jerry Herman</a> musical.

<p>WALL·E watches his <em>Hello, Dolly!</em> cassette via a small, portable device that looks almost exactly like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Classic#5th_generation">Apple iPod Video</a>. I say “almost,” because the real-world iPod Video had a smaller click wheel than the one seen in <em>WALL·E</em>, had white labels on its buttons, and did not support external playback from a VHS cassette player. Nonetheless, this iPod is just one example of many in WALL·E’s home that evoke nostalgia for gadgets past, reinforcing that WALL·E himself is the discarded, unwanted technology that humanity left behind.</p>

<p>To work around the tiny scale of his iPod’s screen, WALL·E uses a plastic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_lens">Fresnel lens</a> as a magnifying device to enlarge the image to several times its original size.

<p>WALL·E awakes from robotic sleep on day two of the movie, low on power and dynamism. The fact that his head is a big pair of binoculars gives a great opportunity for a visual gag, as we see him literally bleary-eyed before activating the zoom lock on first his left eye, then his right, to reveal an eye-test chart in the opposing rack.</p>

<p>WALL·E’s binocular form is mimicked in the shape of his heads-up display (or HUD), which has the classic “two circles” shape used in many movies to indicate that we are looking from a character’s viewpoint through a pair of binoculars. This HUD raises an interesting question, however. Why does WALL·E have a heads-up display, with information overlaid on a video stream? A heads-up display really makes sense only if you are a human who has eyes; for a robot, any video input is combined with additional metadata from environmental sensors (such as direction, zoom, and power), and fed directly into the robot’s processor. Overlaying environmental information on a video stream implies that the robot has cameras that look at the world, and then <em>more</em> cameras that look at the augmented output of those cameras, which doesn’t make sense at all.</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is that WALL·E has a HUD because movie robots have HUDs, and movie robots have HUDs because they enable the viewer to visualize what the robots are thinking, even if it makes zero sense in technical reality. This trope began in 1973’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(film)"><em>Westworld</em></a>, whose final act shows us the world from the vantage point of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yul_Brynner">Yul Brynner</a>’s gun-slinging robot. Although Brynner’s HUD is not augmented with data, it is nonetheless <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-michael-crichtons-westworld-pioneered-modern-special-effects">the first use of computer-generated imagery in a feature film</a>. Director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton">Michael Crichton</a> cuts several times from a real-world scene to the robot’s pixelated version of the same, including a thermal image when Brynner chases his prey in the movie’s final act.</p>

<p>Day two (and act two) of <em>WALL·E</em> see a Buy n Large scout ship arrive on Earth, disrupting WALL·E’s routine. Most importantly, it introduces us to EVE, who is everything WALL·E is not. EVE’s shiny white design is technologically advanced; she’s the curvy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G4">iMac G4</a> to WALL·E’s boxy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_128K">Mac 128K</a>. Her design evokes sleek Apple products of the 2000s, with her head, in particular, highly reminiscent of a 2002 iMac G4’s base. Even her reboot sound is a futuristic take on Apple’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/24/jim-reekes-the-apple-sound-designer-who-created-sosumi.html">famous startup chime</a>, whereas WALL·E’s post-charge chime is the version Apple introduced in 1998 and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202768">removed altogether in 2016</a>.</p>

<p>EVE’s evocation of Apple product design is not entirely coincidental. In a <a href="http://fortune.com/2008/05/12/fortune-apples-ive-helped-design-the-heroine-of-pixars-wall-e/">2008 interview with <em>Fortune</em> magazine</a>, director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Stanton">Andrew Stanton</a> stated: “I wanted EVE to be high-end technology—no expense spared—and I wanted it to be seamless and for the technology to be sort of hidden and subcutaneous. The more I started describing it, the more I realized I was pretty much describing the Apple playbook for design.” This led to a 2005 call to Steve Jobs—at that time, both owner of Pixar and CEO of Apple—which in turn led to Apple design head <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jony_Ive">Jony Ive</a> spending a day at the Pixar headquarters in Emeryville, consulting on the EVE prototype. (It is surely entirely coincidental that EVE’s wireless arms and hands are reminiscent of Apple’s wireless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Mouse">Magic Mouse</a>, released the year after <em>WALL·E</em>.)</p>

<p>During a dust storm, WALL·E takes EVE back to the safety of his home, where he presents her with a small multicolored cube.

<p>EVE’s cube-solving time would be impressive for a human; the current world record is 4.22 seconds, <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2018/5/feliks-zemdegs-achieves-fastest-time-to-solve-a-rubiks-cube-in-4-22-seconds-524695">set by Feliks Zemdegs in May 2018</a>. Sadly, because of the camera pan, we’ll never know if EVE broke the world record for a robot, which currently stands at a mind-boggling 0.637 seconds. This record was set in November 2016 by <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2017/3/video-robot-breaks-world-record-solving-rubiks-cube-in-0-637-seconds-464392">Sub1 Reloaded</a>, a cube-solving robot built by German engineer Albert Beer. Six high-performance stepper motors turned the cube twenty-one times to complete the task, averaging just 0.03 seconds per rotation.</p>

<p>Spare a thought, then, for poor WALL·E. His surprise at EVE’s accomplishment is understandable—he lacks color vision and has only three digits on each hand, which means that Rubik’s Cubes are really not his specialty. (There’s a reason Guinness doesn’t have a “fastest dog” <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/search?term=rubik">Rubik’s Cube category</a>.)</p>
<p>One other point of note: This scene is the only time the color green appears in <em>WALL·E</em> in a scene unrelated to a plant. While this breaks the movie’s careful color scripting, it’s worth it for a good gag.</p>
<p>All seems to be going well with WALL·E and EVE’s introductions, until they are rudely interrupted by EVE’s spotting a plant that WALL·E has excavated from the trash. She subsumes the plant, as per her “directive,” and enters hibernation mode. WALL·E’s attempts to wake her invariably end in comedic pain, though one of them does reveal EVE’s serial number, 051682, set in Handel Gothic. (I can’t help but wonder whether someone in Pixar’s art department was born on May 16, 1982.)</p>

<p>WALL·E gives up on reviving EVE and disconsolately returns to his trash-crushing routine. Shortly afterward, the <em>Axiom</em>’s scout ship returns to Earth and collects EVE to take her home. Desperate not to lose his new friend, WALL·E hitches a ride on the outside of the scout, causing him grief when the ship blasts through Earth’s surrounding satellite trash. As the satellites fall away, we see that WALL·E has a Soviet-era <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1">Sputnik 1</a></em> satellite on his head. This is impressive, especially given that <em>Sputnik 1</em>—the first man-made object to orbit Earth—burned up on reentry to Earth’s atmosphere in 1958.</p>

<p>Showing recent space technology as trash or as museum pieces positions our personal experiences of space as archaic and quaint in comparison to the <em>Axiom</em>’s futuristic styling. This further reinforces WALL·E’s own obsolescence as a discarded piece of technology, and sets us up neatly for a transition to the shiny futurism of the <em>Axiom</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Axiom</em> paints a vision of the future where every menial task, no matter how small, has a dedicated robot created expressly for the purpose. Like <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>’s HAL and <em>Alien</em>’s MU/TH/UR, all these robots have cute acronyms to make them human-friendly.</p>

<p>EVE’s acronym, sadly, is even worse. Her denomination as Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator could not be more inaccurate, given that her entire reason for existing is to evaluate vegetation on the planet <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Terra">Terra</a> (as Earth is known in Latin). Presumably, her moniker was chosen for cuteness rather than linguistic accuracy—after all, this movie is about WALL·E and EVE, not WALL·E and TVE.</p>
<p>Also of note is TYP-E, a typingbot who is designed solely to press keys when someone approaches the elevator shaft to the captain’s quarters. TYP-E provides an excuse for one of the movie’s best visual gags—as a robot, he has a keyboard made entirely, of course, from ones and zeroes.</p>

<p>The <em>Axiom</em>’s robots travel around the ship via their own dedicated corridors, separate from the craft’s passenger areas. These passenger areas are split into three classes—economy, coach, and elite—each of which has a distinct architectural style. The classes themselves do not play a functional role in the movie’s plot, but one has to wonder what they mean for the <em>Axiom</em>’s society. Are children born into the classes their ancestors originally purchased, as if into some kind of futuristic caste system? Would the <em>Axiom</em> have its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film)"><em>Titanic</em></a> moment if a passenger from economy bumped hover chairs with someone from elite? One thing’s certain: The styling of each class is extremely useful for helping viewers orient themselves within the ship’s overall structure as the action moves back and forth along its length.</p>
<p>Our introduction to the passenger area starts with the economy deck, which is compact, angular, and concrete in texture and color. Its palette is deliberately sparse, rarely moving outside the Buy n Large blue, red, and white, and making extensive use of the corporation’s Futura Extra Bold Oblique.</p>

<p>The deck’s design is highly reminiscent of the interior of the Contemporary Tower at Walt Disney World <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%27s_Contemporary_Resort">Contemporary Resort</a>, whose A-frame concrete-and-steel structure was so futuristic when it opened in 1971 that it even had a monorail running through the middle. (As anyone who has stayed at the Contemporary can attest, however, its rates can hardly be considered “economy.”)</p>

<p>The coach deck, unlike the economy deck, is curved, eclectic, and spacious, with brightly colored holo-ads scattered everywhere. It mimics Las Vegas’s Strip in gaudiness and style, with artificial neon colors used extensively and every sign encouraging <em>Axiom</em> passengers to spend more money. (How the ship’s financial economy continues to function after a seven-hundred-year flight continues to remain a mystery.)</p>

<p>The ceiling of the coach deck is a gigantic animated screen that can switch between day and night, complete with a BnL-branded sun or moon. The ceiling’s relationship to <em>actual</em> time is somewhat tenuous, as we see when Captain McCrea winds the sky back from 12:30 p.m. to 9:30 a.m. in order to make his morning announcements. In this regard, the ceiling is essentially an amalgam of two Las Vegas landmarks: the painted cloud ceilings of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Forum_Shops_at_Caesars">Forum indoor arcade</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesars_Palace">Caesars Palace</a>, whose lighting <a href="http://www.colorkinetics.com/showcase/installs/Caesars-Palace-Forum-Shops/">ebbs and changes</a> without ever making it nighttime enough for you to want to stop buying things, and the four-block-long overhead screen of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_Street_Experience">Fremont Street Experience</a>—the world’s largest video screen—whose 12.5 million LEDs illuminate Vegas partygoers every night. The result is an entirely fake sky for the <em>Axiom</em>’s population, allowing finely tuned control over their artificial environment.</p>

<p>The coach deck leads to the elite deck, whose styling resembles that of a high-class lido or spa. Despite their very different palettes, the coach and elite decks share a curved, futuristic environmental styling that unifies their overall architecture. <a href="http://www.animationartconservation.com/design-with-a-purpose%2C-an-interview-with-ralph-eggleston.html">According to production designer Ralph Eggleston</a>, the architecture of this shared area is inspired by the work of architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Calatrava">Santiago Calatrava</a>, whose signature curved supports and arches can be seen throughout both decks’ central concourse.</p>

<p>The other main influence for the <em>Axiom</em>’s architecture is the design of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrowland">Tomorrowland</a> area of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland">Disneyland</a>, in California. According to production designer Ralph Eggleston, during the movie’s production <em>WALL·E</em>’s design team visited an exhibition of Tomorrowland concept art and took inspiration from the designs therein.&nbsp;Perhaps the most obvious of these influences is the presence of a PeopleMover transportation system running through the middle of the club and elite decks, in a style very similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PeopleMover">PeopleMover</a> at Tomorrowland. (Do check out DaveLandWeb’s fantastic <a href="https://www.davelandweb.com/peoplemover/">PeopleMover photo page</a> for some great examples of the original in action.)</p>

<p>The evolution of Disney’s PeopleMover concept began with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_New_York_World%27s_Fair">1964–65 New York World’s Fair</a>, for which the Ford Motor Company asked Disney to <a href="https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/67807/#slide=gs-292282">design an attraction</a> to compete with General Motors’ <a href="http://www.nywf64.com/gm06.shtml">Futurama II</a> exhibit. The resulting <a href="https://www.waltdisney.org/blog/beyond-magic-skyway">Magic Skyway</a> gave fairgoers an opportunity to ride in a <a href="https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/361330/">driverless Ford convertible</a>—including the just-launched Ford Mustang—through a diorama that transported them from prehistoric times to a futuristic space city.</p>
<p>Following its success at the World’s Fair, the traction system behind Magic Skyway was adapted into a new feature for Tomorrowland’s 1967 relaunch. The new attraction, known as the WEDway PeopleMover, enabled <strong>W</strong>alter <strong>E</strong>lias <strong>D</strong>isney to follow Axel Lennart Wenner-Gren (of ALWEG monorail fame) in naming a futuristic transportation mechanism with his initials. It also provided an ideal inspiration for the <em>Axiom</em>’s central transport system.</p>
<p>The <em>Axiom</em>’s PeopleMover has much in common with its WEDway counterpart. Both are focused on a main circular loading area in the heart of a central plaza, with a long, straight stretch of track extending away from the loading deck. Both give passengers a tantalizing view of surrounding attractions as they are transported from one area to another. Indeed, I am sure Walt Disney would have been delighted to see his dream of future transportation integrated into the <em>Axiom</em>’s space-age environment, especially given that Disneyland’s PeopleMover was a prototype for Walt’s grander vision of futuristic living. Walt planned to build a larger PeopleMover installation as part of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPCOT_(concept)">Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow</a>, or EPCOT—a new and futuristic city to be created from scratch at his planned Disney World Resort in Florida.</p>
<p>In October 1966, Walt recorded <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/theoriginalepcot/film-transcript">a short film</a> pitching his “Florida Project” to industrialists and legislators, including a detailed description of EPCOT’s transportation system. In this new city, cars and trucks were to be pushed underground, with the community’s twenty thousand residents instead traveling by WEDway and monorail to work, play, and socialize. The concept images below from Walt’s EPCOT film give an idea of just how much imagination the creative brains at WED Enterprises applied, under Walt’s careful guidance, to everyday living challenges.</p>

<p>Tragically, Walt Disney died less than two months after his EPCOT introduction was filmed, passing away before the pitch was screened and before New Tomorrowland opened to the public. His ambitious vision of a prototype community did not become a reality, but its name lives on in the Epcot theme park (formerly “EPCOT Center”) at Walt Disney World in Florida—although the eventual EPCOT park became more of a permanent World’s Fair than a real-life city of the future. The WEDway PeopleMover did not realize its potential, either: The Disneyland attraction closed in 1995, to be replaced by the faster (but short-lived) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Rods">Rocket Rods</a> ride, which itself closed in 2001.</p>
<p>Disneyland park-goers can still see the PeopleMover’s abandoned tracks snaking through Tomorrowland, displaying curved, arched supports that Santiago Calatrava would surely approve of. (Thankfully, a PeopleMover can still be experienced at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Kingdom">Magic Kingdom park</a> at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrowland_Transit_Authority_PeopleMover">Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover</a> continues to provide a leisurely tour of nearby attractions.)</p>

<p>Of course, the PeopleMover also lives on via the <em>Axiom</em>, whose reimagining of the concept is almost a microcosm of Walt’s vision for EPCOT. Aboard the <em>Axiom</em>, it’s a PeopleMover (not a monorail) that fulfills the role of high-speed arterial transport, with individual BnL hover chairs completing the “final mile” of the journey via preset illuminated paths (blue for humans, white for robots, red for stewardbots). It may not match the scale of Disney’s EPCOT dream, but it’s nonetheless fitting that Walt’s vision of a transportational future made the trip into space.</p>

<p>During WALL·E’s tour of the passenger decks, we discover that the <em>Axiom</em>’s computer is voiced by none other than <em>Alien</em>’s Ellen Ripley.

(Weaver also plays a disembodied voice in Andrew Stanton’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finding_Dory"><em>Finding Dory</em></a>, aping her narration of nature documentaries.)</p>

<p><em>Alien</em> and <em>Aliens</em> are not the only sci-fi movies to get a nod from <em>WALL·E</em>. On the <em>Axiom</em> bridge, we meet AUTO, the ship’s autopilot robot. It might be hard to believe just by looking at him, but AUTO is actually an Evil Space-Based Computer. His design is clearly influenced by a certain other ESBC—that central red eye is a direct reference to <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>’s HAL, giving an immediate signal that this robot is not to be trusted.</p>

<p>AUTO’s physical similarity to HAL gives him a practical similarity, too. On the rare occasions we see the world from AUTO’s vantage point, we get an extreme fish-eye view of the surrounding area, just as we did for HAL in <em>2001</em>. WALL·E combines HAL’s fish-eye view with <em>The Terminator</em>’s red HUD hue, making AUTO’s evil intent doubly clear to any discerning fan of sci-fi.</p>

<p>AUTO and HAL belong to a long-standing tradition of sci-fi automata whose glowing red eye(s) give away their evil nature. They really are everywhere in sci-fi movies—from the Model 101 in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator">The Terminator</a></em>, via the replicants in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner">Blade Runner</a></em>, to the evil wriggly thing inserted into Neo’s belly button in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix"><em>The Matrix</em></a>.</p>

<p>That red glow has its benefits, however.

<p>AUTO may look like the movie’s bad guy, but his actions are simply an example of artificial intelligence following its programming too literally. To understand his motives, we must remember that BnL’s original plan was for its star liners to return to Earth as soon as an EVE probe found proof that life was once more sustainable. Five years after their departure, however, BnL autopilots were sent a directive by CEO Shelby Forthright telling them to keep their craft in space indefinitely, because the cleanup process on Earth was not going to succeed. Six hundred and ninety-five years later, with no subsequent instructions to the contrary, AUTO is simply following this command to the letter, blocking any and all attempts to return to Earth.</p>
<p>In this regard, AUTO is eerily similar to <em>2001</em>’s HAL, whose murderous tendencies aboard the <em>Discovery</em> were similarly driven by an inability to reconcile a contradiction in his programming. In the movie’s sequel, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010:_The_Year_We_Make_Contact">2010: The Year We Make Contact</a></em>, we learn that the basic purpose of HAL’s design was “the accurate processing of information without distortion or concealment.” We also discover that HAL was instructed (via Directive NSD 342/23) to lie to Dave and Frank about the real reason for the <em>Discovery</em>’s mission. After lip-reading that they planned to disconnect him, HAL determined that the only logical way for him to both keep processing and avoid lying was for Dave and Frank to die.</p>
<p>AUTO’s own instruction is Directive A113, whose numbering may sound familiar to Pixar fans. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A113">A113</a>” appears in every Pixar film, from a family license plate in <em>Toy Story</em> to an underwater camera model in <em>Finding Nemo</em>. (Indeed, it’s even in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_(2012_film)">Brave</a></em>, where the roman numerals ACXIII appear carved just above the front door of a witch’s hut.) The reason for its repeated inclusion is that room A1-13 was the classroom for the <a href="https://filmvideo.calarts.edu/programs/character-animation">Character Animation Program</a> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_the_Arts">California Institute of the Arts</a>, where Pixar alumni <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lasseter">John Lasseter</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Docter">Pete Docter</a>, and Andrew Stanton studied. (This explains why it’s also the number on the door of Riley’s classroom in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Out_(2015_film)"><em>Inside Out</em></a>, and on the Scaring 101 classroom door in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsters_University"><em>Monsters University</em></a>.) <em>WALL·E</em> may be its highest-profile outing, but it’s there in every Pixar movie if you keep your eyes peeled.</p>

<p>The majority of <em>WALL·E</em>’s robots are voiced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Burtt">Ben Burtt</a>, the Academy Award-winning sound designer and creator of R2D2’s bleeps. AUTO’s voice, however, is provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlainTalk">MacInTalk</a>, a speech synthesis technology <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B-XwPjn9YY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m10s">first used to announce the Apple Macintosh computer in January 1984</a>. (You may also recognize MacInTalk as the lead vocalist on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead">Radiohead</a>’s “Fitter Happier,” from 1997’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK_Computer"><em>OK Computer</em></a> album.)</p>
<p>MacInTalk’s inclusion in <em>WALL·E</em> makes it one of only two Apple voice synthesis technologies to star in a feature film; the other is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri">Siri</a>, who provides the voice for ’Puter, Batman’s high-tech assistant in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lego_Batman_Movie">The LEGO Batman Movie</a></em>.</p>

<p>Despite the technology’s age, I’m happy to report that MacInTalk voices still ship with macOS today. If you’d like to turn your Mac into an Evil Space-Based Computer, simply open the System Preferences application, select Accessibility and then Speech, and enable the “Ralph” system voice.</p>
<p>In addition to AUTO, there are two more nods to <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> in <em>WALL·E</em>, both of which take advantage of preexisting associations for dramatic or comedic effect. The first is WALL·E’s brief escapade in a LifePod, the design of which seems clearly inspired by <em>2001</em>’s EVA pods. That iconic ball-like shape immediately triggers an association with interstellar peril, which WALL·E soon discovers is entirely justified.</p>

<p>Once again, <em>WALL·E</em> is sneakily using prior sci-fi art as a shortcut, re-creating familiar effects so that the <em>Axiom</em>’s quick journey home can be explained without exposition.

<p>As these homages show, <em>WALL·E</em> is not afraid to borrow from its predecessors to gain some free sci-fi association. Indeed, such references are celebrated and elevated, drawing on the production team’s clear fondness for vintage sci-fi to create a movie that is both a love letter to the classics and a worthy addition to the list. <em>WALL·E</em> capitalizes on our existing associations with the future to communicate complex plot points and motives with minimal dialogue and text. It is, to my mind, Pixar’s most realistic vision of an internally consistent world, despite the polar opposites of its Earth- and space-based environments. It’s political and satirical, representing utopia and dystopia with enough humor to poke fun at the downsides of both. In short, <em>WALL·E</em> envisages a future that could so easily be bleak and pessimistic—but is instead inspired by the naïveté of its inhuman heroes to re-create the optimism that took man into space in the first place.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>A global internet sweep that examined the websites and mobile apps of 642 traders has found that <strong>75,7% of them employed at least one dark pattern, and 66,8% of them employed two or more dark patterns</strong>.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>Dark patterns are defined as practices commonly found in online user interfaces and that steer, deceive, coerce, or manipulate consumers into making choices that often are not in their best interests. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>This year’s annual International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN) Sweep took place between January 29 and February 2, 2024. It involved participants, or “sweepers,” from 27 consumer protection enforcement authorities in 26 countries around the world.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>For the first time, the ICPEN sweep was coordinated with the Global Privacy Enforcement Network (GPEN). GPEN is a network of over 80 privacy enforcement authorities, which aims to foster cross-border cooperation across privacy regulators and strengthen personal privacy protections in an increasingly global market. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>The collaboration recognizes the growing intersection between consumer protection and other regulatory spheres. In the case of deceptive design patterns, it was clear to both privacy and consumer protection sweepers that many websites and apps employ techniques that interfere with individuals’ ability to make choices that best protect their consumer or privacy rights.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>Sweepers evaluated the sites and apps based on six indicators identified by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as being characteristic of dark commercial patterns&nbsp;<a href="#_ftn1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></span></span></a>. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>The ICPEN report found that potential <strong>sneaking</strong> practices, such as the inability of the consumer to turn off auto-renewal of subscription service, and <strong>interface interference</strong>, for example making a subscription that is advantageous to the trader more prominent, were encountered especially frequent during the sweep. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>Both ICPEN and GPEN, who are working together to improve consumer and privacy protection for individuals around the world, published reports outlining their findings today. The ICPEN report can be found <a href="https://icpen.org/sites/default/files/2024-07/Public%20Report%20ICPEN%20Dark%20Patterns%20Sweep.pdf">here</a> and GPEN report can be found on their <a href="https://www.privacyenforcement.net/content/2024-gpen-sweep-deceptive-design-patterns">website</a>. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Maintaining a resume is not the most interesting use of time. Naturally, when I needed to bring my own up to date, I decided to spend a great deal more time on it and overengineer the process.</p>
<p>I wanted a bunch of things that didn't necessarily fit together that well:</p>
<ul>
<li>A split between content and presentation, so that I could maintain my resume data separately from how it's rendered and swap out different rendered formats.</li>
<li>Version control. I wanted everything in Git, in text-based formats that I can diff or process with scripts.</li>
<li>Multiple output formats, at least in theory.
<ul>
<li>PDF rendering, since most career sites accept PDF uploads.</li>
<li>The option to publish my resume as a web page in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More visual flair and typesetting control than basic Google Docs-style resume templates. (I know applicant-tracking systems don't see visual flair, but it makes me happy).</li>
<li>Straightforward text embedding in PDFs to ensure those ATSs <em>do</em> see what they need.</li>
<li>Not to use LaTeX. It's been years since I used LaTeX in anger, and I'd prefer to stick with web technologies I know well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's where I ended up. (And <a href="https://ktema.org/Resume-David-Reed.pdf">here's</a> the actual output).</p>
<h2 id="building-a-data-driven-resume">Building a Data-Driven Resume</h2>
<p>I'm only aware of one standard for representing resume data: <a href="https://jsonresume.org/schema/">JSON Resume</a>. I always prefer to use standards where I can, although I'm disappointed there isn't a stronger ecosystem around this one. (And all the more that the major HR applications don't ingest it).</p>
<p>Because I wanted to avoid LaTeX, I decided to try templating my resume data into either Markdown or HTML and CSS and then rendering that content as a PDF. That also gave me the optionality I was looking for on output formats; if I wanted a resume web page, I could just publish the HTML with a different stylesheet.</p>
<p>I already use the static site generator <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a> to build this website. Zola's Tera template engine is very similar to Jinja2, making it comfortable for me, and it's very fast.</p>
<p>The HTML-to-PDF tool space doesn't have a huge number of players in it and most of the players seem to be eccentric in some respect. I've played with this kind of rendering in the past and had some success with <a href="https://weasyprint.org/">Weasyprint</a>, so I brought it back for this effort.</p>
<p>Here's how these components come together into a data-to-PDF pipeline:</p>

<p>Resume data is defined in a <code>resume.yaml</code> file, using the JSON Resume schema. I find it much more pleasant to author YAML than JSON, and Zola supports both formats just fine. Here's the opening of my resume in YAML:</p>
<pre data-lang="yaml"><code data-lang="yaml"><span><span><span>#</span> yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/master/schema.json

</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The comment at the top instructs the YAML language server to use the JSON Resume schema to validate the data, which means I get hints in my editor where I've specified something invalid.</p>
<p>On the Zola side, I need a template. The template defines the structure of my resume - how the data is converted into a readable, formatted, attractive presentation. Here's the opening of the template I developed (note that it uses the Jinja2-like Tera template language):</p>

<p>See the full template on <a href="https://github.com/davidmreed/resume-template/blob/main/templates/resume.html">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Taking my cues from <a href="https://simplecss.org/">Simple.css</a>, which I use for this site, I've prioritized using standard semantic HTML tags and using <a href="https://github.com/davidmreed/resume-template/blob/main/static/resume.css">CSS</a> to style them. </p>
<p>Note the critical Tera template tag at the head of the template:</p>
<pre data-lang="jinja2"><code data-lang="jinja2"><span><span><span>{%</span> <span>set</span> <span>resume</span> <span>=</span> <span>load_data</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>=</span><span>page</span><span>.</span><span>extra</span><span>.</span><span>resume_data</span><span>)</span> <span>%}</span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This loads my resume data from <code>resume.yaml</code> into the variable <code>resume</code>, which the rest of my template then consumes to dynamically render my resume into HTML.</p>
<p>I've also decided to treat most of the resume content, as specified in YAML, as Markdown (<code>| markdown | safe</code>, in Tera). That means I can style my highlights for each position, which I apply to call out metrics and achievements in color.</p>
<p>I use only portions of the JSON Resume schema, and a couple of them I use in a way that's a bit questionable. (The story of standardized schemas, isn't it!) I've used the <code>awards</code> key in a fairly loose, unstructured way. I've also misused the <code>skill.keywords</code> key: when the word <code>"break"</code> is present as a keyword, the template starts a new sub-list of skills. (It doesn't otherwise use keywords for anything).</p>
<p>The last element stitching all of this together is a Markdown content file. Zola needs a content file in order to render the template into a page. In <a href="https://github.com/davidmreed/resume-template/blob/main/content/resume.md">this case</a>, the content file's empty save for metadata in its front matter, which defines the mapping between the data file and the template.</p>
<pre data-lang="toml"><code data-lang="toml"><span><span><span>title</span></span><span>=</span><span><span>"</span>Resume<span>"</span></span>
</span><span><span><span>template</span></span><span>=</span><span><span>"</span>resume.html<span>"</span></span>
</span><span><span>[</span><span><span>extra</span></span><span>]</span>
</span><span><span><span>resume_data</span></span><span>=</span><span><span>"</span>resume.yaml<span>"</span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Because the template accepts the <code>resume_data</code> path as a parameter, I could in fact render multiple resumes by creating multiple <code>.md</code> files with different front matter.</p>
<p>At this point, I can render my resume. Once I have <code>zola</code> and <code>weasyprint</code> installed via my package manager of choice (for more on which see below), I do</p>
<pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span>$</span></span><span> zola build</span>
</span><span><span><span>$</span></span><span> weasyprint public/resume/index.html Resume-David-Reed.pdf</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Voila - a PDF resume, beautifully rendered and ready for upload into an applicant-tracking system that could not care less about how snazzy it is.</p>
<p>That's nowhere near enough overengineering. Let's automate the whole shebang. (Although you can stop here and still have a nice data-driven resume, if automation is not your cup of tea).</p>
<h2 id="local-developer-experience">Local Developer Experience</h2>
<p>I already alluded to tooling setup, which is one of the key aspects of the developer experience I want. I don't want to worry about tools, activating virtual environments, launching a container, or any other fiddling.</p>
<p>I also don't ever want to run commands manually to synchronize some artifact A (here, a PDF) with some other artifact B (here, my data file and template). It should be magical. Magic is what software engineering is all about! Plus, a live preview function make the authoring experience so much better.</p>
<p>I've been exploring NixOS lately, so rather than building a <code>Dockerfile</code>, I set up my local environment using <code>nix-shell</code> and <code>direnv</code> following <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Development_environment_with_nix-shell">these instructions</a>. I created a <a href="https://github.com/davidmreed/resume-template/blob/main/shell.nix"><code>shell.nix</code></a> specifying my dependencies:</p>
<pre data-lang="nix"><code data-lang="nix"><span><span>{</span> <span>pkgs</span> <span>?</span> <span>import</span> <span>&lt;nixpkgs&gt;</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span> <span>}</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>  <span>pkgs</span><span>.</span><span>mkShell</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>nativeBuildInputs</span> <span>=</span> <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>.</span><span>buildPackages</span>; <span>[</span> 
</span><span>      <span>zola</span> <span>just</span> <span>python311Packages</span><span>.</span><span>weasyprint</span> <span>inotify-tools</span> <span>yq</span>
</span><span>    <span>]</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>and a <code>.envrc</code> containing</p>
<pre><code><span>use_nix
</span></code></pre>
<p>Then, after I <code>direnv allow</code>, every time I <code>cd</code> into my <code>resume</code> project, <code>weasyprint</code> and <code>zola</code> are magically available for me to use. (See the link above for full setup details).</p>
<p>I don't like memorizing commands, either, so I threw in a <a href="https://github.com/casey/just"><code>justfile</code></a> with some useful abstractions:</p>
<pre data-lang="make"><code data-lang="make"><span><span>filename</span> <span>:=</span></span> <span><span><span>"resume.yaml"</span></span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span><span>build</span></span><span>:</span>
<span></span><span></span></span><span><span></span><span>  <span><span><span>zola</span></span><span> build</span></span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span></span><span><span>pdf</span></span><span>:</span> <span><span>build</span></span><span>
</span></span><span><span></span><span>  <span><span><span>weasyprint</span></span><span> public/resume/index.html <span>\
</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>    Resume-<span><span>$(</span>cat resume.yaml | yq -r '.basics.name | split(" "<span>)</span></span></span> <span>|</span> <span><span>join</span></span><span>(<span><span>"</span>-<span>"</span></span></span><span></span>)<span><span><span><span>'</span>).pdf</span></span></span></span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span></span><span><span>render</span></span><span>:</span> <span><span>build pdf</span></span><span>
</span></span><span><span></span><span>  <span><span><span>xdg-open</span></span><span> Resume-<span><span>$(</span>cat resume.yaml | yq -r '.basics.name | split(" "<span>)</span></span></span> <span>|</span> <span><span>join</span></span><span>(<span><span>"</span>-<span>"</span></span></span><span></span>)<span><span><span><span>'</span>).pdf &amp;disown</span></span></span></span>
</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Here I use <code>yq</code> to dynamically generate the filename of my output PDF from the resume data, which mostly just means I don't hard-code my own name.</p>
<p>Now a <code>just pdf</code> creates my resume PDF, and a <code>just render</code> builds and opens the PDF in my preferred viewer. With a little more shell magic, I can add live previews:</p>
<pre data-lang="make"><code data-lang="make"><span><span><span>watch</span></span><span>:</span>
<span></span><span></span></span><span><span>  <span><span>#</span>!/usr/bin/env sh
</span></span></span><span><span></span><span>  <span><span><span>inotifywait</span></span><span><span><span> -</span>m</span><span><span> -</span>r</span> . <span>\
</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>    --</span>exclude</span> <span><span>"</span>(.*<span>\\</span>.pdf$)|public|justfile|<span>\\</span>.git<span>"</span></span> <span>\
</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>    -</span>e</span> close_write,move,create,delete <span>\
</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span></span>    <span>|</span> <span>while</span> <span><span>read</span></span><span> <span><span>-</span>r</span> directory events filename</span><span>;</span> <span>do</span></span>
</span></span><span><span>      <span><span><span>just</span></span><span> render</span></span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span><span>done</span></span>
</span></span></code></pre>
<p>I derived most of this from a great <a href="https://superuser.com/a/181543">Stack Exchange answer</a>. </p>
<p>Now my workflow goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I run <code>just watch</code>. The script watches the local directory for changes.</li>
<li>I edit my resume data.</li>
<li><code>inotifywait</code> catches the event and runs <code>just render</code>.</li>
<li>Zola and Weasyprint run a rebuild of my resume PDF.</li>
<li>My PDF viewer refreshes with the new content.</li>
<li>When I'm done, I hit <code>Ctrl-C</code> or kill my terminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>A full rebuild takes about a second on my machine, roughly nine tenths of which is PDF rendering time. I'd love that to be faster (the Zola HTML generation takes milliseconds!) but it works for now.</p>
<p>So that's my local development story more or less sorted out. I'm relying on my editor's support for the YAML Language Server (available in Visual Studio Code and in Vim/Neovim) to provide validation and formatting of my YAML. I haven't configured precommit checks of my YAML as I don't know of an appropriate tool that uses the same YAML library as the language server.</p>
<h2 id="continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</h2>
<p>Because my PDF is fundamentally a build product, I don't want to commit it to source control. I also don't want to be responsible for ensuring that a stored copy is up-to-date with my latest commit. Enter GitHub Actions.</p>
<p>I added <a href="https://github.com/davidmreed/resume-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/render.yaml">this workflow</a> to my repo:</p>
<pre data-lang="yaml"><code data-lang="yaml"><span><span><span>name</span></span><span>:</span> <span><span>"</span>Render Resume<span>"</span></span>
</span><span><span>on</span><span>:</span>

</span><span>  <span><span>render</span></span><span>:</span>
</span><span>    <span><span>runs-on</span></span><span>:</span> <span>ubuntu-latest</span>
</span><span>    <span><span>steps</span></span><span>:</span>
</span><span>    <span>-</span> <span><span>uses</span></span><span>:</span> <span>actions/checkout@v3</span>
</span><span>    <span>-</span> <span><span>uses</span></span><span>:</span> <span>cachix/install-nix-action@v23</span>
</span><span>      <span><span>with</span></span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span><span>nix_path</span></span><span>:</span> <span>nixpkgs=channel:nixos-unstable</span>
</span><span>    <span>-</span> <span><span>uses</span></span><span>:</span> <span>DeterminateSystems/magic-nix-cache-action@v2</span>
</span><span>    <span>-</span> <span><span>run</span></span><span>:</span> <span>nix-shell --run "just pdf"</span>
</span><span>    <span>-</span> <span><span>uses</span></span><span>:</span> <span>actions/upload-artifact@v3</span>
</span><span>      <span><span>with</span></span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span><span>path</span></span><span>:</span> <span><span>"</span>*.pdf<span>"</span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Because <code>nix-shell</code> grabs my <code>shell.nix</code> by default, I get the same packages installed in CI that I use for local development. I could go further and pin a specific set of package versions to guarantee reproducibility. I've chosen not to do any pinning yet while I keep rolling out uses for Nix on my local machines.</p>
<p>Once the PDF is rendered, I upload it as an artifact on this commit, so that it's associated with all of its sources. I can grab the PDF from my latest commit and upload it any time I submit a job application.</p>
<p>If I wanted to use another distribution strategy, like including this PDF as an asset in my website, I could build further automation around that use case. That might be programmatically making a commit to a different repo, using my resume repo as a submodule, or something else entirely.</p>
<p>I could go further still and add rendering on branches, too. I might let a branch represent a sector to which I want to apply, like <code>nonprofit</code>. Then I can segregate tailorings of my resume for specific job roles, and merge down global changes from <code>main</code> to keep everything in sync.</p>
<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>
<p>It's still just a resume, but it makes my engineer brain happy.</p>
<p>If you'd like to indulge similar neuroses, you can clone a <a href="https://github.com/davidmreed/resume-template">template repository</a> and start from there.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

            <guid>40934495</guid>
            <pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2024 07:44:29 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2024/2fa-sms">https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2024/2fa-sms</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40934495">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>One-time passwords are often sent via SMS. Security researchers from the CCC recently had live access to over 200 million such SMS messages from more than 200 affected companies.</p><div><blockquote><strong>WhatsApp code: 2342</strong><br>You can also tap on this link to verify your phone:<br>v.whatsapp.com/2342<br>Do not share this code.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Transfer to DE63 4306 0967 1239 7690 03</strong><br>Amount: 1,312.00 EUR<br>TAN: 161161<br>Please enter this TAN to complete the transaction.<br>This TAN is valid for 5 minutes.</blockquote>
<h3>Why SMS?</h3>
<p>Two-factor authentication via SMS (2FA-SMS) is a method to increase the security of authentications. Alongside the static password, a dynamic code sent via SMS is required. The user must enter this code during login to prove they know the password (1st factor: knowledge) and have access to the phone number (2nd factor: possession). Thus, a stolen password alone is not enough to take over the user's account.</p>
<h3>Well-Known Attack Vectors</h3>
<p>This method has been under attack for some time. Through techniques like SIM swapping or exploiting SS7 vulnerabilities in mobile networks, attackers can intercept SMS messages. Alternatively, users can be tricked through phishing attacks into revealing their one-time passwords. <a href="https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2013/de-mail-unqualifizierte-makulatur">The CCC advised against using SMS as a second factor as early as 2013</a>. Nonetheless, 2FA-SMS is widespread. It offers more security than simple password authentication.</p>
<h3>Now Also Viewable Online!</h3>
<p>The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) now demonstrates a previously neglected attack on 2FA-SMS: Service providers are commonly used to send these messages. These providers send large volumes of SMS for various companies and services and have access to the SMS content. Thus, the security of the authentication process also depends on the security of these providers.</p>
<p>IdentifyMobile, a provider of 2FA-SMS, shared the sent one-time passwords in real-time on the internet. The CCC happened to be in the right place at the right time and accessed the data. It was sufficient to guess the subdomain "idmdatastore". Besides SMS content, recipients' phone numbers, sender names, and sometimes other account information were visible.</p>
<h3>Nearly 200 Million SMS from Over 200 Companies</h3>
<p>Over 200 companies that entrusted this provider directly or indirectly through other service providers with the security of their authentication were affected. This included companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, as well as Telegram, Airbnb, FedEx, and DHL. Over 198 million SMS leaked in total.</p>
<p>By simply viewing the live feed, it would have been possible to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take over WhatsApp numbers</li>
<li>Conduct financial transactions or log in to various services without access to the phone, provided the password was known</li>
</ul>
<h3>(Not Yet) a Catastrophe</h3>
<p>To truly misuse the SMS codes, attackers would typically still need the password. However, "1-click login" links were also included in the data. For some large affected companies, only individual services were protected by IdentifyMobile. Nevertheless, IdentifyMobile's negligence exposed companies and their customers to significant risk. This is evident from the numerous similar inquiries from data protection departments worldwide now reaching us through all channels.</p>
<p>We are happy to confirm that we did not keep the data. However, we cannot rule out that others may have accessed it.</p>
<h3>2FA-SMS is Better Than Nothing, But Other Methods Don’t rely on IdentifyMobile</h3>
<p>One-time passwords generated in an app or using hardware tokens are more secure and independent of the mobile network. If this option is available, we recommend using it. And any second factor remains better than just one, the password.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Records in the sub ledger will have much more granular data then the general ledger, like who the specific customer is, specific line items in an order, etc. The difference in data between the sub-ledger and GL will depend on the type of business and volume of data you are working with.

Note that this definition is somewhat ambiguous by design, as different businesses have different materiality thresholds.

This statement is a little broad and up to some interpretation so I will give some real examples.</p><p>If we sell a 10 units of a product that costs $9.99, the corresponding financial records must add up to $99.90. This seems obvious but when you are aggregating thousands (in a lot of cases millions) of transactions, simple summation or rounding errors between systems can cause material inaccuracies. </p><blockquote><p><strong>Wasteman’s Note: </strong><em>People say naming is the hardest problem in computer science, I would say a close second is addition. After working on large scale financial systems for the past few years, I can’t remember how many times the smallest bugs caused large discrepancies in our data. Also don’t get me started on summations over floats. I learned the hard way why you should always use integers.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>The financial record also needs to be </span><strong>complete</strong><span>. More specifically, both the sub-ledger and the general ledger are a complete representation of all business activities that occurred. If there is an event that occurred but is not in the financial record, than the system is not complete. </span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Wasteman’s Note: </strong><em>Another surprisingly really hard problem is guaranteeing completeness. As your system scales, data hops between many systems and at each hop data can easily be mutated or dropped by accident.</em><span> </span></p></blockquote><p>Very related to accuracy, your financial record must be easily auditable so that stakeholders can detect errors and accurately measure performance of your business. And even if you don’t care, the IRS definitely does. </p><p>This one depends entirely on your business and it's specific needs. Small businesses can get away with just dumping all numbers near the end of the month, just in time to close the books. Larger businesses generally want to avoid this, and have a near real time system. This allows them to monitor financials within the month, make decisions based on financial data faster, and reduce the rush to close the month/quarter in the first few days of the month.</p><p><span>But whatever that need is, our accounting system should meet the needs of your business, and whatever </span><strong>timely</strong><span> means to them.</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Wasteman’s note: </strong><em><span>People tend to get lost in conversations about batch vs streaming systems with respect to timeliness a lot. My take is that this isn’t an important distinction to make. </span><a href="https://www.ververica.com/blog/batch-is-a-special-case-of-streaming" rel="">Batch is just a special case of streaming</a><span>. If you’re data is modeled correctly, its pretty easy to switch between them especially with unified frameworks like </span><a href="https://beam.apache.org/" rel="">Apache Beam</a><span>.</span></em></p></blockquote><p>The three main engineering principles your accounting system should abide by are</p><ol><li><p>Immutability and Durability of data</p></li><li><p>Data should be represented at the smallest grain</p></li><li><p>Code should be Idempotent</p></li></ol><p>This allows for auditability, which helps debugging and in turn accuracy. When data is immutable, you have a record of what the state of the system was at any given time. This makes it really easy to recompute the world from previous states, because no state is every lost.</p><p>Building on, once data is stated in the financial record it cannot be deleted. Any corrections to the system must be represented as a new financial transaction. For example let’s say your system had a bug and accidentally reported that a service was sold for $1000, when it should have been $900. To correct this mistake, you should first reverse the accounting entries corresponding to the mistake, and restate the accounting entry for the correct amount. </p><p>It will look something like this: </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png" width="1456" height="1237" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1237,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:87028,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcac99f71-fe2f-41b1-934e-6064f3ffb813_2336x1984.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>So you can see that in the financial record, there is evidence that the balance of Accounts Receivable (AR) and Revenue was $1000 at some point, but was corrected later. Even though that balance was incorrect, we want an audit trail of what the balance was at any given moment.</p><p>Similar to the above principle, this is also critical for enabling a clear audit trail. Even though financial reports and the general ledger are aggregated, they are computed from more granular events. When the data doesn't make sense, you need the most granular data to debug what might have been the issue. </p><p>Saving data at the lowest granularity also makes it really easy to correct data that is derived from that dataset. If a single immutable dataset is the core source of truth for all views of that data, to correct the view all you need to do is rerun the pipeline that creates that view after fixing your data. </p><p>Similarly when accountants are preparing to close the books, they reconcile account balances with all the transactions that occurred to validate that the books are accurate. When a discrepancy is discovered, you can dig into the exact transaction that might be causing the issue.</p><p>Every financial event can only be processed once, duplicates in the financial record will cause obvious inaccuracies. For that reason, all code that produces financial records should be idempotent.</p><p>Over the years, I have run into quite a few gotchas that have caused me a lot of pain. Below are best practices I recommend, to avoid the many pitfalls I have personally faced.</p><p><strong>Use integers to represent financial amounts</strong><span>. Makes arithmetic much easier. Avoid floats at all costs.</span></p><p><strong>Granularity of your financial amounts should support currency conversions with minimal loss of precision</strong><span>. If you are only working with dollars, representing values in cents might be sufficient. If you are a global business, prefer micros or a </span><code>DECIMAL(19, 4)</code><span>.  The decimal choice is quite popular among financial systems, but micros has been the standard for ads financial systems. This limits loss of precision when converting between currencies</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Wasteman’s note: </strong><em>Micros of a currency = smallest unit * 1,000,000. E.g $1.23 = 1,230,000 micros. I first came across this when working with Google’s metrics API.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Use consistent rounding methodologies</strong><span>. At scale the way you round can create material differences between expected amounts. For example one rounding methodology is to round all values 5 and up to the next significant digit, and 4 and below rounds down. Another valid way is to always round up. All that matters is you are consistent across the board. When you are dealing with millions of transactions, being off by 1 cent per transaction can lead to material differences. (10 million transactions off by 1 cent, leads to a difference of $100k). This may not be material to your business at this scale, but it’s material enough for the government to come after you for underpaying taxes.</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Wasteman’s note: </strong><em>If you are a global business there can be a lot of gotchas with rounding and currency conversions. I would go as far as saying you should make a centralized library/service to handle both rounding and currency conversions. Different governments respect different rounding rules when calculating taxes, so having all these nuances abstracted into a single service will reduce complexity.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Delay currency conversion as long as you can</strong><span>. Preemptively converting currencies can cause loss of precision. Delay currency conversions until after aggregations occur in their local currency.</span></p><p><strong>Use integer representations of time</strong><span>. This one is a little controversial but I stand by it. There are so many libraries in different technologies that parse timestamps into objects, and they all do them differently. Avoid this headache and just use integers. Unix timestamp, or even integer based UTC datetimes work perfectly fine. The less data conversions that occur between systems, the better. (Read about Etsy’s own problems with timestamp types </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/codeascraft/the-problem-with-timeseries-data-in-machine-learning-feature-systems" rel="">here</a><span>)</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Wasteman’s note: </strong><em>I haven’t even talked about daylight savings related bugs. Using an incrementing integer can help you avoid this altogether. If you really insist on using datetimestamps, please at least use UTC. You would be surprised at how many very large businesses use non UTC timestamps.</em></p></blockquote><p>Thanks for reading this post, I am sure I made a controversial statement somewhere but please feel free to comment and start a discussion.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="readme">
			
				<h2 id="user-content-dut-a-disk-usage-calculator-for-linux" dir="auto">dut - A disk usage calculator for Linux</h2>
<h2 id="user-content-features" dir="auto">Features</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Accurate counting of hard links with an output inspired by NCDU.</li>
<li>Pure ASCII output which is fully compatible with the plain Linux tty.</li>
<li>Configurable output format. Changing the maximum depth of files shown is a simple command-line
argument.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-content-examples" dir="auto">Examples</h2>
<p dir="auto">By default, <code>dut</code> will output a tree of the biggest directories it finds under your current directory.</p>
<pre><code>$ dut -n 10
 2.4G    0B       /- Local
 2.4G    0B     /- AppData
 2.4G    0B   /- NetworkService
 2.4G    0B |- ServiceProfiles
 2.5G   63M |- servicing
 5.2G  423M |   /- FileRepository
 5.2G  426M | /- DriverStore
 9.6G  2.5G |- System32
  12G  7.2G /- WinSxS
  29G  225M .
</code></pre><p dir="auto">The <code>-n 10</code> option limits it to 10 rows. To limit the depth shown, use <code>-d &lt;n&gt;</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ dut -n 10 -d 1
 964M    0B |- MEMORY.DMP
1010M    0B |- SoftwareDistribution
 1.2G  1.0G |- SysWOW64
 1.3G  208M |- assembly
 1.8G  1.8G |- SystemApps
 2.4G    0B |- ServiceProfiles
 2.5G   63M |- servicing
 9.6G  2.5G |- System32
  12G  7.2G /- WinSxS
  29G  225M .
</code></pre><p dir="auto">The first column in the output tells you how much space a given entry takes up on your disk.
This can be an overcount, however, because of hard links (identical files that are only stored
once on the disk). Hard links under a directory are deduplicated in the first column's number,
but hard links that go outside of a directory to somewhere else will still be counted here.</p>
<p dir="auto">That's where the second column comes in. It tells you how much of an entry's size is shared
with other entries outside of it because of hard links. In the output above, we can see that
most of the entries have a lot of data shared with other entries, but the root directory only
has 225M shared with others. This tells us that there's a lot of hard links going between all
of the entries shown above.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to see how much of an entry's size is unique to just it, you can subtract the second
column from the first one.</p>
<p dir="auto">The full list of options can be seen with <code>dut -h</code>.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-how-to-build" dir="auto">How to build</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>dut</code> is a single source file, so all you need is a C11 compiler:</p>
<pre><code>gcc -O3 -flto main.c -o dut
</code></pre><p dir="auto">To install, copy the <code>dut</code> executable to a directory on your PATH, e.g. <code>/usr/local/bin</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If get linker errors about missing symbols, you may need to add the <code>-pthread</code> option to gcc.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-benchmarks" dir="auto">Benchmarks</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>dut</code> is remarkably fast, but it doesn't win in all cases. It loses to a couple programs when
Linux's disk caches aren't populated yet, which is usually the first time you run it on a certain
directory. On subsequent runs, <code>dut</code> beats everything else by a significant margin.</p>
<p dir="auto">Benchmarked programs:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>du</code> from <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html" rel="nofollow">coreutils</a> (C)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/byron/dua-cli" rel="nofollow"><code>dua</code></a> (Rust)</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/dundee/gdu" rel="nofollow"><code>gdu</code></a> (Go)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If you know of a faster program, let me know and I'll add it to these benchmarks.</p>

added a 10 second sleep between each program's run to limit the effects of thermal throttling.</p>

</code></pre><h4 id="user-content-why-are-pdu-and-dust-so-bad-on-hdd" dir="auto">Why are <code>pdu</code> and <code>dust</code> so bad on HDD?</h4>
<p dir="auto">It's hard to say. My best guess is they have a really HDD-unfriendly access pattern, since they
both use Rayon for multithreading which uses FIFO ordering for tasks. This results in them doing
a breadth-first search of the filesystem, whereas <code>dut</code> and <code>du</code> both use depth-first search. I
don't know why one ordering is better than the other, but the difference is pretty drastic.</p>
<p dir="auto">I also think that ordering is the reason <code>dut</code> doesn't do so well on SSD either, but I'm not so
sure of that.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>In this paper, we study the highly competitive arena of baby naming. Through making several Extremely Reasonable Assumptions (namely, that parents are myopic, perfectly knowledgeable agents who pick a name based solely on its uniquness), we create a model which is not only tractable and clean, but also perfectly captures the real world. We then extend our investigation with numerical experiments, as well as analysis of large language model tools. We conclude by discussing avenues for future research.

<p>Northwestern Medicine and Brigham and Women’s Hospital scientists have discovered a molecular defect that promotes the pathologic immune response in systemic lupus erythematosus (known as lupus) and in a study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07627-2">published</a> in <em>Nature</em>, show that reversing this defect may potentially reverse the disease.</p>



<p>Lupus affects more than 1.5 million people in the U.S. Until this new study, the causes of this disease were unclear. Lupus can result in life-threatening damage to multiple organs including the kidneys, brain and heart. Existing treatments often fail to control the disease, the study authors said, and have unintended side effects of reducing the immune system’s ability to fight infections.</p>



<p>“Up until this point, all therapy for lupus is a blunt instrument. It’s broad immunosuppression,” said co-corresponding author <a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=33689">Jaehyuk Choi, MD, PhD</a>, the Jack W. Graffin Professor, an associate professor of <a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/sites/dermatology/index.html">Dermatology</a> and a Northwestern Medicine dermatologist. “By identifying a cause for this disease, we have found a potential cure that will not have the side effects of current therapies.”</p>



<p>“We’ve identified a fundamental imbalance in the immune responses that patients with lupus make, and we’ve defined specific mediators that can correct this imbalance to dampen the pathologic autoimmune response,” said co-corresponding author Deepak Rao, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a rheumatologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and co-director of its Center for Cellular Profiling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the study, the scientists reported a new pathway that drives disease in lupus. There are disease-associated changes in multiple molecules in the blood of patients with lupus. Ultimately, these changes lead to insufficient activation of a pathway controlled by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which regulates cells’ response to environmental pollutants, bacteria or metabolites. Insufficient activation of AHR results in too many disease-promoting immune cells, called the T peripheral helper cells, that promote the production of disease-causing autoantibodies.</p>



<p>To show this discovery can be leveraged for treatments, the investigators returned the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-activating molecules to blood samples from lupus patients. This seemed to reprogram these lupus-causing cells into a cell called a Th22 cell that may promote wound healing from the damage caused by this autoimmune disease.</p>



<p>“We found that if we either activate the AHR pathway with small molecule activators or limit the pathologically excessive interferon in the blood, we can reduce the number of these disease-causing cells,” said Choi, who is also a member of the <a href="https://www.cancer.northwestern.edu/">Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>. “If these effects are durable, this may be a potential cure.”</p>



<p>Choi, Rao and colleagues next want to expand their efforts into developing novel treatments for lupus patients. They are now working to find ways to deliver these molecules safely and effectively to people.</p>



<p>Other Northwestern authors are first author Calvin Law; Arundhati Pillai; Brandon Hancock; and <a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=41989">Judd Hultquist, PhD</a>, assistant professor of <a href="https://www.medicine.northwestern.edu/">Medicine</a> in the Division of <a href="https://www.medicine.northwestern.edu/divisions/infectious-diseases/index.html">Infectious Diseases</a>. Brigham and Women’s Hospital authors include Vanessa Sue Wacleche, PhD; Ye Cao, PhD; John Sowerby, PhD; Alice Horisberger, MD; Sabrina Bracero; Ifeoluwakiisi Adejoorin; Eilish Dillon; Daimon Simmons, MD; Elena Massarotti, MD; Karen Costenbader, MD, MPH; Michael Brenner, PhD; and James Lederer, PhD.</p>



<p>The research was supported by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases&nbsp;grants K08 AR072791, P30 AR070253, R01 AR078769 and P30 AR075049; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases grants R01 AI176599, P30 AI117943, R01 AI165236 and U54 AI170792; National Cancer Institute grants F31 CA268839 and CA060553, all of the National Institutes of Health (NIH); and NIH Director’s New Innovator Grant 1DP2AI136599-01, and grants from Lupus Research Alliance, Burroughs Wellcome Fund, Bakewell Foundation, Leukemia and Lymphoma Society and American Cancer Society.</p>

The silence is broken by the sound of metal upon metal as a mailbox is opened and closed. Suddenly, a loud scream rends the air. It is followed by a deep, full-throated sobbing and the soft, raspy sound of paper being shredded.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Someone somewhere has just read a review of her novel in the <em>New York Times</em> <em>Book Review</em>, and it is devastating. Someone somewhere now lies splayed in a fuzzy yellow bathrobe and pink bunny slippers, her left cheek imprinted by the grimy pavement while her right hand pounds desperately at the box, as if the action might reverse time itself. Her roommate, following the sound of her cries, has found her and is trying to get her up. The writer’s left hand clutches the now tattered remains of the review; the name “Michiko Kakutani” appears in the byline. A few phrases and words can be seen here and there: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/13/books/13kakutani.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lot of pompous hot air</a>,” “<a href="https://slate.com/culture/2017/07/how-franzen-mailer-and-other-authors-responded-to-michiko-kakutani-s-reviews.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a definite dead end</a>.” Slowly, the two make their way back to their house, the writer still sobbing, her roommate gently holding her up.</p>

<p>Michiko Kakutani’s <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/07/michiko-kakutani-leaving-the-new-york-times" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2017 departure</a> as the chief book critic at the <em>New York Times</em> was greeted with bombastic reverence: <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/07/michiko-kakutani-leaving-the-new-york-times" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Vanity Fair</em></a> declared that she had been “the most powerful book critic in the English-speaking world.” The <em>New Yorker</em>’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/farewell-michiko-kakutani">Alexandra Schwartz</a> wrote that “her assessments of novels and memoirs, works of history, biography, politics, and poetry have guided generations of American readers.” The <a href="https://authorsguild.org/news/legendary-book-critic-michiko-kakutani-steps-new-york-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Authors Guild </a>declared that she had been the rare critic whose reviews could “make or break a book.” And the <em>Times</em>, no doubt keen to inflate its own importance, declared her “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/business/media/michiko-kakutani-times-book-critic-steps-down.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feared and revered</a>” and noted that her departure—“<a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/michiko-kakutani-steps-down-as-chief-book-critic-parul-sehgal-named-book-critic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the changing of the guard among critics</a>” at the paper—was a “<a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/michiko-kakutani-steps-down-as-chief-book-critic-parul-sehgal-named-book-critic/">seismic change</a>.”</p>

<p>Much of this, like the anecdote above, is an exaggeration. Still, Kakutani’s reputation helped solidify the <em>Times’</em>s<em> Book Review</em> and its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Sellers List</a> (which appears in the print version of the <em>Review</em>) as arbiters of taste and quality. This is an entirely undeserved reputation: while Kakutani’s reviews were occasionally, ah, bracing, she often seemed more focused on showing off her dexterity at snideness than reviewing books, sometimes adopting <a href="https://live-legacy-admin.nypl.org/blog/2017/07/31/many-voices-michiko-kakutani?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the voice of a literary character</a> from a different book than the one she was reviewing: Holly Golightly in a review of Truman Capote’s <em>Summer Crossing</em> or Holden Caulfield when reviewing Benjamin Kunkel’s <em>Indecision</em>. (The results were embarrassing.) In recent years, the <em>Book Review</em> has become so anodyne, its reviewers so reluctant to express opinions that even Kakutani’s reviews might now prove a welcome distraction. As for any influence: A 2004 <a href="https://users.ssc.wisc.edu/~sorensen/papers/bookreviews.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> of the impact of the <em>Review</em> on sales by Alan T. Sorensen and Scott J. Rasmussen found that while positive reviews increase sales, even negative reviews can positively impact sales. But the media landscape has since changed vastly. More recently, in 2023, the publicist <a href="https://kathleenschmidt.substack.com/p/book-publicity-what-works-and-what" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kathleen Schmidt </a>opined that “media consumption has changed so much that big publicity isn’t necessarily effective” and that while “many authors dream of being reviewed in <em>The New York Times</em>, […] a review there rarely sells many copies of a book.” In a 2022 essay in <em>The Nation, </em><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/new-york-times-book-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kyle Paoletta</a> writes about the <em>Review</em> having “less influence than it once had.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>And yet, the <em>Book Review</em>, which has been around <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/insider/book-review-history.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since 1896</a> (the <em>Times</em> was founded in <a href="https://www.nytco.com/company/history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1851</a>),<span><sup>1</sup></span>&nbsp;remains influential, like the dying embers at the center of a slowly ebbing fire, and it continues to exercise its insidious influence upon the public, many readers, and book editors who are looking for examples of what the <em>Review</em> considers “good” or “great” books. Among the many ill effects: the <em>Book Review</em> tokenizes non-white writers in essentialist ways, reducing them to mere standard-bearers of their perceived cultures, and this attitude is too often replicated by even the most seemingly edgy review publications. Its emphasis on the Big Five publishers and book sales has meant that writers likely feel compelled to write towards what they imagine a <em>Book Review</em> critic might want to see. Despite all these issues, and its declining reputation notwithstanding, the <em>Book Review</em> has so long been imitated that its worst characteristics have seeped into that amorphous realm we might term “book culture”—a world where unspoken traditions about how to read and whom to read and why have taken hold and authors are compelled to write in ways that conform to gendered and racialized expectations or the apparently unrelenting public desire for more trauma memoirs.</p>

<p>By reinforcing in its content the worst trends in publishing, the <em>Book Review </em>ultimately perpetuates the material inequality so prevalent in the publishing world. Publishing is massively profitable—but <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/71505-how-much-top-publishing-executives-earn.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only for top executives at a few places</a>: their salaries can run in the millions. For positions lower on the hierarchy, the average salary (some hiked by unionization at places like HarperCollins) <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/92099-starting-salaries-at-big-publishers-grow.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generally starts around $48,000</a>, which is a dismal salary for someone living in a city like New York, where most publishing houses are based. In fact, the book industry is increasingly skewed to include only those who can work for free in unpaid internships or for meager salaries supplemented by family or spousal wealth. In turn, these up-and-coming editors and agents tend to seek writing from those in their own spheres of influence which means that, more and more, fiction and nonfiction work only echo worldviews of a very particular set of people (in mainstream publishing, this means a very liberal mindset rather than any kind of truly left perspective, with rare exceptions). While many have criticized the <em>Book Review</em> on grounds that it is boring and perhaps simply irrelevant, few have considered the long-lasting economic effects of its moribund style.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kakutani’s reputation was built on a 38-year career at the 173-year-old <em>Times</em>, which she <a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/michiko-kakutani-steps-down-as-chief-book-critic-parul-sehgal-named-book-critic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined as a reporter in 1979</a> before becoming a book critic in 1983. Since then, the book review world has changed drastically, with fewer publications devoting money to books. For a while it looked like online blogs and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/about/us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goodreads</a>, a reader-generated online review site, might be plausible alternatives to more conventional media coverage of books, defying the norms set by professional critics. But by the 2010s, <a href="https://frappesandfiction.com/2022/03/19/book-blogging-is-dead-the-future-of-blogs/#:~:text=Well%2C%20in%20my%20personal%20experience,But%20that's%20okay." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the blogs had mostly disappeared</a> as their writers either stopped from the exhaustion of working for free or very little or, ironically, were absorbed into the mainstream. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/01/amazon-goodreads-elizabeth-gilbert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goodreads</a>, founded in 2007, was bought by Amazon in 2013 and has since become notorious as a den of pure spite. In June 2023, the author <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/12/1181714943/elizabeth-gilbert-halts-new-book-release-russia-ukraine">Elizabe</a><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/12/1181714943/elizabeth-gilbert-halts-new-book-release-russia-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">t</a><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/12/1181714943/elizabeth-gilbert-halts-new-book-release-russia-ukraine">h Gilbert</a> announced she was “halting” the release of her forthcoming book <em>The Snow Forest</em> after hundreds of people on the site, many claiming to be Ukrainian, denounced her book for being set in Russia and “<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elizabeth-gilbert-cancels-book-russia-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">romanticizing the aggressor</a>.” No one had read even an advance reader’s copy: all of the outrage was based simply on the fact of the location of the story. Gilbert, much to the consternation of many in the book world, capitulated to the hordes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the apparent power of social media websites to “cancel” famous writers like Gilbert, these outlets are still more fragile than institutions like the <em>New York Times</em>. Consider, for instance, everything happening now to TikTok, which could be gone by the time this goes to print. Social media trends tend to wax and wane while readers seek reliable reviews. The <em>Book Review</em>, in this fragile and ever-changing world, still exerts too much influence on book culture.</p>

<hr>

<p>Reading the <em>Book Review</em> is a joyless task because it is mostly so massively, stiflingly dull. There is a sameness and a flatness to the reviews, held as they are to some invisible set of <em>Times</em> “standards,” the most obvious one of which seems to be, “Never be interesting.” A recent review of Anthony Fauci’s memoir, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/18/books/review/on-call-anthony-fauci.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>On Call</em></a>, describes it as “a well-pressed gray flannel suit of a book with a white coat buttoned over it,” as if its dullness is the best thing about it. Other than a mild comment about the overuse of “bureaucratese” (phrases like “proof of the pudding” and “pushing the envelope,” which are simply clichés), the entire “review” by Alexandra Jacobs reads like a dutifully written 8th-grade summary.&nbsp; I have read reviews there by some of the wittiest writers whose prose sparkles elsewhere but who, when transplanted to the hallowed and hollow grounds of the <em>Times</em>, quietly shrivel and hush. To enter the world of the <em>Book Review</em> is to stumble into a boring tea party: everyone has nothing but niceties to murmur to each other, everyone is dropping quotes from Joan Didion and some dead white guys, and everyone’s tea is secretly laced with gin just to keep them going.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If there are opinions, especially negative ones, they are offered tremulously, coddled in several caveats, as in the review of Fauci’s book. This is by design. In 2018<em>, </em>Pamela Paul, the <em>Book Review</em> editor from 2013 to 2022, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/reader-center/book-review-conflicts-of-interest.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that it “has a long tradition of being a political Switzerland.” Paul eventually left her post to become an insipid <a href="https://www.hamiltonnolan.com/p/columnists-and-their-lives-of-quiet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bourgeois reactionary columnist for the <em>Times</em></a> opinion section, which indicates that even she grew tired of faking neutrality. But the principle still holds at the publication, where the reviews are so bland and sleep-inducing that one is tempted to hold every reviewer by their feet, upside down and outside a window, threatening to let go: <em>Give me an opinion, damn it! Now! Or I drop you! </em>A book review doesn’t have to be a vicious takedown in order to be interesting, but it should demonstrate some sense of a personality behind the work, of someone unafraid to deliver keen and original insights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Newspapers like the <em>Washington Post</em> and the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> do still have book sections, and there exist some publications devoted to reviews, like the <em>Boston Review </em>(<em>BR</em>)<em>, </em>the <em>New York Review of Books </em>(<em>NYRB</em>),<em> </em>and the <em>Los Angeles Review of Books </em>(<em>LARB</em>). There are transnational publications, like the <em>London Review of Books</em> (<em>LRB</em>) and the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em> (<em>TLS</em>). All of these vary in their purposes and personalities: the <em>LARB</em>, a magazine for refugees from academia, is the Goth-ish graduate student who drops words like “epistemic” in an effort to impress their theory professor. The <em>LRB</em>, the most idiosyncratic (and usually the most lively) of the bunch, is that very clever and slightly high uncle who tells you about the latest book he’s been reading when you stop to chat at the Christmas party. By the end of the very long conversation, you will have learned absolutely nothing about the book, but you will have received some fantastic insights into the career and life of Lord Byron (later, a Google search will reveal that the book is about a 20-century physicist). The <em>NYRB</em> is that very boring family friend who has no idea how to talk to anyone who’s not a tenured professor and consequently spends most of his time in an armchair. The only person who will talk to him is the <em>Book Review</em>, and the two promptly engage in a competition to see who can drop the most quotations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the newer review publications came about in the shadow of the <em>Book Review.</em> Some were formed as direct rivals (the <em>New York Review of Books </em>slyly took on a similar name at its inception in 1963). Others, like the <em>LRB</em>, which began life as an insert inside the <em>NYRB </em>and is famous for its long essays, usually on academic books, have consciously set out to be different. The <em>Book Review</em>, amidst all this, has resolutely stuck to its guns and persisted in being the most boring of the lot, holding on to its dullness as a badge of pride.</p>

<p>Its age has meant that the <em>Book Review</em> has survived like and alongside the descendants of the robber barons who swooped into New York and stuck around long enough to place their names on public institutions, their money and philanthropy enabling them to buy respectability as a new aristocracy.</p>

<p>Much of the <em>Book Review’s</em> reputation is based on lies and confabulation. For example: the famed bestseller list is, alas, utter bullshit. This fact first came to light in 1983, when William Peter Blatty, the best-selling author of <em>The Exorcist</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Book_Review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued the <em>Book Review </em></a>for not including his novel <em>Legion</em> in its best-seller list. Blatty claimed that the book had been selling well enough to be placed there. Blatty lost the case because the <em>Times</em> <a href="https://www.kallistipublishing.com/the-truth-about-the-new-york-times-best-seller-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> that its decisions about who is included are editorial and not purely based on quantitative figures. In other words, “Yes, you’re right, we ignored your book because we run on a lie. The bestseller list is not about the numbers, it’s about what we like!” Essentially, the <em>Times</em> admitted its “sales” list was meaningless (even as their website densely notes that their “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/methodology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">methodology</a>” involves sales). <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a42189320/the-new-york-times-best-seller-lists-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to <em>Esquire</em> in 2022</a>, Temple University professor Laura McGrath, who teaches courses on the publishing world, “compares <em>The New York Times’</em>&nbsp; list to the original recipe for Coca-Cola: ‘We have a pretty good idea of what goes into it, but not the exact amount of each ingredient.’” In 2013, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2013/02/22/heres-how-you-buy-your-way-onto-the-new-york-times-bestsellers-list/?sh=4d9965c33a7b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Forbes</em></a> wrote about authors gaming their way onto the list with bulk orders.</p>

<p>Given all this, how and why does the <em>Book Review</em>, an armageddon-era cockroach scuttling around in the long shadows of nuclear towers, survive?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like its parent paper, the <em>Book Review</em> is less a cultural mirror (what is happening around you?) and more of a ladder for class ascension (who will or can you be?). The <em>New York Times</em> is not a paper of record as much as a guide to class assimilation and ascension: to read and absorb the <em>Times</em> is to learn (or so people hope) how to exist in a world that is in many ways brought into existence by the <em>Times</em>, one inhabited and controlled by the superrich. The paper’s real estate listings and reporting and its column “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-hunt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hunt</a>” have long demonstrated that its core readership is either the very wealthy or those who aspire to be so. One column is titled, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/23/realestate/hamptons-home-sale-hunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">She Realized Her American Dream With a Hamptons House</a>” [that only cost $6.75 million]. Similarly, its “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/vows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vows</a>” section features couples from wealthy and often celebrity families. Often, real estates and vows combine, as when wealthy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/20/realestate/rome-italy-apartment-prices-hunt.html?region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc&amp;name=styln-the-hunt&amp;variant=show&amp;pgtype=Interactive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newlyweds</a> go looking for apartments. Over the years, the immensely wealthy have certainly grown more diverse, but their money remains the point. A recent wedding announcement about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/style/captain-sandy-yawn-wedding-leah-shafer.html">Sa</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/style/captain-sandy-yawn-wedding-leah-shafer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">n</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/style/captain-sandy-yawn-wedding-leah-shafer.html">dy Dolores Yawn</a>, a reality television celebrity, and her entrepreneur-gospel star wife, noted that their ceremony took place on a superyacht (we assume this is a term meant to denote a very, very, <em>very</em> big yacht, bigger than all the <em>merely </em>big yachts that the merely rich might use).&nbsp;</p>

<p>New York is always a city of a new Gilded Age, each one representative of its era, and the <em>Times </em>is in charge of shepherding the denizens of each up the social ladder. As with clothing fashions, its fascination with the wealthy shifts according to the political tenor of the day. The paper might now adopt a sniggering tone towards Donald Trump, but in 1984, it was once deeply, madly in love with him: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/11/01/archives/donald-trump-real-estate-promoter-builds-image-as-he-buys-buildings.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 1976 profile</a> began with the words, “He is tall, lean and blond, with dazzling white teeth, and he looks ever so much like Robert Redford.” In 1984, catching up with “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/08/magazine/the-expanding-empire-of-donald-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Expanding Empire of Donald Trump</a>,” William E. Geist gushed about accompanying him on tours of his properties, without questioning the machinations behind his supposedly legendary dealmaking. The long article notes that Trump, who presented himself as a real estate magnate, had ditched his “flashy haberdashery” for more conservative “dark suits, white shirts, subdued ties and loafers.” Then, as now, the <em>Times</em> provided a seal of approval to an aspiring entrepreneur busily taking his family name out of Queens into Manhattan, where the newspaper’s imprimatur was one more step towards entrance into the elite(s) of New York.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Book Review</em> is a ticket for entry into this world because one must not just be rich and successful, but <em>cultured,</em> able to engage in the topics of the day—and the best way to do that is through books. You might <em>buy</em> all the famed artworks you can afford, but to talk about them as a person of the class you’d like to occupy requires that you read all the “best” books that the <em>Times</em> will tell you about. The <em>Book Review</em> is like a culture sommelier, helping you sniff and sip through all the books, books, books, guiding you through an otherwise frightening world of words, words, words: it will tell you what to read or, at least, how to talk about the book you ought to read but might never get around to reading. (Similar to its <em>NYT</em> cousin, “The Ethicist” column, which instructs readers on proper—and often hideous—<a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/2024/04/the-bourgeois-morality-of-the-ethicist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bourgeois morality</a>, the <em>Book Review</em> will instruct you on proper bourgeois literary opinion.)</p>

<p>To ensure its blandness, the <em>Book Review</em> engages in that ever popular and deeply cringe-inducing tradition that we might call the Dinner Party Syndrome: the tendency to valorize writers (at least the big names) as People You Might Love to Know and Invite to A Meal with Other Writers. Bits of this exist everywhere, but it’s especially pronounced in Elisabeth Egan’s breathy and mercifully brief interviews with authors, gathered in her regular <em>Book Review</em> column, “Inside the Best-Seller List.” Egan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/books/review/demon-copperhead-barbara-kingsolver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tells us</a> that Barbara Kingsolver has established a tradition of including recipes in her books: “In <em>Demon Copperhead</em>, a beloved character makes black-eyed peas for New Year’s Day. Readers can practically smell the carrots, onions and essence of Christmas ham.” And she cannot resist a bad pun: “Kingsolver also baked in an important message about addiction.” The Author here is a BFF and down-home neighbor: famous writers are Just Like Us! In an interview with the suspense writer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/books/review/shes-not-sorry-mary-kubica.html?searchResultPosition=13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mary Kubica</a>, we learn that she fosters as many as a dozen cats at a time. As Egan tells us, warmly, “If you think about it, the process [of the family adjusting to the adopted cats] isn’t so different from writing books.” We can see the long-lasting effects of such an approach even in the most cerebral-seeming publications. <a href="https://yalereview.org/article/merve-emre-critic-as-friend?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR1UlNmFL7TsklxldlV7eDbO-2XCcG9y6WM1Lr0dbrP23yMRxwv0guqfa_I_aem_AcrKw5EMml_sTCz2zqjo34zBHzv7pjeLnjt1SSBnK3crgF6ZsKq0DSkbr6jKw690vTnmxiADMd3BVvQl-_PeuhF7%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a recent <em>Yale Review</em> </a>essay, Merve Emre writes rhapsodically about “The Critic as Friend,” ending with her assurance to the reader: “I can suggest that you may come to feel as I feel about a person, a book, that you may want to know it as intimately as I do. I can help it pass gracefully from my hand to another’s, from the present into the future.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The BFF-fication of the critic-subject pair finds its expression in the unhealthy parasocial relationships that authors find themselves compelled to develop with readers on platforms like BookTok and Bookstagram. The result is that they can no longer retreat as, say, <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/movies/2015/08/post_75.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joan Didion was able to</a>, behind their literal walls, to maintain a distance from overly friendly and sometimes dangerously enthusiastic fans. They must instead give in to their demands for actual social relations and are caught in a world of perennial selfies, both virtual and in real life. And yet, as Elizabeth Gilbert found out, no amount of such intimacy can guarantee that your readers will come to your support: her Instagram has long been filled with breathy videos that often start with greetings like, “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5CYkRnM7q3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hello, Family!</a>” or “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C5JHjRespi3/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s your Lizzy!</a>” and end with phrases like, “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C5JHjRespi3/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sending you a lot of love!</a>” Despite her relentlessly sunny chirpiness, all delivered in the style of an Aunty Karen, Gilbert still felt compelled to cancel herself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In keeping with its sommelier role, the <em>Times</em> only bothers with the <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/89038-over-the-past-25-years-the-big-publishers-got-bigger-and-fewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Five</a> publishers (soon, we suspect, to become The Only One, given the thrust towards consolidation). Forbidden from this world are books from independent publishers and writers without the cachet of known agents and publishers that <em>Times</em> employees are bound to bump into at literary parties. <a href="https://book-publicist.com/how-the-new-york-times-selects-books-for-review-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Self-published books (horrors!) are, of course, out of the question</a>. The <em>Times</em> has never challenged or even really interrogated the increasingly exploitative structure of the publishing world and, indeed, many of its main critics, such as Kakutani, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/dwight-garner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dwight Garner</a>, and Barry Gewen, have been able to use their status as critics at the paper to land publishing deals with places like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Wave-Radical-Disruption-Outsider-ebook/dp/B0C3ZK7W6R/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_w=S7OGp&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.f911c8db-3a2b-4b3e-952f-b80fdcee83f4&amp;pf_rd_p=f911c8db-3a2b-4b3e-952f-b80fdcee83f4&amp;pf_rd_r=139-2639195-3063806&amp;pd_rd_wg=px08Q&amp;pd_rd_r=fbd92857-b33d-484a-95ea-1cd0d0f0b5e5&amp;ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Penguin Random House</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Upstairs-Delicatessen-Eating-Reading-About-ebook/dp/B0BQGHJM5L/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.7nDQglnS2tlCD6IEdjvpxMyPootXHyx0jkmvWiArq9AjAbcwlsQcJkuT8lB2syWHpOFl3SwaVslXVf7PJCMwF2dnc10sR0G7ThQhvWH5QhDwehcul0wXiJ1izljEXaa_DUkinhoeyxqtRl5vZYUZcJtvHrYOF0KqSuFubm3T5287epbK-ZF0HJHMlN3S36NLTHBAu9Qq-jOAlECNxoVZHAwosFNKCXU1tbMpWGPZJe4.romk9gRk_Q5aHMdBDr0rGO9bPWcy8rEzFn7QndXs5Mg&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;qid=1719286773&amp;refinements=p_27%3ADwight+Garner&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Farrar, Straus and Giroux</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inevitability-Tragedy-Henry-Kissinger-World-ebook/dp/B07TK5RJ23/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1U2HHTNYBSYRL&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.GPN9UkRYYuzj01zdTwqGvr6AA722sS0H1xug4jSAepOcszmajScL81MQTk90j1k0.Cxt5U1qIFhAXP-GApriVTHRfue9rJHr3SkwNjJQIoec&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=barry+gewen&amp;qid=1719286810&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=barry+gewen%2Cstripbooks%2C98&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Norton</a>. While they and others might argue that their talent brought them such enviable deals, we should wonder aloud (as few are willing to do) if their (supposed) ability to make or break writing careers did not in some way help them to obtain their publishing contracts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This brings up the complex and occasionally thorny issue of ethics. The <em>Times</em>’s handbook of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/editorial-standards/ethical-journalism.html#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethical Journalism</a> can be found online, and the paper’s critics, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/a-o-scott" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/a-o-scott">.O Scott </a>and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/dwight-garner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dwight Garner</a>, have also posted individual statements online. But, as with its war reporting, ethics magically disappear. Dwight Garner, senior editor at the Book Review from 1998 to 2008 and currently a book critic, is married to Cree LeFavour, who has published<a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/authorpage/cree-lefavour.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a handful of cookbooks</a>, a novel, and a memoir, some of which are mentioned (more than once) or reviewed in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/search?query=Cree+LeFavour" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Times</em></a>. She has also frequently written book reviews. Sometimes there is mention of the fact that she is married to Garner. Food and wine writer Florence Fabricant favorably reviewed a new brand,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/dining/rocket-broth-for-sipping-or-souping.html?searchResultPosition=6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Rocket Broth</a>, noting only that the line is the creation of “Sheryl Moller, a certified health practitioner and nutrition guide, and <a href="http://www.creelefavour.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cree LeFavour</a>, a cookbook writer…” LeFavour’s father, Bruce LeFavour, was a well-known chef. His 2019 obituary in the paper notes that she confirmed his death, but it does not mention her marriage to Garner or that she is also a critic at the paper. Readers ought to know that books and broths recommended by the <em>Times</em> happen to be written and produced by someone who works at the paper (her reviews in the print edition occupy prime real estate) <em>and</em> whose husband occupies an influential position at the paper. But then, as we know from the poor quality of the <a href="https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/ny-times-found-no-7-october-rape-victims-reporter-admits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Times</em>’s coverage, such as their now-debunked Oct. 7 “mass rape” story</a>, “ethics” at the <em>Times</em> is a fungible commodity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And then there is the matter of race and ethnicity. Like every other publication of its ilk, including the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/15/1037323602/new-yorker-lack-of-diversity-magazine-bylines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>New Yorker</em></a>, the <a href="https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2012/why-88-of-books-reviewed-by-the-new-york-times-are-written-by-white-authors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Book Review</em></a> has been accused, justly, of being blazingly white. Kakutani is Japanese American (and perhaps the most powerful woman of color to ever have occupied such a position anywhere), and Gilbert Cruz replaced Pamela Paul in July 2022. There are more people of color reviewing books, and more books by people of color are being reviewed, certainly. And yet: the <em>Book Review</em> remains blindingly white in its outlook, moving between a discomfort with unfamiliar voices and styles to outright racism. The <em>Book Review </em>proves that whiteness—not as a racial identity but as a particular worldview—doesn’t need actual white people to extend its dominion. Karan Mahajan, reviewing Zadie Smith’s <em>The Fraud</em>, notes approvingly that she has a “multicultural eye,” and while we might imagine a giant ocular being surveying the London of the novel, it’s not clear what this brings to the book, which he mildly critiques as uneven in structure before quickly moving on with fulsome praise. But if a writer of the stature of Smith has produced an unevenly structured book, can it really be a fulfilling read or is the reviewer simply assuring white readers that Smith has, yet again, provided a lively cast of non-white people for their pleasure?&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for white critics incapable of engaging with the perceived Other: consider Dwight Garner’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/08/books/review/you-dreamed-of-empires-alvaro-enrigue.html#:~:text=What%20a%20treat%2C%20then%2C%20to,and%20the%20vibe%20is%20hallucinatory." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review</a> of the Mexican writer Álvaro Enrigue’s <em>You Dreamed of Empires</em>, in which he writes: “There are many names in this novel, and they can blur. To American ears, some of the most magnificent—Ahuitzotl, Xocoyotzin—sound like elite anti-depressants of the sort that only Sofia Coppola and Bad Bunny can source.” <a href="https://ohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com/127560643.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Some commenters on social media</a> pointed out that this is not only a deeply racist joke, but that the book includes a guide to pronouncing the names. Garner wrote this in 2024 (two years after Cruz took over), not 1954, as you might expect given its old-timey racism. Reading his words, I was reminded of a colleague’s boss who told his Indian employees that he couldn’t be bothered to learn their “difficult” names and would simply refer to all of them as “Ganesh.” Garner’s review of Enrigue’s book is a positive one, but he cannot resist several jabs, like his point that the writer, who has published several works translated into several languages worldwide, “has probably been best known as half of a literary power couple” and that “before their divorce, they were <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/alvaro-enrigue-valeria-luiselli-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">profiled in <em>Vogue</em></a>, adorably sharing a cigarette.” A white author featured in <em>Vogue </em>as part of a glamorous couple would have been written about with far more reverence, minus the sarcastic “adorably.” Here, Garner treats Enrigue as a curiosity. “Look,” he seems to say, “This adorable little foreigner can actually write! And haha, look at him preening in <em>Vogue</em> like one of us.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>But blatant racism is not the only problem: works by non-white authors are rendered as tokenistic, considered worthy not for their brilliance as novels or nonfiction but as the work of racial and ethnic Others who have something to <em>show</em> us—a part of, say, the immigrant experience. Bich Minh Nguyen’s 2007 memoir, <em>Stealing Buddha’s Dinner</em>, is about growing up as a Vietnamese refugee and the now-standard “torn between two cultures” experience that included a version of the Bento Box story: an immigrant child is mocked for their food and… you can fill in the rest because this trope became so ubiquitous that it is now <a href="https://www.eater.com/22239499/lunchbox-moment-pop-culture-tropes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dismissed as clichéd</a>. Nguyen, who has since changed her first name to Beth, wrote that first memoir when she was 33. Now, at 49, she has written a new one, <em>Owner of a Lonely Heart</em>, that continues the theme of her life story (really, there is only one) but with a new emphasis: her biological mother who stayed behind. But—worry not!—this memoir, reviewed by Sara Austin, also discusses food. Austin writes that Nguyen “was marked as a refugee by hostile stares and cruel jokes as a child, and as an adult in the way she can never quite unpack her bags in a new space.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Same book, new twists. Austin’s review says little about what Nguyen’s work contributes to the ever-growing genre of immigrant memoirs, has nothing to say about its politics, and only notes how it might make the reader <em>feel</em>: it is “poignant,” and “deeply ruminative and therapeutically self-indulgent.” Such is the kind of non-white fiction and nonfiction most favored by the<em> Book Review</em>. The immigrant’s story only exists to make us <em>feel</em> in a therapeutic way. This is not to blame Nguyen but a publishing and book review industry that seems unable to publish or review books by people who happen to be immigrants and are not just conduits for the same old stories. Nguyen had previously written two novels about similar life experiences but in fiction: like a squirrel hoarding its nuts for winter in its cheeks, she must feel compelled to carefully portion out bits and pieces of her life for literary consumption over the course of her writing career. Perhaps, in another decade, she will have the opportunity to capture a different slice of immigrant life, mining herself for yet another memoir (what might it be like to be the <em>mother </em>of second-generation immigrant children? we wonder, breathlessly). Might we ever reach a time when an immigrant writer writes about something other than stock immigrant experiences?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite any appearance of autonomy, Nguyen and others like her are not free to create non-traditional immigrant narratives because the responses of reviewers create a closed loop of influence: when reviewers only react positively to the same stale stories and cannot conceive that the darkies also have interesting lives unrelated to their immigration status, publishers and editors are more likely to demand the same stock texts about immigration or, really, anything else.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Book Review </em>may well wither and die under the weight of its own irrelevance, but it has had deleterious and long-term effects on writers and publishers—and it does not serve readers who look for work that disrupts their assumptions. Instead, the <em>Book Review</em> assumes they just want the same old boring oatmeal (<em>immigrant</em> readers, for instance, might be fed up with the same old trauma narratives). There are better and more interesting ways to think about books and book culture. One is to start thinking and actively writing about the economics of book publishing as part of the practice of reviewing books. Where the <em>Book Review</em> has for too long perpetuated stereotypes of books as fetish objects and authors as Sparkling Snowflakes we want to bring home to Mother, a better and more incisive book review culture would locate books firmly inside the material world, not outside of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this, podcasts—with more freedom and time and less pressure from traditional media—may be going in better, unexplored directions. Andrew Hankinson’s nonfiction podcast <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/sally-hayden-my-fourth-time-we-drowned/id1588244277?i=1000653348281" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Logroll</em></a> features writers who talk eloquently about their books within the context of the economics of publishing. In one episode, Hankinson talks to Sally Hayden, an independent researcher and author of <em>My Fourth Time We Drowned</em>, about refugees seeking to cross the Mediterranean Sea from Africa to Europe only to end up in detention centers in Libya. The conversation deftly connects the enormous difficulties facing these migrants with the trouble she had finding financial support for the project, all without being pedantic or engaging in white saviorism. <a href="https://www.backlisted.fm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Backlisted</em></a>, a fiction podcast fronted by John Mitchinson and Andy Miller, considers little-known authors or lesser-known books by famous authors. The two share a deeply infectious enthusiasm for their subjects and a keen knowledge of literary forms and histories, proving that a “love for books” does not have to mean a choice between weird parasociality and excruciating dryness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In more conventional outlets: the <em>Washington Post</em>’s Ron Charles <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/05/29/second-coming-garth-risk-hallberg-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writes</a> that Garth Halberg’s recent <em>The Second Coming</em> could have done with serious editing. Charles is not engaging in a snarky takedown but reflecting on an industry that churns out books, especially by star authors, <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/columns-and-blogs/soapbox/article/86324-the-end-of-editing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without investing in committed editors</a>. Editing was once considered an essential part of publishing, but this basic attention to detail is “unheard of today under a business model banking on the continual release of bestsellers and copycat stories.” Or, at least, considered secondary: I recently reviewed a book with passages repeated across chapters, a clear sign that no one at the prestigious imprint had bothered to give it a basic once-over before it went to print. In the <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/10/13/arts/mountains-damned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Boston Globe</em></a>, Lorraine Berry was one of the few (if any) book critics who pointed out that Barbara Kingsolver’s <em>Demon Copperhead</em>, based in Appalachia<em>, </em>is “a form of poverty porn, a slum tour where pity is the price of the ride.” (Berry also wrote about “A Day in the Life of a Freelancer” for <em>Literary Hub</em>, a <a href="https://lithub.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-freelancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rare piece</a> where a writer discusses the near impossibility of creating a writing life of any stability or comfort unless one possesses independent wealth.)</p>

<p>It is, in short, possible to take a deep pleasure in books and the act of reading without submitting to a <em>Book Review</em>-led, ah, fiction that A Life in Books stands apart from the material conditions of the world. The way forward is not to replicate or improve the <em>Book Review</em> but to be done with it and its anodyne presentation, after cataloging its effects on book culture. More works by small indie presses need to be considered in more outlets, and “self-published” should not always be so stigmatized. We might also consider regularly reviewing books of the past, instead of only bowing to the fashions generated by major publishers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There will undoubtedly be resistance to much of this and, sadly, writers are often the most obstinate about perpetuating myths about books and publishing. <em>Esquire</em>’s <a href="https://www.esquire.com/author/10298/kate-dwyer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kate Dwyer</a> regularly reports on the publishing world, <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a45751827/make-a-living-as-a-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but her work</a> is based on interviews with celebrity authors like Ayad Akhtar and Tom Perrotta, who are published by the Big Five, get excellent advances, and whose success and/or class status means they don’t have to take on day jobs to pay the bills. In a recent article on debut novels “<a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a60924704/debut-fiction-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failing</a>” to launch, she again focused on books at the Big Five, thus reproducing the idea—made popular by the <em>Book Review</em>—that those are what matter most and what should be counted. In such ways, we see the lingering effects of the cultish era (and aura) of reviewers like Kakutani and the mythology of the publishing world created by the <em>Book Review</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The dawn of the internet did not bring about a democratization of book reviews for the better—let us look again at Goodreads as an example of what can happen and then, quickly, look away. We still need critics to review publications that bring in intellectual and other histories while making judgments about books but without fetishizing books or authors. Good book reviews take their subjects and genres seriously: a romance novel deserves the same consideration as a satire of, oh, say, the publishing world. The style and purpose of the publication matter: a scholarly review will require a different set of facts and suppositions and a demonstration that the reviewer knows the history of a book’s subject; a website devoted to fans of an author or genre might allow for more emotional responses tempered by some kind of critical appraisal; and an outlet like the <em>Boston Globe</em> is more concerned with communicating ideas to a larger, broader range of readers.</p>

<p>Even with all these differences, there are still some basic principles of reviewing: reviews should in some way let readers know whether or not they should buy or borrow the book; readers should be able to trust that there are no conflicts of interest (consider, again, LeFavour and Garner). If a book is about 1950s suburban planning, it is pointless to spend three-quarters of the review ranting about gender imbalances in the workplaces of the time. We get it: you have a feminist politics, yay, but does the book provide an interesting history of its subject? Basic questions should be answered in some way: is the book’s thesis provable? If a novel, does it fulfill the basic requirements of plot and character? If it’s the kind of fiction that eschews such old-fashioned conventions, fine, but does it engage a reader in any way or is it simply like the sticker on a new Hermès bag: it doesn’t exist, and if you have to ask, you don’t know its value? Most of all, a review should deliver an opinion (this may seem like an obvious fact but, again, consider the<em> Book Review</em>).</p>

<p>Kakutani retired by <a href="https://observer.com/2017/07/michiko-kakutani-leaves-new-york-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taking a buyout </a>from her employer as the paper struggled to restructure and cut costs. In the years since her departure, she has written lavishly produced books that offer nothing more than warmed-over liberal takes on “democracy,” a favorite subject of hers. They have not gone over well: reviewing her 2018 <em>The Death of Truth</em> in the <em>Times</em>, Chris Hayes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/books/review/michiko-kakutani-death-of-truth.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> with the despair of a man who wondered how to retrieve lost hours, observing that “it feels like spending a few hours scrolling through the #Resist hashtag on Twitter.” Her more recent <em>The Great Wave: The Era of Radical Disruption and the Rise of the Outsider</em> can be described entirely by its title and reads like a transcript of a TED talk: a simple and simplistic claim, repeated ad nauseam with great sincerity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite a lackluster response to her books and even <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/02/michiko-kakutani-new-york-times-book-critic-great-wave-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">searing critiques</a>, Kakutani will probably keep getting book contracts while far more talented and interesting writers struggle even with article pitches as <a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2023/2023-news-deserts-report-penny-abernathy-medill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publications everywhere shutter</a> or <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/28/1172599212/web-buzzfeed-vice-gawker-facebook-twitter-media-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">struggle to find resources</a>. The <em>Book Review</em>, in all its stodgy glory, continues to exist. A <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?195760-1/inside-the-york-times-book-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2006</a> C-Span<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?326362-1/tour-new-york-times-book-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> interview </a>with its employees featured editors talking about the seemingly complicated processes that bring it to life, but the <em>Review</em> to date has no explanation for why a “best-selling” author like Miranda July might receive the attention of no fewer than three separate print pieces (invaluable real estate) and a podcast devoted to her latest book, <em>All Fours</em>, while independent publishers and debut writers struggle to get their copies seen. Does the <em>Book Review </em>create the market for a book or reflect it? How much of the coverage of July’s book has to do with her status as a Hollywood-adjacent influencer-style figure, possessed of the kind of glamor rarely seen in the publishing world? Even if it disappears tomorrow, the <em>Book Review</em>’s lasting legacy will be that it perpetuated the inequalities of a publishing world and replicated its false and damaging hierarchies by only paying attention to stardom or the potential thereof. It creates a demand for tired stories, repackaged endlessly in new guises and, too often, the publishing industry forces writers to write towards the <em>Book Review</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the course of its long existence, it has shaped literary tastes without any real commitment to appraisal or critique, and it has taken pride in its ability to carry on a tradition of nothingness, no real engagement with books, only an often smarmy, worshipful reverence for (certain) books and (certain) writers. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/18/books/smash-mouth-criticism.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a 2004 review of Dale Peck’s <em>Hatchet Jobs</em></a>, John Leonard—who hated the book—offered himself up as an exemplar of the best kind of critic. He reveals that, years ago, the <em>Times</em> had asked him to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/07/books/cheever-country.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review John Cheever’s last novel,</a> after the assignment had been turned down by many other critics who had balked because the book was not that good and they didn’t want to simply perform what Leonard called “a random act of kindness” to Cheever, who happened to be dying at the time. Leonard revealed, cheerily, that he was the one who agreed to review the novel because, “it never occurred to me that a thank-you note to a wonderful writer, a valediction as it were, would get me kicked out of any club I wanted to belong to, so I immediately said yes.” In other words, Leonard was unafraid to admit he had no integrity as a reviewer, and the <em>Times</em> was happy to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/07/books/cheever-country.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">print</a> his review.<sup><span>2</span></sup></p>

<p>As <em>Succession’</em>s Logan Roy might put it, these are not serious people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is easy to dismiss any criticism of the <em>Book Review</em> by claiming that it does not matter or that it is simply part of a mainstream publishing world. But as many writers know too well, the shoddy standards set by the <em>Review </em>have long tentacles, creating book markets even in the indie world (where trauma narratives and stock immigrant stories still seem to rule).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, much of the conversation around books and publishing ignores a vital fact: what we need is not a world where writers might aspire to gigantic advances or viral reviews to sell their books but one where they are supported in their work and are free to create and perhaps even fail—to tweak Dwyer’s judgmental term—in their endeavors without worrying about their next month’s rent or meals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We could continue to have long and ultimately meaningless conversations about “The Role of Critics and Criticism” (Emre has created something of a cottage industry in this realm of thought), but these usually ignore—and this bears repeating—the material conditions of publishing. Writers are not creative geniuses spinning books out of thin air but people who have to eat and find shelter while pursuing their work (the same is true of critics, unless, like Emre, they exist in that bubble somewhere between academia and influencer culture). Talking about the economics of publishing does not mean that books are rendered less meaningful or even, dare I say, less magical, less able to transport us from everyday life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But we can (and should) also think about books and their markets as elements of a constructed reality. A bestseller is marked as such by a meaningless gold star on a book cover, which tells us nothing about actual numbers, its quality, or whether a reader ought to read it. Whose books are reviewed or not depends on any number of unseen factors (including whether or not you are at the right parties or, you know, married to the right people). “Diversity” in publishing is often another way to compel non-white authors to provide cultural therapy to white readers.&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>Online and real-life discussions about the influence of the <em>Book Review</em> (waning or not) often <a href="https://www.autumnhouse.org/support-for-independent-publishers-is-more-important-now-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">result in calls to support more independent publishers</a>, who cannot afford to hand out sustainable advances to writers. The underlying logic here is that writers are on their own: if a writer truly wants to write, they will simply find a way. But this assumes that a writer is not a professional writer consumed by their work but, rather, someone who works on the side, perhaps after a long day at work or on the weekends, for whom writing is a hobby. Such an attitude also leaves untouched the world created by the <em>Book Review</em>, where only a few authors receive massive advances (<a href="https://theweek.com/articles/471659/lena-dunhams-new-advice-bookreally-worth-35-million-advance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lena Dunham’s $3.5 million</a> comes to mind, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/3/2/14779892/barack-michelle-obama-65-million-book-deal-penguin-random-house" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as does the Obamas’ $65 million</a>) and others don’t make enough to actually live on but must still, somehow, write. In the meantime, too many writers are persuaded by publications like <em>Esquire</em> that they will be the Special Ones to get big advances when, in fact, the system is rigged. This ecosystem, where writing is simply not considered labor, remains untouched.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The solution is not to continue the dichotomous system where the <em>Book Review</em> and its kin survive by only reviewing Big Five or academic publishers while indie presses (supposedly) deliver different fare. It is also not to fetishize ill-paid “indie” writing and the idea that good writers will just keep writing, because that simply means that “good” writers will also have to be independently wealthy to even write for small presses. For any real change to occur, we have to strip bare the fabrications and confabulations upon which so much of the publishing industry is built. Revealing the cracks and regimes of power within the <em>NYT</em>’s <em>Book Review</em> is only a start. To build a new ecosystem means admitting that the old one is rotten to the core. Karl Marx, as we have pointed out several times in this <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/2023/12/on-the-material-foundations-of-intellectual-production" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">magazine</a>, had to keep pawning his winter coat to survive and could never have produced his work without the financial support of Friedrich Engels. What is true of the original Marxist is also true of countless novelists who have relied on friends, families, lovers, and clients to help keep them writing.</p>

<p>We can fantasize about and through books all we want, but we cannot wish away the fact that books are made in and of the world itself. This includes the books we’ll never read because writers have been denied the means to create them.</p>
