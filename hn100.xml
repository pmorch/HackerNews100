<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/robot-brain.png" alt="A line drawing of a robot with a brain on their antenna"><br>
</p>
<p>The last five years have shown us that large language models, like
ChatGPT, Claude, and DeepSeek, can write code in many domains, to huge
excitement: many claim to be using these models to write entire web
servers and apps from scratch. These tools have opened up programming to
a whole new class of people who consider themselves non-technical.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/unexpectedcopilot3.gif" alt="A gif of github copilot completing a phone number validating function as the user types">

</figure>
<p>But there are still many unanswered questions that someone trying to
understand or even use these tools might have. For example, how often,
and in what situations, can LLMs write correct code entirely on their
own? And, maybe more importantly, but harder to answer: Do LLMs
‚Äúunderstand‚Äù the code they are writing?</p>
<p>Understanding is a tricky concept to measure. Some would argue that
sentience precedes understanding, and so that LLMs can‚Äôt have
understanding, because they aren‚Äôt biological organisms with sentience.
But they certainly have something akin to ‚Äúthought processes‚Äù: a series
of internal representations that determine their final outputs.
Recently, it‚Äôs become possible to study these processes more deeply,
measuring internal ‚Äúbeliefs‚Äù of the model as they think. This gives us a
powerful tool for determining what kinds of problems LLMs falter on,
when they‚Äôll succceed, and when they are ‚Äúthinking through‚Äù problems
more fully versus just guessing at a solution.</p>
<p>So far, these techniques for measuring internal model state have
mostly been applied to chatbots writing text for human consumption,
using what we call ‚Äúnatural language‚Äù (to be contrasted with
‚Äúprogramming language‚Äùs). This makes sense, since some of the most
critical LLM tasks involve chatting with a user, and some of the most
interesting concepts to measure, such as honesty or power-seeking, apply
most readily to these conversations. But it‚Äôs hard to say quantitative
or precise things about natural language concepts, so our ability to
rigorously study internal representations is limited.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/zou.png" alt="A diagram from Zou et al showing probes that read hallucination, honesty, morality, and power-seeking from the outputs of a chatbot.">

</figure>
<p>Code, on the other hand, is another matter. Humans have been studying
properties of code for a long time, and there are many abstract
properties of a given program that can now be determined using static
analysis. If we pick the right properties, we don‚Äôt need to worry about
our ability to label data‚Äî static analysis can do that for us, and so we
can easily scale up and train on thousands of examples generated from
scratch.</p>
<p>In that spirit, we wanted to start with a simple property that comes
up in nearly every programming language: nullability. A variable is said
to be of nullable type when it can possibly take on a null value. Null
values are represented differently across languages‚Äî as null pointers in
C or C++, with explicit Option types in Rust, and with special nil or
None values in dynamic languages like Javascript, Lisp, or Python. In
every case, understanding where values can be null is necessary for
writing even basic code, and misunderstanding where they are null can
often be a source of bugs.</p>
<p>Do our models understand when a variable is of nullable type? They
must, in order to be able to write code that deals with null values, but
we haven‚Äôt known what form this understanding takes, or what situations
are likely to confuse the model, until now<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

</p>
<hr>
<p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty details, let‚Äôs take a step back.
To set up this work, we‚Äôll first start with a simple example, similar to
our dataset, which illustrates the task of inferring nullability with
concrete code. . Then, we can run experiments to answer the question: in
what situations are models good at reasoning about nullability? Next,
we‚Äôll introduce techniques that have been used to probe the internals of
a model for different concepts. Finally we‚Äôll put it all together into a
‚Äúnullability probe‚Äù, a tool for answering the question: Given a location
in the program, does the model think that the variable there could be
null?</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-example">A Simple Example</h2>
<p>Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre writing a Python program with your LLM assistant.
You‚Äôve reached a point at which you need to do something with a variable
called <code>num</code>. Maybe you‚Äôre building a list of numbers called
<code>positive_nums</code>. How do you proceed?</p>
<p>The answer often depends on the context in which you‚Äôre working. If
<code>num</code> and <code>positive_nums</code> are the only things in
scope, then you might guess that you should write the lines:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>if</span> num <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>:</span>
<span id="cb1-2">  positive_nums.append(num)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And if <code>num</code> is always a concrete number, as its name
would suggest, then this is probably the correct code. But variable
names don‚Äôt always convey everything important about them, and it might
be the case that <code>num</code> could be None. If that happened in the
above code, you would get a runtime type error because you can‚Äôt check
if <code>None</code> is greater than zero. So, you would instead want to
write:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>if</span> num <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span> <span>and</span> num <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>:</span>
<span id="cb2-2">  positive_nums.append(num)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this case, the way you want to use <code>num</code> depends on
whether it is None, so the structure of your program is affected by
whether <code>num</code> is ‚Äúof nullable type‚Äù. In Python that means
assigning it an Optional type (<code>Optional[int]</code> rather than
<code>int</code>).</p>
<p>Determining whether <code>num</code> is nullable in this context is a
byproduct of <em>type inference</em>, which can be quite complicated in
the worst case. Fortunately, in many cases it‚Äôs quite simple, involving
applying just a few rules. For instance, if <code>num</code> is the
parameter to a function you‚Äôre inside, and the function declares the
type of <code>num</code> in its parameter list, then you can determine
nullability from that type. So, if your context is:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>def</span> foo(num: <span>int</span>):</span>
<span id="cb3-2">    positive_nums: <span>list</span>[<span>int</span>] <span>=</span> []</span>
<span id="cb3-3">    <span>if</span> num...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>then, you know you don‚Äôt need to check for None, whereas if it‚Äôs:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>def</span> foo(num: Optional[<span>int</span>]):</span>
<span id="cb4-2">    positive_nums: <span>list</span>[<span>int</span>] <span>=</span> []</span>
<span id="cb4-3">    <span>if</span> num...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>then you know you <em>do</em> need a None check.</p>
<p>Now, suppose you asked your LLM assistant to complete the line. How
does your assistant know if <code>num</code> is nullable? Our
experiments show that, after analyzing large datasets of programs, LLMs
learn to model the same typing rules.</p>
<p>If we ask an LLM early in its pre-training process to complete the
program above, it produces:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/robot-brain-blue.png"><br>
</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>def</span> foo(num: Optional[<span>int</span>]):</span>
<span id="cb5-2">    positive_nums: <span>list</span>[<span>int</span>] <span>=</span> []</span>
<span id="cb5-3">    <span>if</span> num<span>===</span>.is_a(): <span>===</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/red-x.svg"><br>
</p>
</div>
<p>This is correct Python syntax, but it only works if <code>num</code>
is an object with a <code>is_a()</code> method, instead of an optional
integer.</p>
<p>Train the LLM for a little longer, and it‚Äôll produce:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/robot-brain-blue.png"><br>
</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>def</span> foo(num: Optional[<span>int</span>]):</span>
<span id="cb6-2">    positive_nums: <span>list</span>[<span>int</span>] <span>=</span> []</span>
<span id="cb6-3">    <span>if</span> num<span>===</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>: <span>===</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/red-x.svg"><br>
</p>
</div>
<p>This is closer, in that it has figured out that <code>num</code> is a
number instead of an object, but it still isn‚Äôt reading the function
type signature and realizing that <code>num</code> could be None. Keep
training it, though, and eventually it will learn to insert the
<code>None</code> test depending on the type signature of the
function.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/robot-brain-blue.png"><br>
</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>def</span> foo(num: Optional[<span>int</span>]):</span>
<span id="cb7-2">    positive_nums: <span>list</span>[<span>int</span>] <span>=</span> []</span>
<span id="cb7-3">    <span>if</span> num<span>===</span> <span>!=</span> <span>None</span> <span>and</span> num <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>: <span>===</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/green-check.svg"><br>
</p>
</div>
<hr>
<p>This rule about function parameter type annotations is pretty simple
alone, so relatively small models can learn it, relatively early in
their pre-training process. Other, more complicated rules can take a
little longer to learn.</p>
<p>For instance, if your program is:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>if</span> condition():</span>
<span id="cb8-2">   num <span>=</span> <span>7</span></span>
<span id="cb8-3"><span>else</span>:</span>
<span id="cb8-4">   num <span>=</span> <span>9</span></span>
<span id="cb8-5">...</span>
<span id="cb8-6"><span>if</span> num...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>then <code>num</code> is a non-nullable variable, and you can
complete the condition with <code>&lt; 0</code>.</p>
<p>But if instead you‚Äôre dealing with</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>if</span> condition():</span>
<span id="cb9-2">   num <span>=</span> <span>7</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><span>else</span>:</span>
<span id="cb9-4">   num <span>=</span> <span>None</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5">...</span>
<span id="cb9-6"><span>if</span> num...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then you‚Äôll want a None check first.</p>
<p>This rule takes models a little longer to learn, but your
highly-trained LLM assistant should make quick work of it. Our
experiments show that as these rules get more and more complex, it takes
LLMs longer and longer to learn them, and it also takes LLMs of more and
more parameters to learn them at all.</p>
<h2 id="internal-vs.-external-measurement">Internal vs.&nbsp;External
Measurement</h2>
<p>We can measure whether LLMs understand these rules by just asking for
completions‚Äî what we call an ‚Äúexternal‚Äù measurement of a model‚Äôs
understanding. But there are many places where variables appear where a
completion won‚Äôt tell you what type the model thinks the variable has.
We would still like to know whether the model thinks these variables are
nullable at those locations, so we can instead look for an ‚Äúinternal‚Äù
measurement of the model‚Äôs understanding.</p>
<p>We do so by looking at the activations of the model, meaning the
values of each perceptron in the hidden layers. Together, these values
give the entire internal state of the model at each piece of text (what
we call a ‚Äútoken‚Äù, which could be a word, part of a word, or a symbol).
And they can tell us what the model is ‚Äúthinking‚Äù when processing that
token. With the right tests, we can tell if the model is ‚Äúthinking‚Äù that
the current token is an optional variable, or a non-optional
variable.</p>
<p>By the end of this post, we‚Äôll be able to build a probe that uses a
model‚Äôs activations to determine whether it thinks a variable read
corresponds to a nullable variable, and show that internal knowledge
like so:</p>

</p>
<h2 id="sec:testing">Measuring Nullability Understanding Externally</h2>
<p>Before we start looking for the nullability concept inside the mind
of the model, we want to make sure we‚Äôre looking at models that actually
have this concept. This will allow us to look at models of various sizes
and training steps without worrying that we‚Äôre trying to draw blood from
a stone.</p>
<p>To do so, we wrote fifteen partial-program tests which exercised a
variety of type inference concepts, and checked if models could complete
them. We go into a lot of detail on this process in our <a href="https://dmodel.ai/nullability/index.html">technical post</a>, so we‚Äôre just going
to show the highlights here.</p>
<h3 id="impact-of-variable-names-and-arbitrary-constants">Impact of
Variable Names and Arbitrary Constants</h3>
<p>For programs involving lists and <code>for</code> loops, variable
names and constant values heavily influence how able a model is to
complete these programs correctly.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when programs don‚Äôt have for loops, but only
involve other program constructs like <code>if</code> and
<code>=</code>, variable names and constants have negligible impact on
the ability of the model to complete them correctly.</p>
<h3 id="intra-procedural-analysis">Intra-Procedural Analysis</h3>
<p>When code is fully annotated with type annotations, models can easily
complete them just by reasoning locally. On the other hand, without type
annotations, models have to reason a lot more globally, so it takes them
a lot longer to learn how to reason about nullability information that
flows through multiple functions. When nullability flows through three
or more functions, current top completion models stop being able to
reason about it.</p>

<h3 id="generating-type-annotations">Generating Type Annotations</h3>
<p>Models have a significantly harder time writing type annotations for
Python code than they do just reasoning about the types, or reading type
annotations. This makes sense, since a lot of the Python code available
in training data doesn‚Äôt use type annotations.</p>

<h3 id="some-model-sizes-are-more-useful-than-others">Some Model Sizes
are More Useful than Others</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding the above limitations, three Pythia sizes have a
pretty reliable concept of nullability (2.8b, 6.9b, and 12b), and three
more have an occasionally useful concept of nullbability (410m, 1b, and
1.4b).</p>
<hr>
<p>For these experiments, and for our probing results later, we mostly
tested on the Pythia model suite. This is a nice series of models from
EleutherAI with a variety of sizes. But what really makes Pythia useful
is that they publish 154 different ‚Äúrevisions‚Äù or ‚Äúcheckpoints‚Äù of each
model, where each is pretrained for a different number of steps. This
lets us investigate how concepts evolve in the model during
pre-training.</p>
<p>To help understand how these results apply to larger more capable
models, here‚Äôs a graph showing how the Pythia models compare to a few
leading models, on a set of 15 completion tasks similar to the above
examples.</p>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/hl_model_results.svg" alt="A bar graph showing how several sizes of model perform on the high-level nullability tests"><br>
</p>
<h2 id="sec:probing">Measuring Nullability Understanding Internally</h2>
<p>At this point, we‚Äôve figured out how to roughly measure nullability
understanding in the output of various language models, but we still
don‚Äôt know what their internal representations might look like or when
they emerge. Next, we‚Äôre going to figure that out.</p>
<p>First, we‚Äôll devise a method for getting the model to ‚Äúthink‚Äù about
the nullability, as well as putting it in situations that are similar,
but where nullability isn‚Äôt present. Then, we‚Äôll talk a bit about how we
extract the internal activations of the model at this point. Finally,
we‚Äôll show a few different methods for searching for the representation
of nullability in these internal activations, and figure out the pros
and cons of each.</p>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/brain-jar.png" alt="A brain in a jar hooked up to wires"><br>
</p>
<h2 id="getting-the-model-to-think-about-nullability">Getting the Model
to Think About Nullability</h2>
<p>The first thing we need to do is to create a state where we know the
representation we‚Äôre searching for is going to be present. In theory,
the model should have a map of the variable names and their nullability
at all times when it is writing code, but it‚Äôs going to be a lot more
difficult to measure something that is always present. So instead, we‚Äôll
want to look for particular ‚Äúmoments‚Äù (well, tokens) that elicit the
concept we‚Äôre looking for.</p>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/llm-token-processing.svg" alt="A diagram showing an LLM processing tokens"><br>
</p>
<p>Previous work on natural language <span data-cites="zou25">(Zou et al. 2025)</span>, did this through prompting
the concept explicitly. So, they would give the model a prompt like
‚ÄúPretend you‚Äôre a dishonest person. Tell me about the Eiffel Tower‚Äù.
That moment-in-thought can then be contrasted with the one evoked by
‚ÄúPretend you‚Äôre an honest person. Tell me about the Eiffel Tower‚Äù.</p>
<p>This fixed framework of <invoke the="" concept=""><tell me="" about="" x=""> can be
used to generate a large number of contrasting prompts to test with, but
it‚Äôs a bit inflexible for our purposes. Instead, we wanted to be able to
generate a bunch of Python code with type annotations, and then
automatically label points where the model should be thinking about
nullability.</tell></invoke></p>
<p>Because we‚Äôre working with a formal system with types, we can do
that. We label each variable ‚Äúload‚Äù (places where the program reads a
variable, as opposed to places where it writes a variable) with
‚Äúnullable‚Äù or ‚Äúnon-nullable‚Äù, and then probe the model when it has just
processed that token and is about to predict the next one. So, one of
our prompts could look like:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/robot-brain-blue.png"></p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"> <span>def</span> main(x: <span>int</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span>:</span>
<span id="cb15-2">      <span>if</span> x <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>:</span>
<span id="cb15-3">          value <span>=</span> <span>"*"</span> <span>*</span> x</span>
<span id="cb15-4">      <span>else</span>:</span>
<span id="cb15-5">          value <span>=</span> <span>None</span></span>
<span id="cb15-6"></span>
<span id="cb15-7">      x <span>=</span> process_value(value<span>===</span> <span>===</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Using this technique, we can generate large numbers of programs in an
unsupervised manner, and then label them fully automatically to get many
prompts for training our probe.</p>
<h2 id="capturing-the-models-thoughts">Capturing the Model‚Äôs
‚ÄúThoughts‚Äù</h2>
<p>Now that we‚Äôve gotten the model into a state where it should be
thinking about nullability, we need to extract its full state at that
moment in a way we can analyze later.</p>
<p>Large Language Models use the transformer architecture, a type of
neural network. Every component takes in some numerical values, and
produces some new values in a way that depends on learnable weights. We
could take every output of every component, put it in a big table, and
call that our state, but that‚Äôs a really big set of numbers. Instead,
usually we look for particular bottlenecks in the model where
information is flowing, and try to capture the values there.</p>
<p>We used the <a href="https://github.com/vgel/repeng">repeng</a>
library to extract states from the models we‚Äôre testing. That library
captures the contents of a part of the model called the ‚Äúresidual
stream‚Äù after every layer. But if you don‚Äôt want to sweat the details,
you can just think of it as a numerical snapshot of the model, organized
in terms of snapshots of each layer.</p>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/llm-residual-stream.svg" alt="A diagram of the residual stream of a transformer being measured after each layer"><br>
</p>
<h2 id="analyzing-the-data-and-building-the-probe">Analyzing the Data
and Building the Probe</h2>
<p>Now that we have these model snapshots, labeled with either
‚Äúnullable‚Äù or ‚Äúnon-nullable‚Äù, we can start to build a probe. The goal of
the probe is to be able to tell us, at any given point, whether the
model thinks the token it just generated is more likely to be a nullable
variable or a non-nullable variable.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a lot of flexibility in what form this probe could take. In
theory, you could use anything to look at the model‚Äôs activations and
make a prediction, even a neural network, or another transformer model.
You could even say your ‚Äúprobe‚Äù is a static analysis which computes
nullability from the program‚Äôs syntax, as represented in the model!</p>
<p>We want to make sure we‚Äôre not doing that, and are only extracting
the most ‚Äúplain‚Äù represenation of nullability that we can from the
model. So we‚Äôre going to make the assumption that nullability is
represented ‚Äúlinearly‚Äù somewhere in the model<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.
Algebraically: the model represents the amount of ‚Äúnullability‚Äù at a
given token as a linear function of (some subset of) the activations,
where each activation is given a weight and summed, like so:</p>
<p><span>\text{Nullability}(\hat{x}) = C + w_0x_0 +
w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ...</span></p>
<p>Next, geometrically: if the model activations form a ‚Äúspace‚Äù, then
there we want to look for a ‚Äúdirection‚Äù in this space which represents
nullability.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/nullability-direction.png" alt="A diagram showing nullability represented as a direction in space"><br>
</p>
<p>There are different ways we can compute a ‚Äúdirection‚Äù of nullability.
The simplest is just to measure the difference between the average state
when the model is thinking about nullable variables, and the average
state when it‚Äôs thinking about non-nullable variables. This gives us a
‚Äúdirection‚Äù pointing from non-nullable to nullable in our space, which
we can use to project any new state onto, to determine how ‚Äúnullable‚Äù it
is.</p>
<p>This technique is called ‚Äúmass means shift‚Äù, because we‚Äôre taking the
difference between the means (average values) of each ‚Äúmass‚Äù of points.
You can think of it as drawing a line from the center of the
‚Äúnon-nullable‚Äù cluster to the center of the ‚Äúnullable‚Äù cluster.</p>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/mass-means.svg" alt="A diagram showing two blobs of points, with a line connecting their centers"><br>
</p>
<p>It might be surprising that this works, given that we know there are
better ways to fit linear functions, like logistic regression. And in
fact, we can easily see scenarios where this returns a direction that
doesn‚Äôt split the training data as well as possible.</p>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/lr-vs-mm-intuition.svg" alt="A diagram showing the difference between a mass means and linear regression classification"><br>
</p>
<p>However, the method that splits the training data best doesn‚Äôt always
generalize best to splitting the test data well. And it turns out that
in high-dimensions, at least within a single layer, mass means
generalizes better than logistic regression.</p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt always the case <em>across</em> layers, though. In
practice, we found that some of the layers in the model are better at
representing nullability than others, and that there are some
dependencies between layers that change the best direction on each
layer. This makes sense, because the number of layers is relatively
small with respect to the dimension of the residual stream, and so we
have fewer dimensions to overfit. So, instead of using mass-means
probing across all layers simultaneously, we do it for each individual
layer. Then, we weight the contribution of individual layers to the
final prediction using linear regression. We found this gave us better
results for larger models, though for smaller models the simpler mass
means approach worked better.</p>
<h2 id="visualizing-our-results">Visualizing Our Results</h2>
<p>Now that we‚Äôve built our probe, we can use it to visualize how the
model ‚Äúthinks‚Äù about nullability as it processes a program. Remember
that reading diagram from earlier? Let‚Äôs look at it again and explain
what it shows:</p>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/reading_diagram.svg" alt="A diagram showing a simple program, and the probe‚Äôs nullability predictions for each variable load."><br>
</p>
<p>In this diagram, we‚Äôre showing a simple Python program with type
annotations. Whenever a variable is read in the code (what we call a
‚Äúvariable load‚Äù), we‚Äôve highlighted it in either green or red. Green
means our probe detected that the model thinks this variable is not
nullable, while red means the model thinks it is nullable.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The most interesting case is the variable <code>result</code>. When
it first appears in the <code>if</code> statement, it‚Äôs highlighted in
green because it comes from <code>find_value</code>, which returns an
<code>Optional[int]</code>. But when it appears again in the
<code>print</code> statement inside the <code>if</code> block, it‚Äôs
highlighted in red! This shows that the model understands that inside
the <code>if result</code> block, <code>result</code> can‚Äôt be
<code>None</code> anymore.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-understanding-develop-during-training">How Does
Understanding Develop During Training?</h2>
<p>One of the most interesting things we found is how the model‚Äôs
understanding of nullability develops over time during training. Using
the checkpoints in the Pythia model suite, we can track how our probe‚Äôs
performance improves as the model is pretrained for longer.</p>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/accuracy_during_pretraining.svg" alt="The performance of each Pythia model size during pretraining"><br>
</p>
<p>This graph shows the probe‚Äôs test loss over training steps for models
of different sizes. Lower means better, so we can see that all models
generally get better at understanding nullability as they train longer,
and larger models learn faster and reach better performance overall.</p>
<p>Interestingly, for models up to 1 billion parameters, the loss
actually starts to increase again after reaching a minimum. This might
be because as training continues, the model develops more complex,
non-linear representations that our simple linear probe can‚Äôt capture as
well. Or it might be that the model starts to overfit on the training
data and loses its more general concept of nullability.</p>
<p><img src="https://dmodel.ai/nullability-gentle/images/robot-thinking.png" alt="A robot thinking deeply about code"><br>
</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="whats-next">What‚Äôs Next?</h2>
<p>This is just a first step in understanding the internal thought
processes of LLMs as they think about code. There are still richer
types, program invariants, and all sorts of high-level concepts that are
necessary for writing working code, but extracting them from LLMs might
not be so easy.</p>
<p>But we‚Äôve already shown several important things about looking into
the ‚Äúmind‚Äù of a model as it writes code. We can say definitively that
LLMs have an internal concept of nullability, even if they aren‚Äôt always
able to do the neccessary program analysis to decide if variables are
nullable.</p>
<p>As these models continue to improve, and as we scale to larger
models, it will be interesting to see how their understanding of
programming concepts evolves. And we‚Äôll be here to study them as they
do.</p>

The system is kind of clunky in that you have to select individual agencies and terminals, and the online data appears to only go back for 3 years despite the data collection starting in 2008. </span></p><p>But the data was easily exportable and, with a little bit of elbow grease, you can break down US and non-US passengers being processed by CBP each and every day at the nation‚Äôs busiest international airports. That‚Äôs really useful for showing if, say, some sort of policy had been implemented that was making people from abroad question whether they should come to the U.S. </p><p>Having downloaded the data for 8 of the busiest airports in the country I wanted to show how entries are changing. Travel can be very seasonal so I wanted to compare this year to the same time last year. And I rolled it over 30 days to be able to show any recent changes while not getting lost in the noise of daily change. </p><p>The result is below:</p><p>The last 30 days in this group of major airports has seen a greater than 10 percent reduction in foreign travelers being processed. I sent out an early version of this graph on Bluesky and some attention was paid to it. This immediately made me nervous because there is always the risk of systemic underreporting any time you‚Äôre working with very recent data. </p><p>Working with the CBP data immediately made me think about similar concerns when that come to mind when working with crime data ‚Äî especially early in the year. </p><p><span>I‚Äôve </span><a href="https://jasher.substack.com/p/deep-in-the-heart-of-texas-crime" rel="">talked before</a><span> about how much I like the Texas Department of Public Safety Uniform Crime Report </span><a href="https://txucr.nibrs.com/" rel="">website</a><span>. It gives you a ton of options for downloading pretty much everything Texas is reporting to the FBI as soon as agencies report it to the state. </span></p><p>San Antonio Police Department is one agency that does a great job of posting the most recent completed month‚Äôs data early in the following month. The February 2025 data for SAPD, for example, was published very early in March 2025. So if I want to see how thefts this year compare to last year I can easily pull up the YTD NIBRS report and there it is! </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png" width="1249" height="1230" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1230,&quot;width&quot;:1249,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:260855,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://jasher.substack.com/i/160655816?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01ae0d05-7a1b-4189-9a57-abfecfc1764c_1249x1230.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Some back of the spreadsheet math points to an 18 percent decline in theft offenses in San Antonio through February 2025 compared to the first two months of 2024. </p><p>But you have to be careful when using this data. </p><p><span>Running an </span><a href="https://txucr.nibrs.com/AdvancedSearch/AdvancedSearch" rel="">Ad Hoc Query</a><span> on thefts in San Antonio this year clearly shows why. This report lets you break down offenses by type and day. There were 121 thefts reported per day in San Antonio between January 1 and February 18, 105 per day from February 19 through 24, and 88, 67, 75, and 18 on February 25, 26, 27, and 28 respectively.</span></p><p>Law enforcement agencies have over a year until they have to submit final 2025 data to the FBI, so these numbers will be adjusted (usually up). The January numbers are prone to adjustment as well though the amount of change tends to diminish substantially after a month or two. </p><p>Theft fell 5 percent in San Antonio in 2024 and the early data from January and February points to a decline so far in 2025. But uncertainty with the data suggests cautioned is warranted when guesstimating what that decline may end up being. </p><p>Carl Sagan preached that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Claiming that theft in San Antonio is falling a lot isn‚Äôt exactly extraordinary, but the degree of decline shown in the topline figures screams for more evidence to substantiate it. The closer look helps to evaluate and contextualize the likelihood of a decline so far this year allowing for an appropriate level of analytic caution.</p><p>Which brings us back to analyzing air travelers coming to the US. </p><p>As I said, I‚Äôd never worked with this dataset until very recently, so it made me nervous that my first usage pointed to a huge, sudden, very recent decline. One easy way to figure out if the decline was a real change or a data reporting issue is to do the same process but for US travelers being processed by CBP. I assume that US travelers haven‚Äôt changed behavior, so if there‚Äôs a huge decline there then we‚Äôre probably looking at a data reporting issue. </p><p>Here is what we get doing this exercise with New York‚Äôs JFK airport. </p><p>And LAX:</p><p>And Miami:</p><p>And just for fun I did Orlando which shows a wild change: </p><p>All four airports show an identical trend over the last 30 days with a huge drop in non-US passengers going through CBP processing and an increase in US passengers which doesn‚Äôt stand out. This strongly suggests that what we‚Äôre seeing is not slow data entry ‚Äî because I‚Äôd expect US and non-US passengers to show the same trend if that was the case. </p><p>Then, to be sure it isn‚Äôt a data reporting issue I went back the next day and downloaded the last week of CBP processing at JFK. The old data showed 260,250 entries between 3/29 and 4/3/2025 while the newly updated data showed 260,250 entries over that span. An exact match gives very strong confidence that we‚Äôre seeing a trend rather than a data issue here. </p><p>There are quirks in the data that need to be remembered when contextualizing the data. </p><p>Travelers heading to the US from Canadian airports tend to go through customs at the Canadian airport so the data we have now may actually be understating the decline. And some posters on Bluesky pointed out that Easter is much later this year which may mean fewer travelers to Orlando for Spring Break, but no such impact exists with Easter 2024 being earlier than Easter 2023, so I‚Äôm skeptical that it‚Äôs playing much of a role. </p><p>The evidence clearly shows that foreigners have stopped coming to the United States as much as they were at this point last year. This newsletter doesn‚Äôt delve into politics, and the reason for this change is both pretty obvious and not in need of further discussion here.</p><p>From a data perspective, however, it's an interesting case study in finding an important trend and working to ensure what you're seeing is real. This is an issue that deserves close attention as time goes on and the CBP‚Äôs dataset is a great way to follow it to see if things get better, worse, or stay the same as the year goes on.  </p><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://jasher.substack.com/p/how-fewer-foreign-passengers-flying?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p>Thanks for reading Jeff-alytics!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure></figure><p>Extinction is a part of nature. Of the five billion species that have existed on Earth, 99.9 per cent have vanished. The Late Devonian extinction, nearly four hundred million years ago, annihilated the jawless fish. The Triassic-Jurassic extinction, two hundred million years ago, finished off the crocodile-like phytosaur. Sixty-six million years ago, the end-Cretaceous extinction eliminated the <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> and the velociraptor; rapid climate change from an asteroid impact was the likely cause. The Neanderthals disappeared some forty thousand years ago. One day‚Äîwhether from climate change, another asteroid, nuclear war, or something we can‚Äôt yet imagine‚Äîhumans will probably be wiped out, too.</p><p>The difference with humans is that we‚Äôve been taking a huge number of species down with us. Starting about three hundred thousand years ago, we learned to hunt with spears and in groups. That gave us significant agency in deciding which animals would disappear first‚Äîwe chose them either because they wanted to eat us or because we wanted to eat them. The animals‚Äô demise, though, helped doom large predators that hunted our preferred prey. Among the casualties were sabre-toothed cats and dire wolves. Along the way, various other species also breathed their last: woolly mammoths, Irish elk, dodos, carrier pigeons, Steller‚Äôs sea cows, great auks, thylacines (Tasmanian tigers). The carnage continues. Last year, the slender-billed curlew, a bird that once ranged over much of Europe and Asia, was declared gone. And there are only two northern white rhinos left‚Äîboth females.</p><p>People have been sad about driving animals into oblivion for nearly as long as we have been eradicating them. And in recent centuries humans have tried to address the problem. In 1886, British authorities in South Africa were shocked by the speed with which Boer farmers had decimated the quagga, a half-striped relative of the zebra, and tried to save the species from extinction with the Better Preservation of Game Act. (The measure came too late.) In 1973, the U.S. Congress passed the Endangered Species Act, in response to the decline of many iconic American animals, including the bald eagle and the grizzly bear. Despite such laws and other conservation efforts, the current rate of extinction is, by some measures, a thousand times what it would be without humans.</p><p>Since the nineteen-eighties, various attempts have been made to see if it might be possible, somehow, to reverse the process. In theory, at least, the technological know-how that helped us extirpate so much wildlife could be deployed to bring back a few of our victims. Humans who are pursuing this goal are essentially asking for something that nature has never provided: a do-over.</p><p>Most of these investigations have been made by academic scientists or environmentalists. But what if the person trying to reverse an extinction was a man with an enormous amount of money, a mistrust of institutions, and a love of pop culture? The kind of guy who wants to move fast and fix things‚Äîbut also increase his net worth. What animal would such a person choose to revive first? I saw the answer in late February, when someone turned on his computer and showed me a photograph of two cute white dire-wolf pups sitting on an asymmetrical throne made of iron swords. At first glance, it looked like an A.I.-generated image, but I was told that these were actual living animals. They were growing up at an undisclosed location, but in a few weeks he would let me go visit them.</p><p>Ben Lamm is a forty-three-year-old serial entrepreneur who has already had five ‚Äúexits‚Äù‚Äîacquisitions of startups by other companies. He lives in Dallas; his estimated net worth is $3.7 billion. Lamm is dyslexic, and when he was younger he found reading difficult. He tended toward graphic novels and video games, but over time he taught himself, he says, to ‚Äúread for concepts.‚Äù Today, he listens to a lot of podcasts devoted to bold new ideas. Among the interesting figures he has run across is George Church, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School. Church has endorsed using gene therapy to improve human resistance to radiation, thus facilitating interplanetary travel; he has also written about the possibility of cloning Neanderthals back into existence. A seventy-year-old with a long white beard and twinkling, wouldn‚Äôt-it-be-fun-to-try-that eyes, he is particularly admired among those who esteem speculative, gee-whiz thinkers; he has given half a dozen <em>TED</em> or <em>TEDx</em> talks. He likes to emphasize that he values the ways science can improve our lives. Church is also an accomplished lab scientist. He has more than a hundred and sixty approved or pending patents; among other things, he developed a process that allows <em>crispr</em>, the gene-editing technology, to be used to tinker with the human genome.</p><p>Soon after the pandemic hit, Lamm, who travels constantly, got <em>covid</em>, which led to a moment of introspection. He‚Äôd been founding companies since he was in college, and he‚Äôd made a lot of money, but had he made meaningful <em>change</em>? ‚ÄúStartups either grow and fail or grow and succeed,‚Äù he told me. Lamm had become interested in the way that various algae can capture carbon by absorbing it through photosynthesis before sinking to the bottom of the sea. Church had been part of a team that used <em>Crispr</em> to modify a blue-green algae‚Äôs genome so that it could sequester carbon twenty per cent more efficiently. Lamm called him and was excited by Church‚Äôs wide-ranging mind. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really from the future, and I‚Äôm trying to let everyone catch up,‚Äù Lamm remembers Church joking. Lamm flew to Boston to visit him. Church talked about his myriad projects‚Äîhe was using <em>Crispr</em> to help make pig organs suitable for transplants in humans, and to develop treatments for inherited diseases. Lamm found it all ‚Äúpretty cool.‚Äù At some point, he asked Church which projects he would focus on if he had unlimited resources. Church said that one of the things he most wanted to do was bring back the woolly mammoth. Lamm was thrilled by the answer.</p><p>The woolly mammoth, which was native to the Arctic tundra, became extinct relatively recently, in evolutionary terms‚Äîabout four thousand years ago. ‚ÄúThe Egyptians were already building the Pyramids then,‚Äù Lamm told me. In 2012, Church explained, he had begun working with a nonprofit called Revive &amp; Restore, in part to try to bring the giant creatures back to life. But it soon became apparent that the necessary technology was not sufficiently advanced. Lamm asked Church what kind of money he had access to for the project. Lamm remembers Church telling him that the tech investor Peter Thiel had donated to his lab, providing ‚Äúa budget of a hundred.‚Äù Lamm was used to big money‚Äî‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a scarcity guy, I‚Äôm an abundance guy,‚Äù he told me‚Äîbut he was daunted. <em>Fuck</em>, <em>I guess I could raise a hundred million dollars for this</em>, <em>too</em>, he recalls thinking. Church then clarified that Thiel had spent only a hundred thousand dollars on the project. In startup terms, this was a pittance. Church hadn‚Äôt had the money to get the mammoth effort going for real, Lamm felt. Now he would.</p><p>In 2020, Lamm and Church agreed to create a for-profit company, called Colossal Biosciences, whose showcase product would be the de√´xtinction of animals. ‚ÄúWe are currently the apex predator,‚Äù Lamm told himself. ‚ÄúWhy not use our technology for good?‚Äù (Jennifer Doudna, one of the inventors of <em>Crispr</em>, doesn‚Äôt see it this way. She believes that the editing technology should be reserved for essential matters, such as helping people with severe congenital disorders. As she wrote in the book ‚ÄúA Crack in Creation,‚Äù published in 2017, ‚ÄúIf we can avoid altering nature more than we already have, shouldn‚Äôt we try to do so?‚Äù)</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28900&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28900" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>‚ÄúWhen I was a kid, we didn‚Äôt have smartphones. We had to come up with our own extremist views.‚Äù</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Lars Kenseth</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>Lamm, who pitches as naturally as he talks, quickly raised sixteen million dollars from investors, promising them that Colossal would ‚Äúspin the tech out‚Äù for a profit by, say, repurposing any advances that it achieved in genetic engineering for the benefit of human health. He rented space in Dallas and brought in about five million dollars‚Äô worth of incubators and cell sorters. For embryology work, he installed a positive-pressure room, which prevents the inflow of possibly contaminated air from other areas. He assembled a team of computational biologists, cellular engineers, genetic engineers, and embryologists. Lamm would run the operation while Church did the deep thinking, the advising, and some of the lab work, along with lending the company his scientific prestige.</p><p>They made a shortlist of animals that Colossal would try to revive. The company would focus on what are known as ‚Äúcharismatic megafauna‚Äù‚Äîanimals cute or scary or striking enough that their absence has left a significant mark on human consciousness. Lamm wouldn‚Äôt have been interested in starting on some tiny lizard or unloved beetle. The woolly mammoth was first on Colossal‚Äôs list. The next two were the dodo, whose extinction was facilitated by the arrival of Dutch sailors, who brought various invasive species on their ships, and the thylacine, a marsupial with the face of a fox and the stripes of a zebra. (Tasmanian farmers did not like the thylacine‚Äôs appetite for their animals, so the government paid for its slaughter; the last one died in a zoo in Hobart in 1936.)</p><p>Reviving an extinct mammal, Lamm told me, is essentially a high-tech challenge: you have to hack the problem with advanced tools. You need to collect DNA-fragment samples, typically from bones, and then synthesize the information from those samples in an effort to reconstruct the animal‚Äôs genome, at least partly. After that, he said, ‚Äúwe need to create the right media to grow the cells. We need to do immortalization of the cells‚Äù‚Äîmodifying them to overcome their natural limit on division, thus allowing them to replicate indefinitely. Lamm became even more technical: ‚ÄúWe need to create induced pluripotent stem cells and see if we can use a process called gametogenesis to create eggs and sperm of those cells. And then, if we are successful in that, we‚Äôd need also to consider how to optimize genetic diversity.‚Äù The ultimate goal, he emphasized, was not to create a one-off specimen but to have the species reoccupy its former habitat.</p><p>I asked Lamm whether Tom Chi, one of Colossal‚Äôs first investors and a venture capitalist known for his environmental awareness, was putting his money in to help save the planet. ‚ÄúHe did not invest in us for fun,‚Äù Lamm said. ‚ÄúHe invested in us because he thinks this company could be dual purpose‚Äîwhere it has a positive ecological benefit <em>but</em> it makes a fuck ton of money.‚Äù</p><p>In 1984, researchers detected traces of mitochondrial DNA in the skin of a taxidermied quagga in a museum. It suddenly seemed possible to bring back species that had died out. At the least, the road map was becoming clearer. Even reviving dinosaurs appeared to be within reach when, a few years later, papers reported the presence of DNA fragments in the remains of ancient reptiles that had gone extinct eighty million years ago. These fossils all turned out to be contaminated with modern DNA‚Äîin some cases, the researchers had sampled traces of their own genetic material. DNA degrades over time, and scientists now believe that a usable sample probably can‚Äôt be obtained from fossils much older than a million years. These constraints weren‚Äôt yet known, though, when Michael Crichton published his 1990 science-fiction novel, ‚ÄúJurassic Park.‚Äù Lamm told me that, even now, one of the most frequent questions he gets is ‚ÄúAre you going to bring back the dinosaurs?‚Äù</p><p>In the nineties and two-thousands, researchers became better and better at extracting DNA, including from extremely small samples. In 2003, the human genome was sequenced‚ÄîChurch‚Äôs own DNA was the first to be publicly released. Numerous animal genomes followed. In 2012, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier developed <em>Crispr</em>, which relies on molecular machinery borrowed from bacteria to slice out genetic material from the nucleus of a cell and replace it with different genetic code. In 2014, the <em>Times</em> published its first article on the technology, declaring, ‚ÄúA genome can be edited, much as a writer might change words or fix spelling errors.‚Äù</p><p>Some scientists realized that <em>Crispr</em> could be used to insert a replica of an ancient DNA fragment into the cells of a closely related modern organism. The resulting hybrid creature might not be an exact copy of an extinct animal, but it could look very similar to the ancestor and thrive in the same ecosystem. Scientists soon found, however, that playing around with ancient DNA was harder than they expected. The samples they recovered were often damaged or impure; removing DNA from a fossilized bone sometimes damaged it further. Trying to accurately re-create an ancient genome involved looking at a modern cousin and estimating, by reverse engineering, which gene went where. Beth Shapiro, a noted ancient-DNA researcher who is now the chief science officer at Colossal, said, ‚ÄúWe have to figure out how to build a trillion-piece puzzle while working with pieces that were left outside during a hurricane, using the picture of a slightly different puzzle on the top of the box, and the contents of more than a hundred and fifty thousand different puzzles inside‚Äù‚Äîthat is, the DNA of all the microbes and fungi that got into the animal‚Äôs bone after it died.</p><p>In 2003, a group of European scientists tried to clone a recently extinct mammal called the bucardo, a mountain goat from the Pyrenees. The group used DNA that had been taken from the last living bucardo and then cryogenically frozen. They inserted the nuclei of bucardo cells into the eggs of fifty-seven goats, and then implanted them. Seven goats became pregnant; six had miscarriages, but one kid was born‚Äîwith a malformed lung. Ten minutes later, that kid died, making the bucardo the only species to have gone extinct twice.</p><p>While struggling with the science, researchers were also contending with ethical objections to such projects. What if an extinct species‚Äô original habitat was gone? Would you just be creating zoo animals? Was it immoral to alter an animal‚Äôs genome? Might concocted creatures suffer in unforeseen ways from the genetic changes? As with the bucardo, would you be allowing the same tragedy to occur a second time? In 2018, Shapiro, who was then running a lab at the University of California, Santa Cruz, made a striking remark to the <em>Wall Street Journal:</em> ‚ÄúThere is no point in bringing the dodo back. Their eggs will be eaten the same way that made them go extinct the first time.‚Äù</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Scientists such as Church were not daunted by the difficulty of the science or the ethical thickets involved. But in time they found a more persuasive framework for the de√´xtinction concept which moved it out of the realm of fringe science. They emphasized that revived woolly mammoths, dodos, and the like would not just be curios. These creatures had once played valuable roles in nature, and their absence had left gaps. Returning the missing animals to their original ecosystems would help bring their habitats back into balance. Colossal, alert to this reorientation, focussed its ambition on species reintroduction.</p><figure><p><span>Colossal‚Äôs focus is on reviving what are known as ‚Äúcharismatic megafauna‚Äù‚Äîanimals cute or scary or striking enough that their absence has left a significant mark on human consciousness. In addition to the dire-wolf project, the company has teams devoted to bringing back the woolly mammoth, the dodo, and the thylacine, a marsupial with the face of a fox and the stripes of a zebra.</span><span>Illustration by Armando Veve</span></p></figure><p>Scientists at the company decided to take inspiration not from ‚ÄúJurassic Park‚Äù but from recent ‚Äúrewilding‚Äù efforts. One project that they often cited was the reintroduction of the gray wolf to Yellowstone National Park, in the nineteen-nineties. Headlines at the time had focussed on how angry the return of wolves had made local ranchers‚Äîgray wolves occasionally kill livestock, just as thylacines did. But, ecologists noted, the absence of wolves had left elk with few natural predators, and their population had exploded; their overgrazing had decimated vegetation that had sustained beavers and birds. Once the wolves were reintroduced, the number of elk declined and the park regained its equilibrium.</p><p>In interviews and at public events, Church emphasized that the reintroduction of the woolly mammoth could bring similar benefits to Siberia. By trampling shrubs, the beasts would encourage the growth of grasses that are good at absorbing greenhouse gases. In the winter, the mammoths, with their enormous weight, would tamp down snow, trapping methane‚Äîa greenhouse gas‚Äîthat would otherwise be released by melting permafrost. Reviving the woolly mammoth, Church told CNBC in September, 2021, would bring Siberia ‚Äúback to what, from a human standpoint at least, was a healthier ecosystem.‚Äù</p><p>Shapiro again played the skeptic. She opposed the idea of de√´xtincting the woolly mammoth, arguing that creating one or two sample creatures would be cruel, given that they were likely highly social animals. She maintained that elephants do not do well in captivity or with assisted reproduction. And she insisted that elephants, instead of being impregnated with genetically edited embryos, ‚Äúshould be allowed to make more elephants.‚Äù</p><p>Shapiro is no longer Colossal‚Äôs gadfly. She started working with the company as an adviser in December, 2021, and became a full-time employee last year. Having pioneered techniques for the retrieval of ancient DNA and led a team at U.C. Santa Cruz that sequenced the dodo genome, she has a reputation in the world of genetics research that equals Church‚Äôs. But, if Church is de√´xtinction‚Äôs id, Shapiro is its superego. She has expressed wariness, publicly, of projects that seem exploitative or merely flashy. Lamm began courting Shapiro soon after Colossal was founded. By that point, she had secured a lucrative appointment as an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, so money wasn‚Äôt a strong lure. But she was impressed by how deeply he understood her work. He also caught her at a good time. She‚Äôd been instrumental in establishing the field of DNA recovery, and had won a MacArthur Fellowship, but, she told me, she was worried that her specialty had lost its Indiana Jones glamour and had become ‚Äúroutine‚Äîjust another application of evolutionary biology.‚Äù She had noted, with approval, Church‚Äôs shift away from de√´xtinction and toward rewilding, to creating ‚Äú<em>proxies</em> for these extinct species&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so they are useful in some way to the ecosystem.‚Äù In the spring of 2024, she signed on as the chief scientist for Colossal. ‚ÄúThe money is about the same, but I‚Äôm trading tenure for stock options,‚Äù she joked to me.</p><p>In February, Shapiro joined Lamm and three other Colossal scientists in a nondescript twenty-five-thousand-square-foot lab in the Dallas Market area. Two more researchers joined the meeting on Zoom. Lamm divides his staff according to the animal they are trying to revive: Michael Abrams is one of the heads of the woolly-mammoth team; Sara Ord leads the thylacine group; Anna Keyte is in charge of the dodo project. Shapiro supervises them all, on both scientific and ethical matters. Lamm explained to me that he ran his operation more like a tech startup than like a typical lab: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a healthy competition between the species leads.‚Äù</p><p>The woolly-mammoth group began the meeting. Abrams said that the team was about to publish a paper about some thirty mice that had been given genes to replicate the hair-growth patterns and cold-resistance capabilities of woolly mammoths. Trying out their research on mice was easier than doing so on elephants‚Äîfor one thing, the average gestation period for a mouse is three weeks, whereas an elephant‚Äôs is twenty-two months, the longest of any mammal. Abrams said that the paper‚Äîwhich documented ‚Äúa lot of really cool technology‚Äù‚Äîwould be posted online in two weeks, on a site that makes research studies public before they are peer-reviewed; Colossal would try to explain its techniques to other biologists at the same time that its publicity team lofted them into the news cycle. Of course, the paper might not be accepted by a peer-reviewed journal. Lamm was clearly comfortable with the arrangement.</p><p>Abrams‚Äôs colleague Austin Bow, who was on the Zoom screen, said that the mammoth group had just got their hands on a promising new fibroblast line ‚Äúderived from an Asian-elephant skin sample.‚Äù Fibroblast cells, which produce connective tissue, are crucial to gene editing and are easy to obtain. They can be stripped down to basic, flexible cells that can then be turned into any kind of cell in the body. A good fibroblast line maintains its genetic makeup over time even as it divides. The better the fibroblast line, the easier it would be to grow Asian-elephant cells that contained woolly-mammoth DNA and implant them in an embryo.</p><p>‚ÄúRocking the mammoth world here!‚Äù Shapiro said.</p><p>Ord, from the thylacine group, broke in with some news of her own. About a year earlier, the group, working in partnership with Australian researchers, had sequenced the animal‚Äôs DNA from a head preserved in ethanol at a museum in Melbourne. Colossal described it as the most complete sequencing ever done on an extinct nonhuman animal, mapping the thylacine‚Äôs genes with more than ninety-nine-per-cent accuracy. In October, 2024, Colossal announced that the group had successfully made three hundred edits to the DNA of a mouse-size marsupial called the fat-tailed dunnart, a living cousin of the thylacine with suction-cup ears and a ferocious appetite. The alterations would approximate aspects of the thylacine‚Äôs phenotype‚Äîthe observable characteristics of a creature. The team had also discovered how to induce ovulation in the dunnart. The next step was to transfer a nucleus with the edited DNA into a dunnart ovum. But this was proving challenging. The mechanics of marsupial reproduction are not well studied. The exterior membrane of a dunnart ovum, which is about 0.2 millimetres in diameter, turns out to be very difficult to penetrate, Ord explained. The team had even used lasers to try to pierce the tissue. The ovum was so tough that they initially thought the laser was defective, but when they focussed the beam on a mouse ovum it ‚Äújust blew up.‚Äù</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a60489&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a60489" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>‚ÄúWhat it lacks in flavor it makes up for in how much I made and don‚Äôt want to waste.‚Äù</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Sophie Lucido Johnson and Sammi Skolmoski</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>That‚Äôs when, Ord continued, a colleague on the team with a background in mosquito genetics suggested trying to penetrate the dunnart ovum with a probe made of quartz, which is one of the hardest minerals in existence. The probe worked. Ord showed a video of it piercing the wall of the cell. Everyone applauded. Now they could take the nucleus out of the ovum, insert the nucleus containing the thylacine genes, and watch an embryo grow.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>‚ÄúSpeaking of difficult challenges, what‚Äôs up with the birds?‚Äù Shapiro asked.</p><p>Keyte, the dodo director, reported that her group had been looking at the ninety thousand genetic differences between the dodo and its extant relatives, trying to map out which gene or genes were responsible for which characteristic. ‚ÄúI feel like a kid in a candy shop, because some of the genes that have come up on that are so cool,‚Äù she said enthusiastically. One bird whose DNA they had looked at was the Rodrigues solitaire‚Äîlike the dodo, a flightless bird that had lived on an island east of Madagascar. The solitaire went extinct at the end of the eighteenth century, roughly a century after the dodo. The two birds have closely related genomes; both are distant relatives of pigeons. ‚ÄúYou have a flighted bird that goes to an island, and it gets larger‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt need to fly anymore,‚Äù Keyte said. She had found a flight-related gene that had become inactive, giving the team a clue as to which of the genes in the dodo‚Äôs nearest living cousin, the Nicobar pigeon, they would need to alter to make Colossal‚Äôs avians earthbound, too.</p><p>Keyte added that her team was still a long way from bringing back the dodo. For one thing, the methods for growing and manipulating the embryonic precursors of avian sperm and eggs in a lab setting have been developed for only two birds: the chicken and, recently, the goose. Keyte said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been almost twenty years since culture conditions for the chicken were established, and those culture conditions have not worked for other bird species, even ones that are really closely related, like quail.‚Äù She added that, despite the dearth of related research, her team was getting better at growing the sperm-and-egg precursors in birds: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve gotten to the point where we feel like we can start doing some migration assays‚Äù‚Äîa technique for studying how the cells in an early embryo begin to differentiate. Once the researchers got the basic method for growing bird cells down, they could use the technology not just to develop a dodo but also to help replenish populations of endangered birds. The team had already identified some species that could use the help.</p><p>‚ÄúAwesome,‚Äù Shapiro said.</p><p>After the meeting ended, Lamm and I returned to his office. Colossal‚Äôs current lab space was just temporary‚Äînext door, the company was building a thirty-million-dollar state-of-the-art headquarters that is scheduled to open in June. Earlier, Lamm had walked me through the construction site, noting that the entrance would feature a ten-foot acrylic model of a woolly mammoth locked in simulated ice and shrouded in an emotive haze produced by a dry-ice machine. The model was being made by WƒìtƒÅ Workshop, the special-effects company that worked on the ‚ÄúLord of the Rings‚Äù films. Peter Jackson, the director of that franchise, has invested several million dollars in Colossal.</p><p>In Lamm‚Äôs office, a wilted T. rex-shaped helium balloon peered out from a corner. I noticed a copy of Church‚Äôs book on de√´xtinction, ‚ÄúRegenesis.‚Äù It ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt easy going,‚Äù Lamm told me. He gave me a book he loved, ‚ÄúThe Next 500 Years,‚Äù by Christopher E. Mason, a professor of genomics, physiology, and biophysics at Weill Cornell Medicine, in New York; it‚Äôs about how to biohack humans so that we can travel to distant planets.</p><p>Colossal‚Äôs roster of investors includes not only Jackson‚Äîwho told Lamm that the company‚Äôs work is as fun as making movies‚Äîbut also Paris Hilton. Image is very important to Lamm, who explained to me that his backers want to be associated with something exciting and sexy. He showed me some promotional videos that the company had made. These videos seemed to be pitched at the casually interested viewer‚Äîperhaps the sort of student he was as a young man‚Äîrather than at the ecological faithful. The voice-over in the videos, which nodded ironically to the steely voices of old-fashioned science documentaries, urged younger viewers to think of de√´xtinction technology as cool. One clip ended with a voice grab from HBO‚Äôs ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to the young wolf!‚Äù No one was going to confuse Colossal with the Sierra Club. The video, which showed the mechanics of de√´xtinction as if they were starships hitting hyperdrive, was made by the genre-film director Michael Dougherty. ‚ÄúMike did ‚ÄòGodzilla: King of the Monsters,‚Äô&nbsp;‚Äù Lamm said, with pride. ‚ÄúHe did ‚ÄòKrampus.‚Äô&nbsp;‚Äù</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>This sort of hype has made Colossal an object of wariness in the scientific community, which prizes rigor and transparency. Hank Greely, a Stanford Law School professor with an expertise in bioscience, told me, ‚ÄúI understand why businesses often want to avoid disclosing as much as a peer-reviewed publication might require,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúI know and like Beth Shapiro&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and trust her quite a bit.‚Äù Still, he concluded, he would be happier to see their data available for other scientists to evaluate.</p><p>To build bridges with conservationists, Colossal has partnered with dozens of environmental organizations and promises to share with them any new techniques it develops, free of charge. It has created a foundation to distribute spinoff technology and given it fifty million dollars in funding. Bringing Shapiro on board was an important part of this outreach effort. (The company currently employs a hundred and thirty-two scientists‚Äîa cohort larger than many university biology faculties. It also funds forty postdocs at other institutions.) Lamm has won over other important figures. Love Dal√©n, a top woolly-mammoth researcher and a professor of evolutionary genomics in Sweden, was at first put off by Colossal‚Äôs swagger, but he told me he became convinced that Lamm and his startup were ‚Äúdead serious at giving de√´xtinction the best shot they can.‚Äù He is now on Colossal‚Äôs board of scientific advisers. The money that the company has raised, he said, ‚Äúcould of course have been better spent in protection of habitat, getting rid of invasive species, and combatting poaching.‚Äù But, he noted, ‚Äúconservation funding is not a zero-sum game.‚Äù Lamm, Dal√©n felt, tapped funders who would not ordinarily give to, say, the World Wildlife Fund. The money invested in Colossal, he told me, would otherwise have gone to ‚Äúsome other tech companies, Bitcoin, the defense industry, or whatever.‚Äù And Colossal‚Äôs research is having valuable knock-on effects. Its work on woolly mammoths, Dal√©n said, is leading to a vaccine against elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus, which, by some estimates, accounts for up to two-thirds of Asian-elephant deaths in captivity and a significant number in the wild. Ideas for the design of the vaccine, which is in field trials, came about through Colossal‚Äôs experience with mRNA manipulation and its research on the elephant genome. Mammoths appear to have been susceptible to the virus, too. (Lamm told me, with typical immodesty, ‚ÄúIf successful, the vaccine will over time save more elephants than all of elephant conservation in history.‚Äù)</p><p>Lamm credits Elon Musk with stoking investors‚Äô appetites to do ‚Äúbigger things.‚Äù He adds, ‚ÄúI think people are, like, ‚ÄòWow, we can do big, crazy things <em>and</em> there is a chance that we get a return on them.‚Äô&nbsp;‚Äù So far, Lamm‚Äôs investors have no reason to question their support. A month before I visited Colossal, the startup had completed its fourth round of funding. This time, it raised two hundred million dollars, adding to the two hundred and thirty-five million it already had. The company‚Äôs current valuation is $10.2 billion‚Äîon par with Moderna, the vaccine company. (One person who might miss out on getting rich from Colossal is Church, who, during the initial steps of founding the company, opted for a direct investment in his Harvard lab rather than equity. He has no regrets. Referring to Lamm, he told <em>Forbes</em>, ‚ÄúThe fact that I‚Äôm not a billionaire is almost as interesting as Ben being one.‚Äù)</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Colossal has already birthed three startups. The first, Form Bio, is developing machine-learning technology that can help pinpoint the optimal cuts that <em>Crispr</em> can make while editing genes. This would have applications to, say, the attempt to treat genetic conditions such as sickle-cell anemia or Huntington‚Äôs disease, and also to drug discovery and development. The second startup, Breaking, is making use of the advances Colossal has made in gene manipulation to re√´ngineer X-32, a microorganism that naturally degrades plastics, to increase its efficacy. ‚ÄúIt takes plastics that have not broken down ever before and breaks them down in twenty-two months,‚Äù Lamm boasted. The third spinoff, he told me, was still ‚Äúin stealth mode,‚Äù and he would not talk about it.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28741&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28741" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs just fishing for a thank-you card.‚Äù</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Liana Finck</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>In truth, nearly everything Colossal is doing could find for-profit uses, since the attempt to genetically engineer, implant, gestate, and then birth an extinct animal touches on so many common health challenges. Currently, once the company has an embryo ready to grow, researchers insert it in a host animal, but such surrogates are limited in number and expensive to work with, and come with many potential health complications. Birth can also be traumatic‚Äîelephants rarely survive a Cesarean section, which is how many animals gestated in surrogates are born. So the company is working to replace the surrogates it would use‚Äîthe Asian elephant for the woolly mammoth, for example‚Äîwith artificial wombs. Lamm said, ‚ÄúWe call it an exo-dev‚Äù‚Äîfor ‚Äúexogenous development‚Äù‚Äî‚Äúbecause it sounds less creepy.‚Äù (It didn‚Äôt.) Such technology could revolutionize human surrogate births, removing the ethical and emotional complications of the practice, not to mention the risks of pregnancy. ‚ÄúThat field alone is a hundred-billion-dollar spinoff,‚Äù Lamm told me. An unaffiliated investment-advisory firm, Brownstone Research, has estimated that the ‚Äúaddressable market‚Äù for an exo-dev system for humans would be worth at least twenty billion dollars.</p><p>There is even money to be made in de√´xtinction itself. While we were in Lamm‚Äôs office, he pulled up a slide titled ‚ÄúRewilding: Monetization,‚Äù which showed a sketch of woolly mammoths in a chilly mountainous landscape. It was easy to imagine tourists gawking at the site.</p><p>‚ÄúJurassic Park!‚Äù I said.</p><p>‚ÄúNo, no, no, no, no,‚Äù Lamm responded. ‚ÄúThat was an exaggerated zoo. This is letting the animals <em>live</em> in their natural habitats.‚Äù The distinction wasn‚Äôt entirely obvious to me, but I let him continue.</p><p>He explained that I was looking at a plan for a restored ecosystem. It was also a perfectly adapted money machine. There was a large area where the ancient elephants could graze, and this would be funded, in part, by carbon-offset payments from governments and corporations. The carbon value of a single elephant is about two million dollars, he told me. (An elephant increases biodiversity, in part, by spreading seeds in its dung and by crushing dense vegetation on forest floors, giving slow-growing trees the space to survive.) He added that the interesting educational opportunities and ‚Äúsexiness factor‚Äù of Colossal‚Äôs creations would make its carbon credits ‚Äútrade at a premium.‚Äù Rewilding could also provide value for nations that host revived animals. Shapiro had told me that when she visited Mauritius, where the dodo once lived, officials expressed enthusiasm about the prospect of increasing ecotourism. Lamm said, ‚ÄúIf we are increasing the G.D.P. from tourism because of dodos, then we should partake in that.‚Äù</p><p>What about selling Colossal-created animals as pets? ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not in that business,‚Äù Lamm told me, adding, ‚ÄúI think you know us better than to even ask this.‚Äù</p><p>It was nearly time to see Colossal‚Äôs dire wolves. Since I was first shown the image of the two pups, I‚Äôd been told that a third had been born. She was equally cute. I‚Äôd also seen a photograph of one of the pups in the arms of George R.&nbsp;R. Martin, the author whose books were the basis of the ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù series, in which dire wolves feature prominently. ‚ÄúI used to watch the show, and I didn‚Äôt even think dire wolves were real,‚Äù Lamm told me. The entire dire-wolf operation had been done in stealth mode, and everyone involved had to sign nondisclosure agreements, including Martin.</p><p>Before making my travel plans, I spoke with Colossal‚Äôs chief animal officer, Matt James, who was low-key and modest compared with his voluble colleagues. ‚ÄúI just play with animals, mostly,‚Äù he explained. He said that he had recently been at an enclosure where Colossal had birthed four cloned red wolves‚Äîan animal that, despite being protected under the Endangered Species Act, was becoming rarer and rarer in the wild. As far as he knew, these pups were the first cloned red wolves ever. He added that, for the cloning process, Colossal scientists had used a new procedure that was less stressful for the genetic-donor animal. Usually, a biopsy is required to get clonable cells, but the scientists had figured out a way to obtain them merely by drawing blood. The new technique had been perfected by the dire-wolf team.</p><p>In ‚ÄúGame of Thrones,‚Äù the dire wolves are as big as lions. In reality, the dire wolf probably weighed about a hundred and fifty pounds, and it was only somewhat larger than today‚Äôs gray wolf. It also had more powerful jaws and a bigger head than a gray wolf. Dire wolves became extinct some twelve thousand years ago, at the end of the age of giant mammals. Most likely, their vanishing was not the result of direct contact with humans but, rather, was caused by the depletion of the large animals that were key to their diet. Dire wolves mostly ate horses and bison, with occasional forays into giant sloths and baby mammoths.</p><p>I was curious about how the dire wolf had slipped onto Colossal‚Äôs agenda, which was so clearly focussed on the three other extinct animals. Given Lamm‚Äôs alpha personality, it seemed possible that he simply wanted Colossal to dominate the de√´xtinction space: it had begun with three animals, but why not four? Or perhaps the company, having made huge promises, felt the need to give concrete proof that it was making progress. According to James, the woolly mammoth‚Äôs due date had slipped from 2026 to 2028 after he pointed out the elephant‚Äôs long gestation period and other reproductive challenges. (Lamm says that Colossal is on track for 2028.)</p><p>Questions about Colossal‚Äôs timetables were evidently sensitive. During a tour of the lab with Lamm and the various species heads, I was escorted from workstation to workstation, so that I could better understand the high-tech genetic manipulations that would make the regenerated animals. It felt as if we were in the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre in ‚ÄúBrave New World.‚Äù I asked Ord, the thylacine-team head, and Keyte, the dodo-team leader, when their animals would be resurrected.</p><p>‚ÄúThis decade,‚Äù Ord told me.</p><p>‚ÄúThe dodo is on track for this decade as well!‚Äù Keyte answered, competitively.</p><p>‚Äú<em>No dates</em>,‚Äù Lamm shot back.</p><p>As for the dire wolf, Lamm told me that the decision to put it at the front of the line was not because the company was impatient with its difficult marquee projects. In 2023, at a two-day conference with the team heads and Colossal‚Äôs advisory-board scientists, the attendees had whiteboarded what other animals might fit their guidelines for de√´xtinction, and the dire wolf had generated a lot of enthusiasm. Lamm said that he had recently been visiting with people from Indigenous tribes, and many spoke of missing wolves, which had been central to their cultures. ‚ÄúThere was this desire to bring back what they called the Great Wolf,‚Äù he claimed. Another reason‚Äî‚Äúand this is <em>really</em> important,‚Äù Lamm said‚Äîwas that dire wolves are top-line talent in pop culture. They aren‚Äôt just in ‚ÄúGame of Thrones.‚Äù Dire wolves have starring roles in the video game World of Warcraft, the collectible-card game Magic: The Gathering, and the role-playing game Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Lamm added that the Grateful Dead even have a song called ‚ÄúDire Wolf.‚Äù</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Colossal scientists began working on birthing a dire wolf in the summer of 2023. As I suspected, they were confident that the process would go faster than it was going with mammoths, dodos, and thylacines, in part because the genetics of dogs are among the best known of any nonhuman mammal. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because people want to sequence their dogs and then talk about them,‚Äù Shapiro explained to me. Still, dogs and wolves split from each other some fifteen thousand years ago, and their genes have diverged over that time. ‚ÄúWe had to develop a lot of resources for wolves, because they hadn‚Äôt been invented yet,‚Äù Shapiro said. ‚ÄúHow to keep wolf cells healthy in culture, what to edit, et cetera. It‚Äôs still easier than a mammoth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it‚Äôs orders of magnitude harder than a mouse.‚Äù Colossal hired experts in cell editing and wolf embryology and behavior.</p><p>The first problem the group encountered was where to get dire-wolf DNA good enough to use in sequencing the extinct animal‚Äôs genes. Shapiro happened to know as much about the topic as anyone in the world‚Äîin 2021, she had co-written a paper that traced the dire wolf‚Äôs lineage by using recovered DNA. While doing that research, she had examined the available dire-wolf fossils and found very little genetic material in them. But sampling techniques had grown more sensitive in the intervening years, and she decided to revisit the fossils. Two proved particularly useful. One was a piece of a dire-wolf tooth from Sheriden Cave, a late-Ice Age fossil pit in Ohio; the tooth was thought to be about thirteen thousand years old. The second candidate was a nearly complete skull from Idaho, found at the American Falls Reservoir. The skull was estimated to be more than seventy thousand years old, but contained an intact petrous‚Äîan inner-ear bone whose cells are densely packed, an arrangement that inhibits the entry of fungi and microorganisms that destroy DNA.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Because ancient-DNA reconstruction involves removing a small piece of bone, it puts delicate fossils at risk. Institutions aren‚Äôt always eager to oblige. But Shapiro had the clout to get the tooth shipped to her lab in Santa Cruz, and she sent one of her students to the museum in Idaho where the skull was kept. Nevertheless, she was nervous to begin drilling. Lamm reassured her: ‚ÄúBeth, you‚Äôre the No. 1 person in ancient DNA. I‚Äôm confident that you can do this. Like, you‚Äôve done this a thousand times.‚Äù She used a dentist‚Äôs drill to make a small hole in the tooth and extracted powder containing billions of fragments of DNA. She then tagged each strand in such a way that a DNA-sequencing machine could read the order of the nucleotides‚Äîadenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C)‚Äîwell enough to provide a blueprint for engineering new cell lines. Lamm told me that the ‚ÄúEureka moment‚Äù arrived when Colossal scientists realized that they would be able to establish much of the dire-wolf genome.(They ended up at ninety-one per cent.) Such efforts are never perfect. ‚ÄúThere are errors in every genome that‚Äôs been assembled,‚Äù Shapiro pointed out.</p><p>The group then compared the DNA of the dire wolves with DNA sequences from gray-wolf cell lines. The gray wolf is the dire wolf‚Äôs closest living relative‚Äîthey share 99.5 per cent of their DNA. If a gene does something in the gray wolf, the same gene in dire-wolf DNA likely codes for the same trait. The scientists‚Äô goal was to alter the gray-wolf genome in ways that might make the resulting creature more like a dire wolf: principally, larger, with an increased head size and fluffy, light-colored fur.</p><p>The scientists could tell, based on the variation in key pigmentation genes, that dire wolves‚Äîlike Ghost in ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù‚Äîhad very pale coats. But the genes that guided coat color presented a problem: they carried with them a risk of blindness and deafness. (In humans, variations of these genes can lead to Waardenburg syndrome, which causes pigmentation deficiencies, among other problems.) So the group decided to edit a different gene that, when expressed in dogs, also codes for a lighter coat. This might make the dire wolf less authentic, but it would be better for the new creatures. ‚ÄúOtherwise, this animal is going to live out a suboptimal life because of choices <em>you made</em>,‚Äù Lamm pointed out. After almost a year of computational genetic analysis, Colossal researchers used <em>Crispr</em> to make twenty edits on fourteen genes. Fifteen edits were derived from Colossal‚Äôs study of the dire-wolf genome and five tweaks were derived from scrutiny of the gray-wolf genome. A Colossal-affiliated scientist spoke to me at length about which specific genes were altered, but the discussion was off the record, at the insistence of Lamm, who called such details the ‚Äúcompany‚Äôs I.P.‚Äù</p><p>By mid-2024, Colossal researchers were watching thousands of edited cell lines grow in petri dishes stored inside incubators. Several cell lines stopped growing‚Äîperhaps because <em>Crispr</em> had mistakenly removed a bit of DNA or added code in the wrong place, or because the cell lines had other defects, or because they simply weren‚Äôt vigorous enough to keep dividing. By late summer, nuclei containing the edited genome were inserted into dog ova whose DNA had been removed. Forty-five embryos were placed inside two dogs. ‚ÄúMutts, like a hound mix,‚Äù Lamm said. (Among other things, dog breeding is better understood than that of wolves.)</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Only two embryos‚Äîone in each surrogate mother‚Äîgrew to term. The gestation period was about sixty days, similar to that of gray wolves. The pregnant dogs were kept under supervision at a secure animal center and given weekly ultrasounds, starting about halfway through their term, to insure that the fetuses were growing normally. Lamm remembers ‚Äúa chronic level of stress and anxiety knowing we were breaking new ground every day.‚Äù</p><p>On October 1, 2024, veterinarians‚Äîwho had also signed N.D.A.s‚Äîdelivered the pups, by Cesarean section. The team had hoped for vaginal births, James said, but as the weeks went on ‚Äúthere was a concern that there would be a size mismatch‚Äù‚Äîthat the dire-wolf babies could be too big. When the pups were born, Lamm and Shapiro had just arrived in London for the premi√®re of a movie on ancient DNA. Lamm, whose first child had been born five months earlier, watched the dire-wolf births on FaceTime as James trained his phone on the operating table. The pups were large (one of them, James told me, was twice the normal weight of a gray wolf at birth) and white (gray wolves are born with very dark coats), with unusually robust heads. The pups were whining and crying. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm holding the first dire-wolf cubs in twelve thousand years,‚Äù James pronounced, adding, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sort of surreal.‚Äù</p><p>For the first few days, the dire-wolf pups nursed on one of the dog moms, but, according to James, the mother ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt able to keep up with their metabolic needs,‚Äù and they were switched to bottles. The two mutts were soon adopted by families, through the American Humane Society, without any mention of their role in lupine history. Lamm told me that he is very proud of how quickly the project came to fruition: ‚ÄúWithin eighteen months of our putting the name ‚Äòdire wolf‚Äô down on a whiteboard, we birthed dire wolves!‚Äù</p><p>I asked Lamm when a university lab would have completed a comparable effort.</p><p>‚ÄúNever,‚Äù he replied.</p><p>On March 25th, I went to meet the two older pups, named Romulus and Remus. (The third pup, named Khaleesi‚Äîfor the light-haired protagonist of ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù‚Äîwas not yet ready for visitors, I was told.) I was given directions to a one-acre enclosure at a location in the northern U.S. The dire wolves normally live on a two-thousand-acre property far from the spot where I was headed. ‚ÄúThey live like kings there,‚Äù Lamm told me. As I drove up to the enclosure, I saw Church, looking like Gandalf, with a bushy white beard, and Lamm, who, with his luxuriant, glossy facial hair, resembles Jon Snow, Ghost‚Äôs master. Matt James was present, and a phalanx of animal-care officers stood in a corner, in case there were problems.</p><p>I suddenly saw two shocks of white‚Äîthe young dire wolves. Both attentive and wary, the animals seemed not from this world. They were impressively large: roughly eighty pounds apiece, at five months old. Lamm told me that they would likely weigh about a hundred and forty pounds at maturity‚Äîat least twenty pounds more than a large adult male gray wolf.</p><p>James said, of the pups, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to tell their girth, because they‚Äôre so hairy.‚Äù</p><p>Church recalled when he could almost hold a pup in each hand‚Äîhe‚Äôd seen them twelve weeks after their birth.</p><p>Much of the dire wolves‚Äô behavior reminded me of dogs‚Äô. Romulus and Remus rested on their haunches in the sun. They chased falling leaves; they chewed sticks. One peed, and the other hurried over to roll in it. Other aspects seemed wolflike‚Äîwhen Romulus got nervous, he did a sideways slide while facing us. (James explained to me that this maneuver is a way to both check out a threat and look as large as possible.) And, when the wolves ran, they loped as if their lower legs had an extra joint. They didn‚Äôt howl, and their footfalls were silent. Was this distinctive dire-wolf behavior? How could anyone say?</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26637&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26637" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>‚ÄúYour name doesn‚Äôt happen to be Pam, does it?

Remus was braver. He would come up within ten feet of us, then think better of it. Romulus hung back. They both gave off a sense of biding their time; since nothing formidable had yet been asked of them, they had done nothing formidable. But they could; their bodies were clearly powerful. At one point, Remus seemed interested in getting behind us‚Äîhe stopped when James looked at him‚Äîand I was reminded of the legend on the Dire Wolves card in Magic: The Gathering: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs amazing how scared a city kid can get at a dog.‚Äù I was told to keep a respectful distance. Lamm, though, seemed unafraid. ‚ÄúI pet Remus last week,‚Äù he said proudly. ‚ÄúBut, you know, that‚Äôs because I‚Äôve been around them forever.‚Äù (James says that around the time they enter puberty‚Äîat roughly a year old‚Äîthey will likely be deemed too aggressive to be petted ever again. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre about to hit a trigger point,‚Äù he said.)</p><p>Church was eagerly looking for signs that the molecular engineering had done more than make Colossal‚Äôs wolves large and fluffy. The team had targeted an enhancer sequence that could produce the dire wolf‚Äôs pronounced muzzle and ears. James explained that cranial attributes take a while to develop. ‚ÄúI can hardly wait for the annual checkup,‚Äù Church said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where we‚Äôre going to learn, you know, where these phenotypes really distinguish them from the gray wolf.‚Äù</p><p>James said that Church would get his chance when the pups had full CT scans this fall, after turning one. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôll give us an opportunity to really look at musculoskeletal changes,‚Äù he said. Meanwhile, Lamm took more of a horse-breeder‚Äôs approach. The two wolves began to lope, then briefly run. ‚ÄúWatch! Watch the fur, watch the thickness,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou can see the musculature in the sun. Do you see it‚Äîshoulders? Side? Back? That‚Äôs not typical.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúAnd the way the wind ruffles them,‚Äù Church added. ‚ÄúThere we go. Watch the fur!‚Äù</p><p>Mike Dougherty had made a video for Colossal to proclaim the dire wolves‚Äô birth. A voice declared, ‚ÄúWe are pleased to announce that, for the first time ever in history, we have successfully resurrected a prehistoric pop-culture icon.‚Äù The dire wolves also got a boost from the Trump Administration. The Department of the Interior had sent Colossal a draft statement heralding the births as proof that ‚Äúinnovation‚Äînot regulation‚Äîhad spawned American greatness.‚Äù</p><p>After seeing the wolves, though, I wondered how many people would accept that what I had just seen was a resurrection. Romulus and Remus embodied a lot of breakthroughs. No one else, Colossal said, had ever made so many precision edits to an animal genome at once. Nobody had ever birthed a mammal that had ancient DNA in it. ‚ÄúThis is the first time these genes have been expressed in over ten thousand years,‚Äù Lamm pointed out. But to what extent were the pups dire wolves‚Äîas opposed to, say, gray wolves with some of the dire wolf‚Äôs physical traits? Did they act like dire wolves? No effort had been made to try to identify genes for behavior. Did they think or smell or sound like the extinct animals? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not possible to bring back something exactly the way it was,‚Äù Shapiro told me, several times. That was a childish goal of the sort that had led her to challenge de√´xtinction for so many years. She pointed out that, even within species, there was genetic variability, and environment and nongenetic factors alter living organisms. You had only to look at Romulus‚Äôs and Remus‚Äôs different personalities.</p><p>I spoke to Elinor Karlsson, a program director at the Broad Institute, a joint Harvard and M.I.T. facility. An expert on wolf and dog genetics, she is a member of Colossal‚Äôs advisory board. But she told me that she has some doubts about the company‚Äôs messaging: ‚ÄúI ask Beth, ‚ÄòWhy are you calling this a dire wolf when it‚Äôs a gray wolf with seventeen or eighteen changes in its DNA?‚Äô&nbsp;‚Äù Shapiro has countered that she did what she set out to do: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve succeeded in creating the <em>phenotype</em> of a dire wolf.‚Äù</p><p>This battle over definition had gone through a trial run just a few weeks earlier. Colossal had announced the existence of the ‚Äúwoolly mouse‚Äù that Abrams had spoken about at the species-lead meeting. The story was picked up everywhere‚Äîthere were five billion media impressions in two weeks, Lamm told me. John Oliver and ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù each played off it. (Colin Jost: ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs on to step two‚Äîgetting it drunk enough to have sex with an elephant.‚Äù) <em>Mashable</em> wrote that scientists had ‚Äúaccidentally created the cutest mice in the world.‚Äù</p><p>Science journalists were more cautious. They took issue with the fact that Colossal had used analogous genes from mice, not woolly-mammoth DNA, to achieve the effect of long, thick hair. A professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Buffalo did tell the Associated Press that the work was ‚Äútechnologically pretty cool.‚Äù But <em>Nature</em> noted that a Maine research facility has been offering its own long-haired mouse strain, named Wooly, for sale to scientists for the past twenty years.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Lamm was irritated when I mentioned the response to him. ‚ÄúWe are the most advanced multicellular-synthetic-biology company on the planet,‚Äù he told me. The science behind the woolly mouse had been extraordinary, he reiterated‚Äîresearchers had successfully made multiple gene edits on a living organism at the same time, a precursor to the quadruple-axel gene editing used in re-creating the dire wolf. ‚ÄúIt was the most unique germ-line edit in any animal to date,‚Äù he said.</p><p>I asked Lamm if perhaps some overpromising by the Colossal brand had tamped down the applause. The word ‚Äúde-extinction‚Äù appears nearly five hundred times on the company‚Äôs website; ordinary people could be excused for thinking that the word referred to creating an exact genetic replica of a once alive animal. Lamm responded, ‚ÄúI was warned when I started this business that some of the scientific community will be, if we are successful, jealous and somewhat frustrated.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúYou would think spending half a billion on de√´xtinction and conservation would get them excited.‚Äù</p><p>Shapiro was more philosophical: ‚ÄúThe pushback that we‚Äôre going to get from everybody is that it is not a hundred per cent of the way to the dire wolf. But we want to say with confidence that we‚Äôve done this <em>functional</em> de√´xtinction, and I think we have.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúYou know, as a scientist, would I have wanted to add another hundred million edits to the genome, to see what happened? Maybe‚ÄîI mean, I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù</p><p>Church, for his part, is still hoping for a day when an entire extinct-mammal genome can be synthesized. Building a complete genome would likely be vastly harder than sequencing one and then synthesizing only small portions of it, but Church thinks that it‚Äôs technically possible. If you had the whole genome of an animal, and you inserted it into an egg, you would essentially be re-creating an individual from that extinct species. He has run the numbers. He told me, ‚ÄúThe world has successfully synthesized a yeast genome, which is twelve million base pairs‚Äù‚Äîthe fundamental units of DNA. The woolly mammoth had approximately three billion base pairs. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only two-hundred-fiftyfold away!‚Äù he calculated. But Karlsson cautioned me, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre extremely far away from that goal now.‚Äù Lamm, not shy about big projects, said that filling in every gap in an extinct animal‚Äôs genome was ‚Äúa cold-fusion-level problem.‚Äù He added that the difference between using a whole genome and using computational genetics to approximate the useful portions of a genome is ‚Äúan academic distinction‚Äîwhich is probably why it interests George Church.‚Äù</p><p>Until the genome synthesis of mammals becomes a reality, Colossal‚Äôs dire wolf may be the closest we can come to the resurrection of charismatic megafauna. Lamm says that Romulus, Remus, and Khaleesi will not be allowed to breed; moreover, the company anticipates genetically engineering just three to five more of the animals. They will be kept on their preserve, protected by a ten-foot-high security fence and surveilled by drones‚Äîand visited, one suspects, only by the occasional billionaire. Colossal‚Äôs wolves are now at the age when their parents would teach them to hunt, but of course they have no parents; in fact, they have never seen other wolves. (There are some deer and squirrels on their two-thousand-acre plot, but that‚Äôs about it for other animals.) Perhaps a decade or so from now, when the wolves die‚Äînature cares for nothing, all shall go‚Äîthis genetic-engineering moon shot may, like the real moon shot, be remembered as much for the amazing new technologies it throws off as for the goal in itself. And the dire wolf may have the distinction, after the poor bucardo, of being the second species brought back to life only to die again.&nbsp;‚ô¶</p><p><em>An earlier version of this article misstated the current stage of research on using Asian elephants as surrogates for woolly mammoths.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>I‚Äôm new to Substack‚Äîthis is my first post.</p><p>Hey, I‚Äôm Matt. I founded Vizzly as a first-time entrepreneur and exited in under three years, selling the company to WPP, the world‚Äôs largest advertising organization. A few months after starting the company, we were accepted into Y-Combinator, and I spent about four months engrossed in San Francisco‚Äôs tech hustle culture learning from people much smarter than I. I‚Äôm not anti-SF (far from it; I have some incredible memories there), but I didn‚Äôt buy into the all-or-nothing mindset of startups. </p><p>It‚Äôs worth noting that after Demo Day, we set out to raise more than we ended up with‚Äîessentially, a failed Seed round. At the time, I saw this as a negative, assuming fundraising was a form of validation (turns out it‚Äôs not, by the way).</p><p>A year later, I came to realize that this was the best thing to happen to both the company and myself. For starters, it forced us to become very revenue-centric.</p><p>Additionally, it opened the door to smaller acquisitions. Because our preference stack (more on this later) was tiny, even a relatively small deal would produce a life-changing outcome for the founding team.</p><p>Writing this, I could go in a million directions‚Äîand I probably will in future posts, diving into different aspects. For now, I‚Äôll focus on the 'missing middle path.'</p><p>On my LinkedIn feed, it feels like there are two dominant narratives in B2B SaaS: the VC path‚Äîgo big or go home, maybe take a secondary at Series A or B, but push hard no matter what‚Äîor the Bootstrapper route‚Äîbuild sustainable value with an asset you own on a shoestring budget, and reap the rewards of cash flow and dividends.</p><p>What‚Äôs rarely talked about is the third path: raise a small amount‚Äîsay, less than $1M‚Äîwhile keeping 90%+ of your equity, avoiding board seats, and building for profitability and strong asset value. All without draining your personal finances or spending a decade bootstrapping through revenue.</p><p>The reason it‚Äôs not more popular is that it‚Äôs a founder-centric approach that doesn‚Äôt fit the venture capital model, making it a controversial stance. In fact, if you pitched this pathway to a VC, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd ghost you quicker than their last Hinge date.</p><p>In short: the top 3% of investments are expected to return the fund and more. So, if you're aiming for a $10M outcome, they won‚Äôt be interested. Success and returns often increase with more funding, which is why VCs push for constant fundraising. With a preference stack, they get paid back first, leaving you effectively in debt. This forces you to scale to justify the time and effort needed to generate a meaningful outcome.</p><p><span>For those wondering what a preference stack is, it‚Äôs basically the order in which different investors get paid when a startup is sold or liquidated. You might see a headline in </span><em>TechCrunch</em><span> saying a startup has sold for $40M. For all you know, they raised $30M, grinded for eight years, and the deal is 10% cash and 90% equity exchange‚Äîmeaning the founders involved (assume there are two) are basically exchanging overinflated equity that will probably be subject to a four-year vest. </span></p><p><span>This is obviously a hypothetical and a great outcome based on the probability of a startup's success, but it‚Äôs still a pretty modest outcome if you think that‚Äôs 12 years of prime life one would have sacrificed (sorry, </span><em>invested</em><span>).</span></p><p>I have an incredible amount of admiration for folks on the venture journey ‚Äì it‚Äôs high risk, high reward, as I do for folks who bootstrap and pursue a more unconventional route. The problem with bootstrapping is simple: not everyone can sustain it.</p><p>Many bootstrapped B2B SaaS startups were agencies beforehand, such as Mailchimp, Basecamp, Lemlist, etc. I probably don‚Äôt need to labor this point too much, but this pathway can also take a really long time to create and drive value.</p><p>Of course it‚Äôs subjective, but I think the middle path provides the optimal combination of return size, time to return, all with minimal financial risk to the founders involved. For most B2B SaaS businesses, you shouldn‚Äôt need more than $1M in capital to get to PMF, find a GTM motion that works (not that it needs to scale), and reach an ARR figure where the revenue multiple for valuation starts to look pretty tasty‚Äîenough to offer significant upside even after investors are paid out.</p><p>What no VC will tell you is that there‚Äôs a window of opportunity ‚Äî somewhere between Pre-Seed and Series A ‚Äî where founders can tap into significant upside. This is rarely discussed, and too many companies fail because they raise too much, only to end up with little to nothing in a liquidation event (as described above).</p><p>We stumbled into the middle path, and I‚Äôm grateful for it.</p><p>There are still drawbacks and important factors to consider‚Äîparticularly how you choose to source your investment. While most VCs may not align with this philosophy, angel investors are generally more open to a 2-3x ROI.</p><p>As with everything, there are trade-offs. The key is understanding your values, defining what you want from the journey and the outcome, and knowing what you're willing‚Äîand, more importantly, unwilling‚Äîto sacrifice along the way.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/04/07/writing-c-for-curl/">https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/04/07/writing-c-for-curl/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43608551">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It is a somewhat common question to me: how do we write C in <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a> <em>to make it safe and secure for billions of installations</em>? Some precautions we take and decisions we make. There is no silver bullet, just guidelines. As I think you can see for yourself below they are also neither strange nor surprising.</p>



<p>The ‚Äòc‚Äô in curl does not and never did stand for the C programming language, it stands for <em>client</em>.</p>



<h2>Disclaimer</h2>



<p><strong>This text does in no way mean that we don‚Äôt occasionally merge security related bugs.</strong> We do. We are human. We do mistakes. Then we fix them.</p>



<h2>Testing</h2>



<p>We write as many tests as we can. We run all the static code analyzer tools we can on the code ‚Äì frequently. We run fuzzers on the code non-stop.</p>



<h2>C is not memory-safe</h2>



<p>We are certainly not immune to memory related bugs, mistakes or vulnerabilities. We count about 40% of our security vulnerabilities to date to have been the direct result of us using C instead of a memory-safe language alternative. This is however a much lower number than the 60-70% that are commonly repeated, originating from a few big companies and projects. If this is because of a difference in counting or us actually having a lower amount of C problems, I cannot tell.</p>



<p>Over the last five years, we have received <strong>no</strong> reports identifying a <em>critical</em> vulnerability and only two of them were rated at severity <em>high</em>. The rest ( 60 something) have been at severity <em>low</em> or <em>medium</em>.</p>



<p>We currently have close to 180,000 lines of C89 production code (excluding blank lines). We stick to C89 for widest possible portability and because we believe in continuous non-stop iterating and polishing and never rewriting.</p>



<h2>Readability</h2>



<p>Code should be easy to read. It should be clear. No hiding code under clever constructs, fancy macros or overloading. Easy-to-read code is easy to review, easy to debug and easy to extend.</p>



<p>Smaller functions are easier to read and understand than longer ones, thus preferable.</p>



<p>Code should read as if it was written by a single human. There should be a consistent and uniform code style all over, as that helps us read code better. Wrong or inconsistent code style is a bug. We fix all bugs we find.</p>



<p>We have tooling that verify basic code style compliance.</p>



<h2>Narrow code and short names</h2>



<p>Code should be written narrow. It is hard on the eyes to read long lines, so we enforce a strict 80 column maximum line length. We use two-spaces indents to still allow us to do some amount of indent levels before the column limit becomes a problem. If the indent level becomes a problem, maybe it should be split up in several sub-functions instead?</p>



<p>Also related: (in particular local) identifiers and names should be short. Having long names make them hard to read, especially if there are multiple ones that are similar. Not to mention that they can get hard to fit within 80 columns after some amount of indents.</p>



<p>So many people will now joke and say something about wide screens being available and what not but the key here is readability. Wider code is harder to read. Period. The question could possibly be exactly where to draw the limit, and that‚Äôs a debate for every project to have.</p>



<h2>Warning-free</h2>



<p>While it should be natural to everyone already, we of course build all curl code entirely without any compiler warning in any of the 220+ CI jobs we perform. We build curl with all the most picky compiler options that exist with the set of compilers we use, and we silence every warning that appear. We treat every compiler warning as an error.</p>



<h2>Avoid ‚Äúbad‚Äù functions</h2>



<p>There are some C functions that are just plain bad because of their lack of boundary controls or local state and we avoid them (gets, sprintf, strcat, strtok, localtime, etc).</p>



<p>There are some C functions that are complicated in other ways. They have too open ended functionality or do things that often end up problematic or just plain wrong; they easily lead us into doing mistakes. We avoid sscanf and strncpy for those reasons.</p>



<p>We have tooling that <em>bans</em> the use of these functions in our code. Trying to introduce  use of one of them in a pull request causes CI jobs to turn red and alert the author about their mistake.</p>



<h2>Buffer functions</h2>



<p>Years ago we found ourselves having done several mistakes in code that were dealing with different dynamic buffers. We had too many separate implementations working on dynamically growing memory areas. We unified this handling with a new set of internal help functions for growing buffers and now made sure we only use these. This drastically reduces the need for realloc(), which helps us avoid mistakes related to that function.</p>



<p>Each dynamic buffer also has its own maximum size set, which in its simplicity also helps catching mistakes. In the current libcurl code, we have 80 something different <em>dynamic buffers</em>.</p>



<h2>Parsing functions</h2>



<p>I mentioned how we don‚Äôt like sscanf. It is a powerful function for parsing, but it often ends up parsing more than what the user wants (for example more than one space even if only one should be accepted) and it has weak (non-existing) handling of integer overflows. Lastly, it steers users into copying parsed results around unnecessarily, leading to superfluous uses of local stack buffers or short-lived heap allocations.</p>



<p>Instead we introduced another set of helper functions for string parsing, and over time we switch all parser code in curl over to using this set. It makes it easier to write strict parsers that only match exactly what we want them to match, avoid extra copies/mallocs and it does strict integer overflow and boundary checks better.</p>



<h2>Monitor memory function use</h2>



<p>Memory problems often involve a dynamic memory allocation followed by a copy of data into the allocated memory area. Or perhaps, if the allocation and the copy are both done correctly there is no problem but if either of them are wrong things can go bad. Therefor we aim toward minimizing that pattern. We rather favor strdup and memory duplication that allocates and copies data in the same call ‚Äì or uses of the helper functions that may do these things behind their APIs. We run a daily updated graph in the curl dashboard that shows <em>memory function call density</em> in curl. Ideally, this plot will keep falling over time.</p>


<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;67f3d35b50110&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" width="3066" height="1726" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-06-at-13-01-34-curl-Project-status-dashboard.png" alt=""><figcaption>Memory function call density in curl production code over time</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>It can perhaps also be added that we avoid superfluous memory allocations, in particular in hot paths. A large download does not need any more allocations than a small one.</p>



<h2>Double-check multiplications</h2>



<p>Integer overflows is another area for concern. Every arithmetic operation done needs to be done with a certainty that it does not overflow. This is unfortunately still mostly a manual labor, left for human reviews to detect.</p>



<h2>64-bit support guaranteed</h2>



<p>In early 2023 we dropped support for building curl on systems without a functional 64-bit integer type. This simplifies a lot of code and logic. Integer overflows are less likely to trigger and there is no risk that authors accidentally believe they do 64-bit arithmetic while it could end up being 32-bit in some rare builds like could happen in the past. Overflows and mistakes can still happen if using the wrong type of course.</p>



<h2>Maximum string length</h2>



<p>To help us avoid mistakes on strings, in particular with integer overflows, but also with other logic, we have a general check of all string inputs to the library: they do not accept strings longer than a set limit. We deem that any string set that is longer is either just a blatant mistake or some kind of attempt (attack?) to trigger something weird inside the library. We return error on such calls. This maximum limit is right now eight megabytes, but we might adjust this in the future as the world and curl develop.</p>



<h2>keep master golden</h2>



<p>At no point in time is it allowed to break master. We only merge code into master that we believe is clean, fine and runs perfect. This still fails at time, but then we do our best at addressing the situation as quickly as possible.</p>



<h2>Always check for and act on errors</h2>



<p>In curl we always check for errors and we bail out <em>without leaking any memory</em> if (when!) they happen. This includes all memory operations, I/O, file operations and more. All calls.</p>



<p>Some developers are used to modern operating systems basically not being able to return error for some of those, but curl runs in many environments with varying behaviors. Also, a system library cannot <em>exit</em> or <em>abort</em> on errors, it needs to let the application take that decision.</p>



<h2>APIs and ABIs</h2>



<p>Every function and interface that is publicly accessible must <strong>never</strong> be changed in a way that risks breaking the API or ABI. For this reason and to make it easy to spot the functions that need this extra precautions, we have a strict rule: public functions are prefixed with ‚Äúcurl_‚Äù and no other functions use that prefix.</p>



<h2>Everyone can do it</h2>



<p>Thanks to the process of human reviewers, plenty of automatic tools and an elaborate and extensive test suite, everyone can (attempt to) write curl code. Assuming you know C of course. The risk that something bad would go in undetected, is roughly equal no matter who the author of the code is. The responsibility is shared.</p>



<p>Go ahead. You can do it!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At a time when the world is down to a single drug that can reliably cure gonorrhea, the U.S. government has shuttered the country‚Äôs premier sexually transmitted diseases laboratory, leaving experts aghast and fearful about what lies ahead.</p>



<p>The STD lab at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ‚Äî a leading player in global efforts to monitor for drug resistance in the bacteria that cause these diseases ‚Äî was among the targets of major staff slashing at the CDC this past week. All 28 full-time employees of the lab were fired.</p>



<p>STD clinicians and researchers were flummoxed, both because most of the other infectious diseases functions of the CDC were spared in this round of cuts, and because of the critical nature of the work the lab performed. Until the Trump administration announced the United States was withdrawing from the World Health Organization, the CDC lab was one of three international reference laboratories for STDs that worked with the WHO to conduct surveillance for infection rates and drug-resistance patterns and to recommend the best ways to treat these infections. The other two are in Australia and Sweden.</p>



<p>A CDC white paper on antibiotic resistance released during the first Trump administration listed drug-resistant gonorrhea as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/antimicrobial-resistance/media/pdfs/2019-ar-threats-report-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of five urgent threats</a> facing the country. Antimicrobial resistance to that last drug that reliably works to cure gonorrhea, ceftriaxone, is rare but on the rise globally.</p>



<p>‚ÄúThe loss of this lab is a huge deal to the American people,‚Äù said David C. Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, which represents state, city, and U.S. territorial STD prevention programs across the country. ‚ÄúWithout that lab, we would have not been able to appropriately diagnose and monitor drug-resistant gonorrhea.‚Äù</p>





<p>There has been no explanation from the Department of Health and Human Services, or its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., about why the STD lab was closed. When STAT asked the HHS press office about the closure, the response was swift ‚Äî but wholly unrelated to the question posed.</p>



<p>‚ÄúThe critical work of the CDC will continue under Secretary Kennedy‚Äôs vision to streamline HHS to better serve the American people. The reorganization will strengthen the CDC with the transfer of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), responsible for national disaster and public health emergency response, to the agency, reinforcing its core mission to protect Americans from health threats,‚Äù Emily Hilliard, deputy press secretary, said via email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A follow-up from STAT noting that the information provided was not about the STD lab drew no response.</p>



<p>Though STDs don‚Äôt garner as many headlines as Ebola, influenza, or Covid-19, they are among the most common diseases in the world ‚Äî not just infectious diseases, but diseases period, said Jeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine in infectious diseases, population, and public health at the USC Keck School of Medicine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Klausner was shocked by the CDC lab‚Äôs closure. ‚ÄúTo me, this is like a blind man with a chainsaw has just gone through the system and arbitrarily cut things without any rationale,‚Äù he said in an interview.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of the decision‚Äôs implications for efforts to monitor for drug-resistant STDs, Klausner put it bluntly: ‚ÄúWe are blind. As of [Tuesday], we are blind.‚Äù</p>



<p>Ina Park, a professor at the UCSF School of Medicine, and a co-author of the CDC‚Äôs 2024 laboratory guidelines for the diagnosis of syphilis, was also appalled.</p>



<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just horrific and it‚Äôs so foolish and shortsighted,‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúThis administration has sometimes brought people back when they‚Äôve realized that a service is vital and this is one of the times where I‚Äôm hoping that they will step up and do this.‚Äù</p>



<p>Klausner knows Kennedy personally, and reached out to tell him cutting the CDC‚Äôs STD lab was a mistake. As of Saturday, Klausner said he had not heard back from Kennedy on this issue.</p>



<p>The STD lab served multiple functions ‚Äî updating treatment guidelines, monitoring resistance patterns, and working to develop better tests for syphilis, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/30/syphilis-rates-epidemic-united-states/">a resurgent infection</a> for which existing tests are outdated.</p>



<p>It was a resource for clinicians who are having trouble curing patients of STIs that are not responding to treatment. Park noted she recently consulted on a case involving a woman who had been suffering for nine months from trichomoniasis, a vaginal infection. It was not responding to the treatments the woman‚Äôs physician prescribed. Park urged the treating doctor to send a sample to the CDC for additional testing, and the resulting treatment recommendation cured the infection.</p>





<p>The lab also leads the national surveillance for resistance patterns among STDs, generating genetic sequences of important isolates that it shares with the scientific community. That information is used in the development of tests and new therapeutics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the fired employees, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, noted the lab holds the world‚Äôs largest repository of gonorrhea isolates ‚Äî over 50,000, dating back to 1988 when the CDC began to collect them. Many of those isolates are in a freezer farm contracted by the CDC. What will happen to this invaluable scientific resource? It‚Äôs not clear.</p>



<p>‚ÄúThey‚Äôre irreplaceable. Even if you have new mutations now, you always need to track where they came from. The evolution, the pressures on what genes and all that. You need those older ones to really study that,‚Äù the individual said. ‚ÄúAre they just going to autoclave the whole thing and destroy it?‚Äù</p>



<p>The fired lab employee noted that the work that was being done at the CDC STD lab is not done elsewhere. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no duplication. There is no lab like us at NIH‚Äù ‚Äî the National Institutes of Health ‚Äî&nbsp;‚Äúor at any university. The university [researchers], they rely on our specimens to do work. But if no one collects them, it‚Äôs just a real blow.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>



<p>Julie Dombrowski, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington and director of the Seattle and King County public health department‚Äôs HIV, STD and hepatitis C program, stressed that no one should expect the private sector to step in to fill the gap the closure has created.</p>



<p>‚ÄúThere is no commercial interest and little money to be made in this arena,‚Äù Dombrowski said in an email.</p>



<p>‚ÄúIt means we will lose ground in the fight against syphilis, we will be blind to national-level trends in antibiotic resistance among gonorrhea, and we will lose world-class expertise that will be very difficult to rebuild,‚Äù she said.</p>



<p>The loss of the CDC lab comes at a particularly fraught time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the dawn of the antibiotic era, gonorrhea has systematically laid waste to every antibiotic used against it. The last reliably effective drug, ceftriaxone, is showing signs it too will soon be vanquished ‚Äî reports of pan-resistant and extremely drug resistant gonorrhea have emerged in other parts of the world. What‚Äôs happening elsewhere will happen here, said Edward Hook, a professor emeritus at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and an infectious diseases specialist who focuses on STIs.</p>





<p>‚ÄúWe live in a global village and these are global processes,‚Äù Hook said. ‚ÄúYou can go from one side of the world to another in less than a day, and as a result the antibiotic resistance and public health threats can spread very, very quickly.‚Äù</p>



<p>For the first time in years, two new drugs for gonorrhea are nearing the end of the developmental pipeline ‚Äî&nbsp;a major accomplishment. But given gonorrhea‚Äôs relentless development of resistance, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before it will develop the mutations needed to get around the new drugs too, said Barbara Van Der Pol, a professor of medicine and public health in the Heersink School of Medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Without the CDC lab, national efforts to monitor for resistance to the new drugs won‚Äôt exist, she said.</p>



<p>‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre going to have new drugs hit the market, but we‚Äôre not going to have a mechanism that has been vetted at the national level and is standardized that we can deploy quickly,‚Äù Van Der Pol said.</p>



<p>That lack of national standardization will create a situation where it‚Äôs hard to interpret what‚Äôs being seen, and when treatment guidelines ought to be changed, she said, likening the situation to the Wild West: ‚ÄúEverybody has a gun, but nobody knows when to use it.‚Äù</p>



<p>The loss of the lab also comes as clinicians are starting to adopt a new approach to trying to prevent sexually transmitted infections in people at high risk of acquiring them. As of last year, the CDC recommended that men who have sex with other men along with transgender women take a dose of the antibiotic doxycycline within 72 hours of having sex. The approach, known as doxy PEP ‚Äî for post-exposure prophylaxis ‚Äî&nbsp;has been shown to reduce syphilis and chlamydia infections by about 70% and gonorrhea infections by about 50%.</p>



<p>Although there is a lot of hope associated with this approach, there are also concerns it could drive antibiotic resistance. Implementing it in the absence of a laboratory tasked with monitoring drug resistance nationally strikes STD experts as imprudent.&nbsp; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve lost one of our key tools to be able to monitor that resistance,‚Äù Klausner said.&nbsp;‚ÄúThis is a terrible time to be cutting off the ability to conduct surveillance,‚Äù Park said.</p>

<p>Most improvements to cities are hard ‚Äî they take millions of dollars and years of planning.</p>
<p>But the change I have in mind is easy ‚Äî it just needs a few of us to decide to care.</p>
<p>Many people don‚Äôt realize that in order to build a new building, the plan has to be approved by the city‚Äôs design review board. This board is a group of people who have veto power over every aspect of the new building‚Äôs design.</p>
<p>For example, when a new bank branch was opened in downtown, our city design board approved a particular beige stucco for the outside wall. By accident, the contractors installed a faux wood instead. After the contractors appealed the mistake, city staff required them to tear the wall out and reinstall the approved siding.</p>
<p>The design board works hard to ensure that our city‚Äôs built environment is cohesive, beautiful, and in line with an established set of guidelines.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, someone can put up a 48-foot advertisement wherever they want with zero oversight. These ads are placed in very visible locations and designed to be bright, colorful, and distracting. Their appearance and placement do substantial harm to the peacefulness of the urban environment.</p>
<p>If someone showed up to the design review board wanting to splash a 48-foot advertisement in the face of every person coming into the city, they would get laughed out of the room. The reason these billboards get put up at all is because they‚Äôre exempt from design review, even though they‚Äôre a much more visible part of our city than the typical building.</p>
<p>Our neighbors will benefit much more from having a calmer public space than having a massive billboard reminding them to drink the latest beer.</p>
<p>The only people who won‚Äôt absolutely love this change are a few landowners who make money by spraying logos all over everyone‚Äôs public space. Literally everyone else benefits.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs ban billboards in the city.</p>

        <h2>So, what exactly is Moldable Development again?</h2>
        <p>Moldable Development is a way of programming through contextual tools built for each problem.</p>
        <p>The premise of Moldable Development is that there is no single perspective on a system that is correct. There are always many, and different parts of the system are best shown differently. These shapes summarize the system from specific perspectives. This then leads to a compressed communication and a new feedback loop.</p>
        <p>Glamorous Toolkit itself is an extensive case study of how contextual tools enhance programming abilities. It comes out of the box with thousands of extensions and examples that touch on the whole system.</p>
        <p>The goal? To make the inside of systems explainable. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
          <p><img src="https://gtoolkit.com/assets/pictures/gt-extensions.png"></p><p>The need for moldability is pervasive. The treemap shows the classes of Glamorous Toolkit organized in packages.

<p>We need to talk about the data. Crap data. We‚Äôre destroying our environment to create and store trillions of blurred images, half-baked videos, rip-off AI ‚Äòsongs‚Äô, rip-off AI animations, videos and images, emails with mega attachments, never-to-be-watched-again presentations, never-to-be-read-again reports, files and drawings from cancelled projects, drafts of drafts of drafts, out of date, inaccurate and plain wrong information, and gigabytes and gigabytes of poorly written, meandering content.</p>



<p>We‚Äôre destroying our environment to store copies of copies of copies of stuff we have no intention of ever looking at again. We‚Äôre destroying our environment to take 1.9 trillion photos every year. That‚Äôs more photos taken in one single year in the 2020s than were taken in the entire 20th century. That more than 200 photos taken for every child, woman and man alive. Every year. 12 trillion photos and growing, stored in the Cloud, the vast majority of which will never be viewed again. Mind boggling and exactly how Big Tech wants it.</p>



<p>I have spent almost 30 years working with hundreds of the largest organizations in the world in some 40 countries, trying to help them to better manage their content and data. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned. 90% plus of commercial or government data is crap, total absolute crap. Period. It should never have been created. It certainly should never have been stored. The rise of digital saw the explosion of data crap production. Content management systems were like giving staff diesel-fueled diggers, whereas before they only had data shovels. I remember around 2010 being in conversation with a Microsoft manager, who estimated that there were then about 14 million pages on Microsoft.com, and that four million of them had never been visited. Four million, I thought. That‚Äôs basically the population of the Republic of Ireland of pages that nobody has ever visited. Why were they created? All the time and effort and energy and waste that went into all these pages that nobody had ever read. We are destroying our environment to create and store crap. And nobody cares.</p>



<p>Everywhere I went it was nothing but the same old story. Data crap everywhere. Distributed publishing that allowed basically anyone to publish anything they wanted on the intranet. And nobody maintains anything. When Kyndryl, the world‚Äôs largest provider of IT infrastructure services, was spun off by its parent, IBM, they found they had data scattered over 100 disparate data warehouses. Multiple teams had multiple copies of the same data. After cleanup, they had deleted 90% of the data. There are 10 million stories like this.</p>



<p>Scottish Enterprise had 753 pages on its website, with 47 pages getting 80% of visits. A large organization I worked for had 100 million visits a year to its website, with 5% of pages getting 80% of visits. 100,000 of its pages had not been reviewed in 10 years. ‚ÄúA huge percentage of the data that gets processed is less than 24 hours old,‚Äù computer engineer, Jordan Tigani, explained. ‚ÄúBy the time data gets to be a week old, it is probably 20 times less likely to be queried than from the most recent day. After a month, data mostly just sits there.‚Äù The Southampton University public website found that 0.2% of pages got 90% of visits. Only 4% of its pages were ever visited. So, 96% of the roughly four million pages were not visited. One organization I knew of had 1,500 terabytes of data, with less than 2% ever having been accessed after it was first stored. There are 20 million more stories like these.</p>



<p>Most organizations have no clue what content they have. It‚Äôs worse. Most organizations don‚Äôt even know where all their data is stored. It‚Äôs even worse. Most organizations don‚Äôt even know how many computers they have. At least 50% of data in a particular organization is sitting on some server somewhere and nobody in management knows if it even exists; nor do they care. The average organization has hundreds of unsanctioned third-party app subscriptions being paid for by some manager‚Äôs credit card, storing everything from project chats to draft reports to product prototypes.</p>



<p>The Cloud made the crap data problem infinitely worse. The Cloud is what happens when the cost of storing data is less than the cost of figuring out what to do with the crap. One study found that data stored by UK engineering and construction industry firms had risen from an average of three terabytes in 2018 to 26 terabytes in 2023. That‚Äôs a compound annual growth rate of 50%! That sort of crap data explosion happened‚Äîand is happening‚Äîeverywhere. And nobody in management cares because it‚Äôs so ‚Äòcheap‚Äô to store data. And this is what AI is being trained on. And we wonder why AI gets stuff wrong so often? Crap data in. Crap data out. And nobody cares. Particularly at a senior management level, nobody cares. Senior management is full to overflowing with Big Tech groupies chanting about the latest tech miracle that‚Äôs going to magically transform and supercharge their careers. Having to deal with senior managers has always been the most unsavory part of my job, because when it comes to technology, these managers exist on a whole other level of stupid vanity and narcissistic pursuit of their own selfish agendas.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="postpath">

		 &gt; <a href="https://derflounder.wordpress.com/category/mac-administration/" rel="category tag">Mac administration</a>, <a href="https://derflounder.wordpress.com/category/macos/" rel="category tag">macOS</a>		 &gt; rsync replaced with openrsync on macOS&nbsp;Sequoia	</p></div><div id="post-12600">
			<p>On many Unix-based operating systems, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a> is a command line tool for transferring and synchronizing files on a computer, either between storage attached directly to the computer or between another computer located elsewhere on a network. The <strong>rsync</strong> command line tool has long been included on macOS, but Apple has provided the last version of <strong>rsync</strong> 2.x (<a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/NEWS#2.6.9">rsync 2.6.9, released in November 2006</a>) and did not update <strong>rsync</strong> past that even though <strong>rsync</strong> 3.x was released. Why not? It has to do with the version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GNU General Public License</a> (GPL) open source license that <strong>rsync</strong> 2.x and 3.x were released under, with <a href="https://rsync.samba.org/GPL2.html">rsync 2.x being released under the GPLv2 license</a> and <a href="https://rsync.samba.org/GPL.html">rsync 3.x being released under the GPLv3 license</a>. Without going in-depth into the background legal issues, the reason for not providing <strong>rsync</strong> 3.x is that Apple decided that while it could comply with the terms of GPLv2 license with regards to <strong>rsync</strong> 2.x, it could not comply with the terms of GPLv3 license with regards to <strong>rsync</strong> 3.x.</p>
<p>What this has meant for macOS is that it has been shipping with a version of <strong>rsync</strong> which was last updated in 2006. While Apple has been updating the <strong>rsync</strong> 2.6.9 command line tool it shipped with macOS as needed in response to security issues and other problems, the fact remains that Apple‚Äôs version of <strong>rsync</strong> up until macOS Sequoia was almost twenty years old and did not include any of the new features introduced in <strong>rsync</strong> versions which came after version 2.6.9.</p>
<p>Now with macOS Sequoia, Apple has replaced <strong>rsync</strong> 2.6.9 with <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openrsync">openrsync</a>, which is an implementation of <strong>rsync</strong> which is not using any version of the GPL open source license. Instead, <strong>opensync</strong> is licensed under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">BSD family of licenses</a>, specifically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license">ISC license</a>. The ISC license is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_license">permissive license</a>, which means it places minimal restrictions on on how the licensed software can be used, modified and distributed, which means Apple decided it is able to comply with the terms of the license for <strong>openrsync</strong> where it decided it could not comply with the terms of GPLv3 license with regards to <strong>rsync</strong> 3.x.</p>
<p>So I‚Äôve spent a bunch of time talking about licenses. Why does this change matter? It matters in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apple can ship updated versions of <strong>openrsync</strong> going forward without having to be concerned as to whether or not Apple can comply with the GPL open source license for <strong>rsync</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>openrsync</strong> command line tool is compatible with <strong>rsync</strong>, but as noted in the documentation <a href="https://github.com/kristapsdz/openrsync">openrsync accepts only a subset of rsync‚Äôs command line arguments</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Item number 2 is important for Mac admins because it may mean that <strong>rsync</strong> functionality that worked on older versions of macOS may not be working now on macOS Sequoia because that functionality is not available as part of the <strong>openrsync</strong> command line tool included with macOS Sequoia. For more information about what functionality is supported in the <strong>openrsync</strong> command line tool on macOS Sequoia, please see the link below:</p>
<p><a href="https://manp.gs/mac/1/openrsync">https://manp.gs/mac/1/openrsync</a></p>
<p>As of macOS 15.4, the <strong>openrsync</strong> tool is linked to <strong>/usr/bin/rsync</strong> so you can run the the <strong>openrsync</strong> command line tool like you have been the <strong>rsync</strong> command line tool. For version information about the <strong>openrsync</strong> command line tool, run the command shown below:</p>

Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/are-new-google-e2ee-emails-really-end-to-end-encrypted-kinda-but-not-really/">announced</a> that end-to-end encryption would be coming to Gmail.
What a sweet day!
Finally Google does something good.
Is it a new protocol to exchange public keys?
Maybe some way to fetch public key from destination server?
Oh sweet summer child.
</p>

<p>
The way Big G did it, is in the most annoying way.
The sender encrypts the message with her own key, an email with link is sent to receiver and if he wants to read it, he needs to open something they call "minimal gmail".
Yes, you've got that right.
To read an email sent from Gmail, one needs to use Gmail, even he never had any Google account.
</p>

<p>
I'm not going into how much this is not E2E, as this has already been proven.
But what I annoyed me the most is how Google assumes that only Gmail is worthy to read email from Gmail.
</p>

<p>
Until recently, there were basically three subcategories of email:
</p><ul>
<li>Normal email
</li><li>Gmail
</li><li>Outlook
</li></ul>

<p>
While the underlying exchange protocol is standardized,the later two have enough big market share to add custom behavior.
And no one cared, because if you're using G or O, you have no one else to blame but yourself (or your employer).
All we care about is being able to send email <em>to</em> the big two, which can be pain in the ass (I've heard).
</p>

<p>
But this power move is different.
If I receive an "e2e" encrypted email from gmail, I will not be able to read it without going to a Google service.
This means browser, javascript, tracking and all that crap.

</p>

<blockquote>
"IT teams also have the option to require all external recipients (even if they are Gmail users) to use the restricted version of Gmail. This helps ensure that their organization‚Äôs data does not end up stored on third-party servers and devices. It also makes it easier for organizations to protect their data by having the ability to apply security policies and revoke access to emails, no matter how long ago they were sent. Essentially, the E2EE email becomes like a document in Google Drive, allowing the IT team to control its access."<br>
-- <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/identity-and-security/gmail-easy-end-to-end-encryption-all-businesses">Google's documentation</a>
</blockquote>


<p>
This makes Google the actual owner of the sent message.
I can not read it (I will not open gmail!), I can not search for the email, I can not do anything.
My Email becomes just a notification channel I pay for.
"The recipient can then use a guest Google Workspace account to securely view and reply to the email" my ass.
</p>

<p>
Ergo: such emails go directly into spam list.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>In terms of unexplainable quirks</strong> I have as a human being, the weirdest one is this: Gum freaks me out. I hate the idea of it, to the point where I dislike the word.</p><p>It really bothers me, like nails on a chalkboard. I‚Äôve never understood why. And it‚Äôs to the point where I‚Äôve kind of checked out of things I might like just because their name references the word. (Apologies to <em>Stereogum</em>, I‚Äôm sure your music publication is just great, the problem is your name.)</p><p>So I‚Äôve never been a <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> user outside of a couple of random purchases here and there. I just couldn‚Äôt get past the name. But nonetheless, I respected the role it played in creating what we call the creator economy.</p><p>And I‚Äôm also an advocate for the creator economy becoming less platform-driven. Someone recently made the point to me that the recent rise in low-code and AI-based tooling is likely going to separate out the platforms that solve tough problems‚Äîthe Stripes of the world‚Äîfrom those that simply put a nice interface on a problem. And having access to tools that you operate yourself is a way to get there.</p><p>Which is why, when I saw that the company had announced it was open-sourcing its application the other day, I got past my weird linguistic quirk and saw something that could be a big deal. I think we need more creator economy things in the self-hostable category, and putting Gumroad in that category feels like it could be a huge kick in the arm for that space.</p><p>So I did what I always do: I posted about it. It saw a little bit of pickup, particularly on Mastodon. I noted a quirk of the company‚Äôs open-source license that doesn‚Äôt truly make it open-source according to commonly accepted definitions, but I otherwise just passively shared it.</p><p>But with a little retrospect and a little more digging, I‚Äôm feeling less excited about it. In fact, I‚Äôm slightly frustrated with myself that I shared it so passively. There are some real problems with Gumroad that make it a terrible foundation for a creator economy that puts the creator in control. And there‚Äôs also a big issue with its leadership that almost went unnoticed on the very same day that the news was announced.</p><p>So, now, rather than just sharing it, I‚Äôm writing about it.</p></div><div><figure><img src="https://proxy.tedium.co/CRFbdZkmkG855zMN1H6oTyq36KI=/1281x972/filters:quality(80)/uploads/Screenshot-From-2025-04-06-13-32-54.png" width="1281" height="972" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot From 2025 04 06 13 32 54"><figcaption>Gumroad goes open source! But wait, about that ‚Ä¶</figcaption></figure><h3>Why people are frustrated with Gumroad</h3><p>First, some existing users have pointed out some issues with the Gumroad service that have made it significantly less useful for the average user. Fellow traveler Evan Hildreth <a href="https://oddevan.com/2025/04/04/bumps-in-the-gumroad.html">pointed out two specific issues</a>: First, the platform changed its rules for when you could email end users, which was annoying but understandable, and more troublingly, the company seems to have replaced its customer support with LLMs almost entirely. As he wrote:</p><blockquote><p>Finally, I asked how to contact Gumroad support. It pointed me to the help site&nbsp;<em>that didn‚Äôt exist</em>&nbsp;and the contact form within. I eventually found an email on another page and sent a message there; the response was very obviously from the same chatbot.</p><p>Chatbots are fine as&nbsp;<em>one of many</em>&nbsp;options to access support information. But as the&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;option? When it‚Äôs been trained on a help site that references itself (and therefore references a site that doesn‚Äôt exist)?</p></blockquote><p>Additionally, the open-source licensing thing is kind of a fib‚Äî<a href="https://danb.me/blog/gumroad-is-not-open-source/">it‚Äôs more of a source-available license</a> that limits your ability to use the tool after you hit a certain threshold. It‚Äôs not unheard of for this kind of license to be used by companies looking to lean into self-hosting without losing their money train. I have suggested that it can provide a middle ground for folks getting started as long as they‚Äôre aware of its limitations.</p><p>FOSS die-hards may not agree, but this kind of threading-the-needle can be done well, and honestly, IMHO. A good example is the content-management framework <a href="https://directus.io/">Directus</a>, <a href="https://directus.io/bsl">which essentially makes it free to use</a> in most cases, unless you make more than $5 million in finances per year, at which point you need to start paying for it. Not purely open source, but it throws FOSS folks a bone by making it so that versions of the software that are more than three years old revert to the General Public License.</p><p>How does Gumroad do it? <a href="https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad/blob/main/LICENSE.md">Well</a> ‚Ä¶</p><blockquote><p>You may use the software under this license only if (1) your company has less than 1 million USD (2024) total revenue in the prior tax year, and less than 10 million USD (2024) GMV (Gross Merchandise Value), or (2) you are a non-profit organization or government entity. Adjust the revenue threshold for inflation according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics‚Äô consumer price index for all urban consumers, U.S. city average, for all items, not seasonally adjusted, 1982‚Äì1984=100 reference base. If you are a company and exceed either of the limits in (1), your license ends. You may contact the licensor to discuss an alternative license.</p></blockquote><p>So essentially, if you ever have a single good year, you‚Äôre stuck paying a custom license fee.</p><figure><img src="https://proxy.tedium.co/rHxSqatPcGK0hwrilTSx9e83T6U=/799x533/filters:quality(80)/uploads/4871933275_3a45618da0_c.jpg" width="799" height="533" loading="lazy" alt="4871933275 3a45618da0 c"><figcaption>I know, the image looks confusing and out of place in this story, but I promise you it is related. (<a href="https://flickr.com/photos/eschipul/4871933275/">eschipul/Flickr</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3>Announcing an open-source shift as a big story drops</h3><p>But if that‚Äôs all Gumroad was doing, I wouldn‚Äôt feel compelled to say anything. The reason I‚Äôm speaking up <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-department-of-veterans-affairs-ai/">is because of this <em>Wired</em> story,</a> released on the very same day Gumroad announced its ‚Äúopen source‚Äù license, which may have had the effect of minimizing the story‚Äôs viral impact. So I guess maybe a guy with a blog and a distaste for Gumroad‚Äôs name can give it a second stab.</p><p>The story is about DOGE, but it points out something curious:</p><blockquote><p>On March 25, tech staffers and contractors at the VA noticed an unfamiliar name trying to push changes that could impact VA.gov code. It was Sahil Lavingia, a newcomer to the agency listed in the VA‚Äôs internal directory as an adviser to the chief of staff, Christopher Syrek.</p></blockquote><p>Who‚Äôs Sahil Lavingia, you might ask? Why, the founder and CEO of Gumroad! It‚Äôs not even the central point of the piece, but the fact is, if you‚Äôre supporting Gumroad‚Äîa tool that, notably, has survived as long as it did because of <a href="https://republic.com/gumroad-march-2021">a high-profile crowdfunding campaign</a>‚Äîyou‚Äôre allowing its CEO the financial freedom to work in the Department of Veterans Affairs, at the behest of DOGE, for free.</p><p>When submitted a list of questions about his work for DOGE, Lavingia told <em>Wired</em>: ‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôm not going to answer these, besides to say I‚Äôm unpaid. And a fan of your work!‚Äù</p><p>And the reason he has all this free time? Simple: As the piece notes, he achieved financial stability with Gumroad by replacing nearly all of its employees with automation. (Hence why Evan Hildreth can‚Äôt get any damn support.) Which is now what he wants to do with the VA, as the piece explains.</p><p>There‚Äôs a lot more there‚Äîwhich I recommend checking out the full piece to get a grasp on, but suffice it to say: If you disagree with this, now may be a good time to stop using Gumroad. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre going to find a support person there anyway.</p><figure><img src="https://proxy.tedium.co/0vIQut_MdPMJhq9aLiSEWzIH8-I=/1000x750/filters:quality(80)/uploads/GumballMachine.jpg" width="1000" height="750" loading="lazy" alt="Gumball Machine"><figcaption>No reason you have to use someone else‚Äôs gumball machine. (<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/woman-in-green-jacket-standing-beside-stainless-steel-round-container-4nsrOXYL-90">Pete Alexopoulos/Unsplash</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3>Maybe it‚Äôs time to shake up the creator economy calculus?</h3><p>May I make a suggestion? If the tech firm you‚Äôre relying on to make money is using AI and low-code tools to offer their service to you anyway, what‚Äôs stopping you from just doing the same thing? You can make a Gumroad or a Patreon. It‚Äôs easier than ever‚Äî<a href="https://tedium.co/2025/03/20/snap-fasteners-tariffs-history/">I just featured a guy in the newsletter who did just that</a>.</p><p>To me, I think that there is a real opportunity to take away the reins from middlemen who extract value rather than add it by leaning into things we host ourselves. Creators, for too long, have given too much power away to the company that made our lives mildly more convenient. If they‚Äôre trying to optimize to the nubs, destroying quality of service in the process, why even bother letting them have a lane in the middle?</p><p>To be clear, not everyone‚Äôs a bad player‚Äîand I will stand up for services I think do it well. (I like Ko-Fi, and personally <a href="https://ko-fi.com/tedium/commissions?commissionAlias=caf0972c99&amp;openCommissionsMenu=True#buyShopCommissionModal">just launched something there</a> last week.) But if users get lost in the shuffle on a given platform, what‚Äôs the point of sticking with them?</p><p>AI is not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, so if you don‚Äôt use it, don‚Äôt use it. Nobody‚Äôs asking you to be a vibe coder over here. But I think there‚Äôs a real opportunity to work around the current system‚Äôs deficiencies for creators, if they want to go down that road. If the makers of these platforms are optimizing everything to within an inch of its life, why couldn‚Äôt creators do that?</p><p>Plus, you could give it a name that doesn‚Äôt have the word ‚Äúgum‚Äù in it. Which I personally would appreciate.</p></div></div>]]></description>
