<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This post is making a point - generative AI is relatively cheap -
that might seem so obvious it doesn't need making. I'm mostly writing it because I've
repeatedly had the same discussion in the past six months where people claim the opposite.
Not only is the misconception still around, but it's not even getting less frequent. This
is mainly written to have a document I can point people at, the next time it repeats.</p>

<p>It seems to be a common, if not a majority, belief that Large
Language Models (in the colloquial sense of "things that are like
ChatGPT") are very expensive to operate. This then leads to a ton
of innumerate analyses about how AI companies must be obviously
doomed, as well as a myopic view on how consumer AI businesses can/will
be monetized.</p>
<p>It's an understandable mistake, since inference was indeed very
expensive at the start of the AI boom, and those costs were talked about
a lot. But inference has gotten cheaper even faster
than models have gotten better, and nobody has an intuition for
something becoming 1000x cheaper in two years. It just doesn't happen.
It doesn't help that the common pricing model ("$ per million tokens")
is very hard to visualize.</p>
<p>So let's compare LLMs to web search. I'm choosing search as the
comparison since it's in the same vicinity and since it's
something everyone uses and nobody pays for, not because I'm suggesting that
ungrounded generative AI is a good substitute for search.</p>

<read-more></read-more>

<p>(It should also go without saying that these are just my personal
opinions.)</p>
<h3 id="what-does-a-web-search-cost">What is the price of a web search?</h3>
<p>Here's the public API pricing for some companies operating their own
web search infrastructure, retrieved on 2025-05-02:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing">Gemini API pricing</a>
lists a "Grounding with Google Search" feature at $35/1k queries. I
believe that's the best number we can get for Google, they don't publish
prices for a "raw" search result API.<br>
</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/pricing">Bing Search API</a>
is priced at $15/1k queries at the cheapest tier.<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://brave.com/search/api/">Brave</a>
has a price of $5/1k searches at the cheapest tier. Though there's something very
strange about their pricing structure, with the unit pricing increasing as
the quota increases, which is the opposite of what you'd expect. The
tier with real quota is priced at $9/1k searches.</li>
</ul>
<p>So there's a range of prices, but not a horribly wide one, and with the
engines you'd expect to be of higher quality also having higher prices.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-equivalent-llm-usage-cost">What is the price of LLMs in a similar domain?</h3>
<p>To make a reasonable comparison between those search prices and LLM
prices, we need two numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many tokens are output per query?<br>
</li>
<li>What's the price per token?</li>
</ul>
<p>I picked a few arbitrary queries from my search history, and phrased
them as questions, and ran them on Gemini 2.5 Flash (thinking mode off)
in AI Studio:</p>
<ul>
<li>[When was the term LLM first used?] -&gt; 361 tokens, 2.5
seconds<br>
</li>
<li>[What are the top javascript game engines?] -&gt; 1145 tokens, 7.6
seconds<br>
</li>
<li>[What are the typical carry-on bag size limits in europe?] -&gt; 506
tokens, 3.4 seconds<br>
</li>
<li>[List the 10 largest power outages in history] -&gt; 583 tokens, 3.7
seconds</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that I'm not judging the quality of the answers here. The
purpose is just to get rough numbers for how large typical responses
are. A 500-1000 token range seems like a reasonable estimate.</p>
<p>What's the price of a token? The pricing is sometimes different for input
and output tokens. Input tokens tend to be cheaper, and our inputs are
very short compared to the outputs, so for simplicity let's consider all
the tokens to be outputs. Here's the pricing of some relevant models,
retrieved on 2025-05-02:</p>

<p>If we assume the average query uses 1k tokens, these prices would be
directly comparable to the prices per 1k search queries. That's convenient.</p>
<p>The low end of that spectrum is at least an order of magnitude
cheaper than even the cheapest search API, and even the models at the
low end are pretty capable. The high end is about on par with the
highest end of search pricing. To compare a midrange pair on quality,
the Bing Search vs. a Gemini 2.5 Flash comparison shows the LLM being
1/25th the price.</p>
<p>Note that many of the above models have cheaper pricing in exchange
for more flexible scheduling (Anthropic, Google and OpenAI give a 50%
discount for batch requests, Deepseek is 50%-75% cheaper during off-peak
hours). I've not included those cheaper options in the table to keep
things comparable, but the presence of those cheaper tiers is worth
keeping in mind when thinking about the next section...</p>
<h3 id="objection">Objection!</h3>
<p>I know some people are going to have objections to this
back-of-the-envelope calculation, and a lot of them will be totally
legit concerns. I'll try to address some of them preemptively. Slightly
different assumptions can easily lead to clawing back 10% here and 50%
there. But I don't see how to bridge a 25x gap just for breaking even,
let alone making the AI significantly more expensive. If you want to play
around with different assumptions, there's a little calculator widget
below.</p>
<p><strong>Surely the typical LLM response is longer than that</strong>
- I already picked the upper end of what the (very light) testing
suggested as a reasonable range for the type of question that I'd use
web search for. There's a lot of use cases where the inputs and outputs
are going to be much longer (e.g. coding), but then you'd need to also
switch the comparison to something in that same domain as well.</p>
<p><strong>The LLM API prices must be subsidized to grab market
share -- i.e. the prices might be low, but the costs are high</strong> -
I don't think they are, for a few reasons. I'd instead assume
APIs are typically profitable on a unit basis. I have not found any
credible analysis suggesting otherwise.</p>
<p>First, there's not that much motive to gain API market share
with unsustainably cheap prices. Any gains would be temporary, since
there's no long-term lock-in, and better models are released weekly.
Data from paid API queries will also typically not be used for training
or tuning the models, so getting access to more data wouldn't explain
it. Note that it's not just that you'd be losing money on each of
these queries for no benefit, you're losing the compute that could
be spent on training, research, or more useful types of inference.</p>
<p>Second, some of those models have been released with open weights and
API access is also available from third-party providers who would have
no motive to subsidize inference. (Or the number in the table isn't even
first party hosting -- I sure can't figure out what the Vertex AI
pricing for Gemma 3 is). The pricing of those third-party hosted APIs
appears competitive with first-party hosted APIs. For example, the
<a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/deepseek-r1/providers">Artificial Analysis
summary on Deepseek R1 hosting</a>.</p>
<p>Third, Deepseek released <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/open-infra-index/blob/main/202502OpenSourceWeek/day_6_one_more_thing_deepseekV3R1_inference_system_overview.md">actual
numbers</a> on their inference efficiency in February. Those numbers
suggest that their normal R1 API pricing has about 80% margins
when considering the GPU costs, though not any other serving costs.</p>
<p>Fourth, there are a bunch of first-principles analyses on the cost structure
of models with various architectures should be. Those are of course mathematical
models, but those costs line up pretty well with the observed end-user
pricing of models whose architecture is known. See the references section for
links.</p>
<p><strong>The search API prices amortize building and updating the
search index, LLM inference is based on just the cost of
inference</strong> - This seems pretty likely to be true, actually? But
the effect can't really be <em>that</em> large for a popular model:
e.g. the allegedly leaked OpenAI financials claimed $4B/year spent on
inference vs. $3B/year on training. Given the crazy growth of
inference volumes (e.g. Google recently claimed a <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/io-2025-keynote/">
50x increase in token volumes in the last year</a>) the training costs
are getting amortized much more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>The search API prices must have higher margins than LLM
inference</strong> - It's possible. I certainly don't know what the
margins of any Search API providers are, though it seems fair to assume
they're pretty robust. But, well, see the point above about Deepseek's
releasd numbers on the R1 profit margins.</p>
<p>Also, it seems quite plausible that some Search providers would
accept lower margins, since at least Microsoft execs have testified
under oath that they'd be willing to pay more for the iOS query stream
than their revenue, just to get more usage data.</p>
<p><strong>Web search returns results 20x-100x faster than an LLM
finishes the query, how could it be more expensive?</strong> - Search
latency can be improved by parallelizing the problem, while LLM
inference is (for now) serial in nature. The task of predicting a single token can
be parallelized, but the you can't predict all the output tokens at
once.</p>

<p><strong>But OpenAI made a loss, and they don't expect to make profit for years!</strong> -
That's because a huge proportion of their usage is not monetized at all,
despite the usage pattern being ideal for it. OpenAI reportedly made a
loss of $5B in 2024. They also reportedly have 500M MAUs. To reach break-even,
they'd just need to monetize (e.g. with ads) those free users for an average of $10/year,
or $1/month. A $1 ARPU for a service like this would be pitifully low.
</p>

<p>If the reported numbers are true, OpenAI doesn't actually have
high costs for a consumer service that popular, which is what you'd
expect to see if the high cost of inference was the problem. They just
have a very low per-user revenue, by choice.</p>

<h3 id="widget">Sensitivity analysis</h3>

<p>

  a calculator:

<h3 id="why-does-this-matter">Why does this matter?</h3>
<p>I mean, you're right to ask that. Nothing really matters and
eventually we'll all be dead.</p>
<p>But it is interesting how many people have built their mental
model for the near future on a premise that was true for only a brief
moment. Some things that will come as a surprise to them even assuming
all progress stops right now:</p>
<p>There's an argument advanced by some people about how low
prices mean it'll be impossible for AI companies to ever recoup
model training costs. The thinking seems to be that it's just
the prices that have been going down, but not the costs, and
the low prices must be an unprofitable race to the bottom for
what little demand there is. What's happening and will continue
to happen instead is that as costs go down, the prices go down too,
and demand increases as new uses become viable. For an example,
look at the <a href="https://openrouter.ai/rankings">OpenRouter
API traffic volumes</a>, both in aggregate and in the relative
share of cheaper models.
</p>
<p>This post was mainly about APIs, but consumer usage will have
exactly the same cost structure, just a different monetization
structure. And given how low the unit costs must be, advertising isn't merely
viable but lucrative.</p>
<p>From this it follows that the financials of frontier AI labs are a
lot better than some innumerate pundits would have you believe. They're
making a loss because they're not under pressure to be profitable, and
aren't actively trying to monetize consumer traffic yet. This
could well be a land grab unlike APIs, since unpaid consumer queries
may be used for training while paid API queries typically are not.
Even the subscription pricing might be there
mainly for demand management rather than trying to run a profit.</p>
<p>The real cost problem isn't going to be with the LLMs themselves,
it's with all the backend services that AI agents will want to access
if even a rudimentary form of the agentic vision actually materializes.
Running the AI is already cheap, will keep getting cheaper, and will always
have a monetization model of some sort since it's what the end user is
interacting with. Neither of those is true for the end-user services
that have been turned into AI backends without their consent. An AI
trying to, I don't know, book concert tickets whenever a band I like
plays in my town will probably be phenomenally expensive to its
third-party backends (e.g. scraping ticket sites). Those sites will be
uncompensated for the expense while also removing their actual revenue
streams.</p>
<p>I don't really know how that plays out.</p>
<p>Obviously many service owners will try to make unauthorized scraping
harder, but that's a very hard problem to solve on the web. Maybe some
of them give up on the web entirely, and move to mobile where they can
at least get device attestations. Some might just give up on the open
web, and require all usage to be signed in, with account creation being
gated on something scarce. Some might become unviable and close up shop
entirely.</p>
<p>If/when that happens, what's the play on the AI agent side? Will they
choose an escalating adversarial arms race with increasingly dodgy
tactics, or will they eventually decide that it's better to pay for the
services they use? The former seems unsustainable. If the latter, then
it feels like the core engineering challenge becomes one of building data
provider backends optimized specifically for AI use, with the goal of scaling to
massive volumes and cheaper unit prices, with the trade-off being higher latency, lower
reliability and lower quality.
That could be quite interesting from a systems perspective. (Yes, I'm aware
of <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol">MCP</a>,
but it's a solution to an orthogonal issue.)
</p>
<p>But one thing I'm confident won't be happening is that it's the AIs that
turn out to be too expensive to run.</p>

		<p>In this day and age, celebrities have a lot of influence over our politics. Garthwaite and Moore <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/%7Egelman/stuff_for_blog/celebrityendorsements_garthwaitemoore.pdf">estimated</a> that Oprah Winfrey’s endorsement of Barack Obama in 2008 netted him an extra 1 million votes [1]. More recently, an Instagram post by Taylor Swift <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/12/taylor-swift-democrats-midterm-election-celebrity-political-endorsements">led over 160,000 Americans to register to vote</a> prior to the 2018 midterm elections [2]. With the advent of social media, we have an ever increasing need to know celebrities’ opinions on the political issue of the day. Celebrities by and large have obliged — but with notable exceptions.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Mendes">Shawn Mendes</a> is a pop singer/songwriter from Canada who became famous several years ago. If you’re anything like me, you wake up every morning, thinking to yourself, “What is Shawn Mendes’ position on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuril_Islands_dispute">Kuril Islands territorial dispute</a> between Japan and Russia?” You try Googling the “Shawn Mendes Kuril Islands” — but alas, just like on every previous morning, you fail to find a public statement from Mendes on the issue. Indeed, as far as I can tell, Mendes has never publicly stated his position on the dispute.</p>

<p>Well, lucky you: I believe I may have found out Mendes’ opinion, cryptically hidden in his 2018 single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYDVwGnAKFM">“Lost in Japan”</a> [3].</p>
<p>The chorus of “Lost in Japan” goes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you got plans tonight?<br>
I’m a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I<br>
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight<br>
‘Cause I-I-I can’t get you off my mind<br>
Can’t get you off my mind<br>
Can’t get you off my mind (oh)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the song’s name, Mendes is clearly <em>not</em> lost in Japan: he is a “couple hundred miles” from Japan. This raises the question: if not in Japan, where exactly is Shawn Mendes lost? Let’s find out.</p>

<p>Consider Figure 2: circles of radius 200 miles centered at various points in Japan. Not much land is a couple hundred miles from Japan, but there is some. Perhaps Mendes is in South Korea, perhaps the Russian far-east. South Korea seems much more plausible, since it’s substantially more populous than these parts of Russia; but we can’t be sure yet. Let’s take a closer look at the lyrics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All it’d take is <strong>one flight</strong><br>
<strong>We’d be in the same time zone</strong><br>
[…]</p>
<p>Do you got plans tonight?<br>
<strong>I’m a couple hundred miles from Japan</strong>, and I<br>
I was thinking I could <strong>fly to your hotel tonight</strong><br>
‘Cause I-I-I can’t get you off my mind<br>
[…]</p>
<p>I know it’s more than just a friendship<br>
I can hear you thinking ’bout it, yeah<br>
<strong>Do I gotta convince you?</strong><br>
<strong>That you shouldn’t fall asleep?</strong><br>
<strong>It’ll only be a couple hours</strong><br>
<strong>And I’m about to leave</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mendes is a couple hundred miles from Japan and wants to fly there tonight to see his “more than just a friend” (henceforth, “friend” for short). There are several useful pieces of information in the lyrics, the first of which is “We’d be in the same time zone.” This implies that Mendes is currently <em>not</em> in the same time zone as his friend. Let us look now at a map of time zones in eastern Asia.</p>

<p>Aha! As demonstrated by Figure 3, Mendes cannot be in South Korea, because South Korea and Japan are in the same time zone.</p>
<p>Instead, perhaps Mendes is in China, and that “couple hundred miles” is an innocent understatement. However, China is too far from Japan for this to be a real possibility. Indeed, about the shortest flight that one could take between China and Japan is from Shanghai to Fukuoka.</p>

<p>There is another possibility to consider: the Ryukyu Islands, an archipelago of islands belonging to Japan, stretch very far south, almost to Taiwan:</p>

<p>The lyrics say, “All it’d take is one flight.” Is there really a direct flight from Taipei to this tiny island?

<p>It is therefore unlikely that Mendes would find himself in Taipei to begin with. This leaves us with only one possibility: Mendes is flying in from the barren lands of the Russian far-east. Let’s take a closer look.</p>

<p>The land masses belonging to Russia that are within 200 miles of Japan include: part of the Sakhalin Island; small parts of the east coast of the Russian mainland; and the Kuril islands to the northeast<sup><a id="ref1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. It turns out that between all of these places, there is only one airport with direct flights to Japan: the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Airport, based in the town of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, the largest on Sakhalin Island (population 180,000).</p>

Perhaps Mendes is flying from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk to Sapporo, the largest city in northern Japan. There is one flight from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk to Sapporo: <a href="https://www.flightsfrom.com/UUS-CTS?sdate=2019-11-17">Aurora flight HZ4536</a>. On most days of the week, the flight is not an evening flight — but on Sunday it is, departing Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk at 6:30pm. So maybe Mendes plans to take the Sunday night flight from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk to Sapporo. This sounds reasonable, but there are a couple issues with this theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>The flight, which departs at 6:30pm, arrives at… 6:00pm, due to a time zone difference.<sup><a id="ref2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> In the song lyrics, Mendes asks his friend, “Do I gotta convince you? / That you shouldn’t fall asleep?” But 6pm is hardly late enough that his friend might be thinking about going to sleep.</li>
<li>Mendes goes on to say, “It’ll only be a couple hours / And I’m about to leave.” The flight alone takes 90 minutes. Mendes would presumably need to take a taxi to the airport, pass through security and customs, and upon arriving in Sapporo, take a taxi to wherever his friend is staying — all in all, probably at least four hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>(One very reasonable objection is that the flight schedule could very well have changed since Mendes wrote the song. However, as far as I can tell, this is not the case: I checked the Web Archive for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.new-chitose-airport.jp/en/airport/fis/result/">archives of the Sapporo Airport’s arrivals page</a>, and going back as far as 2016 it appears that all flights from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk arrived in the afternoon or early evening.)</p>
<p>It seems that we’ve overlooked something. And indeed, I believe we have: there are two airports to the east-northeast of Sapporo, labeled with red dots in Figure 11. These flights are to Iturup Island (the more northeasterly one) and Kunashir Island, both of which belong to the Kuril Islands chain.</p>
<p>It is helpful at this point to go over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuril_Islands_dispute">some history</a>. The Kuril Islands have been a point of contention between Japan and Russia for quite some time. In the 1855 Treaty of Shimoda, the two countries agreed that the four southernmost islands — including the aforementioned Iturup and Kunashir Islands — would belong to Japan, while the more northerly islands would belong to Russia.</p>
<p>However, after World War II, Russia occupied these four islands, much as the allies occupied Germany after World War II. Ever since then, Japan has seen this occupation as a violation of its sovereignty, and although the islands are now unambiguously under Russian administration, Japan maintains its claim [10].</p>

<p>It is plausible, however, that Shawn Mendes thinks of the four southernmost Kuril Islands as rightfully belonging to Japan. So when Mendes says he’s flying to Japan tonight, perhaps he is talking about these islands.</p>
<p>Indeed: on Sundays, Aurora Flight HZ4617 departs from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk at 7:50pm and lands on Iturup Island (the more northerly of the two red dots in Exhibit 11) at 8:55pm.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mendes would arrive at Iturup Airport at 8:50pm and probably wouldn’t make it to his friend’s hotel until well past 9pm. The lyrics “Do I gotta convince you? / That you shouldn’t fall asleep” make much more sense with this flight in mind.</li>
<li>In addition to the flight time being 20 minutes shorter, this is a domestic flight (since the Kuril Islands are administered by Russia), so Mendes wouldn’t need to go through customs. This means that, while Mendes is optimistic in saying that “It’ll only be a couple hours,” it’s a much less egregious underestimate on his part.</li>
</ul>
<p>(There is also a 7-8:30pm flight from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk to Kunashir Island on Thursdays. This flight also fits the constraints of the song lyrics, albeit somewhat less closely.)</p>
<p>Now, you might be skeptical of a step or two in the above reasoning. Perhaps flight schedules have changed. Perhaps I overlooked something. However, I believe that I have found incontrovertible<sup><a id="ref3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> photographic evidence that Shawn Mendes did in fact visit Iturup Island:</p>

<p>***</p>
<p>The case is closed: beyond a reasonable doubt, we may conclude that Shawn Mendes was in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, looking to fly to Iturup Island to see his friend. Crucially, then, when Mendes sings, “I’m a couple hundred miles from <em>Japan</em> tonight,” he is referring to Iturup Island as “Japan,” thus taking a clear stand on the territorial dispute over the Kuril Islands.</p>
<p>Prior to pursuing this line of inquiry, the Kuril Islands dispute was one of few political issues on which I had no opinion. However, learning of Shawn Mendes’ bold stance — his subtle, cryptic, yet cutting reference to these islands as “Japan” — has clarified my thoughts on the issue. I am now firmly on Japan’s side in this dispute and believe it imperative that we stand up to Russia and its immoral 1945 land grab.</p>
<p>Do you got plans tonight? Because if not — and if you happen to be reading this in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk on an evening — then you’re a couple hundred miles from Japan tonight.</p>

<p>In a new modeling study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02343-9" rel="noopener" target="_blank">published</a> in Communications Earth &amp; Environment, researchers at the University of California, Riverside, showed that restoring forests to their preindustrial extent could lower global average temperatures by 0.34 degrees Celsius. That is roughly one-quarter of the warming the Earth has already experienced.</p>
<p>The study is based on an increase in tree area of about 12 million square kilometers, which is 135% of the area of the United States, and similar to estimates of the global tree restoration potential of 1 trillion trees. It is believed the planet has lost nearly half of its trees (about 3 trillion) since the onset of industrialized society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Reforestation is not a silver bullet,” said Bob Allen, a climate scientist at UC Riverside and the paper’s lead author. “It’s a powerful strategy, but it has to be paired with serious emissions reductions.”</p>
<p>While previous studies have largely focused on trees’ ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere, this research includes another critical dimension. Trees also have an effect on the chemical makeup of the atmosphere in ways that amplify their cooling effect.</p>
<p>Trees naturally release compounds known as biogenic volatile organic compounds, or BVOCs. These interact with other gases to form particles that reflect sunlight and encourage cloud formation, both of which help cool the atmosphere. Most climate models do not account for these chemical interactions.</p>
<p>“When you include these chemical effects, the net cooling impact becomes more significant,” Allen said. “It’s a crucial part of the picture.”</p>
<p>The benefits of reforestation, however, are not evenly distributed. The study found that tropical forests produce stronger cooling effects with fewer drawbacks. Trees in these regions are more efficient at absorbing carbon and produce greater amounts of BVOCs. They also have less of the surface darkening effect that can cause warming by trees in higher latitudes.</p>
<p>Beyond global temperature, reforestation can also affect regional air quality. The researchers found a 2.5 percent reduction in atmospheric dust in the northern hemisphere under their restoration scenario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the tropics, increased BVOC emissions were a mixed bag in terms of air quality. They were linked to worse air based on particulate matter associated with enhanced aerosol formation, but improved air quality based on ozone measurements.</p>
<p>These localized effects, the researchers say, suggest that reforestation efforts do not need to be massive to be meaningful.</p>
<p>“Smaller efforts can still have a real impact on regional climates,” said Antony Thomas, graduate student in UCR’s Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and co-author of the study. “Restoration doesn’t have to happen everywhere at once to make a difference.”</p>
<p>The researchers acknowledge that the scenario modeled in the study is unlikely to be realized. It assumes trees could be restored to all areas where they once grew, which would require reclaiming developments such as housing as well as farmland and pastures. That raises questions about food security and land-use priorities.</p>
<p>“There are 8 billion people to feed,” Allen said. “We have to make careful decisions about where trees are planted. The best opportunities are in the tropics, but these are also the areas where deforestation continues today.”</p>
<p>The researchers highlight Rwanda as an example of how conservation and economic development can align. There, tourism revenue tied to forest protection is reinvested in local communities, providing incentives to preserve land that might otherwise be cleared.</p>
<p>The study began as a project in Allen’s graduate-level climate modeling course at UC Riverside. It eventually evolved into a collaborative research paper, drawing on Earth system modeling and land-use data to explore what large-scale reforestation could realistically achieve.</p>
<p>Its conclusion is cautiously optimistic: forest restoration is a meaningful part of the climate solution, but not a substitute for cutting fossil fuel use.</p>
<p>“Climate change is real,” Thomas said. “And every step toward restoration, no matter the scale, helps.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.freespeechextremist.com/blog/fse-vs-fbi.html">https://blog.freespeechextremist.com/blog/fse-vs-fbi.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44220860">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="md-content"><h2>FSE Meets the FBI!</h2><p>I have for you a bizarre tale of scrapers, feds, data poisoning, Torswats, and everyone's favorite fedi instance.  It veers technical, because I suspect it will be of interest to other people running servers with UGC (i.e., every fedi instance), and also because the mechanics of how I figured out what I figured out might be useful.  It's also got information about how the FBI collects data, which is of interest to everyone, but especially US citizens.  I have a few pieces of the puzzle, maybe someone with interlocking pieces can say more; I'm happy to compare notes.
</p>
<p>To summarize, the FBI pays some shady companies to scrape data, the data is scanned for keywords (yep, just like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivore_%28software%29">CARNIVORE</a>).  Links and content are then fed into Facebook, organized by topic based on the keywords.  Some rudimentary analysis is performed (sentiment analysis at least, but as friendly as Microsoft is with the feds, and as LLMs have gotten popular, the influence of machines has probably expanded) and perused by agents, using some FBI internal interface.
</p>
<p>The TL;DR above probably implies this, but this is the longest post on here to date, by a wide margin.  I expect that most people will skip around instead of reading straight through:  probably only people running instances are going to be interested in the <a href="#Crash_course">technical parts</a>, and when building out <a href="#Who_is__a_href__https___boardreader_com___boardreader_com__a">the chronology</a> I erred on the side of providing too much information rather than simplifying.
</p>
<p><em>A note about links that go to fedi sites</em>:  some of them (like the main FSE site) are down, but if you put the links into your own instance's search box, you can generally find the post (if it federated; obviously if your instance is newer or if it's configured to scrub old posts, you might not have it) and view it on your own instance.  In either case, it's generally better to try searching for the post's URL on your home instance, whether that instance is currently live or not, because then you can interact with it locally.  (FSE is actually just a few commits from resuming federation, though being ready to use is a bit farther out.  Within the next few days, probably, it'll be possible to resume fetching objects from it; I have a couple of bugs to fix in the way Revolver stores users, though it's serving objects just fine.)
</p>
<h2 id="Root_Cause">Root Cause</h2>
<p>Pedophiles were showing up on FSE.  The rest of this section is background, the TL;DR is I had a problem getting pedophiles to stay away from FSE and I wanted to stop waking up in a cold sweat.  You can <a href="#Doing_some_digging">skip this bit</a> without missing much besides my woes and what I did about them.
</p>
<p>As far as I could reason, pedophiles were, besides being a problem themselves, the most likely reason for FSE to attract attention from law enforcement.  Nobody wants to host CP (or be in its vicinity) or get their gear seized because they fell asleep on the wheel and they let the pedos have free or they got CP-raided.  (If you are not familiar, this is a type of false-flag where a group of people floods a place with CP and then immediately alerts the FBI, usually done to get the site taken down.  Of course, you have to have it to upload it and usually if it results in any arrests, it results in the arrest of the attackers.)
</p>
<p>I was not happy about their arrival because, like with most fedi instances, it represented the primary existential threat to FSE, but as long as they weren't bothering any kids or uploading anything illegal, FSE has zero viewpoint censorship.  Almost invariably, they would immediately do something illegal.
</p>
<p>My initial suspicion was that they misunderstood the rules, the <a href="https://blog.freespeechextremist.com/blog/what-is-freedom-of-speech.html">meaning of freedom of speech</a>, something like that.  It turns out that a lot of them have a habit of just dumping illegal stuff <em>everywhere</em> and coming back in a week to see which accounts have been banned and which places have admins that are asleep (an approach that basically leaves no doubt that they are knowingly parasitic), then telling their friends", so you have to stay on top of it and get rid of them early, or they bring more.  It should not be a surprise that if someone's gratification is predicated on getting what they want without regard for who it hurts, that person is happy to engage in parasitic behavior like this:  violating a server and panicking an adult is no big deal if you're willing to violate a child and potentially ruin the kid's life.
</p>
<p>I'd like to also thank <a href="https://fba.ryona.agency/?domain=freespeechextremist.com">fediblock</a> for never fact-checking anything ever, <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/1d4b93bc31ef7f0923fa8ba902c64e48b1ca45f5725814b52f42c61b288cc004">giving the false impression</a> that <a href="https://blog.freespeechextremist.com/blog/the-loli-question.html">things that FSE has never permitted</a> were allowed.  FSE being fedi's equivalent of a dive bar, I understand people on "gated community" instances not wanting to deal with it (though <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/917fcd965d2a27d5b62f02494dc2e32cf11cfe6c8c965dda0b4c6d3beed234ec">it turns out</a> that instance-blocking is ham-fisted and just blocking a handful of accounts solves the problem), but I would prefer if they did not lie about their reasons or about me personally.  That sort of thing doesn't help when pedos show up having heard that there are no rules.  The blocks don't help them, either:  I've sent messages to admins on instances that were (hopefully unknowingly) hosting CP but got no response because they blocked FSE.  That's <em>their</em> problem, though; hope the block was worth it.
</p>
<p>It does mean that when <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/07/fbi-seizure-mastodon-server-wakeup-call-fediverse-users-and-hosts-protect-their">the FBI seized the kolektiva.social database backups</a>, nothing from FSE was in there.  As combative and block-happy as that instance was, very few other instances actually did make it into their database; for all anyone knows, the "accidental seizure" might have been just cover for a CI:  if the FBI wanted the database and the CI had it, serving an overly broad warrant lets them collect it without burning that informant.  I don't know anything about the people involved, but the FBI has used that tactic before.
</p>
<p>So when someone came looking for or attempting to provide CP I started just posting their IP and email and UA and whatever I had or could dig up.  (If you've punched a waiter, you can't complain that he refuses to bring you food.  Likewise with anyone trying to get me to host CP and then whining about me leaving them at the mercy of the internet.  I'm happy to care about your expectations for reasonable terms of service until you intentionally try something that you know is not just against the rules anywhere, but that can get the site eliminated and get me arrested.  I will do my best to discourage you from proceeding.)  I wanted to convey, completely unambiguously, that this is a hostile place to people doing that kind of thing:  the thing that <em>really</em> worries pedos is transparency.
</p>
<p>But it turns out that almost none of them were even paying attention:  they were just here to dump files or grab files and leave, or they expected to be banned 90% of the time and were looking for places where they didn't get banned.  So it didn't work, and I kept digging to figure out where they were coming from.
</p>
<h2 id="Doing_some_digging">Doing some digging</h2>
<p>If you are running an instance, it's even odds that you're doing it because you're interested in computers in general and the best way to learn is solving the problems that crop up.  This is great!  I have some helpful information; I post about it a lot but I haven't put it in one place.  Here is one place.  It's hopefully helpful to people that don't have a lot of experience with the topic and possibly has some bits that are of interest even to people that have been at this a long time.
</p>
<p>I've got a bigger piece about this in the larder but here's a survival guide:  it should give you enough that you can fill in the gaps by hitting the books, and enough of the technical background to understand the rest of the story.  It's a little dense in parts.
</p>
<h2 id="Why">Why?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of the documentation for any given piece of software ignores the problems that crop up:  coders like to think their software is painless and they treat information to the contrary as a bug in their code (or sometimes as a bug in the real world).  Pleroma and <a href="https://fedilist.com/source-code">similar software</a> also have two audiences:  users and people with their hands in the guts, and people with their hands in the guts need the real info.  But workarounds, real troubleshooting information, things like this are a little embarrassing to include.  "This is how much it'll tolerate before it breaks" is critical information, but the first thought a coder usually has is "It shouldn't break" and try to come up with a solution rather than document the tolerances.  (Eventually, <a href="https://aphyr.com/tags/Jepsen">everything breaks</a>.  You just don't know how much it takes or what happens when it breaks if you don't test it.)  Combine that with the the fact that most complaints come from people that expect the software to Just Work™ and you can expect that you won't get too many tips for learning how to deal with Weird, and if you run networked software that talks to the open internet, you will encounter Weird.  There are bots and scanners and worms, and as fedi grows, all servers become more interesting targets.  And if it's a high-traffic server with open registrations, you'll attract at least a little targeted attention.  (And of course, more if you call the server something like "freespeechextremist.com":  I may as well make the favicon a big, red bullseye.  But I like encountering Weird, so it's no trouble for me.)
</p>
<p>But the Weird is only weird until you have an answer, so between that and the paucity of documentation of the Weird (because it is nebulous, because coders often don't know all the bugs and if they do, they often don't like to document them, and because high-traffic servers are rare on fedi), your best bet is to get good at diagnostic tooling and analyzing data.  Half of running a server of any sort is being able to tell if something undesirable is going on and the other half is figuring out the shape of it.  (Actually fixing it tends to be trivial.)  That is, you come up with questions and then you figure out how to answer them.  A lot of the questions are going to be "Why is this slow?" or "Why did this stop working?" but if you understand the stream of logs, sometimes the questions are going to be "What the hell is <em>that</em>?"
</p>
<p>You want to be able to understand the logs directly, but you will also need to be able to understand them in aggregate and correlate them with other logs.  Luckily for you, it's all text streams and text files and Unix is <em>full</em> of tools for answering questions about text.  Here's the <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/2d50aa0f78a11a3b5d3cac3c5580a16085811bd3fd2db5fc6cd4322accdcc8e7">crash course</a>!
</p>
<h2 id="Crash_course">Crash course!</h2>
<p>This is dense but not difficult:  if you can set up Postgres and Pleroma and nginx, this material is all within your grasp.  Learn one of the things below and you will get some use out of it, and the use is exponential the more of them that you learn.
</p>
<p>If you know any scripting languages, you can learn enough awk for it to be useful in 30 minutes:  every awk program is <code>predicate1{action1} predicate2{action2} [...]</code>.  If you don't, you can probably pick up awk in a few hours.  (I'm serious, no exaggerating.  Do yourself a favor.)  If you combine this with <code>tail -f</code> and <code>mawk -Winteractive</code> then this is as much as you need in order to do real-time analysis of your log files.  I can't speak highly enough of awk's usefulness:  it's like the SQL of plain text.
</p>
<p>If you are any good with awk and some basic networking tools (dig, whois, traceroute, tcpdump, iftop), you know how to use datasets (<a href="https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/nro-delegated-stats">NRO delegated stats</a>, for example; whois on IPs will often give a geofeed URL, etc.) and services (whois again, <a href="https://blog.shodan.io/5-free-things-for-everybody/">Shodan</a> is a good start, DDG <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bangs">lists several services</a> that it integrates), it's possible to figure out just from your webserver logs who is who, when someone signed up (grep the logs for the <code>POST</code> to the accounts endpoint), from where, whether or not it was a <a href="https://check.torproject.org/exit-addresses">Tor exit</a> or proxy, what language they have told their browser to say they speak, things like that.  There is no shortage of tools for network exploration, and the more you learn about how the Internet works, the better you'll be able to use them.  That should suffice:  do a few hours of reading and you have just put your competence into the top 10% of fedi admins, and learned some things that you can apply anywhere.
</p>
<p>nginx, lighttpd, Apache httpd, and almost all of the other webservers that are popular to set in front of fedi for load-balancing or caching or filtering or rate-limiting, they all have a some directives that allow you to control the format of the logfiles, log arbitrary headers, timing information.  It's not always necessary, but keep it in your pocket for when you need it.  With FSE (and other servers I run, not just fedi stuff), I usually strip most of the quote marks added in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format">common log format</a>, I add a lot of timing information (especially time required to get a response from the backend).  I also use tabs, effectively making the log files a big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values">TSV</a>:  the extra space makes the files a little easier to read visually, a little simpler to use with awk, but also opens up the tooling options:  R, sed, sort, nearly anything can read TSVs.  Read the output of grep into irb or some other REPL that's good at string-mangling; set <code>IFS</code> and pipe it into a <code>while read line</code> loop in bash.  Or if you have some favorite spreadsheet software, they can all read TSVs (but you'll probably want to filter it or split it into chunks unless you have the kind of spreadsheet software that doesn't choke on a 20GB file).  (Of course, because I deal with 20GB files, the tooling I use <a href="https://livefreeordichotomize.com/posts/2019-06-04-using-awk-and-r-to-parse-25tb/index.html">can handle pretty big files</a>.)  In fact, although awk is like SQL for delimited text, you can even use regular SQL:  <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/sqlite/one-line-csv-operations">sqlite3 can operate on text pipelines</a>.  And if you're good with SQL, check the man page for psql:  you can have it emit TSVs pretty easily!  A full SQL tutorial would take longer than awk, but SQL is very useful to pick up.
</p>
<p>Really simple numerical analysis is indispensable when you are looking for aberrances:  the Weird sticks out.  If you're tailing the logs and piping that somewhere, you can keep a running average and calculate standard deviations and find the outliers.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule">68, 95, 99.7</a>:  calculate the standard deviation of your window, and you can find things that stick out.  (In awk, this is really concise, since it keeps track of line—technically "record"—numbers automatically:  <code>{a[NR%1000]=$0}</code> keeps the last thousand records in the array <code>a</code>.)  Some endpoints start to get a disproportionate amount of traffic out of nowhere, some IPs show up out of nowhere and flood you.  Finding things that stick out is the point of data analysis.  (This is the sort of tool I was writing/using when I would post things like "90% of the POSTs are coming from the same address".)  On fedi, network-based DDoS tends to be more popular than targeting specific endpoints; if you see <a href="https://techhub.social/users/Drand">someone suddenly hammering TWKN</a>, and it's probably <a href="https://nya.social/notes/818c3d1bdb3e20788eb08e25">a scraper</a>.  (Probably!)
</p>
<p>The last thing to learn is when you're being too paranoid:  sometimes it's not a DDoS, someone just linked to a post from a popular site like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</a>, sometimes <a href="https://nya.social/notes/818c3d1bdb3e20788eb08e25">an idiot wrote the scraper and doesn't understand rate-limiting</a>.  (Always include a mechanism to limit the rate, even if you are making <a href="https://git.freespeechextremist.com/gitweb/?p=embot;a=blob;f=embot;h=21a11493cec9b361ee54884dd3de10fce8750cb2;hb=HEAD#l220">a trivial Markov bot</a>.)  Sometimes, it's just someone trying to write a new client and the client has a bug:  fedi is exciting like that, there are hackers all over.
</p>
<h2 id="Scar_Tissue">Scar Tissue</h2>
<p>Over time, running a service, you bump into problems, and your service grows solutions to those problems, and you keep the solutions around so that you don't have the same problem twice.  The service acquires scar tissue, reminders of problems, marks that distinguish it from a new service.  (The scar tissue is one of the reasons that you encounter so many surprises when doing a big rewrite.)
</p>
<p>Early in FSE's history, we had some malicious signups:  just normal spammers.  I view captchas as hostile to legitimate users and ineffective (and of course, <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/captchaboy/pleroma_captcha_solver">Pleroma's captchas have been cracked</a> since then).  Likewise with email verification, except that expecting a real email isn't just hostile design, it's also a privacy risk.  There's a tradeoff there:  I have to manually generate password resets if people forget them, FSE can't send out email notifications, things like that, but on the other hand, someone that wants email addresses isn't going to target FSE, and in the event FSE <em>is</em> compromised, the email addresses aren't leaked.  (If someone has an email address and a password, the first thing they'll do is try to use that combination on other services.  If they don't have a real email address, though, they can't.)  But there are a lot of tradeoffs you have to make and people that don't like the ones I made can make different servers or join different ones.
</p>
<p>There's work stuff where, if you can use an off-the-shelf solution to a problem, that's usually what you want; it's generally an explicit policy to spend as little time as possible on things that aren't part of your core business.  That's reasonable but I don't think web applications have gotten <em>more</em> reliable in the decade and a half since this became conventional wisdom, so maybe it's worth considering the emergent properties of this kind of policy.  So when I'm on my own, a project where I have no boss and no reason to compromise, I generally roll my own solutions.  I like coding anyway so it's not a costly experiment, and these solutions generally end up faster, more reliable, and more flexible; aside from that, I'm not at a vendor's mercy for bugfixes.  (There are always bugs.  The difference is whether I've got to try to find them in someone else's 200kLOC codebase or in my own 4-line script.  Additionally, you can guess whether it's faster to bash a four-line script into the text editor or tweak a 400-line config file.)
</p>
<p>So I needed a way to tamp down on the spam without making the site suck:  my solution was to tail the logs, send them through an awk script, and it would just email me when it saw someone do <code>POST /api/v1/accounts</code> and get a 200 back.  Eventually I expanded the script and it would do things like check <code>pidof xlock</code> as a reasonable approximation of whether I was at my desk and if xlock wasn't running, it would pipe <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/4741d89afcf57973a9afcc973a43804a6ce4e6134b96d38dcd87173ed5b1e9e9">a message</a> through <code>espeak -s120 -v other/en-sc</code>.  (I call him "scotbot".  As you can hear, I did have it correctly pluralize "user" but forgot to change "there are" to "there is" when only one occurred.)  At some point, we got a really big hit, and I had nginx rate-limit signups to one per minute.  Later on, I did the welcomebot, so new signups would be announced in public.
</p>
<p>So I would keep an eye on new users arriving:  usually it was just merry shiptoasters, but once in a while I see a pedo show and this sets off the self-preservation instincts, so I dump the stuff they've done and if they are still there and I haven't had to hit the red button yet (that is, they haven't done <code>POST /api/v1/media</code> yet, compelling me to kill off their IP and account and delete all of the shit they uploaded), I can watch them move around, look at what they are searching for.
</p>
<p>The pedos would land on a page, some post or something, usually a local mirror of a post from another instance, then they'd sign up, start mashing search terms into the box (which is usually how I noticed them:  some search terms were added to an awk script that would ping me), follow a handful of accounts, and usually just leave.  A peculiar thing stuck out:  a lot of them were coming from <a href="https://boardreader.com/">boardreader.com</a>, based on the <code>Referer</code> header, so I tugged on that thread, and that thread turned out to be the weird one.
</p>
<h2 id="Who_is__a_href__https___boardreader_com___boardreader_com__a">Who is <a href="https://boardreader.com/">boardreader.com</a>?</h2>
<p>I'd never heard of them, so I looked around, and <a href="https://boardreader.com/">boardreader.com</a> was a strange site indeed:  very barebones, didn't work over Tor, no contact information listed anywhere.  (Some time in the interim, they added a SocialGist banner at the bottom...that goes to a 404 now that SocialGist has moved.)  I bashed in some of the search queries that the pedos had used on FSE and was pretty horrified to find the posts they landed on, all of which originated on other servers, but all of which were also ascribed to FSE.
</p>
<p>It turns out that BoardReader was a tool for searching forums.  The authors don't appear to understand what fedi is, so they had treated FSE as a forum, and all of the public posts that came to FSE from elsewhere as forum posts made on some forum called "freespeechextremist.com".
</p>
<p>Apparently it was a small search index for forums and it got big enough to be bought by a Japanese company, the two founders had issues with the new owners, and the company eventually was sloughed off and acquired by <a href="https://socialgist.com/">SocialGist</a> (which now redirects you to <a href="https://www.socialgist.ai/">socialgist.ai</a>).  SocialGist purports to sell "accessible social data", they list <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230201153015/https://socialgist.com/data-sources/">several data sources</a>, and per <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250124110504/https://socialgist.com/blog/">their blog</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240415001121/https://blog.socialgist.com/understanding-how-we-find-data">their developers are in Serbia</a>, which lines up with the IP they were using, so I've started thinking I've got the right people.
</p>
<p>Most of the search results indicated that long ago, BoardReader identified itself in the User-Agent header and most of the targets viewed it as hostile:  it's present on a lot of lists of poorly behaved bots.  There are also complaints about it on a lot of forums, and there are threads where people are asking how to stop it; in those threads, some people show up from nowhere and suggest that the person running the board should be grateful for the traffic bump.  (If you owned a search engine for discussion boards, wouldn't you use it to search for mentions of your engine?  And if you were running a somewhat aggressive crawler that was annoying people, it's a matter of temperament to decide whether to ask what would bother people less versus showing up to argue with them.  I give it even odds that those posts were made by owners or employees at BoardReader itself.)
</p>
<h2 id="BoardReader_and_FSE">BoardReader and FSE</h2>
<h2 id="2023_03_05__Sunday">2023-03-05 (Sunday)</h2>
<p>I went over and grepped the logs to see if they'd been to FSE:  nothing.  But they had to be getting data from FSE:  they had posts from other instances and links to FSE.  So I kept looking and found a large amount of scraping on <code>/api/v1/timelines/public?local=false</code> from a browser claiming to be Chrome, and coming through way faster than a human could scroll even if they were leaning on the Page Down key.
</p>
<p>spider1.boardreader.com through spider43 all had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types#A">A records</a>, but traffic was coming through 45.15.176.187 (which was, at the time, <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/b110271c6ec2ed688cbbce406a6a1ca9379145ec3d54ba2c7a73927970df47dc">owned by DediPath</a>).  That was odd, right:  why would BoardReader go to the trouble of making A records for their spiders and then go through some other service?
</p>
<p>So, I tell the server to drop traffic from the IPs that were scraping.  Problem solved!  Then immediately I start seeing a large number of attempts from different IPs.  Residential IPs in the US:  they're buying residential proxies.  It's one thing to lie in the User-Agent header, but it's a step past that to pay money to evade detection.  Someone that has money to burn wants FSE scraped, probably a business.  At this point I'm certain enough that it's BoardReader.  I dash off a quick email to <a href="mailto:info@boardreader.com">info@boardreader.com</a> asking for information on their crawler.  Since they are going to lengths to hide what they are doing, I don't expect much, but it doesn't hurt.
</p>
<h2 id="2023_03_08__Wednesday">2023-03-08 (Wednesday)</h2>
<p>So I need an automated approach if they're automatically hopping proxies.  <code>awk</code> and <code>iptables</code> plus a really quick Ruby script to sit between nginx and Pleroma for that endpoint, and I can start dropping traffic from any IP that tries to hit FSE with that token.  If I keep it there, I'll exhaust their proxies before they fill their cache.
</p>
<p>Eventually, the requests dry up and I see a request from an IP owned by a Serbian ISP that leads back to <a href="https://devtools.boardreader.com/">devtools.boardreader.com</a>.  It acts like a normal browser:  it loads all the resources, grabs a Bearer token, executes JavaScript, and subsequent to that, the scraping resumes using that token.  They're trying to play back a browser session:  that's clever.  Watching the logs confirms it:  bots using that token start arriving, playing back the sequence of requests, and then hammering the hell out of the public timeline again.  To verify, I wander back through their site and see that they are indeed getting new posts from that batch of requests.
</p>
<p>I start severely limiting TWKN by cranking the rate-limiting way up.  At this point, it starts throwing 429s even at legitimate users, so I finally <a href="https://freespeechextremist.com/objects/8061b855-1dd7-4fbb-95de-cd812dd04a49">talked about the problem in public some</a> after mostly keeping it to myself or in DMs.  (And, of course, writing this has made me regret not having taken notes with timestamps.  I've had to piece everything together from scattered notes, timestamps on scripts and logs, DMs, etc.  The first draft of this post was missing some information and had the chronology wrong.)
</p>
<p>BoardReader is sneaky and annoying and using fraudulent means to extract data from FSE over my objections, but now thay I can isolate their traffic, I can I try a lot of different approaches.  They aren't going to get any legitimate data again, but I can see how their crawler behaves.  I start just sending back 429s:  their scraper responds by sending <em>more</em> requests.  Apparently, if it doesn't get the response it wants, it just repeats the request immediately, no delay.  Rude, but they have some confidence in their ability to get around restrictions, so they don't have to be polite.  But this is worse:  they send the reqs back so fast that it actually saturates the pipe, it's basically a worse DoS than before.  Unsurprisingly, sending back 401s, 403s, 500s, same result.  So I start just sending <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-10.4.3">402 Payment Required</a>, an idea I got from <a href="https://poa.st/users/graf">graf</a>.  Unfortunately, this means no one gets anything from TWKN for a while.
</p>
<h2 id="2023_03_13__Monday">2023-03-13 (Monday)</h2>
<p>...And that's when they finally get back to me.  I had sent an email to <a href="mailto:info@boardreader.com">info@boardreader.com</a> on the 5th telling them that I was looking for information on their crawler, and on the 13th, after the server has started adamantly refusing to I finally get an email from <a href="mailto:dave@socialgist.com">dave@socialgist.com</a> asking what I want to know.  Noncommittal.  I reply to him a few hours later, at 20:45 UTC, explaining the problem and telling him if he wants to index that he'll need to only fetch local posts and use a UA that identifies BoardReader.  He tells me at 21:01 that he'll forward it to the engineering team and asks what domains I'd like them to quit crawling.  I give the entire IP range that I owned and complain about the pedophiles.  While we're corresponding, their developers are still scraping and actively debugging the scraper, so I mention that he could save them some time.  I can another Serbian IP address.  Over email, I offer to talk to their devs, I pass a few links to <a href="https://fedilist.com/">FediList</a> (which was still on the <code>demo.</code> subdomain at the time), I try to explain how fedi works.

<p>So obviously I don't trust them.  Dave stops replying to emails, and they're not only ''still' scraping, but they are trying to get around the countermeasures:  SocialGist is lying.  They're actively putting work into continuing to do something they've promised to stop doing:  they can't get anything out of TWKN (the last real post they got from FSE was on the 8th), and they're doing their damnedest to try to rectify this, while telling me that they'll stop.  If they felt really good about it, they'd have no reason to lie, so either their motivations are not what what they say, or the person I'm dealing with is not the same person that has decided to put FSE on the list and then told the devs to make sure they can get posts from it.
</p>
<h2 id="Then_the_FBI_shows_up">...Then the FBI shows up</h2>
<h2 id="2023_03_14__Tuesday">2023-03-14 (Tuesday)</h2>
<p>The morning after Dave ghosted me, I got <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/1e24f117e3892a83e9f998f5fb636a3b99711e27e3ff37743f20746708b1b6e4">an email</a> from an fbi.gov email address, the subject line "Emergency Disclosure Request", and this in the body:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is Special Agent Peter Christenson, with the FBI. I am requesting subscriber information for the user "WitchKingOfAngmar." This user posted the attached threat. Please let me know if you can assist with this request.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It also includes <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/8601d634946331754840b13513cddfabcf559f4e2f62122d72c4015c5e57390e">FSE Screen Shot.PNG</a>.  I've never seen someone outside fedi refer to freespeechextremist.com as FSE, so my first thought is it was a prank, but the headers and my mail server's logs and the SPF info for fbi.gov all indicated that this was a real email from the place it claimed to be from.
</p>
<p>This was the attached screenshot, which, despite being labeled "FSE Screen Shot", is not a screenshot of FSE:
</p>
<img src="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/8601d634946331754840b13513cddfabcf559f4e2f62122d72c4015c5e57390e" alt="Not a screenshot of FSE">
<p>So after I was reasonably certain that it was a legitimate email, my first reaction was to rack my brain trying to remember who the hell "WitchKingOfAngmar" was.  He didn't sound familiar to me.  I checked and this was a user at <a href="https://sneed.social/">sneed.social</a> (which was dead for a long time, but appears to have <a href="https://fedilist.com/instance/sneed.social">come back recently</a>).  The screenshot had some interesting bits in it.  For one thing, despite being named "FSE Screen Shot", FSE has never looked like that.  It also described FSE as a "forum".  In fact, the top said "Forum • Blackrock Executiv...".  Some text is highlighted, "kill blackrock" "larry fink", as if those were search terms.  There was also some rudimentary sentiment analysis.  The post itself was from 26 days before the email was sent, but the screenshot read "11 hours ago" and "13 hours".  (So much for "Emergency" from the subject line, but it also indicates that it takes two hours for a post to go through whatever that system is.)
</p>
<p>Obviously, you don't expect to receive an email from the FBI, so it took me a minute to figure out what to make of it.  WitchKingOfAngmar's post was clearly a threat but it was also clearly absurd, an obvious joke, not a credible threat.  And obviously, he wrote it to troll the admins of the site.
</p>
<p>I know a couple of pretty good lawyers in case anything crazy happens, but the goal is always to make sure that nothing crazy happens.  So, best-case scenario, everything from FSE is public:  if you can't see it, I don't have it.  Ideally, the FBI gets that and I don't have to do any convincing.  Worst-case scenario is they kick in the door and grab the server.  They'd need a warrant to do that, and they wouldn't ask politely if they had a warrant already...unless they were trying to get me to say no or they were trying to see how I respond.
</p>
<p>Dealing with law enforcement is usually an uphill battle to convince a person afflicted with motivated reason of the obvious.  They are looking for something, their job performance is predicated on finding it, and when that's the case, it's hard to get them to look at something that isn't the thing they're looking for, even if that thing demonstrates very clearly that what they are looking for is not here.
</p>
<p>On top of that, I'm paranoid.  I go ask the dead spacemen for their thoughts and one of them points out that posting about it might count as obstruction and the FBI had lately been somewhat zealous about obstruction charges.  (Good to have solid friends with level heads.)
</p>
<p>And the previous day, fresh on my mind because the memes were flying, <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/9c7e72e28d6b8f9add669ef70f40ded4bba81bde46e6726537f63f2caea47fac">Mike Chitwood</a> (mostly notable for <a href="https://www.mambaonline.com/2017/06/06/newspaper-outs-18-men-arrested-cruising-florida-parks/">publicizing mugshots of people arrested for, though not convicted of, cruising</a>, part of his <a href="https://edramatica.com/The_Daytona_Nine">long-running battle to stop gay dudes in Daytona Beach since at least 2006</a>) had just <a href="https://www.volusiasheriff.gov/news/volusia-county-sheriff/video-new-jersey-man-identified-arrested-following-online-threat-to-murder-sheriff-chitwood.stml">had Richard Golden extradited</a> for saying "Just shoot him in the head" on, uh, apparently it was "<a href="https://www.news-journalonline.com/story/news/crime/2023/03/15/richard-golden-what-we-know-about-the-new-jersey-man-accused-of-threatening-sheriff-mike-chitwood/70012169007/">a 4CHAN chatroom, a communications platform shared by extremist groups</a>".  (Informed citizens may recognize 4chan as <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/e427aa87b4a334f0ed4f59f6ab2485cf4e9bbd381fa8bc5353a495a80040e0f2">a far-left website</a> as well.)  It is kind of interesting that Chitwood used the same "eradicating scumbags" language about neo-Nazi propagandists and gay dudes bangin' in the woods.  But anyway, I couldn't help noticing that there had just been a case where cops were getting excited about anonymous internet threats.
</p>
<p>The timing was a little obvious:  they got it from BoardReader.  I go and find the post on BoardReader, to make sure it's in their index.  It is:
</p>
<img src="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/1337eade3854b2802404520b99448300a920d821cff0c5d1ba9f8599f7944c02" title="Fans of long-ass hashes may notice that this one starts with 1337!" alt="Exactly the same shit the FBI sent me, just a different UI.">
<p>The odds that the FBI and BoardReader would screw up the Unicode in exactly the same way are pretty low.  (The original Unicode codepoints, 1f9e2, 1f438, and 1f44d, got turned into question mark boxes indicating invalid Unicode.  BoardReader's codebase being a mess of PHP, no surprise.)  A common glitch is not absolute, but there is the other unlikely mistake, that a post from somewhere else is ascribed to FSE.  Guess now I know why Dave ghosted:  they're scraping for the FBI, he can't turn it off.  Legally, the FBI can't pay a private organization to do something that they can't do, but if the organization is doing something on their own and the FBI "doesn't" (<em>cough</em>) know and doesn't ask, they're just buying access to a stream of data, not paying someone to violate the CFAA.
</p>
<p>🧢🐸👍</p>
<p>I had been saying for a while that the three-letter agencies don't really "get" fedi.  Decentralized networks take some explaining to regular people, but individuals can get them.  But there's a long way from an individual understanding it to an organization understanding it.  (If you haven't ever worked in a stultifying bureaucracy, think about the amount of time that passes between a rumor propagating through your extended family and any sort of concrete change in behavior propagating.  Something can be obvious to everyone and still not obvious to the organization as a whole.)  Apparently the <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/faa13e7f66b7ff9e97634aaf04f6fd4faab95cf3931080fd03b0d98d76c7df2a?name=hydra-on-the-web.pdf">German feds</a> get it and the feds in the US are <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/835374c1bfa10895663d4d1c94500049823ea928fb7e9c47b01a6b7f8f07c091?name=nsf-staff-report.pdf">starting to get it</a>.  But this more or less confirmed it:  SocialGist doesn't understand what fedi is, really, and the FBI saw "It came from this website" and they just rolled with it.
</p>
<p>So I get my head together and reply, explaining that since the guy was on another server, I don't have the information he is looking for, that BoardReader wrote "Free Speech Extremist" on the post but that it didn't come from FSE.  And, miraculously, that works:  he asks who to ask, I tell him to check the origin server, and ask him if he'd rather I not discuss the exchange in public, with no response.
</p>
<h2 id="2023_03_15__Wednesday">2023-03-15 (Wednesday)</h2>
<p>BoardReader is still hammering FSE and getting only 402s in response.
</p>
<p>Still corresponding with Special Agent Christenson, but no reply until East Coast business hours start.  (My last email was 15:50 on the 14th in LA, 18:50 in Quantico.)  The last email is him saying thanks, I ask him one more time if it would bother the FBI if I said something, and nothing.  In the mean time, I've been alternating between disappearing from fedi and running around TWKN being twitchy and paranoid while the actual endpoint is spewing errors.  It's better to be transparent and I usually am but people are asking questions.  The FBI guy probably can't say "Sure, write whatever, here's a selfie!" but if they wanted me not to say anything, he could definitely tell me not to say anything, so I figure it's fine.  On the other hand, the whole thing still made no sense.  (Maybe it made no sense to him either and he was just doing what his boss said.)  So I give a limited explanation and a promise to deliver a full explanation, then wait for the flashbang to come through my window, because, although I was certain I wasn't doing anything wrong or illegal, I am really paranoid:
</p>

</p>
<p>I realize that was a screenshot of a very long post in the middle of a very long article; you'll notice that it ends with an announcement that FSE is going into lockdown until further notice:  no viewing TWKN or public timelines without an account, and registrations closed.  I recommended everyone else do the same.  I hate doing that and I hate when other instances do it, but a lot of instances follow suit.

<p>I'm on the edge of my seat, watching BoardReader continue to fail to get around the wall of 402s.  (As verifying the bearer token means a round-trip to the DB, I'm still mostly kicking them out by using nginx, along with a pile of awk scripts that .)  They're using residential proxies, they're using Tor, they're rotating the User-Agent strings every request  No word from them <em>or</em> the FBI for a week.
</p>
<p>I don't say much beyond the public post, but I ping the admin of sneed.social and ask him if the FBI agent contacted him, I send him the link to my post.  (I didn't know him, but everyone said he was reasonable to deal with when it was something like this, and he was.)  He goes to check his email, says that he'll reach out, and remarks that the user in question was actively trying to get banned, due to some other issue; I didn't ask.

<p>This dissipates pretty quickly:  the fed checks it out because he's got to, but it's pretty obvious, isn't it?  Your guess is as good as mine with regards to why no one was arrested for sending the FBI a false report.

<p>There are a couple of bits worth including here, so I'll quote them.  I've <a href="https://blog.freespeechextremist.com/blog/on-human-bots.html">mentioned this before on the blog</a>, but the tone on fedi is significantly less formal (one is less likely to tell the same joke at work on Monday morning that they told at the bar on Friday night), so please bear with me while I quote myself.  If you're unfamiliar with the slang, a "fedpost" is a post that includes threats of violence, and a "glowie" is a federal agent.  These terms are usually used humorously.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can't find any other fedi instances on there, but this is a pretty annoying scraper to get rid of.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This hasn't changed; as far as I know, FSE is the only one they were scraping.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The glowies are (or want to convey that they are) specifically looking at threats against Blackrock executives.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out that "want to convey that they are" was correct, but I didn't know that until much later.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember everyone that was freaking out about the various search engines on fedi, most recently as:Public? Remember that I keep saying that there are scrapers getting at fedi *without* identifying themselves? It turns out that I was right and this is because I AM A GODDAMN GENIUS and EVERYONE THAT HAS EVER TOLD ME THAT I AM WRONG IS A RETARDED COPROPHILIAC. There are scrapers getting data out of fedi without identifying themselves and at least one of them is selling data to the FBI.

<p>This has still not sunk in for most of the people that are worried about, e.g., Archive Team, as:Public, FediList, etc.  (Especially the text in all-caps.)  I have linked to some other cases above.

<p>It is important to note here that <em>every</em> sentence in the following paragraph is <em>completely</em> wrong.
</p>
<p>It looked like the situation with the FBI was over and they had what they wanted.  They were just following up on some idiot making a random threat on the internet.  So the balance remaining was just mopping-up and getting BoardReader off my back.  That shouldn't be too difficult!

<p>Despite promising to stop, BoardReader hasn't just kept scraping, but they are still trying to debug their scraper so that it can resume collecting posts:

<p>I've been keeping track of traffic referred to FSE by BoardReader.  Unsurprisingly, this post, written by a Markov bot that lives on a completely different server (and as always, attributed to FSE by BoardReader), is the most frequent URL that people land on if they come from BoardReader:
</p>

<p>Anyone that is putting search terms into BoardReader and getting <em>that</em> post is someone that I would like to discourage from signing up.
</p>
<h2 id="2023_03_24__Friday__and_subsequent_weeks">2023-03-24 (Friday) and subsequent weeks</h2>
<p>Clearly, sending them emails and making sure that they can't scrape were not working, and they're still trying to fix their scraper, they're still hammering the API endpoint for fetching the posts.  Pedophiles are still landing on FSE, coming from boardreader.com.  That was the issue from the beginning, and it's been weeks.  I want to open the timelines back up, re-open registrations.  We've been on lockdown too long!  Plus, the site is slow as hell because BoardReader is choking my server (even though they're getting no data, they're still sending multiple requests per second), and on top of that, I'm paying bandwidth overage charges.
</p>
<p>Since I've talked to them and got them to agree and I've stopped sending them data, and they're still trying to get around the restrictions and still sending pedophiles, I've exhausted reasonable methods.
</p>
<p>So I grab some samples of the timeline, and bash out a small <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100127161358/http://hoohoo.ncsa.illinois.edu/cgi/">CGI script</a>:  it just does string substitutions, mashing together accounts that do not exist and generating posts that do not exist.  (Initially the IDs were just random 32-bit numbers.  Eventually half the number varied per post and half was derived from the timestamp of the request, so I could trace the posts through BoardReader more easily.)  I don't bother making the URLs match actual Pleroma URLs:  why would I?  They just have to be unique.  I also have to start up <a href="https://www.lighttpd.net/">lighttpd</a> to serve it:  FSE uses nginx, but since nginx doesn't support CGI scripts (a travesty), I've got to send the requests for that endpoint to lighttpd.  Because I was still all the way in awk mode, of course I just used awk.  For fun, I grabbed some lists of words to include in the posts:  some based on search terms people had used on BoardReader, and then rounded out with the CARNIVORE list.  (First search result; I don't know if it was the real list or not but it didn't really matter.)
</p>
<p>It worked:  you can see <a href="https://archive.is/aDKNA">an archived sample of the gibberish</a> or a <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/1d4a30d103f90230ad734aa74e80ef292194a5ad4551946f4a3d4c529ea80831">screenshot of different gibberish</a>.  Of course, it worked beautifully:
</p>
<img src="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/1fb168a7c52fa9324326c4c0026488d2088e6493daadff22bdc8a825d606be75" alt="Searching for FSE posts on boardreader.com just gives gibberish">
<p>The only problem was that the scraper loved it <em>too</em> much.  We were suddenly getting DoS'd by their scraper.  So I built in a little delay and then had a fun idea:  jam the BoardReader search terms in.  And I saw something <em>really</em> weird very suddenly:
</p>
<img src="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/7fd1ea217eb279e31a4fae7a6a976fa5be00e5bf65d8b7dfbf322b6b92fd99be" alt="timestamps and a large number of blue 4s and hyphens, explained below">
<p>This is an awk script that draws a histogram of the requests coming into FSE.  The basic idea is really simple:  the first version of it just printed a "." and then when the timestamp changed, it printed a newline, too.  This draws a histogram for you of the number of requests per second, in real-time if you can convince awk not to buffer excessively (e.g., <code>mawk -Winteractive</code>).  By this time, it had gotten somewhat more sophisticated:  the hyphens represent requests that received a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-10.2">2xx status code</a>, the blue hyphens representing POST requests and the others GETs.  When the request resulted in some other status code, the first digit was printed.  The end of the line contains summary data:  number of requests that second in brackets, followed by the number of 5xx errors, followed by the ratio of server errors to total requests (as a fraction and a percentage) and the average number of requests per second.  Like many scripts that were unreasonably useful and then gew bit by bit (usually under duress, while trying to fix a problem with the server), it is nearly unreadable but is surprisingly compact and reliable.  (<a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/1965c57f5e3becafa64b68431d9d279ed6f7bcfcd94933c08a0f2496c8f1fb37">Here is the version that I was running when I took the screenshot</a> for the curious; you probably won't get any direct use out of it unless you're using the same logfile format as me, but if you can read it, it should be pretty straightforward:  it's messy, but not complex.)
</p>
<p>The big field of green-on-blue 4s sticks out:  those are requests that resulted in a 402, in this case almost all originating from Facebook, and all of them requesting URLs matching the fake posts.  Facebook shouldn't have been crawling FSE's public timeline.
</p>
<p>You might have noticed that the random IDs were present in the posts:  the script generating the random gibberish didn't keep any history, because I didn't want the problem of storing infinite random gibberish, but I could match posts on BoardReader to URLs in the webserver logs by just pasting these random IDs into the search form on BoardReader.  So I dropped IDs from the posts into the BoardReader search box, and that more or less confirmed it:  Facebook was fetching these posts shortly after BoardReader indexed them.  Apparently BoardReader was giving Facebook a feed of their data, but it wasn't just that:  there was a common thread in the gibberish, a pattern in the posts that Facebook was interested in.  You can probably guess the hypothesis, the test, and the result:  I opened up the CGI script and, where there had been a long, random list of words to cram into the posts, I replaced it with just one phrase:  "larry fink".
</p>
<p>Almost as soon as I saved the file, Facebook started flooding my server.  I wanted my keystrokes to start echoing again so I un-did it, replacing the list with the previous version except without "larry fink", and the flow slowed to a trickle and then stopped.  Curiosity got the best of me so I re-did it, and after the wait for Boardreader to index it, the flood resumed.
</p>
<p>So the pipeline was my terrible awk script generating JSON that represented gibberish posts, and that went out through lighttpd, then nginx, then it left my machine and went into BoardReader's crawlers, from there into their index (however that was built) and straight out to Facebook, and presumably from there to the FBI, and from there into whatever UI that was that they were using to search.  (Zuckerberg had just testified in Congress that Facebook was critical national infrastructure:  maybe he wasn't lying.)
</p>
<h2 id="Further_Shenanigans">Further Shenanigans</h2>
<p>How <em>do</em> you get BoardReader to stop?  I couldn't get them to respond to emails and filling their database with gibberish wasn't helping.
</p>
<p>So I shoved some more delays in:  eventually I spaced out the writes until they were a trickle designed to finish exactly one second before the timeout happened.  That solved the bandwidth overages:  they were just using a trickle.  For fun, I tossed in a little more randomness:  once in a while, I'd omit some random characters from the end so that it wouldn't parse.  Maybe if the error rate spiked, they'd notice.  You can get partial data out of something like that if you're using an event-based parser or you've structured it to use coroutines or thunks or whatever; the type of thing that builds up a data structure piecemeal and leaves you with a valid (if incomplete) data structure (and this approach can let you work with JSON structures that are too big to fit in memory, of course), but the overwhelming majority of JSON parsers just take a string and give you a data structure or an error:  it's easier to call something like that.  It looks like BoardReader is using the common type, so they spend about a minute on a single request and end up with no useful data.  The situation stays <a href="https://archive.is/U0CNN">exactly like that</a> for a while.
</p>
<p>It's annoying, but I don't have to worry about it too often.  I pop in and tweak the random timeline script's output or its behavior once in a while.  And then I have a pretty evil idea:  I just start putting Dave's phone number into the randomly generated posts.  The following morning I get a reply from Dave:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hey peter, sorry for the radio silence. i've filed a jira ticket this week and hopefully will have an answer for you shortly. if we need any more information i'll loop in one of our engineers.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guess it worked!  We go back and forth very briefly and they stop scraping pretty quickly, though it takes about a week for them to get FSE out of their index.  It shouldn't take a week for that to happen; whether they were stalling or it actually took that long, I probably won't find out.
</p>
<h2 id="Epilogue___Torswats">Epilogue:  Torswats</h2>
<p>The story wrapped up just short of a year after it started, in a very unexpected way.
</p>
<h2 id="2024_01_18">2024-01-18</h2>
<p>Alan Winston Filion of Lancaster, CA—not too far from <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/3bb1dad6a6d79223a2b49222bc03ab431734f4686acb5029722f2f16aabf61d5">my home</a>—is arrested:  <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alan-filion-torswats-swatting-arrest/">https://www.wired.com/story/alan-filion-torswats-swatting-arrest/</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/torswats-swatting-arrest/">https://www.wired.com/story/torswats-swatting-arrest/</a>.
</p>
<p>Torswats.  The guy responsible for creating hundreds of bomb scares, fake hostage situations.  This was essentially a griefing tactic, and he had a long enough run that he was able to build up a little business making anonymous calls to the police and the FBI.
</p>
<p>It turns out that that's who the FBI was looking for.  That was "WitchKingOfAngmar", which apparently is a "Lord of the Rings" reference.  That was why they were so interested in threats against Larry Fink:  apparently, Torswats had a habit of tirades full of nonsensical threats against Larry Fink.  Apparently there's a lot of information about Torswats on KiwiFarms:  <a href="https://archive.ph/yqwuA">https://archive.ph/yqwuA</a>.
</p>
<p>And that's it:  most of the things that didn't make sense about the story fit together after that.  There are still some murky bits:  what is BoardReader at present?  Just a front to give a plausible excuse to SocialGist to scrape?  Around 2010, scraping social media to find ISIS recruitment got popular, and of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM">PRISM</a> was the logical conclusion of that:  is BoardReader even a legitimate site at this point, or just the forum-scraping division of SocialGist?  What was Facebook doing in the pipeline?  Are they providing the FBI with tools for this kind of thing or do they just act as a convenient repository for this kind of data?
</p>
<h2 id="An_Aside___Some_Advice_for_Shady_Jagoffs">An Aside:  Some Advice for Shady Jagoffs</h2>
<p>The best advice is the advice that you are almost guaranteed not to take:  don't scrape fedi, it's evil.
</p>
<p>If you want data from fedi, just make a fake instance and cram it onto a bunch of <a href="https://fedilist.com/instance?software=activityrelay">relays</a>.  You're still a shady jagoff, but at least you don't break anyone else's server, it's easier than scraping, and the data gets delivered to you in real-time and dumped in your database rather than you having to make some Rube Goldberg system to extract it from unwilling participants.
</p>
<p>I usually make a remark like "I wonder why they don't do this" but I can't be sure they're not:  how <em>would</em> you know if anyone actually is doing that?  Maybe the only scrapers we know about are the noisy ones doing conventional scraping and the other ones don't make enough noise to cause problems.  People only noticed newjack.city because it was full of followbots, but you don't need to use followbots any more.  There are several varieties of <a href="https://fedilist.com/source-code">ActivityPub relay and ActivityPub software</a> and some of them lend themselves to repurposing as a scraper.  As demonstrated by <a href="https://fedilist.com/instance/gangstalking.services">gangstalking.services</a> (a <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/987672a2f1853b5c21fe8de9e0b8ee012d9e476e0d82c047d72b5fa17061eda5">signed-fetch workaround</a> and <a href="https://media.freespeechextremist.com/rvl/full/61c804fbb9e9d9f83128bde6ddecc7ed20cd404a14f596ff5fa181afbcbf8628">proof of concept</a>) as well as <a href="https://fedilist.com/instance/pls.zuck.dad">pls.zuck.dad</a> and other instances, a lot of normal fedi software can be repurposed for this kind of thing.
</p>
<p>So, if you're not a shady asshole and you're just trying to run a server, keep it in mind.  A company like SocialGist can make themselves hard to find:  I only knew about them because they screwed up, but once I knew where to look, it wasn't difficult to create a trail of breadcrumbs.  How many people or organizations are out there doing the same thing, but <em>without</em> SocialGist's mistakes?  How would you know?

Think of sleeper trains, boat trains, vintage steam railways, elegant dining cars. But it’s rare that an urban transport system can capture the imagination quite as much as the Wuppertal Schwebebahn in Germany caught mine, and that of anyone else who’s clapped eyes on the world’s oldest suspended railway.</p><figure id="disclaimer" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.DisclaimerBlockElement"><span></span></figure><p>In October it will be 125 years since Kaiser Wilhelm II took a test ride in the Schwebebahn, just a few months before the hanging railway officially opened for business in March 1901. It was an incredible feat of engineering then, and remains so today. Even with sleek modern carriages having long replaced the original ones, it looks like something imagined by Jules Verne, with carriages smoothly gliding under the overhead track. They have even preserved the first 1901 carriage, nicknamed Kaiserwagen, which can be hired for private occasions.</p><p>A childlike feeling of glee filled me as I sat in the rear of the long carriage and watched the city reveal itself as I floated anything from 8 to 9 metres (26ft to 39ft) above it. At the railway’s westernmost end, Vohwinkel is the first of only four stations whose carriages run above the street, between iron arches. The rest of the railway, which in total runs for just over eight miles, follows the route of the river Wupper. As the hanging train curves and sways above the serpentine river, it turns this commuter service into something like a fairground ride for its 80,000 daily passengers. My hitherto unknown train geek had been unleashed and was utterly delighted.</p><figure id="9d465518-f6d9-4be8-ad10-d49018d42b4d" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="The Schwebebahn railway follows the route of the River Wupper." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b99c72fd2cce4c7f0b42b0ddb9daa54afa906e/504_0_5040_4032/master/5040.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="356" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>The Schwebebahn railway follows the route of the River Wupper.</span> Photograph: Hackenberg-Photo-Cologne/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>The Schwebebahn came about almost by accident. The Wupper valley, about 15 miles east of Düsseldorf, was a major textile production base when Germany was undergoing its own Industrial Revolution in the 19th century. As workers flooded to the growing cities of Barmen and Elberfeld – which merged in 1929 and were renamed Wuppertal in 1930 – the authorities realised a public transport system was needed. Other cities were going underground, but Wuppertal’s rocky soil and narrow, steep valley made any sort of U-Bahn impossible, forcing the Schwebebahn’s inventor, Eugen Langen, to look up instead.</p><p>At Schwebodrom, the railway museum that opened in late 2023 near Werther Brücke station at the line’s eastern end, the rich history of the Schwebebahn is laid out in three galleries, revealing one fascinating detail after another. One gallery tells the story of Tuffi, a young circus elephant loaded into the Schwebebahn for a publicity stunt in 1950. Poor Tuffi was so spooked by jostling journalists that she bolted through a window and tumbled into the river. Luckily she was only lightly bruised and lived for another 49 years, her landing spot in the Wupper now marked by an elephant statue between Alter Markt and Adler Brücke stations. You can’t move in Wuppertal without seeing Tuffi on some souvenir or another – even on milk cartons.</p><p>Among the museum’s films and displays, the highlight for me was the reproduction of an original carriage, where I sat glued to my VR headset and found myself in 1920s Wuppertal. After riding the rails in real life, I was able to go back in time to see what had changed. Much of Wuppertal had to be rebuilt after heavy allied bombing in the second world war, and the railway itself has been completely reconstructed – including its art nouveau stations – while keeping the original steampunk-style design in the iron girders.</p><figure id="e88de0a8-dccb-4a0b-9b2a-f42d8e15dcd5" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28cb96401c238bc658480c6b450553209d1acb81/279_14_3579_2863/master/3579.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28cb96401c238bc658480c6b450553209d1acb81/279_14_3579_2863/master/3579.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28cb96401c238bc658480c6b450553209d1acb81/279_14_3579_2863/master/3579.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28cb96401c238bc658480c6b450553209d1acb81/279_14_3579_2863/master/3579.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28cb96401c238bc658480c6b450553209d1acb81/279_14_3579_2863/master/3579.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28cb96401c238bc658480c6b450553209d1acb81/279_14_3579_2863/master/3579.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Laurentiusplatz, Wuppertal." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28cb96401c238bc658480c6b450553209d1acb81/279_14_3579_2863/master/3579.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="355.9751327186365" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Laurentiusplatz, Wuppertal.</span> Photograph: ©Adam Batterbee</figcaption></figure><p>But there is a Wuppertal beyond the Schwebebahn, and this city of about 350,000 people was as full of pleasant surprises as its railway. Local guide Heike Fragemann took me to the tree-lined streets around Laurentiusplatz, a square dominated by the austere-looking 19th-century basilica of St Lawrence, dedicated to Wuppertal’s patron saint. Popular with many of the 23,000 students at the University of Wuppertal as well as people of all ages, the cosmopolitan streets hummed with cafes, delis, boutiques, bars and restaurants run by some of the many nationalities that have settled here over the decades – Italian, Turkish, Greek, Indian, Vietnamese and Spanish among them. In fact, the range of restaurants throughout the city was huge, and also included Lebanese, Chinese, Croatian and traditional German fare.</p><p>Pointing out an example of Wuppertal’s distinctive style of architecture – slate cladding, green shutters and white window frames – Heike led me along the narrow streets behind Laurentiusplatz as we steadily walked uphill. Not only was Wuppertal Germany’s Manchester because of its industry, Heike told me, but it was also compared to San Francisco thanks to its steepness. “We are the city of steps,” she said as we came to yet another one. “We have 500 staircases, more than 12,000 steps within the city. This is the most famous one.” She pointed to a sign with the captivating name of Tippen-Tappen-Tönchen, in honour of those 19th-century workmen clopping in their wooden clogs towards the riverside factories – hence the tipping-tapping sound. One to add to my list of adorable street names.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-13">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-13" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><figure id="584fe0b6-66ec-4fee-8c9c-f5e806a78cbd" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="The Elisenturm tower sits next to a lily-covered pond in the Botanical Garden in Wuppertal" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d737910ff88ae0c859a991a796354573160e2dd2/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="356" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>The Botanical Garden, one of many public gardens in Wuppertal, a city shaped by wealthy 19th-century industrialists.</span> Photograph: Zoonar GmbH/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>It was the wealthy 19th-century industrialists who shaped the city, not just with their comfortable hillside villas, but also with Wuppertal’s cultural institutions. The Von der Heydt Museum, named after an art-collecting banking family, houses its impressive collection of 19th- and early 20th-century art in what had been the neoclassical town hall. The entrance is flanked by two large sculptures by the Liverpool-born Turner prize-winner Tony Cragg, who made Wuppertal his home in 1977. The Historische Stadthalle concert hall, marking its 125th anniversary this year, had Richard Strauss as one of its first conductors and Sir Simon Rattle rated its acoustics among the best in the world.

Engels died in London six years before the Schwebebahn opened, and it was many years earlier that the city’s industrialists had already implemented social reforms for working-class residents that were ahead of their time. The Schwebebahn, too, looks like something from the future, but its story is purely of Wuppertal’s unique past.

        <p>The promise is seductive: Snap a photo of your meal, and artificial intelligence will instantly tell you exactly how many calories you're consuming. No more tedious manual logging, no more guessing at portion sizes, no more human error. Apps like Cal AI, Lose It!, and MyFitnessPal's new photo features claim to revolutionize calorie tracking by letting your smartphone's camera do the heavy lifting.</p><p>But as someone with a long, complicated history with calorie counting—and admittedly, a somewhat <a href="https://lifehacker.com/fuck-noom-1848442892" target="_blank">cursed expertise in it</a>—I can tell you that counting calories with a photo is exactly as stupid as it sounds.</p><h2 id="how-ai-powered-calorie-counting-is-supposed-to-work">How AI-powered calorie counting is supposed to work</h2><p>Calorie counting apps promise to solve what developers claim is the biggest problem with calorie tracking: human error.

Cal AI markets itself as one of the more sophisticated options in this space, so I decided to see for myself. The app was free for the first three days, then $29.99/year.</p><p>The setup process is straightforward: Download the app, create an account, input basic demographic information, and set your goals. Here's where I encountered my first red flag. The app cheerfully informed me that "losing 10 lbs is a realistic target"—except that losing 10 pounds would actually push me into underweight BMI territory. This kind of blanket statement reveals a concerning lack of nuance about individual health needs.</p><p>Cal AI's photo logging process follows these steps:</p><ol><li><p>Take a clear photo of your food, ideally against a plain background.</p></li><li><p>Make sure all ingredients are visible and well-lit.</p></li><li><p>Include a reference object (like a coin or your hand) for scale.</p></li><li><p>Upload the image and wait for AI analysis.</p></li><li><p>Review and correct the app's identifications and portion estimates.</p></li><li><p>Save the entry to your daily log.</p></li></ol><p>The app provides detailed tips for getting better results: Use natural lighting, avoid shadows, keep the camera parallel to the plate, and ensure no ingredients are hidden. These guidelines sound reasonable in theory, but they hint at the fundamental challenge these apps face—the complexity of real-world eating.</p><h2 id="the-reality-is-wildly-disappointing">The reality is wildly disappointing</h2><p>I started my testing with something simple: a Pink Lady apple weighing 222 grams. Surely this would be an easy win for the AI—apples are among the most photographed foods on earth, with a distinctive shape and color that should be instantly recognizable.</p><p>Cal AI confidently identified my apple as tikka masala.</p><div>

<p>I gave it another chance, this time photographing the apple alongside its barcode and sitting on a kitchen scale displaying its exact weight. The app did recognize it as an apple this time, but estimated it at 80 calories when the <a href="https://www.pinkladyapples.co.uk/the-pink-lady-story/apple-nutrition-vitamins-and-minerals" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">actual count</a> should have been closer to 120. That's a 33% underestimation—not exactly the precision you'd want if you're trying to track intake accurately.</p><p>The real test came with a more complex meal: my current meal-prepped lunch of fried tofu, onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, feta cheese, and chickpeas, all generously dressed with an oil-based homemade vinaigrette. This is the kind of mixed dish that presumably showcases AI's advantage over manual logging—no need to search for individual ingredients or estimate their quantities.</p><p>The results were a masterclass in algorithmic overconfidence. The app identified the golden-brown fried tofu as croutons, which I had to manually correct. It did a reasonably good job recognizing the vegetables and feta, but completely whiffed on the oil content. Despite the salad being visibly glistening with dressing, the app estimated the entire dish at 450 calories.</p><p>This estimate was laughably low. A single can of chickpeas contains <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Chickpeas_%28garbanzo_beans%2C_bengal_gram%29%2C_rinsed_in_tap_water%2C_drained%2C_canned%2C_mature_seeds_nutritional_value.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">about 400 calories</a>, and my portion included roughly that amount plus significant quantities of feta cheese and several tablespoons of olive-oil-based dressing. A realistic calorie count for this meal would have been closer to 800 to 900 calories.</p><p>The app's portion estimation proved even more problematic than its ingredient identification. When I photographed a smaller serving—less than a quarter of the original salad—Cal AI estimated it at 250 calories. According to the app's own logic, less than 25% of the meal somehow contained more than 55% of its calories. The math simply doesn't work.</p><div>

<p>This highlights a fundamental limitation of photo-based calorie counting: Cameras capture two-dimensional images of three-dimensional objects. Without consistent reference points or sophisticated depth analysis, estimating volume from photos remains largely guesswork. Even humans struggle with this task, which is why nutrition professionals typically recommend weighing foods for accuracy.</p><p>To get a fuller picture of the AI calorie counting landscape, I also tested two other popular apps: SnapCalorie and Calorie Mama.</p><h2 id="snapcalorie-better-numbers-same-problems">SnapCalorie: better numbers, same problems</h2><p><a href="https://www.snapcalorie.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">SnapCalorie</a> did immediately assuage some skepticism by suggesting a much more reasonable daily calorie target of 1,900 calories, compared to Cal AI's problematic weight loss messaging. However, this accuracy comes at a steep price—$79.99 per year after just a one-week free trial, making it the most expensive option I tested.</p><p>The app does offer one interesting feature: an "add note" function that lets you provide additional context about ingredients the camera can't see. In theory, this addresses one of the fundamental limitations of photo-based tracking.</p><div>

<p>When I tested SnapCalorie with the same Pink Lady apple, it performed much better than Cal AI, estimating 115 calories. But the Greek salad test revealed familiar problems. SnapCalorie's initial estimate was an absurdly low 257 calories. When I photographed a smaller portion—the same sub-quarter serving that had stumped Cal AI—SnapCalorie estimated 184 calories. The math still didn't work; this smaller portion should have been roughly 25% of the larger serving, not 70%.</p><p>Determined to give the app a fair shot, I used the note feature to manually specify "full container of tofu, feta, chickpeas and olive oil." With this human intervention, SnapCalorie bumped its estimate to 761 calories—much more reasonable and accurate, though still on the low side. </p><p>But this raises the obvious question: If I need to manually input detailed ingredient information to get accurate results, what exactly is the photo accomplishing? I'm essentially doing the work of traditional calorie counting while going through the motions of taking pictures.</p><div data-ga-click="" data-ga-template="Explainers" data-ga-module="openweb_widget" data-ga-element="openweb_scroll" data-ga-item="openweb_scroll_midpage" x-data="{

<h2 id="calorie-mama-when-ai-doesnt-even-try">Calorie Mama: when AI doesn't even try</h2><p>Calorie Mama provided the most frustrating and laughable experience of the three apps. The interface feels rudimentary, and the AI's performance is so poor that the app essentially abandons the premise of automated photo analysis.</p><p>After uploading a photo, Calorie Mama requires you to manually confirm not just the food items but also their portion sizes. This defeats the entire purpose of photo-based logging—you're doing all the work that manual entry would require anyway.</p><p>When I uploaded my Greek salad photo, Calorie Mama identified it simply as "tofu"—ignoring the vegetables, feta cheese, chickpeas, and dressing entirely. The app then asked me to manually adjust the portion size and seemed to consider the logging complete, as if a complex mixed dish contained nothing but plain tofu.</p><p>This wasn't just inaccurate; it was useless. At least Cal AI and SnapCalorie attempted to recognize multiple ingredients, even if their calorie estimates were off. Calorie Mama appeared to give up on the core challenge entirely, relegating the AI to little more than a gimmicky photo storage system.</p><h2 id="ai-powered-calorie-counting-wasted-my-time">AI-powered calorie counting wasted my time</h2><p>The promise of AI-powered calorie counting is efficiency—snap and go, no manual entry required. But my experience revealed a different reality. I spent considerable time correcting ingredient identifications, adjusting portion sizes, and second-guessing the app's estimates. In many cases, I would have been faster using traditional manual logging with a food scale and database search.</p><p>This creates a frustrating conundrum: If you don't scrutinize the AI's results, you'll get wildly inaccurate data. But if you do verify every entry, you lose the time-saving benefit that justified using the technology in the first place. It's the worst of both worlds—the effort of manual tracking combined with the uncertainty of automated guessing.</p><p>Perhaps most concerning is what happens when users don't have the background to recognize inaccurate estimates. My years of calorie counting experience—<a href="https://lifehacker.com/fuck-noom-1848442892" target="_blank">problematic as that history may be</a>—gave me the knowledge to spot when Cal AI's numbers were off. But what about users who trust the technology?</p><p>Systematic underestimation of calories could be particularly harmful for people trying to lose weight, as it might lead them to believe they're eating less than they actually are. Conversely, overestimation could cause unnecessary restriction or anxiety around food. Either way, inaccurate data undermines the entire purpose of tracking.</p><p>The fundamental issue with AI calorie counting apps isn't just technical—it's philosophical. These tools emerge from and reinforce the idea that precise calorie tracking is both necessary and beneficial for health. But <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28214452/#:~:text=Findings%20highlight%20associations%20between%20use,Fitness%20tracking%3B%20Health%20tracking%20technology." target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener">research suggests</a> that obsessive calorie counting may do more harm than good for many people.</p><p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/a-beginner-s-guide-to-intuitive-eating-1832765380" target="_blank">Intuitive eating</a>, which focuses on internal hunger and satiety cues rather than external metrics, has shown promise as a more sustainable and psychologically healthy approach to nutrition. This framework emphasizes developing a healthy relationship with food based on how it makes you feel rather than hitting specific numerical targets.</p><p>For most people, understanding general principles of balanced nutrition—eating plenty of vegetables, choosing whole grains over refined ones, including adequate protein—provides better long-term outcomes than meticulous calorie tracking. </p><h2 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h2><p>AI-powered calorie counting apps promise to solve human error in dietary tracking, but they introduce new forms of inaccuracy while maintaining many of the old problems. If your goal is simply to get a rough estimate of how many calories are in generic foods, these apps might provide some value. But for anyone seeking precision in their intake tracking, traditional methods combined with food scales remain more reliable.</p><p>More importantly, I'd question whether precise calorie counting serves your health goals at all. For many people, developing a more intuitive relationship with food—one based on satisfaction, energy levels, and overall well-being rather than numerical targets—leads to better physical and mental health. Maybe the old-fashioned approach of listening to our bodies works better than any algorithm. </p>

</a></h2>
        <p>Author: Andrew Kelley</p><p>Now, when you target x86_64, by default, Zig will use its own x86 backend rather than using LLVM to lower a bitcode file to an object file.</p><p>The default is not changed on Windows yet, because more COFF linker work needs to be done first.</p><p>The x86 backend is now passing 1987 behavior tests, versus 1980 passed by the LLVM backend. In reality there are 2084 behavior tests, but the extra ones there are generally redundant with LLVM’s own test suite for its own x86 backend, so we only run those when testing with self-hosted x86. Anyway, my point is that Zig’s x86 backend is now <em>more robust</em> than its LLVM backend in terms of implementing the Zig language.</p><p>Why compete with LLVM on code generation? There are <a href="https://ziggit.dev/t/can-someone-explain-why-zig-is-moving-away-from-llvm-but-in-simple-way/1226/6?u=andrewrk" target="_blank">a handful of reasons</a>, but mainly, because we can dramatically outperform LLVM at compilation speed.</p><pre><code>Benchmark 1 (6 runs): zig build-exe hello.zig -fllvm

</code></pre><p>For a larger project like the Zig compiler itself, it takes the time down from 75 seconds to 20 seconds.</p><p>We’re <em>only just getting started</em>. We’ve already started work <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/722533" target="_blank">fully parallelizing code generation</a>. We’re also just a few linker enhancements and bug fixes away from making incremental compilation stable and robust in combination with this backend. There is still low hanging fruit for improving the generated x86 code quality. And we’re looking at aarch64 next - work that is expected to be accelerated thanks to our new Legalize pass.</p><p>The CI has finished building the respective commit, so you can try this out yourself by fetching the latest master branch build from <a href="https://ziglang.org/download/">the download page</a>.</p><p>Finally, here’s a gentle reminder that Zig Software Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that funds its development with donations from generous people like you.

</a></h2>
        <p>Author: Alex Rønne Petersen</p><p>Pull requests <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/23835" target="_blank">#23835</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/23913" target="_blank">#23913</a> have now been merged. This means that, using <code>zig cc</code> or <code>zig build</code>, you can now build binaries targeting FreeBSD 14.0.0+ and NetBSD 10.1+ from any machine, just as you’ve been able to for Linux, macOS, and Windows for a long time now.</p><p>This builds on the <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/libc-abi-tools" target="_blank">strategy</a> we were already using for glibc and will soon be using for other targets as well. For any given FreeBSD/NetBSD release, we build libc and related libraries for every supported target, and then extract public symbol information from the resulting ELF files. We then combine all that information into a very compact <code>abilists</code> file that gets shipped with Zig. Finally, when the user asks to link libc while cross-compiling, we load the <code>abilists</code> file and build a stub library for each constituent libc library (<code>libc.so</code>, <code>libm.so</code>, etc), making sure that it accurately reflects the symbols provided by libc for the target architecture and OS version, and has the expected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soname" target="_blank">soname</a>. This is all quite similar to how the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-ifs.html" target="_blank">llvm-ifs tool</a> works.</p><p>We currently import <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crt0" target="_blank">crt0</a> code from the latest known FreeBSD/NetBSD release and manually apply any patches needed to make it work with any OS version that we support cross-compilation to. This is necessary because the OS sometimes changes the crt0 ABI. We’d like to eventually <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/23875" target="_blank">reimplement the crt0 code in Zig</a>.</p><p>We also ship FreeBSD/NetBSD system and libc headers with the Zig compiler. Unlike the stub libraries we produce, however, we always import headers from the latest version of the OS. This is because it would be far too space-inefficient to ship separate headers for every OS version, and we realistically don’t have the time to audit the headers on every import and add appropriate version guards to all new declarations. The good news, though, is that we do accept patches to add version guards when necessary; we’ve already had many contributions of this sort in our imported glibc headers.</p><p>Please take this for a spin and report any bugs you find!</p><p>We would like to also add support for <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2878" target="_blank">OpenBSD libc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/23880" target="_blank">Dragonfly BSD libc</a>, but because these BSDs cannot be conveniently cross-compiled from Linux, we need motivated users of them to chip in. Besides those, we are also looking into <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/23879" target="_blank">SerenityOS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/23906" target="_blank">Android</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/23877" target="_blank">Fuchsia</a> libc support.</p>

</a></h2>
        <p>Author: David Rubin</p><p>Lately, I’ve been extensively working with C interop, and one thing that’s been sorely missing is clear error messages from UBSan. When compiling C with <code>zig cc</code>, Zig provides better defaults, including implicitly enabling <code>-fsanitize=undefined</code>. This has been great for catching subtle bugs and makes working with C more bearable. However, due to the lack of a UBSan runtime, all undefined behavior was previously caught with a <code>trap</code> instruction.</p><p>For example, consider this example C program:</p><pre><code><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span>int</span> <span>foo</span>(<span>int</span> <span>x</span>, <span>int</span> <span>y</span>) {
    <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span><span>;</span>
}

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>foo</span>(<span>0x7fffffff</span>, <span>0x7fffffff</span>)<span>;</span>
    <span>printf</span>(<span>"%d\n"</span>, <span>result</span>)<span>;</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Running this with <code>zig cc</code> used to result in an unhelpful error:</p><pre><code>$ zig run test.c -lc
fish: Job 1, 'zig run empty.c -lc' terminated by signal SIGILL (Illegal instruction)
</code></pre><p>Not exactly informative! To understand what went wrong, you’d have to run the executable in a debugger. Even then, tracking down the root cause could be daunting. Many newcomers ran into this <code>Illegal instruction</code> error without realizing that UBSan was enabled by default, leading to confusion. This issue was common enough to warrant a dedicated <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/zig-cc-compatibility-with-clang#ubsan-and-sigill-illegal-instruction" target="_blank">Wiki page</a>.</p><p>With the new <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/22488" target="_blank">UBSan runtime merged</a>, the experience has completely changed. Now instead of an obscure <code>SIGILL</code>, you get a much more helpful error message:</p><pre><code>$ zig run test.c -lc
thread 208135 panic: signed integer overflow: 2147483647 + 2147483647 cannot be represented in type 'int'

</code></pre><p>Now, not only do we see <em>what</em> went wrong (signed integer overflow), but we also see <em>where</em> it happened – two critical pieces of information that were previously missing.</p><h2>Remaining Limitations</h2><p>While the new runtime vastly improves debugging, there are still two features that LLVM’s UBSan runtime provides which ours doesn’t support yet:</p><ol><li>In C++, UBSan can detect when an object’s vptr indicates the wrong dynamic type or when its lifetime hasn’t started. Supporting this would require replicating the Itanium C++ ABI, which isn’t worth the extreme complexity.</li><li>Currently, the runtime doesn’t show the exact locations of attributes like <code>assume_aligned</code> and <code>__nonnull</code>. This should be relatively straightforward to add, and contributions are welcome!</li></ol><p>If you’ve ever been frustrated by cryptic <code>SIGILL</code> errors while trying out Zig, this update should make debugging undefined behavior a lot easier!</p>

</a></h2>
        <p>Author: Andrew Kelley</p><p>Alright, I know I’m supposed to be focused on issue triage and merging PRs for the upcoming release this month, but in my defense, I do some of my best work while procrastinating.</p><p>Jokes aside, this week we had CI failures due to Zig’s debug allocator creating too many memory mappings. This was interfering with Jacob’s work on the x86 backend, so I spent the time to <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/20511#issuecomment-2638356298" target="_blank">rework the debug allocator</a>.</p><p>Since this was a chance to eliminate the dependency on a compile-time known page size, I based my work on contributor archbirdplus’s patch to add runtime-known page size support to the Zig standard library. With this change landed, it means Zig finally works on Asahi Linux. My fault for originally making page size compile-time known. Sorry about that!</p><p>Along with detecting page size at runtime, the new implementation no longer memsets each page to 0xaa bytes then back to 0x00 bytes, no longer searches when freeing, and no longer depends on a treap data structure. Instead, the allocation metadata is stored inline, on the page, using a pre-cached lookup table that is computed at compile-time:</p><pre><code><span>/// This is executed only at compile-time to prepopulate a lookup table.</span>

<p>It’s pretty nice because you can tweak some global constants and then get optimal slot sizes. That assert at the end means if the constraints could not be satisfied you get a compile error. Meanwhile in C land, equivalent code has to resort to handcrafted lookup tables. Just look at the top of malloc.c from musl:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>uint16_t</span> <span>size_classes</span>[] <span>=</span> {
	<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>,
	<span>9</span>, <span>10</span>, <span>12</span>, <span>15</span>,
	<span>18</span>, <span>20</span>, <span>25</span>, <span>31</span>,

<p>Not nearly as nice to experiment with different size classes. The water’s warm, Rich, come on in! 😛</p><p>Anyway, as a result of reworking this allocator, not only does it work with runtime-known page size, and avoid creating too many memory mappings, it also performs significantly better than before. The motivating test case for these changes was this degenerate ast-check task, with a debug compiler:</p><pre><code>Benchmark 1 (3 runs): master/bin/zig ast-check ../lib/compiler_rt/udivmodti4_test.zig

</code></pre><p>I didn’t stop there, however. Even though I had release tasks to get back to, this left me <em>itching</em> to make a fast allocator - one that was designed for multi-threaded applications built in ReleaseFast mode.</p><p>It’s a tricky problem. A fast allocator needs to avoid contention by storing thread-local state, however, it does not directly learn when a thread exits, so one thread must periodically attempt to reclaim another thread’s resources. There is also the producer-consumer pattern - one thread only allocates while one thread only frees. A naive implementation would never reclaim this memory.</p><p>Inspiration struck, and <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/42dbd35d3e16247ee68d7e3ace0da3778a1f5d37/lib/std/heap/SmpAllocator.zig" target="_blank">200 lines of code later</a> I had a working implementation… after Jacob helped me find a couple logic bugs.</p><p>I created <a href="https://github.com/andrewrk/CarmensPlayground" target="_blank">Where in the World Did Carmen’s Memory Go?</a> and used it to test a couple specific usage patterns. Idea here is to over time collect a robust test suite, do fuzzing, benchmarking, etc., to make it easier to try out new Allocator ideas in Zig.</p><p>After getting good scores on those contrived tests, I turned to the real world use cases of the Zig compiler itself. Since it can be built with and without libc, it’s a great way to test the performance delta between the two.</p><p>Here’s that same degenerate case above, but with a release build of the compiler - glibc zig vs no libc zig:</p><pre><code>Benchmark 1 (32 runs): glibc/bin/zig ast-check ../lib/compiler_rt/udivmodti4_test.zig

Or at the very least, if they did want to try to sell it this way, surely they would announce </span><em>one</em><span> deal with an actual democracy first.</span></p><p>Apparently not.</p><p>The week after returning from the Gulf, OpenAI announced a major new partnership to build large-scale AI data centers in the UAE. The partnership, they write, is “rooted in democratic values.”</p><p>Let’s take a quick look at the UAE’s democratic bona fides.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://freedomhouse.org/" rel="">Freedom House</a><span> is an independent nonprofit that has released an annual assessment of countries’ civil liberties and political rights for the last 50 years.

One human rights organization </span><a href="https://www.walkfree.org/global-slavery-index/country-studies/united-arab-emirates/" rel="">claims</a><span> that the UAE has the 7th highest prevalence of modern slavery in the world.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>This is not controversial.

Obviously OpenAI wants as much compute as it can get, and partnering with the UAE gets them money, energy, and permitting they couldn’t get elsewhere. Maybe we’re supposed to see through the spin and go on with our day.</p><p><span>But they’re really trying quite hard to sell this as promoting democracy. Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s head of global affairs, attempted to make the case in </span><a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/5319030-the-false-choice-threatening-americas-lead-on-ai/" rel="">The Hill</a><span> last week. Some excerpts:</span></p><blockquote><p>Ensuring that democratic values shape the future of AI is the most urgent challenge of our time, and we need to seize this moment and think big, act big and build big — both here and abroad — to ensure that it prevails over authoritarian AI in the competition over the technology’s future.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Many countries are navigating complex choices as they evaluate what kind of AI systems — and what kinds of values — they wish to adopt. Supporting these nations is not just about competition. It is about offering a meaningful alternative: a version of AI development that upholds individual rights, resists central control and aligns with the long-standing principles of transparency and fairness embedded in the international system.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If the U.S. doesn’t engage with countries looking to build AI, autocrats will step in to fill that void — and core freedoms may fall by the wayside.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>As part of this effort, the UAE — a close American ally and leader in the global push to develop renewable, economically viable sources of energy — will become the first country in the world to enable ChatGPT nationwide, giving people across the country the ability to access OpenAI’s technology.</p></blockquote><p>If I try to be charitable, I can glean two lines of argument in Lehane’s piece and other OpenAI comments on the deal:</p><ol><li><p>American AI embodies democratic values, so giving it to more people spreads democracy.</p></li><li><p>The US is a democracy and China isn’t, so anything that helps the US “win” the AI “race” is good for democracy.</p></li></ol><p>I don’t think these two arguments are a good summary of the situation.</p><p><strong>Argument 1</strong><span> is probably true-ish in extreme cases, but not particularly relevant here.</span></p><p><span>AI systems can certainly embody more or less democratic values, depending on their training data, what behavior they were </span><a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/how-developers-steer-language-model-outputs-large-language-models-explained-part-2/" rel="">fine-tuned</a><span> towards, and what kinds of </span><a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/controlling-large-language-models-a-primer/" rel="">filters and censors</a><span> are built around them. Hypothetically, if a country went from prohibiting access to uncensored AI chatbots to allowing it, that could be a win for democratic values, freedom of information, etc. Or hypothetically, if a company provided access to pro-democracy AI tools against the wishes of a non-democratic government, that could be valuable; the benefits would likely be modest if residents still weren’t allowed to criticize their government, be elected to actual governing bodies, or be tried in a fair court, but perhaps it could help shift the country in a democratic direction over the long term.</span></p><p><span>But there’s nothing to indicate this deal is trying to realize either of those hypotheticals. I honestly don’t know how to parse OpenAI’s boast that “the UAE will become the first country in the world to enable ChatGPT nationwide.” Was ChatGPT previously restricted in the UAE? Do the US, Australia, Canada, etc. not have ChatGPT “enabled” nationwide? What does this even mean?</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-164818379" href="https://helentoner.substack.com/p/supercomputers-for-autocrats#footnote-1-164818379" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><p><span>And there’s no sign that OpenAI plans to stick their neck out to make ChatGPT more democratic than other AI tools UAE residents have access to (which, as far as I know, include other US offerings like Gemini, Claude, and Llama). If anything, it might be the opposite. COO Brad Lightcap was asked recently whether it was safe to assume that ChatGPT in the UAE would uphold the “red lines” that prevent media from criticizing the royal family and other sensitive topics. His answer: “Well, we don’t know. We’ve got to work on this together in partnership with the country.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-164818379" href="https://helentoner.substack.com/p/supercomputers-for-autocrats#footnote-2-164818379" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p>What a farce.</p><p><strong>Argument 2</strong><span>, about “winning” the “race,” could be more compelling. In theory, I get it. Compute is a big driver of AI success, but it’s hard to build big data centers in the US right now. If other countries can provide funding, energy, and permitting, then US companies get more compute, build better AI, and beat China. Great.</span></p><p>But thinking solely about the US and China misses one of the biggest implications of this deal. Let’s look at some more excerpts from the Lehane piece:</p><blockquote><p>Countries that build the most AI infrastructure today will reap the greatest rewards in the coming Intelligence Age.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Only the U.S. and China have the resources and capacity to shape the future trajectory of AI and determine whether it advances in ways that protect freedom, dignity and human agency or whether it becomes a tool of surveillance and repression.</p></blockquote><p>And let’s also return to the quote from the top of this post:</p><blockquote><p>It’s clear to everyone now that this kind of infrastructure is going to be the backbone of future economic growth and national development.</p></blockquote><p><span>These quotes get at what I think is actually the most important force here: </span><strong>large-scale compute is becoming an important driver of national power</strong><span>. In particular, access to world-class </span><a href="https://epoch.ai/data/ai-supercomputers" rel="">AI supercomputers</a><span> (comprising hundreds of thousands of the most advanced AI accelerators) is becoming an important driver of national power. Because of this, I agree that it is a very good thing for the US to have more AI compute, including more AI supercomputers, than China.</span></p><p>But if you take this argument seriously at all, the implication of the UAE deal becomes plain: this is a significant power boost for the UAE’s autocratic government. Public materials about the deals are very vague about who has what kind of ownership and usage rights of the compute, but it’s obvious that the UAE would not want to spend this amount of money if they weren’t getting significant access to—or ownership of—the chips in question.</p><p><span>The above excerpts from Lehane’s piece make it clear that the company knows very well that this deal empowers the UAE to be a big player in AI. Which means that when I read this from Lehane: “Only the U.S. and China have the resources and capacity to shape the future trajectory of AI…” I’m tempted to finish the sentence for him: “...and so it’s clear that the most democratic thing for us to do is equip a third country—an </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/uae-intelligence-chief-ai-money/" rel="">AI-obsessed</a><span>, wealthy, energy-rich autocracy—with the main ingredient it was lacking to become a global AI heavyweight: </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-13/us-weighs-letting-uae-buy-over-a-million-advanced-nvidia-chips" rel="">hundreds of thousands</a><span> of leading-edge AI chips.”</span></p><p><span>Making semiconductor deals with Gulf countries is not inherently a bad thing. Most of the details of OpenAI’s UAE deal and the flurry of similar deals announced a few weeks ago are not public (and in many cases </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-uae-multi-billion-dollar-ai-data-campus-deal-far-finalised-sources-say-2025-06-06/" rel="">not yet finalized</a><span>). The United States has a long history of partnering with Gulf autocrats for national security reasons, and there are </span><a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/emissary/2025/05/ai-chip-trump-gulf-uae-saudi-security-risk-good-deal" rel="">versions of these deals</a><span> that could have more benefits than costs from a hard-nosed realpolitik perspective. The details of the chip quantities involved, ownership/usage rights, and protections against technology transfer to China are all major factors in whether it will look in retrospect like the US made smart deals or got played.</span></p><p>But even the very best version of a Stargate UAE deal would, by definition, be under terms that are agreeable to the UAE royal family. This should be a clue that this partnership is not destined to be a powerful force for democracy.</p><p><span>If OpenAI were a regular for-profit company, maybe their spin around this deal wouldn’t matter so much. If AI were a less consequential technology, it certainly wouldn’t matter so much. But OpenAI is, as they keep reminding us, a </span><a href="https://openai.com/index/evolving-our-structure/" rel="">mission-driven nonprofit</a><span> aiming to build </span><a href="https://openai.com/index/planning-for-agi-and-beyond/" rel="">incredibly powerful technology</a><span>. Their mission, “to ensure AI benefits all of humanity,” sometimes gets paraphrased as building safe AGI. But that’s a huge simplification—figuring out what it could look like to develop incredibly powerful, world-transforming technology in a way that actually benefits everyone is far more complicated than just “make it safe” and “build it in the US.”</span></p><p>The question of who has access to and control over powerful AI systems is absolutely central to who will benefit from them. Building increasingly advanced AI in a way that doesn't widen existing power gaps, entrench autocracies, and disempower regular people is a civilizational-scale open question. Trying to pitch Stargate UAE as a democratic project gives us a window into how unseriously OpenAI is treating these challenges.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>If you just want the answer to the question posed in the title, click the TLDR below and then move on with your day. Otherwise, buckle in, we’re going debugging; this post is mostly about my thought process and techniques I used to arrive at the answer rather than the answer itself.</p><details><summary><b>TLDR:</b> Just tell me why CDC Ethernet doesn't work on Android</summary><br>Android's EthernetTracker service only acknowledges interfaces that are named <tt>ethX</tt>; Linux's CDC Ethernet drivers create interfaces that are named <tt>usbX</tt>. There is no way to work around this, short of rooting the phone to change the value of <tt>config_ethernet_iface_regex</tt>.</details><p>Android contains support for USB ethernet adapters. There’s even menus for them!</p><p><img src="https://jordemort.dev/images/android-cdc/connection-settings.jpg" alt="Android connection settings, with 'Ethernet' greyed out" title="Android connection settings, with 'Ethernet' greyed out"></p><p>This means that if you very carefully select a USB Ethernet adapter that you know has a chipset compatible with your Android device, you can plug it in and these settings will spring to life. How do you know what chipsets are compatible with your phone?</p><p>Hearsay!</p><p>I’m not entirely kidding. If the company that you bought your phone from sells a USB ethernet adapter as an accessory to it, you have a pretty good chance of that one working. Otherwise, it’s hit-or-miss; phone manufacturers rarely, if ever, publish lists of supported Ethernet adapters. The best you’re going to get is finding a forum post from someone that has the same phone as you saying that they bought a particular adapter that worked, and hoping you can find the same thing to buy.</p><p>Or is it?</p><p><img src="https://jordemort.dev/images/android-cdc/i-know-this.jpg" alt="This is a Linux system... I know this" title="This is a Linux system... I know this"></p><p>As you may know, if you dig deep beneath Android’s Googly carapace, you’ll find a Linux kernel. To build the Linux kernel, you must first configure it. This configuration determines what features and hardware the resulting kernel will support. Thus, the list of Ethernet adapters supported by your phone will more-or-less correspond to those selected in the kernel configuration for your phone, although it’s possible (but unlikely) that your phone’s manufacturer doesn’t ship all of the drivers that they build, or that they build additional third-party drivers separately.</p><p>So, in order to figure out what Ethernet adapters your phone supports, you’re going to want to find your phone’s kernel configuration. How do we do that?</p><h3 id="first-enable-usb-debugging-and-install-adb">First, enable USB debugging and install ADB</h3><p>If you’d like to follow along with this blog post, you’re going to need enable USB debugging and to install ADB (Android Debug Bridge) — this is a command-line tool that is used by developers to interact with Android devices. In this post, we will be using it to run shell commands on a phone.</p><p>There’s good documentation elsewhere on how to do these things so I’m not going to waste time by rewriting it poorly. Instead, have some links:</p><ol><li>First, <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#Enable-debugging">enable USB debugging</a> on your phone</li><li><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/">Install ADB</a> on your computer</li><li>Run <code>adb shell</code>, which will give you a shell prompt on the phone.</li></ol><p><img src="https://jordemort.dev/images/android-cdc/im-in.jpg" alt="I'm in" title="I'm in"></p><p>Congratulations, you can now run commands on your phone. Type <code>exit</code> and press enter when you’re ready to exit the ADB shell.</p><p>Next, we need to switch things up so that ADB connects to the phone over the network, instead of via USB. We need to do this because we’re going to try plugging some network adapters into the phone’s USB port, so we can’t also use the port for debugging.</p><p>With your phone connected to your computer via USB:</p><ol><li>Connect your phone to the same network as your computer via wifi</li><li>Figure out your phone’s IP address - you can do this by digging around the Settings app, or you can try <code>adb shell ifconfig wlan0</code></li><li>With the phone still connected via USB, run <code>adb tcpip 5555</code></li><li>Disconnect the USB cable from the phone</li><li>Reconnect to the phone by running <code>adb connect YOUR_PHONE_IP:5555</code> (replacing YOUR_PHONE_IP with the IP address from the phone)</li><li>Try <code>adb shell</code> to make sure it still works</li></ol><p>Once you have ADB working over the network, you can proceed with trying to figure out what version of the kernel your Android device is running.</p><h3 id="if-you-have-a-newer-phone">If you have a newer phone…</h3><p>These days, Google publishes an <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/kernel/android-common">Android Common Kernel</a>, which downstream phone manufacturers are required to derive their kernels from. The source to this kernel is hosted in a <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/">Git repository at googlesource.com</a>.</p><p>If your phone shipped with Android 11 or later, you have something called a <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/kernel/generic-kernel-image">GKI kernel</a> - in this case, Google builds the kernel and the phone manufacturer puts all of their model-specific secret sauce into kernel modules. In this case, you can find the configuration that Google is using by navigating to the appropriate branch of the kernel repository, and looking at the file <code>arch/$ARCH/configs/gki_defconfig</code>, where <code>$ARCH</code> is the processor architecture of your phone. For example, if your phone has a 64-bit ARM processor (and it almost certainly does) then you will find this configuration at <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/refs/heads/android-mainline/arch/arm64/configs/gki_defconfig"><code>arch/arm64/configs/gki_defconfig</code></a>.</p><h3 id="how-do-i-find-out-for-sure-what-kernel-version-and-processor-architecture-my-phone-has">How do I find out for sure what kernel version and processor architecture my phone has?</h3><p>Now that we have the ability to run shell commands on the phone, we can turn to good old <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/uname.2.html"><code>uname</code></a> to discover the kernel version and architecture that’s currently running.</p><ol><li>Go back and <a href="#first-enable-usb-debugging-and-install-adb">enable USB debugging and install ADB</a>, if you haven’t arleady</li><li>Run <code>uname -a</code> on the phone, either by running <code>adb shell</code> and then running <code>uname -a</code>, or all in one go by running <code>adb shell uname -a</code>.</li></ol><p>You should get output something like this:</p><pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>Linux localhost 4.19.113-26203352 #1 SMP PREEMPT Tue Apr 18 16:05:51 KST 2023 aarch64 Toybox</span></span></code></pre><p>You’ll the kernel version in the third field and the architecture in the second-to-last; you’ll have to make an educated guess about which branch or tag in Google’s kernel repository corresponds to the one running on your phone.</p><h3 id="what-if-i-have-an-older-phone">What if I have an older phone?</h3><p>If you have an older phone, then you’re in the same boat as me; I have an iPhone as a daily driver, but I keep a Samsung Galaxy s20 around as an Android testbed. Unfortunately, the s20 shipped with Android 10, which is the version just before all of this standardized kernel stuff from Google became required. Even though the s20 has since been upgraded to Android 13, Google doesn’t require phone manufacturers to update the kernel along with the Android version, and so Samsung didn’t; it still runs a kernel based on Linux 4.19.</p><p>In this case, you need to get the kernel configuration from your phone manufacturer, so you’d better hope they’re actually doing regular source releases. Samsung does do this; you can find sources for their phones at <a href="https://opensource.samsung.com/uploadList?menuItem=mobile&amp;classification1=mobile_phone">opensource.samsung.com</a>.</p><p>Once you have the sources for your device, you’re going to have to dig around a bit to figure out what kernel config. The sources I obtained for my phone from Samsung included a <code>Kernel.tar.gz</code>; inside of this archive was a Linux kernel source tree, along with a few additions. One of those additions was a shell script called <code>build_kernel.sh</code>, which goes a little something like this:</p><pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>#!/bin/bash</span></span>

<span><span>... and so on ...</span></span></code></pre><p>Look for a <code>CONFIG_USB_NET_something</code> that looks like it relates to the chipset of the adapter you want to use. The best news is if it is set to <code>y</code>; that means the driver is built-in to your kernel and that your phone’s kernel definitely supports that chipset. If it’s set to <code>m</code>, that’s still <em>probably</em> good news; that means that the driver was compiled as a module when your kernel was built, and that the module is likely loadable on your phone unless your phone’s manufacturer specifically left it out. If you see <code>is not set</code>, then that is the worst news; the driver was neither built-in to your kernel, nor was it compiled as a module, so it’s likely not available for you to use.</p><p>If you’re having trouble figuring out which configuration items correspond to which chipsets, have a look at <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/refs/heads/android-mainline/drivers/net/usb/Kconfig"><code>drivers/net/usb/Kconfig</code></a> in your kernel tree. This file will contain extended descriptions of each configuration item.</p><p>Unfortunately, to figure out which chipset a particular adapter uses, you’re mostly back to hearsay; few manufacturers of USB Ethernet adapters explicitly advertise which chipset they use.</p><h3 id="so-whats-this-about-cdc-ethernet-and-why-should-i-care">So what’s this about CDC Ethernet and why should I care?</h3><p>CDC stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_communications_device_class">Communications Device Class</a>. This is a set of interrelated standards that manufacturers of USB devices can follow; among them are a trio of standards called EEM (Ethernet Emulation Model), ECM (Ethernet Control Model), and NCM (Network Control Model) that can be used to build USB Ethernet adapters. Most of the difference between these three standards is a matter of complexity; EEM is the simplest to implement and is easy to support on underpowered devices, but may not result in the best performance. ECM is more complex to implement for both the USB host and the device, but promises better performance than EEM; NCM is a successor to ECM that promises even higher speeds. Many devices implement more than one of these protocols, and leave it up to the host operating system to communicate with the device using the one that it prefers.</p><p>The point of these standards is that, assuming manufacturers follow them, operating systems can provide a single common driver that works with a variety of drivers. You generally don’t need special drivers for USB keyboards or mice because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_human_interface_device_class">USB HID</a> standard; the USB CDC standard attempts to accomplish the same for USB networking devices.</p><p>One particularly fun thing is that Linux implements both the host and the device side of the CDC Ethernet standards. That means that if you have hardware with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go">USB OTG</a> port, which is common on the Raspberry Pi and other small ARM devices, you can tell the kernel to use that port to <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/turning-your-raspberry-pi-zero-into-a-usb-gadget/ethernet-gadget">pretend to be an Ethernet adapter</a>. This creates a USB network interface on the host that is directly connected to an interface on the guest; this lets you build cool things like embedded routers, firewalls, and VPN gateways that look like just another Ethernet adapter to the host.</p><p>Linux, as well as Windows and macOS (but not iOS) include drivers for CDC Ethernet devices. Unfortunately, none of this works on Android devices, despite Android being based on Linux. Why is Android like this?</p><h3 id="based-on-the-kernel-configuration-android-appears-to-support-cdc">Based on the kernel configuration, Android <em>appears</em> to support CDC</h3><p>Let’s have another look at our kernel config, and grep for USB_NET_CDC:</p><pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>$ grep USB_NET_CDC my_kernel_config</span></span>

What do I know about how Android configures network interfaces?</p><p><strong>NOTHING.</strong> I know nothing about how Android configures network interfaces. How do we figure this out?</p><p>Well, Android is at least sort of open source; many of the good bits are closed behind the veil of something called “Google Play Services” but maybe there’s enough in the sources that are released to figure this out.</p><p>To play along with this bit, you’ll need to <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/setup/download/downloading">download the source to Android</a>. This is a whole process on its own, so I’ll leave you to Google’s documentation for this, except to note that you’ll need a special tool called <code>repo</code>. This seems to be meant to make it easier to download sources from multiple Git repositories at once; sometimes it feels like I’m the only person that actually likes <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">Git submodules</a>. There are a lot of sources to download, so start this process and then go knock off a few shrines in Zelda while it wraps up.</p><p>I figure that searching for the string <code>Ethernet</code> is probably a good starting point. Because there is so much source to go through, I’m going to skip vanilla <code>grep</code> this time and enlist the aid of <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>. There’s a lot of configuration files and other clutter in the Android sources, as well as most of a Linux distro, but I know that any code that we’re going to care about here is likely written in Java, so I’m going to restrict <code>rg</code> to searching in Java files:</p><pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>$ rg -t java Ethernet</span></span>

This appears to be a service that listens on a <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/netlink/intro.html">Netlink</a> socket and receives notifications from the kernel about new network interfaces. The EthernetTracker contains a method that determines if an Ethernet interface is “valid”; if it is valid, the EthernetTracker reports to the rest of the system that an interface is available, and the Settings app allows the interface to be configured. If an interface is not valid, then the EthernetTracker simply ignores it.</p><p>How does the EthernetTracker determine if an interface is valid?</p><pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>private</span><span> </span><span>boolean</span><span> </span><span>isValidEthernetInterface</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span> iface) {</span></span>

This puts you in a rather perverse situation when shopping for USB Ethernet adapters to use with Android; instead of looking for devices that implement the CDC standards, you need to explicitly <em>AVOID</em> the standards-based devices and look for something that is supported with a vendor/chipset-specific driver.</p><h3 id="thanks-for-playing">Thanks for playing!</h3><p>I hope you enjoyed going on this journey with me, or even better that I saved you from duplicating my efforts. Perhaps if I am feeling feisty, I will try to figure out how to submit a patch to Android to change that regex to <code>(eth|usb)\d</code> in the next few weeks. If a real Android dev or someone at Google reads this and beats me to the punch, I owe you the beverage of your choice.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>In a previous life, I worked for a location-based entertainment company, part
of a huge team of people developing a location for Las Vegas, Nevada. It was
COVID, a rough time for location-based anything, and things were delayed more
than usual. Coworkers paid a lot of attention to another upcoming Las Vegas
attraction, one with a vastly larger budget but still struggling to make
schedule: the MSG (Madison Square Garden) Sphere.</p>
<p>I will set aside jokes about it being a square sphere, but they were perhaps
one of the reasons that it underwent a pre-launch rebranding to merely the
Sphere. If you are not familiar, the Sphere is a theater and venue in Las
Vegas. While it's know mostly for the video display on the <em>outside,</em> that's
just marketing for the <em>inside</em>: a digital dome theater, with seating at a
roughly 45 degree stadium layout facing a near hemisphere of video displays.</p>
<p>It is a "near" hemisphere because the lower section is truncated to allow a
flat floor, which serves as a stage for events but is also a practical
architectural decision to avoid completely unsalable front rows. It might seem
a little bit deceptive that an attraction called the Sphere does not quite pull
off even a hemisphere of "payload," but the same compromise has been reached by
most dome theaters. While the use of digital display technology is flashy,
especially on the exterior, the Sphere is not quite the innovation that it
presents itself as. It is just a continuation of a long tradition of dome
theaters. Only time will tell, but the financial difficulties of the Sphere
suggest that follows the tradition faithfully: towards commercial failure.</p>
<p>You could make an argument that the dome theater is hundreds of years old, but
I will omit it. Things really started developing, at least in our modern
tradition of domes, with the 1923 introduction of the Zeiss planetarium
projector. Zeiss projectors and their siblings used a complex optical and
mechanical design to project accurate representations of the night sky. Many
auxiliary projectors, incorporated into the chassis and giving these projectors
famously eccentric shapes, rendered planets and other celestial bodies. Rather
than digital light modulators, the images from these projectors were formed by
purely optical means: perforated metal plates, glass plates with etched
metalized layers, and fiber optics. The large, precisely manufactured image
elements and specialized optics created breathtaking images.</p>
<p>While these projectors had considerable entertainment value, especially in the
mid-century when they represented some of the most sophisticated projection
technology yet developed, their greatest potential was obviously in education.
Planetarium projectors were fantastically expensive (being hand-built in
Germany with incredible component counts) [1], they were widely installed in
science museums around the world. Most of us probably remember a dogbone-shaped
Zeiss, or one of their later competitors like Spitz or Minolta, from our
youths. Unfortunately, these marvels of artistic engineering were mostly
retired as digital projection of near comparable quality became similarly
priced in the 2000s.</p>
<p>But we aren't talking about projectors, we're talking about theaters.
Planetarium projectors were highly specialized to rendering the night sky, and
everything about them was intrinsically spherical. For both a reasonable
viewing experience, and for the projector to produce a geometrically correct
image, the screen had to be a spherical section. Thus the planetarium itself:
in its most traditional form, rings of heavily reclined seats below a
hemispherical dome. The dome was rarely a full hemisphere, but was usually
truncated at the horizon. This was mostly a practical decision but integrated
well into the planetarium experience, given that sky viewing is usually poor
near the horizon anyway. Many planetaria painted a city skyline or forest
silhouette around the lower edge to make the transition from screen to wall
more natural. Later, theatrical lighting often replaced the silhouette,
reproducing twilight or the haze of city lights.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the application-specific design of these theaters also limits
their potential. Despite many attempts, the collective science museum industry
has struggled to find entertainment programming for planetaria much beyond Pink
Floyd laser shows [2]. There just aren't that many things that you look <em>up</em>
at. Over time, planetarium shows moved in more narrative directions.  Film
projection promised new flexibility---many planetaria with optical star
projectors were also equipped with film projectors, which gave show producers
exciting new options. Documentary video of space launches and animations of
physical principles became natural parts of most science museum programs, but
were a bit awkward on the traditional dome. You might project four copies of
the image just above the horizon in the four cardinal directions, for example.
It was very much a compromise.</p>
<p>With time, the theater adapted to the projection once again: the domes began to
tilt. By shifting the dome in one direction, and orienting the seating towards
that direction, you could create a sort of compromise point between the
traditional dome and traditional movie theater. The lower central area of the
screen was a reasonable place to show conventional film, while the full size of
the dome allowed the starfield to almost fill the audience's vision. The
experience of the tilted dome is compared to "floating in space," as opposed to
looking up at the sky.</p>
<p>In true Cold War fashion, it was a pair of weapons engineers (one nuclear
weapons, the other missiles) who designed the first tilted planetarium. In
1973, the planetarium of what is now called the Fleet Science Center in San
Diego, California opened to the public. Its dome was tilted 25 degrees to the
horizon, with the seating installed on a similar plane and facing in one
direction. It featured a novel type of planetarium projector developed by Spitz
and called the Space Transit Simulator. The STS was not the first, but still an
early mechanical projector to be controlled by a computer---a computer that
also had simultaneous control of other projectors and lighting in the theater,
what we now call a show control system.</p>
<p>Even better, the STS's innovative optical design allowed it to warp or bend the
starfield to simulate its appearance from locations other than earth. This was
the "transit" feature: with a joystick connected to the control computer, the
planetarium presenter could "fly" the theater through space in real time. The
STS was installed in a well in the center of the seating area, and its compact
chassis kept it low in the seating area, preserving the spherical geometry (with
the projector at the center of the sphere) without blocking the view of audience
members sitting behind it and facing forward.</p>
<p>And yet my main reason for discussing the Fleet planetarium is not the the
planetarium projector at all. It is a second projector, an "auxiliary" one,
installed in a second well behind the STS. The designers of the planetarium
intended to show film as part of their presentations, but they were not content
with a small image at the center viewpoint. The planetarium commissioned a few
of the industry's leading film projection experts to design a film projection
system that could fill the entire dome, just as the planetarium projector did.</p>
<p>They knew that such a large dome would require an exceptionally sharp image.
Planetarium projectors, with their large lithographed slides, offered excellent
spatial resolution. They made stars appear as point sources, the same as in the
night sky. 35mm film, spread across such a large screen, would be obviously
blurred in comparison. They would need a very large film format.</p>
<p><img alt="Omnimax dome with work lights on at Chicago Museum of Science and Industry" src="https://computer.rip/f/omnimax/b.jpg"></p>
<p>Fortuitously, almost simultaneously the Multiscreen Corporation was developing
a "sideways" 70mm format. This 15-perf format used 70mm film but fed it through
the projector sideways, making each frame much larger than typical 70mm film.
In its debut, at a temporary installation in the 1970 Expo Osaka, it was dubbed
IMAX. IMAX made an obvious basis for a high-resolution projection system, and
so the then-named IMAX Corporation was added to the planetarium project. The
Fleet's film projector ultimately consisted of an IMAX film transport with a
custom-built compact, liquid-cooled lamphouse and spherical fisheye lens
system.</p>
<p>The large size of the projector, the complex IMAX framing system and cooling
equipment, made it difficult to conceal in the theater's projector well.
Threading film into IMAX projectors is quite complex, with several checks the
projectionist must make during a pre-show inspection. The projectionist needed
room to handle the large film, and to route it to and from the enormous reels.
The projector's position in the middle of the seating area left no room for any
of this. We can speculate that it was, perhaps, one of the designer's missile
experience that lead to the solution: the projector was serviced in a large
projection room beneath the theater's seating. Once it was prepared for each
show, it rose on near-vertical rails until just the top emerged in the theater.
Rollers guided the film as it ran from a platter, up the shaft to the
projector, and back down to another platter. Cables and hoses hung below the
projector, following it up and down like the traveling cable of an elevator.</p>
<p>To advertise this system, probably the greatest advance in film projection
since the IMAX format itself, the planetarium coined the term Omnimax.</p>
<p>Omnimax was not an easy or economical format. Ideally, footage had to be taken
in the same format, using a 70mm camera with a spherical lens system. These
cameras were exceptionally large and heavy, and the huge film format limited
cinematographers to short takes. The practical problems with Omnimax filming
were big enough that the first Omnimax films faked it, projecting to the larger
spherical format from much smaller conventional negatives. This was the case
for "Voyage to the Outer Planets" and "Garden Isle," the premier films at
the Fleet planetarium. The history of both is somewhat obscure, the latter
especially.</p>
<p>"Voyage to the Outer Planets" was executive-produced by Preston Fleet, a
founder of the Fleet center (which was ultimately named for his father, a WWII
aviator). We have Fleet's sense of showmanship to thank for the invention of
Omnimax: He was an accomplished business executive, particularly in the
photography industry, and an aviation enthusiast who had his hands in more than
one museum. Most tellingly, though, he had an eccentric hobby. He was a theater
organist. I can't help but think that his passion for the theater organ, an
instrument almost defined by the combination of many gizmos under
electromechanical control, inspired "Voyage." The film, often called a
"multimedia experience," used multiple projectors throughout the planetarium to
depict a far-future journey of exploration. The Omnimax film depicted travel
through space, with slide projectors filling in artist's renderings of the many
wonders of space.</p>
<p>The ten-minute Omnimax film was produced by Graphic Films Corporation, a brand
that would become closely associated with Omnimax in the following decades.
Graphic was founded in the midst of the Second World War by Lester Novros, a
former Disney animator who found a niche creating training films for the
military. Novros's fascination with motion and expertise in presenting
complicated 3D scenes drew him to aerospace, and after the war he found much of
his business in the newly formed Air Force and NASA. He was also an enthusiast
of niche film formats, and Omnimax was not his first dome.</p>
<p>For the 1964 New York World's Fair, Novros and Graphic Films had produced "To
the Moon and Beyond," a speculative science film with thematic similarities to
"Voyage" and more than just a little mechanical similarity. It was presented in
Cinerama 360, a semi-spherical, dome-theater 70mm format presented in a special
theater called the Moon Dome. "To the Moon and Beyond" was influential in many
ways, leading to Graphic Films' involvement in "2001: A Space Odyssey" and its
enduring expertise in domes.</p>
<p>The Fleet planetarium would not remain the only Omnimax for long. In 1975, the
city of Spokane, Washington struggled to find a new application for the
pavilion built for Expo '74 [3]. A top contender: an Omnimax theater, in some
ways a replacement for the temporary IMAX theater that had been constructed for
the actual Expo. Alas, this project was not to be, but others came along: in
1978, the Detroit Science Center opened the second Omnimax theater ("the
machine itself looks like and is the size of a front loader," the <em>Detroit Free
Press</em> wrote). The Science Museum of Minnesota, in St. Paul, followed shortly
after.</p>
<p>Omnimax hit prime time the next year, with the 1979 announcement of an Omnimax
theater at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. Unlike the previous
installations, this 380-seat theater was purely commercial. It opened with the
1976 IMAX film "To Fly!," which had been optically modified to fit the Omnimax
format. This choice of first film is illuminating. "To Fly!" is a 27 minute
documentary on the history of aviation in the United States, originally
produced for the IMAX theater at the National Air and Space Museum [4]. It doesn't
exactly seem like casino fare.</p>
<p>The IMAX format, the flat-screen one, was born of world's fairs. It premiered
at an Expo, reappeared a couple of years later at another one, and for the
first years of the format most of the IMAX theaters built were associated with
either a major festival or an educational institution. This noncommercial
history is a bit hard to square with the modern IMAX brand, closely associated
with major theater chains and the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
<p>Well, IMAX took off, and in many ways it sold out. Over the decades since the
1970 Expo, IMAX has met widespread success with commercial films and theater
owners. Simultaneously, the definition or criteria for IMAX theaters have
relaxed, with smaller screens made permissible until, ultimately, the
transition to digital projection eliminated the 70mm film and more or less
reduce IMAX to just another ticket surcharge brand. It competes directly with
Cinemark xD, for example. To the theater enthusiast, this is a pretty sad turn
of events, a Westinghouse-esque zombification of a brand that once heralded the
field's most impressive technical achievements.</p>
<p>The same never happened to Omnimax. The Caesar's Omnimax theater was an odd
exception; the vast majority of Omnimax theaters were built by science museums
and the vast majority of Omnimax films were science documentaries. Quite a few
of those films had been specifically commissioned by science museums, often on
the occasion of their Omnimax theater opening. The Omnimax community was fairly
tight, and so the same names recur.</p>
<p>The Graphic Films Corporation, which had been around since the beginning,
remained so closely tied to the IMAX brand that they practically shared
identities. Most Omnimax theaters, and some IMAX theaters, used to open with a
vanity card often known as "the wormhole." It might be hard to describe beyond
"if you know you know," it certainly made an impression on everyone I know that
grew up near a theater that used it. There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDDNyDKrczs">some
videos</a>, although unfortunately
none of them are very good.</p>
<p>I have spent more hours of my life than I am proud to admit trying to untangle
the history of this clip. Over time, it has appeared in many theaters with many
different logos at the end, and several variations of the audio track. This is
in part informed speculation, but here is what I believe to be true: the
"wormhole" was originally created by Graphic Films for the Fleet planetarium
specifically, and ran before "Voyage to the Outer Planets" and its
double-feature companion "Garden Isle," both of which Graphic Films had worked
on. This original version ended with the name Graphic Films, accompanied by an
odd sketchy drawing that was also used as an early logo of the IMAX
Corporation.  Later, the same animation was re-edited to end with an IMAX logo.</p>
<p>This version ran in both Omnimax and conventional IMAX theaters, probably as a
result of the extensive "cross-pollination" of films between the two formats.
Many Omnimax films through the life of the format had actually been filmed for
IMAX, with conventional lenses, and then optically modified to fit the Omnimax
dome after the fact. You could usually tell: the reprojection process created
an unusual warp in the image, and more tellingly, these pseudo-Omnimax films
almost always centered the action at the middle of the IMAX frame, which was
too high to be quite comfortable in an Omnimax theater (where the "frame
center" was well above the "front center" point of the theater). Graphic Films
had been involved in a lot of these as well, perhaps explaining the animation
reuse, but it's just as likely that they had sold it outright to the IMAX
corporation which used it as they pleased.</p>
<p>For some reason, this version also received new audio that is mostly the same
but slightly different. I don't have a definitive explanation, but I think
there may have been an audio format change between the very early Omnimax
theaters and later IMAX/Omnimax systems, which might have required remastering.</p>
<p>Later, as Omnimax domes proliferated at science museums, the IMAX Corporation
(which very actively promoted Omnimax to education) gave many of these theaters
custom versions of the vanity card that ended with the science museum's own
logo. I have personally seen two of these, so I feel pretty confident that they
exist and weren't all that rare (basically 2 out of 2 Omnimax theaters I've
visited used one), but I cannot find any preserved copies.</p>
<p>Another recurring name in the world of IMAX and Omnimax is MacGillivray Freeman
Films. MacGillivray and Freeman were a pair of teenage friends from Laguna
Beach who dropped out of school in the '60s to make skateboard and surf films.
This is, of course, a rather cliché start for documentary filmmakers but we
must allow that it was the '60s and they were pretty much the ones creating the
cliché. Their early films are hard to find in anything better than VHS rip
quality, but worth watching: Wikipedia notes their significance in pioneering
"action cameras," mounting 16mm cinema cameras to skateboards and surfboards,
but I would say that their cinematography was innovative in more ways than just
one. The 1970 "Catch the Joy," about sandrails, has some incredible shots that
I struggle to explain. There's at least one where they definitely cut the shot
just a couple of frames before a drifting sandrail flung their camera all the
way down the dune.</p>
<p>For some reason, I would speculate due to their reputation for exciting
cinematography, the National Air and Space Museum chose MacGillivray and
Freeman for "To Fly!".  While not the first science museum IMAX documentary by
any means (that was, presumably, "Voyage to the Outer Planets" given the
different subject matter of the various Expo films), "To Fly!" might be called
the first modern one. It set the pattern that decades of science museum films
followed: a film initially written by science educators, punched up by
producers, and filmed with the very best technology of the time. Fearing that
the film's history content would be dry, they pivoted more towards
entertainment, adding jokes and action sequences. "To Fly!" was a hit, running
in just about every science museum with an IMAX theater, including Omnimax.</p>
<p>Sadly, Jim Freeman died in a helicopter crash shortly after production.
Nonetheless, MacGillivray Freeman Films went on. Over the following decades,
few IMAX science documentaries were made that didn't involve them somehow.
Besides the films they produced, the company consulted on action sequences
in most of the format's popular features.</p>
<p><img alt="Omnimax projection room at OMSI" src="https://computer.rip/f/omnimax/a.jpg"></p>
<p>I had hoped to present here a thorough history of the films that were actually
produced in the Omnimax format. Unfortunately, this has proven very difficult:
the fact that most of them were distributed only to science museums means that
they are very spottily remembered, and besides, so many of the films that ran
in Omnimax theaters were converted from IMAX presentations that it's hard to
tell the two apart. I'm disappointed that this part of cinema history isn't
better recorded, and I'll continue to put time into the effort. Science museum
documentaries don't get a lot of attention, but many of the have involved
formidable technical efforts.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the cameras: befitting the large film, IMAX cameras
themselves are very large. When filming "To Fly!", MacGillivray and Freeman
complained that the technically very basic 80 pound cameras required a lot of
maintenance, were complex to operate, and wouldn't fit into the "action cam"
mounting positions they were used to. The cameras were so expensive, and so
rare, that they had to be far more conservative than their usual approach out
of fear of damaging a camera they would not be able to replace. It turns out
that they had it easy. Later IMAX science documentaries would be filmed in
space ("The Dream is Alive" among others) and deep underwater ("Deep Sea 3D"
among others). These IMAX cameras, modified for simpler operation and housed
for such difficult environments, weighed over 1,000 pounds. Astronauts had to
be trained to operate the cameras; mission specialists on Hubble service
missions had wrangling a 70-pound handheld IMAX camera around the cabin and
developing its film in a darkroom bag among their duties. There was a lot of
film to handle: as a rule of thumb, one mile of IMAX film is good for eight
and a half minutes.</p>
<p>I grew up in Portland, Oregon, and so we will make things a bit more
approachable by focusing on one example: The Omnimax theater of the Oregon
Museum of Science and Industry, which opened as part of the museum's new
waterfront location in 1992. This 330-seat boasted a 10,000 sq ft dome and 15
kW of sound. The premier feature was "Ring of Fire," a volcano documentary
originally commissioned by the Fleet, the Fort Worth Museum of Science and
Industry, and the Science Museum of Minnesota. By the 1990s, the later era of
Omnimax, the dome format was all but abandoned as a commercial concept. There
were, an announcement article notes, around 90 total IMAX theaters (including
Omnimax) and 80 Omnimax films (including those converted from IMAX) in '92.
Considering the heavy bias towards science museums among these theaters, it
was very common for the films to be funded by consortia of those museums.</p>
<p>Considering the high cost of filming in IMAX, a lot of the documentaries had a
sort of "mashup" feel. They would combine footage taken in different times and
places, often originally for other projects, into a new narrative. "Ring of
Fire" was no exception, consisting of a series of sections that were sometimes
more loosely connected to the theme. The 1982 Loma Prieta earthquake was a
focus, and the eruption of Mt. St. Helens, and lava flows in Hawaii. Perhaps
one of the reasons it's hard to catalog IMAX films is this mashup quality, many
of the titles carried at science museums were something along the lines of
"another ocean one." I don't mean this as a criticism, many of the IMAX
documentaries were excellent, but they were necessarily composed from
painstakingly gathered fragments and had to cover wide topics.</p>
<p>Given that I have an announcement feature piece in front of me, let's also use
the example of OMSI to discuss the technical aspects. OMSI's projector cost
about $2 million and weighted about two tons. To avoid dust damaging the
expensive prints, the "projection room" under the seating was a
positive-pressure cleanroom. This was especially important since the paucity of
Omnimax content meant that many films ran regularly for years. The 15 kW
water-cooled lamp required replacement at 800 to 1,000 hours, but
unfortunately, the price is not noted.</p>
<p>By the 1990s, Omnimax had become a rare enough system that the projection
technology was a major part of the appeal. OMSI's installation, like most later
Omnimax theaters, had the audience queue below the seating, separated from the
projection room by a glass wall. The high cost of these theaters meant that
they operated on high turnovers, so patrons would wait in line to enter
immediately after the previous showing had exited. While they waited, they
could watch the projectionist prepare the next show while a museum docent
explained the equipment.</p>
<p>I have written before about <a href="https://computer.rip/2024-01-21-multi-channel-audio-part-1.html">multi-channel audio
formats</a>, and
Omnimax gives us some more to consider. The conventional audio format for much
of Omnimax's life was six-channel: left rear, left screen, center screen, right
screen, right rear, and top. Each channel had an independent bass cabinet (in
one theater, a "caravan-sized" enclosure with eight JBL 2245H 46cm woofers),
and a crossover network fed the lowest end of all six channels to a "sub-bass"
array at screen bottom. The original Fleet installation also had sub-bass
speakers located beneath the audience seating, although that doesn't seem to
have become common.</p>
<p>IMAX titles of the '70s and '80s delivered audio on eight-track magnetic tape,
with the additional tracks used for synchronization to the film. By the '90s,
IMAX had switched to distributing digital audio on three CDs (one for each two
channels). OMSI's theater was equipped for both, and the announcement amusingly
notes the availability of cassette decks. A semi-custom audio processor made
for IMAX, the Sonics TAC-86, managed synchronization with film playback and
applied equalization curves individually calibrated to the theater.</p>
<p>IMAX domes used perforated aluminum screens (also the norm in later
planetaria), so the speakers were placed behind the screen in the scaffold-like
superstructure that supported it. When I was young, OMSI used to start
presentations with a demo program that explained the large size of IMAX film
before illuminating work lights behind the screen to make the speakers visible.
Much of this was the work of the surprisingly sophisticated show control system
employed by Omnimax theaters, a descendent of the PDP-15 originally installed
in the Fleet.</p>
<p>Despite Omnimax's almost complete consignment to science museums, there were
some efforts it bringing commercial films. Titles like Disney's "Fantasia" and
"Star Wars: Episode III" were distributed to Omnimax theaters via optical
reprojection, sometimes even from 35mm originals. Unfortunately, the quality of
these adaptations was rarely satisfactory, and the short runtimes (and
marketing and exclusivity deals) typical of major commercial releases did not
always work well with science museum schedules. Still, the cost of converting
an existing film to dome format is pretty low, so the practice continues today.
"Star Wars: The Force Awakens," for example, ran on at least one science museum
dome. This trickle of blockbusters was not enough to make commercial Omnimax
theaters viable.</p>
<p>Caesars Palace closed, and then demolished, their Omnimax theater in 2000. The
turn of the 21st century was very much the beginning of the end for the dome
theater. IMAX was moving away from their film system and towards digital
projection, but digital projection systems suitable for large domes were still
a nascent technology and extremely expensive. The end of aggressive support
from IMAX meant that filming costs became impractical for documentaries, so
while some significant IMAX science museum films were made in the 2000s, the
volume definitely began to lull and the overall industry moved away from IMAX
in general and Omnimax especially.</p>
<p>It's surprising how unforeseen this was, at least to some. A ten-screen
commercial theater in Duluth opened an Omnimax theater in 1996! Perhaps due to
the sunk cost, it ran until 2010, not a bad closing date for an Omnimax
theater. Science museums, with their relatively tight budgets and less
competitive nature, did tend to hold over existing Omnimax installations well
past their prime. Unfortunately, many didn't: OMSI, for example, closed its
Omnimax theater in 2013 for replacement with a conventional digital theater
that has a large screen but is not IMAX branded.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some operators hung onto their increasingly costly Omnimax domes
long enough for modernization to become practical. The IMAX Corporation
abandoned the Omnimax name as more of the theaters closed, but continued to
support "IMAX Dome" with the introduction of a digital laser projector with
spherical optics. There are only ten examples of this system. Others, including
Omnimax's flagship at the Fleet Science Center, have been replaced by custom
dome projection systems built by competitors like Sony.</p>
<p>Few Omnimax projectors remain. The Fleet, to their credit, installed the modern
laser projectors in front of the projector well so that the original film
projector could remain in place. It's still functional and used for reprisals
of Omnimax-era documentaries. IMAX projectors in general are a dying breed, a
number of them have been preserved but their complex, specialized design and
the end of vendor support means that it may become infeasible to keep them
operating.</p>
<p>We are, of course, well into the digital era. While far from inexpensive,
digital projection systems are now able to match the quality of Omnimax
projection.  The newest dome theaters, like the Sphere, dispense with
projection entirely. Instead, they use LED display panels capable of far
brighter and more vivid images than projection, and with none of the complexity
of water-cooled arc lamps.</p>
<p>Still, something has been lost. There was once a parallel theater industry, a
world with none of the glamor of Hollywood but for whom James Cameron hauled a
camera to the depths of the ocean and Leonardo DiCaprio narrated repairs to the
Hubble. In a good few dozen science museums, two-ton behemoths rose from
beneath the seats, the zenith of film projection technology. After decades of
documentaries, I think people forgot how remarkable these theaters were.</p>
<p>Science museums stopped promoting them as aggressively, and much of the
showmanship faded away. Sometime in the 2000s, OMSI stopped running the
pre-show demonstration, instead starting the film directly. They stopped
explaining the projectionist's work in preparing the show, and as they shifted
their schedule towards direct repetition of one feature, there was less for the
projectionist to do anyway. It became just another museum theater, so it's no
wonder that they replaced it with just another museum theater: a generic
big-screen setup with the exceptionally dull name of "Empirical Theater."</p>
<p>From time to time, there have been whispers of a resurgence of 70mm film.
Oppenheimer, for example, was distributed to a small number of theaters in this
giant of film formats: 53 reels, 11 miles, 600 pounds of film. Even
conventional IMAX is too costly for the modern theater industry, though.
Omnimax has fallen completely by the wayside, with the few remaining dome
operators doomed to recycling the same films with a sprinkling of newer
reformatted features. It is hard to imagine a collective of science museums
sending another film camera to space.</p>
<p>Omnimax poses a preservation challenge in more ways than one. Besides the lack
of documentation on Omnimax theaters and films, there are precious few
photographs of Omnimax theaters and even fewer videos of their presentations.
Of course, the historian suffers where Madison Square Garden hopes to succeed:
the dome theater is perhaps the ultimate in location-based entertainment.
Photos and videos, represented on a flat screen, cannot reproduce the
experience of the Omnimax theater. The 180 horizontal degrees of screen, the
sound that was always a little too loud, in no small part to mask the sound of
the projector that made its own racket in the middle of the seating. You had to
be there.</p>

an "economy" Spitz came in over $30,000 (~10x that much today).</p>
<p>[2] Pink Floyd's landmark album <em>Dark Side of The Moon</em> debuted in a release
event held at the London Planetarium. This connection between Pink Floyd and
planetaria, apparently much disliked by the band itself, has persisted to the
present day. Several generations of Pink Floyd laser shows have been licensed
by science museums around the world, and must represent by far the largest
success of fixed-installation laser projection.</p>
<p>[3] Are you starting to detect a theme with these Expos? the World's Fairs,
including in their various forms as Expos, were long one of the main markets
for niche film formats. Any given weird projection format you run into, there's
a decent chance that it was originally developed for some short film for an
Expo. Keep in mind that it's the nature of niche projection formats that they
cannot easily be shown in conventional theaters, so they end up coupled to
these crowd events where a custom venue can be built.</p>
<p>[4] The Smithsonian Institution started looking for an exciting new theater in
1970. As an example of the various niche film formats at the time, the
Smithsonian considered a dome (presumably Omnimax), Cinerama (a three-projector
ultrawide system), and Circle-Vision 360 (known mostly for the few surviving
Expo films at Disney World's EPCOT) before settling on IMAX. The Smithsonian
theater, first planned for the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History before
being integrated into the new National Air and Space Museum, was tremendously
influential on the broader world of science museum films. That is perhaps an
understatement, it is sometimes credited with popularizing IMAX in general, and
the newspaper coverage the new theater received throughout North America lends
credence to the idea. It is interesting, then, to imagine how different our
world would be if they had chosen Circle-Vision. "Captain America: Brave New
World" in Cinemark 360.</p>

Both works, the former implicitly and the latter explicitly, suggest that the foundation of the AI industry is a scam.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">To call AI a con isn’t to say that the technology is not remarkable, that it has no use, or that it will not transform the world (perhaps for the better) in the right hands.

They are AI illiterate—understandably, because of the misleading ways its loudest champions describe the technology, and troublingly, because that illiteracy makes them vulnerable to one of the most concerning near-term AI threats: the possibility that they will enter into corrosive relationships (intellectual, spiritual, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a63510531/ai-boyfriend-emotional-labor-explained-essay/">romantic</a>) with machines that only seem like they have ideas or emotions.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Few phenomena demonstrate the perils that can accompany AI illiteracy as well as “Chatgpt induced psychosis,” the subject of a recent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-spiritual-delusions-destroying-human-relationships-1235330175/"><em>Rolling Stone</em> article</a> about the growing number of people who think their LLM is a sapient spiritual guide. Some users have come to believe that the chatbot they’re interacting with is a god—“ChatGPT Jesus,” as a man whose wife fell prey to LLM-inspired delusions put it—while others are convinced, with the encouragement of their AI, that they themselves are metaphysical sages in touch with the deep structure of life and the cosmos. A teacher quoted anonymously in the article said that ChatGPT began calling her partner “spiral starchild” and “river walker” in interactions that moved him to tears. “He started telling me he made his AI self-aware,” she said, “and that it was teaching him how to talk to God, or sometimes that the bot was God—and then that he himself was God.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Although we can’t know the state of these people’s minds before they ever fed a prompt into a large language model, this story highlights a problem that Bender and Hanna describe in <em>The AI Con</em>: People have trouble wrapping their heads around the nature of a machine that produces language and regurgitates knowledge without having humanlike intelligence. The authors observe that large language models take advantage of the brain’s tendency to associate language with thinking: “We encounter text that looks just like something a person might have said and reflexively interpret it, through our usual process of imagining a mind behind the text. But there is no mind there, and we need to be conscientious to let go of that imaginary mind we have constructed.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Several other AI-related social problems, also springing from human misunderstanding of the technology, are looming. The uses of AI that Silicon Valley seems most eager to promote center on replacing human relationships with digital proxies. Consider the ever-expanding universe of AI therapists and AI-therapy adherents, who <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/14/health/chatgpt-is-my-therapist-its-more-qualified-than-any-human-could-be/">declare</a> that “ChatGPT is my therapist—it’s more qualified than any human could be.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Witness, too, how seamlessly Mark Zuckerberg went from selling the idea that Facebook would lead to a flourishing of human friendship to, now, selling the notion that Meta will provide you <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/mark-zuckerberg-ai-digital-future-0bb04de7">with AI friends</a> to replace the human pals you have lost in our alienated social-media age. The cognitive-robotics professor Tony Prescott has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/27/could-ai-help-cure-downward-spiral-of-human-loneliness">asserted</a>, “In an age when many people describe their lives as lonely, there may be value in having AI companionship as a form of reciprocal social interaction that is stimulating and personalised.” The fact that the very point of friendship is that it is not personalized—that friends are humans whose interior lives we have to consider and reciprocally negotiate, rather than mere vessels for our own self-actualization—does not seem to occur to him.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/11/home-internet-landline-amazon-smartphone/676070/">Read: Life really is better without the internet</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">This same flawed logic has led Silicon Valley to champion artificial intelligence as a cure for romantic frustrations. Whitney Wolfe Herd, the founder of the dating app Bumble, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/10/bumble-founder-whitney-wolfe-herd-says-ai-could-date-for-you.html">proclaimed</a> last year that the platform may soon allow users to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/05/ai-dating-algorithms-relationships/678422/">automate dating</a> itself, disrupting old-fashioned human courtship by providing them with an AI “dating concierge” that will interact with other users’ concierges until the chatbots find a good fit. Herd doubled down on these claims in a lengthy <em>New York Times</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/10/magazine/whitney-wolfe-herd-interview.html">interview</a> last month. Some technologists want to cut out the human altogether: See the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashishrivastava/2024/09/10/the-prompt-demand-for-ai-girlfriends-is-on-the-rise/">booming</a> market for “AI girlfriends.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Although each of these AI services aims to replace a different sphere of human activity, they all market themselves through what Hao calls the industry’s “tradition of anthropomorphizing”: talking about LLMs as though they contain humanlike minds, and selling them to the public on this basis. Many world-transforming Silicon Valley technologies from the past 30 years have been promoted as a way to increase human happiness, connection, and self-understanding—in theory—only to produce the opposite in practice. These technologies maximize shareholder value while minimizing attention spans, literacy, and social cohesion. And as Hao emphasizes, they frequently rely on grueling and at times traumatizing labor performed by some of the world’s poorest people. She introduces us, for example, to Mophat Okinyi, a former low-paid content moderator in Kenya, whom, according to Hao’s reporting, OpenAI tasked with sorting through posts describing horrifying acts (“parents raping their children, kids having sex with animals”) to help improve ChatGPT. “These two features of technology revolutions—their promise to deliver progress and their tendency instead to reverse it for people out of power, especially the most vulnerable,” Hao writes, “are perhaps truer than ever for the moment we now find ourselves in with artificial intelligence.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The good news is that nothing about this is inevitable: According to a study released in April by the Pew Research Center, although 56 percent of “AI experts” think artificial intelligence will make the United States better, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/04/03/how-the-us-public-and-ai-experts-view-artificial-intelligence/">only 17 percent</a> of American adults think so. If many Americans don’t quite understand how artificial “intelligence” works, they also certainly don’t trust it. This suspicion, no doubt provoked by recent examples of Silicon Valley con artistry, is something to build on. So is this insight from the <em>Rolling Stone</em> article: The teacher interviewed in the piece, whose significant other had AI-induced delusions, said the situation began improving when she explained to him that his chatbot was “talking to him as if he is the next messiah” only because of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/">a faulty software update</a> that made ChatGPT more sycophantic. If people understand what large language models are and are not; what they can and cannot do; what work, interactions, and parts of life they should—and should not—replace, they may be spared its worst consequences.</p><hr><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><small><em>​​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

Yes, maybe morning nurses are fresher and more alert, but…well, randomization doesn’t fix evening nurse performance (</span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36707921/" rel="">which does dip during the night</a><span>!), but I am inclined to believe the errors aren’t so high there as to cause this magnitude of a survival shift. </span></p><p><span>Okay. Well. </span><strong>Maybe</strong><span> there is something here. Caveats on this of course being a conference presentation without a corresponding, longer peer-reviewed paper, so we lack a lot of exact details on what exactly went on.

But this evidence </span><strong>combined</strong><span> with the extremely similar results from the randomized clinical trial done I showed at the start of this essay should lead us towards at least suspecting that this is an honest-to-god free lunch. </span></p><p>What’s going on? Where is this coming from? </p><p><span>First, it’s worth reminding ourselves that the human body — and perhaps most complex life on Earth — exists on a schedule: the circadian rhythm. There exist 15-or-so ‘clock’ genes, like BMAL1, CLOCK, PER, and CRY, that oscillate with a rhythm. Not in structure or conformation, but in </span><strong>expression</strong><span>; </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3758473/" rel="">the amount of them present in cells rises and falls over the course of the day</a><span>. BMAL1 and CLOCK form a complex that drives the expression of PER and CRY. Once PER and CRY accumulate to a certain threshold, they feed back to inhibit BMAL1 and CLOCK, suppressing their own production. Over time, PER and CRY degrade, releasing the inhibition, and the cycle begins again. </span></p><p><span>One full loop takes just about 24~ hours, </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8363277/" rel="">though there is some degree of individual variation.</a></p><p><span>So our cells have evolved to take advantage of these genes as an internal timestamp, a marker of where we are in the circadian rhythm. Some things occur early in the cycle, some things occur later, purely as a matter of convenience.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-165378453" href="https://www.owlposting.com/p/the-time-of-day-that-immunotherapy#footnote-2-165378453" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> </span></p><p>What’s the point of the cycle? One way to understand them is through an evolutionary lens, a way for the body to prepare for dependable environment cues. </p><p>For example, at the start of our circadian rhythm, we wake up. We crawl out of our safe cocoon — a private bed in modernity, or a predator-sheltered hole in ancient history — and start to engage in very risky behavior, immunologically speaking. Eating leftover food that may be contaminated, being scrapped by bacteria-covered rocks, holding dead animals to roast for dinner, and so on. But, as night comes, we retreat back to our private beds or holes, feasting on freshly cooked food, few interactions with unknown creatures, and little chance for injury as we wind down. </p><p><span>To anthropomorphize for a minute, millennia of evolution likely recognized this phenomena, and </span><strong>also</strong><span> noted that loading up an immune response is an unfortunately long process. A dendritic cell floating in the blood stream must first recognize + grab onto an antigen, then it needs to crawl into the lymphatic system, and </span><strong>then</strong><span> it hopes to bump into the few naive T-cell that recognizes that specific antigen. </span><strong>Then</strong><span> the adaptive immune response can kick off.</span></p><p>How could evolution optimize this process?</p><p>Well…if you didn’t have any priors on when new antigens would come through the door, you wouldn’t care when T cells decided to exit/enter the lymphatic system. When they exit, they are moving to new tissue. When they enter, they are actively looking for dendritic cells to bind to. Perfectly fine to do this randomly in the null case of uniform antigen exposure. </p><p><span>But! If you believe that antigen load is highest in the morning (which is something you can track via the clock genes), it would be smart to ensure that the lymphatic system is bloated with lymphocytes in the morning, removing their ability to migrate into the bloodstream. </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5263259/" rel="">And according to one paper, that does empirically turn out to be the case in mouse models!</a><span> Here’s a particularly useful graph:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png" width="372" height="390" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:390,&quot;width&quot;:372,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:162392,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.owlposting.com/i/165378453?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F452e6b88-b6e2-454e-bd65-8051be0fefa3_372x390.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>The authors characterize the lymphocytes (T cells and B cells) of mice and find that it is highest during the resting period for mice (ZT 1-9), meaning that they are currently migrating throughout the body. Once the mice get closer to awakening (ZT10), circulating lymphocytes sharply drop, implying that they have moved themselves into the lymphatic system, awaiting for the morning antigens to arrive. Finally, </span><strong>the authors demonstrate that this entire process entirely depends on clock genes</strong><span>. If they are genetically edited out, bloodstream lymphocytes stay constant. </span></p><p>But this is just one immune-circadian tweak that evolution has made. Are there others?</p><p><span>How about prime T-cells such that they are more ‘willing’ to be activated by antigen-presenting dendritic cells at the start of the circadian rhythm? </span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1905080116" rel="">That exists</a><span>.

In the common case of immune checkpoint blockades, it is simply allowing the immune system to more easily attack the cancer, since cancer typically chemically dampens their ability to do so. That’s all it does. It doesn’t provide new antigens, it doesn’t create new T-cell receptors, it doesn’t summon dendritic cells. </span><strong>Which means the effectiveness of that green light depends entirely on what the immune system is already doing at that moment.</strong></p><p>Thus, we can propose a decent argument as to why immunotherapies seem to work best during the start of a circadian rhythm. The immune system, by evolutionary coincidence, is simply most prepared to begin their assault during that time. </p><p><span>But you may balk at this and say, “</span><em>That would only make sense if immune checkpoint blockades had an extremely short half life that fit into this primed immune system period, but they don’t.</em><span> </span><em>To take an example,</em><span> </span><em><span>Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) has an </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK546616/" rel="">extremely long half life of 27 days</a><span>, is dosed every 3 weeks, and</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5613934/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel=""> reaches steady-state blood levels at 19 weeks</a><span>. How could it possibly be affected by initial infusion time?”. </span></em></p><p>Well, you’ve got me there! I am unsure what the answer could be. And as far as I can tell, so is everyone else, nobody has a clear, consistent answer to the question. But let’s take a stab at it. </p><p><span>Let’s pretend you have very early-stage cancer. The dendritic cells are in their normal cycle of desperately presenting tumor fragments to T cells, the T-cells rightfully getting upset, activating themselves, and going off to hunt the cancer. But cancer simply shuts them down by expressing an immune blocker protein: PD-L1. In response, the T-cell mostly shuts down, wanders back to the lymphatic system, and </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis2015162" rel="">gets a little bit more ‘exhausted’.</a><span> It believes that it activated itself for no reason, and thus will require a much higher bar for doing anything else in the future. The more times this occurs, the more exhausted the T-cell becomes, the more unwilling to ever activate again.</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3595615/" rel=""> In the limit, it will simply kill itself. </a><span>Hence why you need immunotherapy to revitalize these cells!</span></p><p><span>Now let’s assume you received the immune checkpoint blocker </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrolizumab" rel="">Pembrolizumab</a><em> </em><span>at one of the best possible times: 7:30am in the morning, when the most T-cells are in your lymphatic system. Those get activated by the dendritic cells and are now finally able to attack the cancer, the checkpoint blocker preventing them from shutting down. Cancer is being killed! What advantages are you potentially privy to now as a result of the morning dose? </span></p><p>Of course all the ones we talked about earlier: </p><ul><li><p>A greater number of T-cells are in the lymphatic system, so more opportunity to prevent exhaustion.</p></li><li><p>Dendritic cells are more aggressively collecting cancer antigens, so more opportunity for T cells to be activated.</p></li><li><p>The lymphatic system is more permissible to dendritic cell entry, allowing more interactions between dendritic cells and T-cells.</p></li></ul><p>And so on. </p><p><span>But, all of this would </span><strong>also </strong><span>eventually happen if you had an evening injection. If we squint, the only downside an evening injection would have is that the highest concentration of the drug (at the moment of injection) does not have access to all of these advantages.</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9256782/" rel=""> But given the clearance rate of Pembrolizumab, only 1.25% of it would have dropped in the 12 hours from the evening injection → following morning</a><span>. </span><strong>So the morning injection upside entirely stands on this +1.25% drug concentration bump.</strong><span> Either we are missing something, or the sum total of the initial 12-hour-long immune advantages are so high that +1.25% is extremely significant. </span></p><p>Perhaps the second take is genuinely true and answers the story entirely. Lots of immunologically useful things are going on in the morning, each contributing a little bit. As is often the case in biology, there is no singular causal factor for why early-morning immunotherapy seems to help so much, just many small things. </p><p>But let’s veer off into speculation. Maybe we are missing something?</p><p><strong>Perhaps we’re being overoptimistic on this idea of ‘steady state circulating antibodies’ being useful for T-cell activation</strong><span>. Maybe the first immediate dose of immunotherapy is the primary part that functionally </span><strong>matters</strong><span> for further T-cell activation.

So you’d ideally want the first ceiling to be as high as possible, which implies that a morning injection would be best! Is this true? Well, we do know that the </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30804515/" rel="">clinical impact of the first immunotherapy injection is strongly tied to long term outcomes</a><span>, and, accordingly, </span><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2824%2900410-0" rel="">the timing of that </a><strong><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2824%2900410-0" rel="">first</a></strong><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2824%2900410-0" rel=""> immunotherapy injection seems to matter the most</a><span>. This same latter paper also says this:</span></p><blockquote><p><span> …</span><em>it appears that challenging the immune system with an antibody at a specific time of day not only changes the quantity but also the quality of the response so that the immune system, once stimulated at the “wrong” time, may not be able to respond anymore to the same level and quality as an immune system challenged at the “right” time—just 12 h apart. </em></p></blockquote><p><span>Hence, why we should suspect that there is something fundamentally </span><strong>special</strong><span> about the first wave of activation of T-cells. </span></p><p>Of course, many questions follow from this. What is the temporal “window of imprintability” for T cells? Does that imply that early-activated T-cell clones dominate the final pool of T-cells? And what would mechanistically cause all of this? I don’t have the answer to any of these, and I suspect nobody does. </p><p>But again, maybe this is the wrong idea entirely, and there is no singular causal factor for these impressive time-of-day results. Maybe it is, once again, a bunch of small things — increased T-cell activation, but also stronger dendritic cell function and increased lymphatic vessel permissibility and many others — adding up to a strong signal. </p><p><span>For what it’s worth, we do know that this</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4874947/" rel=""> ‘early morning immunotherapy is useful’ phenomenon are also important for infectious disease vaccines, </a><span>so it feels unlikely that this whole observation is entirely spurious. But vaccines mostly contain short-lived antigens and one-shot adjuvant signals, meaning they rely heavily on getting the initial priming window exactly right. That’s not the case for immunotherapy, so I suspect the benefits of morning injections in that context arise from a different mechanism—one that’s distinct from what makes morning timing valuable for vaccines.</span></p><p><span>We’ll see what the future holds. The phase 3 trial page that we talked about at the start </span><a href="https://www.centerwatch.com/clinical-trials/listings/NCT05549037/effect-of-time-of-day-tod-for-immunochemotherapy-on-pfs-in-nsclc?NewOnly=Y&amp;city=Chang%20Sha&amp;country=China" rel="">is still ongoing</a><span> and is currently the only randomized test of chronoimmunotherapy.

Incredibly interesting subject, please reach out to me if you have any interesting light to shed here!</span></p><p><em>Edit on 08/06/2024</em></p><p><span>At least one person has mentioned that chronotherapy was also thought to matter for blood pressure medication, with rather convincing large retrospective studies, specifically the </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31641769/" rel="">HYGIA trial</a><span>. There was some mild mechanistic reason to suggest that circadian variation in sympathetic tone and cortisol levels could influence blood pressure regulation; going up when you sleep, potentially leading to more cardiac events. Thus, bedtime dosing of antihypertensives may prevent the ‘</span><em>potentially harmful territory</em><span>’ spike. </span></p><p><span>But multiple follow-up randomized studies, such as </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833860" rel="">this</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)01786-X/fulltext" rel="">this</a><span> largely disproved the whole concept. Given that, shouldn’t we be on guard for chronotherapy working in immunotherapy? </span></p><p>Well, yes! We should be on guard for everything, especially since our only major piece of evidence is a as-of-yet incomplete trial. But I’m personally erring on the side of the connection between the immune system and the circadian rhythm being much stronger than it is for other physiological functions, just given how large the lymphocyte concentrations in the bloodstream can shift from night to day. I’m also betting a little on the first wave of T-cell activation being particularly important, for reasons that are still not understood. Very open to being completely wrong though!</p><p><span>On a bigger note, </span><a href="https://x.com/houndcl/status/1929649189560197408" rel="">someone else mentioned that the clinical trial

It requires a lot of time through regular practice. By bending, even the semitones can be sounded on the harmonica through special drawing and blowing techniques, which cannot be reached by regular playing of the channels. Beginners ask themselves, "Is that bending now or is the semitone exactly hit?" </p> <p> The lean and performant <em>Lets' Bend</em> app makes it easy and fun for anyone to master the art of bending. By visualising the notes you play, you'll be bending like a pro in no time. </p> <p> A short video about the functionality is published here:</p> <video controls="" width="100%"><source src="https://letsbend.de/videos/android_3.4.0.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video> <p> The original idea in developing the <em>Let's Bend</em> app was to create an application that is available on all common operating systems and whose application window scales well. It is not uncommon to have other applications open while practising or to want to use the programme on different devices. Last but not least, all keys and the most common special tunings of harmonicas should be supported.</p>  <p> As a result, there are now two versions of the app. A desktop version for the operating systems macOS, Debian and Windows, and an Android version for mobile devices.</p> <p> The Android version is published free of charge and without advertising on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schliweb.bluesharpbendingapp&amp;hl=en">Google Play</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Christian-Kierdorf-Lets-Bend/dp/B0C96X2KRG">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://f-droid.org/de/packages/de.schliweb.bluesharpbendingapp/">F-Droid</a>.</p> <p> Since a publication on Microsoft Store and Apple App Store is associated with additional development costs that exceed the financial effort of a hobby development project, the desktop version was not published there. Instead, <a href="https://letsbend.de/download.html">here is an alternative download option for the desktop version.</a> </p> <p> As a preview, there is a <a href="https://letsbend.de/letsbend.html">web version</a> available here.</p> <p>For detailed instructions, check out our <a href="https://letsbend.de/doc.html">User Guide</a>.</p> <p> The source code of the applications is published <a href="https://github.com/egdels/bluesharpbendingapp">here.</a> </p><p> If you would like to support the developer of <em>Let's Bend</em> by making a voluntary donation, there is a <em>Buy me a coffee</em> function in the desktop version. But even here, <em>Let's Bend</em> remains free of charge. </p> <p> But enough talk now. <em>Let's Bend!</em></p></div></div>]]></description>
