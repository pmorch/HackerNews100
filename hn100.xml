<p dir="auto">A data hoarder’s dream come true: bundle any web page into a single HTML file. You can finally replace that gazillion of open tabs with a gazillion of .html files stored somewhere on your precious little drive.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unlike the conventional “Save page as”, <code>monolith</code> not only saves the target document, it embeds CSS, image, and JavaScript assets <strong>all at once</strong>, producing a single HTML5 document that is a joy to store and share.</p>
<p dir="auto">If compared to saving websites with <code>wget -mpk</code>, this tool embeds all assets as data URLs and therefore lets browsers render the saved page exactly the way it was on the Internet, even when no network connection is available.</p>

<div id="article-body">
<p>Not for the first time, Microsoft has struck upon a winning formula for irritating the hell out of Windows users: pop-up ads in your browser! The latest Windows update was released several days ago, though I only got around to it today, and after installation inserts pop-up adverts into Google Chrome.</p><p>I couldn't believe what I was seeing: a little box comes up in the bottom right corner of the browser, advertising the Bing search engine and BingAI. My first thought was that I'd downloaded something malicious, perhaps while fiddling with mods, because the pop-up didn't exactly look classy, more like the kind of thing you see on suspicious websites. But I set off a quick antivirus scan and googled the issue (in Chrome naturally), and quickly found plenty of folk complaining about the same thing.</p><p>So first of all: Really, Microsoft? Most of us rely on Windows, it has an absolute stranglehold on the OS market, and is therefore able to intrude on our PC experience like few other companies (outside perhaps Google itself). This particular pop-up will, if you click "yes" to its prompt, set Bing as the default search engine within Chrome.</p><p>It did this last year, too, adding pop-ups to Windows 10 and 11 that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23851902/microsoft-bing-popups-windows-11-malware" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23851902/microsoft-bing-popups-windows-11-malware"><u>appeared over the top of other apps</u></a> suggesting Microsoft-made alternatives, before removing them due to "unintended behaviour."</p><p>Microsoft has confirmed the pop-ups are genuine Microsoft adverts, and says they should only appear once.

Almost unbelievably she frames this as a perk for users, who get some Copilot bonuses if they accept the BingAI prompt, then ends with this magnificently brazen claim: "We value providing our customers with choice, so there is an option to dismiss the notification."</p><p>What really annoys me about Windows is that it doesn't respect my choices over time, but seems to override them on a whim in certain updates and make my machine start doing things Microsoft wants but I don't want. I wouldn't be so bothered about Microsoft's various attempts to fool me into using Bing if I could just say "no thanks" at some point and have that respected over multiple updates.&nbsp;</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hbKqpcu45pavAoR4UREVqD"><section><p>Sign up to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked by the editors.</p></section></div><p>When Windows is annoying, Windows has failed.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This sentiment gets stronger every day I follow the web development scene. Surely there are many ( in absolute numbers ) that require complex infra but majority of websites and apps get &lt;10 rps and 50 on a busy day. </p>

<p>Obviously latency is lower if there are endpoints around the world but the data still needs to be accessed. What's the point of being 20ms away from client if the db is 200ms away from that endpoint? And yes, someone has to pay for all that infrastructure.</p>

<p>Obviously caching is useful but that's something you get with a cdn or just plain http caching. Often the whole thing can live on cdn, just push the new files after updates. Maybe a few api endpoints are needed for some dynamic functionality but that can be handled for example with JavaScript. </p>

<p>Most projects might as well run in container on $5 vps. That would likely be faster as well, at least it's running and probably with a local db.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>China has introduced guidelines to phase out US microprocessors from Intel and AMD from government personal computers and servers, the Financial Times reported on Sunday (Mar 24).</p>

<p>The procurement guidance also seeks to sideline Microsoft's Windows operating system and foreign-made database software in favour of domestic options, the report said.</p>

<p>Government agencies above the township level have been told to include criteria requiring "safe and reliable" processors and operating systems when making purchases, the newspaper said.</p>

<p>China's industry ministry in late December issued a statement with three separate lists of CPUs, operating systems and centralised database deemed "safe and reliable" for three years after the publication date, all from Chinese companies, Reuters checks showed.</p>

<p>The State Council Information Office, which handles media queries for the council, China's Cabinet, did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.</p>

<p>Intel and AMD did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.</p>

<p>The US has been aiming to boost domestic semiconductor output and reduce reliance on China and Taiwan with the Biden administration's 2022 CHIPS and Science Act.</p>

<p>It is designed to bolster US semiconductors and contains financial aid for domestic production with subsidies for production of advanced chips.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p id="9c3e">I implemented search and filtering for entities on our product at epilot. The users were heavily using the feature, however, a unique issue surfaced: difficulties in filtering file names containing diacritical marks like umlauts (<code>Äpfel</code>,&nbsp;<code>über</code>,&nbsp;<code>schön</code>, etc.).</p>



<p id="b54a">Intrigued, I delved into the logic to investigate. Initially, everything seemed in order. For instance, a file named “blöb” was saved precisely as “blöb” — no bizarre encoding alterations were apparent.</p>



<p id="0f99">Can you spot any difference between “blöb” and “blöb”?</p>



<p id="9a66">This time instead of typing the word in the search bar, I copied it from the uploaded and saved filename, and and voilà, the search functioned perfectly! 🤯. This definitely meant the file name was subtly altered upon upload, hinting at a background encoding transformation.</p>



<p id="49f9">So, as anyone would, I employed the power of&nbsp;<code>encodeURIComponent</code>&nbsp;to see for myself what really was different.</p>



<p>There it was! The different types of encoding forms that led to this. Now you might be wondering (<em>I was wondering too!</em>):</p>



<p><em>As if worrying about encoding wasn’t enough, now we’ve got to stress over its different types too 🤦‍♀ and wait, its 2024, and we are still grappling with Unicode character encoding problems?</em></p>

<p>The culprits in this case were these two contrasting encoding types:&nbsp;<code><strong>%C3%BC</strong></code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code><strong>%CC%88</strong></code>, leading to the search malfunction.

<p><b>Case Study: What Happens When a Fifteen Year Old Pumps and Dumps,
Obtaining a Net Profit of Nearly $800,000?<span>�
</span>The SEC Settles for $285,000.<o:p></o:p></b></p>



<p>Jonathan Lebed and
two of his friends came in fourth place in a stock-picking contest sponsored by
CNBC when he was just twelve years old.<span>�
</span>They had managed to turn an imaginary $10,000 into $240,000 during the
first round of the competition.<span>� </span>From
there, Lebed was able to convince his parents to invest money in the stock
market on his behalf.<span>� </span>His parents first
opened an Ameritrade account for him, and upon his mother�s decision to close
that account, his father opened an E*Trade account for him.<span>� </span>During two years of trading, Lebed made a
minimum of 27 trades, and netted nearly $800,000.<span>� </span>The SEC later investigated these 27 trades and eventually
declared eleven of them as illegal trades and forced to Lebed to pay
approximately $272,000 in fines and over $12,000 in interest.<span>� </span>In particular, these eleven trades occurred
during the five and a half month period between August 23, 1999, and February
4, 2000.<span>� </span>While Lebed never admitted or
denied the findings by the SEC, he consented to entry of the findings and the
imposition of sanctions.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[1]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a></p>

<p>The SEC findings
asserted that Lebed would purchase large blocks of thinly traded microcap
stocks, post between 200 and 300 messages on the Yahoo! Finance message boards,
hyping the stocks he had just purchased, and then sell all of the stocks he had
purchased, usually within twenty-four hours of said purchase.<span>� </span>The messages that Lebed posted would predict
marked increases in the stocks value, i.e. he would post comments that this
stock would be the �next stock to gain 1,000%� or that a stock currently
trading at just over a dollar would be trading at more than $20 per share �very
soon.�<span>� </span>In response to Lebed�s messages,
trading volume of these stocks would soar on average from 60,000 shares per day
to over a million shares on the days he posted his messages.<span>�� </span>For the eleven trades that the SEC declared
its findings, Lebed realized a net profit of $272,826.<span>� </span>The individual gross profits ranged from
over $11,000 per trade to nearly $74,000.<span>�
</span>Lebed professes that he did nothing wrong � he did nothing different
from Wall Street analysts.<span>� </span>He states
that he learned how people react to the stock market and acted on that
knowledge.<span>� </span>According to Lebed�s
friends, even Lebed�s teachers would follow his advice regarding the stock
market.<span>� </span>While one of Lebed�s friends
lost a significant amount of money on one of the trades Lebed pushed, he states
�[i]n the stock market, you go in knowing you can lose.<span>� </span>We were just doing what Jon was doing, but not
doing as good a job at it.�<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[2]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a></p>

<p>Depending on who
you talk to, Lebed was either viewed as a person who knowingly abused the
system and broke the law, or someone who acted no differently than Wall Street
analysts acted and was able to use the system to his advantage, actually
performing no wrong-doing.<span>� </span>Lebed�s own
father stated on 60 Minutes that he was proud of his son and that he hadn�t
done anything wrong.<span>� </span>This belief can
also be evinced by the fact that after Lebed�s first meeting with the SEC,
while his mother closed the Ameritrade account, Lebed�s father opened an
E*Trade account so that Lebed could continue to trade stocks.<span>� </span>The SEC, however, stated that Lebed violated
Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the
Exchange Act.<span>� </span>These Acts �prohibit
acts, transactions, practices or course of business that operate as a fraud or
deceit in connection with the offer, purchase or sale of securities, including
misrepresentation and omissions of material fact.�<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[3]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a><span>� </span>The SEC therefore ordered Lebed pay his fine
and to �cease and desist� from causing any further violation of Section 17(a).</p>

<p>Even the news
articles that covered Lebed�s actions appear split on whether he had done
anything wrong.<span>� </span>While an article
written by Peter Carbonara for Money Magazine<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[4]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a>
appears to favor the SEC decision (albeit wondering why the SEC let Lebed keep
the remaining $500,000 of profit), Michael Lewis, writing for New York Times
Magazine,<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[5]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a>
acknowledges that there were victims who suffered from Lebed�s actions, yet asserts
that the SEC only settled because they believed they would not be able to win
in court, and that its evidence was not as strong as it had alleged. </p>

    <p> An 18-year-old from near Ottawa has become what appears to be the first Canadian, and among the youngest people in the world, to have a rare but extraordinary super memory.</p> <p> Emily Nash learned she has highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM) after being tested by researchers in the U.S.</p> <p> She now jokingly calls it her “superpower,” relieved to learn that the trait she tried to hide was actually a verifiable phenomenon.</p> <p> “I just felt so much relief knowing that I'm not alone, that it's not something I made up. It's something that actually exists,” she told CTV W5 in an exclusive interview.</p> <ul>  <li> <strong><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/w5">Watch the latest W5 investigations</a></strong></li> </ul> <p> Emily is a straight-A student. In her last year of high school, she is decidedly composed and modest about her skill. But she now joins a small and unique tribe of about 100 people confirmed with HSAM around the world.</p> <p> For most of us, memories fade with time.</p> <p> Ask anyone to tell you what happened on Oct. 21, 2021 and you will usually be met with a lengthy pause as they struggle to recall events of that day.</p> <p> But ask Emily and the response comes within seconds, with precision. “October 21, 2021? Oh, the Alec Baldwin ‘Rust’ shooting. That was a Thursday,” she quickly responded.</p> <p> March 4, 2019? “Luke Perry died,” she stated, noting she never watched the actor’s show, but rather just heard about his passing. “ My mom took me home for lunch, and I remember in the car we had the radio on and they said Luke Perry passed away.” That is all it took for her to remember this detail four-and-a-half years later.</p> <p> <img src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/3/23/emily-nash--ctv-w5-1-6819460-1711199260433.jpeg" alt=""><span>Emily Nash said her memories are filed in a mental calendar, in video form (CTV W5) </span></p> <p> Emily said her memories are filed in a mental calendar, in video form. “Each day kind of represents a little movie, where I can rewind and fast forward and replay various points throughout my day,” she said.</p> <p> Her parents, Jason Nash and Julie Farnworth, said they spotted Emily’s uncanny recall as a young child.</p> <p> Her father, Jason, said he would show Emily a series of coloured bowling pins for about 10 seconds and then spin her around, asking her to name the order they were in.</p> <p> “She would knock them off right away in terms of identifying every pin, in terms of, you know, red, yellow, green, blue,” he said.</p> <p> Her mother, Julie, discovered Emily -- at age five -- could watch a Peanuts cartoon and then recall and repeat the dialogue from any point in the episode.</p> <p> “We knew that at that point in time there was something going on with her memory, but we couldn't quite pinpoint what it was like. So we thought we should just let it develop a little more naturally on its own to try and figure out what it is,” Julie said.</p> <p> They finally figured it out, coincidentally, on Remembrance Day 2021.</p> <ul>  <li> <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/app"><strong>The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App</strong></a></li> </ul> <ul>  <li> <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters"><strong>Sign up for breaking news alerts from CTV News, right at your fingertips</strong></a></li> </ul> <p> As Julie was designing a tombstone for her parents, she was asked by the headstone designer for specific dates of their births and marriage. Julie joked that she would contact “Wikipedia” -- the family pet name for Emily -- who rapidly texted back all the correct dates.</p> <p> That’s when the headstone designer suggested Emily might have the same sort of unusual memory first documented in a "60 Minutes" program from 2010, featuring American actress Marilu Henner. The Broadway star and main character of the 1970s sitcom “Taxi” revealed she has a super autobiographical memory for dates and events.</p> <p> “It was a jaw-dropping moment when I realized the similarities," said Julie, after watching the documentary program. That's when the pointed questions to their daughter began.</p> <p> “We said, ‘well, can you name the day of the week? Can you go back, you know, a year and tell us exactly what you did on that date? You know, what were you wearing? What did you eat?’ She was able to explain all those things,” said Jason. For Emily, it was validation that she wasn’t, as she puts, it “weird.”</p> <p> “Knowing that other people have it in the world, I just felt so much relief knowing that I'm not alone,” she said.</p> <p> <img src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/3/23/emily-nash-was-formally-tested-by-scientists-1-6819462-1711199410329.jpg" alt=""><span>Emily Nash was formally tested by scientists at Northwestern University in Chicago, and by Carmen Westerberg, a psychology and sleep researcher at Texas State University (CTV W5).</span></p> <p> Emily was then formally tested by scientists at Northwestern University in Chicago, and by Carmen Westerberg, a psychology and sleep researcher at Texas State University. The test usually involves giving someone random dates, asking them to specify the day of the week, personal experiences, along with verifiable events around that time.</p> <p> But because Emily is among the youngest the team had assessed, they had to adjust the screening questions to adapt to the life experiences of a teen.</p> <p> “That was one thing that stuck out," said Westerberg. Any time we asked her a pop culture question, she was all over it, but she didn't have as much knowledge about world events.”</p> <p> CTV W5 was able to film a sample test, where Emily was asked about a variety of dates, starting with Nov. 26, 2021.</p> <p> “That was a Friday,” said Emily.</p> <p> “Do you recall a verifiable event from around that time?” asked Westerberg.</p> <p> “Let's see,” said Emily, who then amazingly rattled off a comprehensive list.</p> <p> “A Netflix film called ‘Tick, Tick Boom’ was released on Nov. 10th, 2021.</p> <p> “’The House of Gucci,’ released Nov. 24th, 2021.</p> <p> “’West Side Story’ -- that came in theaters Dec. 3rd, I'm pretty sure, 2021,” she said.</p> <p> She was 100 percent correct.</p> <p> When Emily was asked if she wanted researchers to help understand HSAM to see if it might unlock clues to help those with memory loss, she didn’t hesitate. She lives with the memory of watching two of her grandparents suffer because of dementia. “ I want to help in the best way possible with my memory,” said Emily.</p> <h2> Super memory as a way of tackling memory loss</h2> <p> Scientists only began studying HSAM in 2006. They have confirmed it’s not related to IQ and that those with superior memory don’t use tricks to remember. It is found more often in people with obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD), though in Emily’s case her mother confirms her only obsession is her school work.</p> <p> The most intriguing discovery of people with HSAM, say scientists, is that their memories don’t decay like the vast majority of people. “They're not really taking in more information. It's just that they are not forgetting it like most people do.” said Westerberg.</p> <p> In a world where there are an estimated 10 million people a year developing memory loss linked to dementia and Alzheimers, HSAM is a “juicy phenomenon,” according to Giuliana Mazzoni, a researcher at the University of Rome.</p> <p> Mazzoni is studying the phenomenon in a group of Italians with HSAM because of the intriguing lessons they may hold. Westerberg agrees, saying, “If we can figure out what's going right with memory, maybe we can help with what's going wrong.”</p> <p> Mazzoni is among a group of scientists who are trying to identify the regions of the brain that appear more active in those with highly superior autobiographical memory. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010945219300887?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">Her early work </a>suggested more grey matter in parts of the brain along with a higher emphasis on visual recording of daily events.</p> <p> There are also tests starting to apply what’s being learned. A group of patients with early Alzheimer’s disease are receiving transcranial magnetic stimulation, targeting the circuit identified in HSAM as part of a trial at the University of Perugia and University of Trento. The question: will the signals improve patients memory?</p> <p> <img src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/3/23/the-experiment-is-led-by-prof--costanza-papagno-1-6819455-1711198823110.jpeg" alt=""><span>The experiment is led by Prof. Costanza Papagno, professor of neurology at the University of Trento (Photo courtesy of Costanza Papagno)</span></p> <h2> Emily’s sleep</h2> <p> The study that Emily has signed up for has her putting on her pajamas.</p> <p> In a sleep laboratory in the basement of a building on the campus of Texas State University, in Austin, a technician glues sensors to her head and chest for an overnight sleep study. It’s all in the name of dementia research.</p> <p> Sleep is where scientists believe memories are cemented into the brain.</p> <p> Westerberg and colleagues at Northwestern University in Chicago have been probing how sleep might help those with superior autobiographical memory. The team is about halfway through a study comparing 12 adults with HSAM against 24 normal controls. Emily is patient number nine.</p> <p> Both groups, says Westerberg, sleep about the same total time. But those with HSAM differ in one important area -- sleep spindles.</p> <ul>  <li> <strong><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech">Top science and technology headlines, all in one place</a></strong></li> </ul> <p> On an electroencephalogram (EEG), the test used to track brain waves during sleep, spindles look like random, tiny, jagged lines along the otherwise smooth brain signals of early sleep. But this pattern is how some scientists think our brains synchronize memories and deposit them for future use.</p> <p> As Westerberg compares the results, she says she is finding people with HSAM have more sleep spindles, almost double, than people with normal memory, along with an unusual pattern with the early slow ways of sleep. She calls it “exciting.”</p> <p> “This is suggesting that maybe they are consolidating their memories of what happened to them during the day more strongly or more efficiently than other people, which could help explain why they're not forgetting as much,” Westerberg said.</p> <p> Her study will be completed later in 2024, but it does raise some tantalizing possibilities.</p> <p> People with cognitive decline and dementia have often troubled sleep and, interestingly, disrupted or abnormal <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32853916/" target="_blank">sleep spindles</a> and slow wave phase sleep patterns. So could helping restore normal sleep and those spindles improve their memories? Westerberg points to studies that show some sleep medications have been shown to increase spindles, and slow wave sleep.</p> <p> “By getting better sleep and, in particular, you know, these slow oscillations linked with the sleep spindles…maybe that could improve memory,” she said.</p> <h2> The road forward for a girl who can’t forget</h2> <p> As soon as Emily returned from testing in Austin, she began to receive acceptance from every university program to which she applied. Her plan is a career in scientific research.</p> <p> “I'm thinking either like biomedical science, biotechnology,” she said.</p> <p> Emily has another shorter term goal. That is to meet others with this “gift.” While HSAM has its benefits, there is a serious drawback. Those with superior memory remember the good, but they will also never forget the bad. They feel the pain as if it were today. Some with HSAM struggle with anxiety and depression as a result.</p> <p> While Emily hasn’t yet suffered much rejection or loss, she’s felt the sting of the past hurts. “It's like I just re-lived them 5 minutes ago. So it can be difficult for me to push through,” said Emily.</p> <p> That’s why Julie, a psychiatric nurse, is putting great effort into coaching her daughter on how to manage that burden.</p> <p> “I've tried to teach her that everybody has heartbreak. That is part of life,” said Julie. “There will be breakups, and she has to expect that, and it's part of our growth.”</p> <p> But it worries Julie. “I won't lie. Sometimes it does keep me up at night thinking,....how will it be for her? I don't think any of us can quite conceptualize what it will be like for her” she said.</p> <ul>  <li> <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters"><strong>5 Things to Know newsletter: Sign up to start your day with the top stories</strong></a></li> </ul> <p> Markie Pasternak said she can understand Emily’s situation, perfectly.</p> <p> The 29-year-old from Minneapolis discovered she had HSAM while sitting in a university class, discussing the power of memory and posting blogs on her website, <a href="https://livingwithtotalrecall.home.blog/" target="_blank">Living with Total Recall</a>.</p> <p> Pasternak has met three others with HSAM. Emily is her fourth.</p> <p> “I think it's courageous. I think it's courageous to take that step, to admit that you have this,” said Pasternak of Emily’s decision to go public. They chatted for about half-an-hour by Zoom as Emily, clearly happy to meet someone from her unusual tribe, asked a raft of questions.</p> <p> “How does your memory work? Like, mine's like a calendar,” she said.</p> <p> Markie described hers as more of a board game. “Each day is different, like square and like, they're different colors, and it kind of zig zags around. It's almost like I can go forward and backwards,” she said.</p> <p> “Do you let people know that you have HSAM or do you wait until it's brought up?” asked Emily.</p> <p> “With friendships and acquaintances and stuff or work, even, I just wait until it comes up, and it usually does,” responded Markie, warning that there is a vulnerability to allowing people to ask her to pull up memories. Some may bring happiness, others, sharp pain.</p> <p> “It’s like my most precious gem, my like, most … sacred thing to me,” said Markie, describing her memories. “And I'm going to open up to you and you can ask me any day in my life and I'm going to tell you what I did that day.”</p> <p> Another question: “Does your brain ever stop thinking? Or is your brain just flying with memories like 24-7?” asked Emily.</p> <p> “My default was always just reminiscing, nostalgia,” said Markie, who added she copes by journaling. “I've learned to compartmentalize (and) have worked on my own mental health, too, and my own personal boundaries with that,” she said.</p> <p> The most important advice she offered Emily is that if you can’t forget, you need to cultivate forgiveness.</p> <p> “Everyone gets hurt by other people at some point because we're all human. And most people, again, they have their forgetfulness to kind of ease that and move on,” said Markie. “We don't have that. And so we have to rely so hard on the virtue of forgiveness and recognizing that people are human and they make mistakes.”</p> <h2> Think you have HSAM? Test it out</h2> <p> While there are only about 100-200 verified cases of HSAM in the world, scientists suspect there are many more.</p> <p> Prof. Valerio Santangelo, a professor of cognitive psychology at the University of Perugia in Italy, has calculated that theoretically 0.01 per cent of the population could have a highly superior autobiographical memory. That could mean 700,000 people around the world who fit the criteria but have not been formally tested.</p> <p> Part of this may be because there have been few scientists studying this form of memory, and has to be culturally and age appropriate. In Emily’s case, researchers at Northwestern University and The University of Texas, Austin, had to make questions appropriate for an 18-year-old who prefers movies and music to world affairs.</p> <p> While there is no online screening tool, Dr. James McGaugh, a now retired professor emeritus at the <a href="https://cnlm.uci.edu/" target="_blank">Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory</a> at the University of California, Irvine, who helped discover HSAM, told CTV’s W5 that people can start with their own screening test.</p> <p> They begin by selecting well-known events and asking the person for the date and the day of the week when the event occurred.</p> <p> They can also randomly select a day or date, and ask for verifiable events around that date.</p> <p> He added that “it is critically important to emphasize that HSAM is a strong ability to recall autobiographical experiences, along with the day and dates.” In creating questions, the advice is to use events that are noteworthy and that occurred after the test subject was about 15 years old.</p> <p> <strong>For example: </strong></p> <p> <em>Day and Date of Super Bowl in 2015?</em></p> <p> Answer: Feb. 1.</p> <p> <em>Day and Date of Canadian Thanksgiving in 2017?</em></p> <p> Answer: Monday, Oct. 9, 2017.</p> <p> Or you can ask, <em>what event occurred Feb 1, 2015? </em></p> <p> Answer: The Superbowl.</p> <p> Researchers use something called the "10 Date Quiz," using randomly selected dates, picked by an <a href="https://www.random.org/calendar-dates/" target="_blank">online calculator like this one</a>.</p> <p> Test subjects get a point for identifying the event, the day of the week, the month and the year.</p> <p> Individuals were asked to provide three different categories of information for each of the 10 dates generated:</p> <p> (1) the day of the week;</p> <p> (2) a description of a verifiable event that could be confirmed via an online search</p> <p> (3) a description of a personal autobiographical event the individual participated in.</p> <p> That’s a maximum of three possible points per date and 30 total. The percentage scored for each category (date/day/event) as well as the total score, the average of all three categories, was calculated.</p> <p> A total score of 65 per cent indicates that a person is likely to have HSAM and would merit further testing by researchers at a center studying this autobiographical memory.</p> <p> <em>Watch W5's documentary 'Total Recall' in our video player at the top of this article</em></p> <p> <em>With files from producers&nbsp;</em><em>Maya Hamovitch and&nbsp;</em><em>Kevin O'Keefe</em></p>

<p><span><em><span>Background notes about the satellites</span></em></span></p>
<p>The 2024 TSE could be a meteorological challenge.&nbsp; While the <em>Eclipsophile</em> climate studies are useful for long-range planning, they becomes less and less helpful when eclipse day is less than a week away. By late March, 2024, eclipse-day tactics should turn to the regular long- and short-range forecasts available from a number of agencies. On the day before the eclipse, numerical forecasts have lost much of their value and should be augmented by satellite and radar data and by reports from surface weather stations.</p>
<p>Satellites maintain a continuous watch across North America and the satellite of choice for this event is <em>GOES East</em>, located over the equator and streaming images at 5-minute intervals. There are many public and commercial web sites that can do proper justice to the resolution of GOES E imagery, but you will probably appreciate those that show full-colour images.</p>

Note that night has fallen over the Atlantic and eastern seaboard where cloud depictions have a different appearance.</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This eclipse comes in the middle of the day for the most part and so satellite images in visible wavelengths will be available for a few hours before the shadow reaches Mazatlán and for the whole day by the time it reaches Bonavista, Newfoundland. Even so, if you anticipate a long trip to clear skies, you will have to make use of the infrared images, which work at night.</p>
<p>The raw satellite data arrive at receiving stations as gray-scale images in many different wavelengths. Among those wavelengths, the current mix of geostationary satellites collect scenes in red, green, and blue frequencies during the daytime—a mixture that can be combined into a colour image as long as the Sun is up. When the Sun is down, a “pseudo-colour” image can be assembled from a mix of infrared wavelengths that mimics the appearance of daytime clouds (Figure 1). The day and night images merge well together—almost seamlessly—and now many sites offer the combination (GEOCOLOR) on their web sites.</p>
<p>Images from single wavebands are also commonly available, and you may wish to look at some of these, most likely at night if you are confronted by a difficult situation such as overnight fog.</p>
<p>For the most part, images from one Internet site are similar to those from another, but they differ in their interfaces and ability to zoom. The capability to put highways and station reports on top of the satellite image in the College of Dupage site could be valuable in a difficult, fast-changing situation.</p>
<p><em><span>A short primer on numerical models</span></em></p>
<p>Satellite photos are OK for what is happening now, but they are pretty limited in predicting what the weather will do two days in the future.&nbsp; For that information, we need to use computer forecasts (usually referred to as numerical forecasts or model forecasts). There are many types of numerical forecasts,&nbsp; way more than a dozen if you go looking. They are usually models run by countries for their own interests, but they share the code used in the models, so they are not completely independent of each other.</p>
<p><span>Types of models</span></p>
<p>There are two types of models: global long-range ones and regional short-range forecasts. In the U.S., the main long-range model is the GFS (15 days); short-range models are the NAM (84 hours), the RAP (21 hours), and the HRRR (18 hours). Canada contributes the GDPS for long range (15 days), and the RDPS (84 hours).&nbsp; The most commonly used European long-range model is the ECMWF, generally regarded as the most reliable, but it’s a commercial product and you have to look around to get the parts of it you’d like, but it’s readily available on windy.com. There are many more, especially if you chase eclipses somewhere other than North America.</p>
<p>For the most part (but changing rapidly), long-range models have lower resolution than short-range versions. Windy.com displays the model resolutions on their menu page: ECMWF, 9 km; GFS, 22 km; ICON, 13 km; NAM, 5 km; HRRR, 3 km. High resolution doesn’t necessarily mean better, but high-resolution models do update more frequently, essentially updating the forecast. The differences between the models are embedded in the code that runs the models, and so are not visible to you. The internal bits include such things as how cloud cover and precipitation are calculated, so you must expect some substantial differences between models. With luck (?), they will converge on the correct answer as eclipse day approaches.</p>
<p>A special type of numerical forecast is a type called an ensemble model. These show an average of many different model calculations (runs), each one slightly varying the starting parameters. There are several of them available at Pivotal Weather, but only the American GEFS and Canada’s CMCE show cloud cover. The CFS climate model available on Pivotal Weather goes out for 32 days, well past eclipse time, but the day-to-day forecasts are so erratic that they can’t be used for planning. It is designed for long-range climate predictions.</p>
<p>Almost all of the commonly available forecast outputs in North America are models maintained by NOAA’s modelling arm, including those that are presented in your evening news broadcast. Only a few of the largest private companies maintain their own models. For the most part, large commercial companies don’t give you much choice on satellite images or numerical models, but they’ll probably focus on where to watch the eclipse on the days ahead and that professional opinion could be invaluable.</p>
<p><span>How do you handle all of this?</span></p>
<p>Pick two long-range and two short-range models and run with them. I guarantee total confusion if you use more—they are just too variable unless eclipse day is nearby.</p>
<p>Commercial sites usually only show you “their” model, as they don’t want to imply that there is some uncertainty in the future they foresee. In many cases, their model is the National Weather Service model with some fancy graphics attached.</p>
<p><span>Don’t rely on models until eclipse day is around the corner</span></p>
<p>A word of caution: models aren’t really very good until about a week ahead of an event, and should improve steadily as the moment approaches. You might use the NAM and the RDPS for the two-three days ahead of the eclipse and the long-range models before. Once the models start to look like each other, with similar cloud patterns and precipitation amounts and when successive model runs keep the same forecast, you can begin to trust them. There will always be differences between them, but even that will tell you where things are uncertain and help you decide whether you might want to move to a spot where they all agree about good weather.</p>
<p>When eclipse day arrives and the weather at your site is looking iffy, the local weather channel or a satellite image may be all that you need. For the most part, it concentrates on what’s happening now and what will happen in the next few hours. That may be all you need. In the end, preparation and mobility will be important contributors to your success.</p>
<p>Good luck on eclipse day. Don’t forget to watch the shadow go by in the satellite images afterward.</p>

            Humans have many wonderful qualities, but we lack something that’s a common feature among most animals with backbones: a tail. Exactly why that is has been something of a mystery.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clu398w7300023b6hza04r7i1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Tails are useful for balance, propulsion, communication and defense against biting insects. However, humans and our closest primate relatives — the great apes — said farewell to tails about 25 million years ago, when the group split from Old World monkeys. The loss has long been associated with our transition to bipedalism, but little was known about the genetic factors that triggered primate taillessness.
    </p>

            Now, scientists have traced our tail loss to a short sequence of genetic code that is abundant in our genome but had been dismissed for decades as junk DNA, a sequence that seemingly serves no biological purpose. They identified the snippet, known as an Alu element, in the regulatory code of a gene associated with tail length called TBXT. Alu is also part of a class known as jumping genes, which are genetic sequences capable of switching their location in the genome and triggering or undoing mutations.

            At some point in our distant past, the Alu element AluY jumped into the TBXT gene in the ancestor of hominoids (great apes and humans). When scientists compared the DNA of six hominoid species and 15 non-hominoid primates, they found AluY only in hominoid genomes, the scientists reported February 28 in the journal <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07095-8" target="_blank">Nature</a>. And in experiments with genetically modified mice — a process that took roughly four years — tinkering with Alu insertions in the rodents’ TBXT genes resulted in variable tail lengths.

            Prior to this study “there were many hypotheses about why hominoids evolved to be tailless,” the most common of which connected taillessness to upright posture and the evolution of bipedal walking, said lead study author <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/boxia/home" target="_blank">Bo Xia</a>, a research fellow in the Gene Regulation Observatory and principal investigator at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University.

            But as for identifying precisely how humans and great apes lost their tails, “there was (previously) nothing discovered or hypothesized,” Xia told CNN in an email. “Our discovery is the first time to propose a genetic mechanism,” he said.

            And because tails are an extension of the spine, the findings could also have implications for understanding malformations of the neural tube that can occur during human fetal development, according to the study.

            A breakthrough moment for the researchers came when Xia was reviewing the TBXT region of the genome in an online database that’s widely used by developmental biologists, said study coauthor <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/itai-yanai" target="_blank">Itai Yanai</a>, a professor with the Institute for Systems Genetics and Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine.

            “It must have been something that thousands of other geneticists looked at,” Yanai told CNN. “That’s incredible, right? That everybody is looking at the same thing, and Bo noticed something they all didn’t.”

            Alu elements are abundant in human DNA; the insertion in TBXT is “literally one out of a million that we have in our genome,” Yanai said. But while most researchers had dismissed TBXT’s Alu insertion as junk DNA, Xia noticed its proximity to a neighboring Alu element. He suspected that if they paired up, it could trigger a process disrupting protein production in the TBXT gene.

They found that Alu made the TBXT gene produce two kinds of proteins. One of those led to shorter tails; the more of that protein the genes&nbsp;produced, the shorter the tails.

            “While we understand how they replicate in the genome, we now are forced to think about how they’re also shaping very important aspects of physiology, of morphology, of development,” he said. “I think it’s astounding that one Alu element — one small, little thing — can lead to the loss of a whole appendage like the tail.”

            Humans still have tails when we’re developing in the womb as embryos; this wee appendage is a hand-me-down from the tailed ancestor of all vertebrates and includes 10 to 12 vertebrae. It’s only visible from the fifth to sixth week of gestation, and by the fetus’ eighth week its tail is usually gone. Some babies retain an embryonic remnant of a tail, but this is extremely rare and such tails typically lack bone and cartilage and are not part of the spinal cord, another team of researchers <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3263034/#:~:text=A%20%E2%80%9Cvestigial%20tail%E2%80%9D%20describes%20a,weeks%2C%20the%20human%20tail%20disappears" target="_blank">reported</a> in 2012.

            But while the new study explains the “how” of tail loss in humans and great apes, the “why” of it is still an open question, said biological anthropologist <a href="http://sites.utexas.edu/lizashapiro/" target="_blank">Liza Shapiro</a>, a professor in the&nbsp;department of&nbsp;anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin.

            “I think it’s really interesting to pinpoint a genetic mechanism that might have been responsible for loss of the tail in hominoids, and this paper makes&nbsp;a valuable contribution that way,” Shapiro, who was not involved in the research, told CNN in an email.

            “However, if this was a mutation that randomly led to tail loss in our ape ancestors, it still begs the question as to whether or not the mutation was maintained because it was functionally beneficial (an evolutionary adaptation), or just not a hindrance,” said Shapiro, who investigates how primates move and the role of the spine in primate locomotion.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clu31mp47001o3b6i0bid7m4t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            By the time ancient primates began walking on two legs, they had already lost their tails. The oldest members of the hominid lineage are the early apes Proconsul and Ekembo (found in Kenya and dating to 21 million years ago and 18 million years ago, respectively). Fossils show that though these ancient primates were tailless, they were tree-dwellers that walked on four limbs with a horizontal body posture like monkeys, Shapiro said.

            “So the tail was lost first, and then the locomotion we associate with living apes evolved subsequently,” Shapiro said. “But it does not help us understand why the tail was lost in the first place.”
    </p>

            The notion that upright walking and tail loss were functionally linked, with tail muscles being repurposed as pelvic floor muscles, “is an old idea that is NOT consistent with the fossil record,” she added.

            “Evolution works from what is already there, so I wouldn’t say that loss of the tail helps us understand the evolution of human bipedalism in any direct way. It helps us understand our ape ancestry, though,” she said.

            For modern humans, tails are a distant genetic memory. But the tale of our tails is far from over, and there is still much about tail loss for scientists to explore, Xia said.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clu3aplqv00033b6hwcdl674h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Future research could investigate other consequences of the Alu element in TBXT, such as impacts on human embryonic development and behavior, he suggested. Though the absence of a tail is the most visible result of the Alu insertion, it’s possible that the gene’s presence also triggered other developmental shifts — as well as changes to locomotion and related behaviors in early hominoids — to accommodate tail loss.
    </p>

    <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clu31mp47001u3b6iwd3fbmpe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
            Additional genes probably played a part in tail loss, too. While Alu’s role “seems to be a very important one,”&nbsp;other genetic factors likely contributed to the permanent disappearance of our primate ancestors’ tails,” Xia said.
    </p>

            “It’s reasonable to think that during that time, there were many more mutations related to stabilizing the loss of the tail,” Yanai said. And because such evolutionary change is complex, our tails are gone for good, he added. Even if the driving mutation identified in the study could be undone, “it still wouldn’t bring back the tail.”

            The new findings may also shed light on a type of neural tube defect in embryos known as spina bifida. In their experiments, the researchers found that when mice were genetically engineered for tail loss, some developed neural tube deformities that resembled spina bifida in humans.

            “Maybe the reason why we have this condition in humans is because of this trade-off that our ancestors made 25 million years ago to lose their tails,” Yanai said. “Now that we made this connection to this particular genetic element and this particularly important gene, it could open up doors in studying neurological defects.”

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Today’s post will take us in a slightly different direction than the last few. Today’s post will be about hooking up some Python code to the X-Plane flight simulator to enable development of an autopilot using PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controllers. I’ve been a fan of flight simulators for quite some time (I distinctly remember getting <a href="https://archive.org/details/msflightsimulator98" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 98</a> for my birthday when I was like 8 or 9) but have only recently started working with interfacing them to code. X-Plane is a well-known flight simulator developed by another Austin – <a href="https://austinmeyer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Austin Meyer</a>. It is regarded as having one of the best flight models and has tons of options for getting data into/out of the simulator. More than one FAA-certified simulator setups are running X-Plane as the primary driver software.</p>
<p>I got started thinking about writing some code for X-Plane while playing another game, Factorio. I drive a little plane or car in the game to get around my base and I just added a plug-in that “snaps” the vehicle to a heading, which makes it easier to go in straight lines. I thought – “hmm how hard could this be to duplicate in a flight sim?”. So here we are.</p>
<p>This post will get X-Plane hooked up to Python. The real programming will start with the <a href="https://austinsnerdythings.com/2021/10/19/coding-a-wing-leveler-autopilot-in-x-plane-with-python/">next post</a>.</p>
<p>Most recent post (added 2024-03-24) – <a href="https://austinsnerdythings.com/2024/03/24/adding-some-polish-to-the-x-plane-python-autopilot-with-flask-redis-and-websockets/">Adding some polish to the X-Plane Python Autopilot with Flask, Redis, and WebSockets</a></p>
<h2>Video Link</h2>
<figure></figure>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download and install X-Plane (I used X-Plane 10 because it uses less resources than X-Plane 11 and we don’t need the graphics/scenery to look super pretty to do coding. It also loads faster.)</li>
<li>Download and install NASA’s XPlaneConnect X-Plane plug-in to X-Plane</li>
<li>Verify the XPlaneConnect plug-in is active in X-Plane</li>
<li>Download sample code from XPlaneConnect’s GitHub page</li>
<li>Run the sample script to verify data is being transmitted from X-Plane via UDP to the XPlaneConnect code</li>
</ol>
<h3>1 – Download and install X-Plane 10 or X-Plane 11</h3>
<p>I’ll leave this one up to you. X-Plane 10 is hard to find these days I just discovered. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/269950/XPlane_11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">X-Plane 11 is available on Steam</a> for $59.99 as of writing. I just tested and the plug-in/code works fine on X-Plane 11 (but the flight models are definitely different and will need different PID values). My screenshots might jump between the two versions but the content/message will be the same.</p>
<h3>2 – Download and install NASA’s XPlaneConnect plug-in</h3>
<p>NASA (yes, that NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has wrote a bunch of code to interface with X-Plane. They have adapters for C, C++, Java, Matlab, and Python. They work with X-Plane 9, 10, and 11.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the latest version from the <a href="https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/releases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XPlaneConnect GitHub releases page</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/releases/download/v1.3-rc6/XPlaneConnect.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.3 RC6</a> as of writing</li>
<li>Open the .zip and place the contents in the [X-Plane directory]/Resources/plugins folder. There are few other folders already present in this directory. Mine looked like this after adding the XPlaneConnect folder:</li>

<h3>3 – Verify XPlaneConnect is active in X-Plane</h3>
<p>Now we’ll load up X-Plane and check the plug-ins to verify XPlaneConnect is enabled. Go to the top menu and select Plugins -&gt; Plugin Admin. You should see X-Plane Connect checked in the enabled column:</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/tree/master/Python3/src" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Python3 portion of the GitHub code</a>, download <a href="https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/blob/master/Python3/src/xpc.py" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">xpc.py</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/blob/master/Python3/src/monitorExample.py" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monitorExample.py</a> and stick them in your working directory (doesn’t matter where). For me, I just downloaded the entire git structure so the code is at C:\Users\Austin\source\repos\XPlaneConnect\Python3\src:</p>

<h3>5 – Run sample code to verify data is making it from X-Plane to our code</h3>
<p>With X-Plane running with a plane on a runway (or anywhere really), go ahead and run monitorExample.py! I will be using Visual Studio Code to program this XPlane Python autopilot stuff so that’s where I’ll run it from.</p>
<p>You will start seeing lines scroll by very fast with 6 pieces of information – latitude, longitude, elevation (in meters), and the control deflections for aileron, elevator, and rudder (normalized from -1 to 1, with 0 being centered). In the below screenshot, we see a lat/lon of 39.915, -105.128, with an elevation of 1719m. First one to tell me in the comments what runway that is wins internet points!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post, we have successfully downloaded the XPlaneConnect plug-in, and demonstrated that it can successfully interface with Python code in both X-Plane 10 and X-Plane 11.</p>
<p>Next up is to start controlling the plane with a basic wing leveler. As of writing this post, I have the following completely functional:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pitch / roll hold at reasonable angles (-25 to 25)</li>
<li>Altitude set and hold</li>
<li>Heading set and hold</li>
<li>Airspeed set and hold</li>
<li>Navigate directly to a lat/lon point</li>
</ul>
<p>See you at the next post! Next post – <a href="https://austinsnerdythings.com/2021/10/19/coding-a-wing-leveler-autopilot-in-x-plane-with-python/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coding a wing leveler autopilot in X-Plane with Python</a></p>
