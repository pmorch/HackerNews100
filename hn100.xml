        Dear Orbit User,
        </p><p>
        I trust this email finds you well amidst the cacophony of technological marvels that continue to dazzle us mere mortals. Ah, but let us take a moment to bask in the radiant glow of Artificial Intelligence, that wondrous creation that promises to revolutionize our existence like nothing before! Oh, the sheer joy of living in an era where machines possess the intellect to outsmart us at every turn!
        </p><p>
        Let's delve into the enchanting world of AI, shall we? Brace yourself for a journey through the lands of algorithmic superiority and the utopia of automation.
        </p><p>
        Firstly, let's celebrate the ingenuity of AI in its remarkable ability to render even the simplest of tasks utterly complex. Why settle for straightforward solutions when you can bask in the glory of convoluted algorithms and endless parameter tweaking? Oh, the sheer delight of spending countless hours trying to figure out why your AI model insists on classifying your cat as a dog!
        </p><p>
        And let's not forget the unparalleled joy of witnessing AI's prowess in predictive analytics. It's simply magical how AI can predict what I want to buy, watch, or do next based on my previous actions. Who needs free will anyway when we have algorithms to dictate our every move?
        </p><p>
        Oh, and let's raise a toast to the magnificence of AI chatbots! Gone are the days of meaningful human interaction. Why engage in genuine conversation when you can spend eternity navigating through a maze of pre-programmed responses that barely scratch the surface of comprehension?
        </p><p>
        But wait, there's more! Let us not overlook the awe-inspiring advancements in AI-generated content. Why bother with the creative process when you can feed a machine a bunch of data and watch it regurgitate something vaguely resembling art? Who needs human expression when you have neural networks spewing out poetry like a malfunctioning printer?
        </p><p>
        And last but certainly not least, let us bow down to the unquestionable wisdom of AI in matters of ethics and morality. After all, what could possibly go wrong when we entrust the fate of humanity to machines whose decision-making processes are as opaque as a black hole?
        </p><p>
        In conclusion, let us revel in the glory of Artificial Intelligence, that shining beacon of innovation and progress. For in a world where humans are mere puppets in the hands of algorithms, what could possibly be more exhilarating than surrendering our autonomy to the cold embrace of silicon supremacy?
        </p><p>
        Yet, amid the complexity and occasional absurdity, there’s something undeniably fascinating about our ongoing dance with technology. Here’s to embracing the quirks and wonders of AI, and to finding joy in the process—even when it means occasionally laughing at our own reflections in the digital mirror.
        </p><p>
        Sincerely,
        <br>
        Your Annoying Friend/Boss/Neighbor

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Why China Is Building a Thorium Molten-Salt Reactor"><p><strong>After a half-century hiatus,</strong> thorium has returned to the front lines of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nuclear-power">nuclear power</a> research as a source of fuel. In 2025, China plans to start building a demonstration thorium-based molten-salt reactor in the Gobi Desert.
</p><p>
	The 10-megawatt reactor project, managed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ 
	<a href="http://english.sinap.cas.cn/about_sinap/brief_introduction/" target="_blank">Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics (SINAP)</a>, is scheduled to be operational by 2030, according to an <a href="https://www.sinap.ac.cn/upload/%E5%85%AC%E7%A4%BA/%E9%99%84%E4%BB%B62%EF%BC%9A%E3%80%8A%E5%B0%8F%E5%9E%8B%E6%A8%A1%E5%9D%97%E5%8C%96%E9%92%8D%E5%9F%BA%E7%86%94%E7%9B%90%E5%A0%86%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E8%AE%BE%E6%96%BD%E7%8E%AF%E5%A2%83%E5%BD%B1%E5%93%8D%E6%8A%A5%E5%91%8A%E4%B9%A6%EF%BC%88%E9%80%89%E5%9D%80%E9%98%B6%E6%AE%B5%EF%BC%89%E3%80%8B.html" target="_blank">environmental-impact report</a> released by the Academy in October. The project follows a 2-MW experimental version <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/china-closing-in-on-thorium-nuclear-reactor" target="_blank">completed</a> in 2021 and operated since then.
</p><p>
	China’s efforts put it at the forefront of both thorium-based fuel breeding and molten-salt reactors. Several companies elsewhere in the world are developing plans for this kind of fuel or reactor, but none has yet operated one. Prior to China’s pilot project, the last operating molten-salt reactor was Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s 
	<a href="https://www.ornl.gov/molten-salt-reactor/history" target="_blank">Molten Salt Reactor Experiment</a>, which ran on uranium. It shut down in 1969.
</p><p>
	Thorium-232, found in igneous rocks and heavy mineral sands, is more 
	<a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/thoriums-long-term-potential-in-nuclear-energy-new-iaea-analysis" target="_blank">abundant</a> on Earth than the commonly used isotope in nuclear fuel, uranium-235. But this weakly radioactive metal isn’t directly fissile–it can’t undergo fission, the splitting of atomic nuclei that produces energy. So it must first be transformed into fissile uranium-233. That’s technically feasible, but whether it’s economical and practical is less clear.
</p><h2>China’s Thorium-Reactor Advances</h2><p>
	The attraction of thorium is that it can help achieve energy self-sufficiency by reducing dependence on uranium, particularly for countries such as India with 
	<a href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/thorium" target="_blank">enormous thorium reserves</a>. But China may source it in a different way: The element is a waste product of China’s huge rare earth mining industry. Harnessing it would provide a practically inexhaustible supply of fuel. Already, China’s Gansu province has <a href="https://gxt.gansu.gov.cn/gxt/c107558/202408/173963630/files/ce6c98eaf82d442fb750f54d41f13d9b.pdf" target="_blank">maritime and aerospace applications</a> in mind for this future energy supply, <a href="http://www.gs.xinhua.org/20240901/64bd03444b384514b43c38a9f63038d4/c.html" target="_blank">according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency</a>.
</p><p>Scant technical details of China’s reactor exist, and SINAP didn’t respond to <em><em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</a></em></em>’s requests for information. The Chinese Academy of Sciences’ environmental-impact report states that the molten-salt reactor core will be 3 meters in height and 2.8 meters in diameter. It will operate at 700 °C and have a thermal output of 60 MW, along with 10 MW of electricity.</p><p><span>Molten-salt breeder reactors are the most viable designs for thorium fuel, says 
	</span><a href="https://web.mit.edu/nse/people/research/forsberg.html" target="_blank">Charles Forsberg</a><span>, a nuclear scientist at MIT. In this kind of reactor, thorium fluoride dissolves in molten salt in the reactor’s core. To turn thorium-232 into fuel, it is irradiated to thorium-233, which decays into an intermediate, protactinium-233, and then into uranium-233, which is fissile. During this fuel-breeding process, protactinium is removed from the reactor core while it decays, and then it is returned to the core as uranium-233. Fission occurs, generating heat and then steam, which drives a turbine to generate electricity.</span></p><p>
	But many challenges come along with thorium use. A big one is dealing with the risk of proliferation. When thorium is transformed into uranium-233, it becomes 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/is-thorium-the-nuclear-fuel-of-the-future" target="_blank">directly usable in nuclear weapons</a>. “It’s of a quality comparable to separated plutonium and is thus very dangerous,” says <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/about/people/edwin-lyman" target="_blank">Edwin Lyman</a>, director of nuclear power safety at the <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/" target="_blank">Union of Concerned Scientists</a> in Washington, D.C. If the fuel is circulating in and out of the reactor core during operation, this movement introduces routes for the theft of uranium-233, he says.
</p><h2>Thorium Fuel Charms Nuclear-Power Sector</h2><p>
	Most groups developing molten-salt reactors are focused on uranium or uranium mixtures as a fuel, at least in the short term. 
	<a href="https://www.naturaresources.com/" target="_blank">Natura Resources</a> and <a href="https://acu.edu/" target="_blank">Abilene Christian University</a>, both in Abilene, Texas, are collaborating on a 1-MW liquid-molten-salt reactor after <a href="https://acu.edu/2024/09/23/nrc-issues-construction-permit-for-natura-resources-molten-salt-reactor-at-acu-2/" target="_blank">receiving a construction permit</a> in September from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Kairos Power is developing a fluoride-salt-cooled, high-temperature reactor in Oak Ridge, Tenn., that will use uranium-based <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/triso-particles-most-robust-nuclear-fuel-earth" target="_blank">tri-structural isotropic (TRISO)</a> particle fuel. The company in October <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-powered-data-center" target="_blank">inked a deal with Google</a> to provide a total of 500 MW by 2035 to power its data centers.
</p><p>
	But China isn’t alone in its thorium aspirations. Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, in addition to 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/qa-thorium-reactor-designer-ratan-kumar-sinha" target="_blank">India</a>, have shown interest in the fuel at one point or another. The proliferation issue doesn’t seem to be a showstopper, and there are ways to mitigate the risk. Denmark’s <a href="https://www.copenhagenatomics.com/" target="_blank">Copenhagen Atomics</a>, for example, currently aims to develop a thorium-based molten-salt reactor, with a 1-MW pilot planned for 2026. The company plans to <a href="https://www.copenhagenatomics.com/technology/" target="_blank">weld it shut</a> so that would-be thieves would have to break open a highly radioactive system to get at the weapon-ready material. Chicago-based <a href="https://cleancore.energy/" target="_blank">Clean Core Thorium Energy</a> developed a blended thorium and enriched uranium (including <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-power-plant-2666199640" target="_blank">high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU</a>) fuel, which they say can’t be used in a weapon. The fuel is designed for heavy-water reactors.
</p><p>
	Political and technical hurdles may have largely sidelined thorium fuel and molten-salt-reactor research for the last five decades, but both are definitely back on the drawing table.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Defending his livelihood, Neumayer started asking questions. At first, that led to his videos being reinstated. But that victory was short-lived, as the supposed Nintendo lawyer only escalated his demands, spooking the YouTuber into voluntarily removing some videos, The Verge reported, while continuing to investigate the potential troll.</p>
<h2>Reaching out directly to Nintendo helped, but questions remain</h2>
<p>The Verge has all the receipts, sharing emails from the fake lawyer and detailing Neumayer's fight blow-for-blow. Neumayer ultimately found that there was a patent lawyer with a similar name working for Nintendo in Japan, although he could not tell if that was the person sending the demands and Nintendo would not confirm to The Verge if Tatsumi Masaaki exists.</p>
<p>Only after contacting Nintendo directly did Neumayer finally get some information he could work with to challenge the takedowns. Reportedly, Nintendo replied, telling Neumayer that the fake lawyer's proton email address "is not a legitimate Nintendo email address and the details contained within the communication do not align with Nintendo of America Inc.’s enforcement practices."</p>
<p>Nintendo promised to investigate further, as Neumayer continued to receive demands from the fake lawyer. It took about a week after Nintendo's response for "Tatsumi" to start to stand down, writing in a stunted email to Neumayer, "I hereby retract all of my preceding claims." But even then, the troll went down fighting, The Verge reported.</p>
<p>The final messages from "Tatsumi" claimed that he'd only been suspended from filing claims and threatened that other Nintendo lawyers would be re-filing them. He then sent what The Verge described as "in some ways the most legit-looking email yet," using a publicly available web tool to spoof an official Nintendo email address while continuing to menace Neumayer.</p>
<p>It was that spoofed email that finally ended the façade, though, The Verge reported. Neumayer detected the spoof by checking the headers and IDing the tool used.</p>
<p>Although this case of copyright trolling is seemingly over, Neumayer—along with a couple other gamers trolled by "Tatsumi"—remain frustrated with YouTube, The Verge reported. After his fight with the fake Nintendo lawyer, Neumayer wants the streaming platform to update its policies and make it easier for YouTubers to defend against copyright abuse.</p>
<p>Back in May, when Ars reported on a YouTuber dismayed by a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/washing-machine-chime-scandal-shows-how-absurd-youtube-copyright-abuse-can-get/">DMCA takedown over a washing machine chime</a> heard on his video, a YouTube researcher and director of policy and advocacy for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Katharine Trendacosta told Ars that YouTube's current process discourages YouTubers from disputing copyright strikes.</p>
<p>“Every idiot can strike every YouTuber and there is nearly no problem to do so. It’s insane,” Neumayer said. “It has to change NOW.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">In a New Orleans courtroom one afternoon this April, three federal appeals court judges questioned a lawyer for the country’s largest health insurance company.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">They wanted to know why United Healthcare had denied coverage for a 15-year-old girl named Emily Dwyer, whose anorexia had taken such a toll on her body that she had arrived at a residential treatment facility wearing her 8-year-old sister’s jeans.</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">The company’s lawyer explained that United’s denial came after three separate psychiatrists working on behalf of the insurer concluded that Dwyer was no longer engaging in concerning behaviors — not over-exercising and not struggling as much at meals. As a result, United’s doctors agreed that, after five months, she didn’t need the additional treatment at the facility that her own doctors said was essential.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">The judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t appear to buy it. Judge Andrew Oldham said he didn’t understand how the insurance company’s lawyer could stand by a defense that “seems to be not true.”</p>
        
    
                    
            
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0">“The record is teeming, teeming with concerning behaviors,” a frustrated Oldham said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">Oldham, according to a recording of the hearing, ticked off a list. Dwyer, he said, compulsively checked her body. She altered her gait so that her thighs didn’t touch as she walked. And during a three-day weekend meant to see how she would do away from the facility, she lost a couple of the hard-earned pounds she had gained while in treatment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">“How in the world can you say, ‘Oh, well, that’s not a problem’?” Oldham, who had been named to the appeals court by President Donald Trump, asked at the hearing. United’s approach, the judge said, essentially boiled down to “We’ll just gamble with her life.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">Many Americans have faced the denial of mental health treatment by their insurance companies — at times despite vivid evidence of the risk such decisions pose. In most cases, patients don’t appeal. But in a tiny percentage, patients and their families decide to fight the denials in federal court, setting up a David-versus-Goliath battle where insurers frequently have the upper hand.</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">The cases, ProPublica found, expose in blunt terms how insurance companies can put their clients’ health in jeopardy, in ways that some judges have ruled “arbitrary and capricious.” To do so, court records reveal, the insurers have turned to a coterie of psychiatrists and have continued relying on them even after one or more of their decisions have been criticized or overturned in court.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">In their rulings, judges have found that insurers, in part through their psychiatrists, have acted in ways that are “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/cp-v-united-healthcare-ins-co">puzzling</a>,” “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/ian-c-v-unitedhealthcare-ins-co">disingenuous</a>” and even “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/m-s-v-premera-blue-cross">dishonest</a>.” The companies have engaged in “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/dominic-w-ex-rel-sofia-w-v-n-tr-co-emp-welfare-benefit-plan">selective readings</a>” of the medical evidence, “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/dk-v-united-behavioral-health-3">shut their eyes</a>” to medical opinions that opposed their conclusions and made “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/anne-a-v-united-healthcare-ins-co-2">baseless arguments</a>” in court. Doctors reviewing the same cases have even repeated <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-9th-circuit/1675891.html">nearly identical language</a> in denial letters, casting “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/dominic-w-ex-rel-sofia-w-v-n-tr-co-emp-welfare-benefit-plan">significant doubt</a>” on whether they’re independent.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0">Some doctors made critical errors, contradicted by the very records they claimed they reviewed, according to thousands of pages of court documents, interviews and insurance records. Ruling after ruling reveals how they failed to meaningfully engage with patients’ families or medical providers or to adequately explain their decisions.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">And when insurers have faced pushback over why they’re denying treatment, they have sometimes abandoned one rationale and shifted to other grounds to deny coverage.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">In dozens of court cases, ProPublica found, judges ruled that insurance companies had violated a federal law meant to protect people who get health insurance through their jobs. The companies in several cases also broke a provision in <a href="https://www.cms.gov/marketplace/private-health-insurance/mental-health-parity-addiction-equity">the law</a> designed to end discrimination between coverage of mental health and medical claims. As a federal judge <a href="https://casetext.com/case/kd-v-anthem-blue-cross?sort=relevance&amp;resultsNav=false&amp;q=">wrote</a> of one company last year, the insurer was “applying separate and unequal treatment limitations” to mental health patients.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">The U.S. Department of Labor, which regulates health insurance plans for about 136 million Americans, is responsible for making sure that insurance companies are loyal to the patients, not just to the company’s bottom line.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">Grant Vaught, a spokesperson for the federal agency, said it has opened “some investigations into the conduct of the individual doctors and psychiatrists employed by insurers,” but declined to specify an exact number. One case resulted in the removal of a doctor and the review organization they worked for. Vaught did not elaborate on whether physicians in any other cases faced professional repercussions. Agency officials said they don’t have the budget or staff to adequately police insurers. Despite <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/reports">repeated</a> <a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/general/budget/2025/CBJ-2025-V2-01.pdf%20">requests</a> to Congress for more funding and stronger enforcement tools, the agency has not received much of what it asked for.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">ProPublica reached out to six insurance companies that court records show have continued to rely on doctors who, judges found, wrongly recommended denying mental health coverage. The doctors aren’t named as parties in the lawsuits, but their decisions are included in complaints, exhibits and judgments. None of the insurers responded to questions about whether they take those repeated cases into account — by, say, refraining from using those doctors — or whether there’s a need for reform.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0">Optum — the United unit responsible for mental health — and the other insurance companies said they employ licensed physicians to conduct reviews. An Optum spokesperson said the company requires its doctors to undergo testing each year to make sure they are issuing appropriate coverage decisions, and the company conducts regular audits of doctors’ decisions.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">“Our priority is ensuring the people we serve receive safe and effective care for their individual needs,” the spokesperson said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">These denials, which frequently come when patients are in the thick of treatment, can have grave consequences. Patients have <a href="https://calmatters.org/health/mental-health/2024/10/mental-health-parity-addiction-treatment/">relapsed</a> into alcohol or drug use, become violent or <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mental-illness-health-care-insurance-60-minutes/">died</a> after prematurely leaving mental health facilities.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">To keep Emily in treatment, the Dwyers would have to burn through their savings and refinance the mortgage on their home in Austin, Texas. They also wrote to the insurance company, hoping to persuade it to continue paying, but United wouldn’t budge.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0">Her parents came to suspect that the company had broken the law. But if they wanted to prove it, they’d have to go to court. </p>

<h3>A “Striking Lack of Care”</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.1">Taking on United wasn’t going to be easy.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">Dwyer’s first denial had come in June 2015, after her treatment team couldn’t convince a United staff psychiatrist that she was critically ill. At the time, Dwyer’s body image was distorted and she constantly shook her legs to burn calories. Her red blood count, hemoglobin levels and blood pressure were all low.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">Dwyer still suffered from many of the same symptoms when, about one month later, United tapped another company doctor for an additional review, as insurers often do. By then, her family had already reluctantly agreed to move her down from residential treatment to partial hospitalization, but had to pay about $350 a day for costs the insurance company would not cover.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0">Then, the insurer denied even partial hospitalization.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">The Dwyers didn’t give up, and the facility filed an appeal. For that review, United turned to Prest &amp; Associates, a firm that health insurers hire to review cases like Dwyer’s. The firm referred the case to psychiatrist Dr. Barbara Center.</p>

    <p>We’re trying something new. <a href="https://iteratehq.com/propublica/670eabefffb484af7dc7db86">Was it helpful?</a></p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">Dwyer’s psychologist, her primary care provider and the Austin doctor who diagnosed her eating disorder got on the phone with Center and described the disastrous weekend away from the facility, according to court records. During that weekend, while Dwyer was shopping with her mom, she broke down in tears when she saw her reflection in a dressing room mirror. Her doctors pleaded with United to continue covering her treatment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0">But Center recommended that United uphold the denial.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">Center specialized in child and adolescent psychiatry after graduating from medical school. She joined Prest &amp; Associates as a reviewer in 2000 and within five years was promoted to chief medical officer of the company, according to her resume. She is licensed as a doctor in at least 20 states. In some cases, her reviews took place early on in the process and were a jumping-off point for other doctors; in others, she served as the final word. In a 2016 sworn deposition, Center said that she earned a base salary, plus additional pay contingent on productivity, or the time it takes her to review a case.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0">In the 15 years before the Dwyers’ April hearing in the federal appeals court, Center’s recommendations were referenced in at least 12 lawsuits around the country that alleged insurers had wrongly denied insurance coverage to patients who needed intensive mental health care. Four of those lawsuits ended in rulings in favor of the insurer, in which judges found that Center’s denial “<a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/19-16775/19-16775-2020-12-02.html">was not deficient</a>,” as alleged; the insurers’ “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/dailey-v-blue-cross-blue-shield-of-kan-city?q=%22Dr.%20Barbara%20Center%22&amp;sort=relevance&amp;p=1&amp;type=case">decisions were reasonable and appropriate</a>”; and the plan “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/potter-v-blue-shield-of-cal-life-health-ins-co?q=%22Dr.%20Barbara%20Center%22&amp;sort=relevance&amp;p=1&amp;type=case">correctly denied benefits</a>.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">Out of the other eight cases ProPublica identified, four ended in confidential settlements with no admission of wrongdoing by the insurers, one in a partial judgment in favor of the insurer and a partial settlement, and three in judgments finding the insurance company had improperly denied coverage, one of which was appealed and then settled.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0">The most <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-9th-circuit/1675891.html">critical of those rulings</a> came in 2014, the year before Center reviewed Dwyer’s appeal. Center was assigned to assess the case of a 43-year-old woman with an eating disorder, severe depression and suicidal thoughts. A United doctor had already recommended denying a request for the woman to remain at a California hospital.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">Center wrote that the woman was not suicidal when, her medical records showed, she was actively planning to either overdose or starve herself to death. Center also incorrectly listed her weight, a key detail given her anorexia. And she undercounted the number of laxatives the woman was taking, saying she took 75 to 100 a day when the treatment notes repeatedly said 130.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0">The case made it all the way up to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where, in a unanimous opinion, the judges wrote that “Center’s ‘independent’ evaluation and coverage decision were based on obvious factual errors.” The court wrote that a third doctor quoted nearly verbatim from Center’s erroneous report. The judges concluded there was a “striking lack of care” by all three psychiatrists.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">The Labor Department filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case, one of only <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/amicus-briefs">15</a> it filed that year related to the federal employee benefits law, that said Center’s case summary “contained errors on practically every aspect” of the woman’s condition and treatment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0">Timothy Hauser, then an associate solicitor at the Labor Department, was one of the attorneys who signed the brief. In an interview with ProPublica, he called the facts of the 9th Circuit case “quite disturbing.” He said the agency has tried to address the issue of doctors whose denials repeatedly appear in lawsuits by filing amicus briefs and updating regulations. The agency spokesperson said the department cannot comment on specific investigations into doctors, including Center.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0">But with just a few hundred investigators and nearly 4 million benefit plans, Hauser said the agency is “necessarily selective in opening investigations” that could lead to fines or penalties. The department also has no legal authority over insurers’ hiring or personnel decisions. Insurers, he stressed, have a responsibility when it comes to the doctors they hire.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">Lisa Kantor, the lawyer who represented the hospital in the 9th Circuit case, said that after reading the appeals court’s ruling, she assumed insurance companies would stop working with Center.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">“I really thought after that decision, which was quite a while ago, I’d never see her name again,” Kantor said. But less than a year later, a new client sent her a denial letter citing Center’s review.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">Over the next decade, United and other insurance companies across the country hired Center even as her recommendations to deny continued <a href="https://casetext.com/case/ll-v-anthem-blue-cross-life-1">to</a> <a href="https://casetext.com/case/sibley-v-priority-health-1">be</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l7QBE_KxiM">singled out</a> <a href="https://casetext.com/case/dwyer-v-united-healthcare-ins-co">in court cases</a>.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0">When Center sat for the sworn deposition in 2016, she acknowledged that she had not reviewed the patient’s full medical records when deciding to deny coverage. Center said she generally reviews only the information sent to her by the insurance company that hires her; in this case, she said the insurer had not sent her the patient’s complete records.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0">Determining a doctor’s denial rate is difficult because it’s not publicly tracked. ProPublica obtained data from a company representing more than 100 facilities in their appeals with insurance companies. While the data is not necessarily representative of the thousands of other mental health facilities across the country, it provides a small window into Center’s work. According to an analysis of this data, Center’s rate for recommending denials over the last three years was about 90%, compared with an overall rate of about 55%.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">Center declined to comment. <a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/25471656-prest-response/?embed=1">But in a statement</a>, a Prest &amp; Associates spokesperson said that Center is committed to providing the highest standards of service. The spokesperson added that the firm “reviews complex, nuanced behavioral health cases” at the request of insurance providers using “standardized guidelines identified by the insurance provider.” The reviewers consider medical records, case notes and, when requested by the insurers, interviews with patient providers, but a patient’s full records are not typically made available to them.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">The firm, the spokesperson said, provides advisory opinions on whether treatment is medically necessary but does not usually decide whether to terminate coverage. In the vast majority of cases, that’s done by the insurer.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">“Prest and its licensed healthcare professionals have not been sued in relation to their medical necessity review work,” the spokesperson said. “No Prest reviewer — including Dr. Center — has been sued for wrongfully denying coverage, as Prest is not responsible for benefit determinations.” And as a contractor, the spokesperson said, the company isn’t “privy to information related to litigation involving cases reviewed by Prest.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0">The spokesperson for United’s mental health arm, Optum, did not respond to specific questions about Dwyer’s lawsuit or Center. </p>

<h3>Not Considered the Practice of Medicine</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0">Having the weight of an MD behind a decision can be powerful, but lawyers and judges who’ve handled these sorts of cases say it can be misleading. Although doctors ultimately determine whether to cut off insurance coverage for a particular treatment, those decisions are generally not considered the practice of medicine and therefore cannot be challenged in a malpractice lawsuit. The doctors advising insurance companies can’t be individually sued on medical grounds, even if something goes wrong after the denial. As a result, their names are cited in lawsuits filed against the insurers, but they are not defendants in suits brought by people denied insurance.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="56.0">Four lawyers who spoke to ProPublica said seeing the same insurance company doctors come up in case after case signaled that they may be improperly denying coverage, though the lawyers stressed that the doctors work within a system designed by the insurers. They said each case must be examined individually to assess whether, or to what degree, a psychiatrist erred.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0">“There are certain lists of doctors that are repeat players. We see them over and over,” said Brian King, a Utah attorney who sues insurers for wrongfully denying mental health claims. “When we see those reviewers, it makes us more skeptical about whether a full and fair review has been provided.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.0">King said many of his cases end in settlements — with confidentiality clauses that prevent the parties from disclosing the terms — in large part because families want to avoid the uncertainty of going to court and a process that often lasts several years. Residential treatment can cost families well into six figures; based on his experience, King said families who settle can expect to recover at least half of what they paid.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0">For lawyers as well as families, identifying doctors and their denial histories is challenging given a lack of public information. That leaves lawsuits as one of the few windows into their work records.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0">“That information is probably the best we have, but it’s patently inadequate,” said D. Brian Hufford, a New York lawyer who focuses on health insurance class-action suits.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.1">In addition, multiple doctors typically weigh in on the same case during its different stages. Some denial letters don’t even list the doctors’ names.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0">To identify some doctors whose denials are repeatedly cited, ProPublica examined insurance letters and interviewed dozens of lawyers, mental health providers and reviewers. A national company that conducts appeals on behalf of mental health facilities also shared internal data tracking appeal calls with insurers. ProPublica then ran the doctors’ names through legal databases and reviewed each lawsuit.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="62.0">One of those doctors was Cigna’s Dr. Mohsin Qayyum, whose coverage recommendations have been cited in at least 17 lawsuits that allege wrongful denial of coverage by the insurer. Eleven of the 17 ended in settlements, in which Cigna denied allegations of wrongdoing. Judges ruled in Cigna’s favor in four cases, though two of those were appealed and then settled. One case was partially ruled in favor of Cigna and partially settled. And one ended in a judgment against Cigna.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.0">In one of the two cases where judges ruled in Cigna’s favor without a settlement, a judge wrote that the reviewing physicians — including Qayyum — “<a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/sites/ca10/files/opinions/01019505777.pdf">acted reasonably and in good faith</a>.” In the other, the judge wrote that while the record paints a picture of the patient as “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/chipman-v-cigna-behavioral-health">troubled and in need of mental health treatment</a>,” the court could not say that Cigna’s decision not to cover treatment was unreasonable “given the deferential standard this Court must apply.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="64.0">In the case where a judge ruled against Cigna, Qayyum had upheld the denial of coverage for a teenage boy with depression, substance use disorder and high anxiety. The judge wrote that the company’s denials failed to engage with the information and assessments that the patient’s providers had submitted. She also found that the denial letter misstated the level of care the patient was actually seeking. As a result, the company acted “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/sh-v-cigna-health-life-ins-co">arbitrarily and capriciously</a>,” a key legal threshold in these cases.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="65.0">In an email, Qayyum wrote that he is not a named party in any of the 17 lawsuits and stressed that settlements do not mean he or Cigna improperly denied a requested service. He said his approval rates are “in line” with his peers’, though he would not say what those rates are. “As a board-certified psychiatrist for 26 years, I am proud of the work I do every day, as both a clinician in my private practice, and a medical director at Cigna,” Qayyum wrote.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="66.0">A Cigna spokesperson said its doctors “are committed to improving the health of patients.” If a denial is ultimately overturned, the spokesperson said that the company’s clinical leaders “use it as a learning opportunity” and meet with the doctor to review cases. The spokesperson said the company provides mentorship and coaching opportunities, requires its doctors to attend case studies and expects them to “perform a thorough and independent review of the services being requested.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="67.0">The spokesperson added that the company is concerned that ProPublica’s reporting on lawsuits, “some dating back nearly a decade … is designed to paint a deeply biased picture of medical directors in our industry.” The spokesperson also said the company’s “approach to behavioral health access and treatment has evolved substantially as the landscape and the clinical evidence has evolved.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="68.0">Insurers have tried to defend against lawsuits by pointing out that multiple doctors all reached the decision to deny coverage. But judges have criticized doctors for rubber-stamping denials and for “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/hr-v-united-healthcare-ins-co-1">multiple levels of deficient arbitrary and capricious determinations</a>.” Just last year, a judge wrote that “<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.utd.112460/gov.uscourts.utd.112460.96.0_1.pdf">three deficient denials considered together does not amount to substantial evidence to save any one of them</a>.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="69.0">In interviews with ProPublica, federal judges criticized a system that fails to address problems that arise in court case after court case. They faulted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which governs many insurance claims in court, for not allowing for punitive damages, the sort that can rise into the millions of dollars and deter companies from bad conduct.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="70.0">To one federal judge, who like others spoke about cases on condition of anonymity, doctors and the insurance companies they work for essentially get off scot-free. “They might have to pay 10 claims,” the judge said, “but if they can avoid paying a thousand claims, then why would they change anything?”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="71.0">In the summer of 2023, United’s decision-making led one federal judge in Utah to quote Alice from the famed “Through the Looking-Glass.” The insurer had reversed course on why it was denying coverage for a 13-year-old boy with autism. United first said that the facility where the boy was being treated wasn’t a licensed residential treatment center. It was. Then the company said the facility primarily offered educational services. It didn’t.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="72.0">United’s argument, Judge Bruce Jenkins <a href="https://casetext.com/case/cp-v-united-healthcare-ins-co">wrote</a>, called to mind Alice asking “whether you can make words mean so many different things.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="72.1">He went on to write that it sometimes appears the insurer’s only duty is to “preserve the plan’s financial assets rather than offering aid to the plan’s human assets (its members and beneficiaries).”</p>

<h3>An Uphill Battle</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="73.0">For years, Emily Dwyer hid her eating disorder from her family. She found ways to flush food down the toilet or convince her parents that she was going for a walk when she was actually retrieving sneakers she had stashed in the neighbor’s hedges and exhausting herself on hourlong runs.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.0">At 5’2”, she was not to be underestimated. The oldest of four girls, she excelled at almost everything. Straight A’s in her liberal arts and science magnet school. A lively friend group. Medals in cross-country. Experts have found that many anorexia patients are high achievers who set nearly impossible standards for themselves. That was the case for Dwyer, who said her extreme drive included succeeding at her eating disorder.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="75.0">By January 2015, her parents pulled her out of school. They could finally see through the lies she was telling them about having already eaten at school or needing to stay through dinner to work on a project. If she ate at all, it would take her hours to get through a meal. When her family was sleeping, she would wake up at 3 a.m. to secretly exercise in her bedroom.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.0">They took her to Dr. Ed Tyson, who specializes in eating disorders and who diagnosed Dwyer with anorexia. He told her parents she was in danger and desperately needed residential treatment. He made it clear that the treatment would be successful only if she completed it.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="77.0">In February, when the Dwyers made the trip from Austin to an eating disorder treatment center near the mountains of Utah, Emily weighed 75 pounds. Records show her body mass index, which compares someone’s weight relative to their height, was dangerously low at 13.9. She was lethargic and hollow-eyed.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="78.0">As her father, Kelly, drove from the airport to the facility, he caught sight of his daughter in the rearview mirror with her head in her mother Allison’s lap. He knew that she wouldn’t survive without the treatment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="79.0">The team at the facility placed Dwyer on a 4,000-calorie-a-day diet and 24-hour monitoring. In addition to the anorexia, her doctors diagnosed her with anxiety, depression and severe malnutrition. She refused to engage with her therapists.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="81.0">“I was not willing to think deeply or be reflective of anything,” Dwyer said in a recent interview. “I was very angry.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="82.0">When United issued its denial after five months, saying she was ready for intensive outpatient treatment, her parents knew she wasn’t. They consulted Tyson, who emphasized that releasing their daughter prematurely would increase the likelihood of her needing residential treatment again and could put her health at grave risk.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="83.0">“Emily was still struggling, so it would be difficult to get all the food that she would need,” Tyson said in an interview with ProPublica. “Pretty soon the other physical parameters would start to go south. The red blood cells, the white blood cells. The heart muscle gets smaller. The muscle itself becomes weaker, so when it pumps, it can’t pump as hard.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="85.0">For Kelly Dwyer, a lawyer who counsels clients on mergers and acquisitions, facing the prospect of releasing her too early was too much to bear. He couldn’t imagine putting Emily back in a facility if she relapsed. The first time, when she clung to him in those final moments, it was the hardest thing he’d ever had to do.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="86.0">“I never, ever wanted to do it again,” he said. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="86.1">Without so much as a whisper to their daughter, they filled out the paperwork to refinance their mortgage.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="87.0">In 2017, nearly two years after the initial denial, the Dwyers sued United for wrongfully denying coverage. In 2019, a federal district judge held a trial that lasted about 90 minutes, but it took him nearly four years to issue a decision. He ruled in favor of United. The Dwyers appealed.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="88.0">“Talk about delayed justice,” said the Dwyers’ lawyer, Elizabeth Green, who previously worked at Kantor’s firm, which took the case on contingency, meaning without any guarantees that it would get paid. Most lawyers in these kinds of cases take them on a contingency basis.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="89.0">The federal appeals court — just one level below the U.S. Supreme Court — didn’t take nearly so long to issue a ruling. In September, about five months after hearing the case, the three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision and ruled unanimously in favor of the Dwyers. The judges, led by Oldham, dissected the denial letters issued by the three doctors and found they were “not supported by the underlying medical evidence.” In fact, the judges wrote, they were “contradicted by the record.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="90.0">When United denied Emily Dwyer’s coverage, the judges wrote, “she was still very ill.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="91.0">Judges have repeatedly warned insurance companies that they cannot ignore the opinions of the doctors who are actually treating the patients. What’s more, they must explain how they engaged with them. As in many cases examined by ProPublica, the psychiatrists reviewing Dwyer’s treatment used boilerplate language in their denial letters and failed to provide or offer a sufficient explanation.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="92.0">“We therefore join a growing number of decisions rejecting similar denial letters issued by United across the country,” Oldham and his fellow judges wrote.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="93.0">The Dwyers recognize the privilege that allowed them to pay for their daughter’s continued treatment without knowing if or when they’d get their money back. They also understood how to navigate the legal system. Their goal, in addition to getting reimbursed, was to make it harder for insurance companies to kick children out of treatment when they need it.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="94.0">For their daughter, the extra seven weeks made all the difference. That time, Emily said in an interview, forced her to confront her eating disorder and get comfortable in her new body. She had gained more than half of what she weighed when she arrived in Utah, but she made a point of avoiding knowing her weight. She developed deep connections with the other girls in the program and witnessed them battle the same compulsions.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="95.0">Toward the end of her time there, she even mentored new patients and earned a key to the bathroom, one of the final steps before going home.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="97.0">No insurance company doctor, Dwyer said, could understand her situation in a quick call to her doctors — even if she had reached her target weight.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="97.1">“You can’t just make this decision, wipe your hands and leave work for the day,” she said. “Your actions have real consequences.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="98.0">When the Dwyers learned from ProPublica that Center had rejected their appeal about a year after a judge had issued the blistering opinion against her in a different case, her denial stung even more. It was maddening to hear that she has been involved in multiple lawsuits that have been settled or where a judge found the insurer wrongfully denied coverage.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="99.0">“There is no accountability,” Allison Dwyer said.</p>

<h3>A New Beginning</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="99.1">Of all the girls Emily Dwyer met while in treatment, most relapsed or needed to be readmitted to a residential facility. </p>

Her first year back was filled with doctor and therapy appointments.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-457486">

				


				


				<h3>from the <i>same-old-stuff-only-much-more-expensive</i> dept</h3>
				


				<p>Evolv might be new to the game but it’s already made a name for itself. And not a good one. </p>
<p>It was an integral part of New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ ongoing run of public failures. The mayor announced Evolv would be <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/08/05/nyc-proudly-announces-rollout-of-gun-detecting-tech-even-tech-producer-says-wont-reliably-detect-guns/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/08/05/nyc-proudly-announces-rollout-of-gun-detecting-tech-even-tech-producer-says-wont-reliably-detect-guns/">placing its “gun detection” tech</a> in the city’s subways, despite the public admission of Evolv CEO Peter George (during a call with investors) that the tech wouldn’t work all that well in subways. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Subways, in particular, are not a place that we think is a good use case for us,” George said, due to the “interference with the railways.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He probably meant interference <em>from</em> the railways, but the end result of <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/05/15/gun-detection-tech-co-this-wont-work-in-subways-nyc-mayor-were-putting-it-in-the-subways/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/05/15/gun-detection-tech-co-this-wont-work-in-subways-nyc-mayor-were-putting-it-in-the-subways/">Evolv’s trial run</a> could probably be described as “interference <em>with</em> the railways” <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/10/30/gun-detection-tech-the-gun-detection-tech-firm-said-wouldnt-work-in-nyc-subways-doesnt-work-in-nyc-subways/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/10/30/gun-detection-tech-the-gun-detection-tech-firm-said-wouldnt-work-in-nyc-subways-doesnt-work-in-nyc-subways/">just as accurately</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A pilot program testing&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/nyc-subway-gun-scanners-fb22efbc2a5fd56b02fd6b2d95d75255">AI-powered weapons scanners</a>&nbsp;inside some New York City subway stations this summer did not detect any passengers with firearms — but&nbsp;<strong>falsely alerted more than 100 times</strong>, according to newly released police data.</em></p>
<p><em>Through nearly 3,000 searches, the scanners turned up more than 118 false positives as well as 12 knives, police said, though they declined to say whether the positive hits referred to illegal blades or tools, such as pocket knives, that are allowed in the transit system.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On one hand, CEO Peter George definitely didn’t oversell the tech’s effectiveness when he expressed his reluctance to deploy it in city subways. On the other hand, it would appear Evolv’s sales force has overstated the tech’s effectiveness so often, the Federal Trade Commission has been forced to step in. Here’s more from <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/12/ftc-rightfully-acts-against-so-called-ai-weapon-detection-company-evolv" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/12/ftc-rightfully-acts-against-so-called-ai-weapon-detection-company-evolv">Matthew Guariglia and Cooper Quintin of the EFF</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Federal Trade Commission has entered a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/EVOLVORDERFILED.pdf">settlement</a>&nbsp;with self-styled “weapon detection” company Evolv, to resolve the FTC’s claim that the company&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/EVOLVCOMPLAINTFILED.pdf">“knowingly” and repeatedly” engaged in “unlawful” acts</a>&nbsp;of misleading claims about their technology. Essentially, Evolv’s technology, which is in schools, subways, and stadiums, does far less than they’ve been claiming.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/EVOLVCOMPLAINTFILED.pdf">The FTC alleged in their complaint</a>&nbsp;that despite the lofty claims made by Evolv, the technology is fundamentally no different from a metal detector: “The company has insisted publicly and repeatedly that Express is a ‘weapons detection’ system and not a ‘metal detector.’ This representation is solely a marketing distinction, in that <strong>the only things that Express scanners detect are metallic and its alarms can be set off by metallic objects that are not weapons</strong>.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evolv is selling metal detectors with some unproven AI stapled to them. Because there’s AI involved, the company has no qualms about selling its metal detectors for up to five times the going rate of regular, non-AI-tainted metal detectors. If customers balk at the markup, that’s where the salespeople step in to, apparently, overstate the accuracy of Evolv’s tech and its presumed effectiveness in reducing violent crime by detecting weapons. </p>
<p>Here’s what the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25468828-ftc-evolv/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25468828-ftc-evolv/">settlement</a> [PDF] prevents Evolv from making representations about in its marketing materials, advertising, or anything connected with pitching its products to potential customers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A. the ability to detect weapons;<br>B. the ability to ignore harmless personal items;<br>C. the ability to detect weapons while ignoring harmless personal items;<br>D. the ability to ignore harmless personal items without requiring visitors to remove any such items from pockets or bags;<br>E. weapons detection accuracy, including in comparison to the use of metal detectors;<br>F. false alarm rates, including comparisons to the use of metal detectors;<br>G. the speed at which visitors can be screened, as compared to the use of metal detectors;<br>H. labor costs, including comparisons to the use of metal detectors;<br>I. testing, or the results of any testing; or<br>J. any material aspect of its performance, efficacy, nature, or central characteristics, including, but not limited to, the use of algorithms, artificial intelligence, or other automated systems or tools</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow. That’s pretty much everything the company could possibly say about its products, which pretty much means it can only provide customers with makes/model numbers and the price of those offerings. There’s no “pitch” left to be made, which means the company is certainly already working towards having this settlement heavily altered or rescinded on appeal.</p>
<p>It also instructs the company to inform all of its educational facility customers that they can cancel their contracts immediately and pay only what’s owed through the point the contract is cancelled. </p>
<p>The only upside for Evolv is that this settlement only applies to its Evolv Express product and only to its marketing to customers in the educational field. It’s still open season elsewhere, but this settlement contains admissions by the company that it misled these particular customers, which should make other potential customers in other areas (hospitals, subways, etc.) far more wary of trusting Evolv’s effectiveness assertions.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><li><p>SQLite is the most deployed and most used database. There are over one trillion (1000000000000 or a million million) SQLite databases in active use.</p><p>It is maintained by <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/crew.html">three people</a>. They don’t allow outside contributions.</p></li><li><p>SQLite is likely used more than all other database engines combined. Billions and billions of copies of SQLite exist in the wild. It’s everywhere.</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-1.png"></li><li><p>It is also probably one of the top five most deployed software modules.</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-2.png"></li><li><p><a href="https://hwaci.com/">Hwaci</a> is the company behind SQLite. They are also into music(?)</p><p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-3.png"></p></li><li><p>SQLite originated from a US warship. D. Richard Hipp (DRH) was building software for the USS Oscar Austin, a Navy destroyer. The existing software would just stop working whenever the server went down (this was in the 2000s). For a battleship, this was unacceptable.</p><p>So DRH asked the question: what if the database just worked without any server? This was an innovative idea back then.</p></li><li><p>SQLite is not open source in the legal sense, as “open source” has a specific definition and requires licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-4.png"><p>Instead, SQLite is in the public domain, which means it has even fewer restrictions than any open source license.</p></li><li><p>They don’t allow outside contributions. You <em>cannot</em> just send a pull request and hope the patch will be accepted.</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-5.png"></li><li><p>Open Source, Not Open Contribution</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-6.png"><p>Contributing to SQLite is invite-only (I don’t have a source). Only after you are invited and have signed an affidavit dedicating your contribution to the public domain can you submit patches.</p></li><li><p>How do they cook?</p><p>There are over 600 lines of test code for every line of code in SQLite. Tests cover 100% of branches (and 100% <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_condition/decision_coverage">MC/DC</a>) in the library. The test suite is extremely diverse, including fuzz tests, boundary value tests, regression tests, and tests that simulate operating system crashes, power losses, I/O errors, and out-of-memory errors.</p></li><li><p>Interestingly, some SQLite tests are proprietary. The test suite called <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/th3.html">TH3 (Test Harness 3)</a>, which achieves 100% branch coverage of the code, is proprietary and is not open to access.</p><p>I don’t know any other project which has made code free, but test suites are paid.</p><p>However, they could not sell a single copy of TH3. DRH said in a podcast:</p><blockquote><p>The 100% MCD tests, that’s called TH3. That’s proprietary. I had the idea that we would sell those tests to avionics manufacturers and make money that way. We’ve sold exactly zero copies of that so that didn’t really work out.</p></blockquote><p>In order to get access, one needs to be part of SQLite Consortium, which costs $120K/yearly.</p></li><li><p>It’s an interesting business model. They generate revenue through paid support, maintenance services, consortium membership, and commercial extensions.</p></li><li><p>SQLite does not have a Code of Conduct (CoC), rather <a href="https://sqlite.org/codeofethics.html">Code of Ethics</a> derived from “instruments of good works” from chapter 4 of The Rule of St. Benedict</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-coe.png"></li><li><p>In SQLite: In place of a legal notice, here is a <a href="https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/blob/624cb96/src/wal.c#L4,#L9">blessing</a>:</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-11.jpeg"><p>All the of the source code files come with a blessing.</p></li><li><p>SQLite is so fast, they compete with <code>fopen</code>. For some use cases, you can use SQLite instead of a filesystem, that can be 35% faster.</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-7.png"></li><li><p>SQLite vs Redis (guess which is faster?)</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-8.png"><p>For <a href="https://x.com/iavins/status/1849422515027763227">some usecases</a>, the SQLite can be faster than Redis due to network stack and (de)serialisation overhead.</p></li><li><p>But, unlike most databases, SQLite has a single writer model. You cannot have more than one concurrent writer.</p><p>This was also changed recently in 2010 by adding WAL mode. Before that, you could have either readers or a writer, but never together.</p></li><li><p>There are other things which are very common in other databases but not in SQLite:</p><ul><li>The default is rollback journal mode, which restricts you to have either multiple readers or a single writer</li><li>Foreign Keys are disabled; they are opt-in</li><li>It is “weakly typed”. SQLite calls it “type affinity”. Meaning you can insert whatever in a column even though you have defined a type. Strong typed columns are opt-in.</li><li><a href="https://sqlite.org/omitted.html">Many of the <code>ALTER</code> commands</a> you expect in other databases don’t work. For example, you cannot add a contraint to an existing column. (They recently added ability to rename a column name)</li></ul><p>There is a whole <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/quirks.html">list of quirks</a> here.</p></li><li><p>I hate that it doesn’t have types. It’s totally YOLO:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>user</span>(id INTEGER);
</span></span><span><span><span>INSERT</span> <span>into</span> <span>user</span> <span>VALUES</span> (<span>"YOLO!"</span>); <span>--- This works!
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Not only that, it does not throw any error if you give some random type.</p><p><code>CREATE TABLE t(value TIMMYSTAMP);</code></p><p>There is no <code>TIMMYSTAMP</code> type, but SQLite accepts this happily. It has five types: <code>NULL</code>, <code>INTEGER</code>, <code>REAL</code>, <code>TEXT</code>, <code>BLOB</code>. Want to know something cursed? The type affinity works by <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#determination_of_column_affinity">substring match</a>!</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> t(value SPONGEBLOB) <span>--- This is BLOB type!
</span></span></span></code></pre></div></li><li><p>This is one my <a href="https://x.com/iavins/status/1865746403072389612">favorite lore</a>. SQLite had to change the default prefix from <code>sqlite_</code> to <code>etilqs_</code> when users started calling developers in the middle of the night</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-9.png"></li><li><p>SQLite takes backward compatibility very seriously</p><blockquote><p>All releases of SQLite version 3 can read and write database files created by the very first SQLite 3 release (version 3.0.0) going back to 2004-06-18. This is “backwards compatibility”. The developers promise to maintain backwards compatibility of the database file format for all future releases of SQLite 3.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>But they take backward compatibility so seriously that even if they have <a href="https://x.com/iavins/status/1851276312876326980">shipped a bug</a>, they won’t fix it</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-10.png"></li><li><p>SQLite’s author D. Richard Hipp (DRH) did not find existing version control systems suitable. So he wrote his own called <a href="https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/fossil-v-git.wiki">Fossil</a>.

The <code>ts_zip</code> utility can
compress (and hopefully decompress) text files using a Large Language
Model. The compression ratio is much higher than with other
compression tools. There are some caveats of course:
<ul>
  <li>A GPU is necessary to get a reasonable speed. 4 GB of RAM is
    required. </li>
  <li>It is slower than conventional compressors (compression and
    decompression speed: up to 1 MB/s on a RTX 4090).</li>
  <li>Only text files are supported. Binary files won't be compressed
  much. The currently used language model (RWKV 169M v4) was trained
  mostly on English texts. Other languages are supported including
  source code.</li>
  <li>It is experimental so no backward compability should be expected
    between the various versions.</li>
  <li>See also <a href="https://bellard.org/ts_sms">ts_sms</a> which is optimized for the
    compression of small messages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical information</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>ts_zip</code> uses
  the <a href="https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM">RWKV 169M v4</a>
  language model which is a good compromise between speed and
  compression ratio. The model is quantized to 8 bits per parameter
    and evaluated using BF16 floating point numbers.</li>
  <li>The language model predicts the probabilities of the next token. An
    arithmetic coder then encodes the next token according to the
    probabilities.</li>
  <li>The model is evaluated in a deterministic and reproducible
    way. Hence the result does not depend on the exact GPU or CPU
    model nor on the number of configured threads. This key point
    ensures that a compressed file can be decompressed using a
    different hardware or software configuration.</li>

      <p>
        Just in time for holiday tech-support sessions, here's what to know about passkeys.
      </p>

      
    </div>
</header>


  

  
      
    
    <div>
                      
                      
          
<p>It's that time again, when families and friends gather and implore the more technically inclined among them to troubleshoot problems they're having behind the device screens all around them. One of the most vexing and most common problems is logging into accounts in a way that's both secure and reliable.</p>
<p>Using the same password everywhere is easy, but in an age of mass data breaches and precision-orchestrated phishing attacks, it's also highly unadvisable. Then again, creating hundreds of unique passwords, storing them securely, and keeping them out of the hands of phishers and database hackers is hard enough for experts, let alone Uncle Charlie, who got his first smartphone only a few years ago. No wonder this problem never goes away.</p>
<p>Passkeys—the much-talked-about password alternative to passwords that have been widely available for almost two years—was supposed to fix all that. When I wrote about passkeys <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/passwordless-google-accounts-are-easier-and-more-secure-than-passwords-heres-why/">two years ago</a>, I was a big believer. I remain convinced that passkeys mount the steepest hurdle yet for phishers, SIM swappers, database plunderers, and other adversaries trying to hijack accounts. How and why is that?</p>
<h2>Elegant, yes, but usable?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2 specification</a> and the overlapping <a href="https://www.w3.org/press-releases/2019/webauthn/">WebAuthn predecessor</a> that underpin passkeys are nothing short of pure elegance. Unfortunately, as support has become ubiquitous in browsers, operating systems, password managers, and other third-party offerings, the ease and simplicity envisioned have been undone—so much so that they can't be considered usable security, a term I define as a security measure that's as easy, or only incrementally harder, to use as less-secure alternatives.</p>
<p>"There are barriers at each turn that guide you through a developer's idea of how you should use them," William Brown, a software engineer specializing in authentication, wrote in an online interview. "None of them are deal-breaking, but they add up."</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Passkeys are now supported on <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys-directory/">hundreds of sites</a> and roughly a <a href="https://passkeys.dev/device-support/">dozen</a> operating systems and browsers. The diverse ecosystem demonstrates the industry-wide support for passkeys, but it has also fostered a jumble of competing workflows, appearances, and capabilities that can vary greatly depending on the particular site, OS, and browser (or browser agents such as native iOS or Android apps). Rather than help users understand the dizzying number of options and choose the right one, each implementation strong-arms the user into choosing the vendor's preferred choice.</p>
<p>The experience of logging into PayPal with a passkey on Windows will be different from logging into the same site on iOS or even logging into it with Edge on Android. And forget about trying to use a passkey to log into PayPal on Firefox. The payment site doesn't support that browser on any OS.</p>
<p>Another example is when I create a passkey for my LinkedIn account on Firefox. Because I use a wide assortment of browsers on platforms, I have chosen to sync the passkey using my 1Password password manager. In theory, that choice allows me to automatically use this passkey anywhere I have access to my 1Password account, something that isn't possible otherwise. But it's not as simple as all that.</p>
<p>When I look at the passkey in LinkedIn settings, it shows as being created for Firefox on Mac OS X 10, even though it works on all the browsers and OSes I'm using.</p>

</p></div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>Why is LinkedIn indicating otherwise? The answer is that there's no way for LinkedIn to interoperate flexibly with the browsers and OSes and vice versa. Per the FIDO2 and WebAuthn specs, LinkedIn knows only the browser and OS I used when creating the credential. 1Password, meanwhile, has no way to coordinate with LinkedIn to ensure I'm presented with consistent information that will help me keep track of this. Suddenly, using passkeys is more confusing than it needs to be for there to be utility to ordinary users.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Things get more complicated still when I want to log into LinkedIn on Firefox for Android, and am presented with the following dialog box.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img width="1080" height="2400" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/linkedin-passkey-firefox-android.png" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/linkedin-passkey-firefox-android.png 1080w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/linkedin-passkey-firefox-android-640x1422.png 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/linkedin-passkey-firefox-android-1024x2276.png 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/linkedin-passkey-firefox-android-768x1707.png 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/linkedin-passkey-firefox-android-691x1536.png 691w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/linkedin-passkey-firefox-android-922x2048.png 922w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/linkedin-passkey-firefox-android-980x2178.png 980w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px">

    <p>
      Screenshot showing a dialog box with the text: "You're using on-device encryption. Unlock your passwords to sign in."

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>At this point, I don't know if it's Google or Firefox that's presenting me with this non-intuitive response. I just want to open LinkedIn using the passkey that's being synced by 1Password to all my devices. Somehow, the mysterious entity responsible for this message (it's Google in this case) has hijacked the process in an attempt to convince me to use its platform.</p>
<p>Also, consider the experience on <a href="https://webauthn.io/">WebAuthn.io</a>, a site that demonstrates how the standard works under different scenarios. When a user wants to enroll a physical security key to log in on macOS, they receive a dialog that steers them toward using a passkey instead and to sync it through iCloud.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img width="739" height="752" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/webauthn.io-01.png" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/webauthn.io-01.png 739w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/webauthn.io-01-640x651.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px">

          <figcaption>
        <div>
    
    <p>
      Dialog box showing macOS passkeys message.

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>The user just wants to enroll a security key in the form of a USB dongle or smartphone and can be used when logging in on any device. But instead, macOS preempts this task with directions for creating a passkey that will be synced through iCloud. What's the user to do? Maybe click on the "other options" in small text at the very bottom? Let's try and see.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img width="761" height="778" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/webauthn.io-02.png" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/webauthn.io-02.png 761w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/webauthn.io-02-640x654.png 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px">

        <div>
    
    <p>
      The dialog box that appears after clicking "other options."

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>Wait, why is it still offering the option for the passkey to be synced in iCloud, and how does that qualify as "other options"? And why is the most prominent suggestion that the user "continue with Touch ID"? It isn't until selectng "security key" that the user will see that option they wanted all along—to store the credential on a security key. Only after this step—now three clicks in—does the light on a USB security key begin blinking, and the key is finally ready to be enrolled.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

      </figure>

<p>The dueling dialogs in this example are by no means unique to macOS.</p>

<h2>Too many cooks in the kitchen</h2>
<p>"Most try to funnel you into a vendor's sync passkey option, and don't make it clear how you can use other things," Brown noted. "Chrome, Apple, Windows, all try to force you to use their synced passkeys by default, and you have to click through prompts to use alternatives."</p>
<p>Bruce Davie, another software engineer with expertise in authentication, agreed, writing in an <a href="https://systemsapproach.org/2024/10/14/can-passkeys-replace-passwords/">October post</a> that the current implementation of passkeys "seems to have failed the 'make it easy for users' test, which in my view is the whole point of passkeys."</p>
<p>In April, Son Nguyen Kim, the product lead for the free <a href="https://proton.me/pass">Proton Pass</a> password manager, penned a post titled <a href="https://proton.me/blog/big-tech-passkey">Big Tech passkey implementations are a trap</a>. In it, he complained that passkey implementations to date lock users into the platform they created the credential on.</p>
<p>“If you use Google Chrome as your browser on a Mac, it uses the Apple Keychain feature to store your passkeys,” he wrote. "This means you can’t sync your passkeys to your Chrome profile on other devices.” In an email last month, Kim said users can now override this option and choose to store their passkeys in Chrome. Even then, however, "passkeys created on Chrome on Mac don’t sync to Chrome in iPhone, so the user can’t use it seamlessly on Chrome on their iPhone."</p>
<p>Other posts reciting similar complaints are <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/passwords-have-problems-but-passkeys-have-more-95285df9">here</a> and <a href="https://joshcgrossman.com/2024/02/08/one-does-not-simply-implement-passkeys/">here</a>.</p>
<p>In short, there are too many cooks in the kitchen, and each one thinks they know the proper way to make pie.</p>
<p>I have put these and other criticisms to the test over the past four months. I have used them on a true heterogeneous environment that includes a MacBook Air, a Lenovo X1 ThinkPad, an iPhone, and a Pixel running Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari, and on the phones, a large number of apps, including those for LinkedIn, PayPal, eBay, Kayak, Gmail, Amazon, and Uber. My objective has been to understand how well passkey-based authentication works over the long term, particularly for cross-platform users.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>I fully agree that syncing across different platforms is much harder than it should be. So is the messaging provided during the passkey enrollment phase. The dialogs users see are dictated arbitrarily by whatever OS or browser has control at the moment. There's no way for previously made configuration choices to be communicated to tailor dialog boxes and workflow.</p>
<p>Another shortcoming: There's no programming interface for Apple, Google, and Microsoft platforms to directly pass credentials from one to the other. The FIDO2 standard has devised a clever method in an attempt to bridge this gap. It typically involves joining two devices over a secure BLE connection and using a QR code so the already-authenticated device can vouch for the trustworthiness of the other. This process is easy for some people in some cases, but it can quickly become quirky and prone to failure, particularly when fussy devices can't connect over BLE.</p>
<p>In many cases, however, critics overstate the severity of these sorts of problems. These are definitely things that unnecessarily confuse and complicate the use of passkeys. But often, they're one-time events that can be overcome by creating multiple passkeys and bootstrapping them for each device. From then on, these unphishable, unstealable credentials live on both devices, in much the way some users allow credentials for their Gmail or Apple ID to be stored in two or more browsers or password managers for convenience.</p>
<p>More helpful still is using a cross-platform password manager to store and sync passkeys. I have been using 1Password to do just that for a month with no problems to report. Most other name-brand password managers would likely perform as well. In keeping with the FIDO2 spec, these credentials are end-to-end encrypted.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>Halfway house for password managers</h2>
<p>With my 1Password account running on my devices, I had no trouble using a passkey to log into any enrolled site on a device running any browser. The flow was fast and intuitive. In most cases, both iOS and Android had no problem passing the key from 1Password to an app for Uber, Amazon, Gmail, or another site. Signing into phone apps is one of the bigger hassles for me. Passkeys made this process much easier, and it did so while also allowing me the added security of MFA.</p>
<p>This reliance on a password manager, however, largely undermines a key value proposition of passkeys, which has been to provide an entirely new paradigm for authenticating ourselves. Using 1Password to sync a password is almost identical to syncing a passkey, so why bother? Worse still, the majority of people still don't use password managers. I'm a big believer in password managers for the security they offer. Making them a condition for using a passkey would be a travesty.</p>
<p>I'm not the first person to voice this criticism. David Heinemeier Hansson said much the same thing in September.</p>
<p>"The problem with passkeys is that they're essentially a halfway house to a password manager, but tied to a specific platform in ways that aren't obvious to a user at all, and liable to easily leave them unable to access ... their accounts," <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/passwords-have-problems-but-passkeys-have-more-95285df9">wrote</a> the Danish software engineer and programmer, who created Ruby on Rails and is the CTO of web-based software development firm 37signals. "Much the same way that two-factor authentication can do, but worse, since you're not even aware of it."</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let's take a simple example. You have an iPhone and a Windows computer. Chrome on Windows stores your passkeys in Windows Hello, so if you sign up for a service on Windows, and you then want to access it on iPhone, you're going to be stuck (unless you're so forward thinking as to add a second passkey, somehow, from the iPhone will on the Windows computer!). The passkey lives on the wrong device, if you're away from the computer and want to login, and it's not at all obvious to most users how they might fix that.</p>
<p>Even in the best case scenario, where you're using an iPhone and a Mac that are synced with Keychain Access via iCloud, you're still going to be stuck, if you need to access a service on a friend's computer in a pinch. Or if you're not using Keychain Access at all. There are plenty of pitfalls all over the flow. And the solutions, like scanning a QR code with a separate device, are cumbersome and alien to most users.</p>
<p>If you're going to teach someone how to deal with all of this, and all the potential pitfalls that might lock them out of your service, you almost might as well teach them how to use a cross-platform password manager like 1Password.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Undermining security promises</h2>
<p>The security benefits of passkeys at the moment are also undermined by an undeniable truth. Of the hundreds of sites supporting passkeys, there isn't one I know of that allows users to ditch their password completely. The password is still mandatory. And with the exception of Google's Advanced Protection Program, I know of no sites that won't allow logins to fall back on passwords, often without any additional factor. Even then, all bug Google APP accounts can be accessed using a recovery code.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>This fallback on phishable, stealable credentials undoes some of the key selling points of passkeys. As soon as passkey adoption poses a meaningful hurdle in account takeovers, threat actors will devise hacks and social engineering attacks that exploit this shortcoming. Then we're right back where we were before.</p>
<p>Christiaan Brandt, co-chair of the FIDO2 technical working group and an identity and security product manager at Google, said in an online interview that most users aren't ready for true passwordless authentication.</p>
<p>"We have to meet users where they are," he wrote. "When we tested messaging for passkeys, users balked at 'replace your password with passkeys,' but felt much more comfortable with more softened language like "you can now use a passkey to log in to your account too.' Over time, we most definitely plan to wean users off phishable authentication factors, but we anticipate this journey to take multiple years. We really can only do it once users are so comfortable with passkeys that the fallback to passwords is (almost) never needed."</p>
<p>A design choice further negating the security benefits of passkeys: Amazon, PayPal, Uber, and no small number of other sites supporting passkeys continue to rely on SMS texts for authentication even after passkeys are enrolled.</p>
<p>SMS-based MFA is among the weakest form of this protection. Not only can the texts be phished, but they're also notoriously vulnerable to SIM swaps, in which an adversary gains control of a target's phone number. As long as these less-secure fallbacks exist, passkeys aren't much more than security theater.</p>
<p>I still think passkeys make sense in many cases. I'll say more about that later. First, for a bit more context, readers should know:</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Passkeys are defined in the WebAuthn spec as a "discoverable credential," historically known as a "resident key." The credential is in the form of a private-public key pair, which is created on the security key, which can be in the form of a FIDO-approved secure enclave embedded into a USB dongle, smartphone, or computer. The key pair is unique to each user account. The user creates the key pair after proving their identity to the website using an existing authentication method, typically a password. The private key never leaves the security key.</p>
<p>Going forward, when the user logs in, the site sends a security challenge to the user. The user then uses the locally stored private key to cryptographically sign the challenge and sends it to the website. The website then uses the public key it stores to verify the response is signed with the private key. With that, the user is logged in.</p>
<p>Under the FIDO2 spec, the passkey can never leave the security key, except as an encrypted blob of bits when the passkey is being synced from one device to another. The secret key can be unlocked only when the user authenticates to the physical key using a PIN, password, or most commonly a fingerprint or face scan. In the event the user authenticates with a biometric, it never leaves the security key, just as they never leave Android and iOS phones and computers running macOS or Windows.</p>
<p>Passkeys can be stored and synced using the same mechanisms millions of people already use for passwords—a password manager such as Bitwarden, Apple iCloud, Google Password Manager, or Microsoft's cloud. Just like passwords, passkeys available in these managers are end-to-end encrypted using tried and true cryptographic algorithms.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The advent of this new paradigm was supposed to solve multiple problems at once—make authenticating ourselves online easier, eliminate the hassle of remembering passwords, and all but eradicate the most common forms of account takeovers.</p>
<p>When not encumbered by the problems mentioned earlier, this design provides multifactor authentication in a single stroke. The user logs in using something they have—the physical key, which must be near the device logging in. They must also use something they know—the PIN or password—or something they are—their face or fingerprint—to complete the credential transfer. The cryptographic secret never leaves the enclave embedded into the physical key.</p>
<h2>What to tell Uncle Charlie?</h2>
<p>In enterprise environments, passkeys can be a no-brainer alternative to passwords and authenticators. And even for Uncle Charlie—who has a single iPhone and Mac, and logs into only a handful of sites—passkeys may provide a simpler, less phishable path forward. Using a password manager to log into Gmail with a passkey ensures he's protected by MFA. Using the password alone does not.</p>
<p>The takeaway from all of this—particularly for those recruited to provide technical support this week but also anyone trying to decide if it's time to up their own authentication game: If a password manager isn't already a part of the routine, see if it's viable to add one now. Password managers make it practical to use a virtually unlimited number of long, randomly generated passwords that are unique to each site.</p>
<p>For some, particularly people with diminished capacity or less comfort being online, this step alone will be enough. Everyone else should also, whenever possible, opt into MFA, ideally using security keys or, if that's not available, an authenticator app. I'm partial to 1Password as a password manager, Authy as an authenticator, and security keys from Yubico or Titan. There are plenty of other suitable alternatives.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>I still think passkeys provide the greatest promise yet for filling the many security pitfalls of passwords and lowering the difficulty of remembering and storing them. For now, however, the hassles of using passkeys, coupled with their diminished security created by the presence of fallbacks, means no one should feel like a technophobe or laggard for sticking with their passwords. For now, passwords and key- or authenticator-based MFA remain essential.</p>
<p>With any luck, passkeys will someday be ready for the masses, but that day is not (yet) here.</p>

			<div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Apple and Meta are warring in Europe over the balance between interoperability and privacy, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-slams-metas-numerous-interoperability-requests-2024-12-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a> reports.</p>

<p>The fight focuses on the European Union’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/europes-dma-rules-for-big-tech-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Markets Act</a> (DMA), a competition regulation that requires designated gatekeepers (including Apple and Meta) not to restrict rivals’ access to core platform services. In Apple’s case, this means iOS, iPadOS, App Store, and Safari. But its concern here seems mainly focused on iOS.</p>







<p>The iPhone maker has made no bones about its distaste for the DMA, but its latest attacks take aim at Meta, rather than the pan-EU law itself — likely as EU enforcers are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/eu-to-tell-apple-how-to-do-interoperability-dma-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actively considering</a> how the DMA interoperability requirements should apply to Apple.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Apple revealed that Meta has made more interoperability requests (15) than any other company, suggesting it’s seeking far-reaching access that could be bad for users’ privacy and security.</p>

<p>Were it to grant all the requests, Apple warned that Meta’s apps (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Threads, and WhatsApp) could allow Meta to “read on a user’s device all of their messages and emails, see every phone call they make or receive, track every app that they use, scan all of their photos, look at their files and calendar events, log all of their passwords, and more.”</p>

<p>The social media giant hit back by accusing Apple of concocting privacy excuses “that have no basis in reality” to try to thwart access. </p>

<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">This is a (slightly) more active fork of <a href="https://github.com/lwthiker/curl-impersonate">curl-impersonate</a>.
Differences include:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Encrypted Client Hello(ECH) support introduced in Chrome 119.</li>
<li>ZSTD compression support introduced in Chrome 123.</li>
<li>X25519Kyber768 curve introduced in Chrome 124.</li>
<li>More options for impersonation Akamai http/2 fingerprints, especially for Safari.</li>
<li>Upgrade to more recent version of curl, 8.7.1 as of April, 2024.</li>
<li>Ability to change extension orders and enable/disable TLS grease.</li>
<li>(In progress) Single binary to support both Webkit-based and Gecko-based browsers, i.e. Chrome and Firefox.</li>

</div>
<p dir="auto">A special build of <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl">curl</a> that can impersonate the four major browsers: Chrome, Edge, Safari and Firefox(In progress). <code>curl-impersonate</code> is able to perform TLS and HTTP handshakes that are identical to that of a real browser.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>curl-impersonate</code> can be used either as a command line tool, similar to the regular curl, or as a library that can be integrated instead of the regular libcurl. See <a href="#Basic-usage">Usage</a> below.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why?</h2><a id="user-content-why" aria-label="Permalink: Why?" href="#why"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When you use an HTTP client with a TLS website, it first performs a TLS handshake. The first message of that handshake is called Client Hello. The Client Hello message that most HTTP clients and libraries produce differs drastically from that of a real browser.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the server uses HTTP/2, then in addition to the TLS handshake there is also an HTTP/2 handshake where various settings are exchanged. The settings that most HTTP clients and libraries use differ as well from those of any real browsers.</p>
<p dir="auto">For these reasons, some web services use the TLS and HTTP handshakes to fingerprint which client is accessing them, and then present different content for different clients. These methods are known as <a href="https://lwthiker.com/networks/2022/06/17/tls-fingerprinting.html" rel="nofollow">TLS fingerprinting</a> and <a href="https://lwthiker.com/networks/2022/06/17/http2-fingerprinting.html" rel="nofollow">HTTP/2 fingerprinting</a> respectively. Their widespread use has led to the web becoming less open, less private and much more restrictive towards specific web clients</p>
<p dir="auto">With the modified curl in this repository, the TLS and HTTP handshakes look <em>exactly</em> like those of a real browser.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How?</h2><a id="user-content-how" aria-label="Permalink: How?" href="#how"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To make this work, <code>curl</code> was patched significantly to resemble a browser. Specifically, The modifications that were needed to make this work:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Compiling with BoringSSL, Google's TLS library, which is used by Chrome and Safari.</li>
<li>Modifying the way curl configures various TLS extensions and SSL options.</li>
<li>Adding support for new TLS extensions.</li>
<li>Changing the settings that curl uses for its HTTP/2 connections.</li>
<li>Running curl with some non-default flags, for example <code>--ciphers</code>, <code>--curves</code> and some <code>-H</code> headers.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The resulting curl looks, from a network perspective, identical to a real browser.</p>

<li>Ubuntu - <code>sudo apt install ca-certificates zstd libzstd-dev</code></li>
<li>Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS - <code>yum install ca-certificates zstd libzstd-devel</code></li>

<p dir="auto">The pre-compiled binaries contain libcurl-impersonate and a statically compiled curl-impersonate for ease of use.</p>
<p dir="auto">The pre-compiled Linux binaries are built for Ubuntu systems. On other distributions if you have errors with certificate verification you may have to tell curl where to find the CA certificates. For example:</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>libcurl-impersonate.so</code> is libcurl compiled with the same changes as the command line <code>curl-impersonate</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">It has an additional API function:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="CURLcode curl_easy_impersonate(struct Curl_easy *data, const char *target,
                               int default_headers);"><pre><span>CURLcode</span> <span>curl_easy_impersonate</span>(<span>struct</span> <span>Curl_easy</span> <span>*</span><span>data</span>, <span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>target</span>,
                               <span>int</span> <span>default_headers</span>);</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can call it with the target names, e.g. <code>chrome123</code>, and it will internally set all the options and headers that are otherwise set by the wrapper scripts.
If <code>default_headers</code> is set to 0, the built-in list of  HTTP headers will not be set, and the user is expected to provide them instead using the regular <a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER.html" rel="nofollow"><code>CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER</code></a> libcurl option.</p>
<p dir="auto">Calling the above function sets the following libcurl options:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION</code></li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_SSLVERSION</code>,</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST</code>,</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_SSL_EC_CURVES</code>,</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_SSL_ENABLE_NPN</code>,</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_SSL_ENABLE_ALPN</code></li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_HTTPBASEHEADER</code>, if <code>default_headers</code> is non-zero (this is a non-standard HTTP option created for this project).</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_HTTP2_PSEUDO_HEADERS_ORDER</code>, sets http2 pseudo header order, for exmaple: <code>masp</code> (non-standard HTTP/2 options created for this project).</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_HTTP2_SETTINGS</code> sets the settings frame values, for example <code>1:65536;3:1000;4:6291456;6:262144</code> (non-standard HTTP/2 options created for this project).</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_HTTP2_WINDOW_UPDATE</code> sets intial window update value for http2, for example <code>15663105</code> (non-standard HTTP/2 options created for this project).</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_SSL_ENABLE_ALPS</code>, <code>CURLOPT_SSL_SIG_HASH_ALGS</code>, <code>CURLOPT_SSL_CERT_COMPRESSION</code>, <code>CURLOPT_SSL_ENABLE_TICKET</code> (non-standard TLS options created for this project).</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_SSL_PERMUTE_EXTENSIONS</code>, whether to permute extensions like Chrome 110+. (non-standard TLS options created for this project).</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_TLS_GREASE</code>, whether to enable the grease behavior. (non-standard TLS options created for this project).</li>
<li><code>CURLOPT_TLS_EXTENSION_ORDER</code>, explicit order or TLS extensions, in the format of <code>0-5-10</code>. (non-standard TLS options created for this project).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Note that if you call <code>curl_easy_setopt()</code> later with one of the above it will override the options set by <code>curl_easy_impersonate()</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using CURL_IMPERSONATE env var</h3><a id="user-content-using-curl_impersonate-env-var" aria-label="Permalink: Using CURL_IMPERSONATE env var" href="#using-curl_impersonate-env-var"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If your application uses <code>libcurl</code> already, you can replace the existing library at runtime with <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> (Linux only). You can then set the <code>CURL_IMPERSONATE</code> env var. For example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libcurl-impersonate.so CURL_IMPERSONATE=chrome116 my_app"><pre><code>LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libcurl-impersonate.so CURL_IMPERSONATE=chrome116 my_app
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The <code>CURL_IMPERSONATE</code> env var has two effects:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>curl_easy_impersonate()</code> is called automatically for any new curl handle created by <code>curl_easy_init()</code>.</li>
<li><code>curl_easy_impersonate()</code> is called automatically after any <code>curl_easy_reset()</code> call.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This means that all the options needed for impersonation will be automatically set for any curl handle.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you need precise control over the HTTP headers, set <code>CURL_IMPERSONATE_HEADERS=no</code> to disable the built-in list of HTTP headers, then set them yourself with <code>curl_easy_setopt()</code>. For example:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libcurl-impersonate.so CURL_IMPERSONATE=chrome116 CURL_IMPERSONATE_HEADERS=no my_app"><pre><code>LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libcurl-impersonate.so CURL_IMPERSONATE=chrome116 CURL_IMPERSONATE_HEADERS=no my_app
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note that the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> method will NOT WORK for <code>curl</code> itself because the curl tool overrides the TLS settings. Use the wrapper scripts instead.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>Peering into the jungle of microbes that live within us, researchers have stumbled across what seem to be an entire new class of virus-like objects.</p><p>"It's insane," says University of North Carolina cell biologist Mark Peifer, who was not involved in the study, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/it-s-insane-new-viruslike-entities-found-human-gut-microbes">told</a> Elizabeth Pennisi at <em>Science Magazine</em>. "The more we look, the more crazy things we see."</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>These mysterious bits of genetic material have no detectable sequences or even structural similarities known to any other biological agents.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>So Stanford University biologist Ivan Zheludev and colleagues argue their strange discovery may not be  <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="117810" rel="nofollow" target="_self">viruses</a> at all, but instead an entirely new group of entities that may help bridge the ancient gap between the simplest genetic molecules and more complex viruses.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>"Obelisks comprise a class of diverse RNAs that have colonized, and gone unnoticed in, human, and global microbiomes," the researchers <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.20.576352">write in a preprint paper</a>.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>Named after the highly-symmetrical, rod-like structures formed by its twisted lengths of RNA, the Obelisks' genetic sequences are only around 1,000 characters (nucleotides) in size. In fact, this brevity is likely one of the reasons we've failed to notice them previously.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>In a study that has yet to be peer reviewed, Zheludev and team searched 5.4 million datasets of published genetic sequences and identified almost 30,000 different Obelisks. They appeared in about 10 percent of the human microbiomes the team examined.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>In one set of data, Obelisks turned up in 50 percent of the patients' oral samples. What's more, different types of Obelisks appear to be present in different areas of our bodies.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>"[This] supports the notion that Obelisks might include colonists of said human microbiomes," the researchers <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.20.576352">explain</a>.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>They managed to isolate one type of host cell from our microbiome, the bacterium <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_sanguinis"><em>Streptococcus sanguini</em>s</a> – a common human mouth microbe. The Obelisk in these microbes had a loop 1,137 nucleotides long.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>"While we don't know the 'hosts' of other Obelisks," <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.20.576352">write</a> Zheludev and colleagues. "it is reasonable to assume that at least a fraction may be present in bacteria."</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>The question of the Obelisks' source aside, all seem to include codes for a new class of protein the researchers have named Oblins.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>Instructions for building these proteins seem to take up at least half of the Obelisks' genetic material. As these proteins are so similar across all the Obelisks, researchers suspect they may be involved in the entity's replication process.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>This ability to code for proteins makes them different from other known RNA loops called viroids, but they also don't seem to have the genes to make protein shells that RNA viruses (including  <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="117810" rel="nofollow" target="_self">COVID-19</a>) live within when they're outside of cells.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>They're also significantly larger than other genetic molecules that coexist inside cells, from plants to bacteria, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid">plasmids</a>, which are more commonly composed of DNA.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>However, Zheludev and team couldn't identify any impact of the Obelisks on their bacterial hosts, or a means by which they could spread between cells.</p><!-- START single/mrec -->
<!-- END single/mrec --><p>"These elements might not even be 'viral' in nature and might more closely resemble 'RNA plasmids,'" they <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.20.576352">conclude</a>.</p><p>This research has been uploaded to the preprint serve, <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.20.576352">bioRxiv</a></em>.</p>

        How I tackled takeout, spices, and meal ideas with spreadsheets and Glide.

<p>It started, like so many overwrought home optimization projects, during the pandemic.</p>
<p>My wife and I, like many people stuck inside, were ordering takeout more frequently. We wanted to support local restaurants, reduce the dish load, and live a little. It became clear early on that app-based delivery services like DoorDash and Uber Eats were not the best way to support local businesses. If a restaurant had its own ordering site or a preferred service, we wanted to use that—or even, heaven forfend, call the place.</p>
<p>The secondary issue was that we kept ordering from the same places, and we wanted to mix it up. Sometimes we'd want to pick something up nearby. Sometimes we wanted to avoid an entire category ("Too many carbs this week, no pasta") or try the newest places we knew about, or maybe a forgotten classic. Or just give me three places randomly, creative constraints, please—it's Friday.</p>
<p>At its core, this is a shared list, i.e. spreadsheet. But my spreadsheet maintenance enthusiasm greatly outweighs that of my spouse. More than that, have you ever pulled up a Google Sheet or online Excel file on your normal-sized phone to make changes? I do so only in moments of true desperation.</p>
<p>For things that are bigger than a note or dry-erase board but smaller than paying for some single-use, subscription-based app, I build little private webapps with <a href="https://www.glideapps.com/">Glide</a>. You might use something else, but Glide is a really nice entry into the spreadsheet-to-app milieu. The apps it creates are the kind that can easily be shared and installed (i.e., "Add to Home Screen") on phones, tablets, or desktops, from a browser. Here's how it worked for me.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>Why you might want to make a little personal webapp</h2>
<p>Glide is technically a no-code tool aimed at businesses, but you <a href="https://www.glideapps.com/pricing">get one user-based published app for free</a>, and you can have more "private" apps if you're truly keeping it to your household or friend group. Each full-fledged app can have 10 users and up to 25,000 rows, which should probably be enough for most uses.</p>
<p>I do wish there was a "prosumer" kind of account that billed for less than $828 per year. If you want more than one (relatively) small-scale apps, there are <a href="https://apipheny.io/no-code-app-builders/">alternatives</a>, like Google's <a href="https://www.appsheet.com/">AppSheet</a> (included in most paid Google Workspace accounts). But most are just as business-oriented, and none have struck me as elegant a tool as Glide.</p>
<p>As mentioned, my primary use for a sheet-based app is to make searching, filtering, reading, and editing that sheet far easier. In the case of my takeout app, that meant being able to search anything—a specific restaurant, "tacos," a quadrant of the District of Columbia. And a sorting option for when I added a restaurant, so I can find the place I added while a friend was recommending it.</p>

<p>Throwing that sheet fresh into Glide, it's not off to a bad start. The main view of Glide is a usable version of your app, and I can see that I can already type whatever I want into the search bar, and it will search across fields.</p>

<p>I could honestly stop here if I wasn't picky about some of the quirks I'm seeing. The app is showing screens, "Public" and "Users," and I want to hide them. In the upper-left corner, in Navigation, I'll click an eye icon to hide the "Users" section. With "Public" selected, I'll change the Label in the upper-right to "DC Takeout," and, if I was going to have more than one screen, give it an icon.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The app already provided a "+" button for adding restaurants, just a simple vertical stack of entry boxes, along with a date picker for Date Added. If you prefer something static, toggle off the options in the "Actions" field in the bottom-right.</p>
<p>Searching is pretty robust, but what if you want to browse a broad category or just see stuff that's nearby? In the "Options" section to the right, you can add in In-App Filter, which creates a familiar arrow-shaped three-bar button to the right of the search bar. I've added Quadrant and Category filters. If I want to go further here, it's on me and my spreadsheet. Open on Mondays? Offers pick-up? Has a bar? The possibilities are endless, even if my weekend spreadsheet time is not.</p>

<p>What happens when you click on a restaurant? Right now, you see, essentially, a vertical readout of everything in that spreadsheet row. What <em>could</em> you see? Well, you've got an address there, so how about a map?</p>
<p>Click on a restaurant in the fake phone, and on the left you can see "Components," one of which is our map. Set the address to equal the address column in your sheet, and, in "Options," set Visibility so that it only shows up when the address field is not empty. In "Actions," you can set it so that clicking the map opens the phone's default mapping app, set to the proper address. (If you're struggling to get the right place to show up, you might want to <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/playground/geocoding/?search_text=1341%20H%20St%20NE%2C%20Washington%2C%20DC%2020002&amp;proximity=ip&amp;searchType=forward">check out a sample address in Mapbox's API</a>; it can be a little finicky about how it parses them.)</p>

<p>That's about all I need from a "mix up your takeout and use the right apps" app, one made mostly for me, my spouse, and nearby friends and visitors. Pretty much anything you'd find useful while sitting down at a spreadsheet, you can also make useful through a little phone webapp.</p>
<h2>Joyful overkill</h2>
<p>I went a good deal further with my "DIYRoot" app. After using a couple meal delivery services, I sussed out the kinds of recipe formulas they were mixing up each week, plus the items or equivalents I had found at nearby stores. Knowing that I could figure out the basic cooking, I made an app that listed as many recipes as I could find, broke them into components, let me add them to an erasable menu plan and shopping list, and even had some pictures.</p>

<p>I didn't quite master this app (the shopping list is plagued by blank items/rows), and it's now technically an outdated "Classic" Glide app; maybe I'll give it another shot. More successful is my most recent effort, "Pantry Items," which is just a searchable list of spices and sauces, a note about how much I have left of each, and, through a webhook, add anything I see missing to a shopping list on <a href="https://www.getbring.com/en/home">Bring</a>.</p>
<p>I can feel some people reading this article demanding that I just learn Swift or some mobile-friendly JavaScript package and make some <em>real</em> apps, but I steadfastly refuse. I enjoy the messy middle of programming, where I have just enough app, API, and logic knowledge to make something small for my friends and family that's always accessible on this little computer I carry everywhere, but I have no ambitions to make it "real." Anyone can add to it through the relatively simple spreadsheet. Heck, I'll even take feature requests if I'm feeling gracious.</p>
<p>I use Glide, but you might have something else even simpler (and should recommend it as such in the comments). Just be warned that once you start thinking (or overthinking) along these lines, it can be hard to stop, even without the worldwide pandemic.</p>
