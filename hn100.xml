            <span>Abstract:</span>Discord has evolved from a gaming-focused communication tool into a versatile platform supporting diverse online communities. Despite its large user base and active public servers, academic research on Discord remains limited due to data accessibility challenges. This paper introduces Discord Unveiled: A Comprehensive Dataset of Public Communication (2015-2024), the most extensive Discord public server's data to date. The dataset comprises over 2.05 billion messages from 4.74 million users across 3,167 public servers, representing approximately 10% of servers listed in Discord's Discovery feature. Spanning from Discord's launch in 2015 to the end of 2024, it offers a robust temporal and thematic framework for analyzing decentralized moderation, community governance, information dissemination, and social dynamics. Data was collected through Discord's public API, adhering to ethical guidelines and privacy standards via anonymization techniques. Organized into structured JSON files, the dataset facilitates seamless integration with computational social science methodologies. Preliminary analyses reveal significant trends in user engagement, bot utilization, and linguistic diversity, with English predominating alongside substantial representations of Spanish, French, and Portuguese. Additionally, prevalent community themes such as social, art, music, and memes highlight Discord's expansion beyond its gaming origins.

    <section>
        <p><em>By Terts Diepraam</em></p>
<p>We are working on an embedded scripting language for Rust. This language, called <a href="https://github.com/NLnetLabs/roto?ref=blog.nlnetlabs.nl">Roto</a>, aims to be a simple yet fast and reliable scripting language for Rust applications.</p>
<p>The need for Roto comes from <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/routing/rotonda/?ref=blog.nlnetlabs.nl">Rotonda</a>, our BGP engine written in Rust. Mature BGP applications usually feature some way to filter incoming route announcements. The complexity of these filters often exceed the capabilities of configuration languages. With Rotonda, we want to allow our users to write more complex filters with ease. So we decided to give them the power of a full scripting language.</p>
<p>We have some hard requirements for this language. First, we need these filters to be fast. Second, Rotonda is critical infrastructure and so runtime crashes are unacceptable. This rules out dynamically typed languages, of which there are plenty in the Rust community.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> We want a statically typed language which can give us more type safety and speed. Finally, we want a language that is easy to pick up; it should feel like a statically typed version of scripting languages you're used to.</p>
<p>Roto fills this niche for us. In short, it's a statically typed, JIT compiled, hot-reloadable, embedded scripting language. To get good performance, Roto scripts are compiled to machine code at runtime with the <a href="https://cranelift.dev/?ref=blog.nlnetlabs.nl">cranelift</a> compiler backend.</p>
<p>Below is a small sample of a Roto script. In this script, we define a <code>filtermap</code>, which results in either <code>accept</code> or <code>reject</code>. In this case, we <code>accept</code> when the IP address is within the given range.</p>
<pre><code>filtermap within_range(range: AddrRange, ip: IpAddr) {
    if range.contains(ip) {
        accept ip
    } else {
        reject
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of a <code>filtermap</code>, we could instead write a more conventional <code>function</code>, which can simply <code>return</code> a value. The <code>filtermap</code> is a construct that Roto supports to make writing filters easier.</p>
<p>The Roto code there might look quite simple, but there's a twist: <code>AddrRange</code> is not a built-in type. Instead, it is added to Roto by the host application (e.g. Rotonda), making it available for use in the script.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> Similarly, the <code>contains</code> method on <code>AddrRange</code> is provided by the host application as well. The full code necessary to run the script above is listed below. This example is also available <a href="https://github.com/NLnetLabs/roto/blob/a4edc7fcea79a2498798f69da4cdb9beb6ecd4d1/examples/addr_range.rs?ref=blog.nlnetlabs.nl">on our GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<pre><code>use std::net::IpAddr;
use std::path::Path;
use roto::{roto_method, FileTree, Runtime, Val, Verdict};

#[derive(Clone)]
struct AddrRange {
    min: IpAddr,
    max: IpAddr,
}

fn run_script(path: &amp;Path) {
    // Create a runtime
    let mut runtime = Runtime::new();
    
    // Register the AddrRange type into the runtime with a docstring
    runtime
        .register_clone_type::&lt;AddrRange&gt;("A range of IP addresses")
        .unwrap();
    
    // Register the contains method on AddrRange
    #[roto_method(runtime, AddrRange)]
    fn contains(range: &amp;AddrRange, addr: &amp;IpAddr) -&gt; bool {
        range.min &lt;= addr &amp;&amp; addr &lt;= range.max
    }
    
    // Compile the program
    let program =
        FileTree::read(path).compile(runtime).unwrap();

    // Extract the Roto filtermap, which is accessed as a function
    let function = program
        .get_function::&lt;(), (Val&lt;AddrRange&gt;, IpAddr), Verdict&lt;IpAddr, ()&gt;&gt;(
          "within_range"
        )
        .unwrap();
    
    // Run the filtermap
    let range = AddrRange {
        min: "10.10.10.10".parse().unwrap(),
        max: "10.10.10.12".parse().unwrap(),
    };

    let in_range = "10.10.10.11".parse().unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", function.call(&amp;mut (), range, in_range)));

    let out_of_range = "10.10.11.10".parse().unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", function.call(&amp;mut (), range, out_of_range));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that nothing in the script is run automatically when the script is loaded, as happens in many other scripting language. The host application decides which functions and filtermaps it extracts from the script and when to run them.</p>
<p>Roto is very tightly integrated with Rust. Many Rust types<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>, methods and functions can be registered directly for use in Roto. These types can be passed to Roto at negligible cost; there is no serialization between Roto and Rust. For Rotonda, this means that Roto can operate on raw BGP messages without costly conversion procedures.</p>
<p>The registration mechanism also ensures that Roto is not limited to Rotonda and could easily be used outside that context. It is designed as a general scripting or plug-in language.</p>
<p>We have many planned features on the roadmap for Roto and will continue to improve this language. This also means that the language should not be considered stable, though we'd love to hear feedback if you experiment with it. If you're interested, check out the <a href="https://rotonda.docs.nlnetlabs.nl/en/stable/roto/00_introduction.html?ref=blog.nlnetlabs.nl">documentation</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NlnetLabs/roto?ref=blog.nlnetlabs.nl">repository</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NLnetLabs/roto/tree/main/examples?ref=blog.nlnetlabs.nl">examples</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1krttqo/my_new_hobby_watching_ai_slowly_drive_microsoft/">https://old.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1krttqo/my_new_hobby_watching_ai_slowly_drive_microsoft/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44050152">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs">/r/ExperiencedDevs</a> subreddit! We hope you will find this as a valuable resource in your journeys down the fruitful CS/IT career paths. This community leans towards being a specialized subreddit facilitating discussion amongst individuals who have gained some ground in the IT world. </p>

<p>For an idea of what is encouraged in this subreddit and what is not (please report anything that does not follow the rules):</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/about/rules/">Rules</a></h2>

<p><strong>1. Do not participate unless experienced (3+ years)</strong></p>

<p>If you have less than 3 years of experience as a developer, do not make a post, nor participate in comments threads except for the weekly ‚ÄúAsk Experienced Devs‚Äù auto-thread. No exceptions.</p>

<p><strong>2. No Disrespectful Language or Conduct</strong></p>

<p>Don‚Äôt be a jerk. Act maturely. No racism, unnecessarily foul language, ad hominem charges, sexism - none of these are tolerated here. This includes posts that could be interpreted as trolling, such as complaining about DEI (Diversity) initiatives or people of a specific sex or background at your company.</p>

<p>Do not submit posts or comments that break, or promote breaking the Reddit Terms and Conditions or Content Policy or any other Reddit policy.</p>

<p>Violations = Warning, 7-Day Ban, Permanent Ban.</p>

<p><strong>3. No General Career Advice</strong></p>

<p>This sub is for discussing issues specific to experienced developers. </p>

<p>Any career advice thread must contain questions and/or discussions that notably benefit from the participation of experienced developers. Career advice threads may be removed at the moderators discretion based on response to the thread."</p>

<p>General rule of thumb: If the advice you are giving (or seeking) could apply to a ‚ÄúSenior Chemical Engineer‚Äù, it‚Äôs not appropriate for this sub.</p>

<p><strong>4. No "Which Offer Should I Take" Posts</strong></p>

<p>Asking if you should ask for a raise, switch companies (‚Äúshould I work for company A or company B‚Äù), ‚Äúshould I take offer A or offer B‚Äù, or related questions, is not appropriate for this sub. </p>

<p>This includes almost any discussion about a ‚Äúhot market‚Äù, comparing compensation between companies, etc.</p>

<p><strong>5. No ‚ÄúWhat Should I Learn‚Äù Questions</strong></p>

<p>No questions like ‚ÄúShould I learn C#‚Äù or ‚ÄúShould I switch jobs into a language I don‚Äôt know?‚Äù</p>

<p>Discussion about industry direction or upcoming technologies is fine, just frame your question as part of a larger discussion (‚ÄúWhat have you had more success with, RDBMS or NoSQL?‚Äù) and you‚Äôll be fine.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Don‚Äôt make it about you/yourself.</p>

<p><strong>6. No ‚ÄúI hate X types of interviews" Posts</strong></p>

<p>This has been re-hashed over and over again. There is no interesting/new content coming out.</p>

<p>It might be OK to talk about the merits of an interview process, or compare what has been successful at your company, but if it ends up just turning into complaints your post might still be removed.</p>

<h2><strong>Time is money, money is value</strong></h2>



<p>Okay, I‚Äôll admit that calling your software worthless was a shameless clickbait tactic. However, I will assert that it‚Äôs not as valuable or indispensable as you might think it is. You need two things to solve a problem using software, skill and time.</p>



<p>Skill. Of course, you can create code using unskilled practitioners. The code might even work, but that‚Äôs not the same thing as solving the problem. Bad code is an issue in itself, so even if you solve your original problem, you now have a new, possibly bigger one to deal with. Skill is essential if you‚Äôre going to succeed and talent doesn‚Äôt come cheap.</p>



<p>Time. Coding can happen quickly, but solving problems is tricky. It takes time, and time is money. A software development team is not cheap to run, so any decent piece of software is going to incur significant cost. If you‚Äôre going to put investment into your solution, you should expect it to be worth something when you‚Äôre done.</p>



<p>So, why am I suggesting that the code is worthless? If it solves the problem, it‚Äôs delivering value. Worthless seems a bit harsh. It‚Äôs true that I‚Äôm exaggerating, but not by much. To understand, let‚Äôs take another look at that solution, and the time that went into it. It‚Äôs easy to focus on the software and ignore what surrounds it.</p>



<h2><strong>How to bake a cake</strong></h2>



<p>Firstly, there‚Äôs the team. You have to find the right, skilled, people, and bring them together. Then, they have to establish clear roles and responsibilities and learn to work together as a cohesive team. Finally that team has to establish relationships with the stakeholders and users, and familiarise themselves with the problem space.</p>



<p>This takes time.</p>



<p>Secondly, there‚Äôs the business logic. Even the simplest of solutions has to perform some sort of business processing. Someone has to work out what that logic needs to be and codify it.</p>



<p>This takes time.</p>



<p>Thirdly, there‚Äôs the design. If the code is user facing, it delivers an experience to the user. That experience is (hopefully) developed over time through careful design, feedback and iteration.</p>



<p>This takes time.</p>



<p>And finally, there‚Äôs the code. That also takes time, but that time is small in comparison to all the others. Sometimes it feels as if all the effort is going into the code and the other parts are incidental. However, the reality is that very little of the productive time ends up as code in the live solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the code will be replaced by alternatives as part of the iterative feedback approach. Some of the code will remain, but will no longer be used as a result of changes to the design. Some of the code will have been written in anticipation of a situation that never arises.</p>



<p>The developer‚Äôs answer to all of this is ‚Äúrefactoring‚Äù. For those of you who don‚Äôt code, refactoring is the process of reviewing existing code and making a range of improvements whilst retaining the core functionality.</p>



<p>This takes time.</p>



<h2><strong>Knowledge is power</strong></h2>



<p>When you add all the time together, you get the cost of your software solution, and you could argue that this represents the value of the code. You might even argue that the value of the code exceeds the cost.</p>



<p>This is where I disagree. My opinion is that in doing this you are conflating the codebase and the solution. All the value is stored up in the team, the logic and the design, and very little of it is in the code itself. Originally this view was just a hypothesis without any form of proof, but over time I‚Äôve had the opportunity to run experiments to test this hypothesis.</p>



<p>One particular experiment involved a web portal I was involved in developing as part of an all remote team back just before the turn of the millennium. Smartphones didn‚Äôt exist, and the internet was still a fairly new concept to many people. The portal was for a growing internet service provider.</p>



<p>The work took a team of just 7 people 6 months to develop and the result was a cross platform solution that could deliver content, email, calendering and messaging. It was ahead of its time, and also supported voice interaction via mobile phone and delivery of content via WAP. What‚Äôs WAP? Google it ‚Äì the days before smartphones were far from sophisticated when it comes to mobile access to the internet.</p>



<p>The result was good enough to be bought up by a large organisation as their portal solution. That company had already spent longer than 6 months with a significantly larger team trying to create the same thing without success. We were rightly proud of what we‚Äôd achieved in such a short time and with such a small team.</p>



<p>So, my experiment related to something that was already considered very efficient in code development terms.</p>



<h2><strong>We can rebuild it!</strong></h2>



<p>What I did was spend a couple of weeks at home recreating the solution from scratch. The code now belonged to a third party so I wanted a completely new version I could call my own. I used nothing from the original apart from my own knowledge of the problem and my experience solving it. The code repository was no longer accessible, so I couldn‚Äôt copy anything from it, even if I‚Äôd wanted to. To do so would have also been unethical as it didn‚Äôt belong to me. So, every line of code was genuinely built from scratch.</p>



<p>Within two weeks I had a fully working solution that did everything the original did (and a bit more). I‚Äôd achieved this in no time at all, and I‚Äôd generated a fraction of the code compared to the original solution.</p>



<p>How did I achieve this? Was I some kind of coding genius? Obviously not. I was a very competent coder, very much at the top of my game, but I was just one coder. No matter how good you are, there‚Äôs a limit to how fast you can type.</p>



<p>No. I achieved this because the code contained very little of the real value. That was all stored in my head. The design was in my head, and with hindsight I could see all its flaws. I was therefore able to create a much more efficient and effective design based on that learning. All the mistakes had been made, so I was able to get this version of the code right the first time. Most of my tests ran successfully, and debugging time was almost non-existent.</p>



<p>I now knew what wasn‚Äôt needed. All those things we‚Äôd built in to cater for anticipated needs could now be whittled down to the few that really proved useful. I understood every piece of technology, every protocol and every library, so there was no learning curve.</p>



<h2><strong>Mostly worthless</strong></h2>



<p>From this, I can conclude that of the 6 months of time spent by 7 people creating this solution, hardly any of it related to the code. It could be completely discarded and rebuilt by one person in under two weeks. What‚Äôs more, it could be radically improved at the same time.</p>



<p>So, this is why I assert that your code is worthless when compared to the overall effort invested in the creation of your solution. And I‚Äôd go further than that. I‚Äôd suggest that, contrary to what intuition might tell you, refactoring might be better achieved by throwing the code away and starting again.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs a scary thought. You might even consider it ridiculously farfetched. I wouldn‚Äôt expect you to agree with me based on a blog post. However, what I would recommend is that you give it some serious thought, and maybe conduct a similar experiment of your own. If you do, let me know how you get on. I‚Äôd be genuinely interested to find out.</p>



<p>Maybe I‚Äôm special? Maybe I‚Äôm the mythical ten times developer? Personally, I doubt it very much. After all, I was one of the people who took six months to build it the first time round.</p>



<p>Oh, and remember this next time you have to fix someone else‚Äôs code. It‚Äôs easy to feel superior and knowledgeable. It‚Äôs tempting to laugh at the obvious mistakes made by those who came before, but you have the advantage of hindsight. Maybe consider instead that you might be standing on the shoulders of those who carved out the first path for you to follow.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>i was addicted to instagram for about a month. it upended my life enough that i realized that i was living with something new-an undesirable habit. and once i realized this, it seemed like it would be wise to try to address it or at least think about it. easier said than done.</p>

<p>i left instagram for about three to four months cold turkey-i left a video saying i was leaving, then uninstalled the app.</p>

<p>there‚Äôs a few things to talk about here. first, as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/saltzshaker.bsky.social">emily</a> noted to me, this is why kids today can be so bitter about their relationships with their own phones. kids (which is anyone younger than 43) watch movies from the early 2000s with a kind of wistfulness because, wow, people lived normal, natural lives without phones. maybe it‚Äôs obvious to you, but when you‚Äôre 43, you completely grew up without phones. phones were an absolutely new thing that happened in the middle of your 43-year old‚Äôs life.</p>

<p>i grew up quite familiar with the state of being absolutely bored to the gills. boredom was just a sensation that you had, like pain or hunger. you‚Äôd stare in some direction and you‚Äôd be bored. but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be a thing i feel anymore. now it‚Äôs mostly about dealing with self-control and somehow thinking about it all the time. it is not relaxing. the phone is in your pocket. it‚Äôs on your body.</p>

<hr>

<p>i hope i‚Äôm not using ‚Äúaddiction‚Äù in a way that trivializes it. some people (have to) deal with their own intense relationships with (substances, habits), and i would never want you to think that what i dealt with is the same as that.</p>

<p>obviously, so many forms of addiction have had an enormous impact on so many lives-upending them, transforming them, taking people from one direction (their wishes, dreams, circumstances) to a very opposite one.</p>

<p>i hope it‚Äôs clear i am more than sympathetic.</p>

<hr>

<hr>

<hr>

<hr>

<hr>

<hr>

<p>i developed a habit that would break my sleep in a specific way: i would get up at four a.m. and watch reels for about two to three hours.</p>

<p>what‚Äôs impressive about that is that two hours for a movie is nothing‚Äîit‚Äôs one movie. if i had been getting up in the middle of the night every night to watch superman, you‚Äôd think, ‚Äúwow, this guy‚Äôs into superman.‚Äù i‚Äôd probably learn a lot of superman trivia that i could drop into regular conversation. maybe i‚Äôd wonder why i didn‚Äôt just do that after work as you could easily combine a nine-to-five job with an intense level of superman fandom.</p>

<p>but an instagram reel or any sort of short-form video‚Ä¶‚Äîreally, ‚Äúshort-form‚Äù isn‚Äôt strong nor short enough of a word. six seconds isn‚Äôt short. it‚Äôs instant. it‚Äôs zero seconds. there is no difference between zero seconds and six seconds in any timeline unless you build atomic watches or run <a href="https://time.gov/">time.gov</a>. if any clock in your house was off by six seconds, you wouldn‚Äôt spend any amount of time thinking about that. and yet this new art form can tell a story with multiple edits within a single six-second timeframe.</p>

<p>it‚Äôs an incredible achievement. who among us even knows if akira kurosawa could make a good six-second reel? (please don‚Äôt use a generative ai to generate 6 second akira kurosawa-styled tiktok videos, even if nothing could ever prevent you from doing this.)</p>

<hr>

<p>ok but the six-second video format <em>is</em> extremely impressive from a narrative, storytelling, and comedy point of view. the art of editing has probably improved globally or developed some sort of new appendix, which i hope doesn‚Äôt metastasize into all moviemaking. but cutting your teeth on making a good six-second video must somehow give you incredible editing abilities. i totally get it as a training ground for filmmakers or anyone that‚Äôs into storytelling.</p>

<p>that‚Äôs the good part. the good part is the fun and addictive part‚Äîthere are truly incredible videos out there, even though i am not going to link to them. if i told you the story of how heroin felt, i would probably not tell you where to get it. if you truly needed heroin (who needs heroin?), you‚Äôd be pursuing it anyway and would probably find your way to some heroin mart. but i hope you don‚Äôt do either heroin or short videos. the problem is, short videos are a lot harder to escape.</p>

<p>it was also so obvious to see that not every six-second video was good or seemed interesting to me. in that span of a few hours, i‚Äôd get a few‚Äîsometimes one, sometimes five, rarely 10‚Äîthat were the funniest videos i had ever seen in my life. but that‚Äôs just a slot machine: you keep pressing the button like a rat and the button gives you drugs, but randomly, which is the worst/best kind of addiction-creating mechanism. it‚Äôs why inbox addiction is also a thing (that i have): never knowing when you‚Äôll get an email, you keep reloading until you inevitably get one.</p>

<hr>

<hr>

<p>recently, i reinstalled instagram to post a video and a music video, then uninstalled it and reinstalled it and uninstalled it at least six times in the last week. unfortunately, the app felt just as good as before. i‚Äôm not sure if the algorithm got better‚Äîi understand that this is probably not what happened, and i was just missing it. but instagram knows me.</p>

<p>most of the videos it was offering were super bizarre, out-of-this-world noise performances where artists were setting instruments on fire, which appealed to me enormously. there were grandmas doing cooking and hip hop in mandarin, videos of religious sects with incredible sound and reverb‚Äîamazing soundscapes i had never seen before. all of this content came streaming back and it unfortunately felt really great.</p>

<p>during the period when i didn‚Äôt have the app, every alternative felt not as good. i tried to fill the place of the addictive cigarette with carrots, but carrots don‚Äôt (yet) contain nicotine, and you can taste the difference. i started reading the news again a lot‚Äîin a very ‚Äúreload the news five times a day‚Äù kind of way.</p>

<p>the news didn‚Äôt feel as good, and going back to the news now still feels like a lesser version of the previous short video hole filling activity. news doesn‚Äôt know you as well as the algorithm. also it‚Äôs hard knowing that instagram is always there.</p>

<p>of course, the app also offers connection. there are multiple communities i joined or keep informed of or partake in or just watch, sometimes completely from a distance. but i can also strike up conversations, and i‚Äôve been able to meet people from there. this isn‚Äôt saying anything new‚Äîonline friendships have always been a thing, and those that cross from online to offline have been in my life for a while.</p>

<p>so instagram, like any social media app, combines addiction with everything else. addictive videos on one hand that fill holes, but those videos are also funny and original. they feel like a waste of time, but they‚Äôre also entertaining. you connect with people, but the messaging part is tied to the video part, and you can‚Äôt do one without the other. truly, any accidental ui swipe on instagram brings you back to reels‚Äîit‚Äôs the thing in the app with the most gravity.</p>

<hr>

<p>emily pointed out two things regarding this. first, using instagram on desktop is enough of a deterrent for her. it lacks the slickness of mobile, so it has fewer addictive attributes. she would want just that, but minus the reels, which isn‚Äôt possible in the desktop version unless you install a browser extension and muck around.</p>

<p>second, she‚Äôs convinced that in some future some laws might pass (in europe?) to force apps like instagram to give you an option to turn off reels. this would probably take the form of family controls that make sense for parents and would integrate with other tools used to limit screen time. but for adults, of course, you‚Äôre on your own (adulting is hard). i‚Äôm not sure what the options are or could be. apps that try to limit screen time feel ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù knowing i could uninstall them, and i wouldn‚Äôt want an app i couldn‚Äôt uninstall. you/i could set a family screen time restriction, give the password to a friend, but then they‚Äôd be responsible for managing your/my emotions anytime you/i‚Äôd have a flare-up, which is so completely worse.</p>

<hr>

<p>so here‚Äôs where i am today: i uninstalled the app and deleted it from my phone, as i‚Äôve done dozens of times. then i went into my phone‚Äôs preferences and disabled the ability to install new apps and make in-app purchases.</p>

<p>so i‚Äôm just two very easy toggles away from reinstalling instagram and going back in. i‚Äôm also happy to share that i‚Äôve actually created a calendar of things i do want to post, i.e. a social media content calendar! ((to be more intentional about when i use the app)) and i am looking forward to sharing that content because i think it might be funny, and someone might like it.</p>

<p>but! because of this, i already know that i‚Äôll be turning those toggles off. and it will feel good again, and i‚Äôll know that it‚Äôs not the right kind of good. and it will seem like that‚Äôs all there is to it, and that will also be not true.</p>

          <p><a href="https://litestream.io/" title="">Litestream</a> is an open-source tool that makes it possible to run many kinds of full-stack applications on top of SQLite by making them reliably recoverable from object storage. This is a post about the biggest change we‚Äôve made to it since I launched it.</p>
<p>Nearly a decade ago, I got a bug up my ass. I wanted to build full-stack applications quickly. But the conventional n-tier database design required me to do sysadmin work for each app I shipped. Even the simplest applications depended on heavy-weight database servers like Postgres or MySQL.</p>

<p>I wanted to launch apps on SQLite, because SQLite is easy. But SQLite is embedded, not a server, which at the time implied that the data for my application lived (and died) with just one server.</p>

<p>So in 2020, I wrote <a href="https://litestream.io/" title="">Litestream</a> to fix that.</p>

<p>Litestream is a tool that runs alongside a SQLite application. Without changing that running application, it takes over the WAL checkpointing process to continuously stream database updates to an S3-compatible object store. If something happens to the server the app is running on, the whole database can efficiently be restored to a different server. You might lose servers, but you won‚Äôt lose your data.</p>

<p>Litestream worked well. So we got ambitious. A few years later, we built <a href="https://github.com/superfly/litefs" title="">LiteFS</a>. LiteFS takes the ideas in Litestream and refines them, so that we can do read replicas and primary failovers with SQLite. LiteFS gives SQLite the modern deployment story of an n-tier database like Postgres, while keeping the database embedded.</p>

<p>We like both LiteFS and Litestream. But Litestream is the more popular project. It‚Äôs easier to deploy and easier to reason about.</p>

<p>There are some good ideas in LiteFS. We‚Äôd like Litestream users to benefit from them. So we‚Äôve taken our LiteFS learnings and applied them to some new features in Litestream.</p>
<h2 id="point-in-time-restores-but-fast"><a href="#point-in-time-restores-but-fast" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Point-in-time restores, but fast</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://fly.io/blog/all-in-on-sqlite-litestream/" title="">Here‚Äôs how Litestream was originally designed</a>: you run <code>litestream</code> against a SQLite database, and it opens up a long-lived read transaction. This transaction arrests SQLite WAL checkpointing, the process by which SQLite consolidates the WAL back into the main database file. Litestream builds a ‚Äúshadow WAL‚Äù that records WAL pages, and copies them to S3.</p>

<p>This is simple, which is good. But it can also be slow. When you want to restore a database, you have have to pull down and replay every change since the last snapshot. If you changed a single database page a thousand times, you replay a thousand changes. For databases with frequent writes, this isn‚Äôt a good approach.</p>

<p>In LiteFS, we took a different approach. LiteFS is transaction-aware. It doesn‚Äôt simply record raw WAL pages, but rather ordered ranges of pages associated with transactions, using a file format we call <a href="https://github.com/superfly/ltx" title="">LTX</a>. Each LTX file represents a sorted changeset of pages for a given period of time.</p>

<p><img alt="a simple linear LTX file with 8 pages between 1 and 21" src="https://fly.io/blog/litestream-revamped/assets/linear-ltx.png"></p>

<p>Because they are sorted, we can easily merge multiple LTX files together and create a new LTX file with only the latest version of each page.</p>

<p><img alt="merging three LTX files into one" src="https://fly.io/blog/litestream-revamped/assets/merged-ltx.png"></p>
<p>This is similar to how an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree" title="">LSM tree</a> works.</p>
<p>This process of combining smaller time ranges into larger ones is called <em>compaction</em>. With it, we can replay a SQLite database to a specific point in time, with a minimal  duplicate pages.</p>
<h2 id="casaas-compare-and-swap-as-a-service"><a href="#casaas-compare-and-swap-as-a-service" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>CASAAS: Compare-and-Swap as a Service</span></h2>
<p>One challenge Litestream has to deal with is desynchronization. Part of the point of Litestream is that SQLite applications don‚Äôt have to be aware of it. But <code>litestream</code> is just a process, running alongside the application, and it can die independently. If <code>litestream</code> is down while database changes occur, it will miss changes. The same kind of problem occurs if you start replication from a new server.</p>

<p>Litestream needs a way to reset the replication stream from a new snapshot. How it does that is with ‚Äúgenerations‚Äù. <a href="https://litestream.io/how-it-works/#snapshots--generations" title="">A generation</a> represents a snapshot and a stream of WAL updates, uniquely identified. Litestream notices any break in its WAL sequence and starts a new generation, which is how it recovers from desynchronization.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, storing and managing multiple generations makes it difficult to implement features like failover and read-replicas.</p>

<p>The most straightforward way around this problem is to make sure only one instance of Litestream can replication to a given destination. If you can do that, you can store just a single, latest generation. That in turn makes it easy to know how to resync a read replica; there‚Äôs only one generation to choose from.</p>

<p>In LiteFS, we solved this problem by using Consul, which guaranteed a single leader. That requires users to know about Consul. Things like ‚Äúrequiring Consul‚Äù are probably part of the reason Litestream is so much more popular than LiteFS.</p>

<p>In Litestream, we‚Äôre solving the problem a different way. Modern object stores like S3 and Tigris solve this problem for us: they now offer <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/11/amazon-s3-functionality-conditional-writes/" title="">conditional write support</a>. With conditional writes, we can implement a time-based lease. We get essentially the same constraint Consul gave us, but without having to think about it or set up a dependency.</p>

<p>In the immediacy, this will mean you can run Litestream with ephemeral nodes, with overlapping run times, and even if they‚Äôre storing to the same destination, they won‚Äôt confuse each other.</p>
<h2 id="lightweight-read-replicas"><a href="#lightweight-read-replicas" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Lightweight read replicas</span></h2>
<p>The original design constraint of both Litestream and LiteFS was to extend SQLite, to modern deployment scenarios, without disturbing people‚Äôs built code. Both tools are meant to function even if applications are oblivious to them.</p>

<p>LiteFS is more ambitious than Litestream, and requires transaction-awareness. To get that without disturbing built code, we use a cute trick (a.k.a. a gross hack): LiteFS provides a FUSE filesystem, which lets it act as a proxy between the application and the backing store. From that vantage point, we can easily discern transactions.</p>

<p>The FUSE approach gave us a lot of control, enough that users could use SQLite replicas just like any other database. But installing and running a whole filesystem (even a fake one) is a lot to ask of users. To work around that problem, we relaxed a constraint: LiteFS can function without the FUSE filesystem if you load an extension into your application code, <a href="https://github.com/superfly/litevfs" title="">LiteVFS</a>.  LiteVFS is a <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/vfs.html" title="">SQLite Virtual Filesystem</a> (VFS). It works in a variety of environments, including some where FUSE can‚Äôt, like in-browser WASM builds.</p>

<p>What we‚Äôre doing next is taking the same trick and using it on Litestream. We‚Äôre building a VFS-based read-replica layer. It will be able to fetch and cache pages directly from S3-compatible object storage.</p>

<p>Of course, there‚Äôs a catch: this approach isn‚Äôt as efficient as a local SQLite database. That kind of efficiency, where you don‚Äôt even need to think about N+1 queries because there‚Äôs no network round-trip to make the duplicative queries pile up costs, is part of the point of using SQLite.</p>

<p>But we‚Äôre optimistic that with cacheing and prefetching, the approach we‚Äôre using will yield, for the right use cases, strong performance ‚Äî all while serving SQLite reads hot off of Tigris or S3.</p>

<h2 id="synchronize-lots-of-databases"><a href="#synchronize-lots-of-databases" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Synchronize Lots Of Databases</span></h2>
<p>While we‚Äôve got you here: we‚Äôre knocking out one of our most requested features.</p>

<p>In the old Litestream design, WAL-change polling and slow restores made it infeasible to replicate large numbers of databases from a single process. That has been our answer when users ask us for a ‚Äúwildcard‚Äù or ‚Äúdirectory‚Äù replication argument for the tool.</p>

<p>Now that we‚Äôve switched to LTX, this isn‚Äôt a problem any more. It should thus be possible to replicate <code>/data/*.db</code>, even if there‚Äôs hundreds or thousands of databases in that directory.</p>
<h2 id="we-still-sqlite"><a href="#we-still-sqlite" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>We Still ‚ù§Ô∏è SQLite</span></h2>
<p>SQLite has always been a solid database to build on and it‚Äôs continued to find new use cases as the industry evolves. We‚Äôre super excited to continue to build Litestream alongside it.</p>

<p>We have a sneaking suspicion that the robots that write LLM code are going to like SQLite too. We think what <a href="https://phoenix.new/" title="">coding agents like Phoenix.new</a> want is a way to try out code on live data, screw it up, and then rollback <em>both the code and the state.</em> These Litestream updates put us in a position to give agents PITR as a primitive. On top of that, you can build both rollbacks and forks.</p>

<p>Whether or not you‚Äôre drinking the AI kool-aid, we think this new design for Litestream is just better. We‚Äôre psyched to be rolling it out, and for the features it‚Äôs going to enable.</p>

<p dir="auto">the NSA selector's native format is 4 bits and 25MS/s which originates from the
typical PHY MAC interface called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media-independent_interface" rel="nofollow">MII</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">at first glance 4 bit audio appears to be really crappy, but we can use the
ridiculously high sample rate. what we need is called a delta-sigma modulator.
this lets us convert a simple mono 16 bit 48kHz .wav file to a 4 bit 25MHz
.nsa file.</p>
<p dir="auto">note that this saturates the link and through the added headers from ethernet,
IP, UDP or TCP and HTTP you'll get artifacts. and happy litte retransmissions.</p>
<p dir="auto">far from HiFi quality, but the method adds a lot of spice and excitement.</p>

<p dir="auto">and we're listening in on the "4B" side of the "4B5B encoding" layer.
so the first bits we hear are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame#Preamble_and_start_frame_delimiter" rel="nofollow">the preamble of the ethernet frame</a> and we follow up the stack. e.g. ethernet, IP, TCP, HTTP, BMP.</p>

<p dir="auto">there's a neat little idea I had during development to add a delay to say a
sequencer pattern. actually it's more like an echo than a delay since it lacks
precise timing control.
ssh log into the remote machine that creates the e.g. ping traffic. then dump
the network traffic to the text console to double it. you can increase verbosity
levels of the dump to crank up the echo until total saturation of the link
and lost captured packets. see the video if this explanation is not clear to you.</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>tcpdump -ni eth0</code></p>

<p>(*) Not implemented yet.</p><p>(**) Temporarily split in two binaries</p><p>
Red‚Äôs ambitious goal is to build the world‚Äôs first <b>full-stack language</b>, a language you can use from system programming tasks, up to high-level scripting through DSL. You've probably heard of the term "<a href="http://www.laurencegellert.com/2012/08/what-is-a-full-stack-developer/" target="_blank">Full-Stack Developer</a>". But what is a full-stack Language, exactly?</p><p>

Other languages talk about having "one tool to rule them all". Red has that mindset too, pushed to the limit - it's a single executable that takes in your source files on any platform, and produces a packaged binary for any platform, from any other. The tool doesn‚Äôt depend on anything besides what came with your OS...shipping as a single executable that about a megabyte.</p><p>

But that technical feat alone isn't enough to define Red's notion of a "Full-Stack Language". It's about the ability to bend and redefine the system to meet any need, while still working with literate code, and getting top-flight performance. &nbsp;So what's being put in your hands is more like a "language construction set" than simply "a language". Whether you‚Äôre writing a device driver, a platform-native GUI application, or a shared library... Red lets you use a common syntax to code at the right level of abstraction for the task.</p><p><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg-ipzNCeWoKszMhyphenhyphen3My5TZK7xAnpvQBa8LBx6kZo2CVYCuGBD9-BaBg2A5qGn1IO_BiFdTaBpxXR4Nv2lWjtU-H85Yn3xok1IsvnZhpswRoulh6QZen1w23DWwyCeUA1TUZxhM_2pkxJ4/s1600/reichart-abstraction-diagram.png">

It was announced and presented for the first time&nbsp;at <a href="http://reborcon.esperconsultancy.nl/">ReBorCon 2011</a> conference (March, 2011).&nbsp;A more recent presentation video was given at the Recode conference in Montreal (July, 2013):</p><p>
