</div><p>John Riccitiello, CEO of <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/unity-adds-fee-for-installs-for-successful-developers-triggering-a-backlash/">Unity</a>, has resigned from the company in the wake of a pricing controversy that left developers in open revolt. </p>



<p>Unity said in a press release that James M. Whitehurst has been appointed interim CEO and president of the company. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, hoping to avoid a stock panic, Unity said that it is reaffirming its previous guidance for its fiscal third quarter financial results, which will be reported on November 9. </p>



<p>Roelof Botha, lead independent director of the Unity board, has been appointed chairman. Riccitiello will continue to advise Unity to ensure a smooth transition, the company said. The news isn’t a surprise as Unity angered a lot of its loyal game developers a few weeks ago after pushing through a price increase based on numbers of downloads — and then retracted it after an uproar.</p>

                        </p></div><p>Unity said the board will initiate a comprehensive search process, with the assistance of a leading executive search firm, to identify a permanent CEO.</p>



<p>“Working with Unity under John’s leadership has been one of the highlights of my career. John joined the Unity Board in 2013 and stepped in to lead the company in 2014, at a time when we faced significant challenges,” Botha said, in a statement. “John has led Unity through incredible growth over the last nearly 10 years, helping us transition from a perpetual license to a subscription model, enabling developers to monetize, building other game services to serve our creator community, leading us through an IPO and positioning us as a pioneer in the developer community. Unity would not be where it is today without the impact of his contributions. I remain excited for the future of Unity.”</p>



<p>“It’s been a privilege to lead Unity for nearly a decade and serve our employees, customers, developers and partners, all of whom have been instrumental to the company’s growth,” Riccitiello said in a statement. “I look forward to supporting Unity through this transition and following the company’s future success.”</p>



<p>Whitehurst is a seasoned technology and public company executive. He previously served as senior advisor and president at IBM, after joining through IBM’s acquisition of Red Hat, a leading provider of open-source enterprise IT products and services, where he served as president and CEO from 2008 to 2020.</p>



<p>“I am honored to join Unity as interim CEO and President at this important time in its evolution,” Whitehurst said in a statement. “With the company’s experienced leadership and passionate employees, I am confident that Unity is well-positioned to continue enhancing its platform, strengthening its community of customers, developers and partners, and focusing on its growth and profitability goals. I look forward to working closely with the Board and our talented global team to execute on our strategy, and I anticipate a seamless transition.”</p>



<p>Unity will release third quarter 2023 financial results after the market close on Thursday, November 9, 2023, with a webcast to follow at 2 p.m. PT. </p>

<p><em>This article is part of our&nbsp;coverage of the latest in&nbsp;<a href="https://bdtechtalks.com/tag/ai-research-papers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI research</a>.</em></p>



<p>Scientists are inventing various strategies to enhance the accuracy and reasoning abilities of large language models (<a href="https://bdtechtalks.com/tag/large-language-models/">LLM</a>) such as <a href="https://bdtechtalks.com/2023/04/03/augmented-language-models/" title="">retrieval augmentation</a> and chain-of-thought reasoning.</p>



<p>Among these, “self-correction”—a technique where an LLM refines its own responses—has gained significant traction, demonstrating efficacy across numerous applications. However, the mechanics behind its success remain elusive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01798">recent study</a> conducted by Google DeepMind in collaboration with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign reveals that LLMs often falter when self-correcting their responses without external feedback. In fact, the study suggests that self-correction can sometimes impair the performance of these models, challenging the prevailing understanding of this popular technique.</p>



<h2>What is self-correction?</h2>



<div>




<p>Self-correction is predicated on the idea that LLMs can assess the accuracy of their outputs and refine their responses. For instance, an LLM might initially fail a math problem but correct its answer after reviewing its own output and reasoning.</p>
</div>



<p>Several studies have observed this process, also known as “self-critique,” “self-refine,” or “self-improve.”</p>



<p>However, the effectiveness of self-correction is not universal across all tasks. The paper from DeepMind and University of Illinois reveals that the success of self-correction is largely contingent on the nature of the task at hand. In reasoning tasks, self-correction techniques typically succeed only when they can leverage external sources, such as human feedback, an external tool like a calculator or code executor, or a knowledge base.</p>



<p>The researchers underscore the fact that high-quality feedback is not always accessible in many applications. This makes it crucial to understand the inherent capabilities of LLMs and to discern how much of the self-correction can be attributed to the model’s internal knowledge. They introduce the concept of “intrinsic self-correction,” which refers to a scenario where the model attempts to correct its initial responses based solely on its built-in capabilities, without any external feedback.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Testing self-correction on reasoning tasks</h2>



<p>The researchers put self-correction to the test on several benchmarks that measure model performance in solving math word problems, answering multiple-choice questions, and tackling question-answering problems that require reasoning. They employed a three-step process for self-correction. First, they prompt the model for an answer. Next, they prompt it to review its previous response. Finally, they prompt it a third time to answer the original question based on its self-generated feedback.</p>



<p>Their findings reveal that self-correction works effectively when the models have access to the ground-truth labels included in the benchmark datasets. This is because the algorithm can accurately determine when to halt the reasoning process and avoid changing the answer when it is already correct. As the researchers state, “These results use ground-truth labels to prevent the model from altering a correct answer to an incorrect one. However, determining how to prevent such mischanges is, in fact, the key to ensuring the success of self-correction.”</p>



<p>However, this assumption does not reflect real-world scenarios, where access to the ground truth is not always available. If the ground truth were readily accessible, there would be no need to employ a machine learning model to predict it. The researchers demonstrate that when they remove the labels from the self-correction process, the performance of the models begins to decline significantly.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the models often produce the correct answer initially, but switch to an incorrect response after self-correction. For instance, in GPT-3.5-Turbo (the model used in the free version of <a href="https://bdtechtalks.com/2022/12/05/openai-chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>), the performance dropped by almost half on the CommonSenseQA question-answering dataset when self-correction was applied. <a href="https://bdtechtalks.com/2023/03/20/gpt-4-applications-limits/">GPT-4</a> also exhibited a performance drop, albeit by a smaller margin.</p>

<p>According to the researchers, if the model is well-aligned and paired with a thoughtfully designed initial prompt, “the initial response should already be optimal given the conditions of the prompt and the specific decoding algorithm.” In this case, introducing feedback can be viewed as adding an additional prompt, potentially skewing the model’s response away from the optimal prompt. “In an intrinsic self-correction setting, on the reasoning tasks, this supplementary prompt may not offer any extra advantage for answering the question. In fact, it might even bias the model away from producing an optimal response to the initial prompt, resulting in a decrease in performance,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>Self-correction is also prevalent in multi-agent LLM applications. In these scenarios, multiple instances of an LLM, such as ChatGPT, are given different instructions to perform distinct roles in a multi-sided debate. For instance, one agent might be tasked with generating code, while another is instructed to review the code for errors.</p>



<p>In these applications, self-correction is implemented by instructing agents to critique each other’s responses. However, the researchers found that this multi-agent critique does not lead to any form of improvement through debate. Instead, it results in a form of “self-consistency,” where the different agents generate multiple responses and then engage in a form of majority voting to select an answer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Rather than labeling the multi-agent debate as a form of “debate” or “critique”, it is more appropriate to perceive it as a means to achieve “consistency” across multiple model generations,” the researchers write.</p>



<h2>Post-hoc vs pre-hoc prompting</h2>



<p>While self-correction may not enhance reasoning, the researchers found that it can be effective in tasks such as modifying the style of the LLM’s output or making the response safer. They refer to these tasks as “post-hoc prompting,” where the prompting is applied after the responses have been generated. They write, “Scenarios in which self-correction enhances model responses occur when it can provide valuable instruction or feedback that pre-hoc prompting cannot.”</p>



<p>Another key finding of the paper is that the improvement attributed to self-correction in certain tasks may be due to an inadequately crafted initial instruction that is outperformed by a carefully constructed feedback prompt. In such cases, incorporating the feedback into the initial instruction, referred to as the “pre-hoc prompt,” can yield better results and reduce inference costs. The researchers state, “It is meaningless to employ a well-crafted post-hoc prompt to guide the model in ‘self-correcting’ a response generated through a poorly constructed pre-hoc prompt. For a fair comparison, equal effort should be invested in both pre-hoc and post-hoc prompting.”</p>



<p>The researchers conclude by urging the community to approach the concept of self-correction with skepticism and to apply it judiciously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is imperative for researchers and practitioners to approach the concept of self-correction with a discerning perspective, acknowledging its potential and recognizing its boundaries,” the researchers write. “By doing so, we can better equip this technique to address the limitations of LLMs, steering their evolution towards enhanced accuracy and reliability.”</p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Humans can perform parkour by traversing obstacles in a highly dynamic fashion requiring precise eyemuscle coordination and movement. Getting robots to do the same task requires overcoming similar challenges. Classically, this is done by independently engineering perception, actuation, and control systems to very low tolerances. This restricts them to tightly controlled settings such as a predetermined obstacle course in labs. In contrast, humans are able to learn parkour through practice without significantly changing their underlying biology. In this paper, we take a similar approach to developing robot parkour on a small low-cost robot with imprecise actuation and a single front-facing depth camera for perception which is low-frequency, jittery, and prone to artifacts. We show how a single neural net policy operating directly from a camera image, trained in simulation with largescale RL, can overcome imprecise sensing and actuation to output highly precise control behavior end-to-end. We show our robot can perform a high jump on obstacles 2x its height, long jump across gaps 2x its length, do a handstand and run across tilted ramps, and generalize to novel obstacle courses with different physical properties.

That’s a word we hear a lot nowadays. Most of us use Netflix or YouTube daily. So much it has become part of everyone’s life, maybe too much for our own sake.</p><p id="5f2e">But people rarely stop and wonder: how does it even work? From my developer’s point of view, it’s pure madness. There’s so much data to store and pass through the network, people worldwide should be able to access it without lag or issues, and it needs to work on all devices.</p><p id="1309">I will not pretend I know how those apps work internally. They probably use concepts I never dreamed of to optimize every inch possible.</p><p id="06f6">But don’t leave just yet; there’s still a reason I’m writing this article. I want to use my direct experience working as a technical lead on a streaming solution at <a href="https://skeepers.io/fr/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Skeepers</a> to explain how we manage to produce high-quality videos and stream those videos directly onto our client’s website, just like you would watch a video on YouTube.</p><p id="1e78">I will discuss technical subjects like <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a>, <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">RabbitMQ</a>, and <a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/load-balancing/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">load balancers</a>. A basic knowledge of those topics is necessary to follow the article.</p><p id="b6c3"><em>To clarify, I’m talking about streaming as watching a video online that is not a live stream. A regular video on YouTube is still called video streaming.</em></p></div><div><h2 id="39ab">The video’s life: from upload to playback</h2><p id="a81b">I will take you on a journey from when a user uploads a video on our site to when you play it on your device and the challenges that come with it.</p><figure><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jakobowens1?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Jakob Owens</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="6549">First step: Video upload</h2><p id="cfac">Alright, the first step is when the video is uploaded. We have yet to determine what format, codec, or even which resolution the video will be.</p><p id="c6cd">First, it will be normalized, which means we will transform all the videos in the same format (first mp4), <a href="https://github.com/georgmartius/vid.stab" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">stabilize the video</a>, and <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#loudnorm" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">harmonize the sound</a> to mitigate shaking or loud sounds.</p><p id="4c80">We then break the video into multiple small chunks; the resulting format will be an adaptive bitrate streaming format called MPEG-Dash or HLS.</p><p id="ae70"><em>You can read more about Adaptative bitrate streaming here.</em></p><p id="d519">This task is time-consuming, so the user cannot just wait for the API’s response synchronously. It needs to be asynchronous.</p><figure><figcaption>Custom-made schema representing the simplified architecture.</figcaption></figure><p id="0444">You can see the asynchronous implementation using RabbitMQ on this schema. When a user uploads a new video, it first gets uploaded to a cloud storage. We use Google Cloud Storage, but it could be any storage. Once the upload finishes, we create a processing task in the database and send the task ID to the queue. The user screens update with a message that says the processing is ongoing and please wait a few minutes.</p><p id="0401">A NodeJS worker is constantly polling the queue, waiting for new tasks like a good soldier. When a new one is available, it gets the processing task information from the database. It uses <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">FFmpeg</a> under the hood to do the required job (normalization or adaptative bitrate streaming format creation, for example), store the resulting files in storage, and update the task’s status in the database.</p><p id="96b6">You’re probably thinking: “Hang on, there’s <strong>Kubernetes </strong>in your article title but not in the schema”, or “It’s not scalable as is. If there are a lot of videos, it will crash.”</p><p id="fe39">I’m getting there! The schema I presented was just an introduction. I am gradually introducing each concept.</p><p id="0e6c">There are indeed a couple of issues here. If there is only one API and one worker, it will quickly overload. Primarily since FFmpeg requires a lot of resources. Let’s<strong> spice it up!</strong></p><figure><figcaption>Custom-made schema representing the more complex architecture with Kubernetes.</figcaption></figure><p id="42ce">Alright, we introduced <strong>Kubernetes</strong> in the mix. The NodeJS API handling user calls will receive many HTTP calls with user files. So, instead of having one API instance, it’s now an unlimited number of Kubernetes pods. We have set it up to auto-scale in a way that if the RAM or CPU of the pods reaches a specific limit (70% of their capacity), it will launch a new pod for this same API.</p><p id="1eed">There is no “Kubernetes node“ reference to simplify the schema, but it can also scale across nodes. If the number of pods (<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">actually the required capacity of the pods</a>) reaches the capacity limit for the current node, it will auto-scale a new node and start launching new pods inside that node.</p><p id="843d">The load balancer in front of the API will share the HTTP calls randomly between all the existing pods to split the load.</p><p id="65a7">The worker polling the RabbitMQ is also auto-scaling, but it’s not on resources; it is scaling on the number of messages waiting in the queue. The more messages await, the faster we need to process them, so launching new workers is the way to go.</p><p id="181c">It’s much better, but we want to save costs when possible, so let me introduce <em>preemptible nodes</em>!</p><blockquote><p id="e0c7">Preemptible VMs are Compute Engine <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">VM instances</a> that are priced lower than standard VMs and provide no guarantee of availability — <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/preemptible-vms" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Google Cloud documentation</a>.</p></blockquote><figure><figcaption>Custom-made schema representing the more complex architecture with Kubernetes and preemptible nodes.</figcaption></figure><p id="7098">We want our user to have the best experience, but it’s perfectly fine for us if they don’t have access to the best video quality in adaptative bitrate streaming format right as they upload their content. It can take a few minutes for a preemptible node to be available, but they are cheaper than a normal node.</p><p id="c20f">In this new schema, we transformed our NodeJS worker with FFmpeg to what we call internally a “spawner”. It still polls the RabbitMQ queue, but instead of processing the video itself, it will launch a new Kubernetes pod in a preemptible node, and this new pod will do the processing.</p><p id="bd2e">This way is cheaper. We switched all our resource-intensive tasks in a preemptible node, so we don’t need to scale our spawner as much in a normal-priced node.</p><p id="e538">Google Cloud can kill preemptible nodes if a normal node needs the resources. We must ensure a failed task goes back to the queue and starts again by another node later.</p><blockquote><p id="6026">Terminated when Compute Engine requires the resources to run standard VMs — <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/preemptible-vms#comparison_to" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Google cloud documentation</a></p></blockquote><p id="87f2">This new setup with preemptible nodes brings more overhead in the implementation but a significant price improvement. We reached a point where we could scale vertically indefinitely.</p></div><div><h2 id="6d42">Second step: Video playback</h2><p id="7539">Alright, at this point in the process, we uploaded and transformed our user video to stream it on our site. A video could be hundreds of megabytes split into thousands of chunks.</p><p id="eeed">The video HTML tag does not support adaptative bitrate streaming formats like HLS or MPEG-Dash by default, so we must use a custom player. The two most used players to handle streaming are <a href="https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">HLS.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-player" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Skaka Player</a>. They both use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Media Source Extension</a> to be able to handle this format. <em>I won’t go into more detail about players and MSE as it’s not the goal of this article; you can read more by clicking on the link I provided.</em></p><p id="476c">To prevent loading the video files from the cloud storage each time someone tries to play the video, and therefore pay a lot of money to the cloud provider, we use a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Content Delivery Network (CDN)</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Custom schema showing the process of using a CDN</figcaption></figure><p id="3bcd">The user lands on the site to stream the video. All calls to retrieve the video go through our CDN provider, Cloudflare. A CDN will cache the content at the edges, which means if the content you are requesting is not present in their cache, it will demand it to the URL you provided.</p><p id="7437">The “edge” part means that depending on where you are in the world, it will store it in a server close to you (regionally) so that if a user in your region asks for the same content, he gets it blazingly fast. If a user from another side of the world asks for the same content, it will do the same process and store it close to that user.</p><p id="6d56">Each video chunk is a separate file, so the waiting time for the unlucky user who has to create the cache is still relatively low. Not thousands of megabytes to download at once.</p></div><div><p id="beb3">I skipped some essential parts of our architecture like micro-services, WebSockets, Redis pub/sub, or webhooks to keep the focus on Kubernetes’ auto-scaling capabilities in combination with RabbitMQ asynchronous queues. I’ll probably write another article about “communication” in our architecture soon.</p><p id="23bd">YouTube probably has an implementation that differs significantly from ours, but it’s already a good look into what a complex system with Kubernetes might look like.</p><p id="25aa">I would love to be a little mouse and peek at YouTube’s complete architecture to see how far we are from them. I might want to contact Ratatouille’s movie creator to do so; it’s a real story right?</p></div></div>]]></description>

Summer nuclear power plant northwest of Columbia.</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>This past week, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued what’s known as a preliminary “yellow’’ safety assessment, a measure of how serious an atomic safety problem is considered at a power plant. Yellow assessments are the second most serious on an NRC scale of severity.</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>The NRC, which rarely issues yellow findings, said nuclear plant operators <a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/local/environment/article279283589.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow">did not resolve cracking </a>problems from 2003 to 2022 in V.C. Summer’s diesel generator system, one of the most important backup safety systems at an atomic power plant.</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>NRC officials were not available Friday to explain their concerns with the backup diesel generator system, but an Oct. 4 enforcement letter to Dominion nuclear operations president Eric Carr said the utility violated an atomic safety standard that could result in more scrutiny of the power plant. </p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>“We are considering escalated enforcement for the apparent violation,’’ according to the letter signed by LaDonna Suggs, acting director of the NRC’s division of reactor projects.</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>That’s no surprise to one nuclear safety advocate. Yellow designations often spark additional investigation and scrutiny of atomic power plants like the one in Fairfield County, said David Lochbaum, a national expert on the inner workings of nuclear plants and NRC oversight.</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>“The NRC feels this was avoidable,’’ Lochbaum said, when asked why the agency issued a yellow finding. “There were signs of problems that were overlooked. Because of that, the problem grew to a point where the diesel generator’’ system did not work during testing.</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>“You’re supposed to find and fix problems that occur,’’ he said.</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>Since 2009, the NRC has issued seven yellow findings against the nation’s nuclear power plants, Lochbaum said, after reviewing agency records. Only a red designation is considered worse, with white and green findings less significant. The United States has nearly 100 nuclear plants.</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>The NRC’s determination is not final and is listed as an “apparent’’ violation. Dominion will have an opportunity to explain more about the diesel generator system issues, according to the NRC. Dominion spokesman Darryl Huger said the company “has implemented a plan to improve the system’s reliability.’’</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>Huger, in an email to The State, said V.C. Summer has a history of operating safely, maintaining what he said was an “exemplary’’ record. The recent NRC concern centers on a pipe that delivers fuel to one of the power plant’s two emergency diesel generators, he said. Dominion found problems after testing the piping system, according to the NRC. </p><!--]--><!--[--><p>The power company, which acquired former V.C. Summer plant owner SCE&amp;G after a failed effort to build two additional reactors at the site, plans to install thicker piping in the generator system, Huger said.</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><figure>                      <div>            <picture>                <!--[if IE 9]><video style="display: none;"><![endif]-->                <source srcset="https://www.thestate.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/cindi-ross-scoppe/wb0uqx/picture215586825/alternates/FREE_1140/ReactorsFretwellPix5x2.8" media="(min-width: 992px)">                <source srcset="https://www.thestate.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/cindi-ross-scoppe/wb0uqx/picture215586825/alternates/FREE_960/ReactorsFretwellPix5x2.8" media="(min-width: 768px)">                <source srcset="https://www.thestate.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/cindi-ross-scoppe/wb0uqx/picture215586825/alternates/FREE_768/ReactorsFretwellPix5x2.8" media="(min-width: 601px)">                <source srcset="https://www.thestate.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/cindi-ross-scoppe/wb0uqx/picture215586825/alternates/FREE_640/ReactorsFretwellPix5x2.8" media="(min-width: 441px)">                <source srcset="https://www.thestate.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/cindi-ross-scoppe/wb0uqx/picture215586825/alternates/FREE_480/ReactorsFretwellPix5x2.8" media="(min-width: 320px)">                <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]-->                                <img srcset="https://www.thestate.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/cindi-ross-scoppe/wb0uqx/picture215586825/alternates/FREE_1140/ReactorsFretwellPix5x2.8" alt="V.C.

If power is lost, the nuclear fuel can melt, causing radiation to be released into the surrounding community.</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>In this case, officials at the V.C. Summer plant learned about cracks in fuel pipes in the facility’s diesel generator system in 2003. Utility workers fixed the initial crack, as well as other cracks four different times in the years after the initial work was done. </p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>But the NRC says the utility never adequately assessed what could be done to make sure the diesel piping system did not experience more cracking. The most recent cracks were identified in November 2022 during a 24-hour test of the system. Workers found a small leak on one of two diesel generator systems. The leak increased over time and workers discovered a 140-degree crack around a pipe, records show.</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>The cracking occurred mostly in the power plant’s “A” diesel generator system, although one problem occurred in the plant’s “B” generator system. The plant has two backup diesel generators. </p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>The cracking that led to the yellow safety finding follows separate, electrical problems with the plant’s diesel generator system in 2022. The NRC said the company, in that case, also <a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/local/environment/article268772222.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow">failed to promptly resolve</a> problems, issuing a white finding last year. White is lower in safety significant than yellow, but still considered notable.</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>Tom Clements, a long-time nuclear safety advocate, said the NRC’s recent yellow safety assessment reveals a violation “too egregious to ignore.’’ He called for a “severe monetary fine’’ against Dominion, which he said ignored preventative maintenance through the years.</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>Dominion’s problems are noteworthy in light of the company’s recent request to renew its V.C. Summer operating license another 40 years, Clements said. The power plant, which cranked up operations in the early 1980s, is about 25 miles northwest of Columbia in rural Fairfield County.</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>“Hopefully, serious safety problems don’t lurk in other reactor safety systems at the reactor,’’ Clements said in an email to The State. “This incident serves as a wake-up call to fully analyze all such systems prior to a license-renewal determination.’’</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><figure>                      <div>            <picture>                <!--[if IE 9]><video style="display: none;"><![endif]-->                <source srcset="https://www.thestate.com/latest-news/7jilfu/picture279284539/alternates/FREE_1140/photo-plant-nuclear,%20from%20SCEG.jpg" media="(min-width: 992px)">                <source srcset="https://www.thestate.com/latest-news/7jilfu/picture279284539/alternates/FREE_960/photo-plant-nuclear,%20from%20SCEG.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)">                <source srcset="https://www.thestate.com/latest-news/7jilfu/picture279284539/alternates/FREE_768/photo-plant-nuclear,%20from%20SCEG.jpg" media="(min-width: 601px)">                <source srcset="https://www.thestate.com/latest-news/7jilfu/picture279284539/alternates/FREE_640/photo-plant-nuclear,%20from%20SCEG.jpg" media="(min-width: 441px)">                <source srcset="https://www.thestate.com/latest-news/7jilfu/picture279284539/alternates/FREE_480/photo-plant-nuclear,%20from%20SCEG.jpg" media="(min-width: 320px)">                <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]-->                                <img srcset="https://www.thestate.com/latest-news/7jilfu/picture279284539/alternates/FREE_1140/photo-plant-nuclear,%20from%20SCEG.jpg" alt="The V.C.

        <p id="blinkyblink">
          <h2>
            Don't Panic!<br>Your ram is fine!
          </h2>
        </p>
      </center>

        <h2>What's going on?</h2>
        <p>Linux is borrowing unused memory for disk caching. This makes it look like you are low on memory, but you are not! Everything is fine!</p>

        <h2>Why is it doing this?</h2>
        <p>Disk caching makes the system much faster and more responsive! There are no downsides, except for confusing newbies. It does not take memory away from applications in any way, ever!</p>

        <h2>What if I want to run more applications?</h2>
        <p>If your applications want more memory, they just take back a chunk that the disk cache borrowed. Disk cache can always be given back to applications immediately! You are not low on ram!</p>

        <h2>Do I need more swap?</h2>
        <p>No, disk caching only borrows the ram that applications don't currently want. It will not use swap. If applications want more memory, they just take it back from the disk cache. They will not start swapping.</p>

        <h2>How do I stop Linux from doing this?</h2>
        <p>You can't disable disk caching. The only reason anyone ever wants to disable disk caching is because they think it takes memory away from their applications, which it doesn't! Disk cache makes applications load faster and run smoother, but it NEVER EVER takes memory away from them! Therefore, there's absolutely no reason to disable it!</p>
        <p>If, however, you find yourself needing to clear some RAM quickly to workaround another issue, like a VM misbehaving, you can force linux to nondestructively <a href="https://linux-mm.org/Drop_Caches">drop caches</a> using <code>echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches</code>.</p>

        <h2>Why does top and free say all my ram is used if it isn't?</h2>
        <p>This is just a difference in terminology. Both you and Linux agree that memory taken by applications is "used", while memory that isn't used for anything is "free".</p>
        <p>But how do you count memory that is currently used for something, but can still be made available to applications?</p>
        <p>You might count that memory as "free" and/or "available". Linux instead counts it as "used", but also "available":</p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Memory that is</th>
              <th>You'd call it</th>
              <th>Linux calls it</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>used by applications</td>
              <td>Used</td>
              <td>Used</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>used, but can be made available</td>
              <td>Free (or Available)</td>
              <td>Used (and Available)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>not used for anything</td>
              <td>Free</td>
              <td>Free</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>This "something" is (roughly) what top and free calls "buffers" and "cached". Since your and Linux's terminology differs, you might think you are low on ram when you're not.</p>

        <h2>How do I see how much free ram I really have?</h2>
        <p>To see how much ram your applications could use without swapping, run <code>free -m</code> and look at the "available" column:</p>
        <pre>  $ free -m
                total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
  Mem:           1504        1491          13           0         855      <span><strong>792</strong></span>
  Swap:          2047           6        2041
</pre>
        <p><small>(On installations from before 2016, look at "free" column in the "-/+ buffers/cache" row instead.)</small></p>
        <p>This is your answer in MiB. If you just naively look at "used" and "free", you'll think your ram is 99% full when it's really just 47%!</p>
        <p>For a more detailed and technical description of what Linux counts as "available", see <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=34e431b0ae398fc54ea69ff85ec700722c9da773">the commit that added the field</a>.</p>

        <h2>When should I start to worry?</h2>
        <p>A <strong>healthy Linux system</strong> with more than enough memory will, after running for a while, show the following expected and harmless behavior:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>free</code> memory is close to <code>0</code> </li>
          <li><code>used</code> memory is close to <code>total</code> </li>
          <li><code>available</code> memory (or "free + buffers/cache") has enough room (let's say, 20%+ of total)</li>
          <li><code>swap used</code> does not change</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Warning signs</strong> of a genuine low memory situation that you may want to look into:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>available</code> memory (or "free + buffers/cache") is close to zero</li>
          <li><code>swap used</code> increases or fluctuates</li>
          <li><code>dmesg | grep oom-killer</code> shows the OutOfMemory-killer at work</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How can I verify these things?</h2>
        <p>See <a href="https://www.linuxatemyram.com/play.html">this page</a> for more details and how you can experiment with disk cache to show the effects described here. Few things make you appreciate disk caching more than measuring an order-of-magnitude speedup on your own hardware!</p>

<p>This story has been making the rounds on the internet with a claim that you’ve probably been told during visits to castles, but, it’s not true.</p>

<p>In short the idea is that it’s easier for a soldier or right-handed knight to fight in a spiral staircase that is built clockwise when they were defending the castle as they had space to swing their weapon while the attacker would find this more difficult.</p>



<p>Like many myths that stick, the story at first makes sense.<br>So when we hear it from a guide during a castle tour, from our history teacher, or even on television documentaries, why would we doubt it?</p>



<p>But if you think about it a bit longer and start looking for evidence, you soon realise something is a bit iffy here.<br>For starters, there is no primary evidence, whatsoever, that the people who built, lived and fought in these castles built staircases in that way for that reason. During the Middle Ages, nobody wrote down that you should build staircases like this and why.<br>If it had been common knowledge among castle builders, then why are there still quite a lot (about 30%) of castles with counter-clockwise staircases?<br>And no, before you start, there’s no evidence of the Kerrs being left handed, that’s probably an 19th century (yes, them again) <a href="https://triskeleheritage.triskelepublishing.com/2023/08/15/mediaeval-mythbusting-blog-24-the-left-handed-kerrs/">myth</a>.<br>The Tower of London, one of the most important castles in England, where royalty live(d) has counter-clockwise stairs!<br>If medieval people thought this would give the defenders not an advantage, surely they would have fixed it, especially in this castle!</p>

<p>Another reason why we know this story is a myth is that it also doesn’t make a lot of sense when you study medieval combat involving castles.<br>Castle builders knew that it didn’t really make a huge difference which way the stairs go, they’re not suitable for fighting at all, neither party has a lot of space to wield those long,<br>pointy, sharp weapons.<br>The person below you has the advantage of jabbing at your legs and feet while they can protect their head with their helmet and shield.<br>Of course the only way to win would be by pushing your enemy back down the stairs and then with whoever is left above you, retake the entire castle.<br>Yeah, that’s unlikely to work out.<br>Frankly, if you find yourself in this position the castle is probably already lost.<br>A better way to stop your enemy might be to block the stairs by throwing heavy furniture and everything else you can find down it while you then wait at the top of the stairs where you have more space to fight and where your enemy really is at a disadvantage as they’re still on the stairs below you.</p>



<p>For attackers it’s also not a very tempting scenario.<br>If you’ve already breached all the outer walls and defeated all the soldiers there, who would want to risk their life crawling up some stairs where the defenders are waiting for you?<br>Sieges often didn’t involve much fighting at all, as simply waiting outside the castle till the people inside ran out of water and food was a much easier and less bloody way to win.<br>In many cases simply realising the enemy was going to sit outside and wait was enough to surrender.</p>





<p>So in conclusion: there’s no evidence for this claim and it also doesn’t make a lot of sense.<br>This, like SO MANY myths about the middle ages can very likely be <a href="https://archive.org/details/spiralsinnaturea00cook/page/144/mode/2up">credited to the Victorians</a>.<br>For more research &amp; the opinions of historians, archaeologists &amp; other experts check the sources below.</p>



<p>Stairs were used to go up and down floors, they were not dimly lit or built to be uneven on purpose as you wouldn’t want servants, soldiers but also the lords and ladies themselves falling down them all the time.<br>“Oh no Lord Dave has fallen down the stairs and broken his neck because we have no lights and dodgy steps in the tower just in case there’s a siege even though we haven’t had one in generations….”</p>



<p>And if you’re trained in medieval combat and have access to some castle stairs, please do some experimenting, try if you can fight there and make a video of it, I’ll share it here!<br>Do be careful &amp; responsible though, I won’t take responsibility for you damaging yourself or worse, the castle 😉</p>

<p>In this guide, we’ll build a very tiny Linux kernel, weighing in at 789 K, and requiring <strong>no MMU support</strong>. We’ll write some userspace code and this will be deployed on a virtual RISC-V 64-bit machine, without MMU, and we’ll run some tiny programs of our own.</p>
<p>As a reminder, please go through <a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/making-a-micro-linux-distro/">the guide for a micro Linux distro</a> to understand the concepts behind what we’re doing today: building the kernel, <code>initramfs</code>, etc. This guide is basically a continuation of that one and an exercise in making an absolutely minimal Linux deployment for (in theory) extremely cheap hardware.</p>
<p>Like before, there’s very little here that is specific to RISC-V, I just want to stay consistent with my previous guides. This exercise should be easily repeatable for other architectures too (though <code>x86</code> may be somewhat sticky).</p>

<h2 id="mmu-and-linux">MMU and Linux</h2>
<p>An important piece of hardware when running an operating system is an <strong>MMU: memory management unit</strong>. This unit oversees memory accesses from a running CPU and translates them to different physical addresses. The reason why this is hugely important is because that is how the memory is <strong>virtualized</strong>, and the MMU is heavily used by the operating systems to implement a <strong>virtual address space</strong>. What this means is that the kernel typically enables the applications to not worry about how other running applications occupy the memory on a machine. Each process has an illusion of complete ownership of the memory, and the kernel facilitates that by virtualizing the memory. In other words, 2 processes on the same machine may use a memory location <code>0x12345678</code> and what they’d really be hitting inside the physical memory could be locations <code>0xAABBCCDD</code> and <code>0xDDCCBBAA</code>, respectively. The MMU, once set up by the kernel, will route the <code>0x12345678</code> accesses from each one of these applications to the relevant end physical address.</p>
<p>Your typical Linux build virtualizes the address space and uses the MMU for this, and while we didn’t explicitly set it in <a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/making-a-micro-linux-distro/">the previous guide</a>, MMU was used and the memory contents of one process were insulated from the other processes.</p>
<p>Now, as useful as MMU is, not all machines have it. The super simple budget-friendly microcontrollers typically do not have it, and the memory addresses coming out of the program running are actually what is used to access the memory. In this case, if a process accesses <code>0x12345678</code>, it will go to the address <code>0x12345678</code> indeed.</p>
<h3 id="brief-history-of-uclinux">Brief history of uClinux</h3>
<p>As Linux has been rising in popularity since its inception, there have been attempts to run it on pretty much any digital device. This includes popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller">microcontrollers</a> that do not have an MMU attached. Enter <strong>uClinux</strong>.</p>
<p>The proper name for uClinux is actually μClinux, with a Greek ‘mu’, and so μC stands for ‘microcontroller’. We spell it as uClinux for ASCII-friendly simplicity.</p>
<p>The uClinux effort, per my understanding, was running independently for some time, before the decision has been made to <strong>mainline</strong> it, meaning it is now part of the Linux source code itself. Basically, what this means for us is that uClinux is now a set of configurations in the kernel build config, and we’ll get our MMU-less build easily.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-with-mmu-less-linux">Challenges with MMU-less Linux</h2>
<p>Before we get our hands dirty, I would like to highlight a few challenges with running Linux in this way. I will from this point refer to our Linux as MMU-less Linux, rather than uClinux to avoid confusion with the old project that has since been mainlined.</p>
<h3 id="executable-file-format">Executable file format</h3>
<p>First, ELF binaries will not work anymore. I have not been able to build a MMU-less flavor of Linux for ELF, and I strongly believe it is impossible. I’m not sure if something about the ELF format explicitly assumes a virtual address space necessarily, I don’t think it does, but it just seems impossible to load an ELF binary for running.</p>
<p>What MMU-less Linux likes are the <strong>bFLT</strong> binaries. FLT stands for <em>flat</em>, and this initially made me believe that there really is no file format here, that we’re supposed to just dump the machine instructions into a bare file, but this really isn’t the case. bFLT has some structure, which is far simpler than ELF, but it’s structured nonetheless. I personally found it very difficult to find any good documentation on what this file format really looks like, and really the only useful page I have found on the Internet around it is <a href="https://myembeddeddev.blogspot.com/2010/02/uclinux-flat-file-format.html">this page</a> from someone’s personal blog. It’s a bit interesting to think that if this blog goes offline, there really isn’t anything out there left except the actual source code in the Linux codebase, and I’m sure you agree that’s not the most elegant way to learn.</p>
<h3 id="pointers-are-dangerous-obviously">Pointers are dangerous (obviously!)</h3>
<p>It should be obvious, but I’ll still call it out — MMU is not routing our memory accesses now; whatever we access is really what we hit in the physical memory and this means that bad pointers are now very dangerous. You could easily corrupt the memory contents of another process or even the kernel itself.</p>
<p>This would be a great place to introduce something like Rust programming, but given that it was tricky to build bare C programs for this kind of a platform (more about it below), I would now just say it’s too early for that.</p>
<h3 id="vfork-instead-of-fork"><code>vfork</code> instead of <code>fork</code></h3>
<p>The <code>fork</code> system call does not work on an MMU-less Linux since that heavily depends on virtualizing the memory, and this may lead some people to believe that you can run only one process on a MMU-less Linux, but that is not correct, and we will show it later — multiprocessing is definitely possible.</p>
<p>The way you achieve multiprocessing is by simply using <code>vfork</code> instead of <code>fork</code>. I’ll keep things simple here and say that the difference between <code>vfork</code> and <code>fork</code> is that the parent process is sleeping until the child exits or calls <code>execve</code>. Please note that unless you <code>exec</code> into another binary from the child process, the child is running in <strong>the same memory space</strong>. Again, there is no MMU to help us out here.</p>
<h2 id="building-binaries-for-an-mmu-less-kernel">Building binaries for an MMU-less kernel</h2>
<p>As we mentioned before, we need to build bFLT binaries rather than ELFs. Figuring out how to exactly do this is what took most of my time in this exercise.</p>
<p>I’ll skip a lot of details and give you the end result, and I’m sure if you dig around why this is the end result, you’ll be able to quickly figure out what’s going on. Here it is: <strong>the simplest way to build bFLT binaries is with a uClibc toolchain</strong>.</p>
<p><code>uClibc</code> is basically a very slimmed down version of the C standard library, suitable for embedded systems. Of course, nothing is stopping you from using it outside of this context, for example, in a full blown desktop Linux distrbution.</p>
<p>Quick note: which flavor of the standard C library is the best is another frequent topic of debate.</p>
<h3 id="getting-the-toolchain">Getting the toolchain</h3>
<p>I strongly suggest building the <code>uClibc</code> toolchain from source. It’s very easy, since it is based on Buildroot.</p>
<p>Therefore, let’s head over to the <a href="https://buildroot.org/download.html">Buildroot download page</a>, fetch the latest release and unpack it. You can <code>cd</code> into the unpacked directory.</p>
<p>tl;dr on what Buildroot is: it is a massive collection of <code>Makefile</code>s that is typically used to build a Linux distribution for an embedded system. You can use it to drive the kernel download + build as well, though I personally prefer to do it separately. What I typically use Buildroot for is to fetch the sources of common tools and build the <code>initramfs</code> <code>cpio</code> archive containing them. If you don’t know what this means, please check the <a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/making-a-micro-linux-distro/">previous guide on making a micro Linux distro</a>. You configure the Buildroot flow almost the same as you configure the Linux kernel build flow: you run <code>make menuconfig</code>, toggle a bunch of options and you’re good to go. Buildroot is great because it has the scripts to pull and build a super wide range of common Linux tools and applications: <code>busybox</code>, <code>ip</code>, <code>vi</code>, <code>python</code>, <code>Xorg server</code> you name it.</p>
<p>Sadly, this is as much as the <a href="https://www.uclibc.org/toolchains.html">uClibc toolchain page</a> says. Personally, I was a bit puzzled after reading it: how do I use the toolchain and how do I build the binaries for <code>uClinux</code>? I’ll cover that part right now.</p>
<h3 id="building-the-toolchain">Building the toolchain</h3>
<p>Now that you have Buildroot downloaded, you can build the <code>uClibc</code> toolchain, which basically means you’ll have a GCC set of tools to compile with against it. I was always under the impression that changing which standard library you want is a matter of just providing a different standard library to any GCC compiler, but after some digging online, my understanding now is that the GCC needs to be specifically compiled against it somehow. It’s a bit beyond my understanding at the moment, to be perfectly honest.</p>
<ol>
<li>As mentioned above, you can do <code>make menuconfig</code> from your unpacked Buildroot directory.</li>
<li>Go to <code>Target options</code>, and select <code>RISCV</code> as the architecture.</li>
<li><code>Target architecture size</code> should be 64-bit.</li>
<li><strong>Unselect the MMU support</strong> option.</li>
<li><code>Target Binary Format</code> should be <strong>FLAT</strong>.</li>
<li><code>Target ABI</code> is fine as <code>lp64d</code>.</li>
<li>Go back to the main menu and head over to the <code>Toolchain</code> section.</li>
<li>C library should be <code>uClibc-ng</code>.</li>
<li>Select <code>Compile and install uClibc utilities</code>.</li>
<li>Save and exit.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should be all set up to build the toolchain. From the Buildroot directory, run the following:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>make sdk</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This could take a while. Once it’s done, you should have your new toolchain under <code>output/host/bin/</code> within the Buildroot directory. Go ahead and <code>ls</code> that directory and you’ll see a bunch of stuff built in there, including your well known GCC tools. All we’ll be using is <code>riscv64-buildroot-linux-uclibc-gcc</code>, so make sure you hold on to that one.</p>
<h3 id="building-bflt-files">Building bFLT files</h3>
<p>bFLT files are, per my understanding, derived from the ELF files, actually. You use your GCC to get an ELF file, and then you use a tool called <code>elf2flt</code> to construct the bFLT file.</p>
<p>I have tried building <code>elf2flt</code> from source and using it, but I had a hard time getting the build to work in the first place. After many attempts, I gave up, but I was happy to realize that Buildroot provides <code>elf2flt</code>. In fact, when you <code>ls</code>‘ed the directory for your toolchain just a minute ago, you could see something like <code>riscv64-buildroot-linux-uclibc-elf2flt</code> in that directory. Once I realized this, I thought it was easy and I could just build a regular RISC-V ELF and convert it to bFLT with this tool — turns out it’s not that straightforward.</p>
<p>I lost hope I’d ever get this done, and then I tried having Buildroot build the whole <code>initramfs</code> for me. I was skeptical it would run properly with the MMU-less Linux, but it did, so that means there really is a way to do this properly and quickly. My hack was to look at the Buildroot logs for how it built some of the packages an observe what are the GCC flags it uses.</p>
<p>It turns out that I was missing the linker flag <code>-Wl,-elf2flt=-r</code> to make things work. This makes sure that the <code>elf2flt</code> is involved during the linking process and in the end, I got my bFLT file. I never had to run <code>elf2flt</code> myself. We’ll see a concrete detailed example later as we build a sample application.</p>
<p>First, let’s build a MMU-less kernel that we have something to run against.</p>
<h2 id="building-an-extremely-tiny-linux-kernel">Building an extremely tiny Linux kernel</h2>
<p>As this is an exercise in minimalism, we’ll build an extremely minimal Linux kernel. It will offer little more than a basic filesystem and running binaries on top of the kernel.</p>
<p><em>At this point, I assume you know how to build a Linux kernel in general. If you don’t, please look at the <a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/making-a-micro-linux-distro/">micro Linux distro guide</a> and familiarize yourself with the basic concepts before proceeding.</em></p>
<p>For simplicity, I’ll simply get the <code>tar</code> file from <code>kernel.org</code> for stable version <code>6.5.5</code>, though I believe if you see something newer as the latest, you can just go for it and nothing should change. Let’s download and unpack that.</p>
<p><strong>Here and below: my <code>CROSS_COMPILE</code> prefix may be different from what you need on your machine to invoke the build tools.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s begin by setting up a super minimal Linux configuration:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- tinyconfig</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This <code>tinyconfig</code> really strips down the build to the most basic things. It doesn’t even have <code>printk</code> support, so you won’t be getting a whole lot of output by booting this. More accurately, it doesn’t even have the TTY support, so you really can’t even output anything through the standard methods like <code>printk</code>, and you wouldn’t be able to display something through UART or otherwise via standard output in the user space.</p>
<p>Let’s, however, build this (I run <code>make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- -j16</code>) and see what we get out of it. I’m getting the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>arch/riscv/boot/Image</code> weighs in at 943 K.</li>
<li><code>arch/riscv/boot/Image.gz</code> weighs in at 559 K.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is good to know and we’ll use it as the baseline as we make the changes. Let’s do the following and make some changes to our build:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- menuconfig</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The most important change we want to make is we want to disable the MMU facilities in the kernel. I’ve seen guides that say you can just drop a config line into the <code>.config</code> file because they don’t see the option to disable the MMU from <code>menuconfig</code>, but I would advise against it. I was able to get the option to appear, and I’m not sure if what they’re expericing is architecture specific, but for RISC-V, I was definitely able to get the option to disable the MMU stuff.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>CONFIG_NONPORTABLE</code> should be set to <code>y</code>. We are building for a specific machine and we want to enable non-portable builds as we know exactly what are the memory addresses we’d be deploying to.</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_MMU</code>: <code>n</code>. It should be obvious what this does. Note, we were unable to flip this to <code>n</code> before doing the step 1; we should be all good now.</li>
<li><code>PHYS_RAM_BASE_FIXED</code>: <code>y</code>. This means we’ll be deploying the kernel to a specific address in the memory.</li>
<li>Once you flip that, you can set <code>CONFIG_PHYS_RAM_BASE</code> to <code>0x80000000</code>. This makes perfect sense for us as this is where our execution will begin on the QEMU virtual machine. If you want to know more about it, please read the <a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/bare-metal-programming-risc-v/">bare metal guide</a> and the <a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/risc-v-sbi-and-full-boot-process/">SBI and boot process guide</a>. Those guides are lengthy, but they will enable you to fully understand what’s going on. That said, for the latter guide, please note that <strong>we are not</strong> using OpenSBI to boot here. We’re running a very light Linux, and we are not relying on the SBI infrastructure. This is much closer to bare metal programming than running Linux as you’re used to it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s build this really quick and see if there are any changes. Save and exit, and run:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- -j16</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Let’s weigh our kernel again:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>arch/riscv/boot/Image</code> weighs in at 789 K.</li>
<li><code>arch/riscv/boot/Image.gz</code> weighs in at 472 K.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wow, it’s significantly lighter! However, even though we disabled the MMU smartness from it, we still haven’t enabled any features and again, the <code>tinyconfig</code> is so tiny that it barely does anything. Let’s flip some more configurations:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD</code>: <code>y</code>. We need an <code>initramfs</code> image to be able to run our <code>init</code> process and start off some magic in the user space. Flip that to <code>y</code>.</li>
<li>The above will by default enable various compression support for the <code>initramfs</code>, but you can go ahead and disable them all. I will not list out all of them one by one (a single example is <code>CONFIG_RD_GZIP</code>), they should expand in <code>menuconfig</code> as <code>y</code> right under the option for enabling <code>initramfs</code>. You can flip them all to <code>n</code>, we don’t want to beef up our kernel image with compression algorithms now.</li>
<li><code>CONFIG_BINFMT_FLAT</code>: <code>y</code>. We need to add support for bFLT binaries. If you look at the same menu, there’s no mention of ELF: as soon as you disabled the MMU support, you lost the ELF binary support as well. We already knew this, so it’s not an issue, and as promised, we’ll talk about how to build bFLTs below on a concrete example. Let’s save and exit and build again:</li>
</ol>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>make ARCH=riscv CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- -j16</span></span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>arch/riscv/boot/Image</code> weighs in at 789 K.</li>
<li><code>arch/riscv/boot/Image.gz</code> weighs in at 476 K.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only difference from the previous step is that the compressed image is slightly thicker, but it’s still tiny!</p>
<p>At this point, we have what we need to run an <code>init</code> process in user space!</p>
<h2 id="building-an-initramfs-image-for-the-tiny-mmu-less-kernel">Building an <code>initramfs</code> image for the tiny MMU-less kernel</h2>
<p>We’ll have a useless <code>init</code> that prints a message to UART and just goes to sleep. Notice an inconsistency? I said we’ll print to UART, but our <code>tinyconfig</code> has no UART drivers, no TTY, nothing. So how could this possibly work? Well, since we’re without an MMU, we can really target any physical address on the system. If you go through the <a href="https://popovicu.com/posts/bare-metal-programming-risc-v/">bare metal guide</a>, you’ll learn that the QEMU system we’ll be using to run this image has an UART device mapped out at <code>0x10000000</code>. We’ll be printing to UART through this address for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most importantly, to illustrate that on MMU-less kernel you can access any physical address. This can be both good and bad, probably more bad and not only in terms of stability and being resilient to bugs, but also in terms of security if your system accepts any sort of user input.</li>
<li>We want to achieve extreme minimalism here in terms of the size of the build and see how far we can push the boundaries on how much we can slim the kernel down. Right now, it’s under 800 K, which is pretty cool. Bringing in drivers for TTY, UART, etc. would certaily add some weight to the size of our image.</li>
</ol>
<p>That said, here’s our C program:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>#include</span><span> </span><span>&lt;string.h&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>#include</span><span> </span><span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>    </span><span>*</span><span>UART </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>message</span><span>[i];</span></span>
<span><span>  }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>print_to_uart</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello world! Welcome to the Tiny Linux MMU-less kernel!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>while</span><span> (</span><span>1</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1000</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>  }</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Notice that we have an infinite loop: the <code>init</code> process is not supposed to ever really exit or the kernel falls into a panic (not that you would see it without <code>printk</code>, though).</p>
<p>Now is the time to compile this <code>init</code> to a bFLT file. This is where we’ll invoke the <code>uClibc</code> toolchain we had previously built. I run the following on my machine, and you only need to adjust the relevant paths to reproduce:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>uros@uros-debian-desktop:/tmp/tiny/init$ /tmp/buildroot/buildroot-2023.02.5/output/host/bin/riscv64-buildroot-linux-uclibc-gcc -fPIC -Wl,-elf2flt=-r -Wall -static -o init init.c</span></span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>-fPIC</code> is used to produce <strong>position independent code</strong>. This is crucial for understanding how bFLT binaries work on an MMU-less Linux. Since we’re directly going for the physical addresses, but we don’t know where exactly in memory our binary would be loaded, we can’t depend on any absolute address in our binary. If we did, we risk (and most likely will) hurting the memory of another process or the kernel itself. We simply can’t make any assumptions about the end memory addresses. Therefore, everything needs to be PC-relative in our code. If you don’t know what this means, please look this up online as it’s extremely important. tl;dr is that every memory access must be made with an offset relative to the CPU’s pointer to the current machine instruction, instead of accessing a hardcoded address. In other words, instead of accessing <code>0x1001</code> directly, we access with an offset of <code>1</code> if our program counter is at <code>0x1000</code>. This will still work if the binary loader places us at <code>0x2000</code> instead of <code>0x1000</code>; the former wouldn’t! Again, if you do not understand this concept, please review CPU addressing modes.</li>
<li><code>-Wl,-elf2flt=-r</code> is the magic flag we really needed from the toolchain. This ensures that <code>elf2flt</code> is invoked and that the end binary is able to relocate, meaning the loader can place it somewhere differently in memory and the binary should still work (owing to the <code>-fPIC</code> flag as well).</li>
<li>The rest of the flags should be familiar.</li>
</ul>
<p>This binary weighs in at onl 3.3 K, which is pretty light, especially for a statically linked binary. <code>uClibc</code> delivered on its promise of being light. Quick note here is that <code>elf2flt</code> also dropped a file called <code>init.gdb</code> which is an ELF file that you can use to do your <code>objdump</code> and whatnot with it to debug.</p>
<p>If you run <code>file init</code>, you should see something like this:</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>init: BFLT executable - version 4 ram gotpic</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This is what we needed. Let’s make a file called <code>file_list.txt</code> with a single line saying <code>init</code> and let’s make the <code>initramfs</code> image for this setup.</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>cpio -o -H newc &lt; file_list.txt &gt; initramfs.cpio</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Now that we have the kernel image and the <code>initramfs.cpio</code> file, we can fire this up in QEMU and see what we get.</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>uros@uros-debian-desktop:/tmp/linux/linux-6.5.5$ qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -cpu rv64,mmu=false -kernel /tmp/tiny/linux-6.5.5/arch/riscv/boot/Image -bios none -initrd /tmp/tiny/init/initramfs.cpio -nographic</span></span>
<span><span>Hello world! Welcome to the Tiny Linux MMU-less kernel!</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Awesome, we ran userspace code and even depended on a dangerous pointer to do something useful.</p>
<h2 id="slightly-more-complicated-build-verifying-system-calls-and-multiprocessing">Slightly more complicated build: verifying system calls and multiprocessing</h2>
<p>Instead of starting from a <code>tinyconfig</code> and working my way up, this time I start with the typical <code>defconfig</code>. From that point, I disabled a bunch of things like MMU (of course), networking, virtualization, etc. while retaining TTY, UART drivers and other useful goodies. Of course, nothing stops you from beginning with <code>tinyconfig</code> and adding incrementally, I just wanted to save myself some time. This time I ended up with images of these sizes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>arch/riscv/boot/Image</code> weighs in at 4.1 M.</li>
<li><code>arch/riscv/boot/Image.gz</code> weighs in at 2.1 M.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all much heavier than previously, but it comes with a bunch of cool features like ability to dump core, UART drivers, filesystem support, etc. The message I’m trying to send here is that kernel is full of amazing drivers and features that you can start taking advantage of by only adjusting your kernel build configuration. I ran the same <code>initramfs</code> image as above, and got much richer output with a lot of debug messages from the kernel:</p>

<p>Hopefully this clears up the confusion about whether multiprocessing is possible on a no-MMU kernel build. Additionally, we verified that the system calls work properly.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We managed to build a very light Linux kernel for a system without an MMU. By building a custom <code>uClibc</code> toolchain we also managed to build bFLT binaries to run in the userspace. System calls and multiprocessing worked well and so we have a fully functional system.</p>
<p>We pushed the boundaries of a lightweight deployment through <code>tinyconfig</code>, and ended up running a userspace process that writes to UART by directly writing to the UART device, bypassing the kernel.</p>
<p>If all we want is to multi-task a bit on our device, Linux is likely an overkill, even in a tiny deployment like this. Additionally, if we’re not leveraging any drivers from the kernel code base, it’s probably another indicator we’re going too heavy. I leave it to you to decide if this lightweight Linux deployment makes sense for your usecase or not.</p>
<p>We could use Buildroot to add some of the well known tools to our system, potentially even make something interactive. I’ll stop here, however, as my goal was to bring up the absolutely minimal set up. Please connect with me and let me know if there is a way to make the set up I described above even lighter from the <code>tinyconfig</code>-based one.</p>
<p>I think this finally answers my question that I’ve had for a long time which is: what is the absolutely minimal Linux kernel? Something that runs on a single core, extremely simple, with as little cruft as possible, but that can still process some system calls and provide some sort of a filesystem. If anyone has been looking for this answer as well, I hope I am providing it correctly here.</p>
<p>The way I initially got to this question was I wanted to implement a minimal machine (in simulation or otherwise in FPGA) that can run something useful like some sort of a minimal Linux, and that I can program with at least some standard tooling like GCC. After studying my options, I think RISC-V and Linux are the answer, and the last few guides I have written are the summary of my studies.</p>
<h2 id="github-repo">GitHub repo</h2>
<p>As always, I’ll be posting the code from above to GitHub as well. There won’t be <code>Makefile</code>s due to the need for a custom toolchain, and I’d really like the readers to go through this writeup and understand what’s going on exactly in order to build bFLT libraries. It stumped me for a few days and I hope this helps anyone with the same questions. The repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/popovicu/linux-no-mmu-userspace-example">here</a>.</p>

Fortunately, he was a stubborn man. Jobs immediately started the company NeXT, with the idea of taking on IBM once again.</p><p>As he developed the NeXT computer, which would launch in 1988, Jobs was looking for killer software programs to create demand for the product. From his experience at Apple, he knew that a good spreadsheet program could drive sales.

The organization had already developed Lotus 1-2-3, a popular spreadsheet program that ran on IBM computers. It was in these meetings that Jobs would first stumble upon the “pivot table.”</p><p>Software developer Pito Salas was at the time working in research and development for Lotus, looking into how people typically utilize spreadsheets. Salas saw that users would often use spreadsheets to try to calculate summary statistics by categories (often referred to as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.displayr.com/what-is-a-crosstab/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.displayr.com/what-is-a-crosstab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crosstabs</a></span>). For example, a company selling bicycles might want to examine their data to find unit sales by month or revenue by country. The way people did that at the time was cumbersome and error-prone because it involved writing complicated formulas.</p><p>Salas decided the world needed software that would make those calculations simple. Rather than enter formulas, users would be able to point and click to get those summary statistics. The Lotus team called this tool “flexible views,” but today similar tools are called “pivot tables” in both Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.</p><p>The Lotus team showed Jobs an early prototype. “Steve Jobs thought it was the coolest thing ever,” Salas, now a professor at Brandeis University, tells Quartz. Jobs then convinced Lotus to develop the pivot table software exclusively for the NeXT computer.

    <p>The Chapel developer community is excited to announce the release of
Chapel version 1.32!  To obtain a copy, please refer to the
<a href="https://chapel-lang.org/download.html">Downloading Chapel</a> page on
the Chapel website.</p>
<h3 id="highlights-of-chapel-132">Highlights of Chapel 1.32</h3>
<h4 id="chapel-20-release-candidate">Chapel 2.0 Release Candidate</h4>
<p>The main highlight of Chapel 1.32 is that it is a release candidate
for our forthcoming Chapel 2.0 release!  If you’re not familiar with
the concept of Chapel 2.0, it is intended to be a release that
declares a core subset of the language and library features as
‘stable’.  These features are ones that we intend to support in
their current form going forward, such that code relying on them
will not break across releases.  Meanwhile, other features will be
considered ‘unstable’, implying that they are ones where we are
still learning from user experiences and refining interfaces before
considering them to be stabilized.  Unstable features may continue
evolving after the 2.0 release, either by improving them until they
too are stable, or replacing them with other, more stable features.</p>
<p>Chapel 1.32 being a 2.0 release candidate means that this is a key
time for Chapel users to give us feedback about aspects of our
design that they would like to see change prior to the 2.0 release.
Users may also want to compile their programs with the
<code>--warn-unstable</code> flag in order to identify any unstable features
that they are currently relying upon.  Reliance on such features
could motivate you to advocate for stabilizing those features sooner,
or you could simply view it as an opportunity to be aware that those
features may continue to evolve over time.  We are generally

<p>As part of the team’s push to make this a worthy Chapel 2.0 release
candidate, Chapel 1.32 contains a large number of improvements to
the language, compiler, and libraries.  Some of these changes
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>new warnings to encourage a programming style in which generic
types are more clearly visible in a program’s source code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a change in the default intent for arrays and record receivers
(i.e., <code>this</code>) to <code>const</code> for greater uniformity with other types</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>revised definitions of the compiler’s interpretation of <code>const</code>
intents and default return/yield intents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>significant improvements to ranges, domains, and distributions,
including converting distribution types to records, obviating the
need for the <code>dmap</code> type</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>major improvements to the <code>IO</code>, <code>Math</code>, <code>BigInteger</code>, and <code>Time</code>
modules, including a new IO serialization framework for specifying
how to read and write types to files orthogonally from the file’s
format (see <a href="#io-serialization-framework">below</a> for more detail)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="gpu-improvements">GPU Improvements</h4>
<p>Version 1.32 includes significant improvements to Chapel’s support
for vendor-neutral GPU programming, both in terms of performance and
capabilities.</p>
<p>Key performance improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>compiler optimizations to reduce the number of pointer
dereferences when accessing arrays within GPU kernels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>switching the default memory allocation scheme for arrays to
‘array_on_device’ mode, in which an array’s data is stored
directly on the GPU rather than in managed memory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a reduction in overheads when invoking math routines within GPU
kernels by eliminating unnecessary boilerplate wrapper code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using per-task GPU streams, which can enable
communication-computation overlap to improve performance</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The non-trivial impact of these optimizations can be seen in the
following graphs, which show the improvements that have occurred in
a Chapel port of the SHOC Sort benchmark on both NVIDIA and AMD
GPUs.  Note that the second graph includes data transfer times while
the first does not.</p>
<figure><img src="https://chapel-lang.org/blog/posts/announcing-chapel-1.32/SHOC-sort-combined.png">
</figure>

<p>Chapel’s support for AMD effectively reaches feature parity with
NVIDIA in this release, largely due to the addition of a number of
math routines that had not been supported for AMD in
Chapel&nbsp;1.31.  In addition, the Chapel compiler’s <code>--savec</code> flag
can now be used to inspect the assembly code generated when
targeting AMD GPUs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when targeting NVIDIA GPUs, Chapel 1.32 adds support for
generating multi-architecture binaries by setting <code>CHPL_GPU_ARCH</code> to
a comma-separated list of target architectures.</p>
<p>See the latest <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.32/technotes/gpu.html">GPU
Programming</a>
technical note for additional details about these changes and
Chapel’s overall support for GPUs in 1.32.</p>
<h4 id="support-for-co-locales">Support for Co-Locales</h4>
<p>Since its inception, Chapel has preferred to represent each compute
node as a single top-level locale, using multitasking to implement
any intra-node parallelism.  This approach has been beneficial in
many problem domains where running a process per core could result
in larger memory requirements or poor surface-to-volume effects due
to the amount of <span>
<label for="SPMD definition">SPMD</label>

<span>
<span>[note:</span>
SPMD = Single Program, Multiple Data, a static and coarse-grained
style of parallelism in which multiple copies of the same program
are executed, e.g. one per processor core 
<span>]</span>
</span>
</span>

parallelism.</p>
<p>However, as modern compute nodes have begun to support multiple <span>
<label for="NIC definition">NICs,</label>

<span>
<span>[note:</span>
NICs = Network Interface
Chips, which permit processes to communicate with remote nodes 
<span>]</span>
</span>
</span>
 this traditional approach has faced challenges.
Specifically, it is unduly complicated to have a single locale (UNIX
process) leverage multiple NICs effectively; yet using just one NIC
leaves potential performance benefits on the floor by not exercising
the network to its full capacity.</p>
<p>To address this, Chapel 1.32 introduces user-facing support for
<em>co-locales</em>, in which multiple locales can be mapped to a single
compute node.  Using co-locales can lead to performance improvements
by making better use of the network and/or reducing the number of
memory references that cross between sockets.  For example, the
following charts show improvements to a pair of benchmarks when run
using two locales per node on a dual-NIC HPE Cray EX system using
Slingshot 11:</p>
<figure><img src="https://chapel-lang.org/blog/posts/announcing-chapel-1.32/co-locales-perf.png">
</figure>

<p>Current support is limited to running a locale per socket on a given
compute node, and is also limited to certain platforms and
configurations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>HPE Cray EX platforms with Slingshot 11 when using <code>CHPL_COMM=ofi</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>InfiniBand-based systems when using <code>CHPL_COMM=gasnet</code> with
<code>CHPL_COMM_SUBSTRATE=ibv</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configurations using <code>CHPL_LAUNCHER=slurm-srun</code> or <code>pbs-gasnetrun_ibv</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To opt-in to using co-locales, specify the number of locales for your
Chapel program using a product of nodes and locales per node.  For
example, the following invocation:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>$ ./myChapelProgram -nl 8x2
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>says to run the Chapel program on 8 nodes with 2 locales per node,
for a total of 16 locales.</p>
<p>For more information on using co-locales with Chapel, please refer
to <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.32/usingchapel/multilocale.html#co-locales">the online
documentation</a>.</p>
<h4 id="io-serialization-framework">IO Serialization Framework</h4>
<p>The IO serialization framework <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/blog/posts/announcing-chapel-1.31/#prototypical-support-for-io-serializers">that was prototyped in Chapel
1.31</a>
is now used by default for calls like <code>writeln()</code> and <code>read()</code>, and
it is also available for use with types written by end-users.</p>
<p>As an illustration, consider the following example that prints an
array in a couple of different formats:</p>
<div data-code-type="main" data-code-section="only">
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3

</div>
<p>Line 5
 uses a normal
<code>writeln()</code> to print the array of integers to the standard console
output&nbsp;(<code>stdout</code>) using Chapel’s traditional format—one element
at a time, separated by spaces.  Then, in line 7, we create a
variant of <code>stdout</code> that uses the <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.32/modules/standard/JSON.html">JSON
serializer</a>
for all <code>write()</code>s called on it.  The result is that when we write
the array to this output stream in line 8, it is printed using
standard JSON formatting.  Other current serializers support
<a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.32/modules/standard/IO.html#IO.binarySerializer">binary</a>,
<a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.32/modules/packages/YAML.html">YAML</a>,
and <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.32/modules/packages/ChplFormat.html">Chapel
syntax</a>
as alternate formats.</p>
<p>The new serialization framework also includes deserializers, which
support reading values back in from the given format.  And most
importantly, users can now define their own methods specifying how
their types should be written or read.  This can be done in a
format-neutral manner for simplicity, or in a way that’s sensitive
to the output format when needed.  For more information on defining
these methods, please refer to <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.32/modules/standard/ChapelIO.html#the-serialize-and-deserialize-methods">their online
documentation</a>.</p>
<h4 id="improved-arm64-support">Improved ARM64 Support</h4>
<p>Thanks to our colleagues on the
<a href="https://www.sandia.gov/qthreads/">Qthreads</a> team at Sandia National
Laboratories, support for ARM64 chips is significantly improved in
Chapel 1.32.  Specifically, this release bundles version 1.19 of
Qthreads, in which task creation and switching have been
re-implemented using assembly code for ARM64 chips.  This can
dramatically reduce multitasking overheads when using Chapel’s
preferred <code>CHPL_TASKS=qthreads</code> mode.</p>
<p>As a simple illustration, the following table shows the impact of
this fast task switching on a 16-node run of
<a href="https://github.com/jdevinney/bale">Bale</a> Index Gather using various
implementation strategies:</p>

<p>In addition, Qthreads 1.19 also improved portability for ARM64-based
platforms.  This enables the use of <code>CHPL_TASKS=qthreads</code> on a wider
variety of systems, such as M1/M2 Macs, where it is now the default.</p>
<h4 id="and-much-more">And much more…</h4>
<p>Beyond the highlights mentioned here, Chapel 1.32 contains numerous
other improvements to Chapel’s features and interfaces, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>initial support for array allocations that will throw if the
system is out of memory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a more robust set of types and routines for dealing with C pointer
types, particularly with respect to <code>const</code>-ness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>initial support for interface declarations, to opt-in to special
methods like the serialization methods mentioned above</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>features for power users to better understand the vectorization
and transformation of their Chapel programs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support for selecting between processor types on chips with
heterogeneous processing units</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I have been working on a hobby project to reimagine the C core of <a href="https://coredumped.dev/tags/rust/">Emacs in Rust</a>. On this journey, I reached the point where I needed some way to represent the text of a buffer. The simplest approach is to just use a large string or array of lines. However these each suffer from poor performance as either the size or line length of text increases.</p>
<p>GNU Emacs has famously used a gap buffer to represent editable text. It’s even mentioned by name on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_buffer">wikipedia</a> entry for it. Gap buffers have the advantage of allowing fast local edits with a fairly simple design. Essentially you hold the text in a giant array with a gap of unused bytes in the middle. When you insert text, you replace some of the bytes with text, making the gap smaller. When you want to insert somewhere else in the text, you move the gap to that location and do the same operation. Delete performs the opposite operation, expanding the gap. With this simple mechanism, you can efficiently represent editable text.</p>
<p>I see it as analogous to the more general data structure, the “array”. A gap buffer is just an array that is optimized for inserting at a “cursor” instead of at the end. Using a gap buffer has served Emacs well over many decades.</p>
<p>Despite this, Emacs seems largely alone in its choice in the modern world. Most popular editors today use some variation of either a <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2018/03/23/text-buffer-reimplementation">piece table</a> or a <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/fleet/2022/02/fleet-below-deck-part-ii-breaking-down-the-editor/">rope</a>. Rather than storing data as a large contiguous array, these data structures chop the buffer into small chunks and operate on those. This enables them to avoid the O(n) penalty of moving the cursor when doing edits far away and the latency of resizing the buffer.</p>
<p>Rust has <a href="https://crates.io/search?q=ropey">many rope crates</a> that have had a lot of optimization work put in. The obvious thing to do was to just pick one and move on. But I wanted to see for myself how the gap buffer holds up to these more “advanced” data structures. Modern computers can operate very quickly over linear memory. So I built a gap buffer and stacked it up against the competition.</p>
<h2 id="design">
    <a href="#design">
      Design
    </a>
</h2>
<p>My gap buffer (<a href="https://github.com/CeleritasCelery/rune/tree/master/crates/text-buffer">link</a>) is fairly true to the original design, with one big change; I store <a href="https://github.com/CeleritasCelery/rune/blob/master/crates/text-buffer/src/metric.rs">metrics</a> about the buffer in a separate tree. These metrics include things like char and line position, but could, in theory, include anything you want (like UTF-16 <a href="https://docs.rs/ropey/latest/ropey/struct.Rope.html#method.char_to_utf16_cu">code units</a>). This means that <em>finding</em> an arbitrary position in the buffer becomes at worse O(logn), but we still have to pay the cost of moving the gap.</p>
<p>The ropes that I will be comparing against are <a href="https://docs.rs/ropey/latest/ropey/index.html">Ropey</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/crop/0.3.0/crop/index.html">Crop</a>, and <a href="https://docs.rs/jumprope/latest/jumprope/index.html">Jumprope</a>. The last one is technically implemented via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list">skip lists</a>, but that’s an implementation detail and the performance should be similar.</p>
<h2 id="gap-buffer-costs">
    <a href="#gap-buffer-costs">
      Gap buffer costs
    </a>
</h2>
<p>Before we jump into <a href="https://github.com/CeleritasCelery/rope-benches">benchmarks</a> comparing ropes and gap buffers. Let’s look at the time it takes to complete the two highest latency operations on gap buffers: resizing and moving the gap. This is a cost that ropes don’t share because their worst case for an editing operation is O(logn).</p>
<h3 id="resize">
    <a href="#resize">
      Resize
    </a>
</h3>
<p>Insertion in a gap buffer is O(1), just like an appending to a vector. But also like vectors, they only achieve this in the amortized case. Vectors need to resize once they get full, and this is a O(N) operation. But since the time between resizing is N appends, it averages out to O(1). Gap buffers are similar, except that we don’t usually continue to grow the gap as the text gets larger (that would lead to more overhead). In this sense, it isn’t truly O(1) insertion time, but even if it was, we generally care about the latency in interactive applications more than we care about the average case.</p>
<figure><img src="https://coredumped.dev/images/buffer_resize.png">
</figure>

<p>Note that both axes are logarithmic. We can see that the cost to resize grows linearly with the size of the buffer, which is what we would expect. With a 1GB<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> file, it takes a little over 100ms to resize, which is starting to be perceptible.</p>
<h3 id="moving-the-gap">
    <a href="#moving-the-gap">
      Moving the gap
    </a>
</h3>
<p>How long does it take to slide the gap a given distance? This delay is added anytime we edit a different part of the buffer than we are currently in. The farther the move, the longer it takes. Unlike resizing which (from a user’s perspective) strikes randomly, this latency is easier to predict. You generally know when you are editing something farther than where you are currently at.</p>
<figure><img src="https://coredumped.dev/images/buffer_move_gap.png">
</figure>

<p>Moving the gap 1GB is significantly faster than resizing 1GB, taking only 22ms. This isn’t nothing, but is small enough to be imperceptible. Of course, since this is a O(n) relationship, moving the gap even farther will have a proportionally higher cost.</p>
<p>In practice, these latencies will be less of an issue, because giant files tend to be log files and auto-generated output, which are rarely edited. However, it is still an unavoidable cost of storing data in a contiguous fixed-sized structure.</p>
<h2 id="memory-overhead">
    <a href="#memory-overhead">
      Memory overhead
    </a>
</h2>
<p>For our comparisons, let’s start with memory overhead. The way to read this is if something has 50% overhead, that means you need 1.5GB of memory to open a 1GB file.</p>
<figure><img src="https://coredumped.dev/images/buffer_overhead.png">
</figure>

<p>Woah! Jumprope is way outside the norm here, almost doubling the memory needed to open a file<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Crop and Ropey are much closer to what you would expect. However, this is the ideal case of opening a new file. Each rope node will be perfectly filled and the tree properly balanced.</p>
<h3 id="edit-overhead">
    <a href="#edit-overhead">
      Edit overhead
    </a>
</h3>
<p>Let’s look at the overhead when edits are applied to the text. These could be things like large search and replace or multiple cursors. This tends to leave the ropes in a less ideal state, and hence have higher overhead.</p>
<figure><img src="https://coredumped.dev/images/buffer_edit_overhead.png">
</figure>

<p>Fairly significant change for all ropes. Jumprope has gone through the roof, jumping so high that I didn’t even bother expanding the plot to show it. Even crop, which had the lowest rope overhead in ideal conditions, has jumped almost 20x. The gap buffer on the other hand has barely moved. Unlike ropes, a gap buffer is always in ideal state with regards to layout. This unique property will show up later in the searching benchmarks.</p>
<h2 id="real-world">
    <a href="#real-world">
      Real world
    </a>
</h2>
<p>To compare editing performance we have a set of 5 <a href="https://github.com/josephg/editing-traces">real world</a> benchmarks from the author of Jumprope. These are recordings or “traces” of actual people editing some text in an editor. Each benchmark starts empty, then replays thousands of edits and arrives at the end text.</p>

<img src="https://coredumped.dev/images/realworld2.png" alt="">
<img src="https://coredumped.dev/images/realworld3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Aside from Ropey, all the containers have comparable performance. In all benchmarks but one, the gap buffer is the fastest, but not by any meaningful amount. This demonstrates that in the average case, insert and delete performance is fairly comparable between the different data structures. Let’s zoom in on some specialized use cases.</p>
<h2 id="creating">
    <a href="#creating">
      Creating
    </a>
</h2>
<p>So we have a sense of the memory overhead and average performance for the different containers. Here we will compare the time to load and save the text from the data structures.</p>
<h3 id="creating-from-a-string">
    <a href="#creating-from-a-string">
      Creating from a String
    </a>
</h3>
<p>How long does it take to create a new data structure from a <code>String</code>? The string below is 1GB in size.</p>
<figure><img src="https://coredumped.dev/images/from_string.png">
</figure>

<p>The gap buffer is significantly faster than the rest, but it’s not really a fair comparison. A <code>String</code> is essentially already a gap buffer. It has the string text, followed by some amount of unused capacity which can be used as a gap. So in this case we don’t need to copy or allocate at all, instead reusing the allocation from the string. That won’t always be the case, so how do things compare if we force them all to copy the source text? This would be the case when loading from a file.</p>
<figure><img src="https://coredumped.dev/images/from_str.png">
</figure>

<p>Forcing a copy makes the gap buffer take about three times as long, but it is still faster than the rope implementations.</p>
<h3 id="saving">
    <a href="#saving">
      Saving
    </a>
</h3>
<p>What about saving a file? Here we are not going to benchmark the actual file system overhead, but instead use “writing the contents of 1GB to a string” as a proxy.</p>
<figure><img src="https://coredumped.dev/images/save.png">
</figure>

<p>All containers are pretty comparable on this front.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-cursors">
    <a href="#multiple-cursors">
      Multiple cursors
    </a>
</h2>
<p>Back in 2017, Chris Wellons wrote a <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/09/07/">blog post</a> titled “Gap Buffers Are Not Optimized for Multiple Cursors”. It makes the case that since gap buffers have to move the gap buffer back to the first cursor for each edit (a O(n) operation), they don’t scale well with multiple cursors. So instead of using multiple cursors, you should use some other editing operation like macros. <a href="https://github.com/hauleth/sad.vim#why-not-multiple-cursors">This</a> idea <a href="https://cdacamar.github.io/data%20structures/algorithms/benchmarking/text%20editors/c++/editor-data-structures/">has</a> now <a href="https://github.com/emacs-ng/emacs-ng/issues/378#issuecomment-907577662">become</a> part <a href="https://vms.wwwtech.de/notes/360">of</a> Internet <a href="https://vuink.com/post/ahyycebtenz-d-dpbz/blog/2017/09/07">lore</a>.</p>
<p>I was not convinced by this argument. For one thing, there are no benchmarks, and many things that make sense intuitively don’t play out that way in the real world. Also, I realized you can avoid the overhead of moving the gap back to the first cursor with this one weird trick (computer scientists hate him!): Every time you do an edit, you reverse the direction you iterate through the cursors. If in one edit you go from the first cursor to the last, then in the next edit you go from the last cursor to the first. This saves the overhead of moving the gap back to the first cursor each time. Essentially you just sweep the gap back and forth as you make edits. Let’s benchmark this and see how well it works.</p>

<p>It looks like this trick works. Let’s zoom in on the percent overhead of the naive version.</p>
<figure><img src="https://coredumped.dev/images/smart_diff_percent.png">
</figure>

<p>Once the distance gets large enough we have about 20-30% overhead. This shows that even in the naive case, most of the time is dominated by performing the actual edits, not moving the cursor back. Also, The overhead doesn’t grow linearly with the distance between the cursors.</p>
<h3 id="compared-to-ropes">
    <a href="#compared-to-ropes">
      Compared to ropes
    </a>
</h3>
<p>How does this compare to the rope implementations? We will start with cursors 100 bytes apart and increase the total cursor count.</p>
<figure><img src="https://coredumped.dev/images/cursor_count.png">
</figure>

<p>The relationship is almost perfectly linear, with Crop and Jumprope about twice as fast as Ropey but 50% slower than the gap buffer. This relationship continues as we move beyond 10,000 cursors. So having high numbers of cursors doesn’t impact gap buffers.</p>
<p>But one thing that might cause trouble is the distance <em>between</em> the cursors. Let’s benchmark 100 cursors while varying the average distance between them:</p>
<figure><img src="https://coredumped.dev/images/cursor_distance.png">
</figure>

<p>Now the weakness of gap buffers starts to show. The distance between cursors does not matter to ropes, because every edit is O(logn), however, it matters a lot to gap buffers. You can see that the ropes are all roughly flat, but the gap buffer has a positive slope. After about 1K Jumprope and Crop start to beat it, and after about 4K it falls behind Ropey.</p>
<p>However, there is nothing special about multiple cursors with this relationship. Gap buffers struggle with long-distance edits no matter what mechanism is used. It would be the same with macros, search and replace, etc. Given that, I would claim that gap buffers are optimized for multiple cursors just fine, it is non-local edits that are the source of the issue.</p>
<h2 id="searching">
    <a href="#searching">
      Searching
    </a>
</h2>
<p>People don’t only edit text, they also analyze it. One of the most common ways to do this is via searching. Rust has a highly optimized regex crate, but it only operates on slices. This is <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/1192">problematic</a> for <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/211">ropes</a> since they store the buffer in many small allocations. Currently, the best way to do a regex search over a rope is to copy all the chunks out into a separate allocation and perform your search over that<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. There is some work to create a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/425">streaming API version</a> of regex based on <code>regex-automata</code>, but it still has not been developed and may never prove to be as fast as slice searching.</p>
<p>Given that, I wanted to test out how the different containers do when performing a full-text search. We would expect the gap buffer to have a significant advantage here because it is already in slice format.</p>
<figure><img src="https://coredumped.dev/images/search.png">
</figure>

<p>We can see that the buffer is a near-perfect line because we are essentially only benchmarking the speed of the regex engine. The ropes on the other hand have significantly higher overhead and more variability. Searching 1 GB text, the gap buffer runs in 35ms, which is around 7x faster than the next fastest rope (~250ms).</p>
<p>You might object that we are making things too easy for the gap buffer because the gap is at the start. If the gap was anywhere else we would need to move to before searching. Fair enough, but most of the time we wouldn’t need to move the gap all the way to the beginning or end. If the search is not multi-line, then you just need to move the gap to the nearest line boundary. But for the sake of analysis, let’s pretend we are doing a multi-line search. We will run the benchmark again with the gap in the middle of the text; the worst-case scenario. This will mean we need to move the gap 50% of the way across the text before we can begin searching.</p>
<figure><img src="https://coredumped.dev/images/search_move.png">
</figure>

<p>It adds about 30% overhead to the gap search. This still doesn’t put it anywhere near the ropes. Ultimately, the speed of search was one of the reasons that I chose gap buffer over ropes for my project. Emacs does a lot of searching.</p>
<p>That being said, many new parser libraries like Tree-sitter are already designed to operate on non-contiguous chunks, so the need for search becomes less important. We will see how this plays out in the future.</p>
<h2 id="what-should-you-use">
    <a href="#what-should-you-use">
      What should you use?
    </a>
</h2>
<p>So is this to say that everyone should switch over and start using gap buffers? Not quite. Ropes are really powerful data structures, and they never have the latency spikes associated with resizing or moving the gap. In real-world editing scenario’s it isn’t the best case or even the average case, it’s the worst-case tail latency that really matters. With ropes, you get worse case O(logn) behavior for all editing operations. As files get larger the extra latency associated with gap buffers starts to show itself. On the flip side, in my experience the larger a file is the less likely I am to be editing it, but the more likely I am to be searching it. These trade-offs work well in favor of gap buffers.</p>
<p>Ropes have <a href="https://github.com/emacs-ng/emacs-ng/issues/378#issuecomment-907680382">other benefits</a> besides good performance. Both Crop and Ropey support concurrent access from multiple threads. This lets you take snapshots to do <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171220080405/https://blog.atom.io/2017/10/12/atoms-new-buffer-implementation.html">asynchronous saves</a>, backups, or multi-user edits. This isn’t something you could easily do with a gap buffer.</p>
<p>Despite all that, gap buffers showed they can do quite well when placed against more “advanced” data structures. One of their key advantages is that gap buffers are always in an ideal state. They never need to worry about fragmentation or being unbalanced like trees do. The way I see it, gap buffers are better for searching and memory usage, but ropes are better at non-local editing patterns. Despite their simplicity, gap buffers can hold their own in the modern world. Maybe Emacs was on to something.</p>

<p>You may think this unnecessary, and instead you only run the regex one line at a time. If the line is completely contained within a chunk you don’t need to allocate anything. And indeed both crop and ropey provide an iterator over the lines of text. But in my testing, this was about an order of magnitude slower than just copying the whole allocation and searching. I am not sure if that mostly comes from the iteration overhead, or if small regex runs are inefficient.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

The shift sought “to raise the prices against the highest bidder,” Whinston told Judge Amit Mehta in federal court in Washington.</p><p>Google’s advertising auctions require the winner to pay only a penny more than the runner-up. In 2016, the company discovered that the runner-up had often bid only 80% of the winner’s offer. To help eliminate that 20% between the runner-up and what the winner was willing to pay, Google gave the second-place bidder a built-in handicap to make their offer more competitive, Whinston said, citing internal emails and sealed testimony by Google finance executive Jerry Dischler earlier in the case.</p><p>“It’s really easy to slip into the thought that it’s an auction and an auction is competition,” Whinston said, explaining how Google’s ability to tweak the rules demonstrates its monopoly over online advertising. But “it’s the advertisers who are running in this race. It’s Google setting the rules.”</p><p>The Justice Department alleges that Google has illegally maintained a monopoly over online search by paying billions of dollars to web browsers and smartphone manufacturers to ensure it’s the preselected option for users accessing the web. As part of those deals, Google pays Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and others a share of the revenue it earns from search advertising.</p><p>About two-thirds, more than 60%, of Google’s total revenue comes from search ads, Dischler said previously, amounting to more than $100 billion in 2020. Every year since 2012, the company’s search ad revenue growth has been in the “high teens,” according to documents shown by the Justice Department.</p><p>Dischler testified on Sept. 19 that Google sometimes tweaked its advertising auctions to ensure it met revenue targets, but most of his testimony occurred in a sealed session. Whinston’s comments Friday described Google’s technique, called “squashing,” that seeks to make the runner-up’s bid more competitive. Google estimated that technique along with charging more for ads that used more words in their text would increase revenues by 15%.</p><p>“Google has not been transparent about what they are doing” with pricing, Whinston said. But advertisers “do have ways of finding out even if they don’t know exactly what Google is doing.”</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-08/bond-market-pain-is-a-sign-of-interest-rates-returning-to-normal?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Free-Money Experiment Is Over;elm:context_link;itc:0">The Free-Money Experiment Is Over</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-03/can-ai-pick-stocks-better-than-wall-street-firms-are-trying?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Can AI Beat the Market?

<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content--installation-development" dir="auto"><a href="#-installation-development">🤓 Installation (Development)</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">There are two ways to install a development setup of LeanTime. The first (but most techical) is to install all pieces of the system locally. The second (and prefered method) is to use a docker containerized development environment.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-local-development-installation" dir="auto"><a href="#local-development-installation">Local Development Installation</a></h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Clone repository to your local server</li>
<li>Create MySQL database</li>
<li>Run wbepack builder via <code>make build-dev</code></li>
<li>Point your local domain to the <code>public/</code> directory</li>
<li>Rename <code>config/.env.sample</code> to <code>config/.env</code></li>
<li>Fill in your database credentials (username, password, host, dbname) in <code>config/.env</code></li>
<li>Navigate to <code>&lt;localdomain&gt;/install</code></li>
<li>Follow instructions to install database and user account</li>
</ul>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-development-installation-via-docker" dir="auto"><a href="#development-installation-via-docker">Development Installation via Docker</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">For development, we use a dockerized development environment. You will need to have <code>docker</code>, <code>docker compose</code>, <code>make</code>, <code>composer</code>, <code>git</code> and <code>npm</code> installed.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Notes for Windows Environments:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Run all commands within the git bash terminal in order to utilize unix specific commands</li>
<li>If installing php from a zip file, make sure to configure php.ini
It does not exist initially, so copy C:\php\php.ini-development to C:\php\php.ini. You will also need to edit php.ini in a text editor and enable all needed extentions for the build process. You can find these by running the make commands and looking for any extensions that error out as missing. You can enable them by seaching php.ini for the extension that will look like: <code>;extension=gd</code> and removing the semicolon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In order to build the development docker image, in the root of this repository, run a primer with</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>make clean build</code></p>
<p dir="auto">afterwards, run</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>make run-dev</code></p>
<p dir="auto">this will start the development server on port 8080.</p>
<p dir="auto">The dev environment provides a mysql server, mail server, s3 server, and should be good to go for your needs out of the box. The configuration of the development environment is found in <code>.dev/.env</code>, and is already seeded with the appropriate values. <strong>You should probably not be modifying this unless you plan to work on a feature for a specific integration</strong>. the applications you get are as follows</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="http://localhost:8080/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8080</a> : leantime</li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:8081/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8081</a> : maildev - to check emails sent</li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:8082/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8082</a> : phpmyadmin(authentication <code>leantime:leantime</code>) to check the DB schema and data</li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:8083/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8083</a> : s3ninja - to check s3 uploads. You need to enable this in the <code>.dev/.env</code> file by enabling s3</li>
</ul>
<div dir="auto"><p>Additionally, XDebug is enabled, but you will have to modify your
IDE key in the <code>.dev/xdebug.ini</code> file(or alternatively, on your IDE). You also need to have port 9003 temporarily open on your firewall so you can utilize it effectively. This is because connections from docker to the host will count as external inbound connection

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, October 9, 2023</em></p><p>I've been interested in <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/">local-first software</a> for a long time, and recently attended an event about it with a bunch of luminaries from various research groups. I learned a lot, and it rekindled my interest in syncable data structures.</p><p>I've tried to sync data over the years with varying degrees of success. For example, I've known about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation">operational transformations (OT)</a> for a while (via <a href="https://quilljs.com/">Quill</a>, but I have never been able to get the syncing operations working to my satisfaction. Message ordering is crucially important in OT, and it's hard to get right. I get the impression that the engineers who worked on Google Wave (which also used OT) also struggled with this…&nbsp;I remember reading a quote a while back that said something along the lines of "I wish I could have those years of my life back, and I wouldn't recommend anyone else try syncing this way." Ouch!</p><p>In contrast to OT, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) seem really promising! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">Wikipedia has a good summary</a>, which I'll quote:</p><blockquote><p>In distributed computing, a conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT) is a data structure that is replicated across multiple computers in a network, with the following features:</p><ol><li>The application can update any replica independently, concurrently and without coordinating with other replicas.</li><li>An algorithm (itself part of the data type) automatically resolves any inconsistencies that might occur.</li><li>Although replicas may have different state at any particular point in time, they are guaranteed to eventually converge.</li></ol></blockquote><p>These properties appeal to me! If CRDTs can automatically and independently converge, no matter how far apart they drift, then you could store them wherever and however you like. Offline support should be simple, and adding live collaboration features should not mean spending years figuring out edge cases. Sign me up!</p><p>What are CRDTs made from, though? It looks like typically it's some internal stuff, a function to resolve the internal stuff to a <code>value</code>, and a function to <code>merge</code> two of the data structure together. The merge function is the number-one-most-important thing about this whole arrangement, and has to satisfy<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> these three laws:</p><ul><li>commutative (so <code>merge(a, b)</code> must be the same as <code>merge(b, a)</code>)</li><li>associative (so <code>merge(merge(a, b), c)</code> must be the same as <code>merge(a, merge(b, c))</code>)</li><li>idempotent (so <code>merge(a, b)</code> must be the same as <code>merge(merge(a, b), b)</code>.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>)</li></ul><p>If all these are true, we can always merge two states, regardless of how many changes have been made since we last merged, and get the same result on both sides of the sync. Cool!</p><p>These seem like the kinds of things that <a href="https://bytes.zone/projects/learning-alloy/">Alloy</a> would be good at modeling, so let's try it! Over the next couple of posts, I'm going to build a handful of data structures that follow these three rules and compose them into data structures we could build an application on top of.</p><p>Let's get a taste for this with <code>OR(bool, bool)</code>. First off, does it satisfy our three properties?</p><ul><li>commutative: <code>OR(True, False)</code> is the same as <code>OR(False, True)</code></li><li>associative: <code>OR(OR(True, False), True)</code> is the same as <code>OR(True, OR(False, True))</code></li><li>idempotent: calling <code>OR(x, True)</code> gives the same result as <code>OR(OR(x, True), True)</code>.</li></ul><p>So it looks like <code>OR</code> might be fine, but let's be sure. We can check this in Alloy by first defining<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> a boolean:</p><pre data-lang="alloy"><code data-lang="alloy"><span>enum</span><span> Bool { True, False }
</span></code></pre><p>Then a merge function, which we check is correct:</p><pre data-lang="alloy"><code data-lang="alloy"><span>fun </span><span>merge[</span><span>a, b: Bool</span><span>]</span><span>:</span><span> Bool {
</span><span>  </span><span>// OR
</span><span>  a </span><span>=</span><span> True </span><span>implies</span><span> a </span><span>else</span><span> b
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>check</span><span> MergeIsCorrect {
</span><span>  </span><span>// read as: given `a` and `b`, which are `Bool`, the
</span><span>  </span><span>// following condition must hold.
</span><span>  </span><span>all</span><span> a, b</span><span>:</span><span> Bool </span><span>|
</span><span>    (a </span><span>=</span><span> True </span><span>or</span><span> b </span><span>=</span><span> True) </span><span>implies </span><span>merge[</span><span>a, b</span><span>] </span><span>=</span><span> True
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>And finally, our three properties:</p><pre data-lang="alloy"><code data-lang="alloy"><span>check</span><span> MergeIsCommutative {
</span><span>  </span><span>all</span><span> a, b</span><span>:</span><span> Bool </span><span>| </span><span>merge[</span><span>a, b</span><span>] </span><span>= </span><span>merge[</span><span>b, a</span><span>]
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>check</span><span> MergeIsAssociative {
</span><span>  </span><span>all</span><span> a, b, c</span><span>:</span><span> Bool </span><span>| </span><span>merge[</span><span>merge[a, b</span><span>]</span><span>, c] </span><span>= </span><span>merge[</span><span>a, merge[b, c</span><span>]</span><span>]
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>check</span><span> MergeIsIdempotent {
</span><span>  </span><span>all</span><span> a, b</span><span>:</span><span> Bool </span><span>| </span><span>merge[</span><span>a, b</span><span>] </span><span>= </span><span>merge[</span><span>merge[a, b</span><span>]</span><span>, b]
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>Great! Alloy can't find any errors with <code>OR</code>.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> We expected that, so let's break it in interesting ways. What if the merge function was <code>XOR(bool, bool)</code><sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> instead?</p><pre data-lang="alloy"><code data-lang="alloy"><span>fun </span><span>merge[</span><span>a, b: Bool</span><span>]</span><span>:</span><span> Bool {
</span><span>  a </span><span>=</span><span> b </span><span>implies</span><span> False </span><span>else</span><span> True
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>Now Alloy finds that we've broken idempotency: <code>merge[False, True]</code> is <code>True</code>, but <code>merge[merge[False, True], True]</code> is <code>False</code>. This would cause big problems if we used <code>XOR</code> as a merge function: the act of syncing could change our values! We can imagine this sequence of events:</p><ol><li>Node A sets the value to <code>True</code></li><li>Node B sets the value to <code>False</code></li><li>The nodes sync, both resolving to <code>True</code> (since <code>XOR(True, False)</code> is <code>True</code>)</li><li>The nodes sync again, both resolving to <code>False</code> (since <code>XOR(True, True)</code> is <code>False</code>)</li><li>Further syncs would stay at <code>False</code> until someone changed the value to <code>True</code>, at which point we'd repeat from step 3.</li></ol><p>But in a fun twist of fate, we don't <em>have</em> to imagine this; we can ask Alloy to generate these traces for us. First we'll make a document that contains a changeable value:</p><pre data-lang="alloy"><code data-lang="alloy"><span>sig</span><span> Document {
</span><span>  var value</span><span>: one</span><span> Bool,
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>Then we'll define a <code>not</code> for our boolean and a couple of operations (flipping an arbitrary value and syncing two documents):</p><pre data-lang="alloy"><code data-lang="alloy"><span>fun </span><span>bool_not[</span><span>b: Bool</span><span>]</span><span>:</span><span> Bool {
</span><span>  b </span><span>=</span><span> True </span><span>implies</span><span> False </span><span>else</span><span> True
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>// intent: when `flip` is true, the provided document will go
</span><span>// from True to False or False to True in the next time step. 
</span><span>// This serves as our proxy for someone clicking a button in
</span><span>// a UI or whatever.
</span><span>pred </span><span>flip[</span><span>d: Document</span><span>]</span><span> {
</span><span>  </span><span>// implementation: `value` is actually a set of tuples from
</span><span>  </span><span>// documents to booleans, and `value'` is the same but in the
</span><span>  </span><span>// next time step. We set the entire value explicitly
</span><span>  </span><span>// (instead of just saying like `d'.value = False`) because
</span><span>  </span><span>// otherwise Alloy could say "and what if something changes
</span><span>  </span><span>// that you weren't expecting?"
</span><span>  </span><span>//
</span><span>  </span><span>// Syntax: `-&gt;` creates a tuple, and `++` replaces all
</span><span>  </span><span>// existing tuples referencing `d` in the set.
</span><span>  value' </span><span>=</span><span> value </span><span>++</span><span> d</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bool_not[</span><span>d.value</span><span>]
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>// intent: merge two documents together in a way that all the
</span><span>// `merge` rules hold. Maybe imagine we have `d1` locally and
</span><span>// are getting `d2` over the network (but remember that order

</span><span>pred </span><span>sync[</span><span>d1, d2: Document</span><span>]</span><span> {
</span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> merged </span><span>= </span><span>merge[</span><span>d1.value, d2.value</span><span>]</span><span> {

</span><span>  }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>Now wire them up so these events can happen over time:<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup></p><pre data-lang="alloy"><code data-lang="alloy"><span>pred</span><span> init {
</span><span>  </span><span>// `Document` is a set of documents, and `-&gt;` will apply pairwise
</span><span>  </span><span>// for the sets in its arguments, so this means this says "all

</span><span>  value </span><span>=</span><span> Document </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> False
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>fact</span><span> traces {
</span><span>  </span><span>// this says "start with `init`, then pick one of these things to
</span><span>  </span><span>// happen at each time step." Putting it in a `fact` means that
</span><span>  </span><span>// any assertions we make from now on assume that we want these
</span><span>  </span><span>// instructions.
</span><span>  init
</span><span>  always {
</span><span>    (</span><span>one</span><span> d</span><span>:</span><span> Document </span><span>| </span><span>flip[</span><span>d</span><span>]</span><span>)
</span><span>    </span><span>or</span><span> (</span><span>some</span><span> d1, d2</span><span>:</span><span> Document </span><span>| </span><span>sync[</span><span>d1, d2</span><span>]</span><span>)
</span><span>  }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>We can now check that our sync is idempotent:<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup></p><pre data-lang="alloy"><code data-lang="alloy"><span>check</span><span> SyncIsIdempotent {
</span><span>  </span><span>// at all times, if sync happens twice in a row (the `;` syntax) then
</span><span>  </span><span>// the next value (`value'`) and the one after that (`value''`) should
</span><span>  </span><span>// be the same.
</span><span>  always </span><span>all</span><span> d1, d2</span><span>:</span><span> Document </span><span>|
</span><span>    (</span><span>sync[</span><span>d1, d2</span><span>]</span><span>; </span><span>sync[</span><span>d1, d2</span><span>]</span><span>) </span><span>implies</span><span> value' </span><span>=</span><span> value''
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>If we make <code>OR</code> our <code>merge</code> function, this works fine and Alloy can't find any counterexamples. If we use <code>XOR</code> for <code>merge</code>, though, Alloy finds the trace I mentioned could show up earlier. Here's what it shows us.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Step</th><th>Description</th><th>Image</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.</td><td>We start off with all documents at <code>False</code>.</td><td><img src="https://bytes.zone/images/xor-trace-step-1-and-4.png" alt="an Alloy instance showing two documents both set to False"></td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>One of the documents flips to <code>True</code>.</td><td><img src="https://bytes.zone/images/xor-trace-step-2.png" alt="the previous instance, but with one document now set to True"></td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>The documents sync, converging to <code>True</code>.</td><td><img src="https://bytes.zone/images/xor-trace-step-3.png" alt="the previous instance, but with both documents now set to True"></td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>The documents sync again, converging to <code>False</code> because <code>XOR(True, True)</code> (the previously synced state) is <code>False</code>.</td><td><img src="https://bytes.zone/images/xor-trace-step-1-and-4.png" alt="the previous instance, but with both documents now set to False"></td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>Stay here forever or return to 2.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In case you're encountering them for the first time, these diagrams are generated by Alloy—they're pretty fantastic for showing other people exactly what can happen in a system. (That's also why <code>Document 0</code> is <code>d1</code> and so on. The documents are defined separately, and the <code>d1</code> and <code>d2</code> labels come from our <code>check</code> so we can see what's doing what.)</p><p>Alloy can do more than this, too. If we modify our condition to have 3 distinct documents like this:</p><pre data-lang="alloy"><code data-lang="alloy"><span>check</span><span> SyncIsIdempotent {
</span><span>  always </span><span>all disj</span><span> d1, d2, d3</span><span>:</span><span> Document </span><span>|
</span><span>    (</span><span>sync[</span><span>d1, d2</span><span>]</span><span>; </span><span>sync[</span><span>d2, d3</span><span>]</span><span>) </span><span>implies</span><span> value' </span><span>=</span><span> value''
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>Then Alloy shows the situation getting even sillier. You only need one of the nodes to be <code>False</code>, at which point it's possible that the documents as a whole could never converge again and just flap back and forth randomly forever. It all depends on which documents sync with which other documents. Turns out idempotency is pretty important!</p><p>That's it for today. Next time we'll go from booleans-of-dubious-usefulness to counters!</p><hr><p>Big thanks to <a href="https://jakelazaroff.com/">Jake Lazaroff</a> for his help reviewing this post.

      <p>I stumbled upon <a href="https://youtu.be/V_ZdvrIMKEQ">this Hardware Haven video about the Zimaboard recently.</a></p>
<p>I liked it a lot.</p>
<p>I finally bought one.</p>

<p>In short, <a href="https://www.zimaboard.com/zimaboard/product">Zimaboard</a> is a small single-board computer that is relatively affordable and comes
with an interesting selection of ports, which includes an exposed PCI Express port.</p>
<p>Before we get down to the build, here’s a list of aspects that I want to see in my dream home server:</p>
<ul>
<li>low power usage (2-15W typical power usage)</li>
<li>8GB of RAM or better</li>
<li>enough performance to run my workloads, most of which are containerized</li>
<li>2x SATA or NVMe SSD slots, plus option for a third drive for the OS</li>
<li>passively cooled and completely silent</li>
<li>compact size</li>
<li>gigabit Ethernet or better</li>
</ul>
<p>You might be thinking, “<em>Wait, that’s your <strong>dream setup</strong>? No clusters of machines, Threadrippers, 10 Gigabit networking, crazy number of disks?</em>”.
Well, yes. After years of trying all sorts of setups and learning about my home server usage patterns, this is the set of requirements that finds a balance between performance, efficiency
and silence.</p>
<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>
<p>I recommend checking <a href="https://www.zimaboard.com/zimaboard/product">the product page</a> to see the exact specifications.
The configuration I bought was the 832 model: 8GB of RAM, 32GB of eMMC storage and a quad-core Intel Celeron N3450 CPU.
It’s not the most powerful setup or even a recent one with the CPU being from 2016, but it’s just powerful enough to fit
my needs.</p>
<p>This variant of the board costs 200 USD, but other configurations cost much less
than that, I just needed the extra memory to be on the safe side. If you don’t
care about the noise and size aspect of home servers, then you can get a better
deal on the used market (<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/introducing-project-tinyminimicro-home-lab-revolution/">see the TinyMiniMicro project for inspiration)</a>,
but as you know by this point, I care about those aspects a lot.</p>
<h3 id="the-package">The package</h3>
<p>What sets the Zimaboard apart from other single board computers is how polished the product feels.
Unlike a board like the Raspberry Pi, this one comes with a case and a cooling setup
already attached to it. I suspect that a similarily configured Raspberry Pi 4/5
with all the accessories added on top would result in a price that’s quite
similar to the cost of a top-of-the-line Zimaboard.</p>
<p>The heatsink looks great and is practical at the same time.
Under the most torturous loads I could only see the CPU being around 72°C and due
to it being passively cooled it made absolutely no noise. With the case being
present, I do not have to worry about placing the board on my desk and scratching
the table or shorting something out.</p>

<p>The board does not seem to have a power button, but by default it’s configured
to power on as soon as you connect the power supply, which is great if you’re
going to use this as a home server.</p>
<p>The box that the board was shipped survived and overall I’d say that the packaging
is good. The board comes with some stickers and a single SATA data+power cable.
The included power adapter comes with EU, US and UK plugs all included.</p>
<p>Shipping to Estonia was quite fast, taking just 10 days. The shipping costs were
18 USD.</p>

<h3 id="storage">Storage</h3>
<p>The included 32GB eMMC storage is fine for hosting your operating system. The
read speeds cap out at around 175 MB/s and the typical write speeds I observed
were around 50-100 MB/s. The storage is identified as <code>mmc-BJTD4R_0xc7d04e40</code> under
<code>/dev/disk/by-id/</code>, and searching online suggests that it’s a Samsung chip.</p>
<p>Because this board offers two SATA ports, I also added a SATA Y-cable to my order
(4 USD) so that I can take my existing Samsung 870 QVO 4TB SATA drives and move
my home server setup to this board.</p>

SATA Y-cable in action.

<p>Allegedly this cable can also be used to drive
two 3.5" hard drives powered by the board itself according to <a href="https://shop.zimaboard.com/products/sata-y-cable-for-zimaboard-2-5-inch-hdd-3-5-inch-hdd-raid-free-nas-unraid">the shop page
for the Y-cable</a>, but I suspect that at that point you’ll be pushing the limits of
the 12V/3A power adapter.</p>
<p>There is also a white drive activity LED
placed near the SATA power connector on the board. Perhaps not for everyone, but I
like the aesthetic and the sight of the server doing server things.</p>
<p>The performance of the SATA ports is what you would expect. When performing
read operations on both SSD-s I saw the maximum total transfer rates hover around
900-950MB/s, which is pretty close to the SATA III transfer speed limit.</p>
<p>There is no native way to mount the two SATA drives to the Zimaboard. The creators
of the board do sell a metal bracket, but it doesn’t seem to integrate that well
to the board. However, <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/224057-zimaboard-dual-hdd-stand">there exists a 3D printable design that houses two
2.5" drives, even 15mm ones</a>, and
that’s how I ended up using a 3D printer for the first time in my life.
The print was done using a <a href="https://wiki.k-space.ee/en/utilities/3D-Printer">Voron v2 Afterburner printer hosted at k-space</a>
and it came out pretty well.</p>

<p>The drives never hit above 64°C, which is absolutely okay for these SSD-s. I’m not
sure how actual spinning hard drives might fare in this environment, but I don’t
think that it’s going to be that serious because 2.5" hard drives should not
generate as much heat in the first place.</p>
<h3 id="power-consumption">Power consumption</h3>
<p>What I love about this board is the power usage. At this point my home server
is not even the most power hungry component of my setup, that honor now goes
to the ISP-provided router/modem combo box that always draws at least 12W, even
when it’s in bridge mode.</p>
<p>Here are my power usage measurements (measured with a simple power meter):</p>
<ul>
<li>idle: 2.5W</li>
<li>no drives attached, CPU stress test (<code>stress -c 4</code>): 9.0W</li>
<li>one Samsung 870 QVO 4TB SSD attached, CPU stress test: 13.2W</li>
<li>2 SSD-s attached, typical power draw in my setup (~10-40% CPU usage): ~8-9W</li>
<li>2 SSD-s attached, max load on SSD-s and CPU: ~14W</li>
</ul>
<p>The Zimaboard, ISP modem/router box, my TP-Link router/Wi-Fi AP and my CyberPower
UPS all together use at most around 34W, all combined. That’s even less than
what my Dell monitor uses at reasonably low brightness levels!</p>
<p>These tests are not scientifically accurate, but they should give you an idea on what
power consumption numbers to expect when running this setup.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>I use a simple Prometheus Node Exporter + Grafana setup to view how much resources
my various servers use. My home server has lately either been an <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/2022/01/17/asrock-x300-future-of-desktops/">ASRock Deskmini X300 based setup</a> or
an <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2022/05/10/thinkpad-as-a-home-server/">old ThinkPad T430</a>, and something that both had in common was that the CPU usage was
generally very low, mostly at or below the 10% mark. There would be bursty loads
from time to time and backup processes running that bump that up, but not significantly.</p>

<p>Memory usage of my setup was also quite low, with all my services and containers
fitting into 2GB during typical usage. With this information and some CPU performance
comparisons done, I knew that the Zimaboard will likely be able to handle my home
server tasks.</p>
<p>This board is not very powerful, but if you mainly rely on containerized workloads
and can rely on Intel QuickSync to accelerate media transcodes, then you’ll be
just fine.</p>

<p>I was actually impressed with how well the GPU-accelerated transcode
worked on this machine once you set everything up properly.
If you’re running Linux and Jellyfin,
run <code>vainfo</code> to get a list of supported codecs and make sure that you have hardware
decoding selected for those in Jellyfin settings. Also enable hardware encoding.
I checked with <code>intel_gpu_top</code> to see if work was offloaded to the GPU and saw
activity there, which means that hardware acceleration for Jellyfin worked out great!

that have to be met for all of this to work.</a></p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>
<p>The Zimaboard does ship with a Linux-based OS called CasaOS. However, I had no
intention of using it as I know what my requirements are and my infrastructure
is already decently documented and set up via Ansible, which is why I can’t say
how good that experience is. I also did not test Windows 10 or 11.</p>
<p>During testing, I noticed that the USB 3 ports can act a bit weird. The Fedora
Server USB stick would not boot properly if connected to one of the USB ports,
and when doing other tests with external USB storage I noticed hiccups from time to time.
Not sure what might be the cause, but I’m writing it down nevertheless. It’s not
a dealbreaker for me luckily since I don’t rely much on the USB ports in typical use anyway.</p>
<p>I did not test the PCI Express port, simply because I don’t need it, yet. It’s
a great addition, though, and opens up plenty of modding capabilities in the
future.</p>
<h3 id="fedora-server-and-btrfs">Fedora Server and btrfs</h3>
<p>The Zimaboard gave me an opportunity to start fresh with my home server.</p>
<p>I made a leap: I’ve ditched ZFS and am now running
Fedora Server with my storage being on a btrfs RAID1 setup, snapshotted
and backed up using <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2022/07/09/btrbk-is-awesome/">btrbk</a>.
It was a bit tricky to migrate and set everything
up regarding backups and snapshotting, but I got it working.</p>
<p>ZFS is great, but it has always felt like an unwanted guest in the Linux ecosystem.
The kernel developers don’t care much for maintaining compatibility with ZFS since
it’s not in the kernel due to licensing issues, and Ubuntu has been one of the few
distros that actually ships a kernel that includes ZFS built in. I didn’t want
to be tied to Ubuntu forever, especially because of how they try to make <code>snap</code>
a thing. ZFS DKMS builds are generally okay on distros like Debian, but on
others you might find yourself not being able to access your data after a reboot
because of a kernel update.</p>
<p>btrfs has had some issues in the past, especially with the RAID5/6 setup, but
in my single and dual disk setups it has been solid for years, except for that one time around
2018-2019 when I ran btrfs RAID1 over USB storage. To be fair to btrfs, that
was a pretty stupid setup.</p>
<p>Before committing
to btrfs, I used two USB sticks to create a RAID1 setup and created real torture test scenarios.
Tests looked something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>write a file to the filesystem</li>
<li>use <code>md5sum</code> to calculate a hash of it for verification purposes</li>
<li>completely wipe one USB drive with <code>dd</code></li>
<li>run <code>md5sum</code> to calculate the hash again (it matched every time)</li>
<li>run <code>btrfs scrub</code> on the filesystem to fix all errors</li>
<li>rinse and repeat with variations to this setup</li>
</ul>
<p>After doing all that, I was quite confident that this was going to work.</p>
<p>One thing to note with <code>btrfs</code>: if you’re running any type of multi-disk and
redundant setup like RAID1 or RAID10, then make sure to include the mount option
<code>degraded</code> in <code>/etc/fstab</code> so that you can still mount your filesystem if one or
more of your drives fail. If you lose too many drives then it’s still probably going to fail to boot.</p>
<p>Here’s my <code>/etc/fstab</code> setup to serve as an example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>LABEL=turbo /turbo      btrfs subvol=turbo,compress-force=zstd:1,ssd,degraded,nofail            0 0
</code></pre><p>When doing the migration I kept all the paths the same, and each ZFS dataset
was recreated using <code>btrfs</code> subvolumes, which is why this filesystem is mounted on a top-level folder.</p>
<h3 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h3>
<p>My notes for the next dream home server setup included a few candidates:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Zimaboard</li>
<li><a href="https://www.asustor.com/en/product?p_id=79">Asustor Flashstor 6</a> or <a href="https://www.asustor.com/en/product?p_id=80">Flashstor 12</a></li>
<li>a TinyMiniMicro style machine with at least two NVMe SSD slots</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two fall nicely into my requirements for the dream home server. I picked
the Zimaboard mainly because it’s much cheaper and I was already running two SATA SSD-s
for my home server storage, so migrating would be really easy and I would not
have to buy any new drives.</p>
<p>If large capacity SATA SSD-s start becoming less common and NVMe SSD-s become
even cheaper than they already are, then I’ll have to look into something like a Flashstor.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overall, I’m very happy with this purchase. The performance is just enough for
my services to work reasonably fast, the board uses very little power and it’s
silent, and it looks good on my wall.</p>

<p>My setup is also quite flexible, so in case I need more resources, I can get
more Zimaboards and make them serve different purposes. However, it’s more likely
that I’m going to discover a new toy to experiment and play with by the time
I run out of resources on this one.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div x-data="prose"> <!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?--><p>Ever since we first looked up at the night sky and saw the glittering tapestry of distant stars, humanity has wondered about what else might be out there. As we learned more about the Universe, our curiosity only increased. We discovered not just the thousands of stars visible to the naked eye, but hundreds of billions within our own Milky Way, and a collection of <a href="https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/galaxies-in-universe/">an estimated trillions of galaxies</a> within our observable Universe. We now know that most of these stars likely contain a system of planets orbiting them, and many of those planets contain properties — like temperature, size, mass, and their atomic compositions — that are very similar to Earth.</p><p>Unfortunately, our hopes of visiting and exploring these worlds face a tremendous obstacle: the limitations of the speed of light. While it’s theoretically possible to accelerate objects, even macroscopic ones, close to the speed of light, the laws of physics not only prevent us from achieving or surpassing that speed, but they damn us to the severe experience of time dilation. Even if we were to get in a spaceship and travel at near-light speeds, everyone back at home would age spectacularly while we undertook our interstellar journey.</p><p>There was only one potential way out: warp drive, or taking a “short-cut” by severely curving the fabric of spacetime. Long thought impractical, the physics behind this possibility was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive">worked out by Miguel Alcubierre</a> in 1994, and the only requirement was something that anti-gravitated: something like “negative energy” or “negative mass.” With the recent measurement that <a href="https://bigthink.com/hard-science/antimatter-does-not-fall-up/">antimatter falls down in a gravitational field</a>, humanity’s greatest hope for practically achieving our warp drive dreams just suffered a massive blow. Here’s the science behind the amazing, but sobering, result.</p><!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?--><figure><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?w=800" alt="finite or infinite" width="840" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg 800w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?resize=20,20 20w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?resize=40,40 40w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?resize=80,80 80w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?resize=160,160 160w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?resize=256,256 256w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?resize=335,335 335w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?resize=512,512 512w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?resize=640,640 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?resize=375,375 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w" data-lazy-srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg 800w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?resize=20,20 20w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?resize=40,40 40w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?resize=80,80 80w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?resize=160,160 160w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?resize=256,256 256w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?resize=335,335 335w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?resize=512,512 512w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?resize=640,640 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?resize=375,375 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w" data-lazy-src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-torus.jpg?w=800&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><div><div><p>A visualization of a 3-torus model of space, where our observable Universe could be just a small portion of the overall structure.

For most of the history of mathematics, space could contain up to three dimensions, and each dimension could be correctly represented by a set of Cartesian “grid lines,” where lines that were parallel would always continue forever and never intersect.</p><p>This began to change as mathematicians began to consider two novel possibility at around the same time:</p><ol><li>that there could be “extra” spatial dimensions beyond the three we recognize,</li><li>and that space could be curved as well, rather than spatially flat.</li></ol><p>These realizations brought with them a number of immediately profound implications. Triangles, if you summed up the three angles inside of them, could add up to fewer or greater values than 180 degrees, dependent on whether your space was negatively or positively curved. Parallel lines wouldn’t remain equidistant forever, but would either diverge or converge dependent on whether your space was positively or negatively curved.</p><!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?--><figure><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="839" height="755" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/https___blogs-images.forbes.com_startswithabang_files_2016_07_Untitled.png?w=839" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/https___blogs-images.forbes.com_startswithabang_files_2016_07_Untitled.png 839w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/https___blogs-images.forbes.com_startswithabang_files_2016_07_Untitled.png?resize=375,337 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/https___blogs-images.forbes.com_startswithabang_files_2016_07_Untitled.png?resize=640,576 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/https___blogs-images.forbes.com_startswithabang_files_2016_07_Untitled.png?resize=768,691 768w" data-lazy-srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/https___blogs-images.forbes.com_startswithabang_files_2016_07_Untitled.png 839w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/https___blogs-images.forbes.com_startswithabang_files_2016_07_Untitled.png?resize=375,337 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/https___blogs-images.forbes.com_startswithabang_files_2016_07_Untitled.png?resize=640,576 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/https___blogs-images.forbes.com_startswithabang_files_2016_07_Untitled.png?resize=768,691 768w" data-lazy-src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/https___blogs-images.forbes.com_startswithabang_files_2016_07_Untitled.png?w=839&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><div><div><p>The angles of a triangle add up to different amounts depending on the spatial curvature present.

These wormholes would be unstable, in the sense that they could not be maintained as permanently open and traversable entities. They would instantly pinch-off and collapse, for one, and if you attempted to pass any matter through them, the gravitational tidal forces from the severe curvature of space would absolutely destroy it. Nevertheless, the wormhole, or the notion of using the curvature of space to take “short-cuts” through space, found a home in the imagination of many, including among popular fiction and science-fiction writers.</p><p>If any sort of mechanism could exist for circumventing the limitations of conventional travel through spacetime — limitations set by the speed of light — it must involve leveraging the curvature of spacetime to create such a “short-cut” between two otherwise disconnected points. Perhaps the most famous instance in all of fiction to leverage this was the idea of “warp drive” as developed by the <em>Star Trek</em> franchise. By expending a vast amount of energy, the idea was that space could be severely curved, and in some sense, compressed. As the space ship moved through the compressed space, it would take this long-sought-after short-cut, enabling very rapid travel over great distances, without causing the outside Universe to age rapidly relative to the crew.</p><!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?--><figure><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png?w=606" alt="warp bubble" width="840" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png 606w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png?resize=20,20 20w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png?resize=40,40 40w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png?resize=80,80 80w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png?resize=160,160 160w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png?resize=256,256 256w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png?resize=335,335 335w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png?resize=512,512 512w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png?resize=375,375 375w" data-lazy-srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png 606w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png?resize=20,20 20w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png?resize=40,40 40w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png?resize=80,80 80w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png?resize=160,160 160w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png?resize=256,256 256w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png?resize=335,335 335w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png?resize=512,512 512w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png?resize=375,375 375w" data-lazy-src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Star_Trek_Warp_Field.png?w=606&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><div><div><p>The way to make a realistic warp drive involves manipulating the energy field and the spacetime curvature of the region around a spacecraft.

These two types of mass/energy, both positive and negative, could be configured so that:</p><ul><li>the space “in front of” the spacecraft was bent so that it would be compressed,</li><li>while the space “behind” the spacecraft would be oppositely bent so that it would expand in compensation,</li><li>while the space in between them would be flat and bubble-like, enabling the ship within to not be destroyed.</li></ul><p>If there were some type of negative energy in the Universe that could be harnessed and manipulated, then this type of warp-drive spacetime, now known as the Alcubierre metric, could be created in real life. The only problem, of course, is that all of the particles and fields known to exist, even in theory, only have one type of mass/energy: the positive type, and hence they all curve spacetime the same way. If warp drive is to be physically realized, some sort of “exotic matter” with negative mass/energy is required.</p><!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?--><figure><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1004" height="465" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Alcubierre.png?w=1004" alt="warp bubble" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Alcubierre.png 1004w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Alcubierre.png?resize=375,174 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Alcubierre.png?resize=640,296 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Alcubierre.png?resize=768,356 768w" data-lazy-srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Alcubierre.png 1004w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Alcubierre.png?resize=375,174 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Alcubierre.png?resize=640,296 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Alcubierre.png?resize=768,356 768w" data-lazy-src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Alcubierre.png?w=1004&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><div><div><p>This two-dimensional illustration shows spacetime distortion due to an Alcubierre drive.

In fact, some argued, this assumes that Einstein’s equivalence principle is exactly correct, and that the type of mass that creates particles (i.e., the “m” in <em>E = mc²</em>) is the same as the type of mass/energy that causes spacetime to curve.</p><p>This had been tested for all different types of matter many times over, but throughout the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, had never been tested for the other type of massive quanta we can create: antiparticles.</p><p>If the laws of physics worked as expected, then matter and antimatter would behave in the same way: both curving space in proportion to their inherent energy, both gravitating the same way, and both “falling down” in the gravitational field of Earth. But this would prove difficult to test. Antimatter, remember, annihilates away with matter extremely easily: upon contact. The easiest antimatter particles to make, antiprotons and positrons, are electrically charged, and so are very difficult to “hold” in isolation. It was only at the one place in the world focused on creating and controlling antimatter — the <a href="https://home.cern/science/physics/antimatter">antimatter factory at CERN</a>, the same place that’s home to the Large Hadron Collider — that this could conceivably be tested.</p><!--?xml encoding="utf-8" ?--><figure><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2132" height="1692" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/41586_2023_6527_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="Alpha-g experiment" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/41586_2023_6527_Fig1_HTML.jpg 2132w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/41586_2023_6527_Fig1_HTML.jpg?resize=1536,1219 1536w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/41586_2023_6527_Fig1_HTML.jpg?resize=2048,1625 2048w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/41586_2023_6527_Fig1_HTML.jpg?resize=375,298 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/41586_2023_6527_Fig1_HTML.jpg?resize=640,508 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/41586_2023_6527_Fig1_HTML.jpg?resize=768,610 768w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/41586_2023_6527_Fig1_HTML.jpg?resize=1024,813 1024w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/41586_2023_6527_Fig1_HTML.jpg?resize=1280,1016 1280w" data-lazy-srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/41586_2023_6527_Fig1_HTML.jpg 2132w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/41586_2023_6527_Fig1_HTML.jpg?resize=1536,1219 1536w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/41586_2023_6527_Fig1_HTML.jpg?resize=2048,1625 2048w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/41586_2023_6527_Fig1_HTML.jpg?resize=375,298 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/41586_2023_6527_Fig1_HTML.jpg?resize=640,508 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/41586_2023_6527_Fig1_HTML.jpg?resize=768,610 768w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/41586_2023_6527_Fig1_HTML.jpg?resize=1024,813 1024w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/41586_2023_6527_Fig1_HTML.jpg?resize=1280,1016 1280w" data-lazy-src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/41586_2023_6527_Fig1_HTML.jpg?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><div><div><p>The ALPHA collaboration studies atoms of antihydrogen, testing its properties to see if it’s identical to or different from normal matter.

If antimatter truly anti-gravitated, then simply by building a spacecraft’s floor out of normal matter and its ceiling out of antimatter, we could create a spacecraft that had its own built-in, automatic system for artificial gravity. But because antimatter doesn’t anti-gravitate but only gravitates normally, the only options for artificial gravity involve either constant linear acceleration or by having a rotating cylinder about its axis: as seen in 2001: A Space Odyssey or as envisioned by the science-fiction scenario of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_cylinder">O’Neill cylinder</a>.</p><p>Although there are physicists who wonder “Why did we even need to do this experiment; we all knew that antimatter has positive mass,” that sentiment is absolutely foolish. We must remember — and I say this as a theoretical physicist myself — that physics is 100% an experimental science. We can be confident in our theory’s predictions only insofar as we can test and measure what it predicts; as soon as we step outside of the realm of what’s been validated by experiment, we run the risk of stepping outside the realm of where our theory is valid. We just learned that Einstein’s general relativity passed another test, the antimatter test, and with it, our greatest science-fiction hope for achieving warp drive has completely evaporated.</p><p><em>Author’s note: Ethan Siegel <a href="https://amzn.to/3tpzd7u">wrote the book on Star Trek’s technologies</a>, and this scenario for a potentially realistic warp drive, outlined in the book, is now ruled out.</em></p> </div></div>]]></description>

A few of my previous blog posts have been about quirks in the UK postal address system. As a result of these posts being moderately popular, people have contacted me to tell me about other such quirks. This pleases me greatly – I like quirks.</p>
<p>Mmmmm quirks.</p>
<p>Also, since finding the HM Land Registry property sales data, I’ve discovered some other vaguely interesting stuff, so I thought that I’d collate all this information into one big blog post of address-based quirky goodness.</p>
<p><span id="more-763"></span>I promise this will be the last address-related thing for a while. If I discover more quirks, I’ll just edit them into this post.<br>
<em><br>
PS. If you’ve not read my previous posts, The HM Land Registry property sales data is a list of most residential property sales in England and Wales since 1995. It’s not a comprehensive list of every house in the UK, so the findings below are not comprehensive.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>House Numbers</h2>
<h3>Highest House Number</h3>
<p>In the HM Land Registry property sales data, the highest house number is 9156, which belongs to a house near Beccles in Suffolk. However there are no other houses on the same road, nor in fact anywhere nearby, which are numbered above 2000. I assume that, in the same way that you can give your house a name, you must also be able to give it a number as a name. There can’t be any other reason why a house on a street with fewer than 10 other houses would be number 9156. Or why a house in Owls Green, a village of about 20 houses near Ipswich, would be numbered 2820 (cute).</p>
<p>If we only include streets where the house numbers increment more or less continuously upwards, according to the HM Land Registry there are five streets in England and Wales with legitimate house numbers above 2000 (with the number of the highest house in brackets):</p>
<ul>
<li>Bristol Road South, B45 9JL (2022)</li>
<li>Hessle Road, HU13 9NN (2063)</li>
<li>Warwick Road, B93 0EF (2111)</li>
<li>Coventry Road, B26 3PX (2599)</li>
<li>Stratford Road, B94 5NH (2679)</li>
</ul>
<p>Four of these streets have Birmingham postcodes.</p>
<p>Anyway, it means that the <strong>highest numbered house</strong> is: <strong>2679 Stratford Road, B94 5NH</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Lowest House Number</h3>
<p>Yes, you heard me.</p>
<p>You might assume that the lowest house number would be 1, but there are quite a few houses numbered zero. Here are some (but probably not all) of them:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>There are even some houses which go into negative numbers:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>There’s a good chance, however, that the lowest house number is this:</p>

<h3>Non-integer House Numbers</h3>
<p>The usual thing to do if you’re putting a new house in between two existing houses with consecutive numbers, is to add a letter: 10a, 17b, etc. But there are a surprising number of houses with fractions in their house numbers.</p>

<h3>Other Fractions</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://paulplowman.com/stuff/wp-content/3.25.png" alt="Map showing house number 3.25"></p>
<p>The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/vHb3kTnu8aF2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">two buildings</a> marked with red arrows are shops, and according to their websites (<a href="http://emily-robbins.co.uk/contact/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://inspiredtraveluk.com/index.php/contact/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>), they are both <em>3 Windsor Street</em>, but it seems that officially one is 3½ and the other is 3¼.</p>
<p>Likewise, the house marked with the purple arrow has the name <em>Windsor Cottage</em> on its name plate, but again it seems that officially it is 1¼.</p>
<p>There’s also <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@51.5431375,-0.1896905,3a,36.7y,185.43h,79t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sFPHDAqYf0sqBG8S3QZNsgg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656" rel="noopener" target="_blank">1¼ Woodchurch Road, Camden, London</a>.</p>
<p>And on the <em>High Street, Earl Shilton, Leicestershire</em>, there are five consecutive houses which are numbered: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@52.5767032,-1.3109799,3a,90y,153.01h,86.56t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sZi8B-_ntRpNim_iZ87Iu1w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656" rel="noopener" target="_blank">75, 75a, 75b, 75½, 75¾</a></p>

<h3>Weird Numbering Schemes</h3>
<p><a href="https://paulplowman.com/stuff/house-address-twins-proximity/#comment-7503"><em>Tony</em></a> pointed out that Nesta have a map on <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/contact-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their contact page</a> showing that they’re number 58 in a run of numbers, on London’s <em>Victoria Embankment</em>, which goes: 40, 58, 50, 56, 60.</p>
<p><a href="https://paulplowman.com/stuff/house-address-twins-proximity/#comment-7644"><em>Bryn</em></a> notes that the <em>High Street</em> in Kingswinford is numbered by the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/mWpHynr4raCMqH1i8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">distance from one end of the road</a> in metres. They have still kept odd and even numbers on opposite sides of the road.</p>
<hr>
<p>The widely stated ‘fact’ that all you need to provide is a house number and postcode for your post to reach the right address is not always true. There are many instances of different buildings having the same number and postcode. For example…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1-4 Jubilee Cottages, Warwick Road, B94 6AZ</strong> and <strong>1-4 Cedar Cottages, Warwick Road, B94 6AZ</strong></li>
<li><strong>1-3 Weymouth Street, BA1 6AG</strong> and <strong>1-3 Riverside Mews, Weymouth Street, BA1 6AG</strong>, and <strong>1-3 Weymouth Court, Weymouth Street, BA1 6AG</strong></li>
<li><strong>1 The Chase, HA5 5QP</strong> and <strong>1 Rose Cottages, The Chase, HA5 5QP</strong> and <strong>1 Park Cottages, The Chase, HA5 5QP</strong> and <strong>1 Leamington Cottages, The Chase, HA5 5QP</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://paulplowman.com/stuff/wp-content/rmaddress.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://paulplowman.com/stuff/wp-content/rmaddress.png" alt="Royal Mail Address Finder for postcode CV12 8UE"></a>The postcode <strong>CV12 8UE</strong> seems to cover <strong>Gatehouse Lane</strong>, <strong>Emes Walk</strong>, <strong>Bucklers Yard</strong>, <strong>Homers Yard</strong>, <strong>Lye Corner</strong>, <strong>Sleets Yard</strong>, and <strong>Old Penns Yard</strong> – which all share house numbers in various combinations. This must be super confusing – I can’t work out where most of these are on a map!</p>
<p>They all appear in the Royal Mail’s <a href="https://www.royalmail.com/find-a-postcode" rel="noopener" target="_blank">address finder</a>.</p>
<p>The postcode <strong>HD7 5UZ</strong> in Huddersfield also covers about seven different roads.</p>

<h2>Street Names</h2>
<h3>Dual Named Streets</h3>
<p><a href="https://paulplowman.com/stuff/house-address-twins-proximity/#comment-7402"><em>David</em></a> pointed out that in Edinburgh there are streets such as <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@55.9600277,-3.1825831,160m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Haddington Place/Elm Row</a>, which have different names in opposite directions.</p>
<p>Those streets have a tiny barrier down the middle, making them dual carriageways, but <a href="https://paulplowman.com/stuff/house-address-twins-proximity/#comment-7499" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Shay</em></a> went one better with two streets in Gateshead where each side of a single-carriageway road has a different name. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Jf8h2buV4Z42" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cambridge Terrace / Oxford Terrace</a> and <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ZpstbLZzmDm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ashgrove Terrace / Richmond Terrace</a>. The second of these has separate sets of numbers on each side of the street, so <em>1 Richmond Terrace</em> faces <em>1 Ashgrove Terrace</em>, on the same road. Some of the mapping sites struggle with this, just showing one of the names.</p>
<p><a href="https://paulplowman.com/stuff/uk-address-oddities/#comment-130874"><em>Scotty</em></a> points out a similar thing with <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/yooeh9Ydk9Rh2ayt7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Queen Street / Grosvenor Terrace</a> in Carlin How, North Yorkshire – except in this case both sides of the street have matching sets of only even numbers. Google Maps has transferred the name <em>Grosvenor Terrace</em> to the back-alley running behind the houses.</p>
<p>A similar thing also exists with <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/QCAgFiQo1wD2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">St Marks Road / Vine Place</a> in Ealing, West London. St Marks Road seems to have been given dominance on the road sign, but Google Maps calls them Vine Place. Again, each side of the road has its own set of numbers.</p>
<p>There’s also <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/vkcLqD6VVgW3YXXv7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Croft Parade / Croft Avenue</a> in Cheltenham, each with its own set of numbers. About halfway down the street both sides become Croft Gardens.</p>
<p><a href="https://paulplowman.com/stuff/house-address-twins-proximity/#comment-7489" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Anthony</em></a> notes that the houses on the west side of <em>Lainey’s Close</em>, Marlborough SN8 1BS, actually have the address <em>Chiminage Close</em>, which is a road running to the north. On one map I found, and in fact <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/DoSrsFhnTHn" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in real life as well</a>, it looks as if <em>Chiminage Close</em> extends round and becomes the pavement of <em>Lainey’s Close</em>!<br>

<p><a href="https://paulplowman.com/stuff/house-address-twins-proximity/#comment-7514" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Ralf</em></a> points out a strange phenomenon in Stevenage where entire estates, including the main road and all the spur roads, share the same name. So there’s <a href="https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=524747&amp;Y=225922&amp;A=Y&amp;Z=106" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wisden Road</a>, <a href="https://streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=525130&amp;Y=226032&amp;A=Y&amp;Z=106" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jessop Road</a>, <a href="https://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?x=525032&amp;y=225031&amp;z=106&amp;sv=525032,225031&amp;st=4&amp;ar=y&amp;mapp=map.srf&amp;searchp=ids.srf&amp;dn=669&amp;ax=525032&amp;ay=225031&amp;lm=0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Archer Road</a>, <a href="https://streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=525136&amp;Y=226837&amp;A=Y&amp;Z=106" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ripon Road</a>, and <a href="https://streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?x=525109&amp;y=226469&amp;z=106" rel="noopener" target="_blank">others</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Unimaginative Names</h3>
<p>There are over 600 streets called <em>The Street</em>, and over 400 called <em>New Street</em>. There are almost 1000 roads called <em>New Road</em>, but oddly not a single road just called <em>The Road</em>.</p>
<p>In Cumbria there is a road simply called <a href="https://streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?x=357850&amp;y=523065&amp;z=106&amp;sv=357850,523065&amp;st=4&amp;ar=y&amp;mapp=map.srf&amp;searchp=ids.srf&amp;dn=670&amp;ax=357850&amp;ay=523065&amp;lm=0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Street</em></a>.</p>
<p>In Somerset there’s a road called <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7P2p8wGRUM12" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Street Road</em></a>! It goes to a town called <a href="https://streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?x=348929&amp;y=136316&amp;z=126" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Street</em></a>.</p>
<p>There are almost 2500 streets called <em>High Street</em>, and many more which are <em>&lt;name of town&gt; High Street</em>, but there are only 59 streets named <em>Low Street</em>!</p>
<p>Lots of industrial estates don’t bother naming streets at all and just give them numbers instead. Sometimes this happens with housing estates as well, like <a href="https://streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?x=524323&amp;y=409904&amp;z=106" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this one</a> in Grimsby, and <a href="https://streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?x=507368&amp;y=433062&amp;z=110&amp;sv=507368,433062&amp;st=4&amp;ar=y&amp;mapp=map.srf&amp;searchp=ids.srf&amp;dn=619&amp;ax=507368&amp;ay=433062&amp;lm=0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this one</a> in Hull.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.alliescomputing.com/support/how-to-build-a-uk-address-form" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apparently</a>, the shortest address in Royal Mail’s address database is:</p>
<p><strong>Elba, Duns, TD11 3RY</strong></p>
<p>The longest address in their database is on the Isle Of Man, so not actually in the UK. It’s a government department where two thirds of the address is just the name of the department and the building it’s in.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Celebrity Names</h3>
<p>There are at least three celebrities who have been named after UK streets:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@53.6880372,-1.9494731,21z" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nathan Lane</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@53.7767561,-0.2554972,20.25z" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chevy Chase</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@51.2007679,-3.4804189,20.5z" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cher</a></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Single Word Roadnames</h3>
<p>And finally, inspired by <a href="https://paulplowman.com/stuff/town-and-street-name-nerdery/#comment-7407" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Paul’s comment</em></a>, I took a list of single-word streetnames, and cross-referenced it with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_Scrabble_Words" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SOWPODS</a> Scrabble dictionary to find a list of street names which are real words. Here are just a few of the most random ones…</p>

Sometime later, I also learned that "three" is usually the magic number for correctly plugging in a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/tag/usb/" data-auto-tag-linker="true">USB</a> Type-A device. It's a maddening dance and it begs the question, why wasn't the Universal Serial Bus designed with a reversible connector from the outset?</p><p>It is the most frustrating downside to one of the greatest inventions of all time. Sure, the apparent oversight was rectified with the more recent introduction of USB Type-C, but it doesn't matter for the millions of existing USB Type-A devices and ports that are in widespread use today.</p><p>Ajay Bhatt, widely considered the inventor of USB (he led the team at Intel that created the protocol), admitted to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/21/734451600/ever-plugged-a-usb-in-wrong-of-course-you-have-heres-why" data-url="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/21/734451600/ever-plugged-a-usb-in-wrong-of-course-you-have-heres-why">NPR</a> that "the biggest annoyance is reversibility." However, he defends the design decision.</p><p>Making USB reversible to begin with would have necessitated twice as many wires and twice as many circuits, and would have doubled the cost. Bhatt says his team was aware at the time of the frustration that a rectangular design could have, versus a round connector. But in an effort to keep it as cheap as possible, the decision was made to go with a design that, in theory, would give users a 50/50 chance of plugging it in correctly (you can up the odds by looking at the inside first, or identifying the logo).</p><p>"In hindsight, based on all the experiences that we all had, of course it was not as easy as it should be," Bhatt added.</p><p>So the short answer is cost, though there is a bit more to it. While we take for granted that USB is everywhere these days, convincing major PC makers to adopt the spec was not a given, or even an easy task.</p><p>"It took us some time to prove that this technology is indispensable," Bhatt said.</p><p>Incidentally, the late Steve Jobs deserves a tip-of-the-hat for helping USB become a long-lasting standard. It was in 1998 that USB made some real headway, courtesy of the iMac G3, the first computer to ship with only USB ports for external devices (there were no serial or parallel ports). That came three years after USB 1.0 debuted, with a data rate of 12Mbps.</p><p>USB flash drives arrived in 2000, the same year that USB 2.0 arrived with data transfer rates of 480Mbps. Now around two decades later, we're on the cusp of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/usb-standards-body-says-faster-usb4-devices-are-headed-to-pcs-in-2020/">USB4</a>, which will only operate over the Type-C connector.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
            <div>
      
      <p>
	October 8th 2023
      </p>
      <p>
	Ardour 8.0 is available now for Linux, Windows, and macOS, including the latest release of macOS, Sonoma.  Along with the usual set of
	important and not-so-important bug fixes, Ardour 8.0 brings users
	substantial quality of life benefits:
	</p><ul>
	  <li>"Quick groups" - most mix-related controls now operate on all the selected tracks &amp; busses</li>
	  <li>Manage sections of a song with arrangement
	  markers. Define your verses, chorus, and bridge. Then
	  rearrange or copy them as you wish.</li>
	  <li>Create persistent region groups in the editor window, to
	  make multi-region editing easier.</li>
	  <li>Edit velocity easily on a dedicated automation lane whether it's a single note or a chord.</li>
	  <li>Draw automation freely for any controller or press
	    Control (Command) key to enable line-drawing mode. You can
	    also combine free and line segments as you draw just by
	    pressing and releasing the Ctrl/Cmd key.</li>
	  <li>Fit the tempo map to a human performance, with a new dedicated tool.</li>
	  <li>If (e.g. drum) note names are available for a plugin instrument or
	    external device (via a MIDNAM file), see those names in the all-new MIDI track header.</li>
	  <li>Use Novation Launchpad Pro in DAW/Session mode (along with the standalone Sequencer, Note and Chord modes).</li>
	  <li>Create new interesting progressions with arpeggiator plugins.</li>
	</ul>
      <p>
	Note that there are no changes to Ardour's session file format
	with this release, so sessions created with previous versions, particularly those
	from the 7.x release series, should load with no new issues. If
	you opt to have Ardour copy over your configuration from 7.x,
	we will copy more files too, because of the lack of
	compatibility issues.
      </p>
      <p>
	Some people will no doubt laugh at a few
	of these "new features", given that they've been in some other
	DAWs for 20 years or more. That's OK — we laugh too when we see
	other DAWs finally adding things that Ardour could do in
	2005. 😃

	Ardour has offered several different workflows for adjusting MIDI note
	velocities, some of them much more convenient in many situations than
	the traditional "lollipops" (vertical bars with a dot on top used to
	alter the note velocity). However, there are some specific situations,
	particularly crescendos and diminuendos, where the ability to just
	draw a line to get rising or falling velocity is much better than
	working note by note.
	
	So, for Ardour 8.0 we have, after many user requests over a long time
	period, added the traditional velocity lollipop editing interface.

      <h2>Arrangement</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      Need the ability to "arrange" a composition by easily moving
      and/or copying sections ? Ardour 8 brings a dedicated ruler to
      define those sections, and a sidebar which allows you to copy or
      reorder them as you wish. Long time audio editors will note
      this means that Ardour now supports 3-point edits: a given range
      (start, end) can be moved or copied to a destination point in
      time.

      <h2>New MIDI Track Piano Roll Header</h2>
    </p>
    <div>
      <p>
	Thanks to the vision of user/contributor Alexander
	Mitchell, Ardour 8 comes with a completely redesigned MIDI track
	header piano roll and scroomer. Changes include:
	</p><ul>
	  <li>All notes reach the right edge of the piano roll</li>
	  <li>Octave numbers (C3, C4 etc) are shown at all times</li>
	  <li>Note names can be displayed in the scroomer. If MIDNAM
	    data is available to provide meaningful names they will be
	    used. If not, generic MIDI note numbers and 12TET names will
	    be shown. Note names will only be shown in draw/internal edit
	    mode, and can be controlled by user preference allowing
	    "always", "never" and "when available" (the latter referring
	    to MIDNAM note name data being available). </li>
	  <li>It is now possible to record MIDI using the piano
	    roll.</li>
	  <li>Possibly more obvious user-interaction design for the
	  scroomer ("scroll" + "zoom").</li>
	</ul>
  <p>
	MIDNAM is an industry standard to provide "names" for various
	things related to MIDI. Unlike some other DAWs, we have chosen
	to use this standard for note naming rather than devising our
	own format for this information.

      <h2>Launchpad Pro support</h2>
    </p>
    <div>
	  <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/lppro.webp" alt="a photograph of a Novation Launchpad Pro Mk3">
	  </p>
	  <div>
	    <p>
	      The Novation Launchpad Pro is an affordable, powerful pad/grid
	      device for controlling Ardour (it also works with at least one
	      other DAW). Ardour 8 features full support for just about every
	      feature of the LP Pro's "Session" mode, like Ableton Live. You
	      can use it to trigger clips and cues, but also control gain
	      levels, panning and send levels for tracks &amp; busses. The
	      fader design is quite something to see (be sure to read the LP
	      Pro manual about how they work). 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      One interesting thing to note: unlike the Ableton Push
	      2, the LP Pro actually has "brains". Besides "Session"
	      mode (which is controlled by the DAW), there are 3 other
	      modes you can use: "Note", "Chord" and "Sequencer" all
	      of which function without any involvement by the
	      DAW. The LP Pro has its own fairly sophisticated MIDI
	      recorder/sequencer, and the Chord mode can be used to
	      build up progressions in an easy to perform way. The
	      modes work with Ardour just as they would in any other
	      DAW, and you can find fairly good documentation on them
	      in the LP Pro manual. There's a particularly thorough
	      playlist of
	      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_kRkcZ1CjihzcBrIO_x0JdqgwO9gKu9J">video
	      tutorials</a> on the Sequencer mode.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      We hope to announce support for the LP Pro's junior cousins, the
	      LP Mini and LP X, in the not too distant future.

      <h2>Quick Groups</h2>
    </p>
      
	<div>
	  
	  <div>
	    <p>
	      For a long time, Ardour has had track &amp; bus groups
	      which could be set to share features like solo state,
	      record-enable and so on. There are also VCAs to provide
	      a different type of shared control. These were (and are!) powerful,
	      but many users have expressed a desire for more
	      spontaneous "group operations", particularly in the mixer.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      For Ardour 8.0, we have redesigned this fundamental
	      behavior of many controls so that they now apply most
	      changes to all selected tracks &amp; busses. This
	      includes: gain (fader) and input trim changes as well as
	      solo/mute/rec-enable/solo-safe/solo-isolate/monitoring
	      controls.
	    </p>
	  </div>

	  </p>
	  
	</div>
  </div>

<div>
      <p>
	Of course, if you have a group with the selection sharing property
	enabled, selecting a member of the group will select all of them, and
	then the "operate on selection" model will apply to the group.
      </p>
      <p>
	The new design allows a lot more flexibility. You can:
      </p>
	<ul>
	  <li>not use groups at all, just select the tracks/busses/mixer strips.</li>
	  <li>use groups but leave selection sharing enabled so that grouping &amp;
	    selection "look" the same (i.e. selecting 1 member of the group
	    selects all.</li>
	  <li>use groups but leave selection sharing disabled, allowing you to still
	    select specific members of the group (and non-members) to operate
	    on.</li>
	</ul>
      <p>
	Note that these changes will also apply to the editor
	tab/window, for whatever relevant controls are visible there.
      </p>
      <p>
	Two small notes on this: first, this behavior will not
	happen when the changes to various controls come from a
	hardware control surface. This may or may not change in
	the future - hardware control surfaces tend to have
	different conventions for use than mouse-driven
	GUIs. Second, this also will not work if you use the
	mouse scroll wheel to adjust faders. We will likely
	"fix" this sometime during the 8.x series.
      </p>
    </div>

<div>
    <p>
      <h2>Region Grouping</h2>
    </p>

    <div>
	<p>
	  Another long standing user request has been the ability to select
	  several regions and "group" them so that they will all move or trim
	  together. Ardour 8.0 now allows this: select more than 1 region, then
	  right click on any of them, and select "Group" from the context menu
	  (or simply press <code>Ctrl-g</code> (<code>Cmd-g</code> on macOS).
	</p>
	<p>
	  Regions recorded at the same time are grouped by default so they can
	  be edited together.

      <h2>Freehand automation drawing</h2>
    </p>
    <div>
    <p>
      Ardour has for decades supported sample-accurate automation with both manual entry of control points and full automation recording. However, more than a few users have asked for the ability to use the mouse/touchpad to "draw" freehand lines rather than create them point by point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ardour 8.0 adds this style of automation drawing for any/all
      automations, including regular parameters, but also for
      per-region gain and finally MIDI CC data.
    </p>
    <p>The old (and still available) point-by-point automation
      drawing style is recommended for many things, due to reduced
      CPU load and less issues with plugins.</p>
    <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="">
      <source src="https://ardour.org/images/oldautodraw.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      <source src="https://ardour.org/images/oldautodraw.webm" type="video/webm">
    </video>
    <p>The new freehand drawing style is sometimes faster to
      draw and may feel more natural to some users. Remember,
      however, that Ardour can interpolate between points, and most
      plugins will always interpolate changes in parameter values, so
      although this may "look" nicer, it's not necessarily any better
      at providing the automation "shape" you think you want.</p>

      <h2>Tempo Mapping, Round 2 — the Grid Tool</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you compose/work entirely "in the box" and/or always work
      with a click track or visual grid as a reference, most DAWs
      (including Ardour) will help you get things lined up, even
      you're leaning into Dillah-style grooves. 
    </p>
    <p>
      But if you are dealing with recordings of human performances,
      you're likely to find that no fixed grid can help you with the
      little speed ups and slow downs that give a lot of music its
      distinct feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've looked at the solutions offered by a bunch of other DAWs
      and found them all lacking. If you try to automate the task of
      adjusting the tempo to follow a human performance (e.g. by
      tracking transients/onsets), you
      invariably end up with a mess that you still need to manually
      fix up.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Ardour 8.0, we are proud to offer an approach to this
      problem that we think combines the best of both worlds: switch
      to the Grid tool (shortcut: "y") and simply
      drag the grid (lines) to fit the measure and beat onsets that
      you feel while listening. Start by working from the left/earlier to the
      right/later,  and then head back and tweak
      any specific beat lines that don't seem quite right.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      While this won't be useful to four-on-the-floor techno
      producers, for those working with human performances not tied to
      a click track, the result is a tempo map (and grid) that
      precisely follows the human, making it easy to align other
      material and/or generate new (MIDI) tracks that also follow the
      performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The combination of Ardour's functionality and your
      listening ability also allows you to respect particularly slack
      timing done for musical effect. Maybe the transients for the
      down beat of a given measure are not "on beat", but you can
      sense that and leave the tempo/pulse alone. The resulting grid
      accommodates the way people actually perform, rather than how
      software sometimes thinks they ought to.

      <h2>MIDI Arpeggiator Plugins</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to Dr. Albert Gräf, Ardour now comes with three MIDI arpeggiator plugins, which
      are intended to be added to a MIDI track before the instrument plugin. All 3 arpeggiators come
      with a number of factory presets which demonstrate their use. Dr. Gräf also provides a
       <a href="https://github.com/agraef/ardour-lua"> more detailed description</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The default <em>Arpeggiator</em> is a traditional monophonic arpeggiator which takes chords as
      MIDI input and turns them into arpeggios when transport is rolling. The arpeggiator is sample
      accurate, follows the tempo map and offers various controls to let you modify parameters such as
      velocities, octave range, and pattern mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>Barlow Arp</em> (after Clarence Barlow) automatically utilizes the current time
      signature and division to produce rhythmic accents in accordance with the meter by varying the
      note velocities in a given range.</p>
    <p>
      Last but not least, the <em>Raptor: The Random Arpeggiator</em> is an advanced arpeggiator
	with random note generation, harmonic controls, input pitch and velocity tracking, as well
	as automatic modulation of various parameters. Raptor has many more parameters than the
	other two plugins and is thus more difficult to use, but can also produce much more varied
	output.
    </p>

      <h2>Improvements and Bug Fixes</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>Disable translation by default on Windows &amp;

      <h2>Removals</h2>
      <p>
	There comes a point in all long-lived software where the best
	thing for users and developers is the removal of certain
	functionality that was either ill-conceived or poorly
	implemented. Ardour 8.0 is no different, and features these removals:
      </p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Remove option to hide or deactivate tempo map
	  markers. The potential for confusion or even madness from
	  this option became clear, and we opted for sanity.</li>
	  <li><p>Remove option to "glue to bars &amp; beats".</p><p> For
	    the time being, MIDI regions and data always use musical time
	    (bars, beats) for their position and length. Audio tracks and
	    regions use audio time (samples) for their position and
	      length.</p><p> Location markers and named ranges use the <em>session
	      default time domain</em> (music or audio) and will follow that setting if you
	    change it.</p></li>
	  <li>Remove the  essentially useless "Audition tool". Use the
	    audition action instead (bound to "a"), which also handles
	    multiple selected regions properly).</li>
	  <li>Remove attempt at scrub-dragging (sort of like a tape
	  machine). This never worked well, and just isn't relevant to
	    a generation raised without much exposure to "rockin' the
	    reels"</li>
	</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="content:encoded"><p><b>OAKLAND&nbsp;</b>— California Attorney General Rob Bonta today issued a statement in response to Senate Bill 478 (SB 478), a bill that&nbsp;he&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-senator-dodd-senator-skinner-introduce-bill-prohibiting" target="_blank">sponsored</a>,&nbsp;being signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom. Coauthored by Senator Bill Dodd (D-Napa) and Senator Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley), the legislation will prohibit hidden fees (also called ‘junk fees’) in California beginning on July 1, 2024. Hidden fees are fees in which a seller uses an artificially low headline price to attract a customer and usually either discloses additional required fees in smaller print, or reveals additional unavoidable charges later in the buying process.</p>
<p>“Today, California is eliminating hidden fees,”&nbsp;<b>said Attorney General Rob Bonta</b>. “These deceptive fees prevent us from knowing how much we will be charged at the outset.&nbsp;They&nbsp;are bad for consumers and bad for competition. They cost Americans tens of billions of dollars each year. They hit families who are just trying to make ends meet the hardest. And, because a growing list of websites, apps, and brick-and-mortar businesses are using them, they penalize companies that are upfront and transparent with their prices. With the signing of SB 478, California now has the most effective piece of legislation in the nation to tackle this problem. The price Californians see will be the price they pay. I am deeply grateful to Senators Dodd and Skinner, the authors of SB 478, for their commitment to protecting consumers.”</p>
<p>“With the governor’s signing of this historic bill, we can finally take aim at dishonest junk fees that are tacked onto seemingly everything – from online concert tickets to hotel reservations,”&nbsp;<b>said Senator&nbsp;Bill Dodd</b>. “Now we can put the consumer first and create a level playing field for those businesses that advertise the real price, up front. I appreciate everyone who worked to end these dishonest charges that boost corporate profits at the expense of those who can least afford it.”</p>
<p>“California sent a clear message today: The days of bait-and-switch pricing practices are over,”&nbsp;<b>said Senator&nbsp;Nancy Skinner</b>. “With Gov. Newsom’s signing of SB 478, Californians will know up front how much they’re being asked to pay, and no longer be surprised by hidden junk fees when buying a concert or sports ticket or booking hotel rooms for their family vacation.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>After announcing that he was sponsoring SB 478 in February 2023, Attorney General Bonta&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-california-heeding-president-biden%E2%80%99s-call-end-hidden-fees" target="_blank">urged</a>&nbsp;the California Legislature to approve the legislation in March 2023, heeding the call from the Biden-Harris Administration and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for states to better address the nationwide concern of hidden fees. In May 2023, he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB3vvw2sbF0" target="_blank">held a press conference</a>&nbsp;in San Diego to highlight the bill’s importance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deceptive price advertising&nbsp;is a significant problem facing consumers that appears to be proliferating in more and more sectors of the economy.&nbsp;Hidden&nbsp;required fees are&nbsp;now charged for a variety of goods and services, such as lodging, tickets for live events, and&nbsp;restaurants and food delivery.&nbsp;These fees, when mandatory, are&nbsp;a deceptive way of hiding the true price of a good or service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The text of the legislation is available&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB478" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the thought of handwriting code seems silly, it might surprise you to know that it’s inevitable. If you’re unsure, think about the last job interview you did, and remember how there was no computer around in the interview room — just your interviewers, a blank sheet of paper, and a blue ball-point pen.</p>



<p>For the students among you, it’s even a bigger deal as your grades hang in by the lines of code you had strategically squeezed into the available space in your answer sheet.</p>



<p>And not just that, experienced programmers can point you to the bundle of A4 sheets they had removed from the office copy machine to scribble down a particularly complex algorithm they had been working on.</p>



<p>So whether you’re an exam student, potential job interviewee, or someone wanting to resolve their programming dead ends, I hope this article helps you out when you put your pen to the paper to code.</p>



<p>Although I will focus on the analog aspect of writing code, you can apply these steps to coding in any form or language. So consider this to be also like a generic coding guideline that works specifically for me but can also be very useful to you in your work.</p>


<h3 id="why-write-it-down">Why write it down?</h3>


<p>Before we start, it’s essential to understand that no one expects you to jot down production-ready code in a notebook. It’s not like you can drop that into a code editor and compile it without an error. If producing perfect code was the goal, you would be seated in front of a computer in the interview rooms and exam halls.</p>



<p>The purpose of handwriting code is to work through logic in advance. There’s s desire to “get in the browser” as soon as possible in design, but there is conventional wisdom in sketching designs by hand. A low-fidelity medium encourages quick experimentation and inexpensive mistakes.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="2560" height="2560" src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-2-scaled.jpg?resize=2560%2C2560&amp;ssl=1" alt="White lined paper with cursive handwritten notes on using :nth-child." srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-2-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-2-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-2-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-2-scaled.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-2-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-2-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-2-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The toil of trying to figure out how to affect surrounding items with one click (from my <a href="https://css-tricks.com/conditionally-styling-selected-elements-in-a-grid-container/">last article</a>)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The same can be true of code, mainly when working out syntax and semantics. That said, getting the correct syntax and semantics is <em>always</em> a plus point, though not the sole focus of the whole handwriting exercise.</p>



<p>Let’s see where we can start when it comes to handwriting code.</p>


<h3 id="know-your-question">Know your question</h3>


<p>During my final year in college, I couldn’t do an internship or even attend campus interviews because of health reasons. As a result, my very first job interview was quite literal with high stakes.</p>



<p>When I look back now, the interview was pretty easy. But having never attended one before, I was anxious beyond reason. The first thing the interviewers asked about programming was if I could output an inverted triangle made of asterisks. As I said, it was easy — nothing a <code>for</code> loop can’t handle, right? But like I said, my anxiety was through the roof as well.</p>



<p>I took a deep breath, pressed my palm against the blank sheet of paper they had laid out for me, slid it as slow as possible towards me on the table (buying time, of course), clicked the pen, and then I did something right.</p>



<p>I first drew an inverted triangle made of asterisks. That’s how I found my feet on the ground to start answering their question.</p>



<p>I’ve seen otherwise brilliant developers get something wrong simply because they never fully grasp what it is they are solving.</p>



<p>The questions we work with are not like the questions physicists or mathematicians solve. They get a set of parameters and find the missing ones; our questions are also our results. We are already told what our results are —  we have to figure out how to reach them. That’s why it’s imperative to know the question well because you’ll see the result.</p>



<p>Writing down or drawing out what you want to output is one of the best ways to start your coding. I understand that in our fast-paced industry, the expectation is that we have to jump right into the programming by running a “hello world” demo. And that’s great to familiarize yourself with an unfamiliar syntax and shake off your anxiousness about trying something new.</p>



<p>But when someone asks you a question and gives you a result to work up to, wouldn’t it just be better to put that down first? That question/result is not only your starting point but also your point of reference. At any step in your coding, you can look at it to ensure you’re working towards it and that you’re on the right track.</p>



<p>So whether in your answer sheets or in that blank A4 paper you’re about to write in, start by taking a second and writing down what it is you’re trying to output. You can put it in the margins or a corner if you don’t want it to be a part of your answer. Just make sure it’s somewhere where you can keep referencing it.</p>


<h3 id="outline-your-code">Outline your code</h3>


<p>This step is like a double-edged sword. It can get you a roadmap to your program or waste your time. My job is to make sure it’s the former.</p>



<p>So, first and foremost, I like to say: <strong>outlining code is unnecessary if the scope of your problem or question is small.</strong> Again, this practice is neither prescriptive nor universal to all projects or situations. Imagine I’m your interviewer, and I ask you to write how to center an element in a web page using CSS in as many ways as possible. You won’t exactly be needing an outline for this. The code snippets are relatively small for each method.</p>



<p>But now, let’s say I assign you to write a web application that captures user signatures via a touchscreen interface and then saves the signature on the server. Not so straightforward, right? You’ve more than one thing to figure out. Perhaps, a little outline can help.</p>



<ol><li>UI for capturing signature — HTML Canvas? WebGL?</li><li>Disable pointer events on the rest of the web page when the user is signing</li><li>Convert and save the captured image to a PNG file — JS</li><li>Then convert it to blob (maybe) and save it to the visitor’s log data table.</li></ol>



<p>I’ve written a rough sequence of actions I think I might have to code. It could’ve been shorter or longer, depending on what I wanted from it.</p>



<p>I highly recommend outlining code for client projects. Write the outline along with your user requirements or on the back of wireframes you’ve printed out.</p>



<p>Your quick snapshot of bullet points gives you a map, a to-do list, and a checklist to verify against when you reach the end of the project — pretty much your whole project’s summary in a low-fidelity list. It can also become a template to start your next similar project.</p>



<p>But like I said before, this step is like a double-edged sword. You’ll have to keep this short for examinees and interviewees when there are time constraints.</p>



<p>If you don’t know where to start, write down just three essential functions you’ll have to code in your application, and if you have got the time, make it five.</p>



<p>But that’s about it. Spend as little time as possible on this, and don’t sweat over the details. The outline is not going to score you extra points. It’s there only to help you make sure you have everything covered. It captures your initial gut reaction and keeps you honest throughout the project’s life.</p>

<p>Time to start coding. So, what do you write? “Bdrs” or “<code>border-radius</code>“; “<code>div -&gt; p</code>” or “<code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>“; “<code>pl()</code>” or “<code>println()</code>“; “<code>q()</code>” or “<code>querySelector()</code>“?</p>



<p>If someone else is grading your code, then there’s no choice. Leave out abbreviations, pseudo-codes, Emmet shortcuts, and any other form of shorthand writing. Otherwise, there’s no reason to assume that anyone reading this knows what your abbreviations mean.</p>



<p>It’s really up to you.</p>



<p>If you’ve gotten out of touch with writing by hand — and many of us have — it’s better not to go overboard with the longhand notations, as they get tedious. At the same time, there’s no such thing as being too frugal with your writing. Not if you want to be able to look back on it one day and understand what you’d written down.</p>



<p>I have an open file in my note-taking app and a lined notepad on my desk where I write down code snippets I want to save for later reference. They are unorganized, just a long stream of snippets. That’s why when I browse through older notes, I wouldn’t know what I meant to write if I had not written them down clearly.</p>



<p>I forget syntaxes all the time. For instance, I’ve been using the arrow notation for JavaScript functions since it was introduced (because it’s shorter), and I’m pretty sure if someone suddenly asks me to define a function using the <code>function</code> keyword, I might even misplace the parentheses or the function name, inciting a syntax error.</p>



<p>It’s not unusual for us to forget syntaxes we haven’t used in a while. That’s why it’s better to write your notes clearly when you know you need them for future reference.</p>


<h3 id="the-nonsequential-flow-of-code">The non-sequential flow of code</h3>


<p>Unlike the last step, which doesn’t apply to those of you interviewees and test-takers, this one is catered especially to you.</p>



<p>Most programming languages are interpreted, compiled, and executed so that sometimes pre-written code in the source is executed later when called. We do it in JavaScript, for example, with function calling — functions can be defined initially, then executed later. Examinees and interviewees can use this to start working on the critical point of your answer first.</p>



<p>As I’ve said from the very beginning, the purpose of handwriting code is to work through or test the logic of whatever it is you program. It’s best when you focus on resolving that first.</p>



<p>Let’s take a classic textbook example — a program to find the nth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number" rel="noopener">Fibonacci number</a>. If I were to write a simple outline for it, it would be something like this:</p>



<ol><li>Get the input.</li><li>Calculate the Fibonacci number.</li><li>Summarise the output.</li><li>Print the output.</li></ol>



<p>All the steps in that outline are essential; however, 1, 3, and 4 are more obligatory. They are necessary but not important enough to focus on right away.</p>



<p>It’s better to start writing down the code to calculate the Fibonacci number rather than to fetch the input. Wrap it in a function, then go ahead and write the code sequentially and write down a line to call that function where appropriate.</p>



<p>Spend your time writing code that focuses on the heart of the problem.</p>



<p>Real professionals can skip ahead. Let’s say I have a client project, and I have to work with some triangle geometry — got two sides, opposite angle, and gotta find the third side’s length. And I’ve decided to scribble on paper to get started rather than opening my <abbr title="integrated development environment">IDE</abbr>.</p>



<p>First, I would draw the triangle, of course (that’s something I’m very experienced with, as you can tell). I would write down some sample lengths and angles. Then I’d write the formula (compliments of online searching, for sure), and then I’d jump right to the code for the function.</p>



<p>There’s no point in me writing down the obligatory steps even though I’ll need them in production-ready code. But it would be different if I had to write that on an answer sheet in an exam. I can’t skip the other steps; however, I can still start with the code for the formula.</p>


<h3 id="pseudocode">Pseudo-code</h3>


<p>Chris has already written a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/pseudo-code/">handy article on pseudo-code</a> that I highly recommend you give a solid read.</p>



<p>For all those professionals who feel like the whole handwriting code thing doesn’t seem like your cup of tea but still might be curious if it can help you, then <strong>pseudo-code</strong> might be the balance you’re looking for.</p>



<p>It’s similar to outlining the code, as I mentioned in one of the previous steps. However, it’s briefer and feels more like shorthand coding. It’s sometimes also referred to as “skeleton code.”</p>



<p>Here’s some quick pseudo-code for a CSS grid layout:</p>



<pre rel="" data-line=""><code markup="tt">Grid
5 60px rows
6 100px columns</code></pre>



<p>There isn’t much to write! So, even though putting a pencil to paper is excellent for this sort of thing, it’s just as effective, fast, and inexpensive to jot some pseudo code into whatever program you’re using.</p>


<h3 id="space-and-comments">Space and comments</h3>


<p>I believe code is 90% keywords and 10% tabs. Withoutspacesthereadabilityofwordsdecreases. Indentations are necessary for handwritten code as well. However, please don’t use it for every level because the width of the paper will limit you. Use spaces judiciously, but use them.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="2560" height="2560" src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-3-scaled.jpg?resize=2560%2C2560&amp;ssl=1" alt="Yellow unlined paper with code handwritten in cursive in black ink." srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-3-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-3-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-3-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-3-scaled.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-3-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-3-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-3-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Prized OG snippet, written with extra TLC</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’re writing code for your use, I also believe that if you’ve followed everything I’ve mentioned so far and have already written down your output and an outline on the page, you may not even need to include comments. Comments tell you quickly what its following set of code does. If you have already written and read an outline for the code, then comments are redundant notes.</p>



<p>However, if your judgment says to put down one, then do it. Add it to the right side of the code (since you won’t be able to insert it between already written lines the way you could in, say, VS Code). Use forward slashes, brackets, or arrows to denote that they are comments.</p>



<p>For examinees who are unconfident with a certain syntax, write down comments. This way, at least, you’re letting the person grading your paper know your intention with that incorrectly formatted code. And use only the correct delimiters to denote comments — for example, that would be the forward slashes for JavaScript.</p>


<h3 id="analog-vs-digital">Analog vs. digital</h3>


<p>As I mentioned earlier, everything I’m providing here can is generic coding advice. If you don’t want to try this with physical paper, any note-taking application also works.</p>



<p>But if you’re going to try the digital route, my recommendation is to try using something other than a straight note-taking app. Work with more visual digital tools — flow diagrams, mind maps, wireframes, etc. They can help you visualize your result, the outlines, and the code itself.</p>



<p>I am not much of a digital citizen (except for working on the web and recently converting to reading e-books), so I stick to physical notebooks.</p>


<h3 id="my-favorite-tools-for-handwriting-code">My favorite tools for handwriting code</h3>


<p>Any pencil and paper will do! But there are lots of options out there, and these are a few choice tools I use:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staedtler-Pigment-Liner-0-3mm-308-0-3/dp/B00AHW572W" rel="noopener">Staedtler Pigment Liner 0.3mm</a> (Black)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mitsubishi-Pencil-ballpoint-stream-SXN220007-24/dp/B00O4P5CI2/ref=sr_1_5?crid=SN007BBRD9TB&amp;keywords=Mitsubishi+JETSTREAM+101+0.7&amp;qid=1658334470&amp;s=office-products&amp;sprefix=mitsubishi+jetstream+101+0.7%2Coffice-products%2C99&amp;sr=1-5" rel="noopener">Mitsubishi JETSTREAM 101 0.7mm</a> (Black)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/MUJI-Blank-Notebook-Unruled-30sheets/dp/B00IQQE5EM/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3EQV4ID50LZ56&amp;keywords=MUJI+Notebook+A5&amp;qid=1658334618&amp;s=office-products&amp;sprefix=muji+notebook+a5%2Coffice-products%2C101&amp;sr=1-5" rel="noopener">MUJI Notebook A5 6mm Rule 30 sheets</a> (Lightweight and easy to carry)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/MUJI-Twin-Tip-Highlighter-3-colors-Pack/dp/B0736YVQBC/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3A01WD7YWRCWY&amp;keywords=MUJI+Twin-Tip+Highlighter&amp;qid=1658334679&amp;s=office-products&amp;sprefix=muji+twin-tip+highlighter%2Coffice-products%2C88&amp;sr=1-2" rel="noopener">MUJI Twin-Tip Highlighter Pen</a> (Yellow)</li></ul>


<h3 id="there-is-no-write-way-to-code">There is no “write” way to code</h3>


<p>I hope, if nothing else, my little way of handwriting code with pencil and paper makes you evaluate the way you already plan and write code. I like knowing how other developers approach their work, and this is my way of giving you a peek into the way I do things.</p>



<p>Again, nothing here is scientific or an exact art. But if you want to give handwritten code planning a try, here’s everything we’ve covered in a nice ordered list:</p>



<ol><li>Start by writing down (with sample data, if needed) the output of your code.</li><li>Write an outline for the code. Please keep it to three steps for small projects or ones that are less complex.</li><li>Use longhand notations. Developers writing for themselves can use shorthand notations as long as the writing is legible and makes sense to you when you refer to it later.</li><li>When under a time constraint, consider writing the code that tackles the heart of the problem first. Later, write down a call to that code at the right place in your sequential code.</li><li>If you feel confident, try writing pseudo code addressing the main idea.</li><li>Use proper indentations and spaces — and be mindful of the paper’s width.</li></ol>



<p>That’s it! When you’re ready to try writing code by hand, I hope this article makes it easy for you to start. And if you’re sitting down for an exam or an interview, I hope this helps you focus on getting the questions right.</p>

<p>Flexoki is an inky color scheme for prose and code. Flexoki is designed for reading and writing on digital screens. It is inspired by analog printing inks and warm shades of paper.</p>

<p>Flexoki is minimalistic and high-contrast. The colors are calibrated for legibility and perceptual balance across devices and when switching between light and dark modes.</p>

<p>Flexoki is <a href="https://github.com/kepano/flexoki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-source</a> under the MIT license. You can try Flexoki with my <a href="https://stephango.com/obsidian">Obsidian</a> theme <a href="https://stephango.com/minimal">Minimal</a>.</p>

<h2 id="color-palette">Color palette</h2>

<p>Flexoki is the color palette used on this site. To switch between light and dark mode press the <strong>D</strong> key or use the toggle at the top of the page. Click the swatches to copy a color to your clipboard.</p>







<h2 id="base-tones">Base tones</h2>

<p>Flexoki uses warm monochromatic base tones that blend the black ink tone with the base paper tone. 8 colors are used in light and dark mode:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>3 text colors:</strong> normal, muted, faint</li>
  <li>
<strong>3 interface colors:</strong> normal, hover, active</li>
  <li>
<strong>2 background colors:</strong> primary, secondary</li>
</ul>

<p>Incremental values can be derived using opacity. For example, you can use a 60% opacity black tone on top of the paper tone to create the 600 value.</p>

<h2 id="colors">Colors</h2>

<p>8 colors are available for accents and syntax highlighting. Each color is available in two tones calibrated for light and dark modes.</p>

<p>In the future, a full range of tones from 50 to 950 will be added. Unlike the base tones, colors cannot be blended using opacity because this desaturates the pigment effect. More on this topic below.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>I created Flexoki for my personal site, <a href="https://stephango.com/">stephango.com</a>. You’re reading it now. I wanted the colors to feel distinctive yet familiar. Like ink on paper.</p>

<p>The name Flexoki comes from <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flexography</a></em> — a common printing process for paper and cardboard<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I spent many years working with dyes and inks particularly for my companies <a href="https://stephango.com/inkodye">Inkodye</a> and <a href="https://stephango.com/lumi">Lumi</a>. I also have a fascination with <a href="https://stephango.com/the-elusiveness-of-digital-paper">digital paper</a>. I wanted to bring the comfort of analog color to emissive digital screens.</p>

<p>One challenge is that ink on paper is a subtractive process whereas LCD and OLED screens use additive color. Replicating the effect of mixing pigments digitally is difficult. The following video illustrates the problem:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6JVjHqas60Q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><small>See the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qa5iWdfNKg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full SIGGRAPH 2021 talk</a></small></p>

<p>Mixing blue and yellow paint creates green, whereas digital color mixing results in a brownish hue. Watercolors retain their saturation when you dilute them, whereas reducing the opacity of digital colors makes them look desaturated.</p>

<p>Another challenge with digital color is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_color_spaces_and_their_uses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">human perception</a> across color spaces. For example, yellow appears much brighter than blue. Ethan Schoonover’s color scheme <a href="https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solarized</a> (2011) was an important inspiration for Flexoki. His emphasis on CIELAB lightness relationships helped me understand how to find colors that appear cohesive.</p>

<p>I found that choosing colors with perfect perceptual consistency can be at odds with the distinctiveness of colors in practical applications like syntax highlighting. If you adhere too closely to evenness in perceptual lightness you can end up with a palette that looks washed out and difficult to parse.</p>

<p>Solving for all these problems is how I arrived at Flexoki. I wish it could have been more science than art, but it wasn’t. Some day I hope to arrive at a more reliable way to generate digital color palettes that respect the constraints I laid out. In the meantime, I hope you find this iteration of Flexoki useful.</p>

href="https://www.theverge.com/23725039/framework-laptop-13-2023-intel-review">modular repairable laptops</a> — first, it sent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/19/23312697/lenovo-framework-laptop-power-button-trademark-infringement">a cease-and-desist over a Framework power button</a>, then it unveiled its own modular concept laptop dubbed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/17/23797765/lenovo-ponders-repairable-laptops-with-project-aurora">Project Aurora</a> with no promise to actually build such a thing.</p></div><p>But it looks like the ThinkPad and Motorola owner might actually be serious about ramping up repairability. “More than 80 percent of our devices will be able to be repaired at the customer,” Lenovo executive Luca Rossi told the Canalys EMEA Forum 2023, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/05/lenovo_pc_boss_4_in/">according to <em>The Register</em></a>.</p><p>“Batteries, SSD, many things will not any longer be sealed into the product but will be available for the customer to be to repaired on site and then save a lot of waste,” he reportedly said. </p><p>Lenovo is just one of many companies that have suddenly increased their efforts on repairability and sustainability, and it isn’t coming out of the goodness of companies’ hearts — the economic and political climate has swiftly changed. </p><div><p>Apple went from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525542/apple-right-to-repair-bill-california-lobbyist-comptia">vehemently and sneakily lobbying against right-to-repair bills</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23843506/apple-california-right-to-repair-sb-244">suddenly supporting those efforts</a>. Prominent right-to-repair advocates <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23017361/ifixit-right-to-repair-parts-google-samsung-valve-microsoft">told me in 2022</a> that Samsung and Google were convinced when they saw a shift in consumer behavior combined with the imminent threat of legislation. </p></div><div><p>In 2023, it’s no longer just a threat. The European Union has recently shown that it has the power to force companies to change their products — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/7/23156361/european-union-usb-c-wired-charging-iphone-lightning-ewaste">it’s the reason</a> we now have a USB-C port on the iPhone 15. Next, it may force <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/24/23771064/european-union-battery-regulation-ecodesign-user-replacable-batteries">smartphone manufacturers to make their batteries easier to replace</a>.
