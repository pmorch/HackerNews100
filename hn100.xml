<h2 id="w_how-to-run-firefox-on-chromeos">How to run Firefox on ChromeOS</h2>
<p>To run Firefox on ChromeOS, you first need to ensure that your system meets the following requirements:
</p>
<h2 id="w_system-requirements">System Requirements</h2>
<ul><li><strong>x86 based Chromebook running ChromeOS 80 or later</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>You can check this by going to <code>chrome://version</code> in the Chrome browser address bar. <a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/177889">Follow these instructions from Google</a> if you need to upgrade your OS.
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Enable Linux support for ChromeOS</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439">Click here</a> to learn more about how to set up Linux (Beta) on your Chromebook.
</p><p>Once you've enabled Linux, check the Terminal to see if you have the correct version:
</p><p><code>cat /etc/os-release</code>
</p><p>If the version is not 10 (buster) or above, you'll need to run the update script:
</p><p><code>sudo bash /opt/google/cros-containers/bin/upgrade_container</code>
</p><p>This script will take some time depending on how fast your Chromebook and internet speeds are. Once it's done, you'll need to restart your Linux container. You can either right click the <em>Terminal</em> icon and select <strong>Shut down Linux (Beta)</strong> or just restart your Chromebook.
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Enable Flatpak</strong>
</li></ul>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  We successfully synthesized polycrystalline LK-99-like ceramic samples with a
solid-state-sintering method. Powder X-ray diffraction shows that the main
contents are $\mathrm{Pb_{10-x}Cu_x(PO_4)_6O}$ and $\mathrm{Cu_2S}$, consistent
with recent reports [<a data-arxiv-id="2307.12037" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12037">arXiv:2307.12037</a>; <a data-arxiv-id="2308.01192" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01192">arXiv:2308.01192</a>]. In some small flaky
fragments, we successfully observed ``half levitation'' atop a
$\mathrm{Nd_2Fe_{14}B}$ magnet. Using magnetization measurements on such small
pieces, as well as on a large piece which does not exhibit the half levitation,
we show that the samples ubiquitously contain weak yet definitive soft
ferromagnetic components. We argue that, together with the pronounced shape
anisotropy of the small fragments, the soft ferromagnetism is sufficient to
explain the observed half levitation in strong vertical magnetic fields. Our
measurements do not indicate the presence of the Meissner effect, nor zero
resistance, in our samples, leading us to believe that our samples do not
exhibit superconductivity.

            <span>Abstract:</span>  The report of synthesis of modified Lead apatite (LK-99) with evidence of
superconductivity at more than boiling water temperature has steered the whole
scientific community. There have been several failures to reproduce
superconductivity in LK-99 including partial successes. Here, we have continued
our efforts to synthesize phase pure LK-99 with improved precursors. The
process has been followed as suggested by Sukbae Lee et. al., [1,2]. The phase
purity of each precursor is evidenced by Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and
well fitted by Rietveld refinement. The PXRD confirms the synthesis of phase
pure polycrystalline LK-99 with apatite structure. The freshly synthesized
sample does not show any signature of superconductivity levitation on a magnet
(diamagnetism). The magnetization measurements on SQUID also show that LK-99 is
diamagnetic at 280 K, there is no sign of superconductivity in LK-99 at room
temperature. Moreover, we have also performed first principle calculations to
investigate the electronic band structure of the LK-99 near Fermi level. Our
study verifies that the Cu doped lead apatite (LK-99) has bands crossing at
Fermi level, indicating generation of strong correlation in the system.

<p>Malignant melanoma, a dangerous type of skin cancer, deploys an elegant molecular mechanism to evade natural immune responses and the therapies intended to boost them, according to new work led by scientists at the <a href="https://www.cancer.columbia.edu/cancer.columbia.edu">Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> (HICCC). The findings, published in the current issue of Cancer Cell, explain how these tumors resist an important class of treatments, and suggests new strategies for attacking this and possibly other types of cancer as well.</p>
<p>Normally, the immune system eliminates abnormal cells, but cancers can elude it in various ways. For the past few years, <a href="https://www.cancer.columbia.edu/profile/benjamin-izar-md">Benjamin Izar, MD, PhD</a>, assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University <a href="https://www.vagelos.columbia.edu/">Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons</a> and a member of the HICCC, has been studying how malignant melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, hides itself from immune cells. Initially, Izar’s team identified a signature pattern of gene expression changes associated with melanoma’s apparent cloaking device. “This signature was composed of a couple of hundred genes, so it was difficult to prioritize which of these may be the major functional driver,” says Izar.</p>
<p>More recent experiments singled out a cell surface protein called CD58; in laboratory experiments, tumor cells that suppressed their CD58 expression got much better at escaping immune surveillance. CD58 stimulates T cells, white blood cells especially important for anti-tumor responses. “The activity of T cells is regulated in a variety of ways, so they eliminate cancer or infected cells, but don’t go overboard causing damage to normal tissues,” says Izar. The findings hinted at how melanomas might be hiding from T cells, but didn’t provide the whole story. “This was the basis for asking ‘what are the mechanisms by which CD58 loss may drive cancer immune evasion?’” says Izar, who is the senior author on the new paper.</p>
<p>Izar’s team, including a network of collaborators at institutions across the US and Europe, developed several new techniques to find the answer. To validate their earlier laboratory results, the scientists analyzed samples from melanoma patients before and during treatment with immune-targeting therapies, confirming that real tumors decrease CD58 expression while evading immunity. Meanwhile, “Patricia Ho, an outstanding MD/PhD student in my lab, performed a cool [molecular and cellular] analysis to identify, in an unbiased fashion, the key regulator of CD58: [the protein] CMTM6,” says Izar. The investigators also developed a special mouse model carrying specific human genes and cell types to see exactly how CD58, CMTM6, and other proteins operate in tumors facing the immune system in real time.</p>
<p>The results show that CMTM6 acts as a stabilizer, inhibiting the degradation of both CD58, which stimulates T cell activity, and another cell surface protein called PD-L1, which inhibits it. In fact, these two opposing signaling proteins compete with each other for CMTM6, so by reducing the amount of the pro-T cell CD58, tumor cells free up more of the CMTM6 to stabilize the anti-T cell PD-L1. “This is a double whammy to T cell activity: loss of activation and increased inhibition,” says Izar.</p>
<p>The work helps explain how malignant melanomas readily acquire resistance to immune-targeting therapies and points to ways drug developers might reverse the signaling pattern to restore the tumor’s vulnerability, exchanging its cloaking device for a high-visibility jumpsuit.</p>
<p>“We found, to our knowledge, the first example of a regulatory protein … that balances this yin and yang of immuno-stimulatory and inhibitory signals on cancer cells,” says Izar, adding that “it’s extremely likely that this mechanism is important in other cancers as well.”</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>Hours after this post was published, my Goodreads profile was cleaned of the offending titles. However, the garbage books remain available for sale at Amazon with my name attached.</p>



<p>I did file a report with Amazon, complaining that these books were using my name and reputation without my consent. Amazon’s response: “Please provide us with any trademark registration numbers that relate to your claim.” When I replied that I did not have a trademark for my name, they closed the case and said the books would not be removed from sale.</p>



<hr>



<p>There’s not much that makes me angry these days about writing and publishing. I’ve seen it all. I know what to expect from Amazon and Goodreads. Meaning: I don’t expect much, and I assume I will be continually disappointed. Nor do I have the power to change how they operate. My energy-saving strategy: move on and focus on what you can control.</p>



<p>That’s going to become much harder to do if Amazon and Goodreads don’t start defending against the absolute garbage now being spread across their sites.</p>



<p>I know my work gets pirated and frankly I don’t care. (I’m not saying other authors shouldn’t care, but that’s not a battle worth my time today.)</p>



<p><strong>But here’s what does rankle me: </strong>garbage books getting uploaded to Amazon where my name is credited as the author. (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CDCNNX39?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here’s but one example.</a>) Whoever’s doing this is obviously preying on writers who trust my name and think I’ve actually written these books. I have not. Most likely they’ve been generated by AI.</p>



<p>It might be possible to ignore this nonsense on some level since these books aren’t receiving customer reviews (so far), and mostly they sink to the bottom of search results (although not always). At the very least, if you look at my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Jane-Friedman/author/B004KHXQ0U?ref=ap_rdr&amp;store_ref=ap_rdr&amp;isDramIntegrated=true&amp;shoppingPortalEnabled=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">author profile on Amazon</a>, these junk books don’t appear. A reader who applies some critical thinking might think twice before accepting these books as mine.</p>



<p>Still, it’s not great. And it falls on me, the author—the one with a reputation at stake—to get these misleading books removed from Amazon. I’m not even sure it’s possible. I don’t own the copyright to these junk books. I don’t exactly “own” my name either—lots of other people who are also legit authors share my name, after all. So on what grounds can I successfully demand this stop, at least in Amazon’s eyes? I’m not sure.</p>



<p><strong>To add insult to injury, these sham books are getting added to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/625709.Jane_Friedman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my official Goodreads profile</a>. </strong>A reasonable person might think I control what books are shown on my Goodreads profile, or that I approve them, or at the very least I could have them easily removed. Not so.</p>



<p>If you need to have your Goodreads profile corrected—as far as the books credited to you—you have to reach out to volunteer “librarians” on Goodreads, which requires joining a group, then posting in a comment thread that you want illegitimate books removed from your profile.</p>



<p>When I complained about this on Twitter/X, an author responded that she had to report 29 illegitimate books in just the last week alone. 29!</p>



<p>With the flood of AI content now published at Amazon, sometimes attributed to authors in a misleading or fraudulent manner, how can anyone reasonably expect working authors to spend every week for the rest of their lives policing this? And if authors <em>don’t</em> police it, they will certainly hear about it, from readers concerned about these garbage books, and from readers who credulously bought this crap and have complaints. Or authors might not hear any thing at all, and lose a potential reader forever.</p>



<p>We desperately need guardrails on this landslide of misattribution and misinformation. Amazon and Goodreads, I beg you to create a way to verify authorship, or for authors to easily block fraudulent books credited to them. Do it now, do it quickly.</p>

            <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zor9q000i0ichdt2irj8l@published" data-word-count="100">Call it the Hollywood-labor-organizing version of <em>Avengers Assemble!</em> On the heels of more than a year’s worth of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/a-vfx-artist-on-what-its-like-working-for-marvel.html">damning</a> <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/02/marvel-vfx-workers-on-ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania.html">disclosures</a> around Marvel Studios’ systematic overworking and underpayment of visual-effects workers on its blockbuster movies and streaming series, VFX crews at Marvel have finally petitioned to demand <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/01/inside-the-vfx-union-brewing-in-hollywood.html">union recognition</a> from the studio. On Monday, a group of more than 50 on-set employees filed a petition for an election to be represented by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) with the National Labor Relations Board. The workers are asking for the election to be held as early as August 21.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3m3000h3b6xd2ypja31@published" data-word-count="76">This marks the first time visual-effects professionals have banded together to demand the same rights, wage protections, and professional watchdog oversight enjoyed by workers in almost every other segment of the entertainment industry. The supermajority of Marvel’s 52-member on-set production crew signed authorization cards to indicate they wish to be represented by the powerful labor union representing some 170,000 artisans, technicians, stagehands, and craftspeople across TV, film, and live theater in the United States and Canada.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3of000i3b6x0ofvhhkt@published" data-word-count="64">“For almost half a century, workers in the visual-effects industry have been denied the same protections and benefits their coworkers and crewmates have relied upon since the beginning of the Hollywood film industry,” VFX organizer for IATSE Mark Patch said in a statement. “This is a historic first step for VFX workers coming together with a collective voice demanding respect for what we do.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3q5000j3b6xgo8q7cb1@published" data-word-count="120">In an era when around 90 percent of all films in release feature varying degrees of VFX fine-tuning (and it’s not uncommon for a show like <em>Stranger Things</em> to showcase up to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/stranger-things-vfx-sound-artists-creating-vecna-1235199328/">4,400 visual-effects shots</a> across a single season), workers within the field have remained stubbornly, confoundingly unrepresented by any professional union or guild. While fellow <a href="https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-below-the-line-definition/">below-the-line</a> workers in such divisions as costumes and wardrobe; hair and makeup; lighting, props and paint; and script supervision have been historically championed by IATSE, underappreciated VFX professionals have been unable to claim benefits such as paid overtime and health care, and have been at the mercy of pronounced labor shortages and managers’ unrealistic deadlines — despite the workers’ increasing indispensability within popular culture.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3s5000k3b6xlja3408c@published" data-word-count="52">“Turnaround times don’t apply to us, protected hours don’t apply to us, and pay equity doesn’t apply to us,” said VFX coordinator Bella Huffman. “Visual effects must become a sustainable and safe department for everyone who’s suffered far too long and for all newcomers who need to know they won’t be exploited.”</p>

  

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3u0000l3b6xw4ostcgd@published" data-word-count="124">The petition for voluntary union recognition from Marvel and its parent company, Disney, arrives amid what the Los Angeles <em>Times</em> has taken to calling the “hot labor summer”: a cultural inflection point when both the Writers Guild and Screen Actors Guild are on strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/sag-strike-movies-tv-shows-paused.html">halting productions</a> across Hollywood and throwing the upcoming movie-release corridor into chaos. Just as crucially, however, VFX’s newly strident demands for a seat at the collective-bargaining table also play out against a backdrop of increasing fan displeasure with (and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-movie-review-marvel.html">critical opprobrium</a> toward) the quality of computer-generated imagery in Marvel Studios movies and series, coming perhaps not coincidentally just months after the firing of Marvel’s president of postproduction and VFX, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/04/victoria-alonso-firing-disney-marvel.html">Victoria Alonso</a>.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3w0000m3b6x2ygyuj0m@published" data-word-count="42">Even with the group’s NLRB petition, a VFX workers strike is not out of the question; it is perhaps the most battle-tested and surefire route to union recognition. (Representatives at Disney and Marvel did not respond to requests for comment from Vulture.)</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp3y6000n3b6xff72l4i2@published" data-word-count="116">Leading off the collective-bargaining push with Marvel’s on-set VFX specialists — data wranglers, production managers, witness camera operators, and assistants employed on such MCU series as <a href="https://www.vulture.com/tv/loki/"><em>Loki</em></a> and <em>Daredevil: Born Again, </em>as opposed to the people supplying visual effects in postproduction — arrives as no accident. Thanks to the studio’s fire hose of movie and TV series output (it will oversee the release of five movies and four shows in 2023 alone), Marvel is regarded in VFX circles as the industry’s biggest “bully,” with the capacity to flood effects houses with more work than they know what to do with or ruin careers and standings of those who do not live up to Marvel’s sky-high expectations.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp406000o3b6xbsw691ku@published" data-word-count="188">Hence, as the thinking goes, securing union recognition for a relatively small yet high-profile group of Marvel’s so-called “production-side” professionals would stand as proof of concept for the overall viability of an industry-wide unionization push. Production-side unity would lead to solidarity at postproduction houses, which would then, in turn, unionize one by one, leading to an inevitable tipping point. The template for this sort of thing was set in the animation world last February when production workers for Adult Swim’s <em>Rick &amp; Morty</em> and Hulu’s <em>Solar Opposites </em><a href="https://www.cartoonbrew.com/artist-rights/production-workers-on-rick-and-morty-and-solar-opposites-file-to-unionize-213740.html">filed a petition</a> with the NLRB for a union election, sparking a new wave of unionization for workers throughout the animation industry by becoming the first to be represented by the IATSE-affiliated Animation Guild. Soon after, workers at the Los Angeles branch of the award-winning production house <a href="https://titmouse.net/">Titmouse</a> joined the guild to begin collective bargaining for their first union contract. And those efforts ultimately compelled a coalition of production workers on the shows <em>American Dad</em>, <em>Family Guy,</em> and <em>The Simpsons</em> <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/07/the-simpsons-family-guy-american-dad-workers-repped-by-animation-guild-1235058303/">to also unionize</a> under the Animation Guild, teeing up new collective-bargaining negotiations for increased benefits with 20th Television Animation last summer.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll0zp41r000p3b6x2o37ogua@published" data-word-count="78">“We are witnessing an unprecedented wave of solidarity that’s breaking down old barriers in the industry and proving we’re all in this fight together,” said IATSE International president Matthew D. Loeb. “That doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Entertainment workers everywhere are sticking up for each other’s rights; that’s what our movement is all about. I congratulate these workers on taking this important step and using their collective voice. I urge Marvel Studios to voluntarily recognize their union immediately.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/raku-a-language-for-gremlins/">https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/raku-a-language-for-gremlins/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37040681">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                

                
                    
                        <p>I just added a big new section to learntla: <a href="https://learntla.com/topics/optimization.html" target="_blank">Optimizing TLA+ Model Checking</a>. I take a spec and then show 15 different optimizations, many of them getting a 10x runtime improvement. Patreon notes <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/notes-on-tla-87093195" target="_blank">here</a>. Besides that I've done very little writing the last couple weeks. I'm just in a slump: I sit down to write and the words all come out wrong. It happens sometimes and there's nothing to do about it but wait it out. </p>
<p>So instead of working I've been learning <a href="https://raku.org/" target="_blank">Raku</a>.<sup id="fnref:perl6"><a href="#fn:perl6">1</a></sup> It originally got on my radar after I ranted about <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/i-am-disappointed-by-dynamic-typing/" target="_blank">dynamic languages</a> and a couple of users told me I'd like Raku. I finally checked it out last week to see if it'd make a good "calculator language". I use a hodgepodge of Python, <a href="https://hillelwayne.com/post/j-notation/" target="_blank">J</a>, <a href="https://hillelwayne.com/post/frink/" target="_blank">Frink</a>, and Excel to do math and they all have their own big drawbacks, so it'd be nice if Raku could round them out.</p>
<p>After several days of experiments, I'm at a loss of <em>how</em> to describe Raku. The best I can come up with is that the language was designed by a bunch of really intelligent gremlins. Gremlins who spent a lot of time gathering feedback from other gremlins. </p>
<h3>Weird Operators</h3>
<p>Raku has no qualms about using Unicode operators. You check set membership with ∈. There's also ∉, ∋, and ∌. It's also fine with alphanumeric infix operators. String repetition op is <code>x</code>. Function composition is <code>o</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>"a"</span> <span>x</span> <span>3</span>
<span>aaa</span>
&gt; <span>my</span> <span>&amp;f</span> = <span>&amp;sqrt</span> <span>o</span> <span>&amp;abs</span>
{<span>noise</span>}
&gt; <span>f</span> -<span>3</span>
<span>1.7320508075688772</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>X</code> gives you the cross product of a list, <code>Xf</code> applies <code>f</code> to each element of the cross product, <code>Zf</code> does the same with zip.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>&lt;a b c&gt;</span> <span>X</span> <span>&lt;1 2 3&gt;</span>
((<span>a</span> <span>1</span>) (<span>a</span> <span>2</span>) (<span>a</span> <span>3</span>) (<span>b</span> <span>1</span>) (<span>b</span> <span>2</span>) (<span>b</span> <span>3</span>) (<span>c</span> <span>1</span>) (<span>c</span> <span>2</span>) (<span>c</span> <span>3</span>))
&gt; <span>&lt;a b c&gt;</span> <span>Xx</span> <span>&lt;1 2 3&gt;</span>
(<span>a</span> <span>aa</span> <span>aaa</span> <span>b</span> <span>bb</span> <span>bbb</span> <span>c</span> <span>cc</span> <span>ccc</span>)
&gt; <span>&lt;a b c&gt;</span> <span>Zx</span> <span>&lt;1 2 3&gt;</span>
(<span>a</span> <span>bb</span> <span>ccc</span>)
</code></pre></div>

<p>If <code>f</code> is an infix operator, then <code>[f]</code> reduces a list and <code>[\f]</code> accumulates it: </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; [+] <span>&lt;1 2 3 4 5&gt;</span>
<span>15</span>
&gt; [\+] <span>&lt;1 2 3 4 5&gt;</span>
(<span>1</span> <span>3</span> <span>6</span> <span>10</span> <span>15</span>)
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>~~</code> is the "anything goes" matcher.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>"abc"</span> ~~ <span>"abc"</span> <span># do the strings match?</span>
<span>True</span>
&gt; <span>"abc"</span> ~~ <span>Str</span> <span># is abc a string?</span>
<span>True</span>
&gt; <span>"abc"</span> ~~ {.<span>chars</span> == <span>3</span>} <span># is abc length 3?</span>
<span>True</span>
&gt; <span>so</span> <span>"abc"</span> ~~<span> /^b/</span> <span>#does abc start with b?</span>
<span>False</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Finally, there's <code>...</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>&gt; <span>0</span>,<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>..<span>.10</span>
(<span>0</span> <span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>3</span> <span>4</span> <span>5</span> <span>6</span> <span>7</span> <span>8</span> <span>9</span> <span>10</span>)

&gt; <span>0</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>4</span>..<span>.10</span>
(<span>0</span> <span>2</span> <span>4</span> <span>6</span> <span>8</span> <span>10</span>)

&gt; <span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>4</span>..<span>.10</span>
(<span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>4</span> <span>8</span>)
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Defining operators</h3>
<p>So you know how some languages let you define infix operators? Raku lets you also define new circumfix and <em>postcircumfix</em> operators.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span># circumfix</span>
<span>sub</span> <span>circumfix:</span><span>&lt;[∀ zz&gt;</span>(<span>$inner</span>){<span>sum</span>(<span>$inner</span>)}
&gt; [∀ <span>1</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>5</span>..<span>.10</span> <span>zz</span>
<span>25</span>

<span># vector inner product!</span>
<span>sub</span> <span>postcircumfix:</span><span>&lt;| ⟩&gt;</span>(<span>@left</span>, <span>@inside</span>){[+] (<span>@left</span> <span>Z</span>* <span>@inside</span>)}
&gt; <span>&lt;1 2 3&gt;</span>|<span>&lt;4 5 6&gt;</span>⟩
<span>32</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In addition to left- and right-associative infix operators, you can define operators to be chain associative (like how <code>x &lt; y &lt; z</code> is <code>x &lt; y &amp;&amp; y &lt; z</code>) and "list" associative (<code>a op b op c</code> is <code>op(a, b, c)</code>).</p>
<h3>Multiple dispatch</h3>
<p>So Raku has "multiple dispatch", meaning that you overload a function with multiple different type signatures and it will choose the appropriate one. </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span># @ is for iterable types</span>

<span>multi</span> <span>f</span>(<span>$x</span>,<span>@arr</span>) {<span>@arr</span>.<span>map</span>(-&gt; <span>$elem</span> {<span>$elem</span> + <span>$x</span>})}
<span>multi</span> <span>f</span>(<span>@arr</span>, <span>$x</span>) {<span>@arr</span>.<span>map</span>(-&gt; <span>$elem</span> {<span>$elem</span> + <span>$x</span>})}
<span>multi</span> <span>f</span>(<span>@arr1</span>, <span>@arr2</span>) {<span>@arr1</span> <span>Z</span>+ <span>@arr2</span>}

&gt; <span>f</span>(<span>2</span>, <span>&lt;1 2 3&gt;</span>);
(<span>3</span> <span>4</span> <span>5</span>)

&gt; <span>f</span>(<span>&lt;1 2 3&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;3 4 5&gt;</span>)
(<span>4</span> <span>6</span> <span>8</span>)
</code></pre></div>

<p>This isn't weird, lots of languages have multiple dispatch. What <em>is</em> weird is that you can also dispatch based on a <em>runtime predicate of the value</em>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>multi</span> <span>my_abs</span>(<span>Int</span> <span>$x</span> <span>where</span> {<span>$x</span> &gt; <span>0</span>}) {<span>$x</span>}
<span>multi</span> <span>my_abs</span>(<span>Int</span> <span>$x</span>) {-<span>$x</span>}

&gt; <span>map</span> <span>&amp;my_abs</span>, <span>&lt;-4 4&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Also the signature of a function is a first-class value, as are the parameters in the signature.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Things</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you define a <code>MAIN</code> function, any parameters you give it will be automatically turned into CLI flags.</li>
<li>Objects have way more preloaded methods than I've seen in any language, and I used to do Rails. The <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/List" target="_blank">List object</a> has methods for getting all permutations, all k-combinations, and all sliding windows.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Junction" target="_blank">Junctions</a> are this weird type-value-thing for doing multiple comparisons at once. <code>1|2</code> expands to <code>any(1, 2)</code>, so <code>1 &lt; 1|2</code>. <code>1&amp;2</code> expands to <code>all(1, 2)</code>, so <code>1 !&lt; 1&amp;2</code>.<ul>
<li>Oh yeah and you can negate any infix operator by prefixing it with <code>!</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Raku is the only language I've ever seen that has <code>$kebab-case</code> names <em>and</em> infix subtraction, I'm guessing because sigils disambiguate <code>x-y</code>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes" target="_blank">regex syntax</a> isn't backwards compatible with Perl 5. For <em>thirty years</em> languages followed the PCRE "standard" and Perl 6 just…  threw it all away.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>That's just a tiny slice of all the weird Raku features, since I've only been looking at calculator applications so far. I haven't even learned about the object system, packages, or <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/grammar_tutorial" target="_blank">grammars</a>! And even so, I <em>still</em> left out a ton of stuff. Like in a function body, <code>samewith</code> will call the same function with new arguments.</p>
<p>I think if I had to maintain a Raku legacy codebase my brain would explode. I have no idea how people would manage to write this language In The Large. At the same time, it seems incredible for programming In The Small. One-off scripts, computations, personal tooling, all the kinds of things I wanted to do with it in the first place.</p>
<p>I've also seen some really frustrating things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The documentation is really poor and the heavy reliance on symbols makes it hard to search for things. I've learned a lot of poorly-documented languages but Raku is much bigger and more complex than any of them and it can be real demotivating.</li>
<li>The REPL crashes on Windows if I type in any Unicode. The compiler is also pretty slow, with even small files taking half a second or more. Iterating on things is painful.</li>
<li>I hate the sigil thing. I spent half an hour debugging a problem because I wrote <code>$x</code> instead of <code>@x</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall? Maybe I'm just a gremlin at heart, but I think I like this language and want it to succeed. I assume I'll have a more balanced picture thoughts after I use it in anger. I just hope that over time the compile times and documentation improve.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article> <div id="readme"><h2>Doculite</h2>
<p>DocuLite lets you use SQLite like Firebase Firestore. It's written in Typescript and an adapter on top of sqlite3 and sqlite. It support listeners on documents, collections, and basic queries. Feedback &amp; Bugs to <a href="mailto:thedoculite@gmail.com">thedoculite@gmail.com</a>.
This is early work, so please treat it appropriately.</p>
<h2>Current features</h2>
<h2>1. Initialize a DB</h2>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>import { Database } from "doculite"
const db = new Database();
</code></pre>
<h2>2. Create Collections and Set Documents</h2>
<p>Collections are created on first insertion of a document. They are represented by a SQLite Table.</p>
<pre><code>// create ref to the doc. Doc ID optional.

const usersRef = db.collection("users").doc("123");
const refWithoutId = db.collection("users").doc();

// Any valid Javascript object that can be parsed to valid JSON can be inserted as a document.

await usersRef.set({ username: "John Doe", createdAt: "123", updatedAt: "123" });
await refWithoutId.set({ username: "Jane Doe" });

</code></pre>
<h2>3. Get a particular document</h2>
<pre><code>// define ref
const usersRef = db.collection("users").doc("123");
// get
const user = await usersRef.get();
// print
console.log(user); // prints { username: "John Doe" };

</code></pre>
<h2>4. Update Documents in Collections</h2>
<pre><code>// ref
const usersRef = db.collection("users").doc("123");

// Properties existing on both old and new object will be updated.
// Properties only existing on the new object will be added.

// If merge is false, properties only present on the old object will be deleted.
// Merge is true by default

await ref.set({ username: "DERP Doe", updatedAt: "345" }, { merge: true });
// document in DB is now { username: "DERP Doe", updatedAt: "345", createdAt: "123" }

await ref.set({ username: "DERP Doe", updatedAt: "345" }, { merge: false });
// document in DB is now { username: "DERP Doe", updatedAt: "345" }

</code></pre>
<h2>5. Delete Documents in Collection</h2>
<pre><code>const db = new Database();

const ref = db.collection("users").doc("deletable");

await ref.set({ username: "deletableUsername", updatedAt: 123123 });

await ref.delete();

const doc = await ref.get();

console.log(doc) // prints null

</code></pre>
<h2>6. Listen to real-time updates of documents.</h2>
<pre><code>
// ref to doc
const ref = db.collection("users").doc("123");

// snapshot listener returns unsubscribe function
const unsub = ref.onSnapshot((doc) =&gt; {
console.log("Omg the user doc is updating!", doc?.username);
});

await ref.set({ username: "SHEESH Doe", updatedAt: 2 });
// prints: `Omg the user doc is updating! SHEESH Doe`

// unsub
unsub();

</code></pre>
<h2>7. Query Documents in a collection by equality comparison</h2>
<pre><code>
const usersRef = db.collection("users");

await usersRef.doc().set({ username: "Doculite", updatedAt: 234 });

const query = usersRef.where("username", "Doculite");

const docs = await query.get();

const user = docs[0]

console.log(user.username) // prints `Doculite`

</code></pre>
<h2>Potential roadmap:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Better query-based system</li>
<li>Stability and speed updates</li>
<li>Delete collections</li>
<li>Subcollections</li>
<li>Listeners on queries / multiple documents</li>
<li>Queries with other comparison operators (&lt;, &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, contains, etc.)</li>
<li>Queries for multiple variables (without indexes, probably)</li>
<li>Queries with Full Text Search (without indexes, probably)</li>
</ol>

    </div>
<p>Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries power smartphones, electric vehicles and storage for solar and wind energy, among other technologies.

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>They descend from another technology, the lithium-metal battery, that hasn't been developed or adopted as broadly. There's a reason for that: While lithium-metal batteries have the potential to hold about double the energy that lithium-ion batteries can, they also present a far greater risk of catching fire or even exploding.
</p><p>Now, a study by members of the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA reveals a fundamental discovery that could lead to safer lithium-metal batteries that outperform today's lithium-ion batteries. The research was published today in the journal <i>Nature</i>.
</p><p>Metallic lithium reacts so easily with chemicals that, under normal conditions, corrosion forms almost immediately while the metal is being laid down on a surface such as an electrode. But the UCLA investigators developed a technique that prevents that corrosion and showed that, in its absence, lithium atoms assemble into a surprising shape—the rhombic dodecahedron, a 12-sided figure similar to the dice used in role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons.
</p><p>"There are thousands of papers on lithium metal, and most descriptions of the structure is qualitative, such as 'chunky' or 'column-like,'" said Yuzhang Li, the study's corresponding author, an assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering and a member of CNSI.
</p><p>"It was surprising for us to discover that when we prevented surface corrosion, instead of these ill-defined shapes, we saw a singular polyhedron that matches theoretical predictions based on the metal's crystal structure. Ultimately, this study allows us to revise how we understand lithium-metal batteries."
</p><p>At tiny scales, a lithium-ion battery stores positively charged lithium atoms in a cage-like structure of carbon that coats an electrode. By contrast, a lithium-metal battery instead coats the electrode with metallic lithium. That packs 10 times more lithium into the same space compared to <a href="https://phys.org/tags/lithium-ion+batteries/" rel="tag">lithium-ion batteries</a>, which accounts for the increase in both performance and danger.
</p><p>The process for laying down the lithium coating is based on a 200-plus-year-old technique that employs electricity and solutions of salts called electrolytes. Often, the lithium forms microscopic branching filaments with protruding spikes. In a battery, if two of those spikes crisscross, it can cause a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/short+circuit/" rel="tag">short circuit</a> that could lead to an explosion.


											  													    </p>
											  
											  <p>The revelation of the true shape of lithium—that is, in the absence of corrosion—suggests that the explosion risk for lithium-metal batteries can be abated, because the atoms accumulate in an orderly form instead of one that can crisscross. The discovery could also have substantial implications for high-performance energy technology.
</p><p>"Scientists and engineers have produced over two decades' worth of research into synthesizing metals including gold, platinum and silver into shapes such as nanocubes, nanospheres and nanorods," Li said. "Now that we know the shape of lithium, the question is, Can we tune it so that it forms cubes, which can be packed in densely to increase both the safety and performance of batteries?"

    </div>

<p>Until now, the prevailing view had been that the choice of electrolytes in solution determines the shape that lithium forms on a surface—whether the structure resembles chunks or columns. The UCLA researchers had a different idea.
</p><p>"We wanted to see if we could deposit lithium so quickly that we outpace the reaction that causes the corrosion film," said UCLA doctoral student Xintong Yuan, the study's first author. "That way, we could potentially see how the lithium wants to grow in the absence of that film."
</p><p>The researchers developed a new technique for depositing lithium faster than corrosion forms. They ran current through a much smaller electrode in order to push electricity out faster—much like the way that partially blocking the nozzle of a garden hose causes water to shoot out more forcefully.
</p><p>A balance was required, however, because speeding up the process too much would lead to the same spiky structures that cause short circuits; the team addressed that issue by adjusting the shape of their tiny electrode.
</p><p>They laid down lithium on surfaces using four different electrolytes, comparing results between a standard technique and their new method. With corrosion, the lithium formed four distinct microscopic shapes. However, with their corrosion-free process, they found that the lithium formed miniscule dodecahedrons—no bigger than 2 millionths of a meter, or about the average length of a single bacterium—in all four cases.
</p><p>The researchers were able to see the shape of lithium thanks to an imaging technique called <a href="https://phys.org/tags/cryo-electron+microscopy/" rel="tag">cryo-electron microscopy</a>, or cryo-EM, which beams electrons through frozen samples in order to show details down to the atomic level while inhibiting damage to the samples.
</p><p>Cryo-EM has become ubiquitous in biosciences for determining the structures of proteins and viruses. Use for <a href="https://phys.org/tags/materials+science/" rel="tag">materials science</a> is growing, and the UCLA researchers had two key advantages.
</p><p>First, when Li was a graduate student, he demonstrated that cryo-EM can be used to analyze lithium, which falls to pieces when exposed to an electron beam at room temperature. Second, the team performed experiments at CNSI's Electron Imaging Center for Nanomachines, which is home to several cryo-EM instruments that have been customized to accommodate the types of samples used in materials research.
</p><p>"Cross-pollination between the biology and chemistry communities is producing new ideas," said Matthew Mecklenburg, a co-author of the study and managing director of the imaging center. "We're applying our extensive experience analyzing small molecules, proteins and viruses using cryo-EM methods in new ways to look at battery materials that are sensitive to the electron beam."
</p><p>Li said the new technique for depositing <a href="https://phys.org/tags/lithium/" rel="tag">lithium</a> still requires further work to optimize it.

These sections establish Zoom's rights to compile and utilize "Service Generated Data," which is any telemetry data, product usage data, diagnostic data, and similar content or data that Zoom collects in connection with users' use of their services or software.</p>



<p>Zoom's updated policy states that all rights to Service Generated Data are retained solely by Zoom. This extends to Zoom's rights to modify, distribute, process, share, maintain, and store such data "for any purpose, to the extent and in the manner permitted under applicable law."</p>



<p>What raises alarm is the explicit mention of the company's right to use this data for machine learning and artificial intelligence, including training and tuning of algorithms and models. This effectively allows Zoom to train its AI on customer content without providing an opt-out option, a decision that is likely to spark significant debate about user privacy and consent.</p>



<p>Additionally, under section 10.4 of the updated terms, Zoom has secured a "perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license" to redistribute, publish, access, use, store, transmit, review, disclose, preserve, extract, modify, reproduce, share, use, display, copy, distribute, translate, transcribe, create derivative works, and process Customer Content.</p>



<p>Zoom justifies these actions as necessary for providing services to customers, supporting the services, and improving its services, software, or other products. However, the implications of such terms are far-reaching, particularly as they appear to permit Zoom to use customer data for any purpose relating to the uses or acts described in section 10.3.</p>



<p>Privacy advocates and legal experts are expected to scrutinize these updated terms closely. Many argue that they push the boundaries of what is acceptable in terms of consent, data privacy, and individual rights. While Zoom's intentions may be focused on improving their platform and delivering better service, the breadth and depth of these changes may leave many users uncomfortable and seeking assurances about how their data is being used.</p>



<p>Zoom has yet to comment (added below) on the updates and potential concerns raised by these changes. As this unfolds, the debate around privacy in the digital age and the responsibility of companies in respecting user privacy continues to intensify.</p>

<h3>An update</h3>



<p>Biella Coleman picked this story up and <a href="https://twitter.com/BiellaColeman/status/1688332659108257792" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted it out</a>, which got this trending and invoked a response from Zoom. </p>



<p>Aparna Bawa, COO at Zoom, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37029700" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left a comment on Hacker News</a>,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To clarify, Zoom customers decide whether to enable generative AI features (recently launched on a free trial basis) and separately whether to share customer content with Zoom for product improvement purposes.</p>



<p>Also, Zoom participants receive an in-meeting notice or a Chat Compose pop-up when these features are enabled through our UI, and they will definitely know their data may be used for product improvement purposes.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I myself also got an email from a spokesperson, who said that, <em>"Zoom customers decide whether to enable generative AI features, and separately whether to share customer content with Zoom for product improvement purposes."</em>.</p>



<p>While these are all lovely responses, and at least they're being involved in the discussion, they don't actually answer the <strong>10.4</strong> clause in the Terms of Service, which states,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You agree to grant and hereby grant Zoom a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license and all other rights required or necessary to redistribute, publish, import, access, use, store, transmit, review, disclose, preserve, extract, modify, reproduce, share, use, display, copy, distribute, translate, transcribe, create derivative works, and process Customer Content and to perform all acts with respect to the Customer Content, including AI and ML training and testing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Unless these are rectified and clarified, this means that Zoom can do exactly what they say they can do because you are agreeing to grant all the abovementioned permissions. I cannot stress enough that these aren't just "words at a wall" - in the <strong>10.2</strong> clause, you literally consent to Zoom using your data for AI/ML; you do not have a choice to opt-out because opting-out is not part of the terms.</p>



<p>Zoom has published a blog post on the matter; <a href="https://twitter.com/Zoom/status/1688550493717417985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can see the tweet here</a>. </p>



<p>I'm linking to the tweet (and you can also read <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37034980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this Hacker News comment</a>) because there should be discourse (unfortunately, for Zoom, it's not in their favor) around this rather than blank statements.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p>Git is a widely used distributed version control system that allows software development teams to have multiple local copies of the project's source code that are independent of each other. Version control has come to be associated with Git—it is unquestionably the best version control program for new developers to start learning due to its popularity and wealth of resources related to its use. Read on for an overview of the basics.</p>

<h2>Git configuration: Linux</h2>

<p>Most Linux installations have Git, but to check, execute the following command in your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>$ git --version</code></pre>

<p>You should get output that is similar to the following:</p>

<pre>git version 2.40.1</pre>

<h2>Git configuration: Windows</h2>

<p>Git searches the <code>$HOME</code> directory for the <code>.gitconfig</code> file on Windows systems.</p>

<p>We need to tell Git to keep track of our login and email when we use it, as shown in the code snippet below. This makes it possible for other code contributors to identify the change's author and our contact information in case of problems.</p>

<pre><code>$ git config --global user.name "username"

$ git config --global user.email "useremail"</code></pre>

<p>Use the following command if you need assistance:</p>

<pre><code>$ git help config</code></pre>

<p>This command will open a browser containing configuration commands. Essentially, the <code>help</code> command gives a manual from the help page for the given command.</p>

<p>You can also use the same command in the following ways:</p>

<pre><code>$ git config --help</code></pre>

<p>Use the following command to view configurations:</p>

<pre><code>$ git config -l</code></pre>

<h2>Working with repositories</h2>

<p>A directory that Git will track is called a <strong>repository</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>or repo. The Git repository contains the whole of our project. Git will trace any change we make. We'll use the command below to create a test directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir test</code></pre>

<p>We can then use the following command to enter the test directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd test</code></pre>

<p>Running <code>git init</code> command inside the directory lets Git know that it is a Git repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ git init&nbsp;

Empty Git repository created and initialised in /home/uname/test/.git</code></pre>

<p>Now a Git repository exists in this directory. Showing the <code>.git</code> file that Git generated inside the directory will be helpful; use the command as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -a</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<pre>.git</pre>

<p>The directory is now a Git repository. In fact, deleting the <code>.git</code> directory will uninitialize the repository (this can be very helpful when you're just starting out). Run the following command to make your directory a non-Git repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ rm.git -rf</code></pre>

<p>Use this only if you truly want to start over because it will remove Git from the directory completely.</p>

<p>Let's create two files in the test directory with the names <code>file1</code> and <code>file2</code>. This will show how Git tracks files:</p>

<pre><code>$ touch file1.txt
$ touch file2.txt</code></pre>

<h2>Staging files: git add&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The principles of the staging environment and the commit are essential to Git. You can add, change, or remove files as you work. However, anytime you reach an important stage or complete a portion of the work, you should move the files to a staging environment. Files that have been <strong>staged</strong> are ready to be committed to the repository you are working on. (We'll discuss commits in more detail in a later section.)</p>

<p>We can see what Git is tracking using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git status

On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:

&nbsp;&nbsp;(use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;file1.txt
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; File2.txt</code></pre>

<p><code>git status</code> displays a list of newly added or modified files and directories in the Git repository. In our example,&nbsp;<code>file1.txt</code> and <code>file2.txt</code> have been modified.</p>

<p>We must stage the files in order to instruct Git to keep track of changes. Let's use the <code>add</code> command to stage <code>file1.txt</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git add file1.txt

$ git status
On branch master
No commits yet
Changes to be committed:
&nbsp; &nbsp;(use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; new file: file1.txt
Untracked files:
&nbsp; (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; file2.txt</code></pre>

<p>Notice that <code>file1.txt</code> is listed under <strong>Changes to be committed</strong> by Git. This indicates that Git is keeping note of any modifications made to this file in order to commit those modifications to the repository. Let's add <code>file2.txt</code> now:</p>

<pre><code>$ git add file2.txt


$ git status
...
Changes to be committed:
&nbsp; (use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; new file: file1.txt
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; new file: file2.txt</code></pre>

<p>You can instruct Git to monitor a file or directory using the <code>add</code> command or to stop tracking a file or directory with the <code>unstaging</code> command.</p>

<p>The git <code>rm</code> command is used to remove individual files or a set of files using the filename, as shown below. The <code>git rm --cached</code> command maintains a file in the working directory while removing it from the Git index.&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code>$ git rm --cached file1.txt
rm file1.txt

$ git status
…
Untracked files: (
&nbsp; use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; file1.txt
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>file1.txt</code> file is no longer being tracked.</p>

<h2>Keeping track of untracked files</h2>

<p>We frequently need a quick way to tell Git to add everything that is untracked to the staging area. We can do this by using <code>*</code> or <code>.</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git add --all</code></pre>

<pre><code>$ git add .</code></pre>

<pre><code>$ git add *</code></pre>

<p>Stage all changes (new, changed, and deleted) files by using <code>--all</code> rather than specific filenames.</p>

<h2>Commits</h2>

<p>Git uses <strong>commits</strong> to make changes to files and directories permanent. In a sense, every commit represents a new version of our repository. Even while a commit can be seen to be a more permanent change, Git makes it simple to undo those changes, which is the strength of version control with Git.</p>

<p>For Git users, this alters the fundamental development model. Git developers have the option to build up commits in their local repo before making a change and committing it to the main repository. It accomplishes this by tracking the history of commits. Git's main purpose is to allow users to make commits. Everything we wanted to stage has already been done, so we can now make those modifications.&nbsp;<code>git commit</code> is used to do this.</p>

<p>When using the <code>git commit</code> command, we recommend always including two arguments: <code>-a</code> and <code>-m</code>.</p>

<h3>Stage all modified files: git commit -a</h3>

<p>Add all untracked files to the staging area with the <code>-a</code> or <code>--all</code>&nbsp;option. Note that only previously added files and folders are added using this method. Use the <code>add</code> command first if a file or directory has to be added that hasn't already been.</p>

<h3>Commit messages: git commit -m</h3>

<p>A commit message should always be included when making a commit. The <code>-m</code> or <code>--message</code> option is used for this. This message should be brief and descriptive, with just enough information included in the commit statement to summarize your actions since the last commit.</p>

<pre><code>$ git commit -am "my first git commit"</code></pre>

<h3>View change history: git log</h3>

<p>To view the history of changes that have been committed to a Git repository, use the <code>git log</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log</code></pre>

<p>In order to make our output easier to read and only to show the first seven characters of the commit ID, we'll also use the option <code>--oneline</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log -oneline</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<pre>cf0p490 (HEAD -&gt; main) my first git commit</pre>

<p>In this example, the commit ID's first seven characters are <code>cf0p490</code>. There will be a lot of commits; thus each one needs to have its own identification. We can move the <code>HEAD</code> pointer around as necessary.</p>

<h2>Publishing changes: git push</h2>

<p>Finally, the <code>git push</code> command is used to upload content from a local repository to a remote repository. <strong>Pushing</strong> refers to the process of transferring commits from your local repository to a remote repository.</p>

<pre><code>$ git push</code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin branchname</code></pre>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div b-gj8cwnhyng=""><p>Where C# is the most dominant language in the .NET world, other languages are built on top of the Framework that deserves their respective place. F# is strong when it comes down to functional programming! In this blog post, we will leverage the power of F# and C# to showcase where both excel!</p>
<h2 id="why-does-it-work">Why does it work?</h2>
<p>Before I go into the details of the code, I want to explain why this works. Why can we use F# code in C# and vice versa? The answer is simple: the .NET Framework is a runtime that can execute code written in different languages. The runtime is responsible for compiling the code to an intermediate language (IL) that the runtime can execute. If your code is dependent on other libraries, you are not relying on the source code but the IL code of that library. I already had a whole blog post about that: <a href="https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/aa23a1c9-8ab2-4b05-9bd2-52624af7b684">"<em>What is the difference between C#, .NET, IL and JIT?</em>"</a>. Have a read here if you are interested in more details.</p>
<p><img src="https://linkdotnetblog.azureedge.net/blog/20220612_CSharpDotNetJit/Dotnet.webp" alt=".NET"></p>
<h2 id="f">F#</h2>
<p>Here is a very brief introduction: F# is a functional-first programming language in the .NET ecosystem. It is designed to provide the expressive power of functional programming alongside the robustness of object-oriented paradigms. It enjoys all of the benefits of the .NET Framework itself: open-source, platform-independent, and strongly typed.</p>
<pre><code>let rec factorial n =
    if n = 0 then 1 else n * factorial (n - 1)

printfn "Factorial of 5 is %d" (factorial 5)
</code></pre>
<p>F# also has some distinct features C# does not offer, the most prominent: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/discriminated-unions">Discriminated unions</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-use-case">The use case</h2>
<p>I want to showcase where F# excels - and oftentimes, that can be the domain layer of your application. Especially then when you have a lot of calculations (basically where functional programming excels in the first place). Let's create a small domain project that is written in F# and see how it could look like in C#. I will create a "small online" shop that can take orders and calculate a discount (a percentage or a fixed amount). Before we go into F#, have a look at the C# code:</p>
<pre><code>
public class Product 
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}

public class OrderLine 
{
    public Product Product { get; set; }
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
}

public enum DiscountType { Percentage, FixedAmount }

public class Discount 
{
    public DiscountType Type { get; set; }
    public decimal Value { get; set; }
}

public record Order(List&lt;OrderLine&gt; OrderLines, Discount Discount)
{
    public decimal CalculateTotalPrice() 
    {
        decimal subtotal = OrderLines.Sum(ol =&gt; ol.Product.Price * ol.Quantity);
        decimal totalDiscount = 0M;

        if (Discount != null) {
            totalDiscount = Discount.Type == DiscountType.Percentage 
                                ? subtotal * Discount.Value / 100M 
                                : Discount.Value;
        }

        return subtotal - totalDiscount;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now for the sake of simplicity, I left out a lot of validation and error handling. I hope you get the idea anyway. Now let's see how this would look like in F#:</p>
<pre><code>type Product = { Name: string; Price: decimal }
type OrderLine = { Product: Product; Quantity: int }

type Discount = 
    | Percentage of float
    | FixedAmount of decimal

type Order(orderLines: OrderLine list, discount: Discount option) =
    member this.CalculateTotalPrice() =
        let subtotal = List.sumBy (fun ol -&gt; ol.Product.Price * (decimal ol.Quantity)) orderLines
        let totalDiscount =
            discount
            |&gt; Option.map (fun d -&gt; 
                match d with
                | Percentage p -&gt; subtotal * (decimal p / 100M)
                | FixedAmount f -&gt; f)
            |&gt; Option.defaultValue 0M
        subtotal - totalDiscount
</code></pre>
<p>Wow - that is really slim. Let's go through the code step by step. First, we have the <code>Product</code> and <code>OrderLine</code> types. They are just simple records that hold the data. Then we have the <code>Discount</code> type. This is a discriminated union that can either be a <code>Percentage</code> or a <code>FixedAmount</code>. The <code>Order</code> type class takes a list of <code>OrderLine</code> and an optional <code>Discount</code>. The <code>CalculateTotalPrice</code> method is the same as in the C# example. The only difference is that we use the <code>Option</code> type to handle the <code>null</code> case. The <code>Option</code> type is a discriminated union that can either be <code>Some</code> or <code>None</code>. We can use pattern matching to handle both cases. In this case we use the <code>Option.map</code> function to map the <code>Discount</code> to a <code>decimal</code> value. If the <code>Discount</code> is <code>None</code> we use the <code>Option.defaultValue</code> function to return <code>0M</code>.</p>
<p>Now we can easily integrate that to a controller:</p>
<pre><code>[ApiController]
[Route("api/orders")]
public class OrderController : ControllerBase
{
    private static readonly List&lt;Order&gt; Orders = new();

    [HttpPost]
    public ActionResult&lt;Order&gt; CreateOrder([FromBody] List&lt;OrderLine&gt; orderLines, [FromBody] Discount discount)
    {
        var fsharpOrderLines = ListModule.OfSeq(orderLines);
        var order = new Order(fsharpOrderLines, discount);
        Orders.Add(order);
        return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetOrderById), new { id = Orders.Count - 1 }, order);
    }

    [HttpGet("{id:int}")]
    public ActionResult&lt;Order&gt; GetOrderById(int id)
    {
        if (id &lt; 0 || id &gt;= Orders.Count)
        {
            return NotFound();
        }

        return Orders[id];
    }

    [HttpGet("{id:int}/total")]
    public ActionResult&lt;decimal&gt; GetOrderTotalPrice(int id)
    {
        if (id &lt; 0 || id &gt;= Orders.Count)
        {
            return NotFound();
        }

        return Orders[id].CalculateTotalPrice();
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public ActionResult&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Order&gt;&gt; GetAllOrders()
    {
        return Orders;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>There might be a very special line here that needs some clarification:</p>
<pre><code>var fsharpOrderLines = ListModule.OfSeq(orderLines);
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>ListModule.OfSeq</code> function is a helper function that converts a <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> to a <code>seq&lt;T&gt;</code>. The <code>seq&lt;T&gt;</code> type is a sequence of elements. It is a lazy collection that is only evaluated when needed. This is a very powerful concept that is used a lot in F#. You can read more about it <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/sequences">here</a>. In this case we need to convert the <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> to a <code>seq&lt;T&gt;</code> because the <code>Order</code> type expects a <code>seq&lt;T&gt;</code> as input.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this blog post gave you a good overview of how you can use F# and C# together. It can be a very powerful tool, and F# has some unique strengths that can make your life easier!</p>

Many parts in (western made) Russian passenger aircraft that would normally be easily replaced are rapidly wearing out with no replacement parts in sight due to the import of spare aircraft parts from Boeing and Airbus being banned since March 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to the aforementioned sanctions, Russian flag carrier Aeroflot is experiencing problems replacing worn-out brakes on "foreign" (non-Russian-made) aircraft.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.aeroxplorer.com/large/TEB-PMqbC8cGnKGcbaCJVqhy.jpg"><figcaption>Photo: A T | AeroXplorer</figcaption></figure><p><br>Due to Aeroflot's inability to replace worn-out brakes on its fleet, the airline has requested that its pilots turn off the brakes on affected aircraft. Currently, nine Aeroflot planes are flying with turned brakes: five Boeing 777-300ERs, one Airbus A330-300, one Airbus A320, and two Airbus A321s.&nbsp;</p><p>An aircraft can land without brakes, as during landing most of the work of stopping a commercial aircraft is done through the use of thrust reversers. However, landing without the aid of brakes will significantly increase the amount of runway an aircraft uses on landing. Brakes are also necessary for aborting takeoffs, through the use of Auto Brakes, which automatically activate should pilots decide to abort a takeoff for whatever reason.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the airline requesting pilots turn off brakes on affected aircraft, mechanics and technicians in Aeroflot's flight operations department are actively warning pilots of the increased risk of runway overruns. When pilots land an affected Aeroflot aircraft (without brakes), "...The aircraft will tend to turn to the side...especially when landing on a wet runway with a side [side] wind..."&nbsp;</p><p>According to The Moscow Times, Russian Airlines are allowed to refuse the repair of aircraft brakes for up to 10 days, after which they must either be replaced or turned off, with a notification of the Federal Agency for Air Transport (FATA) required.&nbsp;</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.aeroxplorer.com/large/TEB-OkB9TGwo6uOx0i6j4tjr.jpg"><figcaption>Photo: AeroXplorer | Lukasz S.</figcaption></figure><br>&nbsp;<h2>Russian aviation is becoming progressively more dangerous.&nbsp;</h2><p>As of August 2022, there does not appear to be any end in sight to the seemingly endless Russia-Ukraine conflict and subsequent sanctions. Due to the scarce supply of aircraft parts, many Russian airlines, including Aeroflot, are cannibalizing their own aircraft for parts. Demand within the Russian passenger aviation industry is growing, and most of Russia's civilian aircraft fleet is comprised of foreign aircraft.&nbsp;</p><p>While Russia is attempting to increase its domestic aircraft production with aerospace companies by the likes of Irkut (Yakovlev), and Tupolev, this will happen gradually. So for now, the Russian aviation industry will remain in a dangerous position in which the risk of crashes will remain at a drastically high level, primarily due to sanctions.&nbsp;</p><h2>Aeroflot - One Of The Oldest Airlines In The World.&nbsp;</h2><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.aeroxplorer.com/large/XhqQl3aaA8ovFX8mfO2Z.jpg"><figcaption>Photo: AeroXplorer | Cody Newton</figcaption></figure><p>Founded in 1923, 100-year-old Aeroflot has a fleet of 172 aircraft, most all composed of Airbus and Boeing. Currently, just two aircraft in the airline's fleet are Russian-made - two Sukhoi SuperJet SSJ-100-95s. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the airline has made an additional 389 aircraft orders with Russian plane-makers Sukhoi, Tupolev, and Irkut (Yakovlev) to make up for canceled aircraft orders with Airbus and Boeing.</p><p>Prior to 2022, the airline had over 200 routes, connecting cities within Russia and abroad. The airline also had numerous other routes in the form of codeshares through its SKYTEAM alliance membership, which was also suspended following the resumption of the Russia-Ukraine war.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="prompt-inj-attack" src="https://chainforge.ai/docs/prompt_injection_attack.png"></p>
<p>ChainForge is an open-source visual programming environment for prompt engineering, LLM evaluation and experimentation. With ChainForge, you can evaluate the robustness of prompts and text generation models with little to no coding required. Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Query multiple LLMs at once</strong> to test prompt ideas and variations quickly and effectively. Or query the same LLM at different settings.</li>
<li><strong>Compare response quality across prompt permutations, across models, and across model settings</strong> to choose the best prompt and model for your use case. </li>
<li><strong>Setup evaluation metrics</strong> with code or LLM-based scorers and automatically plot results across prompts, prompt parameters, models, or model settings.</li>
<li><strong>Hold multiple conversations at once across template parameters and chat models.</strong> Template chat messages and inspect and evaluate outputs at each turn of a chat conversation.</li>
</ul>
<p>ChainForge is in active development and is provided as an <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/313422ed-cbd1-4b25-b51f-11e872cfb1f1">open beta test</a>.</p>

<p>David Zipper, who researches and writes about mobility and transportation, recently <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davidzipper/110843841107933007">did a big thread on Mastodon</a> (and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidzipper.bsky.social/post/3k4a4elm25e2p">Bluesky</a>) about car bloat: the way in which cars and trucks have gotten much bigger and heavier in the US over the past few decades and how it's bad for society. The whole thread is worth a read...here are a couple of Zipper's points:</p>

<blockquote><p>Tall vehicles have bigger blind spots and are more likely to strike a person's torso or head. Heavier vehicles exert more force crashing into a person, bicycle, or smaller car. They also have longer braking distances.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Heavier cars exert more pressure on tires, eroding them faster. Tire particles are absorbed into water, where they damage ecosystems. They also float through the air, harming human health when ingested.</p></blockquote>

<p>For further reading, Zipper links to a number of pieces he's written in recent months: <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90854942/the-blatant-greenwashing-of-suvs">The Blatant Greenwashing of SUVs</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/electric-vehicles-tires-wearing-out-particulates/674750/">EVs Are Sending Toxic Tire Particles Into the Water, Soil, and Air</a>, <a href="https://slate.com/business/2023/06/electric-vehicles-auto-haulers-weight-capacity-roads.html">Carry That Weight</a>, and <a href="https://slate.com/business/2022/11/suv-size-truck-bloat-pedestrian-deaths.html">The Car Safety Feature That Kills the Other Guy</a>. Zipper's solution to these problems is government action: for example, <a href="https://slate.com/business/2023/01/electric-cars-hummer-ev-tax-fees-weight-joe-biden.html">taxing vehicles by weight</a>, testing vehicles for pedestrian and cyclist safety, or requiring drivers have commercial driver's licenses for larger vehicles.</p>

soft- and hardware.</p><p><img src="https://xnacly.me/linux/linux_kernel.webp" alt="kernel_hardware"></p><p>The <code>+-/Gnu</code> in the heading is a reference to the Linux kernel using GNU code and extensions, and therefore some people
think the Linux kernel should be named with the post-fix <code>/Gnu</code> or <code>+Gnu</code>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>Most people use Linux as a synopsis for everything included in a distribution, such as kernel, drivers, desktop
environment, window manager, shell, etc. even though Linux is just the name of the kernel. Everyone knows what you’re
talking about by just calling everything Linux.</p><blockquote><p><strong>View the current kernel version and build by running</strong></p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>1</span><span>$: uname -a

</span></span></code></pre></div></blockquote><h3 id="distribution">Distribution <a href="#distribution">###</a></h3><p>As hinted above a distribution is a package of software. Most Linux distribution contain the Kernel, some sort of
desktop environment, a window manager, multiple Apps such as a word processor and a Webbrowser.</p><p>Some Distros are known for their gigantic package repositories like <a href="https://www.debian.org/index.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Debian</a> and
<a href="https://arch/linux.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arch</a>, other are famous for their security like e.g.
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies//linux-platforms/enterprise-linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RedHat</a> or the discontinued
<a href="https://www.centos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CentOS</a>. There are some distros which shine by being different or minimal, such as
<a href="https://nixos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NixOS</a> (unconventional package managing), <a href="https://artix/linux.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artix</a> (different init system)
or <a href="https://voidlinux.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Void Linux</a> (all the before + support for musl libc implementation)</p><p>No one really knows how many distros there
<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5//linux_Distribution_Timeline_21_10_2021.svg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a>, because everyone
can make one and switching between them is very easy.</p><h4 id="package-manager">Package manager <a href="#package-manager">####</a></h4><p>A package manager is a tool which installes, removes and updates software for you. No more going to a random website and
downloading an <code>*.exe</code> file only to have your hdd bricked after disabling the antivirus and running the totally
legitimate vbux generator. Package managers are accessed using the terminal, but some desktop environments include
graphical user interfaces for managing packages.</p><p>A package manager such as pacman is relatively secure due to package signing and other measures which were put in place
to save users from malicious software.</p><p>Almost all distributions contain a package manager, the most famous are: <code>apt</code>, <code>pacman</code> and <code>dnf</code>.</p><p>package manager cli examples:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span> 1</span><span><span># install a tool named neovim</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this tutorial we will use <a href="https://manjaro.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manjaro</a>, therefore you can focus on the package manager included in
the distribution: <code>pacman</code>.</p><h4 id="desktop-environment-de-vs-window-manager-wm">Desktop environment (DE) vs window manager (WM) <a href="#desktop-environment-de-vs-window-manager-wm">####</a></h4><p>A desktop environment such as <a href="https://www.gnome.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNOME</a> bundles a file manager, terminal, window manager, settings
and more into the GNOME package. Everything in it is tightly integrated and applications in the bundle often look
similar and depend on the same libraries. A <code>de</code> handles almost everything the user interacts with inside the GUI, such
as volume management, connecting to networks, mounting drives, theming and other.</p><h3 id="which-distro-to-choose">Which distro to choose? <a href="#which-distro-to-choose">###</a></h3><p>I love pacman and getting new software updates fast, therefore i personally use Arch Linux, which can sometimes require
knowledge or some time to maintain. The distro we intend to use is based on arch Linux, but has a lot of preconfigured
software, making it interesting for beginners and advanced users.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Is Manjaro better than other distros?</strong></p><p>Manjaro is not superior or inferior to any other Linux distribution, they all do the same. Manjaro has its own package
manager, themes, tools and custom Kernels.</p></blockquote><p>The above was taken from the manjaro download page and i agree wholeheartedly with the first part. Roll a die and pick a
random distro, it won’t really matter.</p><h4 id="rolling-release-vs-stable-release-continuous-delivery">Rolling release vs Stable release (Continuous delivery) <a href="#rolling-release-vs-stable-release-continuous-delivery">####</a></h4><p>To always have the newest and shiniest software at hand, one could decide to pick a distro with a rolling release
circle<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, which can at best (or worst) have several updates available a day. Like everything else RR
distros have up- and downsides, you can read further about them <a href="https://itsfoss.com/rolling-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></p><p>Releasing on a specified time frame is defined as a continuous delivery or stable releases. Distros following this
pattern have the convincing argument of stability and tested packages in their repos.</p><p>I personally never had stability issues on arch Linux and ppas annoy the shit out of me, therefore i use Arch :).</p><p>Relevant:</p><p><img src="https://xnacly.me/linux/arch.webp" alt="arch_meme"></p><h2 id="reasons-for-manjaro-linux">Reasons for Manjaro Linux <a href="#reasons-for-manjaro-linux">##</a></h2><p>As said before, in this tutorial we will be using Manjaro due to it:</p><ul><li>being based on arch<ul><li>having rolling release updates</li><li>having pacman and yay installed</li></ul></li><li>containing a fully configured system (yes bloat, idc its a beginners tutorial)</li><li>(ofc) being Linux</li></ul><h2 id="installing-a-distro">Installing a Distro <a href="#installing-a-distro">##</a></h2><blockquote><p>This section will explain how to install manjaro linux in a virtual machine in depth</p></blockquote><p>Before installing on real hardware i would recommend you to spin up a virtual machine and install Manjaro there.

					                    <!--?xml encoding="UTF-8" ?--><p>It’s important to us at Zoom to empower our customers with innovative and secure communication solutions. We’ve updated our <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terms of service</a> (in section 10.4) to further confirm that we will not use audio, video, or chat customer content to train our artificial intelligence models without your consent.</p>



<p>As part of our commitment to transparency and user control, we are providing clarity on our approach to two essential aspects of our services: Zoom’s AI features and customer content sharing for product improvement purposes. Our goal is to enable Zoom account owners and administrators to have control over these features and decisions, and we’re here to shed light on how we do that and how that affects certain customer groups.</p>



<h2><strong>Recent<em> </em>terms<em> </em>of service changes&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>We strive to provide transparency about data ownership in our terms of service. These terms of service work together with our privacy statement and in-product privacy notices, which in turn aim to ensure that usage of customer content is based on your consent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We changed our terms of service in March 2023 to be more transparent about how we use and who owns the various forms of content across our platform.&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>In Section 10.1 (coupled with 10.6), our intention was to make clear that customers create and own their own video, audio, and chat content. We have permission to use this customer content to provide value-added services based on this content, but our customers continue to own and control their content. For example, a customer may have a webinar that they ask us to livestream on YouTube. Even if we use the customer video and audio content to livestream, they own the underlying content.</li><li>Section 10.2 covers that there is certain information about how our customers in the aggregate use our product — telemetry, diagnostic data, etc. This is commonly known as service generated data. We wanted to be transparent that we consider this to be our data so that we can use service generated data to make the user experience better for everyone on our platform. For example, it is helpful to know generally what time of day in a particular region we have heavy usage so we can better balance loads in our data centers and provide better video quality for all of our users.</li><li>In Section 10.4, our intention was to make sure that if we provided value-added services (such as a meeting recording), we would have the ability to do so without questions of usage rights. The meeting recording is still owned by the customer, and we have a license to that content in order to deliver the service of recording. An example of a machine learning service for which we need license and usage rights is our automated scanning of webinar invites / reminders to make sure that we aren’t unwittingly being used to spam or defraud participants. The customer owns the underlying webinar invite, and we are licensed to provide the service on top of that content.<strong>&nbsp; For AI, we do not use audio, video, or chat content for training our models without customer consent</strong>. </li></ol><h2>What this means for healthcare and education customers</h2>



<p>We will not use customer content, including education records or protected health information, to train our artificial intelligence models without your consent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We routinely enter into student data protection agreements with our education customers and legally required business associate agreements (BAA) with our healthcare customers. Our practices and handling of education records, pupil data, and protected healthcare data are controlled by these separate terms and applicable laws.</p>



<h2 id="h-generative-ai-features"><strong>Generative AI features</strong></h2>



<p>We recently introduced two powerful generative AI features – Zoom IQ Meeting Summary and Zoom IQ Team Chat Compose – on a <strong>free trial</strong> basis to enhance your Zoom experience. These features offer automated meeting summaries and AI-powered chat composition. <strong>Zoom account owners and administrators control whether to enable these AI features for their accounts.</strong></p>



<p>When you choose to enable Zoom IQ Meeting Summary or Zoom IQ Team Chat Compose, you will also be presented with a transparent consent process for training our AI models using your customer content. Your content is used solely to improve the performance and accuracy of these AI services. And even if you chose to share your data, it will not be used for training of any third-party models.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Account owners or administrators provide consent&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Here is an example of our UI through which a customer admin opts in to one of our new generative AI features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We remain committed to transparency, and our aim is to provide you with the tools you need to make informed decisions about your Zoom account. We value your privacy and are continuously working to enhance our services while respecting your rights and preferences.</p>



<p>Thank you for being part of the Zoom community. Together, we’ll continue to create meaningful and seamless collaboration experiences through Zoom.</p>

The Linux kernel, on the other hand, began development in 1993 and was initially considered a “kludge” until the Hurd was completed. It is now matured and widely used.</p><p id="7e47">Like the Loch Ness Monster, many believe that GNU/Hurd is vaporware and does not exist. It <strong>does</strong> exist and continues to evolve, albeit at a slow pace. Just recently, the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/news/2023-06-11-debian_gnu_hurd_2023.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Debian GNU/Hurd 2023</a> has been released. You can use the GNU/Hurd right now.</p><h2 id="39db">GNU/Hurd? GNU Hurd? or Debian GNU/Hurd?</h2><p id="9e3e">There has been a well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">ideological controversy</a> over the names GNU and Linux. Anywise, it would be helpful to sort out the word.</p><p id="0bce">GNU is the name of a Unix-compatible operating system (an acronym of “GNU is Not Unix”), and the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU Project</a> is a project to create GNU. Hence, a flavor of GNU that adopted Linux as its kernel is GNU/Linux. There was also GNU/kFreeBSD, which adopted the FreeBSD kernel, although it has recently been <a href="https://blog.aurel32.net/goodbye-kfreebsd.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">discontinued</a>.</p><p id="d754">To simplify it further,</p><ul><li id="e957">Linux = kernel (the core of the operating system).</li><li id="2df7">GNU = so-called user land (the part of the operating system that is not the kernel and that deals with users, such as the GNU Core Utilities, the GNU tool chain such as GCC, etc.).</li></ul><p id="af1f">Unlike the Linux kernel, the Hurd is not a “kernel.” In a way,</p><ul><li id="798a">“Hurd” = GNU Mach (microkernel) + GNU Hurd (system servers) + <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/microkernel/mach/mig/gnu_mig.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU MIG</a> (Mach Interface Generator)</li></ul><p id="a9b7">are roughly equivalent to a “kernel.” The GNU Hurd is a herd of servers that implements many functions, including user authentication, binary execution, the file system, networking, and even /dev/null as a server separate from the kernel. There are currently <a href="https://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-doc-server" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">24 servers</a> consisting of the Hurd.</p><figure><figcaption>Linux corresponds to the left, Hurd to the middle, from Wikipedia.</figcaption></figure><p id="1714">So, although slightly imprecise, GNU Hurd (without the slash) is the name of the group of user-mode servers, and GNU/Hurd is the name of the Unix-compatible operating system that uses the “Hurd” as its “kernel.” Therefore, a kind of GNU that adopted the Hurd is an operating system called GNU/Hurd.</p><p id="cfbe">There are already several distributions based on GNU/Hurd. The best known is <a href="https://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/index.en.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Debian GNU/Hurd</a>. I am using this one because I am a Debian developer and familiar with Debian. The <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/download/latest/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU Guix system on the GNU Hurd</a> is another interesting one.</p><h2 id="6f7d">Running Debian GNU/Hurd in the cloud</h2><p id="e39d">The GNU Hurd’s hardware support is poor, so trying to run it on modern physical machines is suicide. In the cloud, however, “virtual” devices are standardized. There is no need to support various devices as in the real world.</p><p id="43d4">However, <a href="https://wiki.libvirt.org/Virtio.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">virtio</a> still needs to be supported by the current GNU/Hurd. So we have to get creative. Having a cloud provider based on <a href="https://www.openstack.org/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">OpenStack</a> would be nice, since we have to tweak the image parameters directly using command line tools. I use <a href="https://fuga.cloud/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Fuga Cloud</a>.</p><p id="212c">First, download and deploy the image.</p><pre><span id="a5ed">$ wget http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/12.0/hurd-i386/debian-hurd.img.tar.xz<br>$ tar xJf debian-hurd.img.tar.xz</span></pre><p id="e359">This is a 5GB pre-installed image, consisting of 4GB of user space and 1GB of swap space. This should be enough for now, since GNU/Hurd is a tiny OS compared to Linux.</p><p id="7cdf">The next thing you need is an OpenStack command-line tool. For Debian or Ubuntu, for example, there is a <a href="https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/python3-openstackclient" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">python3-openstackclient</a> package. I have no experience with it, but it seems to be available for Windows as well. Then you have to do some setup. Fuga Cloud’s OpenStack CLI tutorials (<a href="https://docs.fuga.cloud/how-to-use-the-openstack-cli-tools-on-linux" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">for Linux</a>, f<a href="https://docs.fuga.cloud/how-to-use-the-openstack-cli-tools-on-windows" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">or Windows</a>) are useful even if you don’t use them.</p><p id="dd47">Now you need to upload the image to the cloud. You need to set the properties: “hw_disk_bus” to “ide” and “hw_vif_model” to “e1000” (or “rtl8139”) as these are only supported devices on GNU/Hurd. Also, uploading may take some time. A progress bar ( — progress) would be nice.</p><pre><span id="57c1">$ openstack image create --property hw_disk_bus=ide --property hw_cdrom_bus=ide --property hw_vif_model=e1000 --disk-format raw --container-format bare "Debian GNU/Hurd 2023" --file debian-hurd.img --progress</span></pre><p id="7af4">After that, you can use the OpenStack web interface to create an instance based on the custom image you just uploaded. I am using one of Fuga Cloud’s cheapest plans (“t2.small”: 1 CPU, 1.23 GB RAM, 20 GiB SSD), but it seems to be enough.</p><p id="dd52">After booting (via GRUB), open the console for now from OpenStack and log in as “root” (the password is empty, so simply hit Enter). After that, you can immediately create your own user account.</p><pre><span id="a26e"># adduser yourloginname</span></pre><figure><figcaption>A gnu will welcome you.</figcaption></figure><p id="c8dd">This image is prepared to configure the network with DHCP, so you should already be able to log in with SSH (using your user account’s login password) once the instance is booted. Then, you put your SSH public key in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, and you can SSH login as usual.</p><p id="496e">Everything else can be handled similarly to Debian GNU/Linux, because it is Debian after all. If you are using it as a server that is open to the outside world, don’t forget to set the root password.</p><h2 id="c90b">Why GNU/Hurd?</h2><p id="f7bf">GNU/Hurd has a number of interesting features. The most famous of these is probably the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/translator.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">translator</a>. The translator allows users to create local implementations of the programs that handle access to specific directories and files. It is like a supercharged version of mount. It implements symbolic links, sockets, etc. The translator provides extreme flexibility.</p><p id="f34d">It is possible to run multiple instances of the Hurd on a single instance of GNU Mach, the microkernel. It’s called <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/neighborhurd.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">neighborhurd</a>. Each neighborhurd is essentially isolated, so it’s like a supercharged Docker. There is also <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/subhurd.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">subhurd</a>, which uses some of the resources provided by another Hurd.</p><p id="f0df">Personally, one reason for using GNU/Hurd is that the Linux kernel has become too huge. Look at this:</p><figure><figcaption>Source Lines of Code Comparison. Measured by David A Wheeler’s <a href="https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">SLOCCount</a>.</figcaption></figure><p id="1f5c">I don’t think that anyone is able to grasp the full picture of Linux anymore. It was also said that the Hurd would never be finished because it was too complex and too large. That is no longer the case. <strong>GNU/Hurd is a relatively small OS!</strong> Maybe the development of the microkernel and the Hurd required the development of Linux and the development of virtualization after all.</p><p id="83ac">Also, there are a variety of interesting budding operating systems, but they are largely experimental and often not practically usable; the GNU/Hurd is Unix(POSIX)-compatible, so most things work (roughly 65% of the Debian archive can be built for the Hurd).</p><h2 id="fdfe">Challenges</h2><p id="852e">One big problem would be systemd. systemd has not yet (or forever) been ported to the Hurd. systemd is very popular in the Linux world these days, and there are many packages that depend on systemd. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU shepherd</a> is promising, but not yet complete.</p><p id="0922">As mentioned above, hardware support for GNU/Hurd is poor, but it is hard to rewrite device drivers from scratch now. <a href="https://rumpkernel.github.io/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Rump Kernels</a> is an interesting solution and is being actively implemented (<a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/dzammit/attachments/slides/4850/export/events/attachments/dzammit/slides/4850/rump_hurd_talk.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">a nice recent FOSDEM presentation PDF</a>).</p><p id="2ee0">And, of course, there are a whole lot of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/open_issues.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">open issues</a>.</p><h2 id="153c">Conclusion</h2><p id="e992"><strong>Try GNU/Hurd</strong>!

I am pretty sure you will like it too.</p><h2 id="b9a0"><strong>Further Resources</strong></h2><ul><li id="9dd8"><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The Official site of GNU Hurd</a></li><li id="e032"><a href="https://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/index.en.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The Official site of Debian GNU/Hurd</a></li><li id="0938"><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/mailing_lists.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Mailing Lists and its archives</a></li><li id="c81e"><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/irc.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">IRC</a> (Looks like this is still the official communication channel in 2023…)</li></ul><h2 id="11ea">The Source Code of the Hurd</h2><p id="6f7e">They are all managed by Git.</p><ul><li id="fdb1"><a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/gnumach.git" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU Mach</a></li><li id="a567"><a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/hurd.git/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU Hurd</a></li><li id="24c9"><a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/mig.git/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU MIG</a></li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><h2>TL;DR</h2><p>WarpStream is a Kafka protocol compatible data streaming platform built directly on top of S3. It's delivered as a single, stateless Go binary so there are no local disks to manage, no brokers to rebalance, and no ZooKeeper to operate. WarpStream is 5-10x cheaper than Kafka in the cloud because data streams directly to and from S3 instead of using inter-zone networking, which can be over 80% of the infrastructure cost of a Kafka deployment at scale.</p><p>If you just want to get your hands dirty, you can try <a href="https://docs.warpstream.com/warpstream/tutorials/demo" target="_blank">our demo</a> in under 30s.</p><p>Otherwise, read on!</p><h2>Kafka is Dead, Long Live Kafka</h2><p>Chances are you probably had a strong reaction to the title of this post. In our experience, Kafka is one of the most polarizing technologies in the data space. Some people hate it, some people swear by it, but almost every technology company uses it.</p><p>Kafka was first open sourced in 2011, and quickly became the default infrastructure for building streaming architectures. Jay Kreps' now well-known <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying" target="_blank">The Log</a> blog post is still one of my favorite blog posts ever because it walks through why the distributed log abstraction that Kafka provides is so powerful.</p><p>But it’s not 2011 anymore. A lot has changed about how we build modern software, primarily a major shift towards cloud environments, and yet Kafka has remained more or the less the same. Many organizations have managed to “lift and shift” Kafka into their cloud environments, but let’s be honest, nobody is really happy with the result. Kafka is expensive, finicky, and difficult to run for most organizations who use it.</p><p>Kafka <em>itself</em> is not the problem. It’s a great piece of software that was well suited for the environment it was created for: LinkedIn’s data centers in 2011. However, it is an unusually poor fit for modern workloads for two reasons:</p><ol role="list"><li>Cloud economics – by design, Kafka’s replication strategy will rack up massive inter AZ bandwidth costs.</li><li>Operational overhead – running your own Kafka cluster literally requires a dedicated team and sophisticated custom tooling.</li></ol><p>We're going to pick on Kafka for the rest of this post, but keep in mind that everything we're saying about Kafka applies equally to any similar system that stores data on locals disks (however briefly), regardless of which programming language its implemented in.</p><h2>Kafka-nomics</h2><p>The diagram below depicts a typical 3 availability zone Kafka cluster:&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/64c00427b989db231aac3e45_kafka_arch.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Every GiB of data that is produced must be written cross zone 2/3rds of the time<sup>1</sup>, and subsequently replicated by the partition leader to the followers in the other two zones for durability and availability reasons. Every time a GiB of data is transferred across zones, it costs $0.02<sup>2</sup>, $0.01 for egress in the source zone and $0.01 for ingress in the destination zone.</p><p>$0.01*⅔ + $0.02 *2 == $0.053 for every GiB of data that you stream through your Kafka cluster <em>in the best case scenario<sup>3</sup></em>. The cost of storing a GiB of data in S3 <em>for a month</em> is only $0.021<sup>4</sup>, so for the same price as copying data from a producer to a consumer via Kafka, you could store that data in S3 <em>for over two months</em>. In practice, for any Kafka cluster with substantial throughput, the hardware costs are negligible since 70-90% of the cost of the workload is just inter-zone bandwidth fees. <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/understanding-and-optimizing-your-kafka-costs-part-1-infrastructure/#networking" target="_blank">Confluent has a good write up about this problem as well</a>.</p><p>It’s important to stress that this inter-AZ bandwidth problem is fundamental to how Kafka works. Kafka was designed to run in LinkedIn’s data centers, where the network engineers didn’t charge their application developers for moving data around. But today, most Kafka users are running it on a public cloud, an environment with completely different constraints and cost models. Unfortunately, unless your organization can commit to 10s or 100s of millions of dollars per year in cloud spend, there is no escaping the physics of this problem.</p><p>It’s not just a question of throughput either, even a low throughput Kafka cluster with long retention can have large storage requirements. In this case, Kafka’s approach of triply replicating the data on expensive local SSDs costs roughly 10-20x more<sup>5</sup> per GiB than using object storage like S3 assuming the <em>best case scenario of 100% disk utilization.</em></p><h2>Accidental SRE</h2><p>Most developers first encounter Kafka because they have a real problem they want to solve. However, before they can begin solving their problems, they must first learn about:</p><ol role="list"><li>Kafka (brokers, coordinators, watermarks, etc)</li><li>ZooKeeper (or KRaft)</li><li>Leader elections</li><li>Partitions (how many partitions do I need? Unclear, but better get it right because you can never change it!)</li><li>Consumer groups</li><li>Rebalancing</li><li>Broker tuning</li><li>Client tuning</li><li>etc</li></ol><p>Kafka’s “data plane” (brokers) and consensus-based “control plane” (controllers, ZooKeeper, etc) all run directly on local SSDs that must be managed with expertise and care. In practice, self-hosted Kafka clusters require a dedicated team of experts and significant amounts of custom tooling before even basic operations like node replacements and scaling clusters can be performed safely and reliably. For example, the Apache Kafka built in partition reassignment tool cannot even generate plans for decommissioning brokers when you (inevitably) experience a hardware failure:</p><blockquote>The partition reassignment tool does not have the ability to automatically generate a reassignment plan for decommissioning brokers yet. As such, the admin has to come up with a reassignment plan to move the replica for all partitions hosted on the broker to be decommissioned, to the rest of the brokers. This can be relatively tedious as the reassignment needs to ensure that all the replicas are not moved from the decommissioned broker to only one other broker.</blockquote><p>In many cases, offloading cluster management to a hosted provider like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/msk/" target="_blank">AWS MSK</a> doesn’t even solve the operational burden problem. For example, the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/bestpractices.html#bestpractices-balance-cluster" target="_blank">MSK documentation on how to rebalance a cluster</a> (a very routine operation) just links to the <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#basic_ops_cluster_expansion" target="_blank">Apache Kafka documentation</a> which involves hand-editing JSON to specify which partitions should be migrated to which brokers and includes helpful commentary like:</p><blockquote>The partition reassignment tool does not have the capability to automatically study the data distribution in a Kafka cluster and move partitions around to attain an even load distribution. As such, the admin has to figure out which topics or partitions should be moved around.</blockquote><p>There are open source solutions like <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control" target="_blank">Cruise Control</a> that can help ease this burden, but that is yet another set of concepts that need to learned, services that need to deployed and monitored, and sharp edges that need to be encountered. Cruise Control itself is a JVM&nbsp;application that depends on both Apache Kafka and ZooKeeper. Hardly a lightweight solution.</p><p>Unfortunately, in many cases developers set out to solve a business problem, and end up becoming Kafka SREs instead.</p><h2>S3 Is All You Need</h2><p>The high costs of using Kafka (both in dollars and engineering hours) means that today businesses can only afford to use it for their most high value use-cases like fraud detection and CDC. The cost of entry is simply too high for anything else.</p><p>When we were at Datadog, we built <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/introducing-husky/" target="_blank">Husky, a columnar database purpose-built for observability data that ran directly on top of S3.</a> When we were done, we had a (mostly) stateless and auto scaling data lake that was extremely cost effective, never ran out of disk space, and was trivial to operate. Almost overnight our Kafka clusters suddenly looked <em>ancient</em> by comparison.</p><p>Kafka bandwidth volumes at Datadog were measured in double-digit GiB/s and broker storage was measured in PiB’s of NVMEs<sup>6</sup>. Maintaining this level of infrastructure using open source Kafka, custom tooling, and bare VMs was no small feat. Luckily the responsible engineering teams at Datadog were extremely capable and made it work, but even after many years of investment, the automation simply couldn’t compete with the millions of engineering hours that have gone into making systems like S3 extremely robust, scalable, cost effective, <em>and elastic</em>.</p><p>In general, large storage workloads running in cloud environments stand no chance of competing with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc3J4McebHE" target="_blank">economics, reliability, scalability, and elasticity of object storage</a>. This is why “big data” technologies like Snowflake and Databricks don’t even try. Instead, they <em>lean into</em> cloud economics by designing their systems from the ground up around commodity object storage.</p><p>Companies like Uber, Datadog, and many others have made Kafka work for them despite all of its flaws. But there are <em>so many </em>interesting problems that will never get solved if the existing Kafka implementation remains the barrier to entry. That’s why we care about this space, and that’s why we set out to build something that would make data streaming infrastructure as accessible as S3.</p><p>If we could build a Kafka-like system directly on top of S3, that would solve two of the major problems with Kafka in one fell swoop; costs would be massively reduced, and most traditional Kafka operational headaches would disappear overnight. No major cloud provider charges for networking costs between VMs and object storage, and AWS employs literally <em>hundreds</em> of engineers whose only job is to make sure that S3 runs reliably and scales infinitely, so you don’t have to.</p><p>Of course, that’s easier said than done, and there is a good reason no one has done it yet: figuring out how to build low latency streaming infrastructure on-top of a high latency storage medium like S3, while still providing the full semantics of the Kafka protocol, without introducing <em>any</em> local disks, is a very tricky problem!</p><p>So we asked ourselves: “What would Kafka look like if it was redesigned from the ground up <em>today</em> to run in modern cloud environments, directly on top of object storage, with no local disks to manage, but still had to support the existing Kafka protocol?”</p><p>WarpStream is our answer to that question.</p><h2>Introducing WarpStream</h2><p>WarpStream is a Kafka protocol compatible data streaming platform that runs directly on top of any commodity object store (AWS&nbsp;S3, GCP&nbsp;GCS, Azure Blob Storage, etc). It incurs zero inter-AZ bandwidth costs, has no local disks to manage, and can run completely within your VPC.</p><p>That’s a lot to digest, so let’s unpack it by comparing WarpStream’s architecture to Kafka’s:</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/64cea23a28ed31049a11cfbf_with1%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Instead of Kafka brokers, WarpStream has “Agents”. Agents are stateless Go binaries (no JVM!) that speak the Kafka protocol, but unlike a traditional Kafka broker, any WarpStream Agent can act as the “leader” for any topic, commit offsets for any consumer group, or act as the coordinator for the cluster. No Agent is special, so auto-scaling them based on CPU-usage or network bandwidth is trivial.</p><p>How did we accomplish this if Apache Kafka requires running Apache ZooKeeper (or KRaft) and a bunch of stateful brokers with local SSDs and replication?</p><ol role="list"><li>We separated storage and compute (by offloading data to S3)</li><li>We separated data from metadata (by offloading metadata to a custom metadata store)</li></ol><p>Offloading all storage to object storage like S3 allows users to trivially scale the number of WarpStream Agents in response to changes in load with <em>zero data rebalancing</em>. It also enables faster recovery from failures because any request can be retried on another Agent immediately. It also mostly eliminates hotspots, where some Kafka brokers would have dramatically higher load than others due to uneven amounts of data in each partition. That means you can say goodbye to manually rebalancing partitions, and don't need to learn about complex solutions like Cruise Control.</p><p>The other pillar of WarpStream's design is separating data from metadata, just like a modern data lake does. We store the metadata for every WarpStream “Virtual Cluster” in a custom metadata database that was written from the ground up to solve this exact problem in the most performant and cost effective way possible. In fact, we’re so confident in the efficiency of our metadata store, we’ll host WarpStream Virtual Clusters for you <a href="https://warpstream.com/pricing"><em>for free</em></a>.</p><p>You can read more about <a href="https://docs.warpstream.com/warpstream/background-information/warpstreams-architecture" target="_blank">WarpStream’s architecture in our documentation</a>, but to summarize: WarpStream offloads all of the hard problems of data replication, durability, and availability to an object storage bucket so you never have to think about it, but all of your data <em>stays inside your cloud account</em>. The only data that ever leaves your cloud account with WarpStream is the workload <em>metadata</em> that is required for consensus, like the order of the batches in your partitions.</p><p>Modern practitioners who want to introduce large scale data streaming pipelines into their infrastructure today don’t have many good choices. They either have to spend a lot of money <em>and</em> create an entire dedicated team of engineers whose only job is to operate Kafka, or they have to pay a vendor for a hosted solution and spend <em>even more money</em>, making many of their streaming use-cases economically infeasible.</p><p>We think WarpStream can provide a better option that leverages the cloud as a strength instead of a weakness, and unlocks a whole new set of possibilities in the data streaming world.</p><p>You don’t just have to take our word for it though, we brought receipts! The image below shows the interzone networking costs of our entire cloud account (measured using the excellent <a href="https://www.vantage.sh/" target="_blank">vantage.sh</a>), including the continuous streaming workload we run in our test environment. This workload continuously produces 140MiB/s of data and consumes it with three dedicated consumers for a total of 560MiB/s in continuous data transfer.</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/64c035b364da3c257915926f_Screenshot%202023-07-25%20at%203.49.10%20PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>You can see that we average &lt; $15/day in interzone networking fees, whereas the exact same workload run using a Kafka cluster would cost 0.14GiB * $0.053/GiB * 60 * 60 * 24 == <strong>$641</strong> <strong>per day</strong> <strong>in interzone networking fees alone.</strong></p><p>We didn’t just replace these interzone networking costs with hardware or S3 API costs either. This same workload costs &lt; $40/day in S3 API operation costs:</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/64c035bcfda4aa35de9d76ef_Screenshot%202023-07-25%20at%203.50.11%20PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>It also only requires 27 vCPUs worth of Agent hardware / VMs.</p><p>In terms of total cost of ownership, WarpStream will reduce the cost of most Kafka workloads by 5-10x. For example, here is a comparison of the cost of running a sustained 1GiB/s Kafka workload vs the equivalent using WarpStream:</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/64d060d06b645b27d6a23140_Screenshot%202023-08-06%20at%2010.10.56%20PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Footnote 7 for self hosted Kafka hardware costs, footnote 8 for self hosted Kafka network costs.<strong> Note that this table assumes the best case scenario that the Kafka cluster is properly configured to use the follower fetch functionality to reduce interzone networking costs for consumers. If it’s not, the Kafka costs would be much higher.&nbsp;It also omits the cost of engineering salaries for the self hosted Kafka setup.</strong></figcaption></figure><p>The table above demonstrates clearly that for high volume Kafka workloads, the hardware costs are negligible because the cost of the workload is dominated by inter-zone networking fees. WarpStream eliminates those networking fees entirely.</p><p>Of course, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Engineering is about trade-offs, and we’ve made a significant one with WarpStream: latency. The current implementation has a P99 of ~400ms for Produce requests because we never acknowledge data until it has been durably persisted in S3 and committed to our cloud control plane. In addition, our current P99 latency of data end-to-end from producer-to-consumer is around 1s:</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/64bff6c3e52acac923301fa7_CaSz12FWNfCOGHT2snOa6q1erJeqvhESfRx_X6ZHt-Fe81JVVgRlXk9wvSamfMnzG5Epjwl5VARA176g8k-kmAGiTancoQOoBT1iDZJgjKXceXv-XFKsnEn2ncDGM4rjeCja_JriSlDDn7LQ9B8vh5o.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>If your workload can tolerate a P99 of ~1s of producer-to-consumer latency, then WarpStream can reduce your total data streaming costs by 5-10x per GiB, with <em>almost</em> zero operational overhead. We don’t have a proprietary interface either; it’s just Kafka, so there is no vendor lock in. Finally, WarpStream runs in any environment with an object store implementation, so we can meet you where you’re at with S3 in AWS, GCS in GCP, and Azure Blob Storage in Azure.</p><p>If you’ve made it this far, you may have noticed that WarpStream mainly addresses two of the major problems with Kafka: cloud economics and operational overhead. We think that there is a third major problem with Kafka: developer UX. In our view, partitions are way too low level of an abstraction to program against for writing any non-trivial stream processing application, and we think that WarpStream’s architecture puts us in a unique position to help developers write stream processing applications in a novel way that’s much closer to how they’re used to writing traditional applications.</p><p>We’ll talk about that more in a future blog post, but the first thing we wanted to do is meet developers where they are and offer them an improved version of a tool they’re already familiar with.</p><p>WarpStream is currently in developer preview.

<p><strong>NAIROBI, Kenya, Aug 7 – Police raided a warehouse belonging to WorldCoin cryptocurrency in Nairobi and carted away documents over the weekend.</strong>



</p><p>The officers went to the offices along Mombasa Road armed with a search warrant and left with machines they believe stores data gathered by the firm.



</p><p>The team took the data to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters for analysis.



</p><p>Data Commissioner Immaculate Kassait defended her office and said Tools for Humanity, the parent company of Worldcoin, failed to disclose its true intentions during registration.



</p><p>The government has suspended Worldcoin’s operations in Kenya, citing security concerns paving the way for investigations into the activities of the company.



</p><p>However, privacy experts worry that sensitive data gathered from scanning a person’s iris might get into the wrong hands.



</p><p>The Kenyan Capital Markets Authority (CMA) stated it was concerned about the ongoing registration and notified Kenyans that Worldcoin was not regulated in Kenya.



</p><p>Under Kenyan law, individuals have a right to not have any personal information unnecessarily required or unnecessarily revealed.



</p><p>Worldcoin, founded by US tech entrepreneur Sam Altman, offers free crypto tokens to people who agree to have their eyeballs scanned.</p>



<p>&nbsp;On Thursday, Worldcoin said it is planning to implement crowd-control measures and collaborate with the government before resuming work.



</p><p>Worldcoin, founded by US tech entrepreneur Sam Altman, offers free crypto tokens to people who agree to have their eyeballs scanned.



</p><p>It claims to be creating a new global “identity and financial network”.



</p><p>Altman, who founded Open AI, which built chat bot ChatGPT, says he hopes the initiative will help confirm if someone is a human or a robot. He also says this could lead to everyone being paid a universal basic income but it is not clear how.



</p><p>Worldcoin says it chose Kenya as the first African country to launch the platform because of the already booming tech space, and the more than four million Kenyans who are already trading in crypto.



</p><p>It has also launched in various countries including Indonesia, France Japan, Germany, Spain and the UK. Data watchdogs in some countries have already said they are examining Worldcoin.



</p><p>Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki suspended the firm’s activities in Kenya to pave the way for a probe into the legality of its operations.



</p><p>He Thursday appeared before Parliament to among other issues state the precautionary steps taken by the government on the already mined data.



</p><p>“The aforesaid entity is not registered as a legal entity in Kenya.”</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>devlooper</code> is a program synthesis agent that autonomously fixes its output by running tests!</p>
<p dir="auto">Here's <code>devlooper</code> in action, taking 11 iterations to create a Python library that generates voronoi diagrams:</p>
<p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5786378/257645025-0dfa6086-96e2-484b-92c8-23d1017471ab.gif"><img width="600" alt="devlooper demo" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5786378/257645025-0dfa6086-96e2-484b-92c8-23d1017471ab.gif"></a>
</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">⚙️ How it works</h2>
<p dir="auto">This project extends <a href="https://github.com/smol-ai/developer">smol developer</a> by giving it access to a <a href="https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandbox" rel="nofollow">sandbox</a> to run tests in. The agent iterates until all tests pass, by updating the code and fixing the environment (installing packages).</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><g-emoji alias="package" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4e6.png">📦</g-emoji> Environment templates</h3>
<p dir="auto">The project uses environment "templates" to define the basic setup and test harness for a given language/framework. For now, three templates are provided:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>React + Jest</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Rust</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">However, any language/framework should work, as long as it can be installed within a container. Contributions for more templates are welcome (see <a href="https://github.com/modal-labs/devlooper/blob/main/src/env_templates.py"><code>env_templates.py</code></a>).</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🏖️ Sandbox</h3>
<p dir="auto">We use <a href="http://modal.com/" rel="nofollow">Modal</a>'s new <a href="https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandbox" rel="nofollow">Sandbox</a> primitive to run tests in an isolated environment and fetch the output. This allows us to construct the image incrementally as well (similar to building up a Dockerfile in layers that are cached).</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><g-emoji alias="robot" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f916.png">🤖</g-emoji> Debug loop</h3>
<p dir="auto">In each iteration, the agent runs the test command for the environment. If a non-zero exit code is received, the agent passes the <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> from the sandbox to the LLM to diagnose the error. This diagnosis is used in a separate step to generate a <code>DebugPlan</code> consisting of three types of actions:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Inspect and fix a file</li>
<li>Install a package in the image</li>
<li>Run commands in the image</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">More types of actions can be implemented pretty easily — once again, contributions are welcome!</p>
<p dir="auto">Running the diagnosis as a separate step seems to boost model accuracy by quite a bit (instead of immediately predicting the <code>DebugPlan</code>). We suspect the benefits are similar to why Chain-of-Thought prompting works so well.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧑‍🚀 Usage</h2>

<p dir="auto">This project is mostly a proof of concept, and there's a lot of cool additions that will make this better. Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Allowing feedback from users in the loop, or accepting an existing project + plan as input and making suggested changes to it.</li>
<li>Making the debugging prompt better with relevant parts of the code, retrieved using embeddings.</li>
<li>Go out and fetch the documentation for a package if needed.</li>
<li>Using previous edits in the prompt somewhere to prevent the model from going into a loop.</li>
<li>Synthesizing <code>EnvTemplate</code>s from scratch.</li>
<li>Generalizing this to more LLMs, including open-source ones!</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h2>Snappy UIs With WebAssembly and Web Workers</h2>
	<p>Published: 2023-08-07</p>
	<p>Our web app allows users can change the length of a song or find loops present in it for infinite listening, remixing, or for their next next video edit or performance. After uploading a song, there is an initial server-side analysis step after which the audio can be manipulated completely in the browser. Users can alter the desired length or mark sections of audio to prefer or avoid which will regenerate results. To make these manipulations responsive and snappy, computations happen client-side and do not need another network call (which would introduce additional latency). To make this possible, we rely on using a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WebAssembly</a> binary executed inside of a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Web Worker</a> (several of them actually, running in parallel). In this post, we will go over some more details of how this works.</p>
<h3>Running Fast(er) With WebAssembly</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WebAssembly</a> allows web developers to use low-level code delivered in a binary format that runs at speeds you would not be able to achieve with just JavaScript. WebAssembly (or Wasm for short) describes a low-level assembly-like language that can be targeted from a higher-level language like C, C++, or Rust. The nice thing is that you get to choose which language you want to use, as long as you can find a way to compile it down to a Wasm binary!</p>
<p>We use <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AssemblyScript</a> which allows us to write our high-level code in TypeScript (strongly typed JavaScript). Since the rest of our client-side code is also written in TypeScript (which in turn gets compiled to “regular” JavaScript), this allows us to share code between the code delivered as part of our UI (using JS) and the binary (using Wasm). We get to share type definitions of the data being passed in and out of the compiled binary and some interop that makes it easier to pass data back and forth. While code written with AssemblyScript looks very similar to TypeScript, it needs some modifications before being able to be compiled with AssemblyScript (by defining more granular types for example).</p>
<p>AssemblyScript code might look something like the following:</p>
<pre><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>compute</span><span>(</span>array<span>:</span> StaticArray<span>&lt;</span>f64<span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> target<span>:</span> i32<span>)</span><span>:</span> Result <span>{</span>
	<span>const</span> total <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
	<span>const</span> sum <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

	<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> total<span>;</span> i<span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		sum <span>+=</span> array<span>[</span>i<span>]</span><span>;</span>
	<span>}</span>

	<span>return</span> <span>{</span> sum <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>
<p>Here, we are writing a function that sums up the first 10 items from <code>array</code> and returns it wrapped in an object. In our code, we return more than just one item inside of this object. The nice thing with AssemblyScript is that it will take care of properly passing this structured data across the JS/Wasm boundary.</p>
<h3>Keeping Things Responsive With Web Workers</h3>
<p>While the Wasm binary is faster than a JavaScript implementation would be, it still takes a non-neglible time to run. If we were to just call the <code>compute</code> function inside of our Svelte front-end, we would run it in the main thread and lock up the UI, causing a bad user experience as the webpage would appear frozen. To fix this, we run that code inside of a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Web Worker</a>. Doing this will allow us to run the search algorithm in a separate thread so the main thread is available to respond to the user.</p>
<p>In our case, to perform a search, a worker needs some context on the structure of the song. We first initialize a worker with the song analysis results from the server (this requires us to send data from the main thread into the worker thread), then ask it to execute a search with the target length. Since this context only changes when the user changes the song they are working on, we can reuse a worker given we are editing the same song and just need to vary the target duration or the preferences.</p>
<p>Since that code runs in separate execution context in a separate thread, how can we implement cross-thread communication? Using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Channel_Messaging_API" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Channel Messaging API</a>’s <code>postMessage</code> method! This method allows us to send a message across the thread boundary.</p>
<p>Our code that manages the worker looks something like the following:</p>
<pre><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code><span>import</span> Worker <span>from</span> <span>"./worker?worker"</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> worker <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Worker</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<p>Note: as <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36489267" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pointed out on Hacker News</a>, if you are running Firefox, the dynamic import above <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1540913" rel="noopener" target="_blank">requires Firefox 113 or newer</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, keeping a copy of the search result is possible since the analysis context required is shared across searches. This avoids some overhead when the user initializes a new search (by altering the target length or region preferences) by avoiding having to copy it in for every search.</p>
<h3>Reusing Workers</h3>
<p>In Mofi, users get to choose from multiple results of generated songs. Since these searches can run in parallel and we want to get results shown to the user as quickly as possible, we run multiple instances of Web Workers at the same time. This allows us to have results “trickle in” as each worker finishes processing.</p>
<p><img src="https://mofi.loud.red/_app/immutable/assets/results.72e94103.png" alt="Screenshot of multiple search results"></p>
<p>We don’t want to run too many workers at once, however: after we reach the number of physical cores, the cost of switching between threads starts to outweight the benefits of parallelization and computation incurs a performance hit. To manage this, we use a pool of workers. When a new request comes in to look for a result, we try to find a worker that will handle the request:</p>
<ul><li>If we haven’t filled the pool of workers yet, we have space to create one, so we initialize a new instance of the worker and populate it with data. Once it has finished initialization, we can send over the request.</li>
<li>If there is an idle worker in our pool, we take one and let it perform the search. The advantage of this is that reusing the worker allows us to skip initialization since it already has the context needed to perform the search.</li>
<li>If there is no idle worker, we add the request along with a callback to a list of waiting tasks. Once a worker finishes a task, the scheduler takes the next task off of the queue and processes it.</li></ul>
<p>Having a pool of workers also let’s us stop all searches by terminating all workers:</p>
<pre><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>terminate</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	waitingTasks <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
	busyWorkers<span>.</span><span>forEach</span><span>(</span><span>(</span>worker<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> worker<span>.</span><span>terminate</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
	busyWorkers <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>
<p>This happens when the user issues a new search. At this point, all running workers are looking for outdated results so we don’t need them anymore.</p>
<h3>Tip: Progress Updates</h3>
<p>A worker can only return data once completed, but we also want to show a progress indicator even when its task has not finished. To do this, inside of the worker code, we create a global <code>onProgress</code> helper function that allows us to send a message to the main thread like this:</p>
<pre><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code><span>(</span>globalThis <span>as</span> <span>any</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>onProgress</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>ratio<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>postMessage</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
		type<span>:</span> <span>"progress"</span><span>,</span>
		data<span>:</span> ratio<span>,</span>
	<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>
<p>Then, inside the AssemblyScript code, we can add this:</p>
<pre><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code><span><span>@</span><span>external</span></span><span>(</span><span>"env"</span><span>,</span> <span>"onProgress"</span><span>)</span>
<span>export</span> <span>declare</span> <span>function</span> <span>onProgress</span><span>(</span>ratio<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>void</span><span>;</span></code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>
<p>which allows us to “import” the function and call it inside of the Wasm binary and send incremental updates before returning the final result:</p>
<pre><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><code><span><span>+</span><span> import { onProgress } from "./glue";
</span></span>
export function compute(array: StaticArray&lt;f64&gt;, target: i32): Result {
	const total = 10;
	const sum = 0;

	for (let i = 0; i &lt; total; i++) {
		sum += array[i];
<span><span>+</span><span>		onProgress(i / total);
</span></span>	}

	return { sum };
}</code><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></pre>
<p>This is a simplified example and this loop would finish fast, but in the case of long-running loop iterations the progress updates will be more beneficial.</p>
<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>
<p>Using WebAssembly and Web Workers, we are able to shift the iterative aspect of Mofi’s audio manipulation to the client to make the experience more responsive and snappy. This project was exciting for me to build because it got me using novel web technologies to build a performant application that mostly runs in the browser. In the future, I hope to be able to analyze the audio in the browser too, but it looks difficult to do at this stage.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading, and if you haven’t already, please give Mofi a try!</p></article></div>]]></description>

<p><span>People sometimes ask me: </span>“<span>Alex, how do I learn X?</span>”<span>. This article is a compilation of advice I</span>

<p><span>I don</span>’<span>t think I have any useful advice on how to learn programming from zero. The rest of the post</span>
<span>assumes that you at least can, given sufficient time, write simple programs. E.g., a program that</span>
<span>reads a list of integers from an input textual file, sorts them using a quadratic algorithm, and</span>
<span>writes the result to a different file.</span></p>

<em><span>easily</span></em><span> write a program to sort a list of integers</span>”<span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Later problems are very heavily math based. If you are mathematically inclined, this is perfect </span>—

<section id="On-Mentorship">

    <h3>
    <a href="#On-Mentorship"><span>On Mentorship</span> </a>
    </h3>
<p><span>Having a great mentor is fantastic, but mentors are not always available. Luckily, programming can</span>
<span>be mastered without a mentor, if you got past the initial learning step. When you code, you get </span><em><span>a</span>
<span>lot</span></em><span> of feedback, and, through trial and error, you can process the feedback to improve your skills.</span>
<span>In fact, the hardest bit is actually finding the problems to solve (and this article suggests many).</span>
<span>But if you have the problem, you can self-improve noticing the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>How you verify that the solution works.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Common bugs and techniques to avoid them in the future.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Length of the solution: can you solve the problem using shorter, simpler code?</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Techniques </span>—<span> can you apply anything you</span>’<span>ve read about this week? How would the problem be solved</span>
<span>in Haskell? Could you apply pattern from language X in language Y?</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>In this context it is important to solve the same problem repeatedly. E.g., you could try solving</span>
<span>the same model problem in all languages you know, with a month or two break between attempts.</span>
<span>Repeatedly doing the same thing and noticing differences and similarities between tries is the</span>
<span>essence of self-learning.</span></p>
</section>
<section id="On-Programming-Languages">

    <h3>
    <a href="#On-Programming-Languages"><span>On Programming Languages</span> </a>
    </h3>
<p><span>Learning your first programming language is a nightmare, because you are learning your editing</span>
<span>environment (PyScripter, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code) first, simple algorithms second, and the language</span>
<span>itself third. It gets much easier afterwards!</span></p>
<p><span>Learning different programming languages is one of the best way to improve your programming skills.</span>
<span>By seeing what</span>’<span>s similar, and what</span>’<span>s different, you deeper learn how the things work under the hood.</span>
<span>Different languages put different idioms to the forefront, and learning several expands your</span>
<span>vocabulary considerably. As a bonus, after learning N languages, learning N+1st becomes a question</span>
<span>of skimming through the official docs.</span></p>
<p><span>In general, you want to cover big families of languages: Python, Java, Haskell, C, Rust, Clojure</span>
<span>would be a good baseline. Erlang, Forth, and Prolog would be good additions afterwards.</span></p>
</section>
<section id="On-Algorithms">

    <h3>
    <a href="#On-Algorithms"><span>On Algorithms</span> </a>
    </h3>
<p><span>There are three levels of learning algorithms</span></p>
<dl>
<dt><span>Level 1</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>You are not actually learning algorithms, you are learning programming. At this stage, it doesn</span>’<span>t</span>
<span>matter how long your code is, how pretty it is, or how efficient it is. The only thing that</span>
<span>matters is that it solve the problem. Generally, this level ends when you are fairly comfortable</span>
<span>with recursion. Few first problems from Project Euler are a great resource here.</span></p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Level 2</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>Here you learn algorithms proper. The goal here is mostly encyclopedic knowledge of common</span>
<span>techniques. There are quite a few, but not too many of those. At this stage, the most useful thing</span>
<span>is understanding the math behind the algorithms </span>—<span> being able to explain algorithm using</span>
<span>pencil&amp;paper, prove its correctness, and analyze Big-O runtime. Generally, you want to learn the</span>
<span>name of algorithm or technique, read and grok the full explanation, and then implement it.</span></p>
<p><span>I recommend doing an abstract implementation first (i.e., not </span>“<span>HashMap to solve problem X</span>”<span>, but</span>
“<span>just HashMap</span>”<span>). Include tests in your implementation. Use randomized testing (e.g., when testing</span>
<span>sorting algorithms, don</span>’<span>t use a finite set of example, generate a million random ones).</span></p>
<p><span>It</span>’<span>s OK and even desirable to implement the same algorithm multiple times. When solving problems,</span>
<span>like CSES, you </span><em><span>could</span></em><span> abstract your solutions and re-use them, but it</span>’<span>s better to code everything</span>
<span>from scratch every time, until you</span>’<span>ve fully internalized the algorithm.</span></p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Level 3</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>One day, long after I</span>’<span>ve finished my university, I was a TA for an algorithms course. The lecturer</span>
<span>for the course was the person who originally taught me to program, through a similar algorithms</span>
<span>course. And, during one coffee break, he said something like</span></p>

<figure>
<blockquote><p><span>We don</span>’<span>t teach algorithms so that students can code Dijkstra with their eyes closed on the job.</span>
<span>They probably won</span>’<span>t have to code any fancy algorithms themselves.</span></p>
<p><span>We teach algorithms so that students learn to think about invariants and properties when writing</span>
<span>code. Real-life code is usually simple enough that it mostly works if you just throw spaghetti</span>
<span>onto the wall. But it doesn</span>’<span>t always work. To write correct, robust code at work, you need to</span>
<span>think about invariants.</span></p>
<p><span>The trick with algorithms is that coding them is hard. The only way to avoid bugs is to force</span>
<span>yourself to think in terms of invariants.</span></p>
</blockquote>

</figure>
<p><span>I was thunderstruck! I didn</span>’<span>t realize that</span>’<span>s the reason why I am learning (well, teaching at that</span>
<span>point) algorithms! Before, I always muddled through my algorithms by randomly tweaking generally</span>
<span>correct stuff until it works. E.g., with a binary search, just add </span><code>+1</code><span> somewhere until it doesn</span>’<span>t</span>
<span>loop on random arrays. After hearing this advice, I went home and wrote my millionth binary</span>
<span>search, but this time I actually added comments with loop invariants, and it worked from the first</span>
<span>try! I applied similar techniques for the rest of the course, and since then my subjective</span>
<span>perception of bug rate (for normal work code) went down dramatically.</span></p>
<p><span>So this is the third level of algorithms </span>—<span> you hone your coding skills to program without bugs.</span>
<span>If you are already fairly comfortable with algorithms, try doing CSES again. But this time, spend</span>
<span>however much you need double-checking the code </span><em><span>before</span></em><span> submission, but try to get everything</span>
<span>correct on the first try.</span></p>
</dd>

<section id="On-Algorithm-Names">

    <h3>
    <a href="#On-Algorithm-Names"><span>On Algorithm Names</span> </a>
    </h3>
<p><span>Here</span>’<span>s the list of things you might want to be able to do, algorithmically. You don</span>’<span>t need to be</span>
<span>able to code everything on the spot. I think it would help if you know what each word is about, and</span>
<span>have implemented the thing at least once in the past.</span></p>
<p><span>Linear search, binary search, quadratic sorting, quick sort, merge sort, heap sort, binary heap,</span>
<span>growable array (aka ArrayList, vector), doubly-linked list, binary search tree, avl tree, red-black</span>
<span>tree, B-tree, splay tree, hash table (chaining and open addressing), depth first search, breadth first</span>
<span>search, topological sort, strongly connected components, minimal spanning tree (Prim &amp; Kruskal),</span>
<span>shortest paths (bfs, Dijkstra, Floyd–Warshall, Bellman–Ford), substring search (quadratic,</span>

    <h3>
    <a href="#On-Larger-Programs"><span>On Larger Programs</span> </a>
    </h3>
<p><span>A very powerful exercise is coding a medium-sized project from scratch. Something that takes more</span>
<span>than a day, but less than a week, and has a meaningful architecture which can be just right, or</span>
<span>messed up. Here are some great projects to do:</span></p>
<dl>
<dt><span>Ray Tracer</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>Given an analytical description of a 3D scene, convert it to a colored 2D image, by simulating a</span>
<span>path of a ray of light as it bounces off objects.</span></p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Software Rasterizer</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>Given a description of a 3D scene as a set of triangles, convert it to a colored 2D image by</span>
<span>projecting triangles onto the viewing plane and drawing the projections in the correct order.</span></p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Dynamically Typed Programming Language</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>An </span><em><span>interpreter</span></em><span> which reads source code as text, parses it into an AST, and directly executes the</span>
<span>AST (or maybe converts AST to the byte code fore some speed up)</span></p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Statically Typed Programming Language</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>A </span><em><span>compiler</span></em><span> which reads source code as text, and spits out a binary (WASM would be a terrific</span>
<span>target).</span></p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Relational Database</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>Several components:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Storage engine, which stores data durably on disk and implements on-disk ordered data structures</span>
<span>(B-tree or LSM)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Relational data model which is implemented on top of primitive ordered data structures.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Relational language to express schema and queries.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Either a TCP server to accept transactions as a database server, or an API for embedding for an</span>
<span>in-processes </span>“<span>embedded</span>”<span> database.</span>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><span>Chat Server</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>An exercise in networking and asynchronous programming. Multiple client programs connect to a</span>
<span>server program. A client can send a message either to a specific different client, or to all other</span>
<span>clients (broadcast). There are many variations on how to implement this: blocking read/write</span>
<span>calls, </span><code>epoll</code><span>, </span><code>io_uring</code><span>, threads, callbacks, futures, manually-coded state machines.</span></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><span>Again, it</span>’<span>s more valuable to do the same exercise six times with variations, than to blast through</span>
<span>everything once.</span></p>

<p>Processor companies typically iterate off proven designs, and for good reason. Changing too many things at once introduces a lot of risk. A lot of changing parts makes it hard to get a good picture of overall performance, so it also makes tuning difficult. Pentium 4 and Bulldozer made clean breaks from prior architectures, and both were unsuccessful designs. But sometimes, making a clean break does pay off.</p>
<p>Sandy Bridge is one such case. It inherited architectural features from Intel’s prior P6 and Netburst architectures, but can’t be considered a member of either line. Unlike Netburst, Sandy Bridge was so successful that Intel’s high performance cores to this day can trace their lineage to back to it. In the early 2010s, Sandy Bridge was so successful that Intel went completely unchallenged in the high end CPU market. And as a testament to the architecture’s solid design, Sandy Bridge CPUs still deliver enough performance to remain usable across a range of everyday tasks.</p>
<h2>Block Diagram</h2>
<p>Sandy Bridge is a four-wide, out-of-order architecture with three ALU ports and two AGU ports. The same applies to prior generations from the P6 family. Core 2 (Merom) and the first generation Core i7/5/3 CPUs (Nehalem) were also four-wide, and have the same execution port count. But core width and execution resources are one thing, and feeding them is another. Sandy Bridge is far better at keeping itself fed, thanks to improvements throughout the pipeline and cache hierarchy.</p>

<h2>Frontend: Branch Prediction</h2>
<p>Branch prediction is vital to CPU performance, especially for out-of-order CPUs that can speculate far ahead of a branch. Sandy Bridge dramatically advances branch predictor performance compared to Nehalem, and can recognize much longer patterns. According to Microprocessor Report (MPR), Sandy Bridge does not use classic 2-bit counters for its history table. Instead, entries use 1-bit counters, with a “confidence” bit shared across multiple entries. Thus, Sandy Bridge was able to implement a larger history table with the same amount storage.</p>
<figure><p><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="17954" src="https://i0.wp.com/chipsandcheese.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snb_branchhist.png?ssl=1" alt="" width="1161" height="690" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/chipsandcheese.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snb_branchhist.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="17955" src="https://i1.wp.com/chipsandcheese.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/westmere_branchhist.png?ssl=1" alt="" width="1157" height="690" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/chipsandcheese.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/westmere_branchhist.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p></figure>
<p>A larger history table lets Sandy Bridge recognize longer patterns when there are a few difficult to predict branches, and avoid destructive aliasing when a lot of branches are in play. Intel made a large improvement in direction prediction, and that’s important because Sandy Bridge can speculate farther than Nehalem can.</p>
<h3>Branch Target Tracking</h3>
<p>Intel made similar optimizations to the branch target buffer (BTB), a structure that remembers where branches went so the branch predictor can steer the frontend with minimal delay. Instead of directly holding branch targets, Sandy Bridge stores branch offsets and adds those to the current program counter to calculate the branch target. Most branches jump short distances, so most BTB entries can be small. MPR further states that Nehalem’s BTB had 64 bit entries, which I find very unlikely. x86-64 virtual addresses are only 48 bits wide, and Nehalem uses 40-bit physical addressing. Using 64-bits to store a branch target would be an exercise in stupidity because the upper 16 bits would always be zero. Maybe 64 bits refers to the total size of the BTB entry, including tag and state bits.</p>
<p>Compared to Nehalem, Sandy Bridge doubles the BTB capacity from 2048 entries to 4096 entries. Intel accomplished this doubling of capacity with no penalty, which is quite an impressive feat. AMD’s Bulldozer increased BTB capacity from 2048 entries in K10 to 5120 entries, but had to do so by adding a slower BTB level.</p>

<p>Sandy Bridge’s main BTB has 2 cycles of latency. That matches Bulldozer’s 512 entry L1 BTB, and is much faster than Bulldozer’s 5 cycle L2 BTB. However, 2 cycle latency still means the frontend loses a cycle after a taken branch. To mitigate this, Sandy Bridge can handle up to eight branches with single cycle latency, possibly by using a very fast L0 BTB. AMD didn’t get similar capability until Zen released in 2017.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I was unable to reach full BTB capacity. However, Matt Godbolt has run extensive tests to <a href="https://xania.org/201602/haswell-and-ivy-btb">measure BTB capacity on Ivy Bridge</a> (the 22nm die shrink of Sandy Bridge), and concluded that the BTB has 4096 entries. Furthermore, he measured 2048 BTB entries on Nehalem. </p>
<h3>Return Stack</h3>
<p>Returns are used to exit from a function back to the calling code, and are quite common. They’re also easy to predict, because returns will almost always match up with a function call. CPUs take advantage of this by using a stack to predict returns. Sandy Bridge’s return stack has 16 entries, which should be adequate for most cases. Bulldozer has a larger 24 entry return stack. AMD can cope better with deeply nested function calls, though there’s probably diminishing returns to increasing return stack depth.</p>
<h3>Indirect Branch Prediction</h3>
<p>Returns are a special case of indirect branches, or branches that go to multiple targets. Predicting indirect branch destinations is quite a bit more difficult, but also important because they’re commonly used for method calls in object oriented languages. </p>

<p>Sandy Bridge’s indirect predictor can track up to 128 targets, achieved with 64 branches going to two targets each. For a single branch, the predictor can pick between up to 24 targets.</p>
<h2>Frontend: Fetch and Decode</h2>
<p>Once the branch predictor has determined where to go, the frontend has to bring instructions into the core. Sandy Bridge’s frontend inherits features from Nehalem, but gets a new 1536 entry, 8-way micro-op cache. The micro-op cache holds decoded instructions, allowing the core to skip the traditional fetch and decode path. In that sense, it’s similar to Netburst’s trace cache. Both architectures can deliver instructions with lower power and lower latency when feeding the pipeline from the micro-op or trace cache. But Sandy Bridge doesn’t try to cache traces. Rather, micro-op cache lines directly correspond to 32-byte aligned memory regions. Compared to Netburst, Sandy Bridge gets better caching efficiency, because Netburst’s trace cache might store the same instruction many times to improve fetch bandwidth around taken branches.</p>

<p>But Sandy Bridge’s micro-op cache is still optimized for high speed and low power, rather than caching efficiency. It’s virtually addressed, meaning that program addresses don’t have to be translated to do a micro-op cache lookup. To maintain consistency between virtual and physical addresses (i.e. handle cases where the OS changes mappings between virtual and physical addresses), the L1 instruction cache and instruction TLB (iTLB) are inclusive of the micro-op cache. An iTLB miss implies a micro-op cache miss, and iTLB evictions can flush the micro-op cache. On top of that, some instruction patterns can’t be filled into the micro-op cache:</p>

<p>Therefore, Sandy Bridge’s micro-op cache augments the traditional fetch and decode mechanism instead of replacing it. Because micro-op cache hitrate isn’t expected to be as good as with a traditional L1i cache, the micro-op cache is used in a way that minimizes penalties when code spills out of it. Intel only transitions to the micro-op cache after a branch, meaning the frontend isn’t constantly checking the micro-op cache tags and wasting power when hitrate may be low.</p>
<p>Compared to its primary competitors and prior Intel architectures, Sandy Bridge can achieve excellent performance with small instruction footprints but relatively long instruction lengths. Dense compute kernels come to mind here, because they’ll use longer AVX instructions executing in small loops.</p>

<p>Once code spills out of the micro-op cache, frontend throughput takes a sharp drop. However, the L1 instruction cache can still provide enough bandwidth if instructions are around 4 bytes. Integer code typically has average instruction lengths a bit below 4 bytes.</p>

<p>If code spills out of the L1i, instruction throughput takes a sharp drop. But while it’s a step behind modern chips, it compares well to its competition. Bulldozer struggles even more if it has to fetch code from L2, though the large L1i should reduce how often that happens.</p>

<p>In the end, Sandy Bridge has a very complex frontend compared to prior Intel architectures, or indeed anything else of its time. The core can incredibly feed its pipeline from four different sources. At first, that sounds like a non-intuitive and complex solution. But imitation and longevity are the sincerest forms of flattery for microarchitecture design. Today, ARM and AMD use similar frontend strategies in their high performance cores, which speaks to the strength of Sandy Bridge’s design.</p>
<h2>Rename and Allocate</h2>
<p>After instructions have been converted into micro-ops, backend resources have to be allocated to track them and enable out-of-order execution. This stage is called the renamer, because it performs register renaming to break false dependencies. It’s also a convenient place to pull more tricks that expose additional parallelism to the backend. For example, operations that always result in zero can be set to have no dependencies. Register to register copies can be eliminated by manipulating the register alias tables. Sandy Bridge recognizes zeroing idioms, but Intel was not able to implement move elimination. That would have to wait until Ivy Bridge.</p>
<h2>Execution Engine</h2>
<p>Sandy Bridge’s out-of-order execution engine is a fresh design. At a high level, it’s Netburst but bigger and less stupid. By that, I mean it uses a PRF based execution scheme where data values are stored in physical register flies, and pointers to register file entries get moved around instead of the values themselves. Contrast that with P6’s ROB based execution scheme, which stores register values in the ROB. When an instruction retires, P6 copies its result from the ROB to a retired register file. Apparently, P6 also stored input values in its scheduler. That may have simplified design because all the info needed to execute a micro-op can come from the scheduler, but bloats scheduler size.</p>

Early P6 generations only had to move up to 80-bit values</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>These inefficiencies were probably fine on early P6 variants, where the largest register values were 80-bits wide. Nehalem’s 128-bit SSE registers were pushing things a bit, but growing transistor budgets and process improvements let it get by. Sandy Bridge is a different story. 256-bit AVX registers are no joke, and Intel needed to move those giant values around as little as possible. By going to a PRF based scheme, Intel was able to provide a full width AVX implementation while also greatly increasing reordering capacity.</p>

<p>Intel’s PRF implementation has some quirks as well. Apparently, Sandy Bridge has a Physical Register Reclaim Table (PRRT) structure in addition to separate freelists for each register file. The PRRT is responsible for telling the retirement stage what register (if any) can be reclaimed when an instruction retires, but notably doesn’t have enough entries to cover the entire ROB. </p>

<p>Sandy Bridge can therefore have its reordering capacity limited by how many total registers it can allocate, even if the relevant register file has free entries. </p>
<h3>Execution Units</h3>
<p>Once the scheduler has determined that a micro-op is ready for execution, it’s sent to Sandy Bridge’s six execution ports. It’s easier to think of this as five ports (three for math, two for memory), because a sixth port is only used to handle stores. Stores on Intel CPUs use both an AGU port and a store data port, so the store data port doesn’t allow higher instruction throughput.</p>
<p>Execution units are generally well distributed across the ports, but there are weak points compared to newer CPUs. That especially applies for vector and floating point execution. If code has a lot of shuffle operations, port 5 can see heavy load because it has to handle all vector shuffles and branches.</p>

<p>Floating point workloads dominated by adds or multiplies (but not a roughly even mix of both) could see port bottlenecks on ports 1 and 0, respectively. That’s really only a disadvantage compared to more modern architectures, as prior generations of Intel CPUs had similar limitations.</p>
<h3>Memory Execution</h3>
<p>Operations that access memory are sent down Sandy Bridge’s two address generation pipelines. Prior Intel architectures had specialized AGU pipes, with one for loads and the other for stores. Sandy Bridge uses a more flexible setup where both pipes can handle either loads or stores. Loads tend to be far more common than stores, so Sandy Bridge should see far less contention on the AGU ports.</p>

<p>However, AGU throughput is still a stumbling block for Sandy Bridge. Per-cycle, the L1D can theoretically service three accesses, but the AGUs can only provide two addresses. In 2013, Intel’s Haswell introduced a triple AGU setup, letting it sustain 3 memory operations per cycle. AMD did the same in 2019 with Zen 2. It’s not a big deal but newer CPUs do better.</p>
<h3>Memory Disambiguation, and Load/Store Penalites</h3>
<p>After addresses are calculated, the load/store unit has to make sure memory dependencies are satisfied. Loads that overlap with earlier in-flight stores have to get their data forwarded, but checking for partial overlaps can be complicated. Nehalem had a very sophisticated comparison mechanism, and could handle all cases where the store is completely contained within a later load. The same applies to Sandy Bridge, but the check appears to be done in two stages. </p>

<p>First, Sandy Bridge does a quick check to see if accesses overlap the same 4 byte aligned region. It only does a more thorough check if there is an overlap. Successful store forwarding has a latency of 5-6 cycles, while partial overlap cases take 17-18 cycles, or 24-25 cycles if they cross a cacheline boundary. Store forwarding is a lot less sophisticated for vector accesses. Sandy Bridge can only forward the lower or upper half of a 128-bit store, and does so with a latency of 7-8 cycles.</p>
<h3>Address Translation and Paging</h3>
<p>All modern operating systems rely on virtual memory to keep misbehaving processes from tripping over each other or bringing down the entire system. Virtual memory requires virtual program-visible addresses to be translated to physical addresses. Sandy Bridge uses a two-level cache of address translations to speed this up. First, a 64 entry DTLB can provide translations without penalty. If the L1 DTLB is missed, Sandy Bridge can get the translation from a 1024 entry L2 TLB, with an additional 7 cycles of latency.</p>
<p>Address translations get messy if an access crosses a page boundary, because the underlying data might be very far apart in physical memory. On Sandy Bridge, a split-page load costs 36 cycles, while a split-page store costs 25 cycles. Forwarding doesn’t work across page boundaries, where you can see a 36 cycle penalty if the store spans pages. If both the load and store cross a page boundary, the penalty goes to 53 cycles. Modern CPUs improve on these penalties, but Sandy Bridge already turns in a far better performance than its AMD competition.</p>
<h2>Cache Performance</h2>
<p>Intel standardized on a triple-level caching setup starting with Nehalem. Sandy Bridge carries the high level caching scheme forward, but with important improvements. Starting at L1, the improved AGU setup gives Sandy Bridge twice as much load bandwidth as Nehalem. L2 bandwidth also improves, though it’s nowhere near the 32 bytes per cycle that Sandy Bridge should be theoretically capable of. </p>

<p>At L3, we see a slight bandwidth advantage for Sandy Bridge. The Xeon X5650 and E5-1650 both serve their cores with 12 MB of L3 cache arranged into six slices, but do so very differently. Westmere and Nehalem use a centralized Global Queue (GQ) in front of the L3 cache. All L3 request tracking can happen at the GQ so that approach is probably easier to implement and verify. But it’s not scalable.</p>

<p>Higher core counts mean more L3 and memory requests in flight, so the GQ needs more entries to cope. A larger GQ means more requests to scan when making decisions on request priority<sup>2</sup>. All of this has to be handled with low latency. The GQ is not ideal for that either, because every request has to go through the centralized queue in the middle of the chip, even if the L3 slice holding the relevant data is quite close to the requesting core.</p>
<p>Sandy Bridge ditches the GQ in favor of a divide-and-conquer approach. L3 lookup and request tracking functionality gets distributed across the L3 slices, which are connected via a ring bus. The request scheduler at each L3 slice can be smaller than the GQ, and can run at core clocks. In the end, the ring bus delivers massive bandwidth advantages:</p>

<p>Even under heavy load, the E5-1650 (Sandy Bridge) can provide more than 9 bytes per cycle of bandwidth to each of its six cores. Each of the X5650’s cores in contrast can only average 4.7 bytes per cycle. Sandy Bridge’s advantage extends past bandwidth. Latency improves because requests can take a more direct route to the destination slice, instead of always going through GQ in the center of the die. Simpler request arbiters probably help latency too.</p>

<p>In terms of core clocks, Sandy Bridge drops latency by about 7 cycles. That’s already a good improvement. But we can only capture the magnitude of Sandy Bridge’s progress when we look at actual latency. 10.3 ns is an excellent figure for a 12 MB cache. I really have to give it to Intel’s engineers here because they delivered a massive leap in L3 performance even when their prior design would have had no problems competing against AMD.</p>

<p>However, Sandy Bridge doesn’t improve latency across the board. L2 latency regresses by two cycles compared to Nehalem, though the E5-1650’s higher clock speed means actual latency is very similar. 12 cycle L2 latency is very acceptable in any case.</p>
<h2>Cache Coherency Performance</h2>
<p>L3 performance is an excellent way to measure Sandy Bridge’s interconnect performance, because L3 traffic makes up most of the traffic going across the ring bus. Another way to check interconnect performance is testing how long it takes to bounce data between pairs of cores.

The L3 keeps core valid bits alongside each line</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Sandy Bridge sees slightly varying core to core latencies, depending on how far cores are from the L3 slice that owns the cache slice. On Westmere and Nehalem, all requests flow through a centralized arbiter. Latencies are more uniform, and are uniformly higher. The E5-1650’s worst case is better than the X5650’s best case.</p>
<p>Alongside non-contested L3 performance, Sandy Bridge’s core-to-core latency performance demonstrates the excellence of its ring bus design. Again, imitation and longevity are the sincerest forms of flattery for CPU features. Today, Intel continues to use a ring bus in client CPUs, and AMD has done the same (starting with Zen 3).</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>Sandy Bridge is now more than a decade old, but Intel architectures today can still trace their origins to iterative changes built on top of Sandy Bridge’s base. As another compliment to Sandy Bridge, its concepts have shown up in successful architectures outside of Intel. AMD’s Zen line uses a micro-op cache and a distributed L3 design, though implementation details differ. Micro-op caches also appear on ARM’s latest high performance designs.</p>
<p>Today, Sandy Bridge remains surprisingly usable, even if more modern CPUs beat it into the ground in head-to-head benchmarking. That’s because it does the important things right. Its branch predictor performs well. Out-of-order buffers are well balanced, and the pipeline in general has few penalties. Caches have low latency and adequate bandwidth. Modern CPUs do better in most of those categories, but are often chasing diminishing returns. In short, there’s not a lot that Sandy Bridge did wrong.</p>
<p>When Sandy Bridge does fall short compared to modern CPUs, it’s generally in specific categories of applications. For example, its execution port count looks absolutely anemic compared to CPUs just a generation later. But feeding the execution resources is more important than having a lot of them, so having fewer ports isn’t a big deal. Sandy Bridge also isn’t as wide as newer CPUs, but again core width is not as important as feeding that width. </p>
<p>Most impressively, Intel made enormous strides without serious competition. A slightly improved Nehalem would have been enough to beat AMD’s Bulldozer. Instead, Intel created a fresh design that left AMD completely in the dust. Then, Intel made iterative improvements that kept the company well ahead of any competition. When looking back at Sandy Bridge and the years after its release, I can’t help but miss the old Intel. Intel in the early 2010s was bold and confident, introducing performance and power efficiency improvements on a steady pace. Today’s Intel barely keeps its footing against a resurgent AMD. That said, Intel has a tradition of learning from setbacks and coming back stronger. They recovered from the Pentium FDIV bug and grew to dominate the PC market. They recovered from the misstep of Netburst to deliver Core 2, and then used what they learned from both architecture lines to create Sandy Bridge. Hopefully, Intel will have another Sandy Bridge or Core 2 moment in the years to come.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dear client,</p>

<p>Setting aside the earlier challenges of using Zoom under ChromeOS and Linux, I have mostly been <strong>declining invitations to Zoom calls</strong> because of the terms they introduced from April 2023 in section 10 of their <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/terms/" rel="nofollow">Terms of Service</a> which seem to force every user, with no opt-out to the Terms available and with recourse only via arbitration, to agree that Zoom can:</p>
<ol><li>Train their AI on anything uploaded or created on Zoom (including transcripts and recordings) and use the consequent model for absolutely anything;</li>
<li>Have indefinite and ownership-equivalent rights to do so in the future and</li>
<li>Be indemnified by me if it turns out someone else owns the IP or has their rights infringed (for example to confidential materials everyone on the call is entitled to review).</li></ol>

<p>I prefer <a href="https://meet.jit.si/" rel="nofollow">Jitsi</a> instead; it has equivalent functionality, is platform independent, can be used without an account, is open source and can be self-hosted.</p>

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>

<p>In the <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/terms/" rel="nofollow">terms</a>, “data, content, files, documents, or other materials” that you use in a Zoom session (“Customer Input”), as well as recordings and transcripts, and any other glitter Zoom sprinkles over them, is called “Customer Content”.</p>

<p>10.4(ii) then sees you granting a broad license to Customer Content “for the purpose of product and service development, marketing, analytics, quality assurance, machine learning, artificial intelligence, training, testing, improvement of the Services, Software, or Zoom’s other products, services, and software, or any combination thereof”</p>

<p>If the stuff you shared belongs to someone else, 10.6 sees you agreeing “you are solely responsible for the Customer Content” and notably for getting consent from third parties and providing notices according to whatever laws happen to be applicable to the combination of people involved.</p>

<p>In addition to all this, in 10.6 you “represent and warrant that you have the right to upload Customer Input and for Zoom to provide, create, or make available any Customer Content to you, and that such use or provision by you, your End User, or Zoom does not violate or infringe any rights of any third party.” &nbsp;So according to 25(i) &amp; (iii) you are basically indemnifying them if they train their AI with someone else's IP you happen to have – for example, a client brief you are discussing internally, or a legal case you are working on under privilege.</p>

<p>There is no opt-out or scope control to use in the Terms for AI training. Zoom's COO <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37029700" rel="nofollow">says</a> the actual use of the AI features is opt-in, but that doesn't seem relevant as the Terms grant permission regardless and the Customer Content exists whether you use the AI features or not.</p>

<p>My non-lawyer read suggests this is an exceptionally risky thing for anyone to agree if they are in possession of IP or under NDA concerning someone else's secrets, and I will be avoiding Zoom (even if they revert the terms – can't take the chance on future changes like this).</p>

He is a survivor of bacterial meningitis, which caused him to have multiple amputation surgeries on his feet. He is a proud advocate for those with disabilities and addiction issues. He covers everything from the NFL and UFC to pizza-chucking and analysis of Tom Cruise's running ability.</ul></div></li></ul></div><p><b>RIGHT BEFORE HE HEAVED</b> the million-dollar shot, the one that would launch an era of sports contests and change his life forever, Don Calhoun took a long look at his shoes.</p><p>He was only out here standing on the floor of Chicago Stadium on April 14, 1993, 15 feet from <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1035/michael-jordan" target="_blank">Michael Jordan</a> and the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls" target="_blank">Bulls</a>, because of his shoes. "Those won't scuff the court," an arena worker said as she signed Calhoun up for a $1 million, three-quarter-court contest shot that the Bulls had been running every night.</p><p>As he stared at his feet, waiting to be told it was his turn to take the shot, he was warned, "Whatever you do, don't step over the free throw line." Calhoun, a 23-year-old office supply salesman from the Chicago area, darted his eyes from his non-scuffing sneakers to the free throw line about 80 feet from the hoop he needed to make.</p><p>The impossibility of the shot was settling in. He wasn't going to be able to shoot it with both hands; he'd have to throw it like a quarterback. The Bulls had held the promotion 19 times that year already. Two people clunked the backboard. Another clanged the rim. The other 16 were air balls. Nobody came close. The best estimate of someone like Calhoun making that shot? Less than 1%.</p><p>But then, a calm came over him. He thought about his brother Clarence, who had told him five years earlier, just before he died, that Michael Jordan would soon be the best player in the NBA and the Bulls would be a dynasty. He thought about his bittersweet feelings toward the sport of basketball -- he loved the game and was good at it, but he never made his high school team.</p><p>It might sound ridiculous, but as Calhoun stood there and heard his name announced, he became sure -- <i>100% certain</i> -- that the shot was going to go in. The last thing he remembers is the steady hum of 18,600 people rising to cheer for him. As the Bulls huddled up nearby, Calhoun palmed the ball in one hand. The free throw line warning was bouncing around inside his head, and for a second, he felt his flow get disrupted.</p><p>But the flow came back as he stepped past the end line. He took one fast dribble, thought to himself, "This is for Clarence," and then threw a high-arching rocket.</p><p>As the ball sailed toward the hoop, Calhoun's eyes again turned toward his feet and he saw that he was <i>very</i> close to the free throw line -- but a few inches behind. Whew. When he looked up again, he had a moment of panic. He'd thrown it too far and too hard.</p><p>"It looked like it was going to hit the shot clock," he says.</p><p>But then the ball began to sink. It dropped, and dropped, and dropped, and... <i>swish</i>. Right through the net. Calhoun threw his arms toward the rafters, and the crowd let out one of those levels of cheers that aggravates the arena neighbors.</p><p>Then the real mayhem began.</p><p>The ensuing 30 seconds might be the most joyous footage of that Bulls team ever. Seriously, watch the most celebratory moments from "The Last Dance," and compare those with the clips you will inevitably see this April 14 on social media on the 30th anniversary of Calhoun's heave. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3815/john-paxson" target="_blank">John Paxson</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/919/scott-williams" target="_blank">Scott Williams</a> go wild. Some player just off-camera slaps Calhoun's ass over and over again, and even one of the game refs comes over, hits him on the back and hands him the ball from the shot. Phil Jackson stands there with an incredulous grin, looking like he just won the $1 million.</p><p>Suddenly, Calhoun found himself bumped and butt-slapped directly into the middle of the Bulls huddle, where the other players parted and there stood <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/663/scottie-pippen" target="_blank">Scottie Pippen</a> and Michael Jordan. Calhoun was the team's 13th man at that moment. Calhoun was in there for a good 10 seconds when he felt Jordan slap him on the back and lean into his ear.</p><p>"Great shot, kid," Jordan said.</p><p>Calhoun says he can still hear the way Jordan was yelling "Woo!" behind him the entire time. After the game, Michael Wilbon, then at The Washington Post, wrote, "Jordan, smiling in a child-like way I've never seen on the court, threw both arms around his neck and squeezed." As the celebration exploded around him, Calhoun felt as if his life was going to change. He was the toast of Chicago for the next 24 hours, with the shot going viral by 1993 standards, with newscasts and newspapers all showing the clip so much that Calhoun's shot is now referenced as the beginning of a boom in contests at sporting events. And best of all, Calhoun was about to become a millionaire.</p><p>Or so he thought.</p><hr><p><b>BY THE TIME DON CALHOUN</b> made his shot, in-game contests had begun to pop up here and there across the country. But Calhoun's make caused an eruption in popularity. Chris Hamman, VP at industry leader SCA Promotions, thinks "The Calhoun Shot," as it's become known in the business, might have doubled or even tripled the number of contests.</p><p>"These types of contests grew quite a bit, and a lot of NBA teams started doing similar contests," says Hamman, whose dad, Bob, founded SCA Promotions, which has been insuring sports contests since the mid-1980s. Chris compares Calhoun's make with the impact Chris Moneymaker had on poker in 2003 when he went from an $86 online qualifier to winning the World Series of Poker (and $2.5 million).</p><p>The contests took off afterward. They were the perfect way to keep 15,000-plus people engaged during TV timeouts and between quarters. They were wildly popular crowd-pleasers back then, and remain slam dunk #ViralContent in the social media era. SCA Promotions has insured billions of dollars of sports contests since the mid-1980s, paying out something like $250 million in winnings over the years, according to Bob Hamman. (SCA was not the insurer of the Calhoun Shot).</p><p>As the Hammans note, the perfect contest is like the most tempting carnival game: just feasible enough to make people think they can do it while actually being extremely difficult. Everybody at the Bulls game that night in 1993 probably had sunk a long shot or two at some point in their life. In reality, Jordan himself might not have made one if you gave him 100 tries. "With the shot that Don Calhoun made, you could have <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry" target="_blank">Steph Curry</a> out there and still make money," Chris Hamman says.</p><p>But, as was the case with Calhoun, people do win enough to keep contest dreams alive. SCA Promotions insures more than $100 million in sports contests every year, and the Hammans love telling stories of paying off winners ... because the vast majority of holes-in-one and half-court shots never happen. It's a little like when sportsbooks leak out those betting slips of the fan who hit a 12-team parlay that cost $40 and pays out $250,000. The good news fuels the delusion of it happening to you.</p><p>One of the Hammans' favorite winners was a <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/ari/arizona-diamondbacks" target="_blank">Diamondbacks</a> fan, Gylene Hoyle, who won a 1999 radio contest where she had to pick one Arizona player and an inning. If that player hit a home run in that exact inning during a specific game, she'd win $1 million.</p><p>Seems doable, right? The math is actually obscene. She picked <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/1823/jay-bell" target="_blank">Jay Bell</a>, who was in the middle of a monster year (38 home runs and 112 RBIs). She had about a 1-in-2,916 chance. And yet, Bell came to the plate in the sixth inning with the bases loaded. He fouled off two straight two-strike pitches, then hit a home run on a pitch that could have been ball four. Afterward, he acknowledged that he knew about the contest and swung hoping to get someone $1 million. "That one stung," Bob Hamman says.</p><p>The math on insuring high-stakes contests generally works the same way. Brokers come up with a likelihood that a random contestant could win -- the Hammans say a three-quarter-court shot is less than 1%, for example -- and divide it into the prize amount, then charge about twice that to insure it. For a $1 million contest with a 1% success rate, that means it'd cost the team $20,000 every time they run it.</p><p>Once the details are ironed out, insurance companies come up with all the fine print. Contestants usually must be randomly selected from the crowd. If it's one shot, there's no warmup toss or second attempt. If it's three makes in 30 seconds, three makes in 30.1 seconds is close but no money. For something like a hockey shot that must go through a tiny plywood cutout and into a goal, the shot has to be entirely through. Not mostly through. Not on the line. <i>Entirely</i> through.</p><p>Insurance companies are unforgiving with teams that don't explain the rules right, and it's not unusual for franchises to end up paying out the contest themselves if there are any issues. The PR hit of stiffing a middle school geometry teacher out of $25,000 generally isn't worth it.</p><p>But lawsuits and disagreements happen, and that's what almost happened to Don Calhoun. One key stipulation in most insurance policies is that the contestant can't have played an "organized" version of the sport in question for a certain time period before the contest -- usually, five years.</p><p>Calhoun grew up in Chicago playing hoops on the playground with Clarence. Both had trouble making it onto junior high and varsity teams despite what seemed to be a worthy skill set. They were tough guards who loved dogging opposing ball handlers on defense. But they also played a brand of streetball that didn't always translate well to high school hoops.</p><p>They certainly had talent, though. Clarence graduated and played at a junior college for his freshman year, then transferred to <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/305/depaul-blue-demons" target="_blank">DePaul</a> to walk onto the basketball team as a sophomore. Don, then a senior in high school, drew inspiration from Clarence's unwillingness to quit basketball despite a high school career that didn't pan out -- he, too, planned to go to a small school to play hoops before transferring to a bigger school.</p><p>But one weekend, Clarence was on his way home from school to hang out with his family for a few days when the Calhouns got a dreaded phone call. He had gotten tired on the drive home, pulled over to rest, and been struck and killed by another car. He was 20.</p><p>Don was devastated. He didn't graduate that spring on time as he grieved. But he went back to school in the fall and got his diploma. He slowly landed in a headspace where he wanted to use his brother's memory as fuel. He bounced around at two community colleges and walked on with both basketball teams. One newspaper account from the time says he was 3-for-12 shooting in 11 career games.</p><p>But Don eventually walked away from school and from any formal basketball. He found out his longtime girlfriend was pregnant, so he got a job as an office supply salesman. Binders, notebooks, day planners, you name it, Don Calhoun was the guy to talk to. He was making a decent living, and he eventually had a son. The little boy's name? Clarence Calhoun II.</p><p>When Clarence was 3, Don hugged him and told him to watch the Bulls game that night because Dad might be on TV. Clarence remembers his mom letting him stay up, although he's not sure he saw the actual shot. He just recalls yelling and pointing at the screen as he watched his dad leap up and down with Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. Then he went to bed.</p><p>Calhoun says that he marked on the forms that he had played some college basketball three years earlier and that the contest people shrugged about it. The insurance company disagreed, and the weekend after he had won, local news media began to report that Calhoun might not be getting the money. That prompted the Bulls to hold a news conference, where Calhoun sat beside Jerry Reinsdorf and several contest sponsors.</p><p>"It is unclear at this time whether the company that insured the event will pay on the policy," a joint statement read. "However, regardless of its decision, [restaurant group] Lettuce Entertain You, Coca-Cola (Foundation) and the Chicago Bulls will honor the $1 million award and ensure that this event has a happy ending."</p><p>Calhoun left that day knowing that the win was, in fact, going to be a win. He would immediately receive his first of 20 annual $50,000 payments. In the coming weeks, he appeared on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" and got a cup of coffee as a member of the Harlem Globetrotters. He was, unbelievably, the unofficial mayor of Chicago for a brief period. When Wilbon called Calhoun's company for his story, someone answered by saying, "Reliable Office Superstore. This is the home of one-shot Don Calhoun, the million-dollar man."</p><p>He never got many details about how the sponsors and insurance company worked it out. He just took yes as an answer. It wasn't until a few weeks later that he found out that he might have needed a key assist from a secret source: Michael Jordan himself.</p><hr><p><b>AFTER CALHOUN</b> made the shot, he was asked to stay on the floor and do an endless string of TV hits and print interviews. As he bounced from camera setup to camera setup near the Chicago locker room, Bulls players kept leaving and spotting him on their way out. Almost every player came over, said congratulations and signed his basketball. "It took me three years to make a million dollars, and it took him five seconds," <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/279/horace-grant" target="_blank">Horace Grant</a> joked afterward.</p><p>Calhoun got signatures from Grant, Scottie Pippen, John Paxson and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/23" target="_blank">B.J. Armstrong</a>, plus two Heat players who swung by, Rony Seikaly and Steve Smith. And then, as he got ready to do another live hit, Calhoun saw Jordan and a Bulls staffer come out and stand nearby. Calhoun made eye contact with Jordan, who smiled back at him and was clearly there waiting to say hello to him. Calhoun wanted to run over and ditch whatever TV interview he was about to do, but producers kept telling him they were about to go live any second now.</p><p>When the lights went on, Calhoun did the best interview he could as he watched in dismay what was happening on the other side of the camera. Jordan said something to the Bulls staffer and left. Calhoun wasn't going to meet MJ, after all, and it crushed him. The Bulls worker said he could leave the ball behind and they'd try to get Jordan to sign it.</p><p>But Calhoun had other plans. He didn't want to leave the building without that ball, so he took it. He thought there was a chance he might run into Jordan somewhere down the road, then he could get an autograph.</p><p>Over the next few days, news broke all over the country that Calhoun's winnings seemed to be in jeopardy. Calhoun clung to that ball, and it provided him hope. He had made the shot. The crowd had gone completely wild. The Bulls had pulled him into their huddle. He had left with the ball. That was all real, and he would have it forever. The $1 million? He sure hoped it was coming his way. But he also felt an odd peace about the money. The experience alone certainly wouldn't pay for Clarence's school clothes. But it wasn't nothing, either. It was priceless.</p><p>As reports swirled, fan outrage was palpable in Chicago, which created enough heat on the franchise to figure out some way to pay the local office supply salesman his damn money. That led to the news conference and the first $50,000 check.</p><p>But what to do about his beloved basketball? The next school year, he had heard from a friend that Jordan always attended one of his kid's home games at a specific school in the area. So he showed up that night -- with his ball and two magazines -- and tried to walk up to Jordan. The Bulls star had his own section away from the crowd, complete with security that kept people from doing exactly what Calhoun was trying to do.</p><p>Calhoun was stopped on his approach by a Jordan security guy, who said Jordan had a firm policy of no autographs at his kids' events. Calhoun explained who he was and that Jordan had seemed to really want to meet him back in April. The security guy wouldn't budge. "No autographs at his kids' stuff," the guy repeated.</p><p>But Calhoun had a funny feeling that he shouldn't give up. He asked the security to <i>pretty-pretty-pretty please</i> tell Jordan that the guy who made The Calhoun Shot had come to the game hoping for his signature. The security guy shook his head. Calhoun was even willing to just hand the guy the ball to take to Jordan. No luck.</p><p>"Michael doesn't do anything when he's at one of his kid's games," Calhoun was told.</p><p>An unlikely thing happened near the end of the game, though. The security guard came to Calhoun in the stands and told him he could walk with Jordan to his car after the game. So Calhoun got his ball and Sharpie ready, then met up with the Jordan crew as he left the high school.</p><p>The first thing out of Jordan's mouth? "Did you get your money?" Jordan asked.</p><p>Calhoun said yes, and Jordan told him something that caught him off guard. "We made them give it to you," Jordan said. "We were upset that they were trying to not pay you."</p><p>Calhoun was stunned. He had heard rumors that the Bulls players were agitated at the thought of him getting stiffed. But this was confirmation that Michael Jordan himself helped make him a millionaire. (Jordan declined an interview request for this story; the Bulls also passed on participating.)</p><p>As they got to a set of doors, Calhoun knew Jordan's car was waiting for him on the other side. He asked whether Jordan would sign his ball, and MJ said no, that he had to stick to his principle of no autographs at his kids' stuff. "Bring it down to my steakhouse and drop it off, then I'll sign it," he said.</p><p>Calhoun waved goodbye that night and thanked Jordan once more for advocating on his behalf. But as he left later, he felt a pang as he considered just pulling up to Jordan's restaurant, dropping off the ball and hoping for the best.</p><p>The ball had grown to mean so much to him. It wasn't the signatures, or that he thought the ball might be worth something like $20,000. Its actual worth was beyond what someone could pay. It represented the agony of losing Clarence and trying to carry his brother's message with his own son. It represented the end of the bitter, unfulfilled taste that "organized" basketball had left in his mouth. It represented closing that chapter of his life when he had to fight and claw to pay every bill for his family, opening up 20 years where he knew he had a financial backstop each year.</p><p>Was he really going to hand the ball to some random steakhouse assistant manager and cross his fingers, hoping he'd see it again?</p><p>The answer was... yes, he was going to do exactly that. He felt as if Jordan's signature was too important as the coda to the story of the ball. So he drove over there one day and implored the person he handed it to for help, saying that this ball meant so much to him, that MJ's signature was the last missing component of an artifact from the most important moment of his life.</p><p>It must have worked. A few weeks later, he got a call to pick up the ball. "Michael signed it, and he wishes you well," Calhoun was told.</p><p>The ball became a family heirloom over the next three decades. But not in the way you'd expect. Calhoun never locked it up in a vault or even put it in a protective case in the house. He left it in the basement of his house, and Clarence and Calhoun's other three kids would dribble it and throw it around. He wanted his kids to be able to touch and feel something that had altered the trajectory of their family. "I'll always keep it for you," Don told Clarence.</p><p>For the next 20 years, Calhoun would get a check for $50,000 every year. Of that money, he'd have to set aside around $12,000 for taxes. He kept his office sales job for a few more years, and the other $38,000 (about $79,000 in 2023 dollars) was a very nice supplemental living. But, as Calhoun says, it was more like a bump up within the middle class. "In reality, you're not rich," he says. "You're not a millionaire."</p><p>Maybe he didn't have generational wealth. But he was about to experience a generational breakthrough.</p><hr><p><b>AS THE 30th ANNIVERSARY</b> of the shot approaches, Calhoun takes a few weeks to decide whether he will talk about the shot, the money or any of it. He hasn't done many interviews over the years. Eventually, he agreed to one but asked that his current location and occupation be left out of the story. Let's say he's living within a few hours of Chicago in the Midwest, and he works the second shift at a solid job.</p><p>He's not hesitant because he's a particularly shy person -- once he gets rolling on the phone, he's funny and unafraid to argue, and he comes off as very open and honest as he talks. Toward the end of an hourlong interview, he asks, "How can I get to the Hall of Fame?"</p><p>When the answer is a surprised chuckle, he says, "Don't you laugh. I want to be in the Hall of Fame. I think I deserve it."</p><p>He seems to be goofing around, but Calhoun changes lanes easily between being confident and reserved. He talks about the shot like he knew it was going in the entire time, yet it never sounds particularly braggy. He seems as if he had his 15 minutes and is content with that ... but also thinks it'd be nice to have a small shrine to it.</p><p>Calhoun is 53 now. He catches the video only every few years, when somebody will show him a tweet or video link to a clip that you will most likely see every April 14 for the rest of eternity.</p><p>Calhoun is neither rich nor poor, at least in the traditional sense of the word. He does, however, feel wealthy when he talks about his four kids. The Calhoun Shot gave them all a better life. His youngest, Terrelle, is 20 and lives in Austin, Texas. Naomi, 22, is in nursing school. Gabriela, 28, is a teacher. And Clarence II, 33, is living out something beyond his own wildest dreams -- and his dad's.</p><p>Don Calhoun's oldest son became a good prep basketball player at East Aurora High School and graduated in 2008. With five years of $50,000 checks left, Don encouraged Clarence to finish the job he and his brother had started years earlier: graduating from college. Clarence loved that idea. What a cool way to pay tribute to the uncle he never met but was named after. The problem was, he still didn't know what he wanted to be when he grew up.</p><p>For the first few years after high school, he bounced between community colleges before getting into Wiley College, an HBCU in Marshall, Texas. He had developed an interest in the human body, especially biology. But college was no joke. Clarence Calhoun II limped to a 1.6 GPA in his first semester. It wasn't that he couldn't handle the coursework or the social life or the amount of work it took. It was the totality of doing all of those things all at once. He didn't know a single person who had experience at this level of education. He was a rookie, surrounded by rookies.</p><p>That's when he met a Ukrainian physician named Dr. Valentyn Siniak. Siniak was at Wiley teaching while he took mandatory tests to begin practicing medicine in the U.S. Calhoun was blown away by the level of support Siniak provided. Calhoun isn't sure exactly what Siniak saw in him, but he saw something.</p><p>In emails to Calhoun, Siniak began calling him "Dr. Clarence Calhoun." When Calhoun asked him for guidance on how he could get his grades up, Siniak made him laugh out loud. "I think you should start tutoring other students," Siniak said.</p><p>"Tutoring?" Calhoun said. "I'm struggling to learn everything myself. How can I teach others?" Siniak thought this would give Calhoun an extra nudge to learn the material and boost his own command.</p><p>Siniak was <i>exactly</i> right. So right, in fact, that Calhoun sighs and shakes his head on a Zoom describing this section of his life. He still can't fathom the way Siniak manifested belief into Calhoun's life. His grades soared, and he liked working with other students. He had to work his ass off to get there -- at one point, campus security officers would close up the science building for the night, knowing Calhoun was still in there. He'd study most of the night, inflate a mattress for a few hours and wake up the next day ready to do it again. "I found out I was smarter than I thought I was," Calhoun says now.</p><p>And so in 2013, Calhoun graduated from college just as his dad's $50,000 annual checks ended. He was the first in his family to get a college degree, and he battled and scrapped every day to get it.</p><p>He also had found out that his girlfriend was pregnant and that they were having a boy. When he told Don, he said, "Know what we're going to name him, Dad?"</p><p>Don began to think about it for a second ... and then it hit him. He didn't say a word, and his son didn't either. They laughed, hugged and celebrated the upcoming birth of Clarence Calhoun III.</p><p>Clarence Calhoun II started to chart a course for the next phase of his life, which had come into focus for him. "I want to be a doctor," he told his dad, and he began to try to get into medical school. He worked jobs at Jiffy Lube, a toxicology lab and other places before he finally passed his labs and got accepted. This was happening. Not only was a Calhoun going to earn his degree but he felt as if he might actually become the Dr. Clarence Calhoun his instructor, Dr. Siniak, had predicted in his emails.</p><p>That's why it breaks the younger Calhoun's heart to tell this next part of the story. Siniak didn't get to see Calhoun get his degree. In January 2013, Siniak was struck and killed while riding a motorcycle in Texas. "Having him believe in me helped me believe in myself," Calhoun says. "My biggest downfall that was keeping me from excelling was my confidence. I just didn't think I could. I didn't have anybody around me who had done it."</p><p>Over the next eight years, he passed his boards and did his residency, and an envelope arrived in May 2021 that he couldn't wait to open. The piece of paper inside made it official: He was now Dr. Clarence Calhoun.</p><p>He went to his dad's house to show him in person, and they had a long embrace. Don couldn't stop smiling. After a minute, he walked out of the room and came back holding two things he was giving to his son.</p><p>One was the shoes he had worn during The Calhoun Shot. Clarence noticed they had a signature on them. They were autographed by ... none other than Don Calhoun, which makes Clarence laugh to this day when he holds them up. His dad can be a goofball -- an inspiring goofball. "He drops spiritual motivation all the time, and that's always needed," Clarence says. "In moments when it feels like life is too difficult, he helps you figure out how you can do it."</p><p>For the second item, Don Calhoun didn't hand it to him. He reared back and threw a push pass at his son's chest.</p><p>"Here, I want you to have this," and he chucked an old basketball at his son. Clarence Calhoun II hadn't seen the ball from The Calhoun Shot in 10-15 years, and now it was going to live with him and his son. The two older Calhouns, Don and Clarence, hugged once more. And as Dr. Clarence Calhoun left that day, with a basketball under one arm and some old shoes under the other, his whole life felt like sinking a less than 1% three-quarter-court shot.</p>

I can give a feedback on our collaboration so far:<p>1) Code quality is good, I would compare it to a very good junior engineer (I suspect some senior engineers are reviewing the code before shipping it!). We are reviewing all PRs and it usually takes 1 or 2 round of feedbacks before merge.</p><p>2) Gitstart developers are very reactive on pull-requests, their response time is not a bottleneck</p><p>3) You will need to be very accurate about your features. I think Gitstart direclty makes sense for open-source projects as this is part of the culture to discuss everything on issues, to share resources (figmas, specs, technical vision). If your company already has a culture of documenting most of the knowledge async, this should be a good fit.

We run an open source project with a very long backlog and I came across Gitstart as I was looking for ways to accelerate development. We started working with them recently and overall I'm very happy with the service. At first the quality of PRs wasn't great, but it is still better than the average open source contribution, and it's improving everyday as they gain knowledge of our codebase and expectations.
As a remote team that is just starting a new project, it would have been hard for us to onboard and train a junior developer today. Using Gitstart fills a gap for tasks that we can easily delegate, typically something that's already done in a similar way in the code base. That way our team can focus on more challenging problems.<p>(Note: I was not asked to post this)

When you submit a PR, submit a process with it (in a readme of some sort) with instructions on how the receiving devs should proceed with the PR. If they are not happy with it, maybe they can just say "not happy with it" and you take on yourself to figure out why. That sort of instructions. The last thing you want is them complaining they spend more time on it than simply coding it.</p><p>Im pretty sure the management of the human interface here is key because the only way this can work is if you've got off-the-charts feedbacks. You need processes for that (you probably do already).

Everyone has been Jim at-least once before.<p>You are right, it will never replace good old Jim (or a backend dev).

Basically utilize GitStart as a way to accelerate on tickets that may not be worth his time, but accelerate everyone else.</p><p>On a go to market comment, we are laser focused first to target frontend teams, particularly where as long as you have API docs (Swagger, GraphQL), and a staging environment (or we help create one) devs can go a long way without shared context.

We have this problem too at Ritza (a technical writing agency), where often our customers have a mono-repo with a docs/ subfolder that we need access too. Currently we solve this with some custom bash scripts and cron to sync just a subfolder to an internal copy, but is far from perfect and still involves some manual cherry-picking.

Here in the UK it is illegal to hire an apprentice without at least paying them a minimum wage. The reason is that before the change, the apprenticeships were snapped up by people from wealthy background who could afford to work for "experience" or "exposure". This created a bubble, where at certain jobs you wouldn't see anyone from disadvantaged background working there, because those people had to take on jobs that weren't aligned with their interests, simply because they were poor and couldn't afford an apprenticeship.
Now, the minimum wage thing is still not ideal, because in certain areas that's not enough, especially where you have a large family to support, but it is better than nothing.

Is that cheating?). However!</p><p>First tiny backstory: Around 5 years ago I had a Clevo shitbox laptop for gaming (all I could afford then). It was loud and overheated (obviously). It was back in the "desktop replacement" days when there was a weird trend craze of putting desktop GPUs and CPUs into huge laptops, at the peril of...everyone?</p><p>So after a few months of having it, I decided to integrate an AIO water cooler "onto" (into?) it.</p><p>From a Youtube videos I learned the ins-and-outs of molex, lapping copper (how to not breath in ultra toxic metal dust was a welcome bonus), 12V and 24V switching power supplies, soldering, wire stripping, etc., then I just stuck the AIO cooler on with thermal adhesive, hooked it all up with a nice rocker switch and electric wizbangs, and I had a cute little switchable AIO cooler for my gaming laptop.</p><p>It looked gross, but actually resulted in a ~10% gaming perf boost and made it a lot more quiet (the AIO was taking a tonne of heat from the CPU where most of the heat and gaming bottlenecks came from.</p><p>It really did look hilarious. It was a fun story when guests came round for food/drinks/whatever; I would often get asked about what the heck it even is, as it just looked like some kid hot-glue-gunned a bunch of random wires, fans, and boxes to the back and under-side of a laptop.

Two years ago our basement flooded a week after we bought the house. I ended up tearing out the now-saturated carpet and put in vinyl plank flooring. Mainly straight forward but requires planning and at some points tricky sawing. It's cool when people come in and un-prompted say "wow that's a great floor you have here"</p><p>2. Maybe 4 years ago, I completely disassembled and repaired a through-wall heating and cooling unit in our NYC apartment because it wasn't producing a lot of air. Previously, repairmen came out and said it was working as normal and just wasn't meant to produce more air. This taught me a lot about electronics, HVAC, testing, and shopping at vendor-supply stores. People are shocked that a civilian was able to do this repair.</p><p>EDIT: I'll add one more:</p><p>3. Replacing the screen on my Pixel 6 Pro. It fell out of my pocket while biking, and although it wouldn't have been the end of the world to just get a replacement, I thought it would be fun to try and repair. I normally stayed away from stuff like that because I didn't want to deal with removing/applying adhesives but it was really not a big dea.

Re-plumbing a couple sinks and replacing a garbage disposal and/or adding a dishwasher is not hard to do, the building codes aren't terribly overbearing and its like Lego connecting things together with immediate feedback loop when testing for leaks (modern PVC plumbing, not older copper/metal).<p>When you own a home and have the time, there are some tasks that will save you a bunch because they are labor intensive but material costs are low. Also if you live in an area where people hire everything out you'll find shortages of contractors and high prices.

I think I ruled that out pretty quickly because one of the symptoms was icing on the evaporator side - so I figured the compressor side was producing enough cool.<p>At the end of the day the problem was the evaporator blower motor. It was insidious because it certainly worked and moved air around, but it was something like a 3 speed motor and the 2nd speed was failing and not moving enough air around, hence the icing and not producing enough air, something like that.

I suspect repair-folks don't do a lot of returns. EG - if they buy a capacitor and then it's not what was wrong, they end up keeping it for another job whereas I retired it. Also, when I bought the motor that was the manufacturer specified replacement, it wasn't a perfect match for some other part of the unit. I had to bike back to the store and the guy gave me some bushings (which solved the issue) but real repair people would probably know that the shaft thickness changed on that motor and carry some bushings around anyway.</p><p>So yeah they were fine to do business with me but they normally deal with large-size orders probably, so my stuff was "cute" but most certainly not a priority for them.

There are a lot of kit manufacturers out there, offering a wide range of aircraft styles and purposes from back-country to aerobatic to long-range cruise airplanes and more. Materials can include aluminum, fiberglass, wood-and-fabric, and others. The EAA[1] has a lot of information about the various kits. I went with a Vans[2] which are very popular kits with a huge volunteer support/help community online and offline. They list kit prices on their web site, but they are <i>exclusive</i> of engine, propeller and avionics, which can be significant. Fortunately, since it takes a looong time to build, these costs can be spread out over many years to make it manageable. I got my pilot certificate 20 years ago when it wasn't as expensive as today.

In many cases I've had to make my own pigment (For example I ground up Kingsford Charcoal for black pigment on "Untitled 7" which gave it more of a concrete texture)</p><p>The biggest challenge however is with pigments - not only are they hard to make and expensive to buy - but when mixing with lime plaster they get IMMEDIATELY washed out so that bright and bold colors are extremely hard to make.</p><p>I am currently working on my latest piece and this thread made me upload my latest progress to show: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CvptIU1urzD/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.instagram.com/p/CvptIU1urzD/</a></p><p>In order to get the depth of pigment I want I am experimenting with soaking my unset plaster with tons of pigmented water. So far it's working!</p><p>My next set of experiments is to figure out a new frame material that will not decompose faster than the plaster. My fear is that in a 100 years the wood will have degraded and that will cause the whole thing to fall apart, so I need to figure out how to get the plaster to adhere to stone somehow.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kemendoart/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.instagram.com/kemendoart/</a>

Though, with the housing market being as it is the timing was super favourable for me financially. It's also kind of neat to live in a turn of the century house with all sorts of modern amenities like radiant heating, thick insulation and HRE balanced ventilation.

Fast deployment was important to avoid radiation and guaranteing coverage was important for safety. Ended up costing significantly less than automated scanning using a robotic system.<p>My absolute favorite was using the data to project a 3d model of the interior of the welds.

The system used traditional manual scanning system with a VGA capture card on the back. I synced that with an off the shelf IR capture system and was able to record the ultrasonic scan into a video file using opencv. I would also record a USB cam at the same time as a sanity check. I could generate point clouds of data by reading the video file and the synced position data to project where the ultrasound was going and the linear response of the scanner. Was a ton of fun to develop and it was nice that I pretty much only had myself to blame when things went wrong. I also had to write the procedure for operation in case someone else had to use it.

We had an actual wedding photographer there too, and they got plenty of wonderful photos, but mostly of the wedding party. It's only been a few years since my wedding, but unfortunately, some older guests are no longer with us, and the photobooth has left us with some wonderful photos to remember them by, which otherwise I don't think we'd have.</p><p>Very DIY, bit in my rather biased option, very cool.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ONFa9AU.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://i.imgur.com/ONFa9AU.jpg</a> (the photobooth in action)</p><p>[2] <a href="https://i.imgur.com/DcldyHV.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://i.imgur.com/DcldyHV.jpg</a> (my wife and I taken using photobooth - we still have the damn ring of ivy floating round the house!)

We are going to release a new version of the bulb in coming months that fix all the issues of the previous product, as well as introduce some new features we think will move the lighting space forward. And we are combining our vision and additional feature requests to release even more advanced products.</p><p>[0] <a href="https://bedtimebulb.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://bedtimebulb.com</a>

Great experience, really helped me understand what is behind the walls of my future homes.<p>I'd say my son, but really my wife is the one that built him ;)

It sounds amazing for such a simple circuit and is actually an object I enjoy using as opposed to a toy like the FM transmitter was.

Next is to install dual 400W solar panel systems (it could have been a single 800W system, but it was actually cheaper with a dual 400W system).<p>Ultimately I'm going to live in this RV and work remotely as I travel.

Will it start back up? This was 12hrs into the event, so I was super tired.</p><p>The answer was surprisingly yes, and we fixed the cooling system for the next stage, but it broke halfway and eventually the freeze plugs blew out and we stopped due to concerns of hot steam coming into the cabin.</p><p>It drove off the trailer the next day! Headgasket blew across every cylinder.</p><p>New head and we entered in HDT. It did okay, but then the rear suspension fell out (!) On the last stage of 1st day. We spent so much time on the front it never occurred to us to check the rear suspension mounts...</p><p>When I entered that event I asked the co-driver what he thought and then tried to close his door, but it would not latch. Had to rebuild the mechanism before tech that morning. Foreshadowing at its best.</p><p>I think I'll stick to cars made in this century.

So for my stash boxes [1] (I've only made 3 so far -- all prototypes), I have an "air-tight" lid that requires being within 0.001-inches, and the lid incorporates a rolling tray on the underside, so you open it, flip it over, it reseats inside the box, and you have a stable tray to grind you herbs and roll a joint. I haven't figured out mass production on it yet, though, so each one takes me about 2 hours of work, and none of them are perfect, but that is the fun part of it. Figuring out how to make something is easy, figuring out how to make it more than once and quickly is a challenge.</p><p>1: <a href="https://instagram.com/p/CvpUKVBLph3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://instagram.com/p/CvpUKVBLph3/</a>

Running the heat off 1500W was stupidly inefficient, so I went out and acquired one of those tankless propane-powered hot water heaters and rigged it to a commercial RV water pump and a 20# propane tank to circulate water into the hot tub that way. It heated the tub up from ~50* faucet to 104* hot in about 3 hours, instead of closer to 30 on 120V power.<p>The other thing I built is more of a lifehack living with sleep apnea. My CPAP's humidifier failed, and instead of replacing it with another proprietary humidifier, I bought an external CPAP humidifier[1] and then realized I could, with some clever plumbing, rig up a water pump from an external gallon jug of water to automatically re-fill my humidifier in the morning at the push (and hold) of a button. I took an oxygen-insertion tee, 12v pump, and some tubing and a check valve and attached the pump to the oxygen line on one of the inlets of the humidifier chamber. When you push the button, water flows through, through the check valve, and immediately down into the chamber.</p><p>Here's a snapshot of an early test: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vund22E.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://i.imgur.com/vund22E.png</a></p><p>It's been tweaked a little bit since then but it's my FAVORITE thing on my nightstand now.

It is light actuated so when you open the box it starts playing a track from the record, skipping one track ahead each time it is opened.  It mostly uses off the shelf components for the electronics, and found and decorated the box (sanding/staining/varnish on the outside, and a watercolor painting on the inside. It took quite a lot of effort to get the audio formatted and compressed enough to get it all working, but I think it is really a beautiful object on several levels.</span></p></div></td></tr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The latest version of Intel Arc GPU Graphics Software introduced an interesting change that isn't reflected in the Release Notes. The installer of the 101.4578 beta drivers add a "Compute Improvement Program" (CIP) component as part of the "typical" setup option that is enabled by default. Under the "custom" installer option that you have to activate manually, you get to select which components to install. The Compute Improvement Program can be unchecked here, to ensure data collection is disabled. The benignly named CIP is a data collection component that tracks your PC usage and performance in the background (not just that of the GPU), so Intel can use the data to improve its future products. Intel created a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/topics/idsa-cip.html" target="_blank">dedicated webpage</a> that spells out what CIP is, and what its scope of data collection is; where is says that CIP "does not collect your name, email address, phone number, sensitive personal information, or physical location (except for country)."</p><p>

Intel CIP is functionally similar to the Telemetry component of the GeForce Software. NVIDIA's Telemetry is installed and enabled by default along with your GeForce graphics drivers, and you cannot opt out from it, as it does not even figure in the "custom" installer options. AMD handles its version of CIP and Telemetry in arguably the most transparent manner. The installer of AMD Software Adrenalin presents the option to prevent its data-collection tool from being enabled at the completion of driver installation, regardless of whether you've chosen the "typical," "driver only," or "custom" install options. There's an entire page of the installer dedicated to this, you see a large checkbox about data-collection that's checked by default, but which you can uncheck, and complete installation.</p><p><a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/img/Vd7Bo9PJ56UUwPyK.jpg" target="_blank" data-width="844" data-height="645" data-fancybox="g312122"><img src="https://tpucdn.com/img/Vd7Bo9PJ56UUwPyK_thm.jpg" width="170" height="130" alt=""></a> <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/img/Ut3YdxBy6bssIz4e.jpg" target="_blank" data-width="1645" data-height="1000" data-fancybox="g312122"><img src="https://tpucdn.com/img/Ut3YdxBy6bssIz4e_thm.jpg" width="214" height="130" alt=""></a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>Someone recently asked me – “how do you deal with writing in public? People on
the internet are such assholes!”</p>

<p>I’ve often heard the advice “don’t read the comments”, but actually I’ve
learned a huge amount from reading internet comments on my posts from strangers
over the years, even if sometimes people are jerks. So I want to explain some
tactics I use to try to make the comments on my posts more informative and
useful to me, and to try to minimize the number of annoying comments I get.</p>

<h3 id="talk-about-facts">talk about facts</h3>

<p>On here I mostly talk about facts – either facts about computers, or stories
about my experiences using computers.</p>

<p>For example <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/03/16/tcpdump-is-amazing/">this post</a> about tcpdump contains some basic facts about how to use tcpdump,
as well as an example of how I’ve used it in the past.</p>

<p>Talking about facts means I get a lot of fact-based comments like:</p>

<ul>
<li>people sharing their own similar (or different) experiences (“I use tcpdump a lot to look at our RTP sequence numbers”)</li>
<li>pointers to other resources (“the documentation from F5 about tcpdump is great”)</li>
<li>other interesting related facts I didn’t mention (“you can use tcpdump -X
too”, “netsh on windows is great”, “you can use <code>sudo tcpdump -s 0 -A
'tcp[((tcp[12:1] &amp; 0xf0) &gt;&gt; 2):4] = 0x47455420'</code> to filter for HTTP GET requests)</li>
<li>potential problems or gotchas (“be careful about running tcpdump as root, try just setting the required capabilities instead”)</li>
<li>questions (“Is there a way to place the BPF filter after IP packet reassembly?” or “what’s the advantage of tcpdump over wireshark?”)</li>
<li>mistakes I made</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, I’d say that people’s comments about facts tend to stay pretty
normal. The main kinds of negative comments I get about facts are:</p>

<ul>
<li>occasionally people get a little rude about facts I didn’t mention (“Didn’t
use -n in any of the examples…please…“). I think I didn’t mention <code>-n</code> in
that post because at the time I didn’t know why the <code>-n</code> flag was useful
(it’s useful because it turns off this annoying reverse DNS lookup that
tcpdump does by default so you can see the IP addresses).</li>
<li>people are also sometimes weird about mistakes. I mostly try to head this off
by trying to be self-aware about my knowledge level on a topic, and saying
“I’m not sure…” when I’m not sure about something.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="stories-are-great">stories are great</h3>

<p>I think stories encourage pretty good discussion. For example, <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2015/11/21/why-you-should-understand-a-little-about-tcp/">why you should understand (a little) about TCP</a>
is a story about a time it was important for me to understand how TCP worked.</p>

<p>When I share stories about problems I solved, the comments really help me
understand how what I learned fits into a bigger context. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>is this a common problem? people will often comment saying “this happened to me too!”</li>
<li>what are other common related problems that come up?</li>
<li>are there other possible solutions I didn’t consider?</li>
</ul>

<p>Also I think these kinds of stories are incredibly important – that post
describes a bug that was VERY hard for me to solve, and the only reason I was
able to figure it out in the first place was that I read <a href="https://gocardless.com/blog/in-search-of-performance-how-we-shaved-200ms-off-every-post-request/">this blog post</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ask-technical-questions">ask technical questions</h3>

<p>Often in my blog posts I ask technical questions that I don’t know the answer
to (or just mention “I don’t know X…”). This helps people focus their
replies a little bit – an obvious comment to make is to provide an answer to
the question, or explain the thing I didn’t know!</p>

<p>This is fun because it feels like a guaranteed way to get value out of people’s
comments – people LOVE answering questions, and so they get to look smart, and
I get the answer to a question I have! Everyone wins!</p>

<h3 id="fix-mistakes">fix mistakes</h3>

<p>I make a lot of mistakes in my blog posts, because I write about a lot of
things that are on the edge of my knowledge. When people point out mistakes, I
often edit the blog post to fix it.</p>

<p>Usually I’ll stay near a computer for a few hours after I post a blog post so
that I can fix mistakes quickly as they come up.</p>

<p>Some people are very careful to list every single error they made in their blog
posts (“errata: the post previously said X which was wrong, I have corrected it
to say Y”). Personally I make mistakes constantly and I don’t have time for
that so I just edit the post to fix the mistakes.</p>

<h3 id="ask-for-examples-experiences-not-opinions">ask for examples/experiences, not opinions</h3>

<p>A lot of the time when I post a blog post, people on Twitter/Mastodon will
reply with various opinions they have about the thing. For example, someone
recently replied to a blog post about DNS saying that they love using zone
files and dislike web interfaces for managing DNS records. That’s not an
opinion I share, so I asked them why.</p>

<p>They explained that there are some DNS record types (specifically <code>TLSA</code>) that they find
often aren’t supported in web interfaces. I didn’t know that people used <code>TLSA</code>
records, so I learned something! Cool!</p>

<p>I’ve found that asking people to share their <strong>experiences</strong> (“I wanted to use
X DNS record type and I couldn’t”) instead of their <strong>opinions</strong>  (“DNS web
admin interfaces are bad”) leads to a lot of useful information and
discussion. I’ve learned a lot from it over the years, and written a lot of
tweets like “which DNS record types have you needed?” to try to extract more
information about people’s experiences.</p>

<p>I try to model the same behaviour in my own work when I can – if I have an
opinion, I’ll try to explain the experiences I’ve had with computers that
caused me to have that opinion.</p>

<h3 id="start-with-a-little-context">start with a little context</h3>

<p>I think internet strangers are more likely to reply in a weird way when they
have no idea who you are or why you’re writing this thing. It’s easy to make
incorrect assumptions! So often I’ll mention a little context about why I’m
writing this particular blog post.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A little while ago I started using a Mac, and one of my biggest frustrations
with it is that often I need to run Linux-specific software.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve started to run a few more servers recently (nginx playground, mess with
dns, dns lookup), so I’ve been thinking about monitoring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last night, I needed to scan some documents for some bureaucratic reasons.
I’d never used a scanner on Linux before and I was worried it would take hours
to figure out…</p>

<h3 id="avoid-causing-boring-conversations">avoid causing boring conversations</h3>

<p>There are some kinds of programming conversations that I find extremely boring
(like “should people learn vim?” or “is functional programming better than
imperative programming?“). So I generally try to avoid writing blog posts that
I think will result in a conversation/comment thread that I find annoying or
boring.</p>

<p>For example, I wouldn’t write about my opinions about functional programming: I
don’t really have anything interesting to say about it and I think it would
lead to a conversation that I’m not interested in having.</p>

<p>I don’t always succeed at this of course (it’s impossible to predict what
people are going to want to comment about!), but I try to avoid the most
obvious flamebait triggers I’ve seen in the past.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of “flamebait” triggers that can set people off on a
conversation that I find boring: cryptocurrency, tailwind, DNSSEC/DoH, etc. So
I have a weird catalog in my head of things not to mention if I don’t want to
start the same discussion about that thing for the 50th time.</p>

<p>Of course, if you think that conversations about functional programming are
interesting, you should write about functional programming and start the
conversations you want to have!</p>

<p>Also, it’s often possible to start an interesting conversation about a topic
where the conversation is normally boring. For example I often see the same
talking points about IPv6 vs IPv4 over and over again, but I remember the
comments on <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/01/29/reasons-for-servers-to-support-ipv6/">Reasons for servers to support IPv6</a>
being pretty interesting. In general if I really care about a topic I’ll talk
about it anyway, but I don’t care about functional programming very much so I
don’t see the point of bringing it up.</p>

<h3 id="preempt-common-suggestions">preempt common suggestions</h3>

<p>Another kind of “boring conversation” I try to avoid is suggestions of things I
have already considered. Like when someone says “you should do X” but I
already know I could have done X and chose not to because of A B C.</p>

<p>So I often will add a short note like “I decided not to do X because of A B
C” or “you can also do X” or “normally I would do X, here I didn’t because…”.
For example, in <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/02/28/some-notes-on-using-nix/">this post about nix</a>, I list a bunch
of Nix features I’m choosing not to use (nix-shell, nix flakes, home manager)
to avoid a bunch of helpful people telling me that I should use flakes.</p>

<p>Listing the things I’m <em>not</em> doing is also helpful to readers – maybe
someone new to nix will discover nix flakes through that post and decide to use
them! Or maybe someone will learn that there are exceptions to when a certain
“best practice” is appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="set-some-boundaries">set some boundaries</h3>

<p>Recently on Mastodon I complained about <a href="https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk/110797431090302792">some gross terminology that I’d just noticed in the dig man page</a>. A few dudes in the
replies asked me to prove that the original author <em>intended</em> it to be
offensive (which of course is besides the point, there’s just no need to have
<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/groper">a term widely understood to be referring to sexual assault</a>
in the dig man page) or tried to explain to me why
it actually wasn’t a problem.</p>

<p>So I blocked a few people and wrote a quick post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>man so many dudes in the replies demanding that i prove that the person who
named dig “domain information groper” intended it in an offensive way. Big day
for the block button I guess :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t do this too often, but I think it’s very important on social media to
occasionally set some rules about what kind of behaviour I won’t tolerate. My
goal here is usually to drive away some of the assholes (they can unfollow me!)
and try to create a more healthy space for everyone else to have a conversation
about computers in.</p>

<p>Obviously this only works in situations (like Twitter/Mastodon) where I have
the ability to garden my following a little bit over time – I can’t do this on
HN or Reddit or Lobsters or whatever and wouldn’t try.</p>

<p>(you might notice that this section is breaking the “avoid boring
conversations” rule above, this section was certain to start a very boring
argument, but I felt it was important to talk about boundaries so I left it in)</p>

<h3 id="don-t-argue">don’t argue</h3>

<p>Sometimes people seem to want to get into arguments or make dismissive
comments. I don’t reply to them, even if they’re <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">wrong</a>. I dislike arguing on
the internet and I’m extremely bad at it, so it’s not a good use of my time.</p>



<p>If I get a lot of negative comments that I didn’t expect, I try to see if I can
get something useful out of it.</p>

<p>For example, I wrote a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/02/01/a-dns-resolver-in-80-lines-of-go/">toy DNS resolver</a> once and some of the commenters
were upset that I didn’t handle parsing the DNS packet. At the time I thought
this was silly (I thought DNS parsing was really straightforward and that it
was obvious how to do it, who cares that I didn’t handle it?) but I realized
that maybe the commenters didn’t think it was easy or obvious, and wanted to
know how to do it. Which makes sense! It’s not obvious at all if you haven’t
done it before!</p>

<p>Those comments partly inspired <a href="https://implement-dns.wizardzines.com/">implement DNS in a weekend</a>, which focuses much more
heavily on the parsing aspects, and which I think is a much better explanation
how to write a DNS resolver. So ultimately those comments helped me a lot, even
if I found them annoying at the time.</p>

<p>(I realize this section makes me sound like a Perfectly Logical Person who does
not get upset by negative public criticism, I promise this is not at all the
case and I have 100000 feelings about everything that happens on the internet
and get upset all the time. But I find that analyzing the criticism and trying
to take away something useful from it helps a bit)</p>
