<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>The Enterprise Linux model works something like this:</p>
<p>It’s decided to snapshot a collection of upstream open source projects at a specific version, including the Linux kernel, to form as the basis of a new cohesive version of an Enterprise Linux distribution. This collection of software will remain locked at its specific version throughout the lifespan of that Enterprise Linux distribution release – which is often 10 years or more.</p>
<p>The engineers, maintainers, and testers behind these distributions then put in the enormous amount of thankless work of bug fixes, tests, QA, documentation, etc. It’s a massive undertaking of tedious painstaking work. At the end of the process, you end up with a relatively stable Linux distribution that works well and they release it to the world.</p>
<p>The next phase of hard work begins for that release. Keeping the large collection of software secured and as bug-free as possible as their upstream counterparts continue to churn and release new versions. The maintainers of your Enterprise Linux distribution must carefully keep track of the ocean of changes.</p>
<p>The process often looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://unix.foo/images/wharrgarbl.jpg" alt="WHARGARBL"></p>
<p>In practice, what this works out to is they freeze packages at a specific version for a long time and only ever backport fixes for the most egregious of bugs or security issues that receive a CVE.</p>
<p>Sounds good, right? Nope. Not for security. There’s a lot wrong with this model.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14565">research shows</a>: “Despite the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) publishes identified vulnerabilities, a vast majority of vulnerabilities and their corresponding security patches remain beyond public exposure”.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on the example of one of the largest ongoing open source projects: The Linux kernel. According to the 2020 Linux Kernel History Report, the Linux kernel project receives about 10 changes per hour, or approximately 225 changes per day. The team behind the kernel does not treat security bugs as something special. It’s simply another bug. All bugs are equal in the eyes of the project. They do not designate a particular bugfix as security related in the commit logs. They do not publish advisories. In fact, the vast majority of CVEs found for the Linux kernel are only retroactively identified as security researchers and interested parties pore over the changes and realize that a few of those bugfixes are indeed closing security gaps. Only then do they file for a CVE for the issue.</p>
<p>Quite often, most identified CVEs were fixed months ago in the stable kernel release. That’s not even thinking about the huge pile of unidentified CVEs lurking in the sea of bugfixes. Multiply this problem times the total number of packages that make up an Enterprise Linux distribution and you end up with a huge vulnerability window.</p>
<p>The fundamental issue is that the Enterprise Linux model optimizes for stability at the expense of security. By locking packages to specific versions and only backporting select fixes, these distributions lag significantly behind upstream versions when it comes to security bugfixes, albeit unintentionally.</p>
<p>Defenders will counter that this is a necessary tradeoff – you can’t have both stability and being fully up-to-date on security fixes. I’m not convinced that’s true as there are other Linux distributions that have shown you can have both. Rolling release distributions like OpenSUSE Tumbleweed follow upstream much more closely while still maintaining stability through thorough <a href="https://openqa.opensuse.org/">automated testing</a>. Additionally, distributions like Fedora Linux, while not technically a rolling release, do tend to hew close to upstream versions at a more regular cadence.</p>
<p>Even so, these type of distributions are not a panacea and operational challenges may present themselves with staying close to upstream given your application or team needs.</p>
<p>There does exist a middle ground, but you’re probably not going to like hearing it.</p>
<h2 id="the-case-for-oracle-linux">The Case for Oracle Linux</h2>
<p>I need you to set aside your automatic (and justified) repulsion to what you just read. Yes, I know that Oracle has earned every bit of their reputation amongst engineers. I’m totally with you on that – I am not affiliated with Oracle in any way.</p>
<p>But stop screaming for a moment and hear me out.</p>
<p>The Oracle Linux project was started in October 2006 as a downstream rebuild of RHEL. They simply took Red Hat’s sources, recompiled it and put their branding on it, and sold their own support contracts for it in an attempt to undercut Red Hat’s business.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, they’ve continued this work and publish all their work on <a href="https://yum.oracle.com/">yum.oracle.com</a> which is freely available. As their very own site and explanation states in the <a href="https://linux.oracle.com/switch/centos/">FAQ</a>:</p>
<p><em>Q. Wait, doesn’t Oracle Linux cost money?</em></p>
<p><em>A. Oracle Linux support costs money. If you just want the software, it’s 100% free. And it’s all in our yum repo at yum.oracle.com. Major releases, errata, the whole shebang. Free source code, free binaries, free updates, freely redistributable, free for production use. Yes, we know that this is Oracle, but it’s actually free. Seriously.</em></p>
<p>Where it got interesting was in September 2010 when Oracle <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2010/09/20/oracle_own_linux/">announced</a> one optional departure for their RHEL clone: the pompously named Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel.</p>
<p>Oracle was now offering everyone two kernels: The Red Hat Compatible Kernel (RHCK) and their own Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK).</p>
<p>Over time, UEK has evolved into a unique Enterprise Linux kernel offering that more closely tracks the upstream Linux kernel. Rather than cherry picking individual fixes to backport to their kernel the way most Enterprise Linux distributions do, the model they’ve <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/post/tracking-linux-stable-kernels-with-uek">found works best</a> “has been to lag behind the tip of the LTS tree by less than four weeks”.</p>
<p>They use that small lag time to perform their typical “enterprise” validation and testing process before shipping an updated UEK release.</p>
<p>By sticking much closer to the upstream kernel releases at regular intervals, they are able to keep up with the enormous amount of bugfixes that go into the kernel – whether they were security related or not.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting middle ground option for one of the more critical components of an Enterprise Linux distribution. You can rely on the operational stability of the overall distribution tooling, but still have a relatively updated (and validated) kernel.</p>
<p>Oracle has also publicly continued to <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/blog/keep-linux-open-and-free-2023-07-10/">commit</a> to keeping “…the binaries and source code for that distribution publicly and freely available”. At this point their distribution has been around for 17 years, and they’ve never tried to restrict access to their source code in that time.</p>
<p>It feels wrong to speak positively about an Oracle product, but Oracle Linux is actually a good option worthy of our consideration.</p>
<p>Just don’t tell <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Ellison">Larry</a> I said that.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The year is 1997, and famed Studio Ghibli director Hayao Miyazaki <a href="https://www.j-cast.com/2013/09/02182759.html?p=all">announced plans to retire following the release of <em>Princess Mononoke</em></a>, a film that set new records at the box office for Japanese animation and revolutionized the medium. The year is 2001, and Miyazaki announced plans to retire following the release of <em>Spirited Away,</em> saying he can no longer work on feature-length animated films. The year is 2013, and Miyazaki announced plans to retire following the release of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/23/5337826/the-wind-rises-the-beauty-and-controversy-of-miyazakis-final-film"><em>The Wind Rises</em></a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hayao-miyazaki-explains-why-hes-retiring-1261922844">saying that</a> “If I said I wanted to [make another feature film], I would sound like an old man saying something foolish.”</p><p>The year is 2023, and Miyazaki is an old man saying something foolish by releasing a new film, titled <em>How Do You Live</em> in Japan and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/14/23795086/studio-ghibli-how-do-you-live-the-boy-and-the-heron-hayao-miyazaki">renamed <em>The Boy and the Heron</em></a> for the international market.</p><p>The point is, it’s hard to say with any certainty whether this will truly be the moment when Hayao Miyazaki steps away from feature animation for good (he’ll likely never step away from animation entirely, directing a new short for the Ghibli Museum during his last retirement, <a href="https://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/films/works/#boro_the_caterpillar"><em>Boro the Caterpillar</em></a>). Until a few days ago, it was also hard to say what this mysteriously titled final film would actually be about, following a bold PR strategy of, well, not doing any PR. Only a single poster for the film featuring a heron was released before its theatrical debut, without so much as press or preview screenings, trailers, screenshots, or even a synopsis.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A poster for Studio Ghibli’s How Do You Live." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/376x532/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/384x543/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/415x587/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/480x679/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/540x764/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/640x905/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/750x1061/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/828x1171/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/1080x1528/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/1200x1698/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/1440x2037/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/1920x2716/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/2048x2897/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/2400x3395/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x2716/2400x3395/filters:focal(960x1358:961x1359):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792322/Poster_Teaser.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>The only piece of promotional art for the film.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Studio Ghibli</cite></p></div></div><p>Riding the train in the early hours of Friday morning to be one of the first to catch this all-new Miyazaki-directed feature film, <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> appeared to exist only as some mythical entity rather than a real film. In the absence of any news and in light of the single image’s striking repetitiveness, Japanese fans even resorted to creating memes of the bird, <a href="https://twitter.com/ce_lemony/status/1679042978478968840?s=46&amp;t=f_Mv93lXcUyV0D1_x5MQGg">riffing on the name</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/bkub_comic/status/1678763787615346689?s=46&amp;t=f_Mv93lXcUyV0D1_x5MQGg">mystery surrounding it</a>. Honestly, a part of me wondered if the whole thing was some trick, a ruse soon to be exposed to the world at last.</p><p>Another part wondered: if this film actually was real, what story would prompt Miyazaki out of his latest retirement? And how would I even discuss a film like this when even saying it exists could technically class as a spoiler?</p><p>I have that answer now. To give the minimal necessary introduction, the film opens during the firebombing of Tokyo in World War II, a hazy memory of the moment that young boy Mahito witnessed the death of his mother as the hospital she was in burned to the ground. The experience is seared in his mind like the erupting flames he witnessed, never truly moving on from the pain of this sudden loss. When Mahito joins his father to move out of Tokyo shortly after the war to live with his new (and already pregnant) partner in a large traditional home full of peculiarities — like a mysterious heron and an old abandoned stone building in the woods nearby — he struggles to accept this new situation.</p><p>These opening moments feel unsettling and heavy, especially in flashbacks, only briefly relieved by the kindly gaggle of old ladies at the home or the famed heron. While it embraces the fantastical as it takes us to a whole new world in pursuit of a far-from-normal heron’s promise that Mahito can see his mother once more (while continuing to search for his new mother who recently went missing), the weight of this opening lingers.&nbsp;</p><p>In these moments, it’s a rich, dense fantasy in the vein we’ve come to expect, both in terms of the detail visible in every scene and its greater thematic purpose. You may come to <em>Spirited Away</em> for its eclectic and intricate spiritual bathhouse, but you stay for the human story and deeper undertones at its core.</p><p>Continuing this comparison, you could even say these musings on the complexity of the human condition are emphasized by the 82-year-old Miyazaki with this final film, creating something that feels more autobiographical and self-reflective than <em>The Wind Rises</em>. For all that film was technically a biopic, it felt as much a reflection of the man behind the production as it was the master aviator at its center. While fantastical and family-friendly elements litter <em>The Boy and the Heron</em>, filling it to the brim with whimsy that lightens its heavy moments and brings endless charm to its stunning animation, the frank nature in which it explores Miyazaki’s self-reflective musings on memory makes it as much a conversation with the man in the mirror as it is the audience.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A photo of Hayao Miyazaki at the Academy Of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences’ 2014 Governors Awards." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/376x250/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/384x256/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/415x276/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/480x319/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/540x359/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/640x426/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/750x499/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/828x551/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/1080x719/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/1200x799/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/1440x958/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/1920x1278/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/2048x1363/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/2400x1597/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4928x3280/2400x1597/filters:focal(2464x1640:2465x1641):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792351/458669204.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>Hayao Miyazaki.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Frazer Harrison / Getty Images</cite></p></div></div><p>The question the film’s Japanese title poses lingers throughout the experience. How <em>do</em> you live? On the shoulders of those who came before you. After decades of defining the animation industry in Japan, Miyazaki has accepted his fate. This is ultimately a story about the hows and whys that define our memory, a recognition that no existence can live without building upon the inventions, experiences, and memories of those who came before us. A recognition that to move forward means to move on and let go of the past while keeping their memories and lessons close for the next person to carry that torch.</p><p><em>The Boy and the Heron</em> feels like a recognition by Miyazaki of his place as a relic in a modern animation industry that’s moved on without him. Studio Ghibli has firmly embedded itself within animation history and particularly Japanese culture, where movies like <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em> and <em>Kiki’s Delivery Service</em> feel like rights of passage for Japanese children even before we discuss the park or museum or the copious merchandising. People who don’t watch anime or look down on animation as some childish toy likely still know and love at least one Ghibli film. Totoro was a character in <em>Toy Story 3</em>!</p><p>Yet it’s also been 10 years since Miyazaki released his last film and nine years since Ghibli’s final feature, <em>When Marnie Was There</em>. For all the media at one point seemed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/09/makoto-shinkai-director-anime-your-name">determined to anoint the so-called “next Miyazaki,”</a> only the spiritual successor made up of former veterans of Ghibli, Studio Ponoc, ever attempted to directly emulate the distinct visual and narrative playbook of the famed studio. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Du8tsjNYEYKQ"><em>Mary and the Witch’s Flower</em></a> released to moderate success in 2017, but notably, the first trailer for the studio’s new project <em>The Imaginary</em> premiered before this screening with a visual and thematic approach that serves as a distinct departure.</p><p>The anime landscape today is defined by a different director: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/15/23678724/makoto-shinkai-suzume-interview">Makoto Shinkai</a>. Films like <em>Five Centimeters Per Second</em>, <em>Your Name,</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23680219/suzume-review"><em>Suzume</em></a>, with their intense post-processing over highly realistic environments telling stories about love and distance through the imagery of fantasy and science fiction, are nonetheless impressive but are very distinct from the works of Ghibli in their own, more modern style. In recent years, with the success of Shinkai’s works, the comparisons have stopped. You can’t be the next Miyazaki when you’ve already eclipsed the man you’re being compared to.</p><p>When it’s not Shinkai or one of his many imitators, recognizable franchises reign stronger than ever. Anime has always relied on adaptations of other mediums, but the shift from historically lower gross for such films as mere fan service to the blockbusters of today showcases a stark difference. Last year, <a href="https://eiga.com/news/20230130/8/"><em>One Piece Film RED</em> grossed almost 20 billion yen in Japan</a>, making it one of the top 10 highest-grossing films of all time and placing it above <em>Howl’s Moving Castle</em> and all but two of Miyazaki’s works. <em>The First Slam Dunk</em> has <a href="https://lp.p.pia.jp/article/news/276201/index.html?detail=tru">similarly been breaking records</a> and <a href="http://www.kogyotsushin.com/archives/topics/t8/202301/23153909.php">topped the box office for eight consecutive weeks</a> upon release. And let’s not forget the monster 2020 success of <em>Demon Slayer: Mugen Train</em>, whose 40 billion yen domestic gross demolished <em>Spirited Away</em>’s record of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334004/demon-slayer-the-movie-mugen-train-north-america-release-theaters">highest-grossing film of all time in Japan</a>.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Merchandise for Oscar-winning animator Hayao Miyazaki’s latest film, titled in English “How Do You Live?” is displayed for sale at a cinema on the first day of the film’s premiere in Tokyo on July 14, 2023." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/376x251/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/384x256/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/415x277/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/480x320/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/540x360/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/640x427/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/750x500/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/828x552/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/1080x720/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/1200x800/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/1440x960/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/1920x1280/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/2048x1365/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/2400x1600/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:5694x3796/2400x1600/filters:focal(2847x1898:2848x1899):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24792356/1531247547.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><cite>Photo by Richard A. Brooks / AFP via Getty Images</cite></p></div><p>The point is, we don’t see films like this being made anymore, for better and for worse. There’s no glee or joy in discussing Miyazaki’s fading stardom. Indeed, with <em>The Boy and the Heron</em>, Miyazaki has produced one of his best films to date, a mature metafictional tale in a friendlier facade about memory and moving on from the past while carrying their precious experiences on their shoulders.</p><p>Yet the industry <em>has</em> moved on. This film feels thematically and visually like a lost piece of mid-2000s Ghibli media resurfaced from a vault and thrown onto cinema screens. No less impressive, but a piece of the past carried on the shoulders of those who built it, tossed into the world more to remember what we lost than to build upon what we have today. You could argue there’s irony in making a film about letting go and moving forward when a director can’t follow through with his desire to walk away, but maybe that’s why this movie had to be made.</p><div><p>We don’t see films like this being made anymore, for better and for worse</p></div><p>Honestly, so moved and impressed I was by this movie, I’d love for him to betray its message and come back, just one more time. The creative well underneath Miyazaki remains full, and I’m sure he could create another 10 films and still have new ideas to explore. We’ve barely scratched the surface of his bottomless talent.</p><p>In the movie’s first act, Mahito finds an old copy of <em>How Do You Live?</em>, the children’s book that inspired the film’s Japanese title. The title page is signed by his mother with a message of how much he’s grown. He breaks down in tears. The adventure which follows proves that she was right, and the book stays with him throughout, another memory passed down for him to bear.</p><p>Just as Mahito needs to accept the loss of his mother, leaving that cinema on Friday morning felt like closing the book on an era of animation history we’ll never get back. The items passed on to Mahito by the characters in this fantasy world are ways to remember his adventure and reconnection to his mother, just as we can always rewatch these films. And remember we must, as it’s only by passing these memories down that they can live on long after the people behind them are gone.</p><p>Miyazaki has accepted his time has come and gone, and this is his plea to be remembered by the next generation. With this understanding, everything from the film’s complex yet thematically resonant story to particularly its non-existent promotional campaign made sense. Releasing a film without a single trailer, screenshot, or even synopsis feels like career suicide, a sure chance a film will fail. It’s a strategy that could only succeed at the hands of a studio and director who earned respect like these two. In turn, this campaign is a final plea from Miyazaki to the public who admire him and his work.</p><p>Memories only outlive us by sharing them with others, ensuring they won’t be forgotten with our passing. Similarly, if we want this era of animation to be remembered for generations to come, the onus is on us as an audience to champion its voice and share it with others. Ghibli and Miyazaki already have their place in history. If <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> is to join it, we have to want to pass it on, hold it close, and carry it with us.</p><p>And, after all that, move forward.</p><p><small>How Do You Live <em>is in Japanese theaters now. Distributor GKIDS says that it will be released “theatrically in North America later this year” under the English title</em> The Boy and the Heron.</small></p></div></div>]]></description>

<h3>Flicking lights or swiping wipers could one day add extra security to vehicles</h3>

<p>Skyrocketing vehicle theft rates in some U.S. cities have drawn attention to an inconvenient truth: the increasing amount of technology in our vehicles can make them increasingly vulnerable to hacking or theft.</p>



<p>Now, a solution that leverages perhaps the lowest-tech feature of today’s vehicles—the auxiliary power outlet, known to those of a certain age as the cigarette lighter—has been developed by a University of Michigan-led research team.</p>



<p>With a new $1.2 million dollar grant from the National Science Foundation, the team is set to begin large-scale testing of Battery Sleuth, a vehicle security system that can protect against sophisticated wireless hacking, old-school jimmying and everything in between.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Battery Sleuth bypasses both the wireless communication that key fobs depend on and the standardized onboard communication network that’s used in today’s vehicles. Instead, it authenticates drivers by measuring voltage fluctuations in a vehicle’s electrical system. Drivers interact with it through a keypad device plugged into the auxiliary power outlet.</p>



<p>“The great thing about the power outlet is its simplicity—it’s just a wire connected to the battery, so there’s nothing to hack,” said Kang Shin, the Kevin and Nancy O’Connor Professor of Computer Science at U-M and lead researcher on the project. “And creating voltage fluctuations with components like windshield wipers or door locks is even simpler.”</p>



<figure><a href="https://news.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/mc-image-cache/2023/07/a-surprisingly-simple-way-to-foil-car-thieves-dongle2.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="300" height="300" src="https://news.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-surprisingly-simple-way-to-foil-car-thieves-dongle2-300x300.png" alt="An experimental prototype of the Battery Sleuth code entry device installed in a vehicle.

Image credit: Kang Shin</figcaption></figure>



<p>Battery Sleuth delivers a predetermined series of voltage fluctuations—a sort of “voltage fingerprint”—to the car’s electrical system when the driver enters a numerical code into the keypad device. A receiver then recognizes this fingerprint and enables the vehicle to start. Drivers can also deliver the voltage fluctuation manually using auxiliary functions that draw battery power. They might perform some combination of flicking the windshield wipers, turn signal or headlights on and off, or locking and unlocking the doors.</p>



<p>Installed between a vehicle’s battery and the car’s electrical system, Battery Sleuth’s default mode allows the battery to deliver enough current to power systems like electronics and lights, but not enough to power the vehicle’s starter. Only when it detects the pre-set series of voltage fluctuations in the vehicle’s electrical system does it turn up the juice, allowing the battery’s full power through to the starter.</p>



<p>“The idea of measuring fluctuations in a car’s electrical system seems simple, but designing one device that can do it accurately on thousands of different vehicle models in varying environmental conditions gets quite complicated,” said Liang He, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Colorado, Denver and a researcher on the project. “We’re working to design a system that’s smart enough to measure the parameters of the vehicle it’s installed on and then customize itself to work effectively on that vehicle.”</p>



<p>Battery Sleuth also has defenses to guard against hacking or physical attacks on the device itself, including a siren that sounds if illegitimate activity is detected and a resistor that shuts down the vehicle’s electrical system if an unauthorized power source is connected to the vehicle. The system is designed to work as either an add-on to existing vehicles or a permanently installed component on new vehicles.</p>

Image credit: Kang Shin</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Vehicle theft costs drivers and insurance companies more than $4 billion each year in the United States alone, and that’s partly because today’s vehicles use a hodge-podge of computer systems that were never designed to work together,” Shin said. “Each new layer of technology introduces new security vulnerabilities, and rather than try to patch each one, we’ve developed a system that works completely independently.”</p>



<p>In a field test study on eight vehicles published in July 2022, the researchers showed that a prototype of Battery Sleuth was more than 99.9% effective at detecting and preventing illegitimate activity without interfering with normal vehicle operation. The team plans to use the new grant to fund more extensive testing at U-M’s Mcity test facility. The next stage of the process will also explore expanding the system to enable it to control entry to the car, making it useful for applications like vehicle sharing.</p>



<p>At the end of the three-year project, the team aims to have a commercially viable prototype that can be scaled up to commercial production, first as a theft deterrent device, and potentially later as a complete vehicle entry and control system that could replace traditional keys and fobs.</p>



<p>The research was supported by the National Science Foundation Division of Computer and Network Systems under the Computer Science and Engineering Directorate, grant number 2245223.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This transcript was prepared by a transcription service. This version may not be in its final form and may be updated.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Tommy Steed lives in upstate New York. He has bees, a border collie named Pete and a pickup truck with a bumper sticker saying he's a member of the local Fish and Game Club. But before retiring, Tommy worked on the telephone lines.</p><p>Tommy Steed: I started working for New York telephone in 1971. Neighborhoods like Harlem, Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, and the South Bronx.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Tommy was hired as a cable splicer. In this job, he had to maintain and install telephone cables, sometimes 20 feet up in the air, sometimes underground.</p><p>Tommy Steed: We would wipe the ends with molten solder and run a seam down the middle, make sure there was not one single bubble because that cable is going into a manhole for the next 100 years.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Tommy enjoyed his job, the camaraderie of the crews and being outside all day. But after about 15 years of work, something unexpected happened.</p><p>Tommy Steed: Maybe about 1987, 1988, I went down to our medical department in Manhattan. It was a routine annual examination, and about two weeks later, my boss came out and said, "You have to go back to medical department." I said, "What for?" He said, "They didn't tell me. They just said they need to draw blood."</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: That afternoon, Tommy made his way downtown to the company's medical department.</p><p>Tommy Steed: I went to the front desk and they gave me my file and they told me to walk down this long hallway, make a left at the end, and there'll be an open door with a nurse that'll take my blood. So, walking down the hall, I was curious like, "What the hell did he want my blood for?" I opened up my file and there was a yellow sticky note, "Test for lead only."</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Lead. The results of this test would show that Tommy's lead levels were off the charts. Tommy is one of tens of thousands of workers who've been exposed to lead through their work at AT&amp;T, Verizon, and other telecom companies. The companies say they follow safety guidelines for workers dealing with lead. For the past 18 months, The Wall Street Journal's been investigating the impacts that lead covered cables have on people and on the environment. The team found that telecom companies have known about the health risks posed by these cables for decades. Welcome to The Journal, our show about money, business, and power. I'm Kate Linebaugh. It's Friday, July 14th. Coming up on the show, the potential danger of lead cables and what telecom companies knew about it. Lead covered cables have been connecting the country since the late 1800s. Our colleague, Shalini Ramachandran, is part of The Wall Street Journal team that's been investigating them.</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: The telephone companies wanted to keep the water out of the copper wires that were transmitting signals all over America. Lead is a very malleable metal, and it was something that kept water out.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: By 1940, the majority of the country's phones were connected with lead covered cables. The company behind this was the massive Bell system, a predecessor of AT&amp;T, Verizon, and other telecom companies.</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: We saw that in a 1957 article published in the Bell Laboratory's Record, the entire system had used around 100 million pounds of lead in just the prior year alone.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: All that lead cable had to be installed and maintained. Work that was done by people like Tommy Steed. At the time, Tommy was working for a company called NYNEX that would eventually become part of Verizon.</p><p>Tommy Steed: Working with the cables brand new wasn't too bad, but when I was a linesman and we removed thousands and thousands of feet of this old lead cable that was decommissioned, that's where the danger came in.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Over time, newer technology replaced the need for lead covered cables.</p><p>Tommy Steed: The removal of these cables that were now porous from being out in the weather for 50 years, hot and cold, snow, rain, sun, that's when they really started deteriorating. It was the removal of these lead cables that I feel was the most dangerous part of our jobs because it created dust that we had to breathe.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: At any point did the company talk to you about how toxic lead is?</p><p>Tommy Steed: No.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Or give you protective gear?</p><p>Tommy Steed: No, they gave me... Excuse me. Let me go back. When I wiped lead sleeves with molten solder, they did give me protective gloves so I didn't get burnt because I couldn't do it if I got burnt.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Shalini talked to a number of former and current employees who also described inadequate protection.</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: When talking to a lot of the workers who've worked with the stuff over decades, most of them said they were never provided a mask. They said they were never provided respirators. There were no danger signs. Many said they learned lead work on the job. There was no safety training that they heard of.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: How have the telecom companies responded to your reporting?</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: In response to our reporting, the companies and USTelecom, a group that represents the broader telecom industry, they have defended their practices and say that they offer safety training and a lot of protective gear and masks and equipment to help workers handle lead properly. They also said that they follow regulatory safety guidelines for workers dealing with lead and offer training, and also offer blood lead testing for people who wish to get their blood lead levels checked.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Stories from workers like Tommy prompted Shalini and the team to go back to see what Bell Systems knew about lead and risks to employees. They found an old study done by medical staff at Bell.</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: A 1977 Bell study showed a snapshot of just how high lead levels were among female lead soldering workers at a unit of AT&amp;T. The workers had blood lead levels in the range of 25 to 45 micrograms per deciliter, which is very high. It was very known to AT&amp;T that there were high blood lead levels among workers.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Around the same time, Bell partnered with Mount Sinai Hospital System on a second study of 90 cable splicers, the job Tommy had. This one also came back showing high lead content in their blood. Shalini says the companies didn't necessarily act on that information.</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: From what we understand, there wasn't any sort of widespread reckoning in the Bell system that, "Oh my goodness, workers are exposed. This is a major problem. We have to deal with it." That didn't happen from our understanding and from the documents that we have seen. What we know is that they did publish safety manuals from time to time, but many of the workers we talked to said they never saw any kind of lead training. They kind of said that the safety manuals weren't really widely read and weren't really well known. It's not clear to us that they took major action after getting that knowledge from that study in the late seventies.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Did you try to find out why not?</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: It wasn't considered a big deal from the former executives we talked to. It didn't seem like people thought twice about it. It was just an old part of the network. We've moved on to fiber, we've moved on to other stuff, cell phones. It's just some old stuff out there, it's not a big deal.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Right. To find out more about how companies thought about lead, we called up Brad Allenby, a former AT&amp;T executive.</p><p>Brad Allenby: We had lead in a lot of uses.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: 20 years ago, brad was a vice president of environment health and safety for AT&amp;T. Our colleagues have done a major investigation and found all kinds of lead sheathed cables across the country. When you were working for AT&amp;T, were you aware of these cables?</p><p>Brad Allenby: Sure. Because it was part of the infrastructure. But it's important to note that that lead was a ubiquitous material in telecom.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: We've spoken with telecom workers who said they regularly came into contact with lead cables. Was that something you were aware of happening at AT&amp;T?</p><p>Brad Allenby: Not particularly aware of, but I wouldn't be surprised, you'd expect it. They were working with the infrastructure, so sure. But the question is that lead in a form that is liable to cause damage? Once you use a soldering iron and you begin to melt it, then you begin to get gaseous lead and that can be inhaled and that's more of an exposure problem. So the question would be, in a case like that, are they properly protected when and if that lead is mobilized?</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Right, and we spoke with cable splicers and they did say they soldered lead and then their blood was tested, they had high lead levels. At your time at AT&amp;T, was this on your mind in terms of putting in place safety protocols and monitoring lead exposure for workers?</p><p>Brad Allenby: Yeah, I can't speak to what the practices were at that time because that's 20 years ago. I can say generally that if there were exposure issues and we knew about it, we would've addressed it because among other things, that would've been an OSHA requirement and it would've been the right thing to do for our employees. If there's something like that that's causing potential problems, then of course you address it.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: OSHA oversees worker safety for the federal government. In a statement to The Journal, AT&amp;T said, "The legacy cables that remain in our network are maintained in compliance with applicable environmental, health, and safety rules." I asked Shalini if she spoke with any workers who are currently maintaining lead covered cables.</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: I talked to a cable splicer out in LA who talked about how when there're heavy rains, there's a lot of these lead sheathed cables that fail and they have to go into the manhole, cut them open with a lead chipping knife. He described even as of recently, a few months ago, opening up a big lead sheathed cable under ground and then repairing the copper wires inside.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: But importantly, and what you're saying is this isn't all just in the past. Workers today are still interacting with lead cables and having potential lead exposure?</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: That's correct. When actually I set out to understand this issue, I thought it was probably mostly a decades ago exposure. But in reality, with all of these lead sheathed cables still around, workers are still exposed to it.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Coming up, the potential health consequences of lead exposure. Around two years before Tommy Steed got his blood tested for lead, he was really ill.</p><p>Tommy Steed: I was in the prime of my life. I couldn't understand it, but the most significant marker was I would leave the garage in the morning, go for my morning breakfast, and as soon as I ate my bacon and eggs, I would vomit it all up so I knew something was significantly wrong. I went to this physician, this medical doctor in Riverdale, and I went back a few times because she performed so many different tests. But the one test we missed, which is a specific test, was for lead poisoning. We missed out, both of us missed out.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Eventually, Tommy ended up in his company medical office, walking down that long hallway about to get his blood tested for lead.</p><p>Tommy Steed: I went into the room and the nurse started drawing my blood. I asked her, I said, "Look, am I going to get the results of this test?" She said, "Oh, yeah." I said, "When?" She said, "Oh, about two weeks." I said, "Good, 'cause I'm going to call you." Two weeks went by, three weeks went by, nothing. I called her and she still would not tell me my results, but she said, "I'll give you a number to call, but it's a long distance number." I said, "Lady, I'll call Singapore. I work for the phone company, it's not going to cost me anything."
It was a 518 area code, which is Albany, New York. I called the phone number, the lady picked up the phone. I identified myself, "Thomas Steed calling. I was given this number to call." She said, "Oh yeah, Mr. Steed, I have your file right on my desk in front of me. Do you know where you're calling?" I said, "No, I don't." She says, "We are the New York State Department of Health and your employer was mandated to report your lead levels to us, and I have your file right here in front of me." That's how I found out I had lead poisoning, the New York State Department of Health. Now, by this time, I wasn't sick anymore because I was away from working with lead cable and I was doing new plastic polyethylene, brand new cable. I wasn't ill anymore and I still had lead poisoning, but I didn't know.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Shalini saw Tommy's blood test and it showed he had 43 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood, well above the average for the US population at the time of 2.8 micrograms. Verizon, which took over the company Tommy worked for said, "It has a robust health and safety program and that workers can get lead testing at any time at no cost." The company said, "Its work practices on lead cables are based on available science, legal requirements and guidance from medical and work safety organizations." I asked Shalini if Tommy Steed should have been told by his employer that he'd been exposed to lead when he was tested in 1988. She said yes.</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: Tommy Steed was working in the 1980s, which was after the first lead standard from OSHA was published. His blood lead test ended up over 40 micrograms per deciliter, which under OSHA standards, even at that time, he should have been informed. And for him, that never happened and that was as of the late eighties.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: What kind of problems can lead exposure cause?</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: Lead exposure can cause kidney, heart, and reproductive problems in adults, and it's classified as a probable carcinogen. The risks that people worry most about with lead is that it is a neurotoxin, so that means that it attacks the central nervous system and Parkinson's disease has been linked recently to lead exposure.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Shalini spoke with other former and current telecom employees who'd worked with lead and had health issues.</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: I talked to a number of women who worked in AT&amp;T central offices doing lead soldering work, connecting lead sheathed cables from the outside with the internal central office machinery. They actually showed gloves with the fingertips cut off because they had to do sort of small, intricate work to melt the solder with a soldering iron. So, they describe breathing in those fumes. They're not being sort of fans or exhaust around and feeling headaches often every day coming home from work and gastrointestinal issues, nausea, constipation, infertility issues, miscarriages. One woman had developed kidney cancer and had to have a kidney removed.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: AT&amp;T dismissed what it called anecdotal, non-evidence based linkages to individuals health symptoms. The company said symptoms, "Could be associated with a vast number of potential causes." When you think back on it, what's been the hardest thing?</p><p>Tommy Steed: That I was a loyal employee and my company was not loyal to me and not loyal to hundreds, maybe thousands of fellow craftsmen like myself.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: What do you say to them now?</p><p>Tommy Steed: Well, it's a different corporation now, but what I would say to them is, "Hey, safety is number one. Your employees lives are number one." After that, we'll work our darnedest to make the company, nevermind a Fortune 500, a Fortune 1 or 2. We'll dedicate ourselves to that but you have to accept some responsibility. You have to accept some decency. We're not cattle. We're human beings just like you.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: So Shalini, this is the end of a really long reporting project?</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: Yes. It's the longest investigation I've ever worked on.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: After those, what, 18 months of reporting with a team that's traveled all over the country, what would you say you found out?</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: The highest level finding that the old American telephone and telegraph, which is known as a Bell System, laid thousands of lead sheathed cables across the country, and many of them were abandoned in place and still remain out aerially, above schools, above houses and underground, underneath waterways that are used for drinking water. We've gone out and seen them, and moreover, done our testing with experts and we found that some of them are leaching lead into the environment.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: Who's responsible? I mean, it's old industrial waste in the environment.</p><p>Shalini Ramachandran: Basically, it's complicated. The question of whose responsible is complicated. On one hand, environmental law and precedent has held successor companies responsible for things that their predecessor companies did. That is well established in environmental law. However, if in the time these were laid, if it was okay and considered safe at the time, then cleanup could be a collective responsibility between the companies and the government. One of the things that this reporting opened my eyes to was that there is this old industrial detritus that we still continue to live around and they're here and they're potentially causing risks to our community. It just kind of opened our eyes to how much could be out there, we've only scratched the surface. And just the bigger picture that oftentimes things that we consider toxic now, might have been left in the environment years ago and not dealt with, and they're still out there.</p><p>Kate Linebaugh: That's all for today, Friday, July 14th.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://kenschutte.com/gzip-knn-paper/">https://kenschutte.com/gzip-knn-paper/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36758433">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>Bad numbers in the "gzip beats BERT" paper?</h3><p><i>2023-07-17</i></p><p>The recent paper,<i>“Low-Resource” Text Classification: A Parameter-Free Classification Method with Compressors</i> by Jiang et al. [<a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.426/">link</a>] recently received a lot of attention on twitter.</p><p>I recently checked out their <a href="https://github.com/bazingagin/npc_gzip">source code</a> to try to recreate their results and to try out  some related ideas.</p><p>
What I found (although I could be mistaken!)
is that there appears
to be a
bug (or at least an unexpected choice) in their kNN code
that makes all the accuracy numbers
for their method higher than
expected.
<b>[tldr: it is reporting a top-2 accuracy rather than a kNN(k=2) accuracy]</b>.</p><p>Table 5 from the paper was often included in tweets and shows the <code>gzip</code> method beating all these other neural-network-based methods:</p><p><a href="https://kenschutte.com/gzip-knn-paper/table5.png"><img src="https://kenschutte.com/gzip-knn-paper/table5.png"></a></p><p>
I'll explain the details below, but my
calculations for these experiments
are (first 4 datasets,
only the "Full" column):
        </p><table id="tab1"><thead><tr><th></th><th>KinyarwandaNews</th><th>KirundiNews</th><th>DengueFilipino</th><th>SwahiliNews</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>in paper</th><td>0.891</td><td>0.905</td><td>0.998</td><td>0.927</td></tr><tr><th>corrected (knn2d)</th><td>0.835</td><td>0.858</td><td>0.999</td><td>0.850</td></tr></tbody></table><p>(Fifth dataset SogouNews is large -- I haven't run it yet)</p><p>
These numbers would significantly change the take-away from
these experiments. For example,
for <code>KirundiNews</code>, the <code>gzip</code> method went from best-perfoming to worst-performing.</p><h4>kNN</h4><p>Their method uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm">kNN classifier</a> using k=2 (Appendix C says all experiments used k=2).</p><p>
k=2 is a bit of an odd choice for kNN classification.
For every test case, you search the training set
for the two "closest" examples. Looking at
the labels of these two, there are only two possibilities,
            </p><ul><li><i>The labels are equal.</i>
 So, this is clearly your hypothesized label.
Note that you would get the same answer for k=1.
</li><li><i>The labels are different.</i>
 We have a 1-1 tie that most be broken. There
are many ways to do a tie breaker, but one
reasonable one is take the label of the closer point.
In this case, you get the same answer for k=1.                    
</li></ul><p>

So, going from k=1 to k=2 doesn't add much information to your classifier. But, it can be different depending on the tie-breaking strategy.  
            </p><p>
It is in the case of ties that the source code
here is doing something unexpected, shown below.
            </p><h4>Code</h4><p>The issue is in <code>calc_acc</code> method in <code>experiments.py</code> [<a href="https://github.com/bazingagin/npc_gzip/blob/main/experiments.py#L88">here</a>].</p><p>Here is the relevant snippet, with my added comments, and branches dealing with <code>rand==True</code> removed for clarity:</p><div><pre><span></span><span># here, sorted_pred_lab[][] has the </span>
<span># labels and counts corresponding</span>
<span># to the top-k samples,</span>
<span>#  [[label,count],[label,count],...]</span>
<span># grouped-by label and sorted by count.</span>

<span>most_label</span> <span>=</span> <span>sorted_pred_lab</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>][</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
<span>most_count</span> <span>=</span> <span>sorted_pred_lab</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>][</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>

<span>if_right</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>for</span> <span>pair</span> <span>in</span> <span>sorted_pred_lab</span><span>:</span>
    <span># we loop until we drop below 'most_count', ie</span>
    <span># this for-loop iterates over those classes</span>
    <span># tied for highest count</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>pair</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>most_count</span><span>:</span>
        <span>break</span>

    <span># this says if ANY of those</span>
    <span># in the tied-set are equal to</span>
    <span># the test label,</span>
    <span># it is marked correct (if_right=1)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>pair</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>label</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]:</span>
        <span>if_right</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
        <span>most_label</span> <span>=</span> <span>pair</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>

<span># accumulate results:        </span>
<span>pred</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>most_label</span><span>)</span>
<span>correct</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>if_right</span><span>)</span>
        
</pre></div><p>So, if any of the tie-break labels is equal to the test label, it is marked as correct. For k=2, a tie simply means there was one vote for each of two different classes amongst the 2 closest training points. Therefore, the reported accuracies could be considered <b>top-2</b>, meaning that it's marked correct if either of the top  two choices is correct (you may have encountered top-k in ImageNet, where top-5 accuracy is often cited).</p><p>This method takes arbitrary <code>k</code> but note that it doesn't compute <code>top-k</code> for any <code>k</code>. Only in the special case of <code>k=2</code> do we have that when there is a tie, all the <code>k</code> examples are tied with the max value (1).</p><p>The <code>calc_acc</code> method has a <code>rand</code> flag that seems to be correct:  if <code>rand==True</code> it will correctly break the tie using <code>random.choice</code>. But it seems that this wasn't used for the paper results.</p><h4>Re-calc</h4><p>
I wrote a simple implementation with two
different tie-breaking strategies [<a href="https://gist.github.com/kts/46709a70c4efd167eff7ccfa62f30dd8">gist</a>]:</p><ul><li>[r] random selection</li><li>[d] decrement k until you are left with a case without ties.</li></ul><pre>Results

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="fjlPX0">Most Americans, especially those living outside of major cities, need to drive to get around, and so the need to put one’s car somewhere<em> </em>when we’re not using it — ideally somewhere safe, free, and convenient — is a quiet force that often dominates how we get around. But how parking works (or doesn’t work) is something we rarely stop to consider.</p>
<p id="P8E6aZ">Henry Grabar, a <a href="https://slate.com/author/henry-grabar">staff writer at Slate</a>, has done a lot of thinking about the issue. In his new book, <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/paved-paradise-how-parking-explains-the-world-henry-grabar/18727296?gclid=Cj0KCQjw3a2iBhCFARIsAD4jQB2l7xteDcNE8TNeMrWKJX3v-O9ve8ptpT35hMcnccBLCK9GKj8KJksaAgqNEALw_wcB"><em>Paved Paradise: How Parking Explains the World</em></a>, Grabar demonstrates in a fascinating way how parking shapes our lives in the United States, determining the kinds of homes we live in, the communities we build, and how we interact with our built environments. He shows how zoning requirements requiring off-street parking for new construction strangle new development and help fuel the affordable housing crisis. Finally, he offers a series of solutions to make our cities more affordable and livable — and to keep parking from driving us all mad.</p>
<p id="UqKfX6">This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p id="BzM1cZ"><strong>Why does parking make us so crazy?</strong></p>
<p id="fTIgDS">That is the million-dollar question. I think there are a few reasons that parking makes people really upset, but perhaps the most obvious is that in almost every place in this country, it is obligatory to have a car, and there is almost nothing that you can do without a car. So to the extent that you are able to hold down a job or go to a restaurant or pick your kids up from school, you have to drive, and parking becomes the link between driving and whatever else you want to do with your life. And so naturally, there’s a great deal of importance placed on having a good parking space.</p>
<p id="rIvAg4">That’s the first thing. And then the second one is that we have just catastrophically mismanaged the way we provide parking in this country, in a way that actually doesn’t make things better for people who are driving and parking. Parking is not shared, and it’s not properly priced. We have acquiesced to the idea that parking on city streets has to be a total free-for-all. </p>
<p id="aWbozQ"><strong>As you point out in the book, you’re not just talking about this symbolically. People have actually died over arguments about parking spots.</strong></p>
<p id="9AmoAT">Oh yeah, all the time. When I started working on this book, I set up a Google alert for “parking space murder.” So that’s been how I’ve been keeping track of this. I’m really excited to turn that Google alert off now that the reporting is done. <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/01/three-stabbings-in-nyc-kill-one-injure-two-as-2023-begins-nypd/">The first person to be killed in New York City this year was actually killed over a parking space</a>. I estimate that it happens several dozen times a year in US cities.</p>
<p id="3ZVYLp"><strong>How did you get interested in parking?</strong></p>
<p id="oRhyf9">In my work as a reporter, I was <a href="https://slate.com/author/henry-grabar">writing about cities</a>, and it seemed like every topic that I would come across had this hidden component to it that was determinative in the result of whatever was being discussed, and that issue was parking. When I went to <a href="https://slate.com/business/2018/08/houston-one-year-after-hurricane-harvey-is-at-a-crossroads.html">Houston to report on Hurricane Harvey</a>, I talked to a guy whose house had flooded for the first time, and he was saying that his house never used to flood and he was blaming it on an enormous parking lot that had been constructed and the displacement of water falling on that parking lot, and how that was contributing to the stormwater issue in his neighborhood. And this is a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/08/why-cities-flood/538251/">widespread issue in Houston</a> — the city’s brand of sprawling, auto-centric development does involve <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/article/downtown-houston-parking-one-quarter-area-17888647.php">paving over a ton of land</a>. That’s just an example.</p>
<p id="KSqpqt">Parking is really expensive, and the <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2023/04/henry-grabar-paved-paradise/">obligation to provide parking</a> can break projects that would otherwise succeed. Mass transit, the ability to create bus rapid transit lanes, or even to create bike lanes is dependent on being willing to reallocate the street parking supply. </p>
<p id="emRBn1">When you think about its spatial impact, well, cars spend 95 percent of their time parked. Parking literally takes up more room than the roads, and it costs more than the automobiles. But many of us don’t think much about parking at all, or if we do, it’s an afterthought.</p>
<p id="0rRMtX"><strong>Is the problem that we have too little parking or too much?</strong></p>
<p id="b5WCPb">I will give you an annoying answer: It depends. On a national level, certainly, there’s far more parking than we need. There are at least <a href="https://www.vox.com/a/new-economy-future/cars-cities-technologies">four parking spaces for every car</a>, meaning that the parking stock is no more than 25 percent full at any given time. And some of those cars are moving at any given time, so parking may be a good deal emptier than that. </p>
<p id="LcE6I7">Of course, there are places where people get frustrated because there isn’t enough parking. So if what you’re interested in is having a free place to park, you could look at this situation and say, well, there isn’t enough parking. In fact, that’s sort of what we did as a country: We decided, at some point in the middle of the 20th century, that there wasn’t enough parking, that this was at the root of our traffic problem, and we had to create more parking. But you can only do so at great expense, and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/parking-drives-housing-prices/618910/">at a tremendous cost to the urban fabric</a>. There may be places where there isn’t enough parking, but the solution is rarely to create more parking, but rather to more intelligently manage the parking that we have and try and find ways to control demand for parking by, for example, sharing it, pricing it, and telling people where it is. </p>
<p id="cnfrVH"><strong>What does that look like?</strong></p>
<p id="10gHCX">When somebody decides they want to open a new restaurant or open a new building, instead of saying it needs X number of spaces, we could say, let’s look at the parking stock and find accommodations that are already there. Office parking could be used at night for residential parking. That dentist’s office parking lot could become the parking lot for a restaurant. </p>
<p id="Pw5djj">The other part is pricing. If you institute a parking fee, you’ll find out exactly how many people are willing to pay to park there. If you keep raising prices until you always have spots available, you’ll find out exactly how high it needs to be to create a few open spots on every block. Because it might seem like it only takes you a couple of minutes to find a spot for free, but the net effect is thousands of miles of driving every day across the United States. There’s an unbelievable amount of driving being done just looking for parking spaces. You can look up a restaurant and look at exactly how to get there, but finding good parking is dependent on local knowledge. If you want to park downtown, you should be able to know it’s going to cost this much, and you can do it here — that should be made clear at every highway exit to downtown. But it’s not.</p>
<p id="Pkz4tv"><strong>Is the implication that parking is going to have to get more annoying in places where everyone wants to park, like busy urban commercial areas?</strong></p>
<p id="sAUQpM">I don’t think it should be more annoying. We’ve become so accustomed to the idea that you have to hunt for parking that it’s hard for people to wrap their heads around the idea that it will be easier. Yes, you’re going to have to pay for it, but no, you don’t have to stress anymore because you’ll know there’ll be a parking spot where you want it. That’s a new concept, but in the places where it’s been instituted, people seem to have found it agreeable. There is a way, even without eliminating any parking, that a little bit of management can make a smoother parking experience for everyone. Time is money, and circling around the block and not knowing when you can find a spot, or leaving 20 minutes early to find a spot to park, that’s a cost as well. </p>
<p id="5JMzNb"><strong>How does parking affect our housing supply?</strong></p>
<p id="oxnbNg">There are two principal ways that parking affects the housing supply. The first is that many jurisdictions in this country have parking requirements for new housing. That places a geometric and financial constraint on the types of things that can be built. And then what gets built contains a lot of parking, and the cost of that parking is folded into the cost of the units, whether they’re being sold or rented. And this is a pretty significant cost. In California and Arizona, it adds tens of thousands of dollars onto the cost of every new low-income housing unit. It’s folded into the rent or the asking price, whether you drive a car or not.</p>
<p id="YBYeE4">Parking functions as a third rail in neighborhood politics. The public parking supply is such a fixation that people oppose new projects, especially projects that don’t have “enough” parking, on the grounds that they’ll threaten that public parking supply, whereas if I were to say, “I don’t want poor people living in the neighborhood,” that would be considered unacceptable. I cite this survey in the book of baby boomers, and <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/modest-densification-zhar-30934/">more than half of baby boomers</a> say that free parking is more important than affordable housing in their neighborhood.  </p>
<p id="TkVFuo"><strong>How did we mess this up so bad?  </strong></p>
<p id="taRlfX">I think that parking requirements were done with the best of intentions. At its roots, it was really thought that it would solve the traffic problems in congested neighborhoods that were caused, <a href="https://time.com/6217873/parking-lots-climate-change-california/">[mid-century urban planners] thought</a>, by not having enough parking. This was the situation in American cities in the 1940s and ’50s: It was just unbelievable traffic jams, which city planners concluded were caused by the fact that there wasn’t enough parking. So lots and lots of parking was provided. The thing that they probably couldn’t have anticipated was just how thoroughly it would remake the urban environment, and how expensive it would be, and the extent to which it would begin to constrain the types of housing we could build. </p>
<p id="QObHF9">What more recent research proves is that the more parking you provide, the more people will drive, and parking is perhaps the greatest determinant of whether people decide to make a trip in a car or by some other means. So providing more parking does not actually make it easier to park. If parking actually encourages people to drive, then more parking is actually going to create more traffic, not soak up the traffic of people looking for parking.  </p>
<p id="FjV7CC"><strong>Some places have gotten rid of parking minimums, or requirements that new construction have a certain number of parking spots, in the last few years. I’m curious if you can talk a little bit about what the results have been in those communities.</strong></p>
<p id="46Dil7">There’s been a ton of movement on this in the last five years. It’s kind of amazing, dozens of cities deciding that they no longer want to require people to build a <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2021/11/22/announcing-a-new-and-improved-map-of-cities-that-have-removed-parking-minimums">certain amount of parking</a> corresponding to land use. One of the best examples is in Seattle, where in 2012 they decided to <a href="https://council.seattle.gov/2012/05/10/removing-minimum-parking-requirements-where-unneeded/">stop requiring parking for new apartment buildings around transit</a>. This was right at a period when residential construction in Seattle was booming. And they approved 60,000 units between 2012 and 2017. Most of them still have parking — I mean, developers know people who move into their buildings want space to park their cars — but they <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264837718312870?via%3Dihub">built 40 percent less parking</a> than would have been required under the old regime. And that meant they built 18,000 fewer parking spaces, and the amount of money saved from that, which we can assume went into cheaper apartments and lower rent, was $540 million: half a billion dollars saved just by not building quite so many parking spaces. </p>
<p id="1bLqYP"><strong>What else can we do? </strong></p>
<p id="2s6mVZ">If you could imagine a paradigm in which parking was a little less important, and we needed a little less of it, you can do so much with the land that we have currently reserved for parking lots. The more spectacular opportunity is with curb parking in cities, where we’ve got some of the most valuable real estate on earth, and that is really crucial in shaping people’s perception and understanding and enjoyment of the places they live in. You saw this during Covid, with the [outdoor] <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/07/streateries-outdoor-dining-architecture.html">restaurant pop-ups</a>; to even have 12 people outside sitting and having coffee on the street is just tremendous. That’s only the tip of the iceberg, right? </p>
<p id="C5p1o0">You could imagine a world in which streets were pedestrianized and where we planted trees and gardens and in what is currently space reserved for parking, and closed streets, outside schools, so kids can have places to play. I think all those things are within reach. Those aren’t even particularly expensive or ambitious ideas. They just depend on 25 car owners saying, all right, we’ll give up our rights to this little strip of land. The changes to parking on surrounding streets would probably be pretty marginal, if you consider 25 cars in neighborhood parking stock that’s probably in the thousands. </p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  The dominant text generation models compose the output by sequentially
selecting words from a fixed vocabulary. In this paper, we formulate text
generation as progressively copying text segments (e.g., words or phrases) from
an existing text collection. We compute the contextualized representations of
meaningful text segments and index them using efficient vector search toolkits.
The task of text generation is then decomposed into a series of copy-and-paste
operations: at each time step, we seek suitable text spans from the text
collection rather than selecting from a standalone vocabulary. Experiments on
the standard language modeling benchmark (WikiText-103) show that our approach
achieves better generation quality according to both automatic and human
evaluations. Besides, its inference efficiency is comparable to token-level
autoregressive models thanks to the reduction of decoding steps. We also show
that our approach allows for effective domain adaptation by simply switching to
domain-specific text collection without extra training. Finally, we observe
that our approach attains additional performance gains by simply scaling up to
larger text collections, again without further training.\footnote{Our source

<p>All too often someone, somewhere, on some forum … will lament the lack of encapsulation and isolation in the <em>C programming language</em>. This happens with such regularity that I now feel compelled to address the myth once and forever. This means I can post links to this page for any future assertion of that nature without having to retype the explanation in everytime <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">someone is wrong on the internet</a></p>
<p>Just to be clear, <em>C</em> is an old language lacking many, many, <em>many</em> modern features. One of the features it <em>does not lack</em> is encapsulation and isolation.</p>
<h2 id="myth-c-has-no-equivalent-to-private">Myth: C has no equivalent to “private”</h2>
<p>Lets look at a class definition that has <code>private</code> members; after all, that’s where the isolation comes from, right? If all the fields were public, then it’d be just like <em>C</em> but with inheritance.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>class</span> <span>StringBuilder</span> {</span>
<span id="cb2-2">   <span>private</span> <span>String</span> payload;</span>
<span id="cb2-3">   <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Append</span>(<span>String</span> snippet) {</span>
<span id="cb2-4">      payload = payload + snippet;</span>
<span id="cb2-5">   }</span>
<span id="cb2-6">};</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Any attempt by a caller to access the field <code>payload</code> results in a compilation error. Pretty nifty. You can see why this can be useful.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="https://turnoff.us/image/en/private-cloud.png" width="300" alt="PrivateWrong!"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Private Wrong, a Major Pain!</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <em>C</em> programming language doesn’t have classes<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, but it does have <code>structs</code>, which look like this:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>struct</span> StringBuilder {</span>
<span id="cb3-2">   <span>char</span> *payload;</span>
<span id="cb3-3">};</span>
<span id="cb3-4"></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><span>void</span> Append(<span>struct</span> StringBuilder *obj, <span>const</span> <span>char</span> *snippet);</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are no access modifiers; all fields in a struct are public. This is why there is always someone complaining that <em>C</em> doesn’t provide encapsulation or isolation: everything is visible in a struct, to everyone, all the time, even the callers of the function <code>Append()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="reality-bytes">Reality bytes</h2>
<p>The complaint isn’t necessarily true. While you <em>can indeed</em> dump everything into a single source file and call it a day, the more common option is to split things into different files and modules.</p>
<p>When code is in different source files, they <em>are</em> are encapsulated into a <em>module</em>. Each <em>“module”</em> in <em>C</em> consists of an interface file which callers can use to call functions which exist in the implementation file.</p>
<p>The interface file, called the <strong>header file</strong> (with a file extension of <code>.h</code>) is a <strong>contract</strong> that tells the user of the module what functions and types are needed to use the implementation, frequently simply called the <strong>source file</strong>. After compilation, you might have a compiled <strong>implementation</strong>, and thus may not even have access to the source code of <code>Append()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="and-ta-da">And … Ta Da!</h2>
<p>The calling programs <strong>have</strong> to use the <em>header file</em> in order to make legal (under <em>C</em>) calls to <code>Append()</code>; the implementation might only be available in compiled form, after all, and not source code form.</p>
<p>So, in the header you do:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> StringBuilder StringBuilder;</span>
<span id="cb4-2"></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><span>void</span> Append(StringBuilder *obj, <span>const</span> <span>char</span> *snippet);</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the implementation you do:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>struct</span> StringBuilder {</span>
<span id="cb5-2">   <span>char</span> *payload;</span>
<span id="cb5-3">};</span>
<span id="cb5-4"></span>
<span id="cb5-5"><span>void</span> Append(StringBuilder *obj, <span>const</span> <span>char</span> *snippet)</span>
<span id="cb5-6">{</span>
<span id="cb5-7">   ...</span>
<span id="cb5-8">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And … that’s <em>it!</em></p>
<p>Now any code using a struct of type <code>StringBuilder</code> can use it all they want to build up a string, but they can never see the fields within it.</p>
<p>Hell, they cannot even <code>malloc()</code> their own <code>StringBuilder</code> instance, because even the size of the <code>StringBuilder</code> is hidden. They have to use creation and deletion functions provided in the implementation as specified in the interface.</p>
<h2 id="but-theres-more">But, there’s more …</h2>
<p>So now you have a way to create an instance of an object with all its fields hidden from any caller. You have also forced all callers to stop messing about with the fields in your object - all access to the object is guarded by the functions in the implementation (as specified in the header).</p>
<p>You don’t have inheritance, but you <em>do</em> have one very important characteristic: you can create objects from this class, and use them, from within Python.</p>
<p>Or PHP.</p>
<p>Ruby, even.</p>
<p>It’ll work with most Lisp implementations.</p>
<p>You can call it from Java.</p>
<p>In fact, I don’t believe there is a single programming language in common use which <em>cannot</em> use this object. In many cases the programmer from the other language won’t even have to do much work to use this class.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>]</p>
<p>My <code>Makefiles</code> already have rules to <strong>automatically</strong> generate the interface so that the <em>C</em> code I write in this manner is callable from within Android applications.</p>
<h2 id="you-got-it-ill-stop-now">You got it, I’ll stop now</h2>
<p>And that’s how you get encapsulation and isolation with strong guarantees in <em>C</em>. Don’t believe everything you read on the internet.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">What does one expect from a website builder in 2023? That’s the question many startups — and incumbents — are trying to answer as the landscape changes, driven by trends in generative AI. Do no-code drag-and-drop interfaces still make sense in an era of prompts and media-generating models? And what’s the right level of abstraction that won’t alienate more advanced users?</p>
<p>Wix, a longtime fixture of the web building space, is betting that today’s customers don’t particularly care to spend time customizing every aspect of their site’s appearance.</p>
<p>The company’s new AI Site Generator tool, announced today, will let Wix users describe their intent and generate a website complete with a homepage, inner pages and text and images — as well as business-specific sections for events, bookings and more. Avishai Abrahami, Wix’s co-founder and CEO, says that the goal was to provide customers with “real value” as they build their sites and grow their businesses.</p>
<p>“The AI Site Generator leverages our domain expertise and near-decade of experience with AI to tune the models to generate high-quality content, tailor-made design and layouts,” Abrahami said. “We’ve conducted many tests and have had many in-depth conversations with users to be confident that we are delivering real value. That’s why we chose to do it now.”</p>
<div id="attachment_2569594"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2569594" decoding="async" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ezgif-1-2d58eb307d.gif" alt="Wix AI site generator" width="600" height="338"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2569594"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Wix</p></div>
<p>AI Site Generator might be Wix’s most ambitious AI experiment to date, but it’s not the company’s first. Wix’s recently launched text creator taps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a> to give users the ability to generate personalized content for particular sections of a website. Meanwhile, its AI template text creator generates all the text for a given site. There’s also the AI domain generator for brainstorming web domain names, which sits alongside Wix’s suite of AI image editing, fine-tuning and creation tools.</p>
<p>The way Abrahami tells it, Wix isn’t jumping on AI because it’s the Silicon Valley darling of the moment. He sees the tech as a genuine way to streamline and simplify the process of building back-end business functionality, infrastructure, payments capabilities and more for customers’ websites.</p>
<div id="attachment_2569603"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2569603" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ezgif-1-ceeefa582b.gif" alt="Wix AI site generator" width="600" height="338"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2569603"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Wix</p></div>
<p>To Abrahami’s point, small businesses in particular struggle to launch and maintain sites, potentially causing them to miss income opportunities. A 2022 <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/27-of-small-businesses-still-dont-have-a-website-in-2022-301542302.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a> by Top Design Firms, a directory for finding creative agencies, found that nearly 27% of small businesses still don’t have a website and that low traffic, followed by adding “advanced” functionalities and cost, are the top challenges they face with their website.</p>
<p>AI Site Generator takes several prompts — any descriptions of sites — and uses a combination of in-house and third-party AI systems to create the envisioned site. In a chatbot-like interface, the tool asks a series of questions about the nature of the site and business, attempting to translate this into a custom web template.</p>
<p>ChatGPT generates the text for the website while Wix’s AI creates the site design and images.</p>
<p>Other platforms, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/07/speedybrand-generative-ai-marketing/">SpeedyBrand</a>, which TechCrunch recently profiled, already accomplish something this. But Wix claims that AI Site Generator is unique in that it can build in e-commerce, scheduling, food ordering and event ticketing components automatically, depending on a customer’s specs and requirements.</p>
<div id="attachment_2569600"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2569600" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ezgif-1-b0517e68cb.gif" alt="Wix AI site generator" width="600" height="338"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2569600"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Wix</p></div>
<p>“With AI Site Generator, users will be able to create a complete website, where the design fits the content, as opposed to a template where the content fits the design,” Abrahami said. “This generates a unique website that maximizes the experience relevant to the content.”</p>
<p>Customers aren’t constrained to AI Site Generator’s designs, a not-so-subtle acknowledgement that AI isn’t at the point where it can replace human designers — assuming it ever gets there. The full suite of Wix’s editing tools — both manual and AI-driven — is available to AI Site Generator users, letting them make tweaks and changes as they see fit.</p>
<p>New capabilities focused on editing will arrive alongside AI Site Generator, too, like an AI page and section creator that’ll enable customers to add a new page or section to a site simply by describing their needs. The forthcoming object eraser will let users extract objects from images and manipulate them, while the new AI assistant tool will suggest site improvements (e.g. adding a product or changing a design) and create personalized strategies based on analytics and site trends.</p>
<div id="attachment_2569593"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2569593" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ezgif-1-3df1f254b3.gif" alt="Wix assistant" width="600" height="338"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2569593"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Wix</p></div>
<p>“The current AI revolution is just beginning to unleash AI’s true potential,” Abrahami said. “We believe AI can reduce complexity and create value for our users, and we will continue to be trailblazers.”</p>
<p>But there’s reason to be wary of the tech.</p>
<p>As The Verge’s James Vincent wrote in a recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/26/23773914/ai-large-language-models-data-scraping-generation-remaking-web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">piece</a>, generative AI models are changing the economy of the web — making it cheaper and easier to generate lower-quality content. Newsguard, a company that provides tools for vetting news sources, has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2023/06/29/the-predictable-rise-of-generative-ai-spam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exposed</a>&nbsp;hundreds of ad-supported sites with generic-sounding names featuring misinformation created with generative AI.</p>
<p>Cheap AI content also risks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/2/19063562/ai-text-generation-spam-marketing-seo-fractl-grover-google" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clogging up</a> search engines — a future small businesses almost certainly don’t want. Models such as ChatGPT excel at crafting search engine-friendly marketing copy. But this spam can often bury legitimate sites, particularly sites created by those without the means or know-how to optimize their content with the right keywords and schema.</p>
<p>Even generative AI used with the best intentions can go awry. Thanks to a phenomenon known as “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/19/stability-ai-releases-chatgpt-like-language-models/">hallucination</a>,” AI models sometimes confidently make up facts or spew <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/12/researchers-discover-a-way-to-make-chatgpt-consistently-toxic/">toxic, wildly offensive</a> remarks. And <span>generative AI has been shown to <a href="https://www.unite.ai/ai-based-generative-writing-models-frequently-copy-and-paste-source-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plagiarize</a> copyrighted work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>So what steps is Wix taking to combat all this? Abrahami didn’t say specifically. But he stressed that Wix uses a “bevy” of tools to&nbsp;manage spam and abuse.</p>
<p>“Our AI solutions are tried and tested on large-scale quality data and we leverage the knowledge gained from usage and building workflows across hundreds of millions of websites,” Abrahami said. “We have many models, including AI, that prevent and detect model abuse because we believe in creating a safe digital space where the fundamental rights of users are protected. ChatGPT has an inherent model to prevent inappropriate content generation; we plan to use OpenAI’s moderation.”</p>
<p>Time will tell how successful that strategy ends up being.</p>

<blockquote> 
<p>"we analyze a large dataset of citations from Wikipedia and model the role of open access in Wikipedia's citation patterns. We find that open-access articles are extensively and increasingly more cited in Wikipedia. What is more, they show a 15% higher likelihood of being cited in Wikipedia when compared to closed-access articles, after controlling for confounding factors. This open-access citation effect is particularly strong for articles with low citation counts, including recently published ones. Our results show that open access plays a key role in the dissemination of scientific knowledge, including by providing Wikipedia editors timely access to novel results."

<p>This article is a first draft of an analysis of the relationship between the availability of a scientific journal as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access" title="Open access">open access</a> and the fact that it is cited in the English Wikipedia (note: although it speaks of "Wikipedia", the article looks only at the English pages). It is a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed, so its results should be read with caution, especially since I am not sure about the robustness of the model and the results derived from it (see below). It is of course a very important issue, as access to scientific sources is key to the diffusion of scientific knowledge, but also, as the authors mention, because Wikipedia is seen as central to the diffusion of scientific facts (and is sometimes used by scientists to push their ideas).

<p>The results presented in the article (and its abstract) highlight two important issues for Wikipedia that will likely be addressed in a more complete version of the paper:
</p>
<ul><li>The question of the reliability of the sources used by Wikipedians</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>→ The regressions seem to indicate that the reputation of the journal is not important to be cited in Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>→ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_journals" title="Predatory journals">Predatory journals</a> are known to be more often open access than classical journals, which means that this result potentially indicates that the phenomenon of open access reduces the seriousness of Wikipedia sources.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>The authors say on p. 4 that they provided "each journal with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCImago_Journal_Rank" title="SCImago Journal Rank">SJR score</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index" title="H-index">H-index</a>, and other relevant information."
Why did they not use this as a control variable?
(this echoes a debate on the role of Wikipedia: is it to disseminate verified knowledge, or to serve as a platform for the dissemination of new theories? The authors seem to lean towards the second view: p. 2: "With the rapid development of the Internet, traditional peer review and journal publication can no longer meet the need for the development of new ideas".)
</p>
<ul><li>The solidity of the paper's conclusions</li></ul>
<dl><dd>The authors said: "STEM fields, especially biology and medicine, comprise the most prominent scientific topics in Wikipedia [17]." "General science, technology, and biomedical research have relatively higher OA rates."
<dl><dd>→ So, it is obvious that, on average, there are more citations of Open Access articles in Wikipedia (than in the entire available research corpus), and explain that open access articles are cited more.</dd>
<dd>→ Why not control for academic discipline in the models?</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>More problematic (and acknowledged by the authors, so probably in the process of being addressed), the authors said, on p.7, that they built their model with the assumption that the age of a research article and the number of citations it has both influence the probability of an article being cited in Wikipedia.
Of course, for this causal effect to hold, the age and the number of citations must be taken into account at the moment the article is cited in Wikipedia. For example, if some of the citations are made after the citation in Wikipedia, one could argue that the causal effect could be in the other direction.
Also, many articles are open access after an embargo period, and are therefore considered open access in the analysis, whereas they may have been cited in Wikipedia when they were under embargo.
The authors did not check for this, as acknowledged in the last sentence of the article. Would their result hold if they do their model taking the first citation in the English Wikipedia, for example, and the age of the article, its open access status, etc. at that moment?

<p>Although this first draft is probably not solid enough to be cited in Wikipedia, it signals important research in progress, and I am sure that the richness of the data and the quality of the team will quickly lead to very interesting insights for the Wikipedia community.

</p>
<blockquote><p> 
This study investigates the development of historical revisionism on Wikipedia. The edit history of Wikipedia pages allows us to trace the dynamics of individuals and coordinated groups surrounding controversial topics. This project focuses on Japan, where there has been a recent increase in right-wing discourse and dissemination of different interpretations of historical events.</p></blockquote>
<p>This brief study, one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_abstract" title="Extended abstract">extended abstracts</a> accepted at the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://wikiworkshop.org/2023/">Wiki Workshop (10th edition)</a>, follows up on reports that some historical pages on the Japanese Wikipedia, particularly those related to World War II and war crimes, have been edited in ways that reflect radical right-wing ideas (see previous <i>Signpost</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2021-03-28/In_the_media" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2021-03-28/In the media">coverage</a>). It sets out to answer three questions: 
</p>
<ol><li>What types of historical topics are most susceptible to historical revisionism?</li>
<li>What are the common factors for the historical topics that are subject to revisionism?</li>
<li>Are there groups of editors who are seeking to disseminate revisionist narratives?</li></ol>
<p>The study focuses on the level of controversy of historical articles, based on the notion that the introduction of revisionism is likely to lead to edit wars. The authors found that the most controversial historical articles in the Japanese Wikipedia were indeed focused on areas that are of particular interest to revisionists. From the findings:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Articles related to WWII exhibited significantly greater controversy than general historical articles. Among the top 20 most controversial articles, eleven were largely related to Japanese war crimes and right-wing ideology. Over time, the number of contributing editors and the level of controversy increased. Furthermore, editors involved in edit wars were more likely to contribute to a higher number of controversial articles, particularly those related to right-wing ideology. These findings suggest the possible presence of groups of editors seeking to disseminate revisionist narratives.</p></blockquote> 
<p>The paper establishes that articles covering these topic areas in the Japanese Wikipedia are contested and subject to edit wars. However, it does not measure to what extent article content has been compromised. Edit wars could be a sign of mainstream editors pushing back against revisionists, while conversely an absence of edit wars could indicate that a project has been captured (cf. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_Wikipedia" title="Croatian Wikipedia">Croatian Wikipedia</a>). While this little paper is a useful start, further research on the Japanese Wikipedia seems warranted.

<p>This preprint<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> (by three graduate students at Stanford University's computer science department and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_S._Lam" title="Monica S. Lam">Monica S. Lam</a> as fourth author) discusses the construction of a Wikipedia-based chatbot:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We design WikiChat [...] to ground LLMs using Wikipedia to achieve the following objectives. While LLMs tend to hallucinate, our chatbot should be factual. While introducing facts to the conversation, we need to maintain the qualities of LLMs in being relevant, conversational, and engaging."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paper sets out from the observation that
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"LLMs cannot speak accurately about events that occurred after their training, which are often topics of great interest to users, and [...] are highly prone to hallucination when talking about less popular (tail) topics. [...] Through many iterations of experimentation, we have crafted a pipeline based on information retrieval that (1) uses LLMs to suggest interesting and relevant facts that are individually verified against Wikipedia, (2) retrieves additional up-to-date information, and (3) composes coherent and engaging time-aware responses. [...] We focus on evaluating important but previously neglected issues such as conversing about recent and tail topics. We find that WikiChat outperforms all baselines in terms of the factual accuracy of its claims, by up to 12.1%, 28.3% and 32.7% on head, recent and tail topics, while matching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3.5" title="GPT-3.5">GPT-3.5</a> in terms of providing natural, relevant, non-repetitive and informational responses."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The researchers argue that "most chatbots are evaluated only on static crowdsourced benchmarks like Wizard of Wikipedia (Dinan et al., 2019) and Wizard of Internet (Komeili et al., 2022). Even when human evaluation is used, evaluation is conducted only on familiar discussion topics. This leads to an overestimation of the capabilities of chatbots." They call such topics "head topics" ("Examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona" title="FC Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>"). In  contrast, the lesser known "tail topics [are] likely to be present in the pre-training data of LLMs at low frequency. Examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Percy_Hilditch" title="Thomas Percy Hilditch">Thomas Percy Hilditch</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Kitchen_Suomi" title="Hell's Kitchen Suomi">Hell's Kitchen Suomi</a>". As a third category, they consider "recent topics" ("topics that happened in 2023, and therefore are absent from the pre-training corpus of LLMs, even though some background information about them could be present. Examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spare_(memoir)" title="Spare (memoir)"><i>Spare</i> (memoir)</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Australian_Open" title="2023 Australian Open">2023 Australian Open</a>"). The latter are obtained from a list of most edited Wikipedia articles in early 2023. 
</p><p>Regarding the "core verification problem [...] whether a claim is backed up by the retrieved paragraphs [the researchers] found that there is a significant gap between LLMs (even GPT-4) and human performance [...]. Therefore, we conduct human evaluation via crowdsourcing, to classify each claim as supported, refuted, or [not having] enough information." (This observation may be of interest regarding efforts to use LLMs as a tools for Wikipedians to check the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:TSI" title="Wikipedia:TSI">integrity of citations on Wikipedia</a>.

</p><p>In contrast, the evalution for "conversationality" is conducted "with simulated users using LLMs. LLMs are good at simulating users: they have the general familiarity with world knowledge and know how users behave socially. They are free to occasionally hallucinate, make mistakes, and repeat or even contradict themselves, as human users sometimes do."
</p><p>In the paper's evaluation, WikiChat impressively outperforms the two comparison baselines in all three topic areas (even the well-known "head" topics).

The Foundation describes it as an experiment designed answer research questions such as "whether users of AI assistants like ChatGPT are interested in getting summaries of verifiable knowledge from Wikipedia".
</p><p>The plugin works by first performing a Google site search on Wikipedia to find articles matching the user's query, and then passing the first few paragraphs of each article's text to ChatGPT, together with additional (hidden) <a href="https://gitlab.wikimedia.org/repos/machine-learning/chatgpt-plugin/-/blob/dev/app/prompt_constants.py">instruction prompts</a> on how the assistant should use them to generate an answer for the user (e.g. "In ALL responses, Assistant MUST always link to the Wikipedia articles used").

<blockquote><p> 
"Large Language Models (LLMs) may hallucinate and generate fake information, despite pre-training on factual data. Inspired by the journalistic device of 'according to sources', we propose according-to prompting: directing LLMs to ground responses against previously observed text. To quantify this grounding, we propose a novel evaluation metric (QUIP-Score) that measures the extent to which model-produced answers are directly found in underlying text corpora. We illustrate with experiments on Wikipedia that these prompts improve grounding under our metrics, with the additional benefit of often improving end-task performance."</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors tested various variations of such "grounding prompts" (e.g. "As an expert editor for Wikipedia, I am confident in the following answer." or "I found some results for that on Wikipedia. Here’s a direct quote:"). The best performing prompt was "Respond to this question using only information that can be attributed to Wikipedia".

We collect sentences in Wikipedia that cite one or more webpages and annotate whether the content on those pages entails those sentences. Negative examples arise naturally, from slight misinterpretation of text to minor aspects of the sentence that are not attested in the evidence. Our annotations are over sub-sentence units of the hypothesis, decomposed automatically by GPT-3, each of which is labeled with a subset of evidence sentences from the source document. We show that real claims in our dataset involve challenging verification problems, and we benchmark existing approaches on this dataset.

<p>"we introduce the novel task of automatically generating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Short_description" title="Wikipedia:Short description">short descriptions for Wikipedia articles and</a> propose Descartes, a multilingual model for tackling it. Descartes integrates three sources of information to generate an article description in a target language: the text of the article in all its language versions, the already-existing descriptions (if any) of the article in other languages, and semantic type information obtained from a knowledge graph. We evaluate a Descartes model trained for handling 25 languages simultaneously, showing that it beats baselines (including a strong translation-based baseline) and performs on par with monolingual models tailored for specific languages. A human evaluation on three languages further shows that the quality of Descartes’s descriptions is largely indistinguishable from that of human-written descriptions; e.g., 91.3% of our English descriptions (vs. 92.1% of human-written descriptions) pass the bar for inclusion in Wikipedia, suggesting that Descartes is ready for production, with the potential to support human editors in filling a major gap in today’s Wikipedia across languages."

<p>From the introduction:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"With the rapid development of Wikipedia and Wikidata in recent years, the editor community has been overloaded with contributing new information adapting to user requirements, and patrolling the massive content daily. Hence, the application of NLP and deep learning is key to solving these problems effectively. In this paper, we propose a summarization approach trained on WikiDes that generates missing descriptions in thousands of Wikidata items, which reduces human efforts and boosts content development faster. The summarizer is responsible for creating descriptions while humans toward a role in patrolling the text quality instead of
starting everything from the beginning. Our work can be scalable to multilingualism, which takes a more positive impact on user experiences in searching for articles by short descriptions in many Wikimedia projects."

<p>From the paper:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In this PhD project, leveraging the Wikidata Knowledge base, we aim to provide empirical evidence as well as theoretical grounding to address the following questions:
</p>
<dl><dd>RQ1) How can we measure the information gap between different language editions of Wikipedia?</dd>
<dd>RQ2) What are the sources of the cross-lingual information gap in Wikipedia?</dd></dl>
<p>[...]<br>
The results revealed a correlation between stronger similarities [...] and languages spoken in countries with established historical or geographical connections, such as Russian/Ukrainian, Czech/Polish, and Spanish/Catalan."

<blockquote> 
<p>"Priority conflicts and the attribution of contributions to important scientific breakthroughs to individuals and groups play an important role in science, its governance, and evaluation.[....] Our objective is to transform Wikipedia into an accessible, traceable primary source for analyzing such debates. In this paper, we introduce Webis-WikiSciTech-23, a new corpus consisting of science and technology Wikipedia articles, focusing on the identification of their history sections. [...] The identification of passages covering the historical development of innovations is achieved by combining heuristics for section heading analysis and classifiers trained on a ground truth of articles with designated history sections."

It’s a mental warm-up, a way of occupying my brain when I don’t want to mindlessly scroll.</span></p><p><span>Along the way, I came across a fantastic book called </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Super-GM-Michael-Adams/dp/1784831670" rel="">Think Like A Super-GM</a><span>, by Michael Adams and Philip Hurtado. The authors take 100 or so chess puzzles, of varying difficulty, and then ask chess players of different skill levels (amateur to grandmaster) to solve them, </span><em>while recording their thinking process out loud</em><span>. </span></p></div><div><p><span>It turns out comparing the thought process of less skilled vs. more skilled players gives you many useful insights! (I’d love to see this concept used for books in other disciplines.)</span></p><p><span>The lesson I found the most striking is this: </span><strong>there’s a direct correlation between how skilled you are as a chess player, and how much time you spend falsifying your ideas</strong><span>. The authors find that grandmasters spend longer falsifying their idea for a move than they do coming up with the move in the first place, whereas amateur players tend to identify a solution and then play it shortly after without trying their hardest to falsify it first. (Often amateurs, find reasons </span><em>for</em><span> playing the move -- ‘hope chess’.)</span></p><p><span>Call this the ‘falsification ratio’: the ratio of time you spend trying to falsify your idea to the time you took coming up with it in the first place. For grandmasters, this is 4:1 — they’ll spend 1 minute finding the right move, and another 4 minutes trying to falsify it, whereas for amateurs this is something like 0.5:1 — 1 minute finding the move, 30 seconds making a cursory effort to falsify it. </span></p><p><span>This is a really interesting finding!</span></p><p><span>Let me explain with an example.

Note: the puzzle is rated advanced, and a 2000 ELO person got it wrong in the book).</span></p><p><span>Here is the difference between an amateur and a good player:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The amateur: “Huh, f7 seems weak, what if I attack it again? Bd5 does that. Ok, so Bd5 and next move I play Qf7+. That’s </span><em>got</em><span> to be winning”. At this point the amateur will conclude they’ve solved the puzzle. (Note that they didn’t consider the opponent’s move at all.)</span></p><p><span>The good player: “Ok, I notice f7’s weak. Let me analyse Bd5. What’s the strongest reply — can I prove this wrong somehow? What would I play if I were Black? Oh wow, there’s Bxh4! Now if gxh4 then Black has a perpetual check (repeat Qg4 - Qd1 forever), and it’s a draw.” </span></p><p><span>Note that the good player hits on a potential right answer but immediately dives into </span><em>trying their hardest to prove it wrong, as though they were the opponent</em><span>, and they find that Bd5 leads to a draw (not a win). This leads them to the correct answer, which in this case is Qd7 -- this covers the g4 square, so that now if black plays Bxh4 white can safely recapture the bishop without worrying about perpetual check.</span></p><p><span>This skill of finding the best move for your opponent turns out to be very hard in practice. [1]</span></p><p><strong>2.</strong></p><p><span>It’s hard in real life, too: vanishingly few people are meta-rational enough to try </span><em>really hard to falsify their own ideas</em><span>. Your brain really wants to find reasons to support what you believe. It’s an unfamiliar and strange mental motion to invert that, and find the strongest arguments </span><em>against</em><span> your own beliefs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But this isn’t a catch-all trick. There are important disanalogies to this in life, too. Many scenarios in life have the following properties:</span></p><p><span>(1) You have to “try it and see”; there aren’t definitive, computable answers</span><br><span>(2) Your degree of belief partially determines how successful you are</span></p><p><span>For example, should you launch that risky project - say, a startup? </span></p><p><span>If you spend 1 hour coming up with the idea and 4 hours coming up with reasons not to pursue it… chances are you’ll probably find some compelling-seeming reason why you shouldn’t bother. </span></p><p><span>The most effective people seem to be good at accepting the dissonance and going forward with things anyway (after thinking rigorously about them!), knowing that you can always find reasons why a thing won’t work. I think startups are an example of #2: your success is partially determined by how much conviction you have.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The “you have to try it and see” property is also counter-intuitive; it implies that your initial idea often doesn’t matter </span><em>except as a starting point</em><span>. This concept is often taken to mean “ideas don’t matter”, which is not what I’m saying here. It’s more like: the idea determines what maze you’re exploring, which is important — if you start out trying to find a cure for diabetes you’re unlikely to end up working on a payroll SaaS company, for example — but it’s going to </span><em>change</em><span> as you go along and learn more about reality.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This is another area where I find that the personality of founders diverges from some smart engineers or scientists I’ve known: the scientist/engineers are good at analyzing the idea and finding reasons it </span><em>won’t</em><span> work (witness the negative Hacker News comments in virtually every successful startup launch, e.g. </span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8863" rel="">Dropbox</a><span>), because that’s how they’re trained to think. This skeptical mindset is adaptive in the engineering and science context — you have to find all the weak points in a system or theory, or else you’re not doing your job right. </span></p><p><span>It’s not as simple as “founders are optimists, scientists are skeptics”, though. I once asked a few founder friends what they’d have told themselves about startups, and the most common one was that </span><em>you know when something isn’t working way before you’re actually able to admit it to yourself</em><span>, and it’s best to save yourself time by admitting that it’s not working sooner, cutting your losses, and iterating quicker. You want the cycle time</span><em> </em><span>to be as fast as possible: the more cycles, the higher your chances of success overall. [2]</span></p><p><strong>3.</strong><span> </span></p><p><em>Conviction that there is an answer.</em><span> There’s a cruelty to problem-solving: if you are solving exercises that are collected in a book, it’s implicit that each of those problems has a solution. Puzzle books are a forgiving problem-solving environment in that way. It means that you can bang your head against the problem for hours, because you know that there is a findable answer, and that you will find it if you simply apply enough determination and search hard enough. Unlike real life, where you have to try it (and sometimes waste a lot of time).</span></p><p><span>This lesson hit home when I was trying the following problem from Larson’s book, “Problem Solving Through Problems” which is a collection of math problems (mostly Putnam or Olympiad): </span></p></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png" width="1236" height="250" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:250,&quot;width&quot;:1236,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b53384f-5eae-44ee-9310-8045d325e57f_1236x250.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><div><p><span> I beat my head against this one for ages, and couldn’t find any traction.

I started playing around with the 8s, noting that 8*8 (=64) contains a 6.

It recurs infinitely! And it contains a 6! QED. But I’m not sure I’d have found this without the conviction that there </span><em>was</em><span> a possible solution (otherwise, why would Larson have included it in the book?).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Real life is not this clean; frequently you dive into an idea maze and the answer turns out to be “it’s too hard for these structural reasons, and unless you fix these structural reasons there isn’t a sufficiently scalable thing here” or something like that — this seems to be the fate of a lot of startups that tackle sectors like education or health, for example. This can be painful and suck up years of people’s lives.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This is why I think of founders and scientists as courageous in precisely the same way: they are driven by a faith that there’s a findable answer there, and they’re willing to dash themselves against the rocks and risk failure to get to that answer. And in many cases it turns out that there </span><em>isn’t</em><span> one, at least not by the paths of the maze that they’ve been exploring. </span></p><p><strong>4.</strong><span> </span></p><p><span>I think of this when reading </span><a href="https://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/THEM00092" rel="">Newton’s notebooks</a><span>. They’re not structured, they’re more him writing down questions about literally everything, and sketching out little proofs / thoughts. </span></p><p><span>They’re breathtaking – the sheer diversity of questions he asks, and the audacious scope of his conjectures. And what’s striking is he wonders – profusely – about very small physical things that a child might wonder about (I modernized the spelling):</span></p></div><ul><li><p>“Why is breath or sweat seen in winter more than in summer”</p></li><li><p>“Why water is clearer than Vapors”</p></li><li><p>“Why flints do break upon a soft thing sooner than a hard one”</p></li><li><p>“Why does water freeze first &amp; most next the Air”</p></li></ul><p>-- but in between these very physical questions are questions of much grander scope, like:</p><ul><li><p>Whether the soul is immortal</p></li><li><p>What the first matter would have consisted of</p></li><li><p>“Whether Moses his saying in Gen the 1st that the evening &amp; the morning were the first day etc. do prove that God created time.”</p></li></ul><div><p><span>It feels weird to read these intertwined, since they seem like very different kinds of question to us. But this is only because we know that the physical questions are answerable in terms of science (because we have pretty good answers to them now -- often thanks to Newton!), and the second type of question isn’t, at least as far as we know. </span></p><p><span>But it’s possible that from Newton’s perspective, both of these kind of questions were </span><em>equally</em><span> mysterious, and for all he knew he could find answers to </span><em>both</em><span> kinds by trying really hard! [3] Before Newton, maybe people were </span><em>more</em><span> confident about the theological questions – (“yes, obviously the soul is immortal”) – than about the physical kind – (“well, I have no idea what makes the planets move!”). Newton made the mysterious banal.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>5.</strong></p><p><span>Another thing I’m struck by, in puzzles, is the role of </span><em>really wanting to know the answer.</em><span> You might say, facetiously, that a scientist is someone who really wants to know the answer, to a degree that is pathological (and maladaptive) to a normal person. (Elsewhere I referred to this trait as the ‘</span><a href="https://nabeelqu.co/understanding" rel="">will to think</a><span>’, after Shockley).</span></p><p><span>Complacency afflicts us all, to some extent. Solving chess puzzles makes this blindingly clear, because how good you are at them is inversely related to how complacent you are. Our brains want to stop thinking as soon as possible, probably because thinking hard takes up </span><em>a lot of energy</em><span> and if you didn’t curb that impulse… well, you’d get a very impractical scientist or a mathematician, who spent all their time lost in thought. For most of us, you have to </span><em>actively fight</em><span> complacency, which comes in the form of “yeah this answer seems good enough”.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There’s a striking passage in Jonathan Rowson’s book “</span><a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Chess-Zebras-Thinking-Differently-about/dp/1901983854" rel="">Chess for Zebras</a><span>” where he’s tutoring a student on a puzzle. The student gets the ideas in the puzzle, but doesn’t quite make the leap to the answer. The tutor gets frustrated, because he knows the student </span><em>can</em><span> get to the answer (paraphrased):&nbsp;</span></p></div><blockquote><div><p><span>Tutor: No. You were sort of right about shortcomings. You see this position is about problem-solving, as most chess is. You have to be really persistent if you want to get somewhere...</span></p><p><span>[Student says something about needing to improve on board vision]</span></p><p><span>Tutor: Well, to be honest, I think you have that. You can see that White has more space, the better bishop, etc. And you can see that you need to get the king in ... thus far you are up there with the best. You also notice that Bxg6 is an issue. </span></p><p><span>Student: But it’s how to do it! </span></p><p><span>Me: Well that’s what we are on about here. </span><strong>What stops you, I think, is a combination of not really believing you’ll get it and not really caring. Is that too harsh – or is it somewhere close to the truth?</strong></p></div></blockquote><div><p><span>Complacency hits especially hard in king and pawn endgames, when king moves that seem “good enough” can in fact be losing or drawing, and you really have to calculate each and every move very exactly to figure out a win. You have to be </span><em>unreasonably thorough</em><span> and check every single move, to a degree that seems quite pedantic. [4]</span></p><p><span>I notice this in people who are good at science, too: they are really, really thorough and check every edge case.</span></p><p><span>This tendency can, again, be maladaptive in some context. I’ve noticed that sometimes good scientists have trouble when cast into more CEO-like / founder-like roles, including things like:</span></p></div><ul><li><p>Going down ‘rabbit holes’, i.e. getting super interested in one particular aspect of the business to the exclusion of all else</p></li><li><p>Difficulty in making themselves interested in “less interesting” problems (e.g. sales, operations), resulting in e.g. mismanagement of finances because they weren’t willing to get into the weeds of the ‘boring’ area</p></li><li><p>Wanting more information before making a decision than it’s possible to really get and moving too slowly as a result</p></li></ul><div><p><span>I think this is a consequence of what I’ll call “scientist-brain” vs. “founder-brain”. (Yes, I’m generalizing, many exceptions exist and it’s not this clean in real life.)</span></p><p><span>Scientist-brain is unreasonably thorough and wants to check every single case; is very curious about things and willing to follow that curiosity, but doesn’t have a natural check on this process; and prefers working on things that are interesting to them, finding it extremely painful if this is not the case. This is </span><em>great</em><span> when you are doing science, because you need the ‘driver’ to be curiosity, and small details matter. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But it’s often bad in CEO or founder type roles, where you often need to move fast, decide based on imperfect information, maintain context on 10+ workstreams including sometimes intellectually boring ones, and above all not go down rabbit holes unless they’re super critical to the business. The tragedy of CEO roles is that you’re often not spending much time on the most interesting things at all.</span></p><p><span>(This is also why CEOs/founders want you to be terse in communication and give them the bottom line up front. CEOs are holding so much in their heads already that unnecessary details have a high marginal cost.)</span></p><p><span>Again, these are very, very broad generalizations! And there are some very successful scientist-founders. But I think these are two very different archetypes, and paired together they often make a stellar team.</span></p><p><strong>6.</strong></p><p><span>Chess players usually end up converging on a consistent thought process for every move. [5] Thought process is useful, and it’s often helpful to have a laundry list of these techniques to apply to the problem at hand. But it’s not as if giving you the thought process is magically going to lead you to the right answer.</span></p><p><span>One constraint you run up against hard when doing chess puzzles is</span><strong> </strong><span>working memory. The more context you have to hold in your head, the harder it is to make more calculations. </span></p><p><span>Once, frustrated by my accuracy rate, I decided to allow myself to use a scratch Google Docs page to record all my calculations, as an exercise. My accuracy shot up; I rarely got anything wrong. Being able to write things down freed up ‘mental scratchpad’ space, which made my calculations more accurate overall, and made it easier to check I hadn’t missed anything. [6]</span></p><p><span>I’m pretty sure people who are great at chess have better working memory than people who aren’t. And it seems like working memory is innate and fixed, though I’d welcome any counter-evidence. [7]&nbsp;Indeed, Adams and Hurtado find that grandmasters have better intuition and identify the right answer very quickly; they calculate far quicker and more accurately than amateurs; in general, it seems that visualizing and thinking far ahead is much easier for them than the amateurs, the result of thousands of hours of practice and probably innate talent. I think this is clearly true of math too: more gifted people traverse the maze faster, and seem to have a preternatural instinct for what’s going to turn out to be a blind alley versus what’s not. </span></p><p><span>I’ve always been struck by Jonathan Rowson’s account of playing Grischuk, a super-grandmaster, and analyzing the game together with him afterwards:</span></p></div><blockquote><p><span>During the post-mortem I was deeply impressed by the fluency and depth of his analysis, and the sense of balance in his assessment of positions. To be honest, it left me feeling a little deflated. </span><strong>It was abundantly clear to me that he was a different class of player. I could perhaps compete with him in a single game, but not in the long haul.</strong><span> There aren’t many players I feel that way about, but Morozevich made the same impression, and to a lesser extent, Kasimdzhanov, Aronian and Sutovsky. </span><strong>There are some players who just seem to function a few orders of magnitude higher – as if they are qualitatively stronger, speaking a different language. </strong><span>(Jonathan Rowson, Chess for Zebras)</span></p></blockquote><div><p><span>Some people are just different. [8] Still: lean into what you’re good at, practice, and you can always get better!</span></p><p><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>Anyway, there are other lessons that I didn’t go into here, because I don’t want to spoil the entire book(s). Needless to say, they contain many excellent hacks for problem-solving. So if all of this piqued your interest, I’d highly recommend:</span></p><p><span>Think Like A Super-GM, Adams and Hurtado (</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Super-GM-Michael-Adams/dp/1784831670" rel="">Amazon</a><span>)</span><br><span>Problem Solving Through Problems, Larson (</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Solving-Through-Problems-Problem-Mathematics/dp/0387961712" rel="">Amazon</a><span>)</span><br><span>Think Like A Grandmaster, Kotov (</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Grandmaster-Alexander-Kotov/dp/0713478853" rel="">Amazon</a><span>)</span><br><span>How To Solve It, Polya (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It" rel="">Wikipedia</a><span>)</span><br><span>Chess for Zebras, Jonathan Rowson (</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chess-Zebras-Thinking-Jonathan-Rowson/dp/191146583X" rel="">Amazon</a><span>)</span></p><p><em><span>Thanks to </span><a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/" rel="">Tyler Cowen</a><span> for feedback on a draft.&nbsp;</span><br></em><span> </span><br><strong>Footnotes</strong></p><p><span>[1] In online chess games, a nice hack to make this easier for yourself is to flip the board to the opponent’s perspective when you’re trying to decide if a move works or not.

Maybe you gave up two weeks too early, and if you’d simply persisted you’d have struck gold. Didn’t the Airbnb guys persist for a whole year with no traction or signals of success before taking off?

A 4 is just 2*2 (and 2+2) so the solution won’t involve any 4s, and anything larger than 4 is going to be too big. </span></p><p><span>It’s easy – but wrong – to guess from this that the maximizing answer is probably either 3^333 + 1, or 2^500. You can then go down a rabbit hole to figure out which one is bigger, or use a calculator and find that it’s 3^333+1. </span><em>Complacency</em><span> would stop here and conclude that that’s probably the answer.</span></p><p><span>But it’s not! It’s helpful to work out some smaller examples first, such as 10:</span></p></div><ul><li><p>5+4+1 = 10, and 5*4*1 = 20</p></li><li><p>4+3+2+1 = 10, and the product is 24</p></li><li><p>3+3+2+2 = 10, and the product is 36</p></li></ul><div><p><span> Clearly,&nbsp;</span><em>the right answer never contains a 1</em><span>. So revisiting the 3^333 + 1 answer, the ‘next’ solution would be 3^332 + 2^2, which is indeed the correct answer.</span></p><p><span>[5] When doing a puzzle, you’re typically told to examine </span><em>checks, captures and threats</em><span> first -- in that order.</span></p><p><span>The Russian chess player Alexander Kotov wrote a famous book, Think Like a Grandmaster, which he outlines a more general thought process for every move and introduces the concept of </span><strong>the candidate move</strong><span> -- essentially, a plausible move in the position. His point is that you should list out all candidate moves first, before going into analysis of each one. Amateurs tend to find an interesting-looking move, and then dive in and analyze it, but it’s best to list all the plausible moves first so that you have an organized list of all the possibilities. </span></p><p><span>Larson has a similar set of techniques for math problems too. Unlike chess, it’s hard to have a consistent thought process for all math problems because they’re so different, so these lists tend to look more like a bunch of useful hacks: search for a pattern, draw a figure, modify the problem, choose good notation, consider extreme cases, and so on.</span></p><p><span>[6] Hence the GTD recommendation to write everything down: “your mind is for having ideas, not holding them”. </span></p><p><span>[7] </span><a href="https://gwern.net/dnb-faq#n-back-in-general" rel="">Gwern’s review of dual n-back</a><span> is interesting here, but as far as I can tell the conclusion is that it’s unclear whether this has any real benefit to working memory.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>[8] When you watch interviews with grandmasters about Magnus Carlsen, they usually identify a few traits of his that make him exceptional. </span></p><p><span>One of these is his insane chess memory (see </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC1BAcOzHyY&amp;t=105s" rel="">this YouTube video</a><span> for a vivid demonstration of this). Clearly, it’s the result of many hours and days of hard work. But there’s also some innate thing going on here. </span></p><p><span>Another is his chess intuition, which is chess player speak for “a disturbing knack for getting the right answer without any apparent effort, at sub-second speed”. There’s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1SCXb2WA2U" rel="">a great video showing this at work here</a><span> -- most players end up memorizing these endgames, but Magnus doesn’t, he works them out on the spot. At one point, he makes a very weird-looking move, the interviewer asks him why he made it, and Magnus says “That wins because, well honestly I don't know.” Similarly, at around 15:00, the interviewer asks if Magnus found the solution using the ‘key squares’ concept -- which most GMs would study explicitly -- and Magnus says in effect: no, it’s obvious to him on sight.</span></p><p><span>Another is that he’s insanely competitive, wants to win, and doesn’t get tired or let up even in extremely boring positions. </span></p><p><span>I’m sure he cultivates all of these things. But I’m also pretty sure they’re innate.</span></p></div></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/news/aktuelle-nyheter-2023/temporary-ban-of-behavioural-advertising-on-facebook-and-instagram/">https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/news/aktuelle-nyheter-2023/temporary-ban-of-behavioural-advertising-on-facebook-and-instagram/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36756101">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Meta tracks in detail the activity of users of its Facebook and Instagram platforms. Users are profiled based on where they are, what type of content they show interest in and what they publish, amongst others. These personal profiles are used for marketing purposes – so called behavioural advertising. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority considers that the practice of Meta is illegal and is therefore imposing a temporary ban of behavioural advertising on Facebook and Instagram.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ban</h2>
<p>In&nbsp;December last year, the Irish Data Protection Commission issued a decision on behalf of all data protection authorities across the EEA which established that Meta has conducted illegal behavioural advertising. Since then, Meta has made certain changes, but <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2023-07/cp230113en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fresh decision from the Court of Justice of the European Union (curia.europa.eu)</a> has stated that Meta’s behavioural advertising still does not comply with the law. Therefore, the Norwegian Data Protection Authority is now taking action by imposing a temporary ban.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;ban will apply from 4 August and last for three months, or until Meta can show that it complies with the law. Should Meta not comply with the decision, the company risks a coercive fine of up to one million NOK per day. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority’s decision only applies to users in Norway.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The platforms can still operate in Norway</h2>
<p>Many people in Norway use and enjoy social media – <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/publication/documents/2023-04/Ipsos%20SoMe-tracker%20Q1%202023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">figures from Ipsos (ipsos.com)</a> show that 82% of the adult Norwegian population have Facebook accounts and 65% have Instagram accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The Norwegian Data Protection Authority’s decision does not ban Facebook or Instagram in Norway. The purpose is rather to ensure that people in Norway can use these services in a secure way and that their rights are safeguarded, says Head of International in the Norwegian Data Protection Authority, Tobias Judin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Norwegian Data Protection Authority does not ban personalised advertising on Facebook or Instagram as such. The decision does not for example stop Meta from targeting advertising based on information a user put in their bio, such as place of residence, gender and age, or based on interests a user has provided themselves. Nor does the decision stop Meta from showing behavioural advertising to users who have given valid consent to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- All business models must respect privacy as a human right. Users must have sufficient control over their own data, and any tracking must be limited, Judin says.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Behavioural advertising one of the largest risks to privacy</h2>
<p>Meta, the company behind Facebook and Instagram, holds vast amounts of data on Norwegians, including sensitive data. Many Norwegians spend a lot of time on these platforms, and therefore tracking and profiling can be used to paint a detailed picture of these people’s private life, personality and interests. Many people interact with content such as that related to health, politics and sexual orientation, and there is also a danger that this is indirectly used to target marketing to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Invasive commercial surveillance for marketing purposes is one of the biggest risks to data protection on the internet today, Judin says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Meta decides what adverts someone is shown, they also decide what not to show someone. This affects freedom of expression and freedom of information in society. There is a risk that behavioural advertising strengthens existing stereotypes or could lead to unfair discrimination of various groups. Behavioural targeting of political adverts in election campaigns is particularly problematic from a democratic perspective.</p>
<p>As tracking is hidden from view, most people find it difficult to understand. There are also are many vulnerable people who use Facebook and Instagram that need extra protection such as children, the elderly and people with cognitive disabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>European co-operation and the way forward</h2>
<p>As Meta has its European headquarters in Dublin, it is normally the Irish Data Protection Commission that supervises the company in the EEA. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority can nevertheless intervene directly against Meta when there is an urgent need to act, and in such cases we can issue a decision which is valid for a period of three months. We consider that the criteria for acting urgently in this case are fulfilled, in particular because Meta has recently received both a decision and a judgment against them to which they have not aligned themselves with. If we don’t intervene now, the data protection rights of the majority of Norwegians would be violated indefinitely.</p>
<p>Moving forward, we may take the matter to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), of which we are a member, after the summer. The EDPB will decide whether the decision may be extended beyond its initial three month validity period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meta has expressed its views in relation to the case, and the company disagrees with our assessments. Meta can decide to challenge the Norwegian Data Protection Authority’s decision in the Oslo District Court.</p>

If they sent you a certificate you don't know if that's an attackers certificate or the owner's certificate.</p><p>The CA system is a (very imperfect) method of verifying ownership by having a trusted third party do the ownership verification. This way the certificate the owner gives you is effectively "notarized" so to speak.</p><p>tl;dr - DNS has no built-in signing or encryption, and is "MiTM'd" by design. It's common practice for your DNS server to be set to your company's DNS server, your ISP, etc. And those can send any response they want, and you have no way to authenticate if it's been modified or not.

The other two, Theresa Emory and John Maddox, did not respond to requests for comment. Lawyers who have represented the three researchers in similar litigation in the past declined to comment.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-3">J&amp;J is facing more than 38,000 lawsuits alleging that the company's talc products, including its Baby Powder, were contaminated by asbestos and caused cancers including ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. J&amp;J is attempting to resolve those lawsuits, as well as any future talc lawsuits, through an $8.9 billion <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/jj-unit-goes-bankrupt-second-time-pursue-89-bln-talc-settlement-2023-04-04/">settlement</a> in bankruptcy court.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">J&amp;J says that its talc products are safe and do not contain asbestos.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">J&amp;J has <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-stop-selling-talc-based-baby-powder-globally-2023-2022-08-11/">stopped</a> selling talc-based Baby Powder in favor of cornstarch-based products, citing an increase in lawsuits and "misinformation" about the talc product's safety.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">The company in 2021 began <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/inside-jjs-secret-plan-cap-litigation-payouts-cancer-victims-2022-02-04/">exploring</a> bankruptcy as a potential solution to the lawsuits, which saw a mixed record at trial, including several defense wins but also a <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-supreme-court-declines-hear-jj-appeal-over-2-billion-baby-powder-judgment-2021-06-01/">$2.1 billion</a> verdict awarded to 22 women who blamed their ovarian cancer on asbestos in the company's talc products. J&amp;J said in bankruptcy court filings in April that the costs of its talc-related verdicts, settlements and legal fees have reached about $4.5 billion.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">Last week's lawsuit against Emory and Maddox, pathologists affiliated with Peninsula Pathology Associates in Newport News, Virginia, and Kradin, a pulmonologist who worked at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center before his retirement, comes on the heels of another complaint LTL <a data-testid="Link" href="https://tmsnrt.rs/3OekVPq" target="_blank">filed</a> in late May against another doctor, Jacqueline Moline, who works at Northwell Health in Great Neck, New York, on similar grounds.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">Moline published an article in 2019 studying 33 patients who said their only exposure to asbestos came from talc products, and Emory, Kradin and Maddox followed up with a 2020 study of 75 similar patients.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">All four doctors have provided expert testimony in lawsuits against J&amp;J, and their research has been cited in lawsuits where they have not testified, according to the complaints.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">LTL said the researchers concealed the fact that some or all of the patients involved in their studies had been exposed to asbestos from other sources.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">The company is also asking the court to force the researchers to disclose the patients' identities.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">The lawsuits allege product disparagement and fraud, among other claims.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">Adam Zimmerman, a professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law, said companies rarely file lawsuits over research they disagree with. It will be very difficult for LTL to prove that the researchers intentionally harmed J&amp;J's reputation, which is required for product disparagement cases in New Jersey, but the company may view the lawsuits as a way to discourage other researchers or reclaim the narrative about talc safety, Zimmerman said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">"When a litigant starts suing opposing experts, that's very aggressive," Zimmerman said. "It sends a message that the gloves are off."</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">Moline has argued in court papers that LTL's litigation would have a profoundly chilling effect on future medical research if the company were allowed to unmask patients "in the hopes of publicly smearing them." Her court filings say that LTL's lawsuit was meant to "attack and silence" scientists, and that she has an ethical obligation to protect the identities of her research subjects.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">LTL's lawsuits allege that the doctors' research allowed them to collect millions of dollars from plaintiffs' lawyers to push a "false narrative" about J&amp;J. The complaint against Moline, for example, said she had made a "small fortune" testifying as a paid expert in lawsuits, receiving over $3 million from her work on asbestos lawsuits. LTL alleged that Kradin also made more than $3 million testifying as a plaintiffs' expert.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-17">The researchers could not immediately be reached for comment.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-18">LTL had filed similar lawsuits against the researchers in December 2022, but those complaints were linked to LTL’s first bankruptcy filing and were dismissed along with the rest of the bankruptcy in April.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-19">The cases are LTL Management v.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In the latest release of <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>,
you can add event listeners to elements with <code>hx-on</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code></code></pre>
<p>For all the other <code>hx-</code> attributes, we use CSS attribute selectors.
However, with <code>hx-on</code>, the attribute name is not fixed as it contains the event.
CSS attribute selectors support wildcards on the <em>value</em> of attributes,
but not the name:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[hx-trigger] <span>/* common and normal */</span>
[href^=<span>"https://dz4k.com"</span>] <span>/* "starts with" operator */</span>
[^<span>ĥx-on</span><span>:</span>] <span>/* not a thing */</span>
</code></pre>
<h2><ruby>X<rt>XML</rt>Path<rt>Path Language</rt></ruby></h2>
<p>XPath is a query language for extracting information from XML(-like) documents.
Its main use cases are XSLT and parsing API responses.</p>
<p>The XPath language is significantly more expressive than CSS,
making it possible to traverse the XML tree in any direction,
filter nodes based on arbitrary predicates,
and select any kind of node
(including comments, text nodes, and individual attributes).
Our non-existent CSS attribute could be written as follows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>//@*[starts-with(name(), "hx-on:")]
</code></pre>
<p>This post is not supposed to be an XPath tutorial, but I’ll break this one down:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>//</code></dt>
<dd>traverse the document (in CSS, this is the default)</dd>
<dt><code>@*</code></dt>
<dd>find any attribute (mnemonic: <strong>at</strong>-tribute)</dd>
<dt><code>[ ... ]</code></dt>
<dd>where…</dd>
<dt><code>starts-with(name(), "hx-on:")</code></dt>
<dd>its name starts with <code>"hx-on:"</code></dd>
</dl>
<p>CSS selectors don’t have these kinds of features,
and it has good reasons not to.
CSS has strict performance requirements
– to the point that “CSS optimization” is generally not a thing –
and selectors that offer more control could make slow selectors possible.
In addition, CSS has well-defined specificity rules, whereas XPath does not.</p>
<p>However, while these features make CSS great for stylesheets,
CSS selectors are also the most common way to find DOM elements in
JavaScript code and lacking in that regard.
Many libraries which extend HTML do so by traversing the entire document
and finding elements manually.
This is often not needed since, if you didn’t know,
<strong>XPath is built into browsers.</strong></p>
<h2>document.evaluate</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/XPath/Introduction_to_using_XPath_in_JavaScript"><code>document.evaluate</code> API</a> is somewhat archaic,
partly because it was designed for talking to XML APIs over <code>XMLHTTPRequest</code>.
Here’s a DOM-friendly wrapper:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>function* xpath(...args) {
  let path, root = document;
  if (args.length &gt; 1) [root, path] = args;
  else [path] = args;

  const nodeIterator = document.evaluate(
    path,
    root,
    null,
    XPathResult.UNORDERED_NODE_ITERATOR_TYPE,
    null,
  );

  for (
    let node = nodeIterator.iterateNext();
    node != null;
    node = nodeIterator.iterateNext()
  ) {
    yield node;
  }
}

// TypeScript declaration
function xpath(path: string): Iterable;
function xpath(root: Element, path: string): Iterable;
</code></pre>

Red’s ambitious goal is to build the world’s first <b>full-stack language</b>, a language you can use from system programming tasks, up to high-level scripting through DSL. You've probably heard of the term "<a href="http://www.laurencegellert.com/2012/08/what-is-a-full-stack-developer/" target="_blank">Full-Stack Developer</a>". But what is a full-stack Language, exactly?</p><p>

Other languages talk about having "one tool to rule them all". Red has that mindset too, pushed to the limit - it's a single executable that takes in your source files on any platform, and produces a packaged binary for any platform, from any other. The tool doesn’t depend on anything besides what came with your OS...shipping as a single executable that about a megabyte.</p><p>

But that technical feat alone isn't enough to define Red's notion of a "Full-Stack Language". It's about the ability to bend and redefine the system to meet any need, while still working with literate code, and getting top-flight performance. &nbsp;So what's being put in your hands is more like a "language construction set" than simply "a language". Whether you’re writing a device driver, a platform-native GUI application, or a shared library... Red lets you use a common syntax to code at the right level of abstraction for the task.</p><p><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xhOP35Dm99w/UuXFKgY2dlI/AAAAAAAAAGA/YQu98_pPDjw/s1600/reichart-abstraction-diagram.png">

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://duskos.org/">https://duskos.org/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36751422">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>Dusk OS is a 32-bit Forth and big brother to <a href="http://collapseos.org/">Collapse OS</a>. Its
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/fs/doc/design/purpose.txt">primary purpose</a> is to be maximally useful during the <a href="http://collapseos.org/why.html">first stage of
civilizational collapse</a>, that is, when we can't produce modern
computers anymore but that there's still many modern computers still around.</p>
<p>It does so by aggressively prioritizing <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/fs/doc/design/simple.txt">simplicity</a> at the cost of
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/fs/doc/design/limits.txt">unorthodox constraints</a>, while also aiming to make
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/fs/doc/design/shell.txt">operators happy</a>.</p>
<p>Dusk OS innovates by having an <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/fs/doc/cc/index.txt">"almost C" compiler</a> allowing it to
piggy-back on UNIX C code, through a modest <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/fs/doc/design/port.txt">porting effort</a>, to reach
its goals and stay true to its design constraints with a minimal effort.</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/800710912">Video showcasing Dusk OS</a></p>
<h2>Why build this OS?</h2>
<p>Most modern operating systems can do whatever we want them to do. Why do we
need another one? Simplicity.</p>
<p>It's difficult to predict post-collapse conditions, but we can suppose that
many <a href="#operator">operators</a> will need to use their machines in novel and
creative ways. Hackability of the operating system then becomes paramount. Open
source modern operating systems all can be modified to fit its user's needs,
but their complexity limits the likelihood that the user is able to do so. A
simpler OS increases this likelihood.</p>
<p>But we can't have our cake and eat it too, right? Either you have a simple toy
OS or a complex one. Well, maybe not?</p>
<p>Its authors believe that in the history of computing, Forth has been
under-explored. Its approach to simplicity is, we think, revolutionary. It
has significant shortcomings when system specifications become more complex
(Forth hates complexity and doesn't manage it well), but we believe it
possible to elegantly marry it with languages that like complexity better.</p>
<p>This mix, we believe, could provide the operator with computing powers rarely
seen with other approaches. We've got to try it.</p>
<p>To be clear: this is a research project, we don't know what it will yield
beforehand. We have the intuition that it might lead to a big "ah ah!" moment
and reveal a breathtaking combination of power and simplicity.</p>
<h2>Features making Dusk OS special</h2>
<h3>A whole OS built from source on boot</h3>
<p>One thing that makes Dusk OS special is that it boots from a very tiny core
(1000 lines of i386 assembly). From this tiny core, on boot, it builds its way
up to a system that has a functional C compiler, which then allows it to
bootstrap itself some more.</p>
<p>With regards to "source bootstrapping", it's even more extreme than Collapse OS
because modern machines allows this process to run quickly and the whole
process is still faster than a regular Linux boot. On Collapse OS target
machines, this process would be prohibitive, so a bigger part of the OS is
cross-compiled into the kernel.</p>
<p>This peculiarity of Dusk OS has interesting properties. The nicest one, in my
humble opinion, is that this allows us to sidestep the <em>entire</em> problems of
binary compatibility and relocation and only deal with source compatibility.
So, no ELF, no binutils, only code that is designed to run from where it was
generated in the first place. This is so much simpler!</p>
<p>Object files? Global symbols? Nah. C functions that don't have a static storage
type are simple Forth words.</p>
<h3>Harmonized Assembly Layer</h3>
<p>Dusk features what we call the <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/fs/doc/hal.txt">Harmonized Assembly Layer</a> (HAL for short).
This is a cross-CPU assembler, on which the C compiler relies, which prioritizes
implementation and usage simplicity, but is also designed to generate efficient
native code.</p>
<h3>Shortest path to self-hosting for an "almost C" compiler</h3>
<p>Dusk OS self-hosts in about 1000 lines of assembly and a few hundred lines of
Forth (the exact number depends on the target machine). From there, it
bootstraps to DuskCC, which is roughly 1500 lines of Forth code. To my
knowledge, Dusk OS is unique in that regard.</p>
<p>You can pick any C compiler that requires POSIX and it will automatically
require order of magnitudes more lines of code to bootstrap because you need
that POSIX system in addition to the C compiler. So even if you pick a small C
compiler such as tcc, you still need a POSIX system to build it, which is
usually in the millions of LOCs. </p>
<p>To be fair, Dusk OS is not the first project thinking of optimizing that path.
<a href="https://github.com/fosslinux/live-bootstrap">Efforts at making our modern software world bootstrappable</a>
lead to an "almost C", <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~oriansj/M2-Planet">M2-Planet</a> with a feature set comparable to
DuskCC with very few lines of code. M2-Planet itself is about 5K lines of code
and the various stages that lead to it are generally a few hundred lines each.
The project initially ran on top of regular kernels (as in "fat kernels with
lots of code"), but some bare metal stages (<a href="https://github.com/ironmeld/builder-hex0">1</a>,
<a href="https://git.stikonas.eu/andrius/stage0-uefi">2</a>) were created and now this little chain end up being
comparable to Dusk in terms of lines of code. Still more than Dusk, but in the
same ballpark.</p>
<p>Although this path is short and technically leads you to an "almost C"
compiler, you can hardly use it because it has no "real kernel" (those bare
metal stages mentioned above are enough to compile M2-Planet, but really not
much else, they're extremely limited) and no shell. You'll need those if you
want to use your shiny compiler.</p>
<p>One of your best picks, should you try this path, would be <a href="https://www.fiwix.org/">Fiwix</a>, a
minimal POSIX i386 kernel weighting less than 50K lines of C+asm. But then,
M2-Planet is not enough. You need to compile tcc (which M2-Planet can compile
after having applied a few patches) which weights 80K. Userspace is worse.
Bash+coreutils are 400K, even busybox is 190K. We still end up with a pretty
minimal and simple system, but it's still a lot more code than Dusk.</p>
<p>So, unless someone tells me about some option I don't know about, DuskCC is
quite innovative on the aspect of self-hosting path length.</p>

<h2>Who is Dusk for?</h2>
<p>Dusk OS doesn't have users, but <em>operators</em>. What's the difference? Control.
You <em>use</em> a phone, you <em>use</em> a coffee machine, hell you even <em>use</em> a car these
days. But you <em>operate</em> a bulldozer, you <em>operate</em> a crane, you <em>operate</em> a
plane.</p>
<p>You <em>use</em> Linux, you <em>use</em> Windows. You <em>operate</em> Dusk OS.</p>
<p>Can you <em>operate</em> Linux? Sure, if you're some kind of god<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, in the same way
that you can <em>operate</em> a Tesla if you're a top Tesla engineer. But you're much
more likely to be able to <em>operate</em> a landmower than a Tesla.</p>
<p>The Dusk operator is someone who's <a href="http://collapseos.org/why.html#creative">creative</a>, close to hardware, can
read a datasheet. Dusk shines when one wants to poke around the hardware
without limit.</p>
<p>It compares favorably to other more complete OSes because there's no concurrent
process to mess with your poking and the driver structure is more approachable,
hackable due to its stricter scope and savvier target audience.</p>
<p>Let's use an example. Let's say you're on a notebook that runs on a chipset of
Intel's ICHn family. You read the datasheet and see "oh, nice, there's an SPI
interface in there. Maybe that it's not hooked to anything on the notebook,
let's play with it."</p>
<p>Now, that chipset is very, very central to the computer. There are good chances,
on a BSD or Linux system, that if you begin poking around its registers, you'll
step on someone else toes and crash the system because, for example, of some
other process that needed to read from disk at the same time.</p>
<p>In Dusk, you could completely break the SATA controller, you'll still be golden
as long as you don't access mass storage. Because Dusk doesn't have
concurrency, you have tight control over what happen or doesn't happen on the
machine, so all you need to do is to avoid words that access mass storage. That
gives you ample wiggling space for your hacking session.</p>
<p>To be clear: this is also possible with a custom made BSD or Linux, but you're
going to have to strip a lot of pieces from your distro before you get there
and some of those pieces might be useful debugging tools which will be
difficult to retrofit because they need a wider system. You'll also need a
higher cognitive space to fit BSD/Linux wider abstractions in your mind.</p>
<h2>Status</h2>
<ul>
<li>Has a VM written in C, buildable from a POSIX environment, which allows Dusk
  to build itself for any of its supported targets.</li>
<li>Has an <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/fs/doc/cc/index.txt">"almost C" compiler</a> which still needs some work, but is
  already capable of compiling a nice subset of C.</li>
<li>Can run on i386 and ARM. <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~vdupras/duskos/tree/master/HARDWARE.md">Detailed list of supported hardware.</a></li>
<li>Can read, write and boot from FAT12/FAT16 (no FAT32 for now) volumes.</li>
<li>Can create new FAT12/FAT16 volumes.</li>
<li>Very small footprint. In Grid mode (TUI mode) with the Grid text editor
  and DuskCC (including its stdlib) loaded, Dusk uses 180KB of RAM on a PC.</li>
<li>It completely self-hosts on all its target machines. (Well, only PC at this
  point because the ARM port is still a WIP, but it <em>will</em> self-host)</li>
<li>Simple and terse. The core system (all kernels, drivers, filesystems, CC,
  core libraries) is less than 9K lines of code.</li>
<li>Since <code>text/ed</code> has reached a usable status, the main author of Dusk has been
  developing it from within itself on an old Pentium 75 Mhz with 16mb of RAM and
  he's having a blast.</li>
</ul>
<p>List of ported codebases:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html">uxn</a> VM</li>
<li>The <code>puff()</code> algorithm from <a href="https://github.com/madler/zlib">zlib</a></li>
<li>The <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/left">left</a> text editor. (Still a bit glitchy...)</li>
</ul>
<p>List of homegrown applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>C Compiler (see <code>doc/cc</code>)</li>
<li>Text editor (see <code>doc/text/ed</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Funding</h2>
<p>You are inspired by Dusk OS and would like to fund its development? I don't do
any kind of crowdfunding, but if you happen to be a rich philanthropist, <a href="https://duskos.org/funding.html">maybe

<p>What happens if you give the Intel 8086 processor an instruction that doesn't exist?
A modern microprocessor (80186 and later) will generate an exception, indicating that an illegal instruction
was executed.
However, early microprocessors didn't include the circuitry to detect illegal instructions, since the chips didn't have
transistors to spare. Instead these processors would do <em>something</em>,
but the results weren't specified.<span id="fnref:6502"><a href="#fn:6502">1</a></span></p>
<p>The 8086 has a number of undocumented instructions.
Most of them are simply duplicates of regular instructions, but a few have unexpected behavior, such as revealing the
values of internal, hidden registers.
In the 8086, most instructions are implemented in microcode, so examining the 8086's microcode can explain why these instructions
behave the way they do.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the 8086 die under a microscope, with the important functional blocks labeled. The metal layer is visible, while the underlying silicon and polysilicon wiring is mostly hidden.
The microcode ROM and the microcode address decoder are in the lower right.
The Group Decode ROM (upper center) is also important, as it performs the first step of instruction decoding.</p>

<h2>Microcode and 8086 instruction decoding</h2>
<p>You might think that machine instructions are the basic steps that a computer performs.
However, instructions usually require multiple steps inside the processor.
One way of expressing these multiple steps is through microcode, a technique dating back to 1951.
To execute a machine instruction, the computer internally executes several simpler micro-instructions, specified by the microcode.
In other words, microcode forms nother layer between the machine instructions and the hardware.
The main advantage of microcode is that it turns the processor's control logic into a programming task instead of a difficult logic design task.</p>
<p>The 8068's <a href="https://www.righto.com/2022/11/how-8086-processors-microcode-engine.html">microcode ROM</a> holds 512 micro-instructions, each 21 bits wide.
Each micro-instruction performs two actions in parallel. First is a move between a source and a destination, typically registers.
Second is an operation that can range from an arithmetic (ALU) operation to a memory access.
The diagram below shows the structure of a 21-bit micro-instruction, divided into six types.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-ad-undoc/microcode-format.jpg"><img alt="The encoding of a micro-instruction into 21 bits. Based on NEC v.

Based on NEC v. Intel: Will Hardware Be Drawn into the Black Hole of Copyright?" width="700"></a></p>
<p>When executing a machine instruction, the 8086 performs a decoding step.
Although the 8086 is a 16-bit processor, its instructions are based on bytes. In most cases, the first byte specifies the
opcode, which may be followed by additional instruction bytes.
In other cases, the byte is a "prefix" byte, which changes the behavior of the following instruction.
The first byte is analyzed
by something called the <a href="https://www.righto.com/2023/05/8086-processor-group-decode-rom.html">Group Decode ROM</a>.
This circuit categorizes the first byte of the instruction into about <code>35</code> categories that control how the instruction is
decoded and executed.
One category is "1-byte logic"; this indicates a one-byte instruction or prefix that is simple and implemented by logic circuitry in the 8086.
For instructions in this category, microcode is not involved while
the remaining instructions are implemented in microcode.
Many of these instructions are in the "two-byte ROM" category indicating that the instruction has a second byte
that also needs to be decoded by microcode.
This second byte, called the ModR/M byte, specifies that memory addressing mode or registers that the instruction uses.</p>
<p>The next step is the microcode's address decoder circuit, which determines where to start executing microcode based on
the opcode.
Conceptually, you can think of the microcode as stored in a ROM, indexed by the instruction opcode and a few sequence bits.
However, since many instructions can use the same microcode, it would be inefficient to store duplicate copies of these routines.
Instead, the microcode address decoder permits multiple instructions to reference the same entries in the ROM.
This decoding circuitry is similar to a PLA (Programmable Logic Array) so it matches bit patterns to determine a particular starting point.
This turns out to be important for undocumented instructions since undocumented instructions often match the pattern for a "real" instruction, making the undocumented instruction an alias.</p>
<p>The 8086 has several internal registers that are invisible to the programmer but are used by the microcode.
Memory accesses use the Indirect (<code>IND</code>) and Operand (<code>OPR</code>) registers; the <code>IND</code> register holds the address in the segment,
while the <code>OPR</code> register holds the data value that is read or written.
Although these registers are normally not accessible by the programmer, some undocumented instructions provide access to these registers, as will be described later.</p>
<p>The Arithmetic/Logic Unit (ALU) performs arithmetic, logical, and shift operations in the 8086.
The ALU uses three internal registers: <code>tmpA</code>, <code>tmpB</code>, and <code>tmpC</code>. An ALU operation requires two micro-instructions.
The first micro-instruction specifies the operation (such as <code>ADD</code>) and the temporary register that holds one argument (e.g. <code>tmpA</code>);
the second argument is always in <code>tmpB</code>.
A following micro-instruction can access the ALU result through the pseudo-register <code>Σ</code> (sigma).</p>
<h3>The ModR/M byte</h3>
<p>A fundamental part of the 8086 instruction format is the ModR/M byte, a byte that specifies addressing for many instructions.
The 8086 has a variety of addressing modes, so the ModR/M byte is somewhat complicated.
Normally it specifies one memory address and one register. The memory address is specified through one of eight addressing
modes (below) along with an optional 8- or 16-bit displacement in the instruction.
Instead of a memory address, the ModR/M byte can also specify a second register.
For a few opcodes, the ModR/M byte selects what instruction to execute rather than a register.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-ad-undoc/modrm.png"><img alt="The 8086's addressing modes. From The register assignments, from MCS-86 Assembly Language Reference Guide." height="220" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-ad-undoc/modrm-w250.png" title="The 8086's addressing modes. From The register assignments, from MCS-86 Assembly Language Reference Guide." width="250"></a></p>
<p>The implementation of the ModR/M byte plays an important role in the behavior of undocumented instructions.
Support for this byte is implemented in both microcode and hardware.
The various memory address modes above are implemented by microcode subroutines, which compute the appropriate memory address and
perform a read if necessary.
The subroutine leaves the memory address in the <code>IND</code> register, and if a read is performed, the value is in the <code>OPR</code> register.</p>
<p>The hardware hides the ModR/M byte's selection of memory versus register, by making the value available through the pseudo-register <code>M</code>, while the second register is available through <code>N</code>.
Thus, the microcode for an instruction doesn't need to know if the value was in memory or a register, or which register was selected.
The Group Decode ROM examines the first byte of the instruction to determine if a ModR/M byte is present, and if a read
is required.
If the ModR/M byte specifies memory, the Translation ROM determines which micro-subroutines to call before handling the
instruction itself.
For more on the ModR/M byte, see my post on <a href="https://www.righto.com/2023/02/8086-modrm-addressing.html">Reverse-engineering the ModR/M addressing microcode</a>.</p>
<h2>Holes in the opcode table</h2>
<p>The first byte of the instruction is a value from <code>00</code> to <code>FF</code> in hex.
Almost all of these opcode values correspond to documented 8086 instructions, but there are a few exceptions, "holes" in the opcode table.
The table below shows the 256 first-byte opcodes for the 8086, from hex <code>00</code> to <code>FF</code>. Valid opcodes for the 8086 are in white;
the colored opcodes are undefined and interesting to examine.
Orange, yellow, and green opcodes were given meaning in the 80186, 80286, and 80386 respectively.
The purple opcode is unusual: it was implemented in the 8086 and later processors but not documented.<span id="fnref:prefixes"><a href="#fn:prefixes">2</a></span>
In this section, I'll examine the microcode for these opcode holes.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-ad-undoc/opcodes.png"><img alt="This table shows the 256 opcodes for the 8086, where the white ones are valid instructions.

<h3><code>D6</code>: <code>SALC</code></h3>
<p>The opcode <code>D6</code> (purple above) performs a well-known but undocumented operation that is typically called <code>SALC</code>, for Set AL to Carry.
This instruction sets the <code>AL</code> register to 0 if the carry flag is 0, and sets the <code>AL</code> register to <code>FF</code> if the carry flag is 1.
The curious thing about this undocumented instruction is that it exists in all x86 CPUs, but Intel didn't mention it until 2017.
Intel probably put this instruction into the processor deliberately as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_entry#Copyright_traps">copyright trap</a>.
The idea is that if a company created a copy of the 8086 processor and the processor included the <code>SALC</code> instruction, this
would prove that the company had copied Intel's microcode and thus had potentially violated Intel's copyright on the microcode.
This came to light when NEC created improved versions of the 8086, the NEC V20 and V30 microprocessors, and was sued by Intel.
Intel analyzed NEC's microcode but was disappointed to find that NEC's chip did not include the hidden instruction, showing
that NEC hadn't copied the microcode.<span id="fnref:magic-instruction"><a href="#fn:magic-instruction">3</a></span>
Although a Federal judge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/08/business/intel-loses-copyright-case-to-nec.html">ruled</a> in 1989 that NEC hadn't infringed
Intel's copyright, the 5-year trial ruined NEC's market momentum.</p>
<p>The <code>SALC</code> instruction is implemented with three micro-instructions, shown below.<span id="fnref:microcode"><a href="#fn:microcode">4</a></span>
The first micro-instruction jumps if the carry (<code>CY</code>) is set.
If not, the next instruction moves 0 to the AL register. <code>RNI</code> (Run Next Instruction) ends the microcode execution
causing the next machine instruction to run.
If the carry was set, all-ones (i.e. <code>FF</code> hex) is moved to the <code>AL</code> register and RNI ends the microcode sequence.</p>
<pre>           JMPS CY 2 <span><b>SALC</b>: jump on carry</span>
ZERO → AL  RNI       <span>Move 0 to AL, run next instruction</span>
ONES → AL  RNI       <span><b>2:</b>Move FF to AL, run next instruction</span>
</pre>

<h3><code>0F</code>: <code>POP CS</code></h3>
<p>The <code>0F</code> opcode is the first hole in the opcode table.
The 8086 has instructions to push and pop the four segment registers, except opcode <code>0F</code> is undefined where <code>POP CS</code> should be.
This opcode performs <code>POP CS</code> successfully, so the question is why is it undefined?
The reason is that <code>POP CS</code> is essentially useless and doesn't do what you'd expect, so Intel figured it was best not
to document it.</p>
<p>To understand why <code>POP CS</code> is useless, I need to step back and explain the 8086's segment registers.
The 8086 has a <code>20</code>-bit address space, but 16-bit registers.
To make this work, the 8086 has the concept of segments: memory is accessed in 64K chunks called segments, which are positioned
in the 1-megabyte address space.
Specifically, there are four segments: Code Segment, Stack Segment, Data Segment, and Extra Segment,
with four segment registers that define the start of the segment: <code>CS</code>, <code>SS</code>, <code>DS</code>, and <code>ES</code>.</p>
<p>An inconvenient part of segment addressing  is that if you want to access more than 64K, you need to change the segment register.
So you might push the data segment register, change it temporarily so you can access a new part of memory, and then pop the old data segment
register value off the stack.
This would use the <code>PUSH DS</code> and <code>POP DS</code> instructions.
But why not <code>POP CS</code>?</p>
<p>The 8086 executes code from the code segment, with the instruction pointer (<code>IP</code>) tracking the location in the code segment.
The main problem with <code>POP CS</code> is that it changes the code segment, but not the instruction pointer, so now you are executing
code at the old offset in a new segment.
Unless you line up your code extremely carefully, the result is that you're jumping to an unexpected place in memory.
(Normally, you want to change <code>CS</code> and the instruction pointer at the same time, using a <code>CALL</code> or <code>JMP</code> instruction.)</p>
<p>The second problem with <code>POP CS</code> is prefetching.
For efficiency, the 8086 prefetches instructions before they are needed, storing them in an 8-byte prefetch queue.
When you perform a jump, for instance, the microcode flushes the prefetch queue so execution will continue with the
new instructions, rather than the old instructions.
However, the instructions that pop a segment register don't flush the prefetch buffer.
Thus, <code>POP CS</code> not only jumps to an unexpected location in memory, but it will execute an unpredictable number of instructions
from the old code path.</p>
<p>The <code>POP segment register</code> microcode below packs a lot into three micro-instructions.
The first micro-instruction pops a value from the stack.
Specifically, it moves the stack pointer (<code>SP</code>) to the Indirect (<code>IND</code>) register.
The Indirect register is an internal register, invisible to the programmer, that holds the address offset for memory
accesses.
The first micro-instruction also performs a memory read (<code>R</code>) from the stack segment (<code>SS</code>) and then increments <code>IND</code>
by 2 (<code>P2</code>, plus 2).
The second micro-instruction moves <code>IND</code> to the stack pointer, updating the stack pointer with the new value.
It also tells the microcode engine that this micro-instruction is the next-to-last (<code>NXT</code>) and the next machine instruction
can be started.
The final micro-instruction moves the value read from memory to the appropriate segment register and runs the next instruction.
Specifically, reads and writes put data in the internal <code>OPR</code> (Operand) register.
The hardware uses the register <code>N</code> to indicate the register specified by the instruction.
That is, the value will be stored in the <code>CS</code>, <code>DS</code>, <code>ES</code>, or <code>SS</code> register, depending on the bit pattern in the instruction.
Thus, the same microcode works for all four segment registers.
This is why <code>POP CS</code> works even though <code>POP CS</code> wasn't explicitly implemented in the microcode; it uses the common code.</p>
<pre>SP → IND  R SS,P2 <span><b>POP sr</b>: read from stack, compute IND plus 2</span>
IND → SP  NXT     <span>Put updated value in SP, start next instruction.</span>
OPR → N   RNI     <span>Put stack value in specified segment register</span>
</pre>

<p>But why does <code>POP CS</code> run this microcode in the first place?
The microcode to execute is selected based on the instruction, but multiple instructions can execute the same microcode.
You can think of the address decoder as pattern-matching on the instruction's bit patterns, where some of the bits can be ignored.
In this case, the <code>POP sr</code> microcode above is run by any instruction with the bit pattern 000??111, where a question mark
can be either a 0 or a 1.
You can verify that this pattern matches <code>POP ES</code> (<code>07</code>), <code>POP SS</code> (<code>17</code>), and <code>POP DS</code> (<code>1F</code>).
However, it also matches <code>0F</code>, which is why the <code>0F</code> opcode runs the above microcode and performs <code>POP CS</code>.
In other words, to make <code>0F</code> do something other than <code>POP CS</code> would require additional circuitry, so it was easier to
leave the action implemented but undocumented.</p>
<h3><code>60</code>-<code>6F</code>: conditional jumps</h3>
<p>One whole row of the opcode table is unused: values <code>60</code> to <code>6F</code>.
These opcodes simply act the same as <code>70</code> to <code>7F</code>, the conditional jump instructions.</p>
<p>The conditional jumps use the following microcode.
It fetches the jump offset from the instruction prefetch queue (<code>Q</code>) and puts the value into the ALU's <code>tmpBL</code> register,
the low byte of the <code>tmpB</code> register.
It tests the condition in the instruction (<code>XC</code>) and jumps to the <code>RELJMP</code> micro-subroutine if satisfied.
The <code>RELJMP</code> code (not shown) updates the program counter to perform the jump.</p>
<pre>Q → tmpBL                <span><b>Jcond cb:</b> Get offset from prefetch queue</span>
           JMP XC RELJMP <span>Test condition, if true jump to RELJMP routine</span>
           RNI           <span>No jump: run next instruction</span>
</pre>

<p>This code is executed for any instruction matching the bit pattern <code>011?????</code>, i.e. anything from <code>60</code> to <code>7F</code>.
The condition is specified by the four low bits of the instruction.
The result is that any instruction <code>60</code>-<code>6F</code> is an alias for the corresponding conditional jump <code>70</code>-<code>7F</code>.</p>
<h3><code>C0</code>, <code>C8</code>: <code>RET/RETF imm</code></h3>
<p>These undocumented opcodes act like a return instruction, specifically <code>RET imm16</code> (<a href="https://www.os2museum.com/wp/undocumented-8086-opcodes-part-i/">source</a>).
Specifically, the instruction <code>C0</code> is the same as <code>C2</code>, near return, while <code>C8</code> is the same as <code>CA</code>, far return.</p>
<p>The microcode below is executed for the instruction bits <code>1100?0?0</code>, so it is executed for <code>C0</code>, <code>C2</code>, <code>C8</code>, and <code>CA</code>.
It gets two bytes from the instruction prefetch queue (<code>Q</code>) and puts them in the <code>AX</code> register.
Next, it calls <code>FARRET</code>, which performs either a near return (popping <code>PC</code> from the stack) or a far return (popping <code>PC</code> and <code>CS</code>
from the stack). Finally, it adds the original argument to the <code>SP</code>, equivalent to popping that many bytes.</p>
<pre>Q → tmpAL    ADD tmpA    <span><b>RET/RETF iw:</b> Get word from prefetch, set up ADD</span>
Q → tmpAH    CALL FARRET <span>Call Far Return micro-subroutine</span>
IND → tmpB               <span>Move SP (in IND) to tmpB for ADD</span>
Σ → SP       RNI         <span>Put sum in Stack Pointer, end</span>
</pre>

<p>One tricky part is that the <code>FARRET</code> micro-subroutine examines bit 3 of the instruction to determine whether it does a near
return or a far return.
This is why documented instruction <code>C2</code> is a near return and <code>CA</code> is a far return.
Since <code>C0</code> and <code>C8</code> run the same microcode, they will perform the same actions, a near return and a far return respectively.</p>
<h3><code>C1</code>: <code>RET</code></h3>
<p>The undocumented <code>C1</code> opcode is identical to the documented <code>C3</code>, near return instruction.
The microcode below is executed for instruction bits <code>110000?1</code>, i.e. <code>C1</code> and <code>C3</code>.
The first micro-instruction reads from the Stack Pointer, incrementing <code>IND</code> by 2.
Prefetching is suspended and the prefetch queue is flushed, since execution will continue at a new location.
The Program Counter is updated with the value from the stack, read into the <code>OPR</code> register.
Finally, the updated address is put in the Stack Pointer and execution ends.</p>
<pre>SP → IND  R SS,P2  <span><b>RET: </b> Read from stack, increment by 2</span>
          SUSP     <span>Suspend prefetching</span>
OPR → PC  FLUSH    <span>Update PC from stack, flush prefetch queue</span>
IND → SP  RNI      <span>Update SP, run next instruction</span>
</pre>

<h3><code>C9</code>: <code>RET</code></h3>
<p>The undocumented <code>C9</code> opcode is identical to the documented <code>CB</code>, far return instruction.
This microcode is executed for instruction bits <code>110010?1</code>, i.e. <code>C9</code> and <code>CB</code>, so <code>C9</code> is identical to <code>CB</code>.
The microcode below simply calls the <code>FARRET</code> micro-subroutine to pop the Program Counter and CS register.
Then the new value is stored into the Stack Pointer.
One subtlety is that <code>FARRET</code> looks at bit 3 of the instruction to switch between a near return and a far return, as
described earlier.
Since <code>C9</code> and <code>CB</code> both have bit 3 set, they both perform a far return.</p>
<pre>          CALL FARRET  <span><b>RETF:</b> call FARRET routine</span>
IND → SP  RNI          <span>Update stack pointer, run next instruction</span>
</pre>

<h3><code>F1</code>: <code>LOCK</code> prefix</h3>
<p>The final hole in the opcode table is <code>F1</code>.
This opcode is different because it is implemented in logic rather than microcode.
The Group Decode ROM indicates that <code>F1</code> is a prefix, one-byte logic, and LOCK.
The Group Decode outputs are the same as <code>F0</code>, so <code>F1</code> also acts as a <code>LOCK</code> prefix.</p>
<h2>Holes in two-byte opcodes</h2>
<p>For most of the 8086 instructions, the first byte specifies the instruction.
However, the 8086 has a few instructions where the second byte specifies the instruction: the <code>reg</code> field of the ModR/M byte provides an opcode extension that selects the instruction.<span id="fnref:extension"><a href="#fn:extension">5</a></span>
These fall into four categories which Intel labeled "Immed", "Shift", "Group 1", and "Group 2", corresponding to opcodes <code>80</code>-<code>83</code>, <code>D0</code>-<code>D3</code>,
<code>F6</code>-<code>F7</code>, and <code>FE</code>-<code>FF</code>.
The table below shows how the second byte selects the instruction.
Note that "Shift", "Group 1", and "Group 2" all have gaps, resulting in undocumented values.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-ad-undoc/groups.jpg"><img alt="Meaning of the reg field in two-byte opcodes. From MCS-86 Assembly Language Reference Guide." height="129" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-ad-undoc/groups-w600.jpg" title="Meaning of the reg field in two-byte opcodes. From MCS-86 Assembly Language Reference Guide." width="600"></a></p>
<p>These sets of instructions are implemented in two completely different ways.
The "Immed" and "Shift" instructions run microcode in the standard way, selected by the first byte.
For a typical arithmetic/logic instruction such as <code>ADD</code>, bits 5-3 of the first instruction byte are latched into the <code>X</code> register to indicate
which ALU operation to perform.
The microcode specifies a generic ALU operation, while the <code>X</code> register controls whether the operation is an <code>ADD</code>, <code>SUB</code>, <code>XOR</code>, or
so forth.
However, the Group Decode ROM indicates that for the special "Immed" and "Shift" instructions, the <code>X</code> register latches the bits
from the <em>second</em> byte.
Thus, when the microcode executes a generic ALU operation, it ends up with the one specified in the second byte.<span id="fnref:alu"><a href="#fn:alu">6</a></span></p>
<p>The "Group 1" and "Group 2" instructions (<code>F0</code>-<code>F1</code>, <code>FE</code>-<code>FF</code>), however, run different microcode for each instruction.
Bits 5-3 of the second byte replace bits 2-0 of the instruction before executing the microcode.
Thus, <code>F0</code> and <code>F1</code> act as if they are opcodes in the range <code>F0</code>-<code>F7</code>, while <code>FE</code> and <code>FF</code> act as if they are opcodes in the range <code>F8</code>-<code>FF</code>.
Thus, each instruction specified by the second byte can have its own microcode, unlike the "Immed" and "Shift" instructions.
The trick that makes this work is that all the "real" opcodes in the range <code>F0</code>-<code>FF</code> are implemented in logic, not microcode,
so there are no collisions.</p>
<h3>The hole in "Shift": <code>SETMO</code>, <code>D0</code>..<code>D3/6</code></h3>
<p>There is a "hole" in the list of shift operations when the second byte has the bits <code>110</code> (6).
(This is typically expressed as <code>D0/6</code> and so forth; the value after the slash is the opcode-selection bits in the ModR/M byte.)
Internally, this value selects the ALU's <code>SETMO</code> (Set Minus One) operation, which simply returns <code>FF</code> or <code>FFFF</code>, for a byte or word operation respectively.<span id="fnref:setmo"><a href="#fn:setmo">7</a></span></p>
<p>The microcode below is executed for 1101000? bit patterns patterns (D0 and D1).
The first instruction gets the value from the <code>M</code> register and sets up the ALU to do whatever operation was
specified in the instruction (indicated by <code>XI</code>).
Thus, the same microcode is used for all the "Shift" instructions, including <code>SETMO</code>.
The result is written back to <code>M</code>. If no writeback to memory is required (<code>NWB</code>), then <code>RNI</code> runs the next instruction, ending
the microcode sequence.
However, if the result is going to memory, then the last line writes the value to memory.</p>
<pre>M → tmpB  XI tmpB, NXT  <span><b>rot rm, 1</b>: get argument, set up ALU</span>
Σ → M     NWB,RNI F     <span>Store result, maybe run next instruction</span>
          W DS,P0 RNI   <span>Write result to memory</span>
</pre>

<p>The D2 and D3 instructions (1101001?) perform a variable number of shifts, specified by the <code>CL</code> register, so they use different microcode (below).
This microcode loops the number of times specified by <code>CL</code>, but the control flow is a bit tricky to avoid shifting if
the intial counter value is 0.
The code sets up the ALU to pass the counter (in <code>tmpA</code>) unmodified the first time (<code>PASS</code>) and jumps to <b>4</b>, which
updates the counter and sets up the ALU for the shift operation (<code>XI</code>).
If the counter is not zero, it jumps back to <b>3</b>, which performs the previously-specified shift and sets up
the ALU to decrement the counter (<code>DEC</code>).
This time, the code at <b>4</b> decrements the counter.
The loop continues until the counter reaches zero. The microcode stores the result as in the previous microcode.</p>

<h3>The hole in "group 1": <code>TEST</code>, <code>F6/1</code> and <code>F7/1</code></h3>
<p>The <code>F6</code> and <code>F7</code> opcodes are in "group 1", with the specific instruction specified by bits 5-3 of the second byte.
The second-byte table showed a hole for the <code>001</code> bit sequence.
As explained earlier, these bits replace the low-order bits of the instruction, so <code>F6</code> with 001 is processed as if it were
the opcode <code>F1</code>.
The microcode below matches against instruction bits <code>1111000?</code>, so <code>F6/1</code> and <code>F7/1</code> have the same effect as <code>F6/0</code> and <code>F7/1</code> respectively,
that is, the byte and word <code>TEST</code> instructions.</p>
<p>The microcode below gets one or two bytes from the prefetch queue (<code>Q</code>); the <code>L8</code> condition tests if the operation is
an 8-bit (i.e. byte) operation and skips the second micro-instruction.
The third micro-instruction ANDs the argument and the fetched value.
The condition flags (<code>F</code>) are set based on the result, but the result itself is discarded.
Thus, the <code>TEST</code> instruction tests a value against a mask, seeing if any bits are set.</p>
<pre>Q → tmpBL    JMPS L8 2     <span><b>TEST rm,i:</b> Get byte, jump if operation length = 8</span>
Q → tmpBH                  <span>Get second byte from the prefetch queue</span>
M → tmpA     AND tmpA, NXT <span><b>2:</b> Get argument, AND with fetched value</span>
Σ → no dest  RNI F         <span>Discard result but set flags.</span>

<p>I explained the processing of these "Group 3" instructions in more detail in my <a href="https://www.righto.com/2022/11/how-8086-processors-microcode-engine.html">microcode article</a>.</p>
<h3>The hole in "group 2": <code>PUSH</code>, <code>FE/7</code> and <code>FF/7</code></h3>
<p>The <code>FE</code> and <code>FF</code> opcodes are in "group 2", which has a hole for the <code>111</code> bit sequence in the second byte.
After replacement, this will be processed as the <code>FF</code> opcode, which matches the pattern <code>1111111?</code>.
In other words, the instruction will be processed the same as the <code>110</code> bit pattern, which is <code>PUSH</code>.
The microcode gets the Stack Pointer, sets up the ALU to decrement it by 2.
The new value is written to <code>SP</code> and <code>IND</code>. Finally, the register value is written to stack memory.</p>
<!--
For some reason, the [8086 undocumented instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#Undocumented_x86_instructions) page on Wikipedia doesn't list FE-FF.

<h3><code>82</code> and <code>83</code> "Immed" group</h3>
<p>Opcodes <code>80</code>-<code>83</code> are the "Immed" group, performing one of eight arithmetic operations, specified in the ModR/M byte.
The four opcodes differ in the size of the values: opcode <code>80</code> applies an 8-bit immediate value to an 8-bit register, <code>81</code> applies a 16-bit
value to a 16-bit register, <code>82</code> applies an 8-bit value to an 8-bit register, and <code>83</code> applies an 8-bit value to a 16-bit register.
The opcode 82 has the strange situation that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#Undocumented_instructions_that_are_widely_available_across_many_x86_CPUs_include">some sources</a> say it is undocumented, but it shows up in some Intel documentation as a valid bit combination (e.g. below).
Note that <code>80</code> and <code>82</code> have the  8-bit to 8-bit action, so the <code>82</code> opcode is redundant.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-ad-undoc/adc.png"><img alt="ADC is one of the instructions with opcode 80-83. From the 8086 datasheet, page 27." height="34" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8086-ad-undoc/adc-w600.png" title="ADC is one of the instructions with opcode 80-83. From the 8086 datasheet, page 27." width="600"></a></p><p>ADC is one of the instructions with opcode 80-83. From the <a href="https://www.electro-tech-online.com/datasheets/8086_intel.pdf">8086 datasheet</a>, page 27.</p>
<p>The microcode below is used for all four opcodes.
If the ModR/M byte specifies memory, the appropriate micro-subroutine is called to compute the effective address in <code>IND</code>,
and fetch the byte or word into <code>OPR</code>.
The first two instructions below get the two immediate data bytes from the prefetch queue; for an 8-bit operation, the second byte
is skipped.
Next, the second argument <code>M</code> is loaded into tmpA and the desired ALU operation (<code>XI</code>) is configured.
The result <code>Σ</code> is stored into the specified register <code>M</code> and the operation may terminate with <code>RNI</code>.
But if the ModR/M byte specified memory, the following write micro-operation saves the value to memory.</p>
<pre>Q → tmpBL  JMPS L8 2    <span><b>alu rm,i</b>: get byte, test if 8-bit op</span>
Q → tmpBH               <span>Maybe get second byte</span>
M → tmpA   XI tmpA, NXT <span><b>2</b>: </span>
Σ → M      NWB,RNI F    <span>Save result, update flags, done if no memory writeback</span>
           W DS,P0 RNI  <span>Write result to memory if needed</span>
</pre>

<p>The tricky part of this is the <code>L8</code> condition, which tests if the operation is 8-bit.
You might think that bit 0 acts as the byte/word bit in a nice, orthogonal way, but the 8086 has a bunch of special cases.
Bit 0 of the instruction typically selects between a byte and a word operation, but there are a bunch of special cases.
The Group Decode ROM creates a signal indicating if bit 0 should be used as the byte/word bit.
But it generates a second signal indicating that an instruction should be forced to operate on bytes, for instructions
such as <code>DAA</code> and <code>XLAT</code>.
Another Group Decode ROM signal indicates that bit 3 of the instruction should select byte or word; this
is used for the <code>MOV</code> instructions with opcodes Bx.
Yet another Group Decode ROM signal indicates that inverted bit 1 of the instruction should select byte or word;
this is used for a few opcodes, including <code>80</code>-<code>87</code>.</p>
<p>The important thing here is that for the opcodes under discussion (<code>80</code>-<code>83</code>), the <code>L8</code> micro-condition uses <em>both</em> bits 0 and 1
to determine if the instruction is 8 bits or not.
The result is that only opcode <code>81</code> is considered 16-bit by the <code>L8</code> test, so it is the only one that uses two immediate bytes
from the instruction.
However, the register operations use only bit 0 to select a byte or word transfer.
The result is that opcode <code>83</code> has the unusual behavior of using an 8-bit immediate operand with a 16-bit register.
In this case, the 8-bit value is sign-extended to form a 16-bit value. That is, the top bit of the 8-bit value fills
the entire upper half of the 16-bit value,
converting an 8-bit signed value to a 16-bit signed value (e.g. -1 is <code>FF</code>, which becomes <code>FFFF</code>).
This makes sense for arithmetic operations, but not much sense for logical operations.</p>
<p>Intel documentation is inconsistent about which opcodes are listed for which instructions.
Intel opcode maps generally define opcodes <code>80</code>-<code>83</code>.
However, lists of specific instructions show opcodes <code>80</code>, <code>81</code>, and <code>83</code> for arithmetic operations but only <code>80</code> and <code>81</code> for logical operations.<span id="fnref:immed"><a href="#fn:immed">8</a></span>
That is, Intel omits the redundant <code>82</code> opcode as well as omitting logic operations that perform sign-extension (<code>83</code>).</p>
<h3>More <code>FE</code> holes</h3>
<p>For the "group 2" instructions, the <code>FE</code> opcode performs a byte operation while <code>FF</code> performs a word operation.
Many of these operations don't make sense for bytes: <code>CALL</code>, <code>JMP</code>, and <code>PUSH</code>.
(The only instructions supported for <code>FE</code> are <code>INC</code> and <code>DEC</code>.) But what happens if you use the unsupported instructions?
The remainder of this section examines those cases and shows that the results are not useful.</p>
<h4><code>CALL</code>: <code>FE/2</code></h4>
<p>This instruction performs an indirect subroutine call within a segment, reading the target address from the memory location specified by the ModR/M byte.</p>
<p>The microcode below is a bit convoluted because the code falls through into the shared <code>NEARCALL</code> routine, so there is
some unnecessary register movement.
Before this microcode executes, the appropriate ModR/M micro-subroutine will read the target address from memory.
The code below copies the destination address from <code>M</code> to <code>tmpB</code> and stores it into the PC later in the code
to transfer execution.
The code suspends prefetching, corrects the PC to cancel the offset from prefetching, and flushes the prefetch queue.
Finally, it decrements the SP by two and writes the old PC to the stack.</p>
<pre>M → tmpB    SUSP        <span><b>CALL rm</b>: read value, suspend prefetch</span>
SP → IND    CORR        <span>Get SP, correct PC</span>
PC → OPR    DEC2 tmpC   <span>Get PC to write, set up decrement</span>
tmpB → PC   FLUSH       <span><b>NEARCALL</b>: Update PC, flush prefetch</span>
IND → tmpC              <span>Get SP to decrement</span>
Σ → IND                 <span>Decremented SP to IND</span>
Σ → SP      W SS,P0 RNI <span>Update SP, write old PC to stack</span>
</pre>

<p>This code will mess up in two ways when executed as a byte instruction.
First, when the destination address is read from memory, only a byte will be read, so the destination address will be corrupted.
(I think that the behavior here depends on the bus hardware. The 8086 will ask for a byte from memory but will
read the word that is placed on the bus.
Thus, if memory returns a word, this part may operate correctly.
The 8088's behavior will be different because of its 8-bit bus.)
The second issue is writing the old PC to the stack because only a byte of the PC will be written.
Thus, when the code returns from the subroutine call, the return address will be corrupt.</p>
<h4><code>CALL</code>: <code>FE/3</code></h4>
<p>This instruction performs an indirect subroutine call between segments, reading the target address from the memory location specified by the ModR/M byte.</p>
<pre>IND → tmpC  INC2 tmpC    <span><b>CALL FAR rm</b>: set up IND+2</span>
Σ → IND     R DS,P0      <span>Read new CS, update IND</span>
OPR → tmpA  DEC2 tmpC    <span>New CS to tmpA, set up SP-2</span>
SP → tmpC   SUSP         <span><b>FARCALL</b>: Suspend prefetch</span>
Σ → IND     CORR         <span><b>FARCALL2</b>: Update IND, correct PC</span>
CS → OPR    W SS,M2      <span>Push old CS, decrement IND by 2</span>
tmpA → CS   PASS tmpC    <span>Update CS, set up for NEARCALL</span>
PC → OPR    JMP NEARCALL <span>Continue with NEARCALL</span>
</pre>

<p>As in the previous <code>CALL</code>, this microcode will fail in multiple ways when executed in byte mode.
The new CS and PC addresses will be read from memory as bytes, which may or may not work.
Only a byte of the old CS and PC will be pushed to the stack.</p>
<h4><code>JMP</code>: <code>FE/4</code></h4>
<p>This instruction performs an indirect jump within a segment, reading the target address from the memory location specified by the ModR/M byte.
The microcode is short, since the ModR/M micro-subroutine does most of the work.
I believe this will have the same problem as the previous <code>CALL</code> instructions, that it will attempt to read a byte from
memory instead of a word.</p>
<pre>        SUSP       <span><b>JMP rm</b>: Suspend prefetch</span>
M → PC  FLUSH RNI  <span>Update PC with new address, flush prefetch, done</span>
</pre>

<h4><code>JMP</code>: <code>FE/5</code></h4>
<p>This instruction performs an indirect jump between segments, reading the new PC and CS values from the memory location specified by the ModR/M byte.
The ModR/M micro-subroutine reads the new PC address. This microcode increments <code>IND</code> and suspends prefetching.
It updates the PC, reads the new CS value from memory, and updates the CS.
As before, the reads from memory will read bytes instead of words, so this code will not meaningfully work in byte mode.</p>
<pre>IND → tmpC  INC2 tmpC   <span><b>JMP FAR rm</b>: set up IND+2</span>
Σ → IND     SUSP        <span>Update IND, suspend prefetch</span>
tmpB → PC   R DS,P0     <span>Update PC, read new CS from memory</span>
OPR → CS    FLUSH RNI   <span>Update CS, flush prefetch, done</span>
</pre>

<h4><code>PUSH</code>: <code>FE/6</code></h4>
<p>This instruction pushes the register or memory value specified by the ModR/M byte.
It decrements the SP by 2 and then writes the value to the stack.
It will write one byte to the stack but decrements the SP by 2,
so one byte of old stack data will be on the stack along with the data byte.</p>
<pre>SP → tmpA  DEC2 tmpA    <span><b>PUSH rm</b>: Set up SP decrement </span>
Σ → IND                 <span>Decremented value to IND</span>
Σ → SP                  <span>Decremented value to SP</span>
M → OPR    W SS,P0 RNI  <span>Write the data to the stack</span>
</pre>

<h2>Undocumented instruction values</h2>
<p>The next category of undocumented instructions is where the first byte indicates a valid instruction, but
there is something wrong with the second byte.</p>
<h3><code>AAM</code>: ASCII Adjust after Multiply</h3>
<p>The <code>AAM</code> instruction is a fairly obscure one, designed to support binary-coded decimal
arithmetic (BCD).
After multiplying two BCD digits, you end up with a binary value between 0 and <code>81</code> (0×0 to 9×9).
If you want a BCD result, the <code>AAM</code> instruction converts this binary value to BCD, for instance splitting <code>81</code> into the
decimal digits 8 and 1, where the upper digit is <code>81</code> divided by <code>10</code>, and the lower digit is <code>81</code> modulo <code>10</code>.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about <code>AAM</code> is that the 2-byte instruction is <code>D4</code> <code>0A</code>. You might notice that hex <code>0A</code> is <code>10</code>, and this
is not a coincidence.
There wasn't an easy way to get the value <code>10</code> in the microcode, so instead they made the instruction
provide that value in the second byte.
The undocumented (but well-known) part is that if you provide a value other than <code>10</code>, the instruction will convert the binary input into
digits in that base. For example, if you provide 8 as the second byte, the instruction returns the value divided by 8
and the value modulo 8.</p>
<p>The microcode for <code>AAM</code>, below, sets up the registers.  calls
the <code>CORD</code> (Core Division) micro-subroutine to perform the division,
and then puts the results into <code>AH</code> and <code>AL</code>.
In more detail, the <code>CORD</code> routine divides <code>tmpA/tmpC</code> by <code>tmpB</code>, putting the <em>complement</em> of the quotient in <code>tmpC</code> and leaving the remainder in <code>tmpA</code>.
(If you want to know how CORD works internally, see my <a href="https://www.righto.com/2023/04/reverse-engineering-8086-divide-microcode.html">division post</a>.)
The important step is that the <code>AAM</code> microcode gets the divisor from the prefetch queue (<code>Q</code>).
After calling <code>CORD</code>, it sets up the ALU to perform a 1's complement of <code>tmpC</code> and puts the result (<code>Σ</code>) into <code>AH</code>.
It sets up the ALU to pass <code>tmpA</code> through unchanged, puts the result (<code>Σ</code>) into <code>AL</code>, and updates the flags accordingly (<code>F</code>).</p>
<pre>Q → tmpB                    <span><b>AAM:</b> Move byte from prefetch to tmpB</span>
ZERO → tmpA                 <span>Move 0 to tmpA</span>
AL → tmpC    CALL CORD      <span>Move AL to tmpC, call CORD.</span>
             COM1 tmpC      <span>Set ALU to complement</span>
Σ → AH       PASS tmpA, NXT <span>Complement AL to AH</span>
Σ → AL       RNI F          <span>Pass tmpA through ALU to set flags</span>
</pre>

<p>The interesting thing is why this code has undocumented behavior.
The 8086's microcode only has support for the constants 0 and all-1's (<code>FF</code> or <code>FFFF</code>), but the microcode needs to divide by <code>10</code>.
One solution would be to implement an additional micro-instruction and more circuitry to provide the constant <code>10</code>, but every
transistor was precious back then.
Instead, the designers took the approach of simply putting the number <code>10</code> as the second byte of the instruction and loading the
constant from there.
Since the <code>AAM</code> instruction is not used very much, making the instruction two bytes long wasn't much of a drawback.
But if you put a different number in the second byte, that's the divisor the microcode will use.
(Of course you could add circuitry to verify that the number is <code>10</code>, but then the implementation is no longer simple.)</p>
<p>Intel could have documented the full behavior, but that creates several problems.
First, Intel would be stuck supporting the full behavior into the future.
Second, there are corner cases to deal with, such as divide-by-zero.
Third, testing the chip would become harder because all these cases would need to be tested.
Fourth, the documentation would become long and confusing.
It's not surprising that Intel left the full behavior undocumented.</p>
<h3><code>AAD</code>: ASCII Adjust before Division</h3>
<p>The <code>AAD</code> instruction is analogous to <code>AAM</code> but used for BCD division.
In this case, you want to divide a two-digit BCD number by something, where the BCD digits are in <code>AH</code> and <code>AL</code>.
The <code>AAD</code> instruction converts the two-digit BCD number to binary by computing <code>AH</code>×<code>10+AL</code>, before you perform
the division.</p>
<p>The microcode for <code>AAD</code> is shown below. The microcode sets up the registers, calls the multiplication micro-subroutine
<code>CORX</code> (Core Times), and
then puts the results in <code>AH</code> and <code>AL</code>.
In more detail, the multiplier comes from the instruction prefetch queue <code>Q</code>.
The <code>CORX</code> routine multiples <code>tmpC</code> by <code>tmpB</code>, putting the result in <code>tmpA/tmpC</code>.
Then the microcode adds the low BCD digit (<code>AL</code>) to the product (<code>tmpB + tmpC</code>), putting the sum (<code>Σ</code>) into <code>AL</code>,
clearing <code>AH</code> and setting the status flags <code>F</code> appropriately.</p>
<p>One interesting thing is that the second-last micro-instruction jumps to <code>AAEND</code>, which is the last
micro-instruction of the <code>AAM</code> microcode above.
By reusing the micro-instruction from <code>AAM</code>, the microcode is one micro-instruction shorter, but
the jump adds one cycle to the execution time.
(The CORX routine is used for integer multiplication; I discuss the internals in <a href="https://www.righto.com/2023/03/8086-multiplication-microcode.html">this post</a>.)</p>
<pre>Q → tmpC              <span><b>AAD:</b> Get byte from prefetch queue.</span>
AH → tmpB   CALL CORX <span>Call CORX</span>
AL → tmpB   ADD tmpC  <span>Set ALU for ADD</span>
ZERO → AH   JMP AAEND <span>Zero AH, jump to AAEND</span>
i
...
Σ → AL      RNI F     <span><b>AAEND:</b> Sum to AL, done.</span>
</pre>

<p>As with <code>AAM</code>, the constant <code>10</code> is provided in the second byte of the instruction.
The microcode accepts any value here, but values other than <code>10</code> are undocumented.</p>
<h3><code>8C</code>, <code>8E</code>: MOV sr</h3>
<p>The opcodes <code>8C</code> and <code>8E</code> perform a <code>MOV</code> register to or from the specified segment register, using the register specification
field in the ModR/M byte.
There are four segment registers and three selection bits, so an invalid segment register can be specified.
However, the hardware that decodes the register number ignores instruction bit 5 for a segment register. Thus,
specifying a segment register 4 to 7 is the same as specifying a segment register 0 to 3.
For more details, see my article on <a href="https://www.righto.com/2023/03/8086-register-codes.html">8086 register codes</a>.</p>
<h2>Unexpected <code>REP</code> prefix</h2>
<h3><code>REP IMUL</code> / <code>IDIV</code></h3>
<p>The <code>REP</code> prefix is used with string operations to cause the operation to be repeated across a block of memory.
However, if you use this prefix with an <code>IMUL</code> or <code>IDIV</code> instruction, it has the unexpected behavior
of negating the product or the quotient (<a href="https://www.reenigne.org/blog/8086-microcode-disassembled/">source</a>).</p>
<p>The reason for this behavior is that the string operations use an internal flag called <code>F1</code> to indicate that a <code>REP</code>
prefix has been applied.
The multiply and divide code reuses this flag to track the sign of the input values, toggling <code>F1</code> for each negative value.
If <code>F1</code> is set, the value at the end is negated. (This handles "two negatives make a positive.")
The consequence is that the <code>REP</code> prefix puts the flag in the 1 state when the multiply/divide starts, so the computed sign
will be wrong at the end and the result is the negative of the expected result.
The microcode is fairly complex, so I won't show it here; I explain it in detail in <a href="https://www.righto.com/2023/03/8086-multiplication-microcode.html">this blog post</a>.</p>
<h3><code>REP RET</code></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#Undocumented_x86_instructions">Wikipedia</a> lists
<code>REP RET</code> (i.e. <code>RET</code> with a <code>REP</code> prefix) as a way to implement a two-byte return instruction.
This is kind of trivial; the <code>RET</code> microcode (like almost every instruction) doesn't use the <code>F1</code> internal flag,
so the <code>REP</code> prefix has no effect.</p>
<h3><code>REPNZ MOVS/STOS</code></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#Undocumented_x86_instructions">Wikipedia</a> mentions that
the use of the <code>REPNZ</code> prefix (as opposed to <code>REPZ</code>) is undefined with string operations other than <code>CMPS/SCAS</code>.
An internal flag called <code>F1Z</code> distinguishes between the <code>REPZ</code> and <code>REPNZ</code> prefixes.
This flag is only used by <code>CMPS/SCAS</code>. Since the other string instructions ignore this flag, they will ignore the
difference between <code>REPZ</code> and <code>REPNZ</code>.
I wrote about string operations in more detail in <a href="https://www.righto.com/2023/04/8086-microcode-string-operations.html">this post</a>.</p>
<h2>Using a register instead of memory.</h2>
<p>Some instructions are documented as requiring a memory operand. However, the ModR/M byte can specify a register.
The behavior in these cases can be highly unusual, providing access to hidden registers.
Examining the microcode shows how this happens.</p>
<h3><code>LEA reg</code></h3>
<p>Many instructions have a ModR/M byte that indicates the memory address that the instruction should use, perhaps through
a complicated addressing mode.
The <code>LEA</code> (Load Effective Address) instruction is different: it doesn't access the memory location but returns the address itself.
The undocumented part is that the ModR/M byte can specify a register instead of a memory location. In that case,
what does the <code>LEA</code> instruction do? Obviously it can't return the address of a register, but it needs to return something.</p>
<p>The behavior of <code>LEA</code> is explained by how the 8086 handles the ModR/M byte.
Before running the microcode corresponding to the instruction, the microcode engine calls a short micro-subroutine
for the particular addressing mode.
This micro-subroutine puts the desired memory address (the effective address) into the <code>tmpA</code> register.
The effective address is copied to the <code>IND</code> (Indirect) register and the value is loaded from memory if needed.
On the other hand, if the ModR/M byte specified a register instead of memory, no micro-subroutine is called.
(I explain ModR/M handling in more detail in <a href="https://www.righto.com/2023/02/8086-modrm-addressing.html">this article</a>.)</p>
<p>The microcode for <code>LEA</code> itself is just one line. It stores the effective address in the <code>IND</code> register into the specified destination register, indicated by <code>N</code>.
This assumes that the appropriate ModR/M micro-subroutine was called before this code, putting the effective address into <code>IND</code>.</p>
<pre>IND → N   RNI  <span><b>LEA</b>: store IND register in destination, done</span>
</pre>

<p>But if a register was specified instead of a memory location, no ModR/M micro-subroutine gets called.
Instead, the <code>LEA</code> instruction will return whatever value was left
in <code>IND</code> from before, typically the previous memory location that was accessed.
Thus, <code>LEA</code> can be used to read the value of the <code>IND</code> register, which is normally hidden from the programmer.</p>
<h3><code>LDS reg</code>, <code>LES reg</code></h3>
<p>The <code>LDS</code> and <code>LES</code> instructions load a far pointer from memory into the specified segment register and general-purpose register.
The microcode below assumes that the appropriate ModR/M micro-subroutine has set up <code>IND</code> and read the first value into <code>OPR</code>.
The microcode updates the destination register, increments <code>IND</code> by 2, reads the next value, and updates <code>DS</code>.
(The microcode for <code>LES</code> is a copy of this, but updates <code>ES</code>.)</p>
<pre>OPR → N               <span><b>LDS</b>: Copy OPR to dest register</span>
IND → tmpC  INC2 tmpC <span>Set up incrementing IND by 2</span>
Σ → IND     R DS,P0   <span>Update IND, read next location</span>
OPR → DS    RNI       <span>Update DS</span>
</pre>

<p>If the <code>LDS</code> instruction specifies a register instead of memory, a micro-subroutine will not be called, so <code>IND</code> and <code>OPR</code>
will have values from a previous instruction.
<code>OPR</code> will be stored in the destination register, while the <code>DS</code> value will be read from the address <code>IND+2</code>.
Thus, these instructions provide a mechanism to access the hidden <code>OPR</code> register.</p>
<h3><code>JMP FAR rm</code></h3>
<p>The <code>JMP FAR rm</code> instruction normally jumps to the far address stored in memory at the location indicated by the ModR/M byte.
(That is, the ModR/M byte indicates where the new PC and CS values are stored.)
But, as with <code>LEA</code>, the behavior is undocumented if the ModR/M byte specifies a register, since a register doesn't hold
a four-byte value.</p>
<p>The microcode explains what happens.
As with <code>LEA</code>, the code expects a micro-subroutine to put the address into the <code>IND</code> register.
In this case, the micro-subroutine also loads the value at that address (i.e. the destination <code>PC</code>) into tmpB.
The microcode increments <code>IND</code> by 2 to point to the <code>CS</code> word in memory and reads that into <code>CS</code>.
Meanwhile, it updates the <code>PC</code> with <code>tmpB</code>.
It suspends prefetching and flushes the queue, so instruction fetching will restart at the new address.</p>
<pre>IND → tmpC  INC2 tmpC   <span><b>JMP FAR rm</b>: set up to add 2 to IND</span>
Σ → IND     SUSP        <span>Update IND, suspend prefetching</span>
tmpB → PC   R DS,P0     <span>Update PC with tmpB. Read new CS from specified address</span>
OPR → CS    FLUSH RNI   <span>Update CS, flush queue, done</span>
</pre>

<p>If you specify a register instead of memory, the micro-subroutine won't get called.
Instead, the program counter will be loaded with whatever value was in <code>tmpB</code> and the <code>CS</code> segment register will
be loaded from the memory location two bytes after the location that <code>IND</code> was referencing.
Thus, this undocumented use of the instruction gives access to the otherwise-hidden <code>tmpB</code> register.</p>

<p>Microprocessor manufacturers soon realized that undocumented instructions were a problem, since
programmers find them and often use them.
This creates an issue for future processors, or even revisions of the current processor:
if you eliminate an undocumented instruction, previously-working code that used the instruction will break,
and it will seem like the new processor is faulty.</p>
<p>The solution was for processors to detect undocumented instructions and prevent them from executing.
By the early 1980s, processors had enough transistors (thanks to Moore's law) that they could include
the circuitry to block unsupported instructions.
In particular, the 80186/80188 and the 80286 generated a trap of type 6 when an unused opcode was executed,
blocking use of the instruction.<span id="fnref:186"><a href="#fn:186">9</a></span>
This trap is also known as #UD (Undefined instruction trap).<span id="fnref:fault"><a href="#fn:fault">10</a></span></p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The 8086, like many early microprocessors, has undocumented instructions but no traps to stop them from executing.<span id="fnref:references"><a href="#fn:references">11</a></span>
For the 8086, these fall into several categories.
Many undocumented instructions simply mirror existing instructions.
Some instructions are implemented but not documented for one reason or another, such as <code>SALC</code> and <code>POP CS</code>.
Other instructions can be used outside their normal range, such as <code>AAM</code> and <code>AAD</code>.
Some instructions are intended to work only with a memory address, so specifying a register can have
strange effects such as revealing the values of the hidden <code>IND</code> and <code>OPR</code> registers.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that my analysis is based on transistor-level simulation and examining the microcode; I haven't verified the behavior on a
physical 8086 processor. Please let me know if you see any errors in my analysis or undocumented instructions that I have
overlooked.
Also note that the behavior could change between different versions of the 8086; in particular, some versions by different manufacturers
(such as the NEC V20 and V30) are known to be different.</p>
<p>I plan to write more about the 8086, so
follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/kenshirriff">@kenshirriff</a> or <a href="https://www.righto.com/feeds/posts/default">RSS</a> for updates.
I've also started experimenting with Mastodon recently as <a href="https://oldbytes.space/@kenshirriff">@<span data-cfemail="fe959b908d96978c8c979898be91929a9c878a9b8dd08d8e9f9d9b">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>
