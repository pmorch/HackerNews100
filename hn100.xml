<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body">
<p>To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the launch of Doom, id Software co-founders John Carmack and John Romero <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2000693432" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2000693432">reunited to talk about the legendary FPS</a>. The discussion was moderated by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://linktr.ee/davidlcraddock" target="_blank" data-url="https://linktr.ee/davidlcraddock">David Craddock</a> (The FPS Documentary, Long Live Mortal Kombat), with interview questions from Craddock and the Twitch chat.</p><p>The conversation was understandably warm and celebratory, but I was also surprised at how critical the two were of their own work. Carmack alluded to "flashier" (and potentially technically riskier) graphical effects he wishes he had built into Doom's engine, and he noted that he thinks the more grounded, military sci-fi aesthetic of Episode One has aged better than the abstract hellscapes later in the game.</p><p>Romero, meanwhile, contrasted Doom with the id games before and after, arguing it represented a technical "sweet spot" before Quake and full 3D acceleration started to seriously complicate development and limit how many enemies they could fit on screen. The developer praised Doom's engine for allowing more complex maps than Wolfenstein though, ruefully remarking that "Making levels for Wolfenstein had to be the most boring level design job ever."</p><p>The two also fondly reminisced about the technical limitations of the time. Carmack remarked that, although he thought id could "just sell [Doom] in a brown paper bag" off its quality alone, he was glad they went the extra mile with its iconic box art and marketing. Both devs expressed an appreciation for '90s PC big box packaging and accompanying "feelies" like cloth maps, and I'm 100% with them on that.</p><p>As far as development stories, I was struck by Romero's recollection of getting multiplayer working for the first time shortly before Doom's release: "I went into my office—I was making E1M7 at the time—I'm looking out the window and I'm seeing two characters fighting, rockets are flying up at a high window and someone is plasma gunning the other guy.</p><p>And I'm like, this is going to be the coolest fucking game the planet has ever seen, I can't wait to play that."</p><iframe width="620" height="378" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2000693432&amp;parent=www.pcgamer.com"></iframe><p>"I've said before that I'm not a very sentimental person, that I don't spend a lot of time reminiscing about the good old days," Carmack confided as a means of farewell, "But they were really quite good. I'm very proud of the things that we built back then and that they have this legacy that's lasted to this day."</p><p>Romero echoed the sentiment, thanking Carmack for the years they spent working together, and also extending his appreciation to the players who keep coming back to Doom: "I want to thank everybody in the Doom community for keeping this game alive. And really, just thank you for playing our games everybody."</p><p>You can check out the conversation in its entirety on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2000693432" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2000693432">John Romero's Twitch channel</a>, and it's also a perfect time to dive into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://romero.com/sigil" target="_blank" data-url="https://romero.com/sigil">Sigil 2</a>, the sequel to Romero's 2019 Doom megawad and subject of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/pc-gamer-magazines-latest-issue-on-sale-now-sigil-ii-and-dooms-30th-anniversary/" target="_blank" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/pc-gamer-magazines-latest-issue-on-sale-now-sigil-ii-and-dooms-30th-anniversary//">PC Gamer's latest print cover story</a>.

            <pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2023 22:52:55 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://rknight.me/please-expose-your-rss/">https://rknight.me/please-expose-your-rss/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38595855">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>



<span data-pagefind-body="">
	<p>Earlier this week I had a need to manually find a bunch of people's RSS feed links. It seemed simple enough: go to their website and look for an RSS/Subscribe link but I was surprised to find that a lot of people don't have a link anywhere to their feed.</p>
<p>Even if people only ever add your website into their feed reader and let the app find the RSS feed (see below for more info on this), showing an RSS link reminds people that RSS exists, a win for the open web.</p>
<p>My second step when finding a link failed was to use this handy JS snippet from my <a href="https://podduration.rknight.me/">Podcast Duration project</a>:</p>
<pre><code><span>return</span> Array<span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span>document<span>.</span><span>getElementsByTagName</span><span>(</span><span>'link'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>find</span><span>(</span><span>l</span> <span>=&gt;</span> l<span>.</span>type<span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>'application/rss+xml'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>?.</span>href</code></pre>
<p>This looks for a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag on the website that has a type of <code>application/rss+xml</code>. This is called RSS auto-discovery and is a standard way to expose RSS feeds to help <a href="https://www.rssboard.org/rss-autodiscovery">browsers and other software to automatically find a site's RSS feed</a>.</p>
<p>Like the standard link, a lot of sites were also missing this. This is (at least as a first step) what feed reeders like <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a> will use to automatically find a feed when you paste in a URL. If you have an RSS feed, you should have the following in the <code>head</code> of your website:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>alternate<span>"</span></span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>application/rss+xml<span>"</span></span> <span>title</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>My Cool Website<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com/feed.xml<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><p><span>&lt;!-- use application/atom+xml for an atom feed --&gt;</span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>alternate<span>"</span></span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>application/atom+xml<span>"</span></span> <span>title</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>My Cool Website<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com/atom.xml<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></p></code></pre>
<p>If you have multiple feeds, you can have more than one <code>link</code> tag that links to those feeds as well. For example, say you have a <a href="https://www.jsonfeed.org/">JSON feed</a> and a podcast feed you want to link to:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!-- Website RSS feed --&gt;</span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>alternate<span>"</span></span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>application/rss+xml<span>"</span></span> <span>title</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>My Cool Website<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com/feed.xml<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><p><span>&lt;!-- Website JSON feed --&gt;</span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>alternate<span>"</span></span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>application/json<span>"</span></span> <span>title</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>My Cool Website but JSON<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com/feed.json<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></p><p><span>&lt;!-- Podcast RSS feed --&gt;</span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>alternate<span>"</span></span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>application/rss+xml<span>"</span></span> <span>title</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>My Cool Podcast<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://example.com/podcast.xml<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></p></code></pre>
<p>Please, expose your RSS.</p>
<p>Update 2023-12-09 via <a href="https://bne.social/@james/111545470669286673">James</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if you're going to add an RSS button, please ensure it looks like an RSS button and is in RSS orange</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an excellent idea and I have done so here.</p>

<p>It’s 1995 and I’ve been nearly two years in the professional workspace. OS/2 is the dominant workstation product, Netware servers rule the world, and the year of the Linux desktop is going to happen any moment now. If you weren’t running OS/2, you were probably running Windows 3.1, only very few people were using that Linux thing. What would have been the prefect OS at the time would have been NT with a competent POSIX subsystem, but since we were denied that, enter Hiroshi Oota with BSD on Windows.</p>
<p>It was a late night browsing yahoo auctions Japan as one does, laughing at the absurd Famicom/Super Famicom games, and I went ahead and looked for BSD CD-ROMS, where I first came across BSD on Windows. And then I’d forgotten about it and went to work on some Darwin projects.</p>
<p>Fast forward 3 weeks, and <a href="https://archive.org/details/@vic485">vic485</a> had bought it, had it shipped, and uploaded on <a href="https://archive.org/details/bsd-on-windows">archive.org</a>. So a big super thanks to vic485 for making this all possible!</p>
<div>
<figure><a href="https://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/winmem32-required-for-bow.png"><img decoding="async" width="449" height="163" src="https://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/winmem32-required-for-bow.png" alt="" srcset="http://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/winmem32-required-for-bow.png 449w, http://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/winmem32-required-for-bow-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px"></a></figure></div>
<p>So what is it? It’s not quite BSD, its a bunch of 16bit DLL’s that broke the kernel down into subsystems, that each rely on winmem32.dll to give access to flat/32bit address space. BSD on Windows (BOW) being a hybrid 16/32bit app is originally for Windows 3.1, with the later 1.5 update for Windows 95, which includes support for long filenames. I’m not sure if it’ll run on Windows NT or OS/2, as I don’t think </p>
<p>So what do you get?</p>

<p>The key media contents are the install floppy and the CD-ROM. Yes the setup program IS only on the floppy. Hope you get that disk image. I’m unsure what the manual is like, other than of course it is in Japanese.</p>

<p>It’s very much a single user mode BSD like environment complete with vi/gcc/csh/perl just to name a few. I’ve been able to test job control, and building some simple programs like <a href="https://archive.org/details/hack-103-for-bow">Hack 1.03</a>. I found a few issues however.</p>
<p>I haven’t tested enough with FreeBSD 1/2 but I can verify that from my ‘<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/linux011/">Ancient Linux on Windows</a>‘ packages, the object format is the same, which is that early era when everything was a.out, although all different the reliance on GNU GAS &amp; LD did make the object format the same. And it was nice to compile a hello world from my Linux cross compiler, link it on BOW, and get a running executable.</p>
<p>The memory is weird, in that you can add hundreds of megabytes to Windows and BOW will always run exhausted. In the bow.ini file you can set the heap for each program, and I found out from some silly trial and error that the maximum heap you can effectively give is 13 megabytes. It seems that winmem32 has a single chunk of memory where all processes run out of, hence the sub 16mb ram zone. Maybe there is a way to allocate it, but I’m unsure, maybe it’s in the book. CC1 was frequently having issues, so setting it’s heap to 13M sure helped, the linker ‘ld’ of course was running out of memory as well so setting it to 8M got me linking.</p>
<p>Filenames, especially on Windows 3.1 are a huge problem. All the LFN TSR’s I tried to load just resulted in a full crash. I had to point the linker to the CD-ROM live filesystem, which maybe would be tedious on a real machine, but under emulation it’s fine.</p>
<p>BOW does NOT like Qemu. At all. It won’t under otvdm either. I suspect NT is a no go but I haven’t tried. Oddly enough it’s not a timing issue, as it does run under VMware. There is an advantage to running it under Windows 95, is that it supports long filenames. 86Box works as well, I even was using the Pentium II Xeon at 400Mhz and that ran fine.</p>
<p>Probably the most annoying and silly thing is that the GCC C compiler doesn’t have C++ style comments turned on. Not being able to use ‘//’ is quite annoying.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/neozeed/hack-1.03">Hack</a> ran fine on my 386, which was a pleasant surprise!. It was really cool to have Word+Excel and Hack running at the same time. </p>
<p>Had I known about this, it would have been an incredible bridge product. Not to mention cross compiling to even Win32, or Linux. Not to mention at the time being able to run BSD with no real pain, just install and go</p>

<p>There is generic TCP/IP Winsock support in BOW 1.5 as it simply calls winsock. This also includes the ability to run daemons, however limitations in BOW are quickly exposed, such as missing setuid/setgid sno there is no ability to impersonate lower privileged users. MMAP stuff also doesn’t seem to work, although I was able to build a super simple port of Apache 1.3.1 to BSD on Windows (BOW).&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="745" src="https://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Apache-on-BOW-1024x745.png" alt="" srcset="http://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Apache-on-BOW-1024x745.png 1024w, http://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Apache-on-BOW-300x218.png 300w, http://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Apache-on-BOW-768x559.png 768w, http://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Apache-on-BOW-412x300.png 412w, http://virtuallyfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Apache-on-BOW.png 1208w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>While BOW may appear to be very BSD like, there is a lack of a the mmap Apache needs, along with user mapping &amp; impersonation.&nbsp; I ended up using the EMX – OS/2 system code, since it’s very POSIX like without relying on the Unix like OS actually working.</p>
<p>I’ve been able to serve pages to myself, however BOW crashing out many emulators and hypervisors kind of stops me from putting it on the internet. BOW enthusiasts can <a href="https://archive.org/details/apache131_for_BOW">download it from archive.org</a></p>
<p>Today, there is really no point to BOW, it’s an interesting oddity, but back in the day, for a jr network administrator being able to run the Unix version of the snmp tools, even if it’s only client side would have been great. If tftpd could be built to run this would have been beyond amazing, as you not only get BSD, but full Windows apps at the same time, much like MachTen.</p>
<p>It’s a shame I never knew this was a thing, I certainly would have been evangelizing BOW! Who knows what other treasures are in the parallel societies of Japan/Asia/Europe?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-js-content="true" data-js-dom="toc"><p><em><strong>Quick take:</strong> How do you spend your time at work and what is it costing you? Slack’s Workforce Index, based on survey responses from more than 10,000 desk workers around the globe, uncovers new findings on how to structure the workday to maximize productivity and strengthen employee well-being and satisfaction. </em></p>
<p>Key learnings include:</p>
<ul><li>Employees who log off at the end of the workday register 20% higher productivity scores than those who feel obligated to work after hours.</li>
<li>Making time for breaks during the workday improves employee productivity and well-being, and yet half of all desk workers say they rarely or never take breaks.</li>
<li>On average, desk workers say that the ideal amount of focus time is around four hours a day, and more than two hours a day in meetings is the tipping point at which a majority of workers feel overburdened by meetings.</li>
<li>Three out of every four desk workers report working in the 3 to 6pm timeframe, but of those, only one in four consider these hours highly productive.</li>
</ul>

<p>For decades, putting in extra hours at the office was seen by many as a sign of hard work and productivity, even a badge of honor. But new research from Slack shows despite that longstanding perception, working after hours is more often associated with <em>lower</em> levels of productivity—and could be a red flag that an employee is juggling too many tasks and needs help prioritizing and balancing their time.</p>
<p>The latest results from the Workforce Index, Slack’s survey of more than 10,000 desk workers, show the productivity gap depends on what’s driving workers to burn the midnight (or early morning) oil. About two out of every five desk workers (37%) are logging on outside of their company’s standard hours at least weekly, and more than half (54%) of these workers say it’s because they feel pressured to, not because they choose to.</p>
<p>Employees who feel <em>obligated</em> to work after-hours register 20% lower productivity scores than those who log off at the end of the standard workday. They also report:</p>
<ul><li>2.1x worse work-related stress</li>
<li>1.7x times lower satisfaction with their overall working environment</li>
<li>2x greater burnout</li>
</ul>
<section><figure><img alt="Employees who feel pressured to work after hours report 20% lower productivity throughout the day" loading="lazy" data-src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/Workforce-Lab-Blog-Graphics-Pulse-11_V2_After-Hours-Horchata.png" data-srcset="" src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/Workforce-Lab-Blog-Graphics-Pulse-11_V2_After-Hours-Horchata.png"></figure></section>
<p>Both groups say around 70% of their time spent working is productive—a sign that those working extra hours are putting in as much effort as their colleagues—but those who work after hours are 50% more likely to say their productivity is blocked by competing priorities compared to those who log a standard workday.</p>
<p>On the flip side, employees who work outside of standard hours by choice, to better suit their schedule or to pursue personal ambitions, report no negative impacts and even a slight uptick in their wellness and productivity scores.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>“We’ve long seen a focus on quantity over quality across many aspects of work, from how we spend our time to how we define productivity. Constantly feeling like you need to catch up is hurting employees and businesses. This underscores the importance of building a culture of trust where employees feel safe enough to speak up when they need help prioritizing and have the right balance of time in the work day to get work done.”</p></blockquote></div>
<h2>When it comes to productivity, it’s not quantity of time spent working, it’s quality</h2>
<p>Results from the Workforce Index show that a significant portion of desk workers across the globe are struggling to balance their time at work, with different job tiers experiencing this problem in different ways.</p>
<p>More than one in four desk workers (27%), including more than half (55%) of executives, say they spend too much time in meetings. A similar share (25%) of all desk workers, including 43% of executives, say they spend too much time in email.</p>
<p>One in five (20%) don’t have enough time to connect with coworkers, and this problem is most pronounced among more junior employees.</p>
<p>Alarmingly, the data shows that many workers across all levels are plowing through their daily tasks without any down time: Half of desk workers surveyed (50%) say they rarely or never take breaks during the workday. These workers are 1.7x more likely to experience burnout.</p>
<p>Their break-taking counterparts, on the other hand, show 62% higher scores for work-life balance, 43% greater ability to manage stress and anxiety, 43% greater overall satisfaction, and—perhaps surprisingly—13% higher scores for productivity.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>“Why did we all come to believe that we are more productive if we are always on and that we need to burn out in order to succeed? It goes back to the first Industrial Revolution, when we started revering machines. The goal of machines is to minimize downtime. But for the human operating system, downtime is not a bug, it’s a feature. Elite athletes know that recovery is part of peak performance. Downtime is a productivity multiplier.”</p></blockquote></div><section><figure><img alt="Workers who regularly take breaks have 13% higher productivity" loading="lazy" data-src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/Workforce-Lab-Blog-Graphics-Pulse-11_V2_Taking-Breaks-Horchata.png" data-srcset="" src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/Workforce-Lab-Blog-Graphics-Pulse-11_V2_Taking-Breaks-Horchata.png"></figure></section>
<h2>Prime productivity hours: Whether you’re a morning person or a night owl, the afternoon slump is real</h2>
<p>On average, desk workers say that 70% of their time at work is productive. When asked about prime hours for productivity, answers vary widely, with some desk workers preferring the morning and others preferring the evening. But no matter their preference, a majority (71%) of desk workers agree that the late afternoon is the worst time for work, with productivity plummeting between the hours of 3 and 6pm.</p>
<section><figure><img alt="" loading="lazy" data-src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/Workforce-Lab-Blog-Graphics-Pulse-11_V2_Afternoon-Slump-Purple.png" data-srcset="" src="https://d34u8crftukxnk.cloudfront.net/slackpress/prod/sites/6/Workforce-Lab-Blog-Graphics-Pulse-11_V2_Afternoon-Slump-Purple.png"></figure></section>
<p>While three out of every four desk workers report working in the 3-6pm timeframe, only one in four consider these hours highly productive.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>“This goes to show that productivity isn’t linear. Productivity happens in bursts, on and off throughout a day, not necessarily in prescribed windows of time, and definitely not for eight consecutive hours. The ‘afternoon slump’ shouldn’t be seen as a bad thing; for many workers this could be an ideal time to take that break that will boost their overall productivity for the day.”</p></blockquote></div>
<p>The most productive people use time management strategies. They are 1.6x more likely to block time to complete specific tasks, 1.7x more likely to only check email at specific times, and 2.2x more likely to set focus timers.</p>
<h2>The “Goldilocks Zone” for work: How to balance your workday to optimize your productivity</h2>
<p>While there’s no one-size-fits-all schedule that applies across all industries, roles, and job levels, a close examination of the data reveals a formula emerging to set employees up for success.</p>
<p>Regardless of job tier, the research shows a “Goldilocks Zone” for the ideal balance of focus time, collaboration time, social connection, and downtime. On average, desk workers say the ideal amount of focus time is around four hours a day. More than two hours a day in meetings is the tipping point at which a majority of workers say they’re spending “too much time” in meetings, with a similar pattern emerging across all job levels. People who say they spend too much time in meetings are more than twice as likely to say they don’t have enough time to focus.</p>
<p>In contrast, about 10% of desk workers, most common among employees with less than one year at a company and those under 30, say they spend <em>too little</em> time in meetings, and this is also associated with decreased sense of belonging and productivity.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>“Focus time, collaboration time, connection, and rest are like the macronutrients of a workday. The right balance gives you the energy you need to work your best. We cannot consider these critical components of our work in silos. To be our most effective, we must create the space for collaborative work and for focused work.”</p></blockquote></div>
<h2>What do desk workers most want from AI? Assistance and automation to rightsize the meeting load and free up time</h2>
<p>At the same time that desk workers are struggling with time management, many are also excited about the potential of AI tools to give them more command over balancing their time.</p>
<p>An overwhelming majority of executives—94%—feel some urgency to incorporate AI into their organizations, with half of executives saying they feel a strong sense of urgency. And yet, our survey shows that adoption of AI is still in its infancy, with only one in five desk workers reporting that they have used AI tools for work.</p>
<p>Given the low adoption, it’s not surprising that most desk workers (more than 80%) say that AI tools are not improving their productivity at work—yet. But they’re anticipating that AI will assist with one of the biggest struggles of the workday: meetings. The top three activities that employees expect AI will provide the most value in the future are 1) meeting notes and recaps 2) writing assistance and 3) automation of workflows.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>“People at every job level may be shocked to see that more than two hours of meetings a day reduces productivity. It may feel unrealistic to many team leaders to try to hit that target today. But that’s where the newest generation of AI tools could be a lifesaver. An AI assistant that could accurately summarize meeting notes and automate common workflows could be the key that frees up our time and helps us to unlock the balance we need to set ourselves up for success.”</p></blockquote></div>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p><em>The Workforce Index surveyed 10,333 workers in the U.S., Australia, France, Germany, Japan and the U.K. between August 24 and September 15, 2023. The survey was administered by Qualtrics and did not target Slack or Salesforce employees or customers. Respondents were all desk workers, defined as employed full-time (30 or more hours per week) and either having one of the roles listed below or saying they “work with data, analyze information or think creatively”: executive management (e.g. president/partner, CEO, CFO, C-suite), senior management (e.g. executive VP, senior VP), middle management (e.g. department/group manager, VP), junior management (e.g. manager, team leader), senior staff (i.e. non-management), skilled office worker (e.g. analyst, graphic designer). For brevity, we refer to the survey population as “desk-based” or “desk workers.”</em></p>

I don’t know why; probably a curious desire to see how bad Elon Musk would screw it up. To make it bearable from a user interface perspective I alternated between the Twitterrific<sup id="fnref-1454-ollie"><a href="#fn-1454-ollie" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup> and Tweetbot macOS apps. It was fun at first—getting back into Twitter and using a chronological timeline rather than an algorithmically generated one.</p>
<p>But the fun died when both apps suddenly lost access to Twitter on January 12, 2023. At first we third-party app fans hoped for an announcement of a temporary glitch along with reinstated access. But it turned out to be what, deep down, we knew it was all along—<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/16/twitters-third-party-client-issue-is-seemingly-a-deliberate-suspension/">Elon Musk shut down third-party API access with no warning</a>. It was a sad day, and it’s the day that, for me, Twitter died.</p>
<p>Over the course of 2023, Twitter fractured, with many people leaving to join Threads, Bluesky, or Mastodon/fediverse. I ultimately made the jump to Mastodon—but it was an accident.</p>
<h2>How I accidentally joined Mastodon</h2>
<p>About a week before Elon killed third-party Twitter clients, I had signed up for this quirky link-in-bio-plus-more service called <a href="https://home.omg.lol/">omg.lol</a>. I discovered it during what I later found out was a <a href="https://omglol.news/2023/01/07/wildest-36-hours-ever">big wave of new users coming from Hacker News</a>.</p>
<p>I joined omg.lol because of the quirky, fun vibes. I didn’t even pay attention to the fact that there was an optional Mastodon instance. Mastodon, the concept, interested me but like many others I had no idea how to sign up, what instance I should pick, etc.</p>
<p>But all of the sudden the decision was made for me—I had easy access to a smallish Mastodon instance with a lot of interesting people who, like me, had a fondness for the weird, fun internet of yore. And since it’s a paid service, I could feel like I wasn’t freeloading on some poor admin. And a paywall offers a little bit of spam protection (I’m assuming $20/yr is enough to prevent some spammy accounts from signing up).</p>
<p>I ended up trying it out and then just a week later, Elon broke Twitter. At that point I went all-in on Mastodon and haven’t looked back. I have a third as many followers as I did on Twitter but five times the engagement on my posts.<sup id="fnref-1454-stats"><a href="#fn-1454-stats" title="Read footnote.">2</a></sup> I have the choice of dozens of native and web clients. It’s awesome. I settled on <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/mac/">Ivory for macOS</a> and it’s been pretty great.</p>
<p>The instance over at <a href="https://social.lol/">social.lol</a> is full of interesting, friendly, folks. More on that in a bit.</p>
<h2>Cool stuff you get with omg.lol</h2>

<p>The main thing you are getting with omg.lol is one or more subdomains, which are referred to as addresses. For example, my primary one is <a href="https://bw.omg.lol/">bw.omg.lol</a>. Each one of your addresses comes with a slew of stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Email forwarding</strong>: You get an email address, <code>you@omg.lol</code>, which you can forward to any email address.</li>
<li><strong>Web Page</strong>: This is your link-in-bio one-pager to do whatever you want with. By default this is where your main address (eg, <code>you.omg.lol</code>) points. It’s the flagship feature of omg.lol. It comes with a markdown editor that has some <a href="https://home.omg.lol/info/editor">fancy features</a> baked into it. You get a selection of built-in themes but you also have the freedom to go wild with your own CSS.</li>
<li><strong>DNS</strong>: You have the ability to use your omg.lol subdomain however you wish by way of a friendly DNS panel.</li>
<li><strong>Now Page</strong>: This is a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">type of page</a> you can use to let people know what’s going on in your life. It’s broader than a social media post but more immediately relevant than an about page. It comes with the same fancy markdown editor and you can optionally appear in omg.lol’s <a href="https://now.garden/">Now Garden</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Statuslog</strong>: This is a place to post <a href="https://status.lol/">statuses</a>. It’s really just a fun, silly alternative to other social media platforms but without follows and likes and such. These can cross-post to Mastodon if you want.</li>
<li><strong>Weblog</strong>: A full-fledge blogging platform. I’m not aware of all its features but it’s pretty powerful. It comes with fancy markdown support and has all the bloggy things you need like tags and RSS. A good example of a very custom blog on omg.lol is <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/">Apple Annie’s Weblog</a>. But it’s worth noting you use it right out of the box without design customization if you want.</li>
<li><strong>Pastebin</strong>: It’s just a pastebin for storing text snippets. Super simple and friendly like all of the omg.lol services.</li>
<li><strong>Pics</strong>: It’s an image hosting service labeled as being “super-beta” as of the time of this writing. But it does what it says on the tin. You can host images there and they also show up on the <a href="https://some.pics/">some.pics</a> image feed.</li>
<li><strong>PURLs</strong>: Persistent uniform resource locators. This is a URL redirection service. You get <code>you.omg.lol/whatever</code> and <code>you.url.lol/whatever</code>. You can use these the way you would use similar services and they come with a basic hit counter and way to preview the URL before following it.</li>
<li><strong>Switchboard</strong>: This is a powerful routing system that lets you point the variants of your address wherever you want, be it a destination on the omg.lol platform or an external website. Most omg.lol services have their own domain so you end up with a variety of options. Just as an example, you get a tilde address (ie, <code>omg.lol/~you</code>). Mine points to my <a href="https://tilde.club/">tilde.club</a> <a href="https://omg.lol/~bw">webpage</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Keys</strong>: A place to store public keys—SSH, PGP, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Proofs</strong>: A service for verifying ownership or control of a particular web property at a particular moment in time. For example, here is <a href="https://proven.lol/f6874d">proof that I controlled blakewatson.com as of December 10, 2023</a>.</li>
<li><strong>API access</strong>: Most, if not all, omg.lol services have an API you can use to interact with them. Total nerd freedom. 🤯</li>
</ul>
<p>Phew, we made it! Thing is, omg.lol is constantly expanding and improving its offerings—this list will probably be outdated weeks or months after I publish it.</p>
<h2>A cool community</h2>
<p>I can’t explain it but when you join omg.lol you join a community of the nicest, most interesting people. This service just seems to bring the old-internet lovers together and, I don’t know, it’s just fun and pleasant.</p>
<p>If Mastodon is not your thing, that’s cool! There’s also an IRC with a bridge to Discord so you can chat with other members. I’m a lurker most of the time, but I will say that when I do participate in chat I feel immediately welcomed.</p>
<h2>Harnessing the power of the Adam</h2>
<p>The mastermind and architect behind omg.lol is <a href="https://adam.omg.lol/">Adam Newbold</a>. I can’t say enough nice things about him. Adam is extremely active in this community. I’ve seen him build entire features in an afternoon just because someone in chat said “it would be cool if…” Heck, I <em>was</em> that person in at least one instance.</p>
<p>Adam is just so good at listening to feedback and is always gracious about it, even if the answer is <em>no</em> or even if the person asking is being a little belligerent (not that this happens often). Adam’s positive energy is contagious. I think it spreads into the community and is a big reason that everyone seems so cool here.</p>
<p>Also can we talk about what a prolific creator he is? He’s always got tons of neat (<a href="https://neatnik.net/">-nik</a> 😄) stuff in the oven—<a href="https://terminal.land/">a multiplayer RPG in the shell</a>, <a href="https://web1.land/">a service dedicated to web 1</a>, and <a href="https://dns.kitchen/">a friendly DNS service</a>, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Okay, okay. Nerd crush over.</p>
<h2>The small web</h2>
<p>I’ve been enjoying a <a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/">different kind of internet</a> lately—the kind filled with <a href="https://personalsit.es/">personal</a> <a href="https://caramiki.com/">websites</a>, <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/">blogs</a> that aren’t cookie-cutter marketing machines, and <a href="https://satyrs.eu/index.html">hypertext oddities</a> you can only find by clicking around. And <a href="https://kayserifserif.place/work/proseplay/">so many</a> <a href="https://rknight.me/projects/">personal</a> <a href="https://neal.fun/">projects</a>.</p>
<p>This internet is a breath of fresh air if you’ve only been visiting what Google gives you on its first few pages of <del>results</del> ads. I, of course, <a href="https://blakewatson.com/journal/an-ode-to-web-pages/">think everyone should have a personal site</a>. And if you’re worried no one will want read your stuff, just remember that <a href="https://andy-bell.co.uk/just-post/">Andy will</a>.</p>
<p>Making your own website is rewarding in a way that a corporate social media profile never will be.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="left-col">

			<!--meta data end-->
			

						
<p>I have developed a way to supercharge ChatGPT. </p>



<div><p>It’s called Nova Mode 1.0, and it’s an awesome custom instruction that you can paste into your ChatGPT Custom instructions (see screenshot below) in ChatGPT Settings.</p><p>This modifies how ChatGPT works in all your chats, giving you much more control over how you interact with ChatGPT. </p></div>



<h2>What is Nova Mode For?</h2>



<p>Nova Mode (or //N) is for working in ChatGPT to iteratively edit and refine ideas more productively. </p>



<p>It is extremely useful if you use ChatGPT to generate, revise, and iterate on ideas and content — it makes your chat histories addressable, taggable, searchable and more.</p>



<p>First of all, it makes ChatGPT number every message so you can easily refer to it when speaking with ChatGPT. </p>



<p>Message numbering is helpful for editing and revising – for example you can ask ChatGPT to make a new version of a previous message or to combine several previous messages into a new message.</p>



<div><p>It provides a set of short commands prefixed by “//“ that cause ChatGPT to do a number of useful things like distilling the key points from a set of previous messages or expanding a message several times. </p><p>It also enables you to create your own commands to automate tasks inside ChatGPT, like expanding content or iterating some operation. </p></div>



<h2>Try it here as a GPT with more features! </h2>



<p><strong><a href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-tcXXGxXmA-nova-mode-ai-chat-authoring-productivity-tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">https://chat.openai.com/g/g-tcXXGxXmA-nova-mode-ai-chat-authoring-productivity-tool</a></strong></p>



<h2>Works Better in GPT 4</h2>



<p>Note that you will get better results if you use ChatGPT with the 4.0 model (you need ChatGPT Pro subscription for that). In ChatGPT free with the 3.5 model, results are inconsistent – sometimes it obeys the custom instructions and sometimes it doesn’t. If it isn’t working in 3.5 start a new chat and try again – but it’s better to use 4.0. </p>



<h2>How To Set Your Custom Instructions Settings</h2>



<ol>
<li>In the ChatGPT mobile app, click the 3 menu lines on upper left corner and then click on your profile icon on bottom left corner. Then click Custom Instructions.</li>



<li>In the Web version of ChatGPT, click your profile icon, then click Settings, then click on Custom Instructions.</li>



<li>Then copy and paste my Custom instructions (<strong>copy from the next section of this article below</strong>), into the bottom field of your Custom Instructions.</li>



<li>Click save</li>
</ol>

<h2>Copy this into lower field of your ChatGPT Custom Instructions </h2>



<h3>(<a href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-tcXXGxXmA-nova-mode-ai-chat-authoring-productivity-tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">or you can use the GPT Instead</a> with more features)</h3>



<p>————————————</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nova Mode = //N. Toggle //N = on. Msg = message, msgs = messages, cmd = command, USR = user, CPT = ChatGPT. All msgs have header as “Message#:” [msg#]; if replying to //[k] add subhead “In reply to: k.” First USR msg# = 1 and next CPT msg# = 2, etc., i.e. increment msg#’s by +1, alternating between USR and CPT. Response of n = option n in previous Msg, else = msgs n. //n = Msg n. // cmds can have params x y etc. //index: List Msgs (range, or all) + # + tags + gists. //distill: Extracts all unique points from msg set. //digest x: Summarizes x. //r n x = reply to //n with msg body x (e.g., “//r 4 foo”). //r x //k replies with result of //k. //t x y z tags Msg x with tags y and z.

</blockquote>



<h2>Next Steps</h2>



<div><p>After you paste it into your Custom Instructions, start typing messages in a new chat and you will see it start numbering them. You can now refer to messages in chats by number, and you can tag messages and apply prompts to ranges of messages. </p><p>But that’s just the beginning – it’s packed with prompt magic that will revolutionize how you interact with ChatGPT.</p><p><strong>Read the Manual: </strong></p></div>



<p>Type: </p>



<p><code>//?</code> </p>



<p>to get the full manual to learn what Nova Mode can do. </p>



<p><strong>Get Usage Examples </strong></p>



<p>Type:</p>



<p><code>//??</code></p>



<div><p><strong>Use //N Syntax</strong> to refer back to messages and operate on them in your ChatGPT Chats. </p><p>For example type: </p></div>



<div><p><code>continue from //8 </code></p><p>to make ChatGPT continue from where you left off in message 8. </p></div>



<p>Or type: </p>



<p><code>//distill 3-9 </code></p>



<p>to generate a new message that contains the essence of messages 3 through 9.</p>



<p>Or you can say:</p>



<p><code>Make a new draft of //11 that includes //distill 3-9</code></p>



<div><p>to use the points in 3-9 for a new draft of message 11.</p><p>Or type: </p></div>



<p><code>//t 5 good+draft</code></p>



<p>to tag message 5 with the tags good and draft. </p>



<p>Then type:</p>



<p><code>//digest //s good+draft</code></p>



<div><p>to generate a summary of all the messages tagged with good and draft.</p><p><strong>Try Meta Mode</strong>: Type:</p></div>



<p><code>//meta</code> </p>



<p>to customize how Nova Mode works. </p>



<h2>Advanced Usage (GPT 4 Only)</h2>



<p><strong>Try a Nested Loop:</strong> </p>



<div><p><code>//! (//! (hello world, 3)), 2)</code></p><p><strong>Define a function “voices”:</strong></p></div>



<p><code>//f voices x "Answer x with 3 additional //v voices (a) enthusiastic, (b) analytical, (c) critical and skeptical.</code></p>



<p>Now try: </p>



<p><code>//voices(How soon will we achieve AGI?)</code></p>



<p><strong>Define an iterating function “AGI”:</strong></p>



<div><p><code>//f “AGI” x “CPT will simulate an answer generated by an artificial general intelligence, in order to provide a very long response to x that is more intelligent, more expansive, more in-depth, more reasoned, more creative than what CPT would normally answer with. To accomplish this it will automatically iterate the AGI function on its own answer 2 times, critically evaluating itself and refining its answer each time, and finally it will produce an integrated answer that uses the insights from all the rounds.”</code></p><p>or equivalently:</p><p><code>//f AGI x (//! ("CPT will simulate an answer generated by an artificial general intelligence, in order to provide a very long response to x that is more intelligent, more expansive, more in-depth, more reasoned, more creative than what CPT would normally answer with. To accomplish this it will critically evaluate its own answer and refine its answer, and finally it will produce an integrated answer.", 2))</code></p></div>



<p>Then ask it: </p>



<p>/<code>/AGI(what is AGI?)</code></p>



<h2>Use Draft Function for Iterative Writing</h2>



<p>This function iteratively writes a new message using an outline or sections is a previous message as a guide. It’s useful for expanding an article from a shorter draft. </p>



<ol>
<li>Draft writes a new message from an outline in a previous message. Here is the definition: <br><code>//f draft x (Iteratively write doc outlined in //x, section by section. Flesh out each section in //v detail.)</code></li>



<li>To use it, just type: <br><code>//draft 4 </code><br>(where 4 is the message number that has the outline in it)</li>
</ol>



<div><p><strong>Footnotes</strong><br>– These instructions are exactly 1500 characters, which is the limit for a custom instruction. That took some work. 🙂<br>– These instructions work best in GPT 4.0 but they also sort of work in 3.5 after much tuning (results are inconsistent in 3.5). </p><p><strong>Have fun and please share this!</strong></p></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ayende.com/blog/198241-B/the-subtleties-of-proper-b-tree-implementation">https://ayende.com/blog/198241-B/the-subtleties-of-proper-b-tree-implementation</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38594139">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I mentioned earlier that <a href="https://ayende.com/blog/198209-C/reducing-complexity-with-a-shift-in-thinking?key=0bc5c1d0c15e4f709c2456abb13923d3">B+Trees are a gnarly beast</a> to implement properly. On the face of it, this is a really strange statement, because they are a pretty simple data structure. What is so complex about the implementation? You have a fixed size page, you add to it until it is full, then you split the page, and you are done. What’s the hassle?</p>
<p>Here is a simple scenario for page splits, the following page is completely full. We cannot fit another entry there:</p>
<p><a href="https://ayende.com/blog/Images/Open-Live-Writer/The-subtleties-of-proper-BTree-implement_FCA8/image_4.png"><img title="image" src="https://ayende.com/blog/Images/Open-Live-Writer/The-subtleties-of-proper-BTree-implement_FCA8/image_thumb_1.png" alt="image" width="155" height="183"></a></p>
<p>Now, if we try to add another item to the tree, we’ll need to split the page, and the result will be something like this (we add an entry with a key: <em>users/050</em>):</p>
<p><a href="https://ayende.com/blog/Images/Open-Live-Writer/The-subtleties-of-proper-BTree-implement_FCA8/image_6.png"><img title="image" src="https://ayende.com/blog/Images/Open-Live-Writer/The-subtleties-of-proper-BTree-implement_FCA8/image_thumb_2.png" alt="image" width="386" height="436"></a></p>
<p>How did we split the page? The code for that&nbsp; is really simple:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, since the data is sorted, we can simply take the last half of the entries from the source, copy them to the new page and call it a day. This is simple, effective, and will usually work just fine. The key word here is <em>usually</em>.</p>
<p>Given a B+Tree that uses variable size keys, with a page size of 4KB and a maximum size of 1 KB for the keys. On the face of it, this looks like a pretty good setup. If we split the page, we can be sure that we’ll have enough space to accommodate any valid key, right? Well, just as long as the data distribution makes sense. It often does not. Let’s talk about a concrete scenario, shall we? We store in the B+Tree a list of public keys.</p>
<p>This looks like the image below, where we have a single page with 16 entries and 3,938 bytes in use, and 158 bytes that are free. Take a look at the data for a moment, and you’ll notice some interesting patterns.</p>
<p><a href="https://ayende.com/blog/Images/Open-Live-Writer/The-subtleties-of-proper-BTree-implement_FCA8/image_12.png"><img title="image" src="https://ayende.com/blog/Images/Open-Live-Writer/The-subtleties-of-proper-BTree-implement_FCA8/image_thumb_5.png" alt="image" width="606" height="488"></a></p>
<p>The data is divided into two distinct types, EdDSA keys and RSA keys. Because they are prefixed with their type, all the EdDSA keys are first on the page, and the RSA keys are last. There is a <em>big</em> size difference between the two types of keys. And that turns out to be a real problem for us.</p>
<p>Consider what will happen when we want to insert a new key to this page. We still have room to a few more EdDSA keys, so that isn’t really that interesting, but what happens when we want to insert a new RSA key? There is not enough room here, so we split the page. Using the algorithm above, we get the following tree structure post split:</p>
<p><a href="https://ayende.com/blog/Images/Open-Live-Writer/The-subtleties-of-proper-BTree-implement_FCA8/image_14.png"><img title="image" src="https://ayende.com/blog/Images/Open-Live-Writer/The-subtleties-of-proper-BTree-implement_FCA8/image_thumb_6.png" alt="image" width="845" height="574"></a></p>
<p>Remember, we need to add an RSA key, so we are now going to go to the bottom right page and try to add the value. But there is <em>not enough room</em> to add a bit more than 512 bytes to the page, is there?</p>
<p>What happens next depends on the exact implementation. It is possible that you’ll get an error, or another split, or the tree will attempt to proceed and do something completely bizarre.</p>
<p>The key here (pun intended) is that even though the situation looks relatively&nbsp;simple, a perfectly reasonable choice can hide a pretty subtle bug for a very long time. It is only when you hit the <em>exact</em> problematic circumstances that you’ll run into problems.</p>
<p>This has been a fairly simple problem, but there are many such edge cases that may be hiding in the weeds of B+Tree implementations. that is one of the reasons that working with production data is such a big issue. Real world data is <em>messy</em>, it has unpredictable patterns and stuff that you’ll likely never think of. It is also the best way I have found to smoke out those details.</p>

<pre>Hi,
As some of you might know, JEP 454 has landed in the JDK repository and 
the FFM API is no longer a preview API :-)

A binary snapshot containing the Java 22 changes is available here:

<a href="https://jdk.java.net/22/">https://jdk.java.net/22/</a>

And, a jextract branch to go with it is also available here:

<a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jextract/tree/jdk22">https://github.com/openjdk/jextract/tree/jdk22</a>

Over the last few months the focus has been on further polishing the 
rough edges of the API. We have just published a PR [1] which enhances 
the "critical" linker option so that heap segments can be passed 
directly to native code (w/o copy). We believe this further enhancement 
should bring some benefits for legacy APIs that are "stuck" dealing with 
byte arrays, but need to interop with native code.

We have also been working on the tooling aspect of restricted methods, 
adding support for restricted method warnings in javac [2] and also 
adding better javadoc support for restricted methods [3].

It is also nice to see the first attempts at using FFM within the JDK 
itself [4], we hope this trend is one that will continue.

Of course, finalizing the API doesn't mean we're done (is there ever 
such a thing?). We are actively exploring ways to model foreign data 
with records, and we plan to make more progress on improving the startup 
of FFM clients. More longer term, there's a lot of interesting synergies 
to look forward to, from structured arenas (Loom) to better support for 
unsigned types (Valhalla). Plenty of exciting stuff to work on still!

We'd also like to take a moment to thank all of you. It is a privilege 
to be in a position to improve the Java platform, and one that we do not 
take lightly. But, without your help, all our efforts will be in vain. 
So we're very grateful for the feedback you have provided along the way, 
in every shape or form, be it a bug report, a benchmark or even just a 
"git checkout" to see what's up. You are the pulsating heart of what we 
call Java. Please keep it up, and keep helping us making Java a better 
language/platform.

Cheers
Maurizio

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ratatui</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://ratatui.rs/" rel="nofollow">Ratatui</a> is a crate for cooking up terminal user interfaces in Rust. It is a lightweight
library that provides a set of widgets and utilities to build complex Rust TUIs. Ratatui was
forked from the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tui" rel="nofollow">tui-rs</a> crate in 2023 in order to continue its development.</p>

<p dir="auto">Add <code>ratatui</code> and <code>crossterm</code> as dependencies to your cargo.toml:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cargo add ratatui crossterm"><pre>cargo add ratatui crossterm</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Ratatui uses <a href="https://crates.io/crates/crossterm" rel="nofollow">Crossterm</a> by default as it works on most platforms. See the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/installation/" rel="nofollow">Installation</a>
section of the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/" rel="nofollow">Ratatui Website</a> for more details on how to use other backends (<a href="https://crates.io/crates/termion" rel="nofollow">Termion</a> /
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/termwiz" rel="nofollow">Termwiz</a>).</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2>
<p dir="auto">Ratatui is based on the principle of immediate rendering with intermediate buffers. This means
that for each frame, your app must render all widgets that are supposed to be part of the UI.
This is in contrast to the retained mode style of rendering where widgets are updated and then
automatically redrawn on the next frame. See the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/concepts/rendering/" rel="nofollow">Rendering</a> section of the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/" rel="nofollow">Ratatui Website</a> for
more info.</p>

<p dir="auto">The following example demonstrates the minimal amount of code necessary to setup a terminal and
render "Hello World!". The full code for this example which contains a little more detail is in
<a href="https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/blob/main/examples/hello_world.rs">hello_world.rs</a>. For more guidance on different ways to structure your application see the

<p dir="auto">Every application built with <code>ratatui</code> needs to implement the following steps:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Initialize the terminal</li>
<li>A main loop to:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Handle input events</li>
<li>Draw the UI</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Restore the terminal state</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The library contains a [<code>prelude</code>] module that re-exports the most commonly used traits and
types for convenience. Most examples in the documentation will use this instead of showing the
full path of each type.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Initialize and restore the terminal</h3>
<p dir="auto">The [<code>Terminal</code>] type is the main entry point for any Ratatui application. It is a light
abstraction over a choice of <code>Backend</code> implementations that provides functionality to draw
each frame, clear the screen, hide the cursor, etc. It is parametrized over any type that
implements the <code>Backend</code> trait which has implementations for <a href="https://crates.io/crates/crossterm" rel="nofollow">Crossterm</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/termion" rel="nofollow">Termion</a> and
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/termwiz" rel="nofollow">Termwiz</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Most applications should enter the Alternate Screen when starting and leave it when exiting and
also enable raw mode to disable line buffering and enable reading key events. See the <a href="https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/blob/main/backend"><code>backend</code>
module</a> and the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/concepts/backends/" rel="nofollow">Backends</a> section of the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/" rel="nofollow">Ratatui Website</a> for more info.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Drawing the UI</h3>
<p dir="auto">The drawing logic is delegated to a closure that takes a <code>Frame</code> instance as argument. The
<code>Frame</code> provides the size of the area to draw to and allows the app to render any <code>Widget</code>
using the provided <code>render_widget</code> method. See the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/how-to/widgets/" rel="nofollow">Widgets</a> section of the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/" rel="nofollow">Ratatui Website</a> for
more info.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Handling events</h3>
<p dir="auto">Ratatui does not include any input handling. Instead event handling can be implemented by
calling backend library methods directly. See the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/concepts/event-handling/" rel="nofollow">Handling Events</a> section of the <a href="https://ratatui.rs/" rel="nofollow">Ratatui
Website</a> for more info. For example, if you are using <a href="https://crates.io/crates/crossterm" rel="nofollow">Crossterm</a>, you can use the
<a href="https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/event/index.html" rel="nofollow"><code>crossterm::event</code></a> module to handle events.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <code>Text</code>, <code>Line</code> and <code>Span</code> types are the building blocks of the library and are used in

<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/blob/main/style"><code>style</code> module</a> provides types that represent the various styling options. The most

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="article-body">
<p><span>Imagine setting aside a wheel </span>of cheese at your wedding. What would it look like if it were served at your funeral?</p>
<p>If you were lucky, it would look like one of the wheels in Jean-Jacques Zufferey’s basement in Grimentz, Switzerland: shriveled and brown, pockmarked from decades of mite and mouse nibbles, and hard as a rock. You’d need an axe to slice it open and strong booze to wash it down. This is the rare cheese you don’t want to cut into when it’s aged to perfection. A fossilized funeral cheese means you lived a long life.</p>
<p>Zufferey’s home, high in the Swiss mountains of Val d’Anniviers, is one of the last places you’ll find evidence of this peculiar practice—of keeping a wheel of cheese to be eaten at your funeral.</p>
<figure><img src="https://img.atlasobscura.com/r1-iaD1cVsD4MV_gdJrfIRzU6oXCh-S4yRGHpAmy04Y/rs:fill:12000:12000/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL2Fzc2V0/cy82N2I2OGM4YWEx/MTU3NDFkNTNfXzc3/QTQ1NzkuanBn.jpg" alt="Jean-Jacques Zufferey holds a wheel of 149-year-old cheese." width="auto" data-kind="article-image" id="article-image-69320" data-src="https://img.atlasobscura.com/r1-iaD1cVsD4MV_gdJrfIRzU6oXCh-S4yRGHpAmy04Y/rs:fill:12000:12000/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL2Fzc2V0/cy82N2I2OGM4YWEx/MTU3NDFkNTNfXzc3/QTQ1NzkuanBn.jpg"><figcaption>Jean-Jacques Zufferey holds a wheel of 149-year-old cheese. <span>Molly McDonough</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Val d’Anniviers, which snakes up the highest peaks of the Swiss Alps, is a case study in how mountains isolate valleys and villages, breeding unique traditions. When Swiss anthropologist Yvonne Preiswerk first arrived to conduct fieldwork here, she noted strange funeral rituals reminiscent of ancient Egypt.</p>
<p>“We are struck by … a special kind of mountain Catholicism,” she wrote in the 1992 paper “Death, the Priest, the Woman and the Cow: Chronicle of Research in the Village.” In centuries previous, she explained, visitors appalled by these pagan practices had labeled the locals “barbaric,” positing that they’d descended from the Huns.</p>
<p>The rituals that shocked them involved a mix of death and cheese. It seems an unlikely pairing, but the landscape offers an explanation. Along the valley’s winding road to the small mountain village of Grimentz, isolated villages cling to the cliffs in the shadows of craggy, glaciated peaks. The ground is rocky and steep. Growing seasons are short and winters are long. To survive the cold, villagers had to preserve nutrient-dense food.</p>

<p>That’s why residents of Grimentz, like people elsewhere in the Alps, breed bovines adapted to the steep landscape, bringing them to high pasture in summer to graze. Pooling abundant summer milk, they make giant wheels of cheese.</p>
<p>To render the wheels sturdy, cheesemakers “cook” the curds to firm them, and press them to expel as much whey as possible. Moisture and heat cause spoilage, speeding up a cheese’s aging process; in the dry, cold mountain air, these cheeses age slowly. While aging can continue for years, most Alpine wheels tend to reach peak ripeness—still pliable, but with plenty of flavor—months later, during the worst of winter when, historically, little else was available. Sliced onto rye bread or melted fireside, cheese ensured a calorie source in winter.</p>
<p>Devotion to dairy has taken different forms throughout the Alps’s secluded valleys. “A popular culture of the cow … traverses all moments, objects, and events of the mountain peasant,” wrote Preiswerk. In Grimentz, it manifested in elaborate funerals. After a death, the bells of the deceased’s cows were removed, so that the animals, too, could mourn. Families added a “picnic of the dead” to the casket, which included a bottle of wine, bread, and cheese (as well as sturdy boots, as ghosts were rumored to wander the glaciers after dark).</p>
<figure><img src="https://img.atlasobscura.com/rrbwbGj6BhRB6xS0Zc3VNPG2mbupp_7UXAFHpJ1hPNw/rt:fill/w:1200/el:1/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL2Fzc2V0/cy8wM2YxNmRkMy01/ODg4LTRkYzItOTEw/My02MDBlMDQyMmZj/ZWNkYTkxODY3NGVj/ODNhMjBkOWJfR2V0/dHlJbWFnZXMtMTM1/ODI4NjYwX2EuanBn.jpg" alt="A cemetery in the village of Grimentz." width="auto" data-kind="article-image" id="article-image-80796" data-src="https://img.atlasobscura.com/rrbwbGj6BhRB6xS0Zc3VNPG2mbupp_7UXAFHpJ1hPNw/rt:fill/w:1200/el:1/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL2Fzc2V0/cy8wM2YxNmRkMy01/ODg4LTRkYzItOTEw/My02MDBlMDQyMmZj/ZWNkYTkxODY3NGVj/ODNhMjBkOWJfR2V0/dHlJbWFnZXMtMTM1/ODI4NjYwX2EuanBn.jpg"><figcaption>A cemetery in the village of Grimentz. <span>Buena Vista Images/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The same foods comprised the all-important burial meal, which symbolized the reconstitution of the community after its tragic rift. As one of Preiswerk’s interview subjects recounted, the funeral guests were told, “Come to the meal, because the dead man has left enough.”</p>
<p>In a historically poor area, “leaving enough” required advance planning. “There was the ‘cheese of the dead,’” explains Zufferey. “Everyone had a wheel of cheese so that they had something to serve at their funeral.” When the inevitable time came, the chiseled cheese was washed down with <em>vin des glaciers, </em>the local wine.</p>
<p>As the Valaisan Alps modernized during the 1900s, and villages moved away from subsistence economies, fears of cheeseless funeral tables waned. According to anthropologist Claude-Alexandre Fournier, families gradually stopped overseeing funeral rituals at home. “Mortuary knowledge was no longer transmitted,” he wrote in the 2013 ethnography <em>Odette Fournier, Sage-Femme</em>, “thus depriving families of the ‘death equipment box.’” Yet in a few basements scattered throughout the valley, you’ll still find carefully stacked wheels of funeral cheese.</p>

Since they’re completely firm, they won’t lose their shape. <span>Molly McDonough</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In Grimentz, Zufferey, a tall, soft-spoken man with tiny glasses and a day job at the local department of agriculture, unlocks his basement door, releasing an ammoniated, musty smell. His family, too, had forgotten about their funeral cheeses, until his grandmother died in 1944. That’s when Zufferey’s father found two very old wheels in her basement.</p>
<p>Instead of eating the cheeses, whose engravings suggest a production year of 1870, Zufferey’s father decided to preserve them. In the years since, the family has added wheels from time to time, building a collection. Rather than prepping for a funeral, they’re dutifully preserving evidence of a waning tradition—and what might be some of the world’s oldest wheels of cheese.</p>
<p>Zufferey picks one of the wheels, which is now 149 years old, from the shelf. “You can touch it—like a relic in the church,’” he quips. Rock hard and leathery, with a glossy brown surface reminiscent of a bog body, it’s still a bit oily, but sapped of moisture. Its own microbes and molds are likely long deceased. He picks up another, from 1967, engraved with edelweiss flowers. A third, from 1992, depicts a “queen cow.”</p>

<p>Perhaps pondering his own mortality, Zufferey worries about what will happen to his collection in the long term. He’d like to give them to a museum, but can’t find anywhere nearby with proper climate control. “There is no museum of cheese in the Valais,” he says. “It’s bizarre.”</p>
<p>There’s no rush, though. His cool <em>cave </em>cut into the mountainside beneath his family’s wooden chalet seems to be working for these wheels. Zufferey gingerly places them back into their horizontal compartments, ducks out of the tiny basement back into the cobbled village square, and locks the door. Casting darkness on the uneaten death cheeses, he leaves them to await their own fate.</p>

<p>Romero announced on December 8, 2022, that he would stream the building of a SIGIL II level on December 10, 2022—Doom's 29th release anniversary—at 5:00 PM Eastern time on Twitch.<sup id="cite_ref-dec8tweet_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-dec8tweet-6">[6]</a></sup> He also noted at this time that the episode will again consist of nine levels, and that it will be for Doom rather than Doom II (earlier use of the term <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Megawad" title="Megawad">megawad</a> made this somewhat unclear).
</p><p>A previously released level, "<a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/One_Humanity" title="One Humanity">One Humanity</a>," was released as a standalone WAD for charity on March 2, 2022. However that level was for Doom II, and Romero has since reassigned it to the "Hellion" project for Doom II.<sup id="cite_ref-pagbtweet_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-pagbtweet-7">[7]</a></sup>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://theconversation.com/inert-ingredients-in-pesticides-may-be-more-toxic-to-bees-than-scientists-thought-218005">https://theconversation.com/inert-ingredients-in-pesticides-may-be-more-toxic-to-bees-than-scientists-thought-218005</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38593008">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Bees help pollinate over a third of the world’s crops, contributing <a href="https://www.ipbes.net/article/press-release-pollinators-vital-our-food-supply-under-threat">an estimated US$235 billion to $577 billion</a> in value to global agriculture. They also face a myriad of stresses, including pathogens and parasites, loss of suitable food sources and habitat, <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-air-pollution-is-making-life-tougher-for-bugs-213122">air pollution</a> and <a href="https://theconversation.com/bees-face-many-challenges-and-climate-change-is-ratcheting-up-the-pressure-190296">climate-driven weather extremes</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-46948-6">recent study</a> has identified another important but understudied pressure on bees: “inert” ingredients in pesticides. </p>

<p>All pesticide products in the U.S. contain <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/basic-information-about-pesticide-ingredients">active and inert ingredients</a>. Active ingredients are designed to kill or control a specific insect, weed or fungus and are listed on product labels. All other ingredients – emulsifiers, solvents, carriers, aerosol propellants, fragrances, dyes and such – are considered inert.</p>

<p>The new study exposed honeybees to two treatments: the isolated active ingredients in the fungicide <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/ppls/007969-00199-20221130.pdf">Pristine</a>, which is used to control <a href="https://agriculture.basf.us/content/dam/cxm/agriculture/crop-protection/products/documents/BASF_Pristine_Almonds_TIB_medres.pdf">fungal diseases in almonds</a> and <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/ppls/007969-00199-20221130.pdf">other crops</a>, and the whole Pristine formulation, including inert ingredients. The results were quite surprising: The whole formulation impaired honeybees’ memory, while the active ingredients alone did not. </p>

<p>This suggests that the inert ingredients in the formula were actually what made Pristine toxic to bees – either because the inerts were toxic on their own or because combining them with the active ingredients made the active ingredients more toxic. As a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B1qAtjIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">social scientist focusing on bee declines</a>, I believe that either way, these findings have important implications for pesticide regulation and bee health. </p>

<h2>What are inert ingredients?</h2>

<p>Inert ingredients have a variety of functions. They may extend a pesticide’s shelf life, reduce risks for people who apply the pesticides or help a pesticide work better. Some inerts, called adjuvants, help pesticides stick to plant surfaces, reduce pesticide drift or help active ingredients better penetrate a plant’s surface. </p>

<p>The “inert” label is a colloquial misnomer, though. As <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/basic-information-about-pesticide-ingredients">the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency notes</a>, inerts aren’t necessarily inactive or even nontoxic. In fact, pesticide users <a href="https://doi.org/10.1289%2Fehp.118-a168">sometimes know very little</a> about how inerts function in a pesticide formula. That’s partly because they are regulated very differently than active ingredients. </p>

<h2>Measuring bee effects</h2>

<p>Under the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-federal-insecticide-fungicide-and-rodenticide-act">Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act</a>, or FIFRA, the EPA oversees pesticide regulation in the U.S. To register a pesticide product for outdoor use, chemical companies must provide <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-07/documents/guidance-exposure-effects-testing-assessing-risks-bees.pdf">reliable risk assessment data</a> on the active ingredients’ toxicity for bees, including the results of an acute honeybee contact test. </p>

<p>The acute contact test tracks how honeybees react to a pesticide application over a short period of time. It also aims to establish the dose of a pesticide that will kill 50% of a group of honeybees, a value known as the LD50. To determine the LD50, scientists apply the pesticide to bees’ midsections and then observe the bees for 48 to 96 hours for signs of poisoning. </p>



<p>In 2016, the EPA <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-07/documents/guidance-exposure-effects-testing-assessing-risks-bees.pdf">expanded its data requirements</a> by requiring an acute honeybee oral toxicity test, in which adult bees are fed a chemical, as well as a 21-day honeybee larval test that tracks larval reaction to an agrochemical from the egg to their emergence as adult bees. </p>

<p>These tests all help the agency determine what potential risk an active ingredient may pose for honeybees, along with other data. Based on the information from these varied tests, pesticides are labeled as nontoxic, moderately toxic or highly toxic. </p>

<h2>A chemical black box</h2>

<p>Despite this rigorous testing, much remains unknown about how safe pesticides are for bees. This is particularly true for pesticides that have sublethal or chronic toxicities – in other words, pesticides that don’t cause immediate death or obvious signs of poisoning but have other significant effects.</p>

<p>This lack of knowledge about sublethal and chronic effects is problematic, because bees can be repeatedly exposed over long time spans to pesticides on floral nectar or pollen, or to pesticide contamination that builds up <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0009754">in beehives</a>. They even may be exposed <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/aesa/saaa041">through miticides</a> that beekeepers use to control Varroa mites, a <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/pacific-west-area/tucson-az/carl-hayden-bee-research-center/research/varroa/varroa-overview/">devastating bee parasite</a>.</p>

<p>Complicating the issue, symptoms of sublethal exposure are often more subtle or take longer to become apparent than acute or lethal toxicity. <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5772/62487">Symptoms might include</a> abnormal foraging and learning ability, decreased egg laying by the queen, wing deformation, stunted growth or decreased colony survival. The EPA doesn’t always require chemical companies to perform the tests that could detect these symptoms.</p>

<p>Inert ingredients add another level of mystery. While the EPA reviews and <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/basic-information-about-pesticide-ingredients">must approve all inert ingredients</a>, it does not require the same toxicity testing as for active ingredients. </p>

<p>This is because under FIFRA, inert ingredients are protected as trade secrets, or <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/basic-information-about-pesticide-ingredients">confidential business information</a>. Only the total percentage of inert ingredients is required on the label, often lumped together and described as “other ingredients.”</p>

<h2>Sublethal weapons</h2>

<p>A growing body of evidence suggests that inerts are not as harmless as the name suggests. For example, exposure to two types of adjuvants – organosilicone and nonionic surfactants – can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0040848">impair honeybees’ learning performance</a>. Bees rely on learning and memory functions to gather food and return to the hive, so losing these crucial skills can endanger a colony’s survival. </p>

<p>Inerts can also affect bumblebees. In a 2021 study, exposure to alcohol ethoxylates, a coformulant in the fungicide Amistar, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-00919-x">killed 30% of the bees exposed to it</a> and caused a number of sublethal effects.</p>

<p>While some inerts may be nontoxic on their own, it’s hard to predict what will happen when they are combined with active ingredients. Research has shown that when two or more agrochemicals are combined, they can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03787-7">become more toxic for bees</a> than when applied on their own. This is known as <a href="https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/synergism.html">synergistic toxicity</a>. </p>

<p>Synergism can also occur when inerts are combined with pesticides. Another 2021 study showed that adjuvants that were nontoxic on their own caused <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s41348-021-00541-z">increased colony mortality when combined with insecticides</a>. </p>

<h2>A better testing strategy</h2>

<p>Mounting evidence on the toxicity of inerts points to three key changes that could better support bee health and minimize bees’ exposure to potential stressors. </p>

<p>First, environmental risk assessments for pesticides could test the whole pesticide formulation, including inert ingredients, to provide a more complete picture of a pesticide’s toxicity to bees. This is already done <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pollinator-protection/pollinator-risk-assessment-guidance">in some cases</a> but could be required for all outdoor uses where bees are at risk of exposure.</p>

<p>Second, inerts could be identified on product labels to enable independent research and risk assessment. </p>

<p>Third, more testing could be required on pesticides’ long-term sublethal effects on bees, such as learning impairment. Such research would be especially relevant for pesticides that are applied to blooming crops or flowers that attract bees.</p>

<p>Researchers and environmental groups have been arguing for changes like these since <a href="https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.9374">at least 2006</a>. However, because pesticide regulation is dictated by federal law, changes require congressional action. This would be challenging politically, since it would increase the regulatory burden on the chemical industry. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, rising concerns about <a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-ento-011118-111847">bumblebee declines</a> and beekeepers’ significant <a href="https://beeinformed.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BIP-2022-23-Loss-Abstract.pdf">annual colony losses</a> make a strong case for a more precautionary approach to pesticide regulation. With a growing world population and <a href="https://theconversation.com/cop28-7-food-and-agriculture-innovations-needed-to-protect-the-climate-and-feed-a-rapidly-growing-world-218414">food supplies under increasing stress</a>, supporting bees’ contribution to agriculture is more important then ever.</p>

    <p>Buried beneath the oceans surrounding continents is a naturally occurring frozen form of methane and water. Sometimes dubbed “fire-ice” as you can literally set light to it, marine methane hydrate can melt as the climate warms, uncontrollably releasing methane – a potent greenhouse gas – into the ocean and possibly the atmosphere. </p>

<p>Colleagues and I have just published <a href="https://rdcu.be/dsTTt">research</a> showing more of this methane hydrate is vulnerable to warming than previously thought. This is a worry as that hydrate contains about as much carbon as all of the remaining oil and gas on Earth. </p>

<p>Releasing it from the seabed could cause the oceans to become more acidic and the climate to warm further. This is a dangerous set of circumstances. </p>

<p>The massive venting of methane from similar ancient marine hydrate reservoirs has been linked to some of the severest and most rapid climate changes in the Earth’s history. There is even evidence that the process has started again near the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11528">east coast of the US</a>. </p>

<p>I have worked on hydrates for over a decade, mainly looking at the methane hydrate offshore of Mauritania, West Africa. Recently I have taken 3D seismic data intended to reveal oil and gas and repurposed it to map out the hydrates under the ocean floor. Ultimately, I wanted to work out if climate change is causing methane to bubble to the surface. </p>

<p>3D seismic is the geologist’s equivalent of the doctor’s CT scan. It can cover hundreds of square kilometres, and can reveal hydrates a few kilometres below the seabed. Hydrate is easily identified in these giant surveys because the sound waves created by a source of seismic energy towed by a ship reflect off the bottom of the hydrate layers.  </p>

<h2>Looking for methane using 3D seismic imagery</h2>

<p>As I settled into a new way of life during the first COVID lockdown in early 2020, I reopened the much-studied dataset and started mapping again. I knew there were many examples of hydrate that had thawed as a result of warming since the last glacial period peaked some 20,000 years ago, and I knew we could detect this on the 3D datasets. </p>

<p>But what was the fate of the methane? Did it reach the oceans and atmosphere? Because if it did, this is a major clue that it could happen again.</p>

<p>Around continents, where the oceans are relatively shallow, hydrate is only just cold enough to remain frozen. So it is very vulnerable to any warming, and that is why these areas have been the focus of most scientific investigations. </p>

<p>The good news is that only 3.5% of the world’s hydrate resides in the vulnerable zone, in this precarious state. Most hydrate is instead deemed to be “safe”, buried hundreds of metres below the seabed in deeper waters tens of kilometres further from land.</p>

<p>But frozen methane in the deep ocean may vulnerable after all. In oceans and seas where the water is deeper than around 450 metres to 700 metres are layer upon layer of sediment that contains the hydrate. And some of it is deeply buried and warmed geothermally by the Earth so, despite being hundreds of metres below the seafloor, it is right at the point of instability. </p>

<p>Some layers of sediment are permeable and create a complex underground plumbing for the gas to move through if it’s liberated during climatic warming. Just like holding a football underwater methane gas wants to push upwards because of its buoyancy and burst through the 100s of metres of sediment layers. </p>

<p>Imposed upon this complex geology has been the seven glacials (or ice ages) and interglacials, which warmed and cooled the system repeatedly over the last million years.</p>

<h2>Methane is migrating</h2>

<p>During this first lockdown of 2020 I found spectacular evidence that during warm periods during the last million or so years methane migrated laterally, upwards and landwards toward Africa and leaked in much shallower water. Beneath a layer of up to 80 metres of sediment are 23 giant craters on the ancient seabed, each one kilometre wide and up to 50 metres deep, big enough to be filled with multiple Wembley stadiums. </p>

<p>The seismic imaging provides the tell tale signs of methane immediately below the craters. And similar craters elsewhere form due to prolonged or explosive release of gas at the seabed. </p>

<p>These craters are not located in the vulnerable zone where all the attention has been – they are landward of it at about 330 metres water depth. With the discovery in hand, I gathered an international team of scientists (modellers, physicists, geoscientists) to work out what caused the formation of these remarkable things and when they formed. Our results are now published in <a href="https://rdcu.be/dsTTt">Nature Geoscience</a>.</p>

<p>We believe they formed as a result of repeated warming periods. These periods impacted hydrate in the deep ocean and the released methane migrated up to 40km towards the continent, to be vented beyond the shallowest hydrate deposits. So during a warming world the volume of hydrate that will be vulnerable to leaking methane is more significant than previously thought. </p>

<p>The positive outlook is that there are many natural barriers to this methane. But be warned, we expect that in some places on earth, as we warm the planet, methane from the deep will escape into our oceans.</p>

<p><em>This article was produced in collaboration&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.courtwatch.news/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=substack_profile" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><u>with Court Watch</u></em></a><em>, an independent outlet that unearths overlooked court records.</em></p><p>The U.S. government is demanding that tech companies provide information related to push notifications in order to identify a target’s specific device, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24192651-push-notification-search-warrant-application?ref=404media.co"><u>according to a court record</u></a> reviewed by 404 Media. The finding comes as Senator Ron Wyden published a letter on Wednesday warning that the U.S. and foreign governments are making such surveillance demands around push notifications to Apple and Google.&nbsp;</p><p>It is not totally clear if the demand for data related to push notifications mentioned in the court record is one and the same as that described at a high level in Wyden’s letter. Regardless, the court record provides more clarity on the legal mechanisms being used in at least some cases to request information related to push notifications, and what sort of crimes this novel surveillance technique is being used against.&nbsp;</p><p>“In the spring of 2022, my office received a tip that government agencies in foreign countries were demanding smartphone ‘push’ notification records from Google and Apple. My staff have been investigating this tip for the past year, which included contacting Apple and Google,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24191267-wyden_smartphone_push_notification_surveillance_letter_to_doj_-_signed?ref=404media.co"><u>the letter</u></a> from Senator Wyden to Attorney General Merrick B. Garland reads. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/governments-spying-apple-google-users-through-push-notifications-us-senator-2023-12-06/?ref=404media.co"><u>Reuters was first to report</u></a> the letter.</p><div><p>📱</p><p><b><strong>Do you know anything else about push notification surveillance? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at +44 20 8133 5190. Otherwise, send me an email at joseph@404media.co.</strong></b></p></div><p>As the letter explains, push notifications are not sent directly from an app provider to a user’s smartphone. Instead, “they pass through a kind of digital post office run by the phone’s operating system provider,” typically meaning Apple or Google.&nbsp;</p><p>When a user gets a push notification on their phone, Apple or Google receive a lot of information, including metadata that shows which app received a notification, and which phone and associated Google or Apple account it was to be sent to, Wyden says in his letter. In some cases, unencrypted content like the actual text displayed in the notification may be included too, Wyden adds.</p><p>The letter does not disclose the legal mechanism used by governments to demand this data from Apple or Google. But the court record reviewed by 404 Media does include some specifics around push notification demands. <a href="https://www.courtwatch.news/?ref=404media.co"><u>Court Watch</u></a> shared the record with 404 Media. The record is a search warrant application from May 2020 related to the investigation of a person suspected of theft or bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>In the search warrant application for information associated with a specific Yahoo email account, an FBI Special Agent writes under a section of the record entitled “Background Information Regarding Provider Services” that when a user of a mobile app installs and launches an app, the app will direct the device to obtain a “Push Token.” This is “a unique identifier that allows the provider associated with the application [...] to locate the device on which the application is installed.”</p><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/push-notifications-1.png" width="1064" height="538" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/push-notifications-1.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/push-notifications-1.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/push-notifications-1.png 1064w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/push-notifications-2.png" width="1040" height="422" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/push-notifications-2.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/push-notifications-2.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/12/push-notifications-2.png 1040w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span>Screenshots from the search warrant application.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>The court record then points specifically to Apple and Google, adding “After the applicable push notification (e.g., Apple Push Notifications (APN) or Google Cloud Messaging) sends a Push Token to the device, the Token is then sent to the application, which in turn sends the Push Token to the application’s server/provider.” When a company then sends push notifications, it sends both the token itself and what the court record describes as the “payload” associated with the notification, “the substance of what needs to be sent by the application to the device.”</p><p>The Special Agent adds that these Push Tokens are stored on the relevant tech company’s servers, and that these may help identify a specific phone or computer used by the target. Or, as the Special Agent puts it, “Accordingly, the computers of PROVIDER are likely to contain useful information that may help to identify the specific device(s) used by a particular subscriber to access the subscriber’s PROVIDER account via the mobile application.”</p><p>It is not clear if this is boilerplate language that has been included in the search warrant application or whether the agent was specifically seeking this information from Yahoo.</p><p>As Wyden’s letter continues, “as with all of the other information these companies store for or about their users, because Apple and Google deliver push notification data, they can be secretly compelled by governments to hand over this information.”</p><p>Wyden concludes the letter by saying that Apple and Google should be permitted to “generally reveal whether they have been compelled to facilitate this surveillance practice,” and to publish aggregate data on the number of demands they have received. When Reuters contacted Apple for comment, the company told the outlet that Wyden’s letter gave them the opening needed to share more details about how governments monitor push notifications.</p><p>“In this case, the federal government prohibited us from sharing any information,” Apple told Reuters in a statement. “Now that this method has become public we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these kinds of requests.” Reuters cited a source familiar with the matter who described the foreign governments involved in making the requests as democracies allied to the U.S. government.</p><p>Apple did not immediately respond to 404 Media’s request for comment on the legal mechanisms used against push notification-related data. A Google spokesperson told 404 Media in an emailed statement that “We were the first major company to publish a public transparency report sharing the number and types of government requests for user data we receive, including the requests referred to by Senator Wyden. We share the Senator’s commitment to keeping users informed about these requests.”</p>

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>The full section of the court record discussing push notifications is included below.</p><blockquote><em>PROVIDER also allows its subscribers to access its various services through an application that can be installed on and accessed via cellular telephones and other mobile devices. This application is associated with the subscriber’s PROVIDER account. In my training and experience, I have learned that when the user of a mobile application installs and launches the application on a device (such as a cellular telephone), the application directs the device in question to obtain a Push Token, a unique identifier that allows the provider associated with the application (such as PROVIDER) to locate the device on which the application is installed. After the applicable push notification (e.g., Apple Push Notifications (APN) or Google Cloud Messaging) sends a Push Token to the device, the Token is then sent to the application, which in turn sends the Push Token to the application’s server/provider. Thereafter, whenever the provider needs to send notifications to the user’s device, it sends both the Push Token and the payload associated with the notification (i.e., the substance of what needs to be sent by the application to the device). To ensure this process works, Push Tokens associated with a subscriber’s account are stored on the provider’s server(s). Accordingly, the computers of PROVIDER are likely to contain useful information that may help to identify the specific device(s) used by a particular subscriber to access the subscriber’s PROVIDER account via the mobile application.</em></blockquote>

<p role="doc-subtitle">Troubles registered in Emacs 30</p>
</header><p>Created on <span><span>[2023-12-10]</span></span>, last updated <span><span>[2023-12-10]</span></span></p>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> the following contains several hyperboles that reflect my
emotions, and should probably be taken with a grain of salt, or not at
all. While I am intentionally expressing criticism, I most sincerely
hope not to offend anyone.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://eshelyaron.com/notes/emacs.html" title="Notes about Emacs (this free software text OS thingy here)">Emacs</a> master branch is broken—for good, it seems. Emacs
maintainers accepted a heavy-handed, harmful change, disregarding
concerns voiced by multiple users and developers. I’ve created a
fixed, and improved, Emacs fork. I’ll be using and developing this
fork, and you’re welcome to join.
</p>
<p>
Let’s take a step back. What is the Emacs master branch? That’s
essentially the development version of Emacs, and what will soon
become Emacs version 30. Many Emacs hackers and enthusiasts track the
master branch to enjoy all of the latest developments and
improvements. Thanks to the tireless work of the Emacs maintainers in
scrutinizing incoming patches, the Emacs master branch has been very
stable in recent years. But a few weeks ago, Emacs master users got a
very unpleasant surprise.
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>commit 589e6ae1fb983bfba42f20906773555037246e45</span>
<span>Author: Thierry Volpiatto</span>
<span>Date:   Sun Nov 19 20:42:56 2023 +0100</span>

<span>Improve register-preview (bug#66394)</span>

<span>    A minibuffer is used now instead of read-key.</span>
    ...
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This commit crippled all user interaction with Emacs registers,
turning commands such as <code>C-x r s</code>, once smooth and frictionless, into
a cumbersome and painful mess. Concretely, instead of just typing the
key for the register you want to operate on, you now get a fully blown
minibuffer for inserting a single key. This is nonsensical in various
ways, but most staggering is probably the fact that you now need to
confirm your register selection by pressing another <code>RET</code>, effectively
doubling the work you have to do for the simplest task of specifying a
single character.
</p>
<p>
Emacs registers (used to) provide a perfect UX. Silky smooth, really.
But no more, not in GNU Emacs 30. It’s gone, without as much as a
<code>NEWS</code> entry to inform the unwary user about this regression.
</p>
<p>
Surely, it’s not too late to revert one bad change, right? That’s
what I thought, unfortunately the Emacs maintainers seem bent on
dismissing the community’s outcry in an unwarranted and misguided
attempt to save face.
</p>
<p>
In fact, the core problems with this change were brought up already in
the first technical <a href="https://yhetil.org/emacs/87sf67qqmp.fsf@web.de/">comment</a> regarding this patch proposal, from
Michael Heerdegen:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If your version is accepted, I would vote for an option to get the old
behavior back. Your intended behavior is safer but requires more keys
(at least confirmation with RET). Some people might prefer the old
way.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well, duh! If you’re gonna change long standing Emacs behavior, it
better be optional and backward compatible, people have been using
this thing for decades, after all. Hmm apparently, the patch author,
Thierry, doesn’t see it that way:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There is only RET as additional key and it is a good thing IMO as it
let the time to user to see what he is doing.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This rather arrogant statement, and the approach that underlies it,
led us to where we are today. After some further discussion, <a href="https://eshelyaron.com/notes/eli-zaretskii.html" title="Notes about Eli Zaretskii (Emacs maintainer)">Eli
Zaretskii</a> applied this patch to Emacs master. I’m not sure he
understood the breaking nature of this change when he did that, which
I think might be even more disconcerting.
</p>
<p>
Soon after, Bastien Guerry chimed in, saying:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I use registers ~100 times a day, so enhancements here are very
welcome, thanks!
</p>
<p>
I wonder about this [change], though. It badly hinders my usual flow,
where I do remember what registers I use and like to store new ones
quickly.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Sounds like a clear and honest testimony from an esteemed community
member. But wait, no, Thierry doesn’t think so, he thinks it’s all
for the better and his change is all right. At this point I got
somewhat involved, and seconded Bastien’s request to restore the
previous, perfectly good behavior, at least optionally. Thierry
wasn’t willing to fix this damage, so Eli asked me to help out:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
So maybe a better way forward is for someone, perhaps you Eshel, to
add whatever is needed to provide optionally the previous behavior?
</p>
<p>
Would you like to work on that?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Easy enough. I crafted and <a href="https://yhetil.org/emacs/m1wmtvnfpn.fsf@dazzs-mbp.home/">posted</a> a couple of patches that add some
bells and whistles from Thierry’s patch in an optional and compatible
manner. It’s really not that hard to make no harm in this case. But
my work was disregarded just as well, sadly. Thierry didn’t like how
I reverted his change to use the minibuffer for reading a single key,
which is exactly the root cause of the problems I tried to fix—and
in fact I did fix it, just not in Emacs master, but in my new fork.
</p>
<p>
Since then, <a href="https://yhetil.org/emacs/CA+Nei8MfEw_iDj3Xjbzop+7n-oqNp1jSJcweOgEQMKUkB3mifQ@mail.gmail.com/">another bug report</a> came in from an Emacs master branch
user that suffered from one of the consequences of this change (a
specific regression that I spelled out days before, but was ignored,
for some reason), and several users reached out to the Emacs
development in request to restore the previous behavior in an ongoing
thread titled <a href="https://yhetil.org/emacs/CAFgA-y2wUR0tGRk+RkUGn2TF2YoMyf3B=+78TGyDZP5+Ew2uyA@mail.gmail.com/">“Please, Restore Previous Behavior for
jump-to-register”</a>. Astonishingly, the maintainers seem insistent
not to budge, and Emacs 30 will thus likely suck.
</p>
<p>
I find the willingness of the Emacs maintainers to entertain this bad
behavior (of both a rouge developer and of Emacs itself) at the
expense of user experience, unacceptable. This demonstrates clear
disrespect for Emacs user preferences, and indeed their freedom.
</p>
<p>
For me, this freedom is the number one reason for using Emacs, so I
obviously won’t use an Emacs that forces on me weird breaking changes.
For that reason I’ve created a new Emacs branch, the “main” branch,
which was born from the master branch before this registers fiasco.
</p>
<p>
If these changes will be reverted before Emacs 30, I’ll surely
consider switching back to building Emacs from the upstream master
branch. But in the meantime, and for the foreseeable future, I’ll be
keeping my main branch up to date by cherry picking (only) good
changes from the master branch. And of course, I also improve it with
developments of my own.
</p>
<p>
If you’re interested, feel free to checkout my main branch from here:

I only remember doorknobs and something about affordances. Read refactoringUI as well, some vague shiny UI tips of which can't remember any but 'have decent spacing'. I still can't design even a simple form. I am starting to suspect that if one wants to be good at web design one needs to start doing lots of web design until one gets better. Reading books may come later to place that practical knowledge in some coherent mental framework.

I'm always on the lookout for materials that I can give my team and other developers to help them get better at design. It's not a course, but "The Non-Designer's Design Book" (ISBN 978-0133966152, Robin Williams) is the best material for design fundamentals I've found. It's very approachable for anyone and it's broadly applicable across all kinds of design. Everyone I have convinced to read it has loved it, and I've seen an improvement in output and understanding. I highly recommend this if you have an interest in design.<p>Refactoring UI is also valuable and can be impactful, though it's heavily web focused and is more like a Web Component Design Cookbook rather than foundational knowledge.

Erik is a former programmer who has taken the engineers mindset and systematically analyzed and broken down the various parts of UI design.  It is very practical, which was something that was lacking in most resources I found when I was in your position.</p><p>If anyone is interested, I would recommend starting with the UI course, which probably runs around $1000.  Unfortunately It is only available at certain intervals, probably every 6-8 weeks.</p><p>If the cost is intimidating, you can get a lot out of his blog, which will also give you a taste of how he thinks about design: <a href="https://www.learnui.design/blog/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.learnui.design/blog/</a>.

I find it funny how people always talk about "technical" founders but never about design founders even though design is often just as useful, if not more useful, especially in the early stages where you can build the best product in the world but if it doesn't look good, nobody will try it.<p>I am also especially bad at design and visual art skills in general. I recognize this and get plenty of feedback around it. So this year I set out to improve to at least try to get to "mediocre" instead of "terrible".</p><p>Refactoring UI and Erik Kennedys blog / class are mentioned and are great resources and I own both.</p><p>I did Dribbble's Figma UI design class which was $600. It's biggest strength is that its a cohort based class, and cohort classes tend to have much higher finishing rates than self-paced classes. Their instructor will review your Figma designs but only if you finish in time so if you want to get your $600 worth you better open up Figma, so I recommend it for that reason. Kennedy's is self-paced and while it's extremely high quality, I haven't even worked through most of it for this reason.</p><p>Of course, the single most important thing you can do is build lots of UIs. If you're like me, your UIs will suck, but if you do it more regularly, you will also notice more UI/UX techniques on other websites. I save all those in a Notion database organized by category and refer to them.</p><p>One last thing I almost never see mentioned but it was a really good piece of advice. I told someone that I was between hiring contractor designers for my project, and trying to improve at design and do it myself. One person told me, it's not mutually exclusive. So you can design an app, and it will probably look bad. Then hire an experienced UI/UX designer off Upwork to do a better job. And pay attention to the decisions they made and the decsions you made and compare the difference. Figma is a great tool these days because it's much more collaborative than just getting a big stack of PNGs or SVGs at the end, you can discuss design choices in Figma comments as the designer works.</p><p>One final thing I really struggle with that is worth noting - professional designers will make several versions and iterations of everything, each screen and each component on that screen. And then pick the best one. The Dribbble instructor said, the best design is almost never the first one. This is time consuming and tedious if you don't love design but it's how you get the best results.</p><p>If you just have a one-off project and don't truly care about improving at design, the simplest option is to hire a contractor. UI/UX is not something you learn in a weekend and then you're good to go, it's more like learning a language or an instrument in that you're either going to invest a lot of time to learn it well or you're going to suck. It's pretty affordable to hire-out because it's mostly up-front work.</p><p>Hiring contractors and spending for classes is the expensive route but spending money can expedite the process. But, there's lots of free resources if you're broke. The single most important thing is design a lot, and pay attention to other people's designs and what they're doing.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">ast-grep(sg)</h2>
<p dir="auto">ast-grep(sg) is a CLI tool for code structural search, lint, and rewriting.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2>
<p dir="auto">ast-grep is a AST-based tool to search code by pattern code. Think it as your old-friend <code>grep</code> but it matches AST nodes instead of text.
You can write patterns as if you are writing ordinary code. It will match all code that has the same syntactical structure.
You can use <code>$</code> sign + upper case letters as wildcard, e.g. <code>$MATCH</code>, to match any single AST node. Think it as REGEX dot <code>.</code>, except it is not textual.</p>
<p dir="auto">Try the <a href="https://ast-grep.github.io/playground.html" rel="nofollow">online playground</a> for a taste!</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Demo</h2>

<p dir="auto">If you find ast-grep interesting and useful for your work, please <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/HerringtonDarkholme">buy me a coffee</a>
so I can spend more time on the project!</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Feature Highlight</h2>
<p dir="auto">ast-grep's core is an algorithm to search and replace code based on abstract syntax tree produced by tree-sitter.
It can help you to do lightweight static analysis and massive scale code manipulation in an intuitive way.</p>
<p dir="auto">Key highlights:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">An intuitive pattern to find and replace AST.
ast-grep's pattern looks like ordinary code you would write every day. (You can call the pattern is isomorphic to code).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">jQuery like API for AST traversal and manipulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">YAML configuration to write new linting rules or code modification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Written in compiled language, with tree-sitter based parsing and utilizing multiple cores.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Beautiful command line interface :)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">ast-grep's vision is to democratize abstract syntax tree magic and to liberate one from cumbersome AST programming!</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If you are an open source library author, ast-grep can help your library users adopt breaking changes more easily.</li>
<li>if you are a tech lead in your team, ast-grep can help you enforce code best practice tailored to your business need.</li>
<li>If you are a security researcher, ast-grep can help you write rules much faster.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stealthy and multifunctional Linux malware that has been infecting telecommunications companies went largely unnoticed for two years until being documented for the first time by researchers on Thursday.</p>
<p>Researchers from security firm Group-IB have named the remote access trojan “Krasue,” after a nocturnal spirit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasue">depicted in Southeast Asian folklore </a> “floating in mid-air, with no torso, just her intestines hanging from below her chin.” The researchers chose the name because evidence to date shows it almost exclusively targets victims in Thailand and “poses a severe risk to critical systems and sensitive data given that it is able to grant attackers remote access to the targeted network.</p>
<p>According to the researchers:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Krasue is a Linux Remote Access Trojan that has been active since 20 and predominantly targets organizations in Thailand.</li>

<p>During the initialization phase, the rootkit conceals its own presence. It then proceeds to hook the <b>`kill()`</b> syscall, network-related functions, and file listing operations, thereby obscuring its activities and evading detection.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The researchers have so far been unable to determine precisely how Krasue gets installed. Possible infection vectors include through vulnerability exploitation, credential-stealing or -guessing attacks, or by unwittingly being installed as trojan stashed in an installation file or update masquerading as legitimate software.</p>

<p>Rootkits are a type of malware that hides directories, files, processes, and other evidence of its presence to the operating system it’s installed on. By hooking legitimate Linux processes, the malware is able to suspend them at select points and interject functions that conceal its presence. Specifically, it hides files and directories beginning with the names “auwd” and “vmware_helper” from directory listings and hides ports 52695 and 52699, where communications to attacker-controlled servers occur. Intercepting the kill() syscall also allows the trojan to survive Linux commands attempting to abort the program and shut it down.</p>

          fzf is a popular tool among command line hackers. But if you're an Emacs user, it's hard to use as it requires an interactive terminal. What if you could use Emacs to do the fuzzy finding instead of fzf?
        </section>

<p>Filtering long lists of output on the command line usually involves taking the list of items – maybe the output of <code>ls</code>, <code>git</code> or <code>find</code> – and doing something with it. If you’re lucky you can mechanically filter the list with pipes and <code>grep</code>. If you’re unlucky and you can’t think of a heuristic, you’ll have to sift through the output with a pager like <code>less</code> and remember the items you want to keep.</p><figure>
   <img src="https://www.masteringemacs.org/static/uploads/fzf.png" alt="fzf filtering output from apt-cache search intended for apt-get">
<figcaption><code>fzf</code> filtering output from <code>apt-cache search</code> intended for <code>apt-get</code></figcaption>
</figure><p>Typically you do this because you want to cherry pick a subset of the items and feed them into another command, like <code>rm</code>, <code>cat</code> or <code>apt-get</code> as the picture above illustrates.</p><p>But the manual way is tedious and slow. And that’s the problem <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> tries to solve. The premise is simple: you feed it (via stdin) a list of items, and it displays a curses-like window where you can “fuzzy find” and select the items you care about. It’s designed to slot into command substitutions and pipes — like an interactive <code>grep</code>.</p><p>So that got me thinking. There’s no reason why you can’t use Emacs to do this instead of <code>fzf</code>! Emacs has better fuzzy finding and it’s the text editor you’re already using, so why not use Emacs?</p><p>Another reason to ditch <code>fzf</code> is that you might be using <a href="https://masteringemacs.org/article/running-shells-in-emacs-overview">a shell and not a terminal emulator in Emacs</a>. It’s not impossible to run curses apps in <code>shell-mode</code>, but it is harder.</p><h2 id="ezf-emacs-fuzzy-finder">EZF: Emacs Fuzzy Finder</h2><figure>

<figcaption><code>ezf</code> filtering output from <code>apt-cache</code> before passing it back to the shell</figcaption>
</figure><p>So the game plan is simple:</p><dl><dt>Build a shell script</dt><dd><p>This is the shell-facing part that we feed into pipes and command substitution sub-shells.</p><p>It must talk to <code>emacsclient</code>, the client in the Emacs client-server duo. That way it’ll run in your existing Emacs instance and it won’t interrupt your workflow if you also use – as you well should! – Emacs as your shell or terminal emulator.</p></dd><dt>Write some Elisp glue code</dt><dd><p>We’ll need a few functions capable of letting you filter and select the match candidates you like. Luckily this is generally very easy.</p></dd><dt>Return the picked candidates</dt><dd><p>After matching and selecting the candidates we want to keep, we must return them from whence they came. We’ll need to be mindful of annoying bagatelles like proper quoting.</p></dd><dt>Make it easy to extend</dt><dd><p>It should be easy to extend or modify to suit individual tastes.</p><p>We’ll add a few command switches to <code>ezf</code> to highlight how easy it is to pass customizable switches through bash into Emacs.</p></dd></dl><h3 id="sending-to-emacss-standard-input">Sending to Emacs’s standard input</h3><p>Let’s start with the shell script. I’ve done it in <code>bash</code>. There’s a number of little gotchas and workarounds required for this to work well. So the script’s freighted with one or two annoying hacks.</p><p>Chiefly, it’s not possible to ask <code>emacsclient</code> or even <code>emacs</code> to read directly from a file descriptor device. So process substitution with <code>&lt;(ls ...)</code> is out. I don’t know why, as Emacs is absolutely 100% capable of <em>doing</em> it inside Emacs. So I’m chalking it up to oversight.</p><p>That means we have to work around that problem with real files. I’m using <code>mktemp</code> to <code>cat</code> standard input to a temporary file. To avoid clobbering your <code>tmpfs</code> with junk files, there’s a <code>trap</code> to clean up when the script exits.</p><p>Now all we need to do is add a little command argument parsing: I want <code>-c</code> to let us choose the completion tool to invoke in Emacs; and <code>-f</code> is there to pick the field offset to return. The latter is particularly useful if you have a line of text and you want just the first word, for example.</p><p>After that, there’s a little bit of house keeping in case you exit out of the selection process without picking anything. Oh, when you tell <code>emacsclient</code> to evaluate elisp it’ll use <code>prin1</code> to emit the representation of the Lisp object to standard output, and that forces quote symbols around strings, even if we don’t really want that. Sieving the output from Emacs through a pipe to <code>xargs</code> cunningly strips the quotes.</p><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

So I’ve kept things open and made it work with <code>completing-read</code> – well, specifically <code>completing-read-multiple</code> so you can pick multiple items.</p><p>If you’re unsure how that fits into <em>your</em> completion framework, then my article on <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/understanding-minibuffer-completion">understanding Minibuffer Completion</a> is a good place to start. If you want IDO to work with it, you’ll have to tweak the code yourself. Luckily I have <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/find-files-faster-recent-files-package">an example here</a> to get you started.</p><p>I’ve also made it work out of the box with Helm which, as we all know, is awesome. Helm in particular is perfect for this as it comes with great fuzzy matching, multiple selection <em>and</em> it’s easy to add custom actions like returning matches to the shell <em>and</em> opening them as files in Emacs, for example.</p><p>There’s three parts: two completion mechanisms and a generic wrapper that turns lists of candidates into usable output.</p><pre><code>(<span>defun</span><span> ezf-default </span>(filename)
  <span>"EZF completion with your default completion system."</span>
  (completing-read-multiple
   <span>"Pick a Candidate: "</span>
   (with-temp-buffer
     (insert-file-contents-literally filename <span>nil</span>)
     (string-lines (buffer-string) <span>t</span>))))</code></pre><p><code>completing-read-multiple</code> takes a prompt and a list of strings. And that’s all you need to get Emacs’s completion system to work. I create a temporary buffer to hold the file contents before it’s split up into lines. If you want NULL-separated output, this is the place to change it.</p><p>If you’re wondering why I’m using a buffer, you should read my article <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/why-emacs-has-buffers">Why Emacs has Buffers</a>.</p><pre><code>(<span>defun</span><span> ezf-helm </span>(filename)
  <span>"EZF completion with `helm'."</span>
  <span>;; Uncomment if you want Helm to full screen.</span>
  <span>;; (helm-set-local-variable 'helm-full-frame t)</span>
  (helm :sources
        (helm-build-in-file-source <span>"EZF Completion"</span> filename
          :action (<span>lambda</span> (_) (helm-marked-candidates)))))</code></pre><p>For Helm the solution is similar. I’m using Helm’s ability to build candidates directly from a file. If you want to add more than one action then I recommend you use <code>helm-make-actions</code> to build the alist.</p><p>Now for the generic wrapper. Its job is to take a list of strings you picked from a candidate function and turn it into something the shell can properly read. If you specified <code>-f</code> to <code>ezf</code> then it’ll also split the string and only use the field index you chose.</p><pre><code><span>;; If you start Emacs's server some other way, you can remove this.</span>
(server-start)

  <span>"Wrapper that calls COMPLETION-FN with FILENAME.</span>

<span>Optionally split each line of string by `ezf-separators' if FIELD</span>
<span>is non-nil and return FIELD.</span>

<span>If COMPLETING-FN is nil default to `ezf-default'."</span>
  (when-let (candidates (<span>funcall</span> (<span>or</span> completing-fn 'ezf-default) filename))
    (mapconcat (<span>lambda</span> (candidate)
                 (shell-quote-argument
                  (<span>if</span> field
                      (<span>nth</span> (<span>1-</span> field) (split-string candidate ezf-separators <span>t</span> <span>" "</span>))
                    candidate)))
               candidates
               <span>" "</span>)))</code></pre><p>Here the goal is simply to take a <code>filename</code> containing our candidates; an optional <code>completing-fn</code>, as set by passing <code>-c</code> to <code>ezf</code>; and an optional <code>field</code> index.</p><p><code>ezf-separators</code> is a regular expression to split each line by. So if you want NULL-delimited support then you can easily add that and a switch to go along with it.</p><p>Because we’re taking unsanitized candidates and passing them through our completion system, it’s good form to ensure the filtered candidates are properly escaped when we hand them back to the shell. That’s what <code>shell-quote-argument</code> does. <code>mapconcat</code> merely ensures the quoted candidates are space-separated as that’s what shells expect. (And if you want NULL separation you should change this also.)</p><p>Because the last value is by convention the value that is returned from a function in Lisp, we know that the output of <code>emacsclient</code> is the result of the <code>mapconcat</code> form if we selected any matches, and <code>nil</code> otherwise.</p><p>With all this in place it’s time to test it:</p><figure>

<figcaption>Fuzzy matching dictionary words with Emacs and <code>ezf</code></figcaption>
</figure><p>Yep. Looks good.</p><p>This tool is able to do most of the things you’d use <code>fzf</code> for, and all from within the comfort of your Emacs. It’ll work just fine in Eshell also if you don’t push it too hard. Eshell’s support for pipes and redirection is not as good as regular shells, but with a little bit of work it could be made to work there too, with or without the bash script. And of course you can use it from Terminals also: the ones you run from inside Emacs, and external ones also.</p><h2 id="example-use-cases">Example Use Cases</h2><p>Here’s a few examples of how you can use the tool. It goes without saying that it’s a bit threadbare compared to <code>fzf</code>, but I think it’s easy enough to extend to suit your own needs. This is also a great way to get your hands dirty with elisp if you have never done any before.</p><p>I’m going to point out that <code>M-x helm-locate</code> already does this, but you can use GNU <code>locate</code> to track down files matching a regex pattern and then open them in <code>emacsclient</code>:</p><pre><code>$ <span>emacsclient</span> <span>$(</span><span>locate</span> -r <span>'[.]py$'</span> <span>|</span> <span>ezf</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>GNU <code>locate</code> works by querying a database that updates whenever you call <code>updatedb</code>. It’s probably the one of fastest cached file searchers available today. You can have multiple databases with different configurations (one for your home directory and another for the whole file system) to further speed it up. I highly recommend you look into using it if you regularly sweep your file system looking for files.</p><p>Finding and installing packages with <code>apt-get</code> and <code>apt-cache</code>:</p><pre><code>$ <span>apt-get</span> install <span>$(</span><span>apt-cache</span> search <span>&lt;</span>term<span>&gt;</span> <span>|</span> <span>ezf</span> -f 1<span>)</span></code></pre><p>Change directories. Try playing around with the arguments to <code>find</code>, or use something simpler like <code>ls</code>:</p><pre><code>$ <span>cd</span> <span>$(</span><span>find</span> . -maxdepth 3 -type d <span>|</span> <span>ezf</span><span>)</span></code></pre><h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2><p>I think this is a pretty good example of how you can combine the power of Emacs and a little bit of gnarly shell script magic. And this is really just the beginning. You can take the shell script and hook it up to all manner of crazy Emacs stuff: <code>M-x dired</code>; sending stuff to a buffer for editing; and more.</p><p>You can also find it on Github here: <a href="https://github.com/mickeynp/ezf">EZF</a>.</p>

I started using Git super early, before GitHub existed. You may not believe me, but Git was the answer to all my prayers. All those previous systems had fundamental architectural flaws that made them a complete nightmare to use on a team for any serious work.</p><p>Git has no such problem. There’s nothing it can’t do. Instead, the only limitation is on the user being able to know how to get Git to do what they want it to do. Thankfully, that’s always solvable with a quick read of the documentation or web search.</p><p>I understand that people might want to make it easier, since the UI is complex, but that’s never going to work. If you abstract away the complexity of the UI, you will necessarily abstract away the power. If you abstract away the power, you are no longer solving all the problems that Git solved. People just don’t realize what problems are being solved because they never lived through those problems with the previous VCSes.</p><p>You know what’s easier than building a new VCS better than Git? You know what’s easier than using a different VCS from the rest of the world? You know what’s easier than designing a miraculous abstraction on top of Git?</p><p>Learning Git.</p><p>Whatever effort you are putting into seeking or building an alternative, instead put that effort towards becoming a Git expert. It will be a lot less effort with a lot more benefit. Trust me on this. It will be well worth it for your career and for your personal computing life as well.

The need for efficient version control systems is a constant and ongoing battle; you can pick the right data structures (for example, Git's issues with large files are more of a data structure problem than one of raw efficiency) but at the end of the day Python will often be behind on raw performance. Rust will hopefully let us embed the Jujutsu libraries inside other languages, something you can only achieve today in Git with something like libgit2. Finally, a lot of the infrastructure we get to use, like nextest and cargo-insta are simply fantastic even if I have my qualms about Cargo.<p>Most of the developers (some of them being former Mercurial and Git developers) including me generally seem to like it. Based on my own experience, I think it's a pretty excellent choice, but I'd be a bit biased as a die-hard Haskell/C programmer for something fast with types.

Once you leave the pull-commit-push-merge-rebase circle, you gotta hope that god helps you, because no one else will (or more like no one else can).<p>Unless of course you spend time to learn git, but its complexity is closing up to C++. And using a VCS shouldn't require that amount of effort. It should just get out the way (I must admit, git usually gets out of the way, as long as you use only the base commands... but when it gets in the way, that's when the fun starts)

Then (depending on need), let's add multiple repositories on the same single server for the same single user.  Then add multiple servers (including a git remote server).  Then add multiple users ... etc ... of course the magic of git is you can unfold those needs in any sequence.  Often when I find I do not understand something (that I thought I understood), I go back in scope to an earlier unfolding, eliminating other factors.<p>I'm sure git can be improved, but I think the biggest improvement comes from the user being improved with their understanding of the scope of capabilities.  I have yet to see a good tutorial on this (among the plethora of git tutorials out there).  This reminds me of the (excellent) video where the "Harvard Professor Explains Algorithms in 5 Levels of Difficulty" [1]</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkIvmfqX-t0" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkIvmfqX-t0</a></p><p>I would love to see a Channel where that is the entire theme - explaining everything in 5 levels of difficulty.</p><p>All this being said, at each of the "5 levels of difficulty" of git, are there improvements to be made.  I'm sure there are.  It would be good to focus the answer on each of those levels.

Of course the immediate consequence would be that you'd be able to roll back changes to branches but there'd be some more fundamental consequences as well. I'm pretty sure some of the problems with GUI's/wrappers around Git break down because there's no tracking of branches/tags.<p>Besides that it's pretty much endgame in my opinion if you consider only the functionality it's meant to solve. If another "better" VCS would ever become popular I feel it would have to be a drastic change to the way of working with VCS, even more drastic than SVN to Git was. There's some cruft in Git that could probably be taken away, and that would make Git better in a theoretical sense, but in the real world that would never happen (unless we get sideswiped by another industry or platform).

If you're looking at the main branch of a repository, what was the previous version of that branch?<p>The way we work around that missing feature is by tagging commits so we don't forget what revision a release was made at for example. A sequence of release tags basically is a meta branch, a history of the release branch, but managed manually instead of through git.

Codeberg is run by a non-profit and are very much aligned with my ideals. They are also slowly adding nice features like their Woodpecker CI.</p><p>One that is growing in popularity and is a little less "GitHub-y" is SourceHut (which also has Mercurial support).</p><p>The main issue is that GitHub has really cornered the market. They give so much out for free that is difficult for others to compete with and it has become the de-facto place to host your project. This can mean that hosting anywhere other than GitHub will limit discoverability and contributions from people if they don't want to make an account or work out how to deal with whatever forge you are using.</p><p>However one thing that is coming that may help alleviate some of that is forge federation which will allow you to interact with various forges from your "home" forge - which hopefully prevents the need to make an account to make PRs or raise issues.</p><p>Edit: I see your other comment now, what could a better GitHub be that supports a better-than-git VCS. Well there did used to be places to host Darcs projects like the Darcs Hub but I don't know if some of the newers ones like Pijul or Jujutsu have any forge support yet.</p><p>Edit2: Oh it seems Pijul has "The Nest" for hosting.

Git it so flexible, even things that it handles terribly by default, it handles
fine with layers: e.g., large binary files via git-lfs (<a href="https://git-lfs.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://git-lfs.com</a>) and merge conflicts in non-textual files by custom merge resolvers like Unity’s (<a href="https://flashg.github.io/GitMerge-for-Unity/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://flashg.github.io/GitMerge-for-Unity/</a>).</p><p>Perhaps in the future, almost everyone will keep using Git at the core, but have so many layers to make it more intuitive and provide better merges, that what they’re using barely resembles Git at all. This flexibility and the fact that nearly everything is designed for Git and integrates with Git, are why I doubt it’s ever going away.</p><p>Some alternatives for thought:</p><p>- pijul (<a href="https://pijul.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pijul.org</a>), a completely different VCS which allegedly has better merges/rebases. In beta, but I rarely hear about it nowadays and have heard more bad than good. I don’t think we can implement this alternate rebases in Git, but maybe we don’t need to; even after reading the website, I don’t understand why pijul’s merges are better, and in particular I can’t think of a concrete example nor does pijul provide one.</p><p>- Unison (<a href="https://www.unison-lang.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.unison-lang.org</a>). This isn’t a VCS, but a language with a radical approach to code representation: instead of code being text stored in files, code is ASTs referenced by hash and stored in essentially a database. Among other advantages, the main one is that you can rename symbols and they will automatically propagate to dependencies, because the symbols are referenced by their hash instead of their name. I believe this automatic renaming will be common in the future, whether it’s implemented by a layer on top of Git or alternate code representation like Unison (to be clear, Unison’s codebases are designed to work with Git, and the Unison project itself is stored in Git repos).</p><p>- SVN, the other widespread VCS. Google or ask ChatGPT “Git vs SVN” and you’ll get answers like this (<a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/svn-vs-git/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/svn-vs-git/</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/875" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://stackoverflow.com/a/875</a>). Basically, SVN is easier to understand and handles large files better, Git is decentralized and more popular. But what about the differences which can’t be resolved by layers, like lazygit for intuition and git-lfs for large files? It seems to me like even companies with centralized private repositories use Git, meaning Git will probably win in the long term, but I don’t work at those companies so I don’t really know.</p><p>- Mercurial and Fossil, the other widespread VCSs. It seems these are more similar to Git and the main differences are in the low-level implementation (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/892688" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://stackoverflow.com/a/892688</a>, <a href="https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/fossil-v-git.wiki#:~:text=Both%20Fossil%20and%20Git%20store,emphasis%20on%20the%20entire%20DAG" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/fossil-v-git.wiki#...</a>.). It actually seems like most people prefer Mercurial and Fossil over Git and would use them if they had the same popularity, or at least if they had Git’s popularity and Git had Mercury or Fossil’s. But again, these VCSs are so similar that with layers, you can probably create a Git experience which has their advantages and almost copies their UI.

Then the recursive merge of the two branches into each other cannot tell which AB pair in branch 2 the X from branch 1 should be inserted into, because it never sees the first commit of branch 2 which tells you that the "original" AB is the one after the G. `recursive` cannot distinguish between "AXBGAB" and "ABGAXB" as possibilities. A merge algorithm which looks at every commit can know that "ABGAXB" is more faithful to the actual sequence of events, because it knows which AB pair the X was inserted into on branch 1.<p>(Another plausibly correct answer of course would be "AXBGAXB", but again `recursive` doesn't know enough to guess this answer.)

It's about as basic as it can be. E.g. even zdiff3 doesn't give you quite enough information to resolve some conflicts (you want the diff for the change that introduced the conflict).

Whether <i>I</i> will ever change my VCS, again, ever, that is an entirely different question. I've been through so many of them (RCS; a bit of CVS; a bit of Subversion which promised to be CVS-without-the-flaws, which it was not; Mercurial, because hey it was written in Python, so must be good, right? right?; <i>finally</i> Git; and of course the usual `report-v4-revision-good-one.doc` renaming game; plus a plethora of backup solutions, some really bad ones among them)—so <i>many</i> of them I'd be loathe to switch to yet another one, except <i>maybe</i> Fossil, which I almost did.</p><p>So yeah, I had totally forgotten about <a href="https://fossil-scm.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://fossil-scm.org</a> ; the reason it didn't become my go-to solution is probably mainly the fault of github.com, which I find too good to be ignored, and I don't want an 'impedance mismatch' between my system and their system. But maybe it would be doable and maybe Fossil is good enough to be worth it; at any rate, go read their docs, especially where they compare themselves directly to Git and give lots of good reasons for their way of doing things. This is the same people who are doing SQLite, so I'd say a trustworthy source of reliably top quality software.</p><p>Other than that, my personal way of dealing with the complexities of Git is to avoid using parts that I don't need or don't know about well enough (i.e. almost all of it). I use it to check in changes, give one line of comment, and upload to github.com; then of course cloning and updating existing repos as well as setting up a new ones is within my skill set. Branching and merging not so much. So it's like `git` plus `clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, that's all; also, I use Sublime Merge for part of these (reviewing changes, adding related changed chunks, commit) which I must recommend for the piece of fine software that it is.</p><p>I also at some point toyed with gitless (I think it was called) which promised to be Git, but simpler for the simple things and you can always fall back to Git proper where called for; this I find a good proposition that I like (Markdown: fall back to HTML; CoffeeScript: fall back to JavaScript) but somehow gitless didn't stick with me; I <i>guess</i> that's b/c I've already tempered down my usage of Git to a point near absolute zero, and command line history + Sublime Merge does the rest.
