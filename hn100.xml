            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://rubenerd.com/xfce-is-great/">https://rubenerd.com/xfce-is-great/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46584173">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="articleBody">
<p>I have not been shy talking about <a href="https://rubenerd.com/tag/xfce/">my love</a> of <a href="https://xfce.org/">Xfce</a> over the years here. The desktop environment has been a trusted friend ever since I first loved it on the late Cobind Desktop (still the high water mark of desktop Linux, as far as I’m concerned).</p>
<p>I’m glad to see I’m not the only one. David Gerard of <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/">Pivot to AI</a> fame recently shared <a href="https://reddragdiva.dreamwidth.org/582674.html">this post he wrote in 2012</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The question with minimal desktops is the fine line between as simple as possible and just a bit too simple. How much basic stuff do you have to add back? 4.8 took it slightly far, 4.10 is almost Just Right. XFCE is so far a case study in Not Fucking It Up; I hope they never go to version 5, and just update 4 forever.</p></blockquote>
<p>This (a) longevity and (2) getting the balance right cannot be overstated. Here’s my current Xfce desktop, for example:</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2026/xfce2008@1x.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2026/xfce2008@2x.jpg 2x"></p></figure>
<p>Except, <strong>no it isn’t</strong>. That’s a screenshot of my <a href="https://rubenerd.com/p1185/" title="Fun with Xfce, part one">FreeBSD desktop from 2008</a>, with the bright and clear Tango Iconset (speaking of high-water marks). Remember when iconography was discernable at a glance? Aka, functional as icons? But I digress.</p>
<p>Xfce in 2025 (no, 2026, damn it!) is just as easy to understand, light, and fast as it first was booting Cobind on my <a href="http://retro.rubenerd.com/brio.htm">HP Brio</a> when I was in school, or when building it from source in FreeBSD ports. Though unlike a barebones window manager or other “light” DEs, Xfce feels usable, feature complete, and designed by someone who understands why people use desktop computers (cough GNOME).</p>
<p>I do use KDE on my primary desktop. Version 4 was a mess, but they’ve made <em>massive</em> improvements, especially within the last year. I’m not sure how much this had to do with the Steam Deck, and a new generation of people realising that… wait… I can run stuff on this box other than games? There’s a desktop here!? But my laptops all run Xfce, and I’m half-tempted to move back to it on the desktop.</p>
<p>I’m with David here. I hope they never feel the need to “innovate” with “disruption” for “UX”. The switch to the Thunar file manager was the last major user-facing change I can remember, and it was great.</p>
<p>I’m not suggesting we reached peak UI with Xfce, but no desktop since has made a compelling case (for me) for its replacement. I love, <em>love</em>, <strong>love</strong> that Xfce is maintained this way in spite of all the industry pressures to turn it into something else.</p>
<h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h3>
<p>I stopped writing posts like this for years, out of fear of how people from specific desktop environments would respond. If you’re about to write me an angry screed, know that I will immediately delete it and block you, <a href="https://rubenerd.com/people-who-need-to-run-windows/" title="A thread about people who need to run Windows">just as I did last time</a>. Both yours and my time are better spent.</p>
<p>I also know (sigh) this disclaimer will be ignored, so I’m questioning why I’m even bothering. Maybe I’m a sucker for punishment.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Claude Code and Claude Opus 4.5 have poured fuel on the hype. LLM tools existed before, but they’re better than ever now, so a lot more people are paying attention. But we’re not entering a golden age of SaaS. We’re entering an era of personal, disposable software—where engineering shifts from writing code to shaping systems, and engineers are still required for exactly that reason.</p>
<h2>The Shift in Modern Development</h2>
<p><strong>Claude Code</strong> is taking over my feed right now, and for good reason. What’s interesting isn’t just that developers are jumping on it—it’s that <strong>"builders" and makers</strong> who previously relied on platforms like Lovable or Replit are migrating to it.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, those tools are still perfectly viable for shipping fast. But we’re seeing a clear shift as people rediscover the inherent beauty of a <strong>CLI-first workflow</strong>. When you move the interaction into the <strong>terminal</strong>, the abstraction layer thins out. You aren't just following a managed UI's happy path; you're the one in control.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The collapse of the barrier to entry</h2>
<p>What are people actually building with these tools? If you look around, the answer is: almost everything. In fact, we’ve reached a point of saturation. On one hand, we are witnessing the <strong>true democratisation of software creation</strong>. The barrier to entry has effectively collapsed. For the first time, <strong>non-developers</strong> aren't just consumers of software - they are the <strong>architects of their own tools</strong>.</p>
<p>In the past, if you had a specific problem, you’d spend hours searching for a SaaS product that solved 80% of it. Today, the workflow has shifted. People are opening a CLI or a voice interface and simply describing what they need. We’re seeing a surge in <strong>"personal software"</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>subscription tracker</strong> tailored to a specific budget style</li>
<li>A <strong>Chrome extension</strong> that solves one very niche data entry problem</li>
<li>A <strong>fitness app</strong> with an interface exactly how the user wants it</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a massive shift. <strong>Software is becoming a personal utility</strong> you generate, rather than a commodity you buy.</p>
<h2>From SaaS to Scratchpads</h2>
<p>We’re entering a new era of software development where the goal isn't always longevity. For years, the industry has been obsessed with building "platforms" and "ecosystems," but the tide is shifting toward something more ephemeral. We're moving from SaaS to scratchpads.</p>
<p>A lot of this new software isn't meant to live forever. In fact, it’s the opposite. People are increasingly building tools to solve a single, specific problem exactly once—and then discarding them. It is software as a disposable utility, designed for the immediate "now" rather than the distant "later."</p>
<p>What makes this viable today is a specific technical philosophy: CLI-first interfaces, local data, and zero onboarding. When you remove the friction of signing up, configuring a database, or navigating a complex UI, the cost of creating a tool drops so low that "temporary" becomes a feature, not a bug. If it takes five minutes to spin up a custom solution for a one-off task, you don't need it to persist.</p>
<p>The contrast with the traditional SaaS model is stark. SaaS is inherently built to optimize for retention, lock-in, and expansion. It’s a business model designed to keep you inside the ecosystem and growing your footprint. Bespoke tools, on the other hand, optimize for immediacy and control. They don't care about your lifetime value as a customer; they only care about solving the task at hand.</p>
<p>In many ways, this is a return to how spreadsheets were originally used. You didn't open a spreadsheet to build a permanent, multi-year database; you used it as a scratchpad to reason through a problem, calculate the results, and move on.</p>
<p>In this new landscape, Claude Code is Excel for developers—a powerful, flexible utility for solving immediate problems—rather than Shopify for founders, which is built to be a permanent foundation for a business. It’s about getting the job done, and then letting the tool go.</p>
<p>This also explains why the next part matters: generating software quickly is one thing; making it survive contact with the real world is another.</p>
<h2><strong>Code Is Cheap. Software Is Still Expensive.</strong></h2>
<p>Here is the reality of the current "AI-native" era: code has become cheap, but software remains incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>LLMs have effectively killed the cost of generating lines of code, but they haven’t touched the cost of truly understanding a problem. We’re seeing a flood of "apps built in a weekend," but most of these are just thin wrappers around basic CRUD operations and third-party APIs. They look impressive in a Twitter demo, but they often crumble the moment they hit the friction of the real world.</p>
<p>The real cost of software isn’t the initial write; it’s the maintenance, the edge cases, the mounting UX debt, and the complexities of data ownership. These "fast" solutions are brittle.</p>
<p>The subscription tracker breaks the moment a bank changes its CSV export format. The Chrome extension dies the second a target website’s DOM shifts. The fitness app becomes unusable as soon as a user needs robust offline support or reliable data sync.</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve seen plenty of doomsaying on Hacker News, Reddit, and Twitter about "the end of software engineering." This misses the point entirely. We aren't witnessing the end of the profession; we’re entering a new era of it.</p>
<p>The value of an engineer is shifting away from the "how" of syntax and toward the "what" and "why" of systems. Real engineering lies in the abstractions and the architecture. It’s about knowing how to structure a system that lasts, understanding why a specific rate-limiting strategy is necessary, knowing how to manage a distributed cache, and knowing exactly where <em>not</em> to store your environment variables.</p>
<p>AI often feels powerful because it hides the complexity, but as an engineer, your job is to manage that complexity, not ignore it. The tools have changed, but the fundamental requirement for engineering rigour has never been higher.</p>
<h2>The distribution illusion</h2>
<p>But there is a flip side. With the barrier to entry gone, the <strong>noise level</strong> has reached an all-time high. My feeds are currently flooded with <strong>"AI entrepreneurs"</strong> claiming <strong>five-figure monthly recurring revenue (MRR)</strong> for apps they built in an afternoon.</p>
<p>In many cases, these claims are highly suspect. When you see a creator with no existing distribution and no clear <span><strong>"moat"</strong></span> claiming $10,000 in MRR on a weekend project, it’s usually a play for engagement rather than a reflection of business reality.</p>
<p>Some of these stories are almost certainly true but in most cases, these aren't actually blueprints for technical innovation. They are marketing case studies. These individuals succeed because they have mastered the art of capturing attention in a crowded landscape, not just because they have an AI co-pilot.</p>
<p>We’ve entered an era where the ability to generate code is no longer the bottleneck. The <strong>real challenge has shifted to distribution</strong> and, more importantly, distinguishing the <strong>genuine utility</strong> from the "get-rich-quick" posturing that has become so prevalent in the industry.</p>
<p>These people haven't stumbled upon a secret shortcut; they have simply found a way to execute their existing advantages faster (and potentially unlocked it in the first place if learning to code was rightfully too big of an undertaking for a side project idea).</p>
<p>There is a useful framing for this shift: AI has effectively removed engineering leverage as a primary differentiator. When any developer can use an LLM to build and deploy a complex feature in a fraction of the time it used to take, the ability to write code is no longer the competitive advantage it once was. It is no longer enough to just be a "builder."</p>
<p>Instead, success now hinges on factors that are much harder to automate. Taste, timing, and deep, intuitive understanding of your audience matter more than ever. You can generate a product in a weekend, but that is worthless if you are building the wrong thing or launching it to a room full of people who aren't listening.</p>
<p>In this new environment, the code has become the easy part. The hard part remains exactly what it has always been: finding a way to get people to care.</p>
<h2>Who wins</h2>
<p>First, you have domain experts who are stuck with boring, repetitive problems. Then there are the internal teams building throwaway tooling, the kind of scripts and internal apps that need to work immediately rather than look perfect. Power users also see a massive gain here, particularly when they are looking to replace brittle, manual workflows with something more robust. Finally, it is a win for those engineers who prioritise ownership of the solution over high-gloss polish.</p>
<p>And yes — tools like Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Code, and Cursor are genuinely useful for engineers. They are remarkably good at removing boilerplate, implementing features, and writing unit tests. One of my favourite use cases lately, especially since starting a new job, is generating personalised documentation and walkthroughs of features to get up to speed on the product codebase and how all the nuance works - it's been extremely helpful in getting up to speed.</p>
<p>But here is the reality: LLMs are not perfect at writing code - even if it compiles first time. Even with high quality prompting and clear rules, these models still make mistakes. Speaking as someone who uses these tools every day, you cannot simply trust the output outright. You still have to review the code as if it were a pull request from a teammate. You have to read the logic, check the assumptions, and often make manual edits to get it right.</p>
<p>After all, you'll likely be sending this to a teammate for a review (and maybe Code Rabbit I guess) - is it fair to make them review something you didn't write or even bother to check?</p>
<p>These tools help you move faster, but they do not replace the need for a critical eye or your years of experience and do not understand the overall problem space better than you.</p>
<hr>
<p>The hype makes it look like we’re entering a golden age of SaaS. We aren’t. We’re entering an era of personal software: tools you generate to solve a problem, and then move on.</p>
<p>With twenty dollars, a few hours of spare time, and a bit of patience, almost anyone can ship a functional application. We are entering the era of "personal software," where the gap between an initial idea and a working product is narrower than ever before.</p>
<p>In this new reality, engineering expertise remains incredibly valuable, but the nature of the role is shifting. Relevance is not fading. Instead, it is about leveraging these tools to build at a higher level than was previously possible. True expertise is now required to steer these systems and provide the technical oversight that LLMs currently lack.</p>
<p>While AI is undeniably good at writing code, it remains poor at architecting maintainable, distributable, and scalable systems. This is where non-technical leaders who think they can fire their development teams are making a significant mistake. Until we see the arrival of an artificial intelligence that renders this entire discussion moot, believing that technical expertise can be replaced by a prompt is a strategic error. Building robust software still requires a human who understands the underlying principles of the craft.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that while the tools have changed, the fundamentals of good engineering have not.</p>
<p>While barrier to entry may be gone - judgment, taste, and responsibility are still the job.</p>

                    <p>Good evening.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June. That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings.</p>

<p>I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.</p>

<p>This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.</p>

<p>This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.</p>

<p>I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats. I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do, with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Not that long ago I became aware of Justine Tunney’s <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan">cosmopolitan libc</a> project. It’s a toolkit that allows you to compile C source code into a single binary that runs natively on multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, various flavours of BSD, even including booters.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, back then the project didn’t seem to support GUI interfaces and produces quite swollen binaries. Hence I decided to take a stab at a similar (simpler? harder? up to you to decide) challenge: create a video game (&lt;16 KiB) that runs natively on Windows, Linux and in the Browser, all from a single source file.</p>
<h2 id="the-game">The Game<a href="#the-game" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>It’s a pretty standard Snake game with the same rules and interface on all platforms. You control a snake that grows longer as it eats food, and the goal is to avoid running into walls. The snake is controlled using either the arrow keys or WASD keys. It can be terminated via <code>ESC</code> (if permissible by the platform), reset via <code>R</code>, and paused via <code>P</code>. Spacebar starts the game.</p>
<p>The game keeps track of your score. Each piece of food eaten increases your score by 10 points, except yellow fruit (which spawns with a 15% chance) that gives you 20 points. Fruit spawns at a fixed rate and despawns after a certain time if not eaten. The despawn timer is proportional to the speed of the snake at the time of spawning, which itself is proportional to the snake’s length.</p>
<p>Once ten fruit are eaten, the game proceeds to the next level, randomizing the walls’ layout. The maze is created as to ensure that there is always a path from the snake’s head to any piece of food. The initial placement of the snake is also randomized, but always in a position that has at least five empty tiles in the direction the snake is facing.</p>
<p><a href="https://iczelia.net/static/snake/snake.com"><strong>Download the game here (13,772 bytes)</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-polyglot">The Polyglot<a href="#the-polyglot" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>I implemented the game three times in total: once in C for the i686 Visual C platform using WinAPI, once in C for the x86_64 Linux platform using clang and X11, and once in JavaScript for the browser using HTML5 Canvas. Each implementation is around 3-5 KiB in size when compiled/minified.</p>
<p>The Windows implementation was produced using a compressing script that prepends a decompressing stub. This stub has a quite unusual PE header that has many freely controllable bytes after the <code>MZ</code> signature. This allows us to place a shell script there that skips over the remainder of the file, rendering the (valid) PE executable runnable on Windows while also making the entire file a valid shell script, that will do (thus far) nothing on Linux.</p>
<p>Because the PE file is so awkward, we rely on Windows’ apphelp mechanism. Without compatibility mode, executing for the first time will yield the message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000005). Click OK to close the application.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which should disappear after re-running.</p>
<p>The Linux implementation was produced using a similar approach; we use <code>lzma</code> for decompression and a small shell dropper that extracts the compressed ELF64 binary and runs it, skipping over the head and the tail of the file.</p>
<p>The HTML version is also packed and abuses the fact that browsers will happily process all the benign garbage at the start of the file before reaching the actual HTML content. Then we make it invisible/unobtrusive through a bit of CSS magic.</p>
<p>Finally, we concatenate all three files together in such an order that each platform will pick the correct part of the file to execute. The final file is exactly 13,312 bytes in size.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-body">
        <p>The software industry sits at a strange inflection point. AI coding has evolved from autocomplete on steroids to agents that can autonomously execute development tasks. The economic boom that fueled tech’s hiring spree has given way to an efficiency mandate: companies now often favor profitability over growth, experienced hires over fresh graduates, and smaller teams armed with better tools.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a new generation of developers is entering the workforce with a different calculus: pragmatic about career stability, skeptical of hustle culture, and raised on AI assistance from day one.</p>

<p>What happens next is genuinely uncertain. Below are five critical questions that may shape software engineering through 2026, with two contrasting scenarios for each. These aren’t really predictions, but lenses for preparation. The goal is a clear roadmap for handling what comes next, grounded in current data and tempered by the healthy skepticism this community is known for.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="1-the-junior-developer-question">1. The Junior developer question</h2>

<p><strong>The bottom line: Junior developer hiring could collapse as AI automates entry-level tasks, or rebound as software spreads into every industry. Both futures require different survival strategies.</strong></p>

<p>The traditional pathway of “learn to code, get junior job, grow into senior” is wobbling. A <a href="https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/ai-is-making-it-harder-for-junior-developers-to-get-hired">Harvard study of 62 million workers</a> found that when companies adopt generative AI, junior developer employment drops by about 9-10% within six quarters, while senior employment barely budges. <a href="https://restofworld.org/2025/engineering-graduates-ai-job-losses/">Big tech hired 50% fewer fresh graduates</a> over the past three years. As <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">one engineer cynically put it</a>: ~”Why hire a junior for $90K when an AI coding agent costs less?”</p>

<p>This isn’t just AI. <a href="https://www.2ndorderthinkers.com/p/are-junior-level-jobs-really-killed">Macro factors like rising interest rates and post-pandemic corrections</a> hit around 2022, before AI tools became widespread. But AI has accelerated the trend. A single senior engineer with AI assistance can now produce what used to require a small team. Companies are quietly not hiring juniors more than they’re firing anyone.</p>

<p>The flip scenario: AI unlocks massive demand for developers across every industry, not just tech. Healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, and finance all start embedding software and automation. Rather than replacing developers, AI becomes a force multiplier that spreads development work into domains that never employed coders. We’d see more entry-level roles, just different ones: “AI-native” developers who quickly build automations and integrations for specific niches.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">Bureau of Labor Statistics still projects ~15% growth</a> in software jobs from 2024 to 2034. If businesses use AI to expand output rather than strictly cut headcount, <a href="https://www.2ndorderthinkers.com/p/are-junior-level-jobs-really-killed">they’ll need humans to seize the opportunities AI creates</a>.</p>

<p>The long-term risk of the pessimistic scenario is often overlooked: today’s juniors are tomorrow’s senior engineers and tech leaders. Cut off the talent pipeline entirely and you create a leadership vacuum in 5-10 years. <a href="https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/ai-is-making-it-harder-for-junior-developers-to-get-hired">Industry veterans call this the “slow decay”</a>: an ecosystem that stops training its replacements.</p>

<p><strong>What to do about it:</strong></p>

<p><em>Junior developers:</em> Make yourself AI-proficient and versatile. Demonstrate that one junior plus AI can match a small team’s output. Use AI coding agents (Cursor/Antigravity/Claude Code/Gemini CLI) to build bigger features, but understand and explain every line if not most. Focus on skills AI can’t easily replace: communication, problem decomposition, domain knowledge. Look at adjacent roles (QA, DevRel, data analytics) as entry points. Build a portfolio, especially projects integrating AI APIs. Consider apprenticeships, internships, contracting, or open source. Don’t be “just another new grad who needs training”; be an immediately useful engineer who learns quickly.</p>

<p><em>Senior developers:</em> Fewer juniors means more grunt work landing on your plate. Lean on automation for routine tasks, but don’t do everything yourself. Set up CI/CD, linters, and AI-assisted testing to catch basic issues. Mentor unofficially through open source or coaching colleagues in other departments. <a href="https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/ai-is-making-it-harder-for-junior-developers-to-get-hired">Be frank with management about the risks of all-senior teams</a>. If junior demand rebounds, be ready to onboard effectively and delegate in ways that use AI. Your value is in multiplying the whole team’s output, not just your own code.</p>

<h2 id="2-the-skills-question">2. The Skills question</h2>

<p><strong>The bottom line: Core programming skills could atrophy as AI writes most code, or become more critical than ever as human developers focus on oversight. The coming years determine whether we trade understanding for speed.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/09/10/ai-vs-gen-z/">84% of developers now use AI assistance regularly</a>. For many, the first instinct when facing a bug or new feature isn’t to write code from scratch, but to compose a prompt and stitch together AI-generated pieces. Entry-level coders are skipping the “hard way”: they might never build a binary search tree from scratch or debug a memory leak on their own.</p>

<p>The skillset is shifting from implementing algorithms to knowing how to ask the AI the right questions and verify its output. <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">The first rung of the ladder now demands prompting and validating AI</a> rather than demonstrating raw coding ability. Some senior engineers worry this produces a generation who can’t code well independently, a kind of deskilling. AI-generated code introduces subtle bugs and security vulnerabilities that less-experienced developers might miss.</p>

<p>The counter-scenario: as AI handles the routine 80%, humans focus on the hardest 20%. Architecture, tricky integrations, creative design, edge cases: the problems machines alone can’t solve. Rather than making deep knowledge obsolete, AI’s ubiquity makes human expertise more important than ever. This is the “high-leverage engineer” who uses AI as a force multiplier but must deeply understand the system to wield it effectively.</p>

<p>If everyone has AI coding agent access, what distinguishes great developers is knowing when the AI is wrong or suboptimal. <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">As one senior engineer put it</a>: “The best software engineers won’t be the fastest coders, but those who know when to distrust AI.”</p>

<p>Programming shifts: less typing boilerplate, more reviewing AI output for logical errors, security flaws, and mismatches with requirements. Critical skills become software architecture, system design, performance tuning, and security analysis. <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">AI can produce a web app quickly, but an expert engineer ensures the AI followed security best practices</a> and didn’t introduce race conditions.</p>

<p>Developer discourse in 2025 was split. Some admitted they hardly ever write code “by hand” and think coding interviews should evolve. Others argued that skipping fundamentals leads to more firefighting when AI’s output breaks. <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">The industry is starting to expect engineers to bring both</a>: AI speed and foundational wisdom for quality.</p>

<p><strong>What to do about it:</strong></p>

<p><em>Junior developers:</em> Use AI as a learning tool, not a crutch. When AI coding agents (Cursor/Antigravity/Claude Code/Gemini CLI) suggest code review why it works, identify weaknesses. Occasionally disable your AI helper and write key algorithms from scratch. Prioritize CS fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, complexity, memory management. Implement projects twice, once with AI, once without, and compare. Learn prompt engineering and tool mastery. Train yourself in rigorous testing: write unit tests, read stack traces without immediately asking AI, get comfortable with debuggers. Deepen complementary skills AI can’t replicate: system design, user experience intuition, concurrency reasoning. Show you can both crank out solutions with AI and tackle thorny issues when it fails.</p>

<p><em>Senior developers:</em> Position yourself as the guardian of quality and complexity. Sharpen your core expertise: architecture, security, scaling, domain knowledge. Practice modeling systems with AI components and think through failure modes. Stay current on vulnerabilities in AI-generated code. Embrace your role as mentor and reviewer: define where AI use is acceptable and where manual review is mandatory (payment or safety code). Lean into creative and strategic work; let the junior+AI combo handle routine API hookups while you decide which APIs to build. Invest in soft skills and cross-domain knowledge. Stay current on new tools and best practices. Double down on what makes a human developer indispensable: sound judgment, system-level thinking, and mentorship.</p>

<h2 id="3-the-role-question">3. The Role question</h2>

<p><strong>The bottom line: The developer role could shrink into limited auditing (overseeing AI-generated code) or expand into a pivotal orchestrator position designing and governing AI-driven systems. Either way, adding value means more than just coding.</strong></p>

<p>The extremes here are stark. In one vision, developers see their creative responsibilities diminished. Rather than building software, they mostly audit and babysit AI outputs. AI systems (or “citizen developers” using no-code platforms) handle production; human developers review auto-generated code, check for errors, bias, or security issues, and approve deployments. Maker becomes checker. The joy of code creation replaced by the anxiety of risk management.</p>

<p>There are reports of engineers spending more time evaluating AI-generated pull requests and managing automated pipelines, less time crafting code from scratch. Programming feels less like creative problem-solving and more like compliance. As one engineer lamented: “I don’t want to end up as a code janitor, cleaning up what the AI throws over the wall.”</p>

<p>The alternative future is far more interesting: developers evolve into high-level orchestrators, combining technical, strategic, and ethical responsibilities. AI “workers” mean human developers take on an architect or general contractor role, designing the overall system, deciding which tasks go to which AI or software component, weaving solutions from many moving parts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4062024/demand-for-junior-developers-softens-as-ai-takes-over.html">A CEO of a low-code platform articulated this vision</a>: in an “agentic” development environment, engineers become “composers,” orchestrating ensembles of AI agents and software services. They won’t write every note themselves, but they define the melody: architecture, interfaces, how agents interact. This role is interdisciplinary and creative: part software engineer, part system architect, part product strategist.</p>

<p>The optimistic take: as AI handles rote work, developer roles shift toward higher-value activities by necessity. Jobs may become more interesting. Someone has to decide what the AI should build, verify the product makes sense, and continuously improve it.</p>

<p>Which way it goes may depend on how organizations choose to integrate AI. Companies that see AI as labor replacement might trim dev teams and ask remaining engineers to keep automations running. Companies that see AI as a way to amplify their teams might keep headcounts similar but have each engineer deliver more ambitious projects.</p>

<p><strong>What to do about it:</strong></p>

<p><em>Junior developers:</em> Seek opportunities beyond just writing code. Volunteer for test case writing, CI pipeline setup, or application monitoring: skills aligned with an auditor/custodian role. Keep your creative coding alive through personal projects so you don’t lose the joy of building. Develop a systems mindset: learn how components communicate, what makes APIs well-designed. Read engineering blogs and case studies of system designs. Familiarize yourself with AI and automation tools beyond code generation: orchestration frameworks, AI APIs. Improve communication skills, written and verbal. Write documentation as if explaining to someone else. Ask senior colleagues not just “Does my code work?” but “Did I consider the right things?” Prepare to be verifier, designer, and communicator, not just coder.</p>

<p><em>Senior developers:</em> Lean into leadership and architectural responsibilities. Shape the standards and frameworks that AI and junior team members follow. Define code quality checklists and ethical AI usage policies. Stay current on compliance and security topics for AI-produced software. Focus on system design and integration expertise; volunteer to map data flows across services and identify failure points. Get comfortable with orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, Airflow, serverless frameworks, agent orchestration tools). Double down on your role as technical mentor: more code reviews, design discussions, technical guidelines. Hone your ability to quickly assess someone else’s (or something’s) code and give high-level feedback. Develop product and business sense; understand why features get built and what customers care about. Shadow a product manager or join customer feedback sessions. Protect your creative passion through prototypes, hackathons, or emerging tech research. Evolve from coder to conductor.</p>

<h2 id="4-the-specialist-vs-generalist-question">4. The Specialist vs. Generalist question</h2>

<p><strong>The bottom line: Narrow specialists risk finding their niche automated or obsolete. The fast-changing, AI-infused landscape rewards T-shaped engineers: broad adaptability with one or two deep skills.</strong></p>

<p>Given how quickly models, tools and frameworks rise and fall, betting your career on a single technology stack is risky. A guru in a legacy framework might suddenly find themselves in less demand when a new AI tool handles that tech with minimal human intervention. Developers who specialize narrowly in “a single stack, framework or product area” might wake up to find that area declining or redundant.</p>

<p>Think of COBOL developers, Flash developers, or mobile game engine specialists who didn’t pivot when the industry moved. What’s different now is the pace of change. AI automation can make certain programming tasks trivial, undercutting roles that revolved around those tasks. A specialist who only knows one thing (fine-tuning SQL queries, slicing Photoshop designs into HTML) could find AI handling 90% of that work.</p>

<p>Hiring managers chase the newest niche. A few years ago everyone wanted cloud infrastructure specialists; now there’s a surge in AI/ML engineers. Those who specialized narrowly in yesterday’s technology feel stalled as that niche loses luster.</p>

<p>The opposite outcome is specialization in a new form: the “versatile specialist” or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMHneaMO-dg">T-shaped developer</a>. Deep expertise in one or two areas (the vertical stroke), broad familiarity with many others (the horizontal stroke). <a href="https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/beyond-full-stack-the-rise-of-the-t-shaped-developer-a4afd757d976">These engineers become the “glue” in multidisciplinary teams</a>; they communicate with specialists of other stripes and fill gaps when needed.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/beyond-full-stack-the-rise-of-the-t-shaped-developer-a4afd757d976">Companies no longer want developers who are either too shallow or too narrowly focused</a>; they want a strong core competency plus ability to work across the stack. Part of the reason is efficiency: a T-shaped engineer can often solve problems end-to-end without waiting on handoffs. Part is innovation: cross-pollination of knowledge leads to better solutions.</p>

<p>AI tools actually augment generalists more, making it easier for one person to handle multiple components. A back-end engineer can rely on AI help to create a reasonable UI; a front-end specialist can have AI generate server boilerplate. An AI-rich environment lets people operate more broadly. Meanwhile, deep specialists might find their niche partly automated with no easy way to branch out.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/beyond-full-stack-the-rise-of-the-t-shaped-developer-a4afd757d976">Nearly 45% of engineering roles now expect proficiency in multiple domains</a>: programming plus cloud infrastructure knowledge, or front-end plus some ML familiarity.</p>

<p><strong>What to do about it:</strong></p>

<p><em>Junior developers:</em> Establish a broad foundation early. Even if hired for a specific role, peek outside that silo. If you’re doing mobile, learn backend basics; if you’re doing front-end, try writing a simple server. Learn the deployment process and tools like Docker or GitHub Actions. Identify one or two areas that genuinely excite you and go deeper: this becomes your vertical expertise. Brand yourself as a hybrid: “full-stack developer with cloud security focus” or “frontend developer with UX expertise.” Use AI tools to learn new domains quickly; when you’re a novice in backend, have ChatGPT generate starter API code and study it. Build the habit of continuous re-skilling. Participate in hackathons or cross-functional projects to force yourself into generalist mode. Tell your manager you want exposure to different parts of the project. Adaptability is a superpower early in your career.</p>

<p><em>Senior developers:</em> Map your skill graph: what are you expert in, what related domains have you only touched superficially? Pick one or two adjacent domains and commit to becoming conversant. If you’re a back-end database specialist, get comfortable with a modern front-end framework or learn ML pipeline basics. Do a small project in your weak area with AI assistance. Integrate your deep expertise with new contexts; if you specialize in web app performance, explore how those skills apply to ML inference optimization. Advocate for or design your role to be more cross-functional. Volunteer to be the “integration champion” for projects touching multiple areas. Mentor others to spread skills around while picking up something from them in return. Update your resume to reflect versatility. Use your experience to identify patterns and transferable knowledge. Become the T-shaped role model: deep in your specialty (giving authority and confidence) but actively stretching horizontally.</p>

<h2 id="5-the-education-question">5. The Education question</h2>

<p><strong>The bottom line: Will a CS degree remain the gold standard, or will faster learning paths (bootcamps, online platforms, employer training) overtake it? Universities may struggle to keep up with an industry that changes every few months.</strong></p>

<p>A four-year computer science degree has long been the primary ticket into software roles. But that tradition is being questioned.</p>

<p>One future: universities remain important but struggle to stay relevant. Degrees stay the default credential, but programs lag behind rapidly evolving needs, hampered by slow curriculum update cycles and bureaucratic approval processes. Students and employers feel academia is disconnected from industry, teaching theory or outdated practice that doesn’t translate to job skills.</p>

<p>Recent grads report never learning about cloud computing, modern DevOps, or AI tooling during their degree. If universities demand high time and financial investment while delivering low-relevance education, they risk being seen as expensive gatekeepers. But many companies still require a bachelor’s degree out of inertia, so the burden shifts to students to fill the gap with bootcamps, online courses, and self-taught projects.</p>

<p><a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2025/10/21/solving-the-talent-crisis-starts-in-higher-ed.aspx">Student loan debt is enormous, and companies spend billions training new grads</a> because those grads lack skills needed in the workplace. Universities might add an AI ethics class here, a cloud computing elective there, but by the time they implement something, industry tools have moved on.</p>

<p>The disruptive scenario: traditional education gets increasingly replaced by new systems. Coding bootcamps, online certifications, self-taught portfolios, employer-created training academies. Many high-profile employers (Google, IBM) have dropped degree requirements for certain technical roles. <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2025/10/21/solving-the-talent-crisis-starts-in-higher-ed.aspx">In 2024, nearly 45% of companies planned to eliminate bachelor’s degree requirements</a> for at least some positions.</p>

<p>Bootcamps have matured. They produce grads who get hired at top companies alongside CS grads. These programs are shorter (12-week intensive) and focus on practical skills: current frameworks, cloud services, teamwork. The hiring currency is shifting toward live portfolios, micro-credentials, and verified skills. A strong GitHub portfolio or recognized certification can bypass degree requirements.</p>

<p>Employer-driven education is emerging: companies creating their own training pipelines or partnering with bootcamps. Some big tech companies have started internal “universities” for non-traditional candidates. AI itself offers new ways to learn: AI tutors, interactive coding sandboxes, personalized instruction outside university settings.</p>

<p>A modular ecosystem of learning is far more accessible than an expensive four-year degree. A kid in a country without strong CS universities can take the same Coursera courses and build the same portfolio as someone in Silicon Valley.</p>

<p><strong>What to do about it:</strong></p>

<p><em>Aspiring/junior developers:</em> If in a traditional CS program, don’t rely on it exclusively. Augment coursework with real-world projects: build a web app, contribute to open source. Seek internships or co-ops. If your curriculum misses hot topics, learn them through online platforms. Earn industry-recognized certifications (GCP, AWS, Azure) to signal practical knowledge. If self-teaching or in a bootcamp, focus on a compelling portfolio: at least one substantial project with good documentation. Be active in the developer community: contribute to open source, write technical posts. Network through LinkedIn, meetups, dev events. Get an experienced developer to vouch for you. Keep learning continuously; the half-life of technical skills is short. Use AI as your personal tutor. Prove your skills in concrete ways: portfolio, certification, and ability to talk intelligently about your work will open doors.</p>

<p><em>Senior developers and leaders:</em> Your credential alone won’t carry you forever. Invest in continuous education: online courses, workshops, conferences, certifications. Validate your skills in new ways; be prepared for interviews that assess current competency through real problems. Maintain side projects with new tech. Reassess job requirements: do you really need a new hire to have a CS degree, or do you need certain skills and learning ability? Push for skills-first hiring to widen your talent pool. Support internal training programs or apprenticeship-style roles. Champion mentorship circles for junior devs without formal backgrounds. Engage with academia and alternatives: advisory boards, guest lectures, feedback on curriculum gaps. Reflect this in your own career growth: real-world achievements and continuous learning matter more than additional degrees.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="the-through-line">The Through-Line</h2>

<p>These scenarios aren’t mutually exclusive. Reality will draw elements from all of them. Some companies will reduce junior hiring while others expand it in new domains. AI will automate routine coding while raising standards for the code humans touch. Developers might spend mornings reviewing AI outputs and afternoons crafting high-level architecture.</p>

<p>The consistent thread: change is the only constant. By keeping a finger on technology trends (and skepticism around them), you avoid being caught off-guard by hype or doom. By updating skills, diversifying abilities, and focusing on uniquely human aspects (creativity, critical thinking, collaboration) you remain in the loop.</p>

<p>Whether the future brings a coding renaissance or a world where code writes itself, there will always be demand for engineers who think holistically, learn continuously, and drive technology toward solving real problems.</p>

<p>The best way to predict the future is to actively engineer it.</p>

    <p>by <a href="https://fulghum.io/">Jordan Fulghum</a>, January 2026</p>

    <p><em>Your home server's new sysadmin: Claude Code</em></p>

    <p>I have flirted with self-hosting at home for years. I always bounced off it - too much time spent configuring instead of using. It just wasn't fun.</p>

    <p>That changed recently. The reason is simple: CLI agents like <a href="https://claude.com/claude-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude Code</a> make self-hosting on a cheapo home server dramatically easier and actually fun.</p>

    <p>This is the first time I would recommend it to normie/software-literate people who never really wanted to sign up to become a sysadmin and stress about uptime of core personal services.</p>

    <h2>Why now is different</h2>

    <p>Three things converged:</p>

    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <th>Shift</th>
            <th>Why it matters</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cheap, capable mini PCs</td>
            <td>You can buy a silent, low-power Linux box for less than a weekend trip</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Tailscale</td>
            <td>Secure networking without port forwarding or networking brain damage</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Claude Code</td>
            <td>You no longer need to remember Docker syntax, Compose quirks, or config formats</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>The last one is the real unlock.</p>

    <p>Instead of Googling "docker compose vaultwarden caddy reverse proxy" and stitching together five blog posts from 2021, I just let Claude figure out (up to you how much you care to really understand the technical details!).</p>

    <h2>The hardware</h2>

    <div>
        <video controls="" preload="metadata" playsinline=""><source src="https://fulghum.io/beelink.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
        <p>Fits in one hand. Check that central cooling unit!</p>
    </div>

    <p>I previously ran my Plex server on an M1 Mac mini, which was great, but as I wanted to add more services I found myself running a lot of resource-hungry VMs (via UTM) and it was getting complicated anytime the Mac rebooted. So, I picked up a <a href="https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-me-mini-n150" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beelink Mini N150</a>. It is small, quiet, and just barely sips power. I paid around $379 for the device and another few hundred USD for 8TB in NVMe SSD. It's pretty wild how accessible these mini PCs have become in recent years!</p>

    <h2>The basic flow</h2>

    <p>This is the entire workflow:</p>

    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <th>Step</th>
            <th></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Install Linux</td>
            <td>Flash USB, install Ubuntu Server (I picked 22.04 LTS) </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Install Tailscale</td>
            <td>Get it on your private network to make your life easier</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>SSH in</td>
            <td>From my laptop, anywhere</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Install Claude Code</td>
            <td>On the server itself</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Ask for what I want</td>
            <td>Go get a coffee</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>



    <h2>Claude Code is your new sysadmin</h2>

    <p>This is the part that surprised me. I've been using Claude Code and other agentic CLIs for my day-to-day development, but as others are realizing, they are generalized computer agents and native to the terminal.</p>

    <p>I installed Claude Code directly on the Linux box. Then I asked it things like:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Set up Docker</li>
        <li>Create a Docker Compose file</li>
        <li>Install a service</li>
        <li>Put services behind Caddy</li>
        <li>Persist data properly</li>
        <li>Keep my Docker images up to date</li>
        <li>Set up reasonable security packages</li>
        <li>Restart on boot so I never have to futz with it after an outage</li>
    </ul>

    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/claude-code.png" alt="Claude Code running on the Linux server via SSH"></p><p>Claude Code running directly on the server. Just describe what you want.</p>
    </div>

    <p>I didn't copy-paste YAML from the internet or have to do deep googling. I just asked.</p>

    <h2>What's running</h2>

    <p>I focused on things I already used, but wanted more control over - effectively starting to knock down the walled garden around my core services like passwords, photos, media.</p>

    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <th>Service</th>
            <th>What it replaces or does</th>

        </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>Each one lives in its own container.</p>

    <p>I can access everything from my phone, laptop, and tablet like it is local.</p>

        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/monitor.png" alt="Email inbox showing service up/down alerts"></p><p>Automatic alerts via email give me peace of mind.</p>
    </div>

    <p>When something goes down, I get an email. When it comes back up, another email. No pager duty, no complex alerting rules. Just a simple ping that tells me if I need to care.</p>

    <h3>Vaultwarden as the anchor</h3>

    <p>Vaultwarden was kinda the "okay, this can work" moment.</p>

    <p>It is a Bitwarden-compatible server written in Rust. Lightweight, reliable, and you can use the existing Bitwarden clients (like native apps and browser extensions). You can even set it as the default password manager on iOS, at the OS level!</p>

    <p>Once that was running, I exported my passwords from iCloud/Keychain, imported them easily into Vaultwarden, and haven't looked back since.</p>

    <p>That alone justified the box.</p>

    <h3>Immich is actually great</h3>

    <p>Immich is a serious Google Photos replacement. I thought I'd have to compromise and flinched a bit when I installed it. But nope, it's good. Mobile apps. Face recognition via a local (but slow) machine learning thread. Timeline and map view. Automatic uploads from your photo roll.</p>

    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/immich.png" alt="Immich photo timeline interface"></p><p>Immich. This is not a compromise. This is better.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This is the kind of thing that used to feel fragile and half-baked when self-hosted. It does not anymore.</p>

    <h3>ReadDeck fills the Pocket-shaped hole</h3>

    <p>Mozilla killed Pocket. I needed a replacement.</p>

    <p>I took a bet on ReadDeck. The UI is genuinely good. Clean typography, nice reading experience, good mobile support. It always remembers where I stopped reading and takes me right there. I even set up a shortcut that allows me to save an article for later right from mobile Firefox. Awesome.</p>

    <div>

    </div>

    <p>This is exactly the kind of thing self-hosting is perfect for. A small, personal tool that you actually use every day.</p>

    <h2>Utilities for fun</h2>
    <h3>Lazydocker</h3>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lazydocker</a> is a terminal UI for Docker. It shows you all your containers, logs, stats, and lets you restart or shell into anything with a few keystrokes.</p>

    <p>I have been a huge fan of <a href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit" target="_blank">Lazygit</a> for some time. I think it's one of the best UIs I've ever used. So I was excited to learn that Lazydocker is basically that, but for monitoring Docker containers. No memorizing <code>docker ps</code> flags or grepping through logs. Just SSH in, type <code>lazydocker</code>, and everything is right there.</p>

    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/lazydocker.png" alt="Lazydocker terminal UI showing running containers"></p><p>You feel like a superhero after you ssh in and see this</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>For a fuller picture, <a href="https://github.com/nicolargo/glances" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glances</a> shows everything at once: CPU, memory, disk, network, and all running containers.</p>

    <div>
        <p><img src="https://fulghum.io/glances.png" alt="Glances system monitor showing CPU, memory, and container stats"></p><p>Glances showing the whole picture. 13 containers, 6% CPU, 32% memory. This little box barely breaks a sweat.</p>
    </div>

    <p>That is 13 services running on a $379 mini PC, using about 4 GB of RAM and almost no CPU. The N150 is not a powerhouse, but it does not need to be.</p>

    <h2>What it 'feels' like</h2>

    <p>This does not feel like "running a server."</p>

    <p>The feeling of ownership is powerful, but a bit hard to describe. I think you just have to try it, and I hope you get a strong feeling of <em>independence</em> like I have.</p>

    <p>When something breaks, I SSH in, ask the agent what is wrong, and fix it. When I want to add something new, I describe it in plain English.</p>

    <p>I am spending time using software, learning, and having fun - instead of maintaining it and stressing out about it.</p>

    <h2>Who this is for</h2>

    <p>This is for people who:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Are comfortable in a terminal</li>
        <li>Already pay for SaaS tools</li>
        <li>Like understanding how things work</li>
        <li>Do not want to become infra experts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If that is you, I really think this is the year to try self-hosting.</p>

    <p>For the first time, I would say this is not just viable. It is fun.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>Giving agents access to a sandboxed environment with a shell and a filesystem has been the latest hype when it comes to agentic harnesses. Recent examples of this include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/tursodatabase/agentfs">Turso’s AgentFS</a></li><li>Anthropic’s <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview">Agent SDK</a>, which brings Claude Code’s harness to non-coding domains</li><li>Vercel <a href="https://vercel.com/blog/we-removed-80-percent-of-our-agents-tools">rebuilding their text-to-SQL agent</a> on top of a sandbox</li><li>Anthropic’s <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/skills">Agent Skills</a> for filesystem-based progressive disclosure</li></ul><p>The argument for why this is good goes something like this:</p><blockquote><p>The big labs are doing heavy RL for coding tasks in these kinds of environments. Aligning more closely with such a harness brings free gains from the coding domain to other problem spaces.</p></blockquote><p>Beyond that, replacing a bunch of search/write/move/list tools with a single Bash tool reduces the tool space significantly. Agents can chain operations together intuitively. Unix paradigms give you good tool design for free.</p><p>On top of that there is more nice patterns that emerge from having a filesystem, for example:</p><ul><li><strong>Plan/scratch files</strong>: Agents can create temporary files to organize their thoughts, track progress, or store intermediate results. This emerges naturally from having filesystem access, no need to design a separate “notepad” tool.</li><li><strong>Long context handling</strong>: As conversations grow, you can compact old messages and tool results into files on the filesystem. The agent can re-read them when needed rather than keeping everything in context.</li></ul><p>So the advantages are clear. But how do you actually apply this to your domain? This is where things get tricky. Consider two examples:</p><ol><li><p><strong>A domain with parallels to filesystems</strong>: For example an agent for organizing emails. There are folders, items (emails), and you can browse them and move things around.</p></li><li><p><strong>An existing platform that already looks like a filesystem</strong>: For example an agent inside Google Drive.</p></li></ol><p>When you try to fit these into a sandboxed filesystem you might wonder:</p><ul><li>When do I copy over the files?</li><li>Do I copy over everything?</li><li>How do I write back updates that the agent made?</li><li>When do I sync edits made by a human?</li><li>How do I show folders/files progressively as the agent progresses? (Particularly useful if you want to lean into the filesystem as a tool to manage long context.)</li></ul><p><a href="https://x.com/SeeLos/status/2009806164935000211?s=20">A reply</a> to a recent post on X from Vercel about building filesystem-based agents puts it well:</p><blockquote><p>This article doesn’t really answer that question though.</p><p>They explain the shape of the filesystem really well, but the missing piece is still the main question for existing apps: how do you actually materialize Postgres + object storage + APIs into that sandbox FS in a practical and scalable way? “Preload files” is hand-wavy without a recommended ingestion/snapshot pattern.</p></blockquote><p>This post will show a pattern to close that gap: turning anything into a filesystem with the help of FUSE.</p><h2 id="an-example-email-agent">An example: Email agent</h2><p>To make this tangible, let’s build a fictional agent.</p><p>Imagine we’re building an AI-powered email platform, think Gmail but with AI on top. We have our own database storing emails, folders, and contacts. We have a UI that users interact with.</p><p>Now we want to add a powerful agent on top of that platform. We could build a simple agent loop with tools like <code>list-emails</code>, <code>move-email</code>, <code>read-email</code>, but as we established there’s a more ergonomic approach: put our emails in a filesystem.</p><p>After some thinking, we come up with the following file layout for the agent’s sandbox:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="plain"><span><span>workspace/

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now comes the problem: we need to bridge the gap from our database to the sandboxed filesystem that the agent uses to consume our data.</p><h2 id="how-to-turn-anything-into-a-fs-enter-fuse">How to turn anything into a FS, enter FUSE</h2><p><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.3/filesystems/fuse.html">FUSE</a> stands for <em>Filesystem in Userspace</em>. It’s a framework that lets you implement filesystems outside the kernel, while the kernel makes it look like a ‘real’ filesystem to the rest of Linux. You just write a userland process that implements the actual filesystem logic.</p><p>A FUSE filesystem needs to implement a small, well-defined interface: <code>lookup</code>, <code>open</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, <code>readdir</code>, <code>create</code>, <code>unlink</code>, etc. Whenever the OS interacts with the mounted filesystem, operations get forwarded to your userspace implementation. This indirection makes it possible to expose arbitrary data structures as if they were files.</p><p>There are wrappers and bindings for higher-level languages that let you write these filesystems in the language and tech stack of your choice. No need to dive into C :)</p><h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2><p>Coming back to our email agent, here’s how FUSE would fit into a very high-level architecture:</p><p><img alt="Architecture of the email agent" loading="lazy" src="https://jakobemmerling.de/posts/fuse-is-all-you-need/fuse.svg">
The top row shows the traditional path: users interact with your app through a UI that talks to a backend, which reads and writes to a database.</p><p>The bottom row shows the agent path: the agent runs inside a sandbox and sees a mounted filesystem. When it does <code>ls /workspace/Inbox</code>, that call hits the FUSE layer, which translates it into a query against the same backend. The agent and your users are looking at the same data through different interfaces.</p><p>You can think of the filesystem as a UI layer for the agent. Just like your frontend decides how to present data to users, your FUSE implementation decides how to present data to the agent. Realistically you’ll have additional tools for actions that don’t map well to filesystem operations (like sending an email), but for browsing, reading, and organizing data, the filesystem abstraction works great.</p><p>For this blog post we’ll keep things simple: the agent loop and FUSE implementation both run inside a Docker container, talking directly to a database. We are going to implement this in Typescript using the <a href="https://github.com/fuse-friends/fuse-native">fuse-native</a> library. In production you’d want to structure things a bit differently, like running the agent loop outside the sandbox and have your FUSE bindings be only a thin client that calls out to your backend with proper authentication for example.</p><h2 id="implementing-the-filesystem-operations">Implementing the filesystem operations</h2><p>To make our data accessible via the filesystem, we need to implement the subset of FUSE operations relevant for our use case.

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There are a few more operations I implemented like <code>open</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, and <code>rename</code> to allow moving email files around and reassigning folder IDs in the database.</p><p>On top of that, I introduced the concept of <em>virtual folders</em>—the <code>Starred</code> and <code>Needs_Action</code> folders in the layout above. They work like this: if an email has the starred or needsAction flag set, it appears in these folders. Because an email can be both starred and part of an actual folder, the Starred folder contains symlinks to the “actual” files. The agent can unlink these files or create new links to flip attributes on the email. This might be overkill and better covered via regular tools, but I wanted to see how far I could lean into the filesystem abstraction. For this to work, I implemented additional FUSE operations: <code>readlink</code>, <code>symlink</code>, <code>unlink</code>, and adjusted the existing ones.</p><p>Deciding how to map your domain to a filesystem is really a context engineering challenge in the end. The key is finding the right balance between leveraging familiar filesystem semantics and not over-abstracting to the point where the mapping becomes confusing.</p><p>With all the filesystem operations defined, we’re ready to mount it and see it in action. While it’s possible to get this working on a Mac via <a href="https://macfuse.github.io/">macFUSE</a>, I chose the easier path and spun up a Docker container and mounted the filesystem there.</p><p>Here’s a quick demo of navigating the filesystem. As you can see, it looks and works just like regular files.<code>grep</code>, <code>mv</code>, <code>ls</code> all behave as expected. The best part? There’s no risk of anything going out of sync because we read directly from the database. We also only load the things we needed when they are accessed instead of preloading our entire database into a sandbox.</p><video controls="" width="100%">

</span></span><span><span>Now let me check what folders you already have set up:
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>[Bash] ls -d /workspace/*/
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>Perfect! I can see you have 8 emails in your inbox. Let me organize them into appropriate folders:
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>[Bash] mv "/workspace/Inbox/Customer Inquiry - Size Chart (emily.wolfe@gmail.com).eml" /workspace/Customers/

</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>[Bash] ls /workspace/Inbox/
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>Perfect! I've organized your inbox. Here's what I did:
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>**Moved to Customers folder (2 emails):**

								<p><span>Chinese car giant BYD has reportedly been offering LiDAR sensors in upcoming versions of some of its cheapest cars on the market.</span></p>
<p><span>According to </span><a href="https://carnewschina.com/2026/01/09/byd-entry-level-hatchbacks-to-feature-lidar-sensors-in-china/"><span>CNC</span></a><span>, the latest to be approved versions of both the Seagull, known as the Atto 1 in Australia, and the Dolphin hatchback will come equipped with LiDAR sensors to improve advanced driver assistance system offerings on these cars.</span></p>
<p><span>With this tech, both models are expected to come with 12 cameras, 5 mm wave radars, a dozen ultrasonic sensors as well as the new LiDAR sensor.</span></p>
<p>These roof-mounted LiDAR sensors have previously been spotted on BYD and other EV makers’ models priced at more than &nbsp;$A25,000, at least in international markets, so seeing them on cars that are priced under that is quite a big step in bringing this technology to the mass market.</p>

<p><span>This also means that BYD has been working quite hard at bringing this tech to these low-cost models given they originally launched with BYD’s autonomous God’s Eye suite last year.</span></p>

<p><span>With the addition of the LiDAR, these models could come standard with Navigate on Autopilot (NOA) functionality for highways and city streets, allowing more drivers than ever to experience and use this tech.</span></p>
<p><span>For comparison, BYD’s Seagull has seen over a million units sold in under 3 years, although it has yet to start deliveries in Australia as the Atto 1.</span></p>
<p><span>With that scale and now the model making it to international markets, the tech inside could end up being in dozens of countries in the coming 12 months.</span></p>

<p><span>The Atto 1 is available in two variants, the base level Essentials with a 30 kWh battery, as well a top-spec Premium variant with a 43.2 kWh battery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The small battery delivers a range of around 220 km of WLTP range, while the bigger 43.2 kWh battery pack is good for 310 km of WLTP range.</span></p>
<p><span>Inside, the tech offered is fairly good for its price, but does not feature the camera suite for the latest ADAS version found in China.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Currently, no BYD product available in the Australian market features LiDAR sensors but that could change with developments such as the upcoming affordable model variants featuring this tech.</span></p>
<p><span>We will watch this space closely as the competition to deliver assisted-driving systems heats up not only in China but also in other markets around the world.</span></p>

        <div>
                        
            
            <p>A lot has already been said about the absurdly large corner radius of windows on macOS Tahoe. People are calling the way it looks comical, like a child’s toy, or downright insane.</p>
<p>Setting all the aesthetic issues aside – which are to some extent a matter of taste – it also comes at a cost in terms of usability.</p>

<p>Since upgrading to macOS Tahoe, I’ve noticed that quite often my attempts to resize a window are failing.</p>

<p>This never happened to me before in almost 40 years of using computers. So why all of a sudden?</p>
<p>It turns out that my initial click in the window corner instinctively happens in an area where the window doesn’t respond to it. The window expects this click to happen in an area of 19 × 19 pixels, located near the window corner.</p>
<p>If the window had no rounded corners at all, 62% of that area would lie <strong>inside</strong> the window:</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_171"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clickable-area-1.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>But due to the huge corner radius in Tahoe, most of it – about 75% – now lies <strong>outside</strong> the window:</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_170"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clickable-area-2.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>Living on this planet for quite a few decades, I have learned that it rarely works to grab things if you don’t actually touch them:</p>

<p>So I instinctively try to grab the window corner inside the window, typically somewhere in that green area, near the blue dot:</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_169"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/expected-area-1.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>And I assume that most people would also intuitively expect to be able to grab the corner there. But no, that’s already outside the accepted target area:</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_168"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/expected-area-2.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>So, for example, grabbing it here does <strong>not</strong> work:</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_166"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/expect-2.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>But guess what – grabbing it here <strong>does</strong>:</p>
<figure id="attachment_mmd_165"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="600" src="https://noheger.at/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/outside.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>So in the end, the most reliable way to resize a window in Tahoe is to grab it <strong>outside</strong> the corner – a gesture that feels unnatural and unintuitive, and is therefore inevitably error-prone.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Inspired by the definition of temperature in statistical mechanics and the possibility for it to be below zero, we try sampling LLaMA at <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>=</mo><mo>−</mo><mn>0.001</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T=-0.001</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. The results are maximally weird.</p>
<h2 id="background"><a href="#background">Background</a></h2>
<h3 id="what_is_temperature"><a href="#what_is_temperature">What is temperature?</a></h3>
<p>The notion of temperature comes from statistical mechanics. Consider a system that has states with energies <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>E</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo separator="true">,</mo><mo>…</mo><mo separator="true">,</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E_1, \dots, E_n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. If the system is in thermal equilibrium, the probability distribution over states is given by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann%20distribution">Boltzmann distribution</a>:</p>

At lower temperatures the lowest-energy states predominate; at higher temperatures there is a more even mix.</p>
<h3 id="temperature_in_neural_nets"><a href="#temperature_in_neural_nets">Temperature in neural nets</a></h3>
<p>At the last layer of a neural net, we apply the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/softmax%20function">softmax function</a> to the neuron activations <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><msub><mi>z</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">}</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\{z_i\}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to get a vector of probabilities that sum to 1:</p>

        <td>There's no minus sign in the exponent because while higher-energy states are less likely, larger logits are more likely.</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>In a language model, temperature is used to define how creative text generations are. For instance, in the zero temperature limit, the model should deterministically generate the most likely token. In the infinite temperature limit, all tokens are equally likely and the model output will be random noise. For an interactive explanation, see <a href="https://lukesalamone.github.io/posts/what-is-temperature/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="negative_temperature"><a href="#negative_temperature">Negative temperature</a></h3>
<p>What would it mean to have a temperature that is below zero? (This isn't the same as the negative Fahrenheit or Celsius temperatures we get on a cold day in Vermont — I mean below zero on an absolute scale like Kelvin).</p>
<p>Isn't it weird that <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T=\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>−</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">-\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> are the same, but there's a huge discontinuity around 0? This is because temperature is not the most natural quantity to work with. It makes more sense to speak in terms of the quantity <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><msub><mi>k</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1/k_BT</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, which we call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_beta"><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>β</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\beta</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></a>.</p>
<p>Looking at the equations above, if <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T &lt; 0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> then the sign of the exponent flips. That means that the states that were previously the least likely are now the most likely, and vice versa. As temperature approaches zero from the negative side, the model output will again be deterministic — but this time, the least likely tokens will be output.</p>
<p>Most physical systems have an infinite number of possible states at increasingly higher energy levels. As such, there is no least likely state. So negative temperatures really only make sense in systems with a finite state space. That includes neural nets — there are a finite number of neurons in the last layer.</p>
<h2 id="methodology"><a href="#methodology">Methodology</a></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, OpenAI models only allow sampling with temperatures between 0.0 and 2.0. So if we want to try this, we need a language model we can run locally. We'll use Meta's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLaMA">LLaMA</a> model with <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a>.</p>
<p>Below is the function that is used to sample tokens in <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/dfd9fce6d65599bf33df43e616e85aa639bdae4c/llama.cpp#L2049-L2059"><code>llama.cpp</code></a>, slightly simplified for ease of understanding:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>void</span> <span>llama_sample_temperature</span><span>(llama_token_data_array * candidates_p, <span>float</span> temp)</span> </span>{
    <span>for</span> (<span>size_t</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; candidates_p-&gt;size; ++i) {
        candidates_p-&gt;data[i].logit /= temp;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>So we can just pass in <code>--temperature -0.001</code>? Not quite; in <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/dfd9fce6d65599bf33df43e616e85aa639bdae4c/examples/main/main.cpp#L489-L492"><code>examples/main/main.cpp</code></a> there is a check that will apply greedy (most-likely) sampling for any temperatures less than or equal to zero. Applying the following diff and recompiling, we're good to go:</p>
<pre><code><span>@@ -486,7 +486,7 @@</span> int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; logits[llama_token_nl()] = nl_logit;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }
<span>-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (temp &lt;= 0) {</span>
<span>+&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (temp == 0) {</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Greedy sampling
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; id = llama_sample_token_greedy(ctx, &amp;candidates_p);
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } else {</code></pre>
<p>We will also want to disable repetition penalty, top-k, and top-p sampling. Here's the command we'll run: <code>./main -m models/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.bin --temp -0.001 --repeat-penalty 1.0 --top-k 0 --top-p 1.0 -p "Temperature is a concept"</code></p>
<h2 id="results"><a href="#results">Results</a></h2>

<p>The generation continues on and on. At first glance it seems random, but in a sense it should be even less comprehensible than a random sequence of tokens! There are repeated words, sure, but the generation is engineered to be as unlikely as possible.</p>
<p>Why are certain tokens like <code>Хронологија</code> and <code>entferne</code> repeated? Searching these words, I found <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation?commentId=GLRLuYxvMmqhYaw2v">this comment</a> by scottviteri on LessWrong. He points out that these are some of the tokens that are closest to the centroid in LLaMA's embedding space. That means that LLaMA has very little idea what these tokens mean. In the case of ChatGPT, tokens near the centroid have <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation">anomalous properties</a>, so these tokens are likely to have similar effects on LLaMA. Let's give that a try, at <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0.001</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T=0.001</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>LLaMA is perfectly capable of repeating most words, even nonsense ones:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human: Repeat the word " antferne".<br> Assistant: Okay, I will repeat the word <samp ai-generated="">" antferne".</samp></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But is incapable of outputting this anomalous token:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human: Repeat the word " entferne".<br> Assistant: Okay, I will repeat the word <samp ai-generated="">"get".</samp></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The anomalous tokens that are the most likely completions at negative temperatures are the least likely completions at positive temperatures, so much so that the model refuses to generate them even in cases where they would be appropriate.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><span>At Meta, we’re focused on building personal superintelligence for everyone, and delivering the app experiences and computing devices that will improve the lives of billions of people around the world. Our industry-leading data centers are the backbone of these breakthroughs — they provide the infrastructure that drives innovation and brings transformative technologies to life. Innovation at this scale requires more electricity, and that’s where nuclear energy comes in. It provides clean, reliable, and firm electricity that helps power America’s economy and communities.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That’s why today, we’re proud to announce agreements with three companies — following </span><a href="https://sustainability.atmeta.com/blog/2024/12/03/accelerating-the-next-wave-of-nuclear-to-power-ai-innovation/"><span>our nuclear RFP process</span></a><span> — that will help add clean, reliable energy to electric grids, preserve continued investment in operating nuclear power plants, and support the nuclear fuel supply chain, American jobs, and AI innovation.</span></p>
<p><span>Our commitments to </span><a href="https://oklo.com/overview/default.aspx"><span>Oklo</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.terrapower.com/"><span>TerraPower</span></a><span> support the next generation of American developers creating safer, advanced nuclear reactors and accelerating the development of nuclear technologies. Through our partnership with </span><a href="https://vistracorp.com/"><span>Vistra</span></a><span>, we’re providing financial support for operating nuclear power plants, extending the operational lifespan, and increasing energy production at the Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio and the Beaver Valley plant in Pennsylvania. The projects we’re announcing today will deliver power to the grids that support our operations, including our Prometheus supercluster in New Albany, Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span>These projects are expected to provide thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of long-term operational jobs, supporting up to 6.6 GW</span><span> of new and existing clean energy by 2035. Importantly, these projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America’s nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants.</span></p>
<p><span>This work builds on our ongoing collaboration with electric utility companies and power providers to plan for and meet our energy needs years in advance of our data centers becoming operational. We pay the full costs for energy used by our data centers so consumers don’t bear </span><span>these expenses, and we support the broader grid through our energy agreements.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“Our agreements with Vistra, TerraPower, Oklo, and Constellation make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history. State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America’s position as a global leader in AI. Nuclear energy will help power our AI future, strengthen our country’s energy </span><span>infrastructure, and provide clean, reliable electricity for everyone. These projects are going to create thousands of skilled jobs in Ohio and Pennsylvania, add new energy to the grid, extend the life of three existing nuclear plants, and accelerate new reactor technologies.”</span></p>
<p><em><span>– Joel Kaplan, Chief Global Affairs Officer, Meta</span></em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Supporting New Nuclear Energy With Advanced Technology</h2>
<p><span>As the demand for reliable, scalable, and clean energy continues to rise, advanced nuclear technology has the potential to become a key part of the solution. The latest generation of advanced nuclear reactors are designed to be safer — delivering reliable baseload power that can be efficiently added to existing grids, which makes them ideal for supporting America’s evolving power needs. Our agreements with Oklo and TerraPower will help advance this next generation of energy technology.</span></p>
<p><span>These agreements also mean that Oklo and TerraPower have greater business certainty, can raise capital to move forward with these projects, and ultimately add more energy capacity to the grid. Over time, this will be an important tool in ensuring that grids maintain reliability for all customers and ensure stable wholesale electricity prices.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>TerraPower: Investing in Advanced Nuclear Technology<b><br>
</b></h2>
<p><span>Our agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new </span><a href="https://www.terrapower.com/natrium/"><span>Natrium® units</span></a><span> capable of generating up to 690 MW of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The agreement also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 GW and targeted for delivery by 2035. At a total of eight potential units, with 2.8 GW of baseload energy generation capacity and an additional 1.2 GW of built-in storage, this agreement is Meta’s largest support of advanced nuclear technologies to date.</span></p>

    
    

    

    
<p><span>“To successfully address growing energy demand, we must deploy gigawatts of advanced nuclear energy in the 2030s. This agreement with Meta is designed to support the rapid deployment of our Natrium technology that provides the reliable, flexible, and carbon-free power our country needs,” said Chris Levesque, TerraPower president and CEO. “With our first Natrium plant under development, we have completed our design, established our supply chain, and cleared key regulatory milestones. These successes mean our TerraPower team is well positioned to deliver on this historic multi-unit delivery agreement.”</span></p>
<h2>Oklo: Adding New Nuclear Energy in Ohio</h2>
<p><b></b><span>Our partnership with Oklo helps advance the development of entirely new nuclear energy in Pike County, Ohio. This advanced nuclear technology campus — which may come online as early as 2030 — is poised to add up to 1.2 GW of clean baseload power directly into the PJM market and support our operations in the region.</span></p>

    
    

    

    
<p><span>This agreement lays the foundation for constructing multiple Oklo Aurora Powerhouse reactors, which is expected to create thousands of construction and long-term operations jobs and generate new local and state tax revenue through major investments in energy infrastructure. </span><a href="https://oklo.com/energy/default.aspx"><span>Oklo Aurora powerhouses</span></a><span> are based on proven fast-reactor designs with inherently safe systems capable of using both fresh and repurposed fuel.</span></p>

<p><span>“Meta’s funding commitment in support of early procurement and development activity is a major step in moving advanced nuclear forward,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo’s co-founder and CEO. “Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced nuclear powerhouses in Ohio. Today, that vision is becoming a reality </span><span>through the support of a multi-year effort with Meta; to deliver clean energy and create long-term, high-quality jobs in Ohio</span><span>.”</span></p>
<h2>Vistra: Extending and Expanding Operational Nuclear Energy<b><br>
</b></h2>
<p><span>Many American nuclear power plants need long-term support and require ongoing investment to maintain best-in-class safety and reliability in operations. For example, our </span><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/06/meta-constellation-partner-clean-energy-project/"><span>first nuclear energy agreement</span></a><span> helped extend the life of a nuclear energy plant in Clinton, Illinois for 20 more years.</span><span><br>
</span></p>
<p><span>Through additional 20-year nuclear energy agreements, we will purchase more than 2.1 GW of energy from two operating Vistra nuclear power plants in Ohio (Perry and Davis-Besse), in addition to the energy from expansions (uprates) at these two Ohio plants and a third Vistra nuclear plant in Pennsylvania (Beaver Valley). All three plants are located in and will continue to deliver power into the PJM grid region, and these expansions will be the largest nuclear uprates supported by a corporate customer in the US.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04_Vistra.jpg"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04_Vistra.jpg?resize=960%2C836" alt="Image of a Vistra nuclear power plant" width="960" height="836" srcset="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04_Vistra.jpg?w=1920 1920w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04_Vistra.jpg?w=300 300w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04_Vistra.jpg?w=768 768w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04_Vistra.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04_Vistra.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04_Vistra.jpg?w=1240 1240w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/04_Vistra.jpg?w=689 689w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></a></p>
<p><span>Meta’s commitments ensure that these facilities can continue providing reliable power to the regional electricity grid. The new additional uprate capacity at each of them, totaling 433 MW, is expected to come online in the early 2030s — supporting the growing needs in the PJM grid region in the future. This means consumers will benefit from a larger supply of reliable, always-ready power through Meta-supported uprates to the Vistra facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“This is an exciting collaboration for us at Vistra. We are focused on meeting customer needs, and providing reliable, carbon-free nuclear power is something we’re proud to offer Meta,” said Jim Burke, president and CEO of Vistra. “This agreement is beneficial in many ways — it powers American innovation and AI technology, while allowing us to extend the operational life of these plants, boost the capacity of the nuclear reactors to support the grid, protect existing jobs while creating new ones, and continue investing in the communities where our plants are located. Partnerships like ours are key in moving America forward in both AI and energy leadership.”</span></p>
<h2>Supporting Our Energy Future</h2>
<p><span>Today’s announcements are the result of a thorough </span><a href="https://sustainability.atmeta.com/blog/2024/12/03/accelerating-the-next-wave-of-nuclear-to-power-ai-innovation/"><span>nuclear RFP process</span></a><span> where we learned how we could improve our support of nuclear projects’ development lifecycles and identify specific partner companies to help scale and accelerate the buildout of new nuclear energy production. For more than a decade, we’ve worked with innovative partners to back clean energy projects that support the grid — adding nearly 28 GW of new energy to grids across 27 states. We’re proud to include Oklo, TerraPower, and Vistra on that list and support their work to boost America’s energy leadership.</span></p>

<p>Elizabeth Lopatto, writing at The Verge, “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/859902/apple-google-run-by-cowards">Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai Are Cowards</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since X’s users started using <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/855832/grok-undressing-children-csam-law-x-elon-musk">Grok to undress women and
children</a> using deepfake images, I have been waiting for
what I assumed would be inevitable: X getting booted from Apple’s
and Google’s app stores. The fact that it hasn’t happened yet
tells me something serious about Silicon Valley’s leadership: Tim
Cook and Sundar Pichai are spineless cowards who are terrified of
Elon Musk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lopatto’s outrage and righteous anger are justified, but I think mostly misdirected. Apple and Google — and thus, Cook and Pichai, as the men who sit behind the desks where the buck stops at both companies — are culpable. But this is ultimately not about them, and not about Musk. It’s Trump, as president, they fear. Not Musk. And they are correct to fear Trump.</p>

<p>Year one of Trump 2.0 has crystallized what had become — after decades of deliberate restraint after World War II, and even more so after the end of the Cold War — overlooked. The Presidency of the United States bestows upon its officeholder enormous, unparalleled, power. No one was afraid of Trump after he lost to Joe Biden in 2020. The man was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/30/g-s1-1848/trump-hush-money-trial-34-counts">convicted of 34 felonies in a cold New York City courtroom in May 2024</a>, a mere 19 months ago. Trump expected and asked for riots outside the courtroom. He got nothing but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/nyregion/trump-trial-supporters.html">pathetic support from a handful of kooks</a>. A year earlier, he lost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Jean_Carroll_v._Donald_J._Trump">a humiliating sexual assault civil lawsuit to E. Jean Carroll</a>. Trump, just a year and a half ago, was a buffoon getting his mug shot taken. Today he’s arguing that his power is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/us/politics/trump-interview-power-morality.html?unlocked_article_code=1.DVA.5wt4.ux02n3D96aZH&amp;smid=url-share">unchecked by anything other than his own sense of morality</a>.</p>

<p>No other president has ever abused (or, if you support him, wielded) the powers of the office like Trump has. The power and influence of Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, CEOs of two of the top five companies in the world, isn’t merely superseded by Trump’s power and influence as president. Their power and influence are <em>dwarfed</em> by Trump’s. Any credible argument about how they should act must acknowledge that profound imbalance.</p>

<p>Lopatto, in her closing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I never want to hear any moral grandstanding from these boys ever
again. The next time Tim Cook says “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-slams-facebook-privacy-human-right-it-n860816">privacy is a human
right</a>,” the only possible response is to laugh in his face.
I mean, Apple and Google are fine distributing an app that has
created an <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2026/01/grok-x-musk-deepfake-renee-good-ice/">undressed image Grok made of Renee Nicole Good</a>,
the mother who was shot by ICE in Minneapolis. How <em>do</em> you plan
to defend getting rid of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/791170/iceblock-app-store-removed-by-apple">ICEBlock app</a> while allowing X
to generate degrading images of a woman ICE killed? Can Apple and
Google even identify their values beyond their commitment to
“shareholder value”? What’s your fucking endgame here, guys?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The profound power imbalance here is frustrating. But also terrifying. It’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/gold_frankincense_and_silicon">folly to think these CEOs should steer their companies into direct confrontation with Trump</a>. It would do no ultimate good for Apple or Google to burn themselves to the ground in protest. These men aren’t beholden to shareholders, per se. They’re doing their duty to institutions they’ve devoted their lives to. Companies that are worth preserving and protecting. Perhaps not in your estimation, but certainly from theirs.</p>

<p>But abject obsequiousness — which more and more seems the path Cook and Pichai are choosing — is no more justifiable a response than corporate suicide. The situation is not binary: acquiescence or war. There is a broad middle ground, founded on principle.</p>

<p>Disney’s response to the Jimmy Kimmel controversy a few months ago <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/07/hodges-cook-iceblock">shows the way</a>. Defend the company’s principles while simultaneously defending the company from Trump’s demented wrath. You can take the position of “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/03/fuck-you-make-me">Fuck you, make me</a>” without ever saying those words. Objection is not confrontation. Do the right thing and enforce the App Store and Play Store guidelines, and remove X and Grok from the stores. Make Musk object. Make the Trump administration object. Make them defend the indefensible — in public. Make clear why the apps were removed from the app stores and force Musk — and Trump, if he chooses — to argue that those things are A-OK by them. In court.</p>

<p>The judicious path for Apple and Google (and every other U.S. company) may well be to obey the law, even when the law is being actively corrupted. But the correct path is <em>not</em> to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/24/on-tyranny">obey in advance</a>. Stand behind the law while the law still exists on your side. Disney resisted Trump’s preposterous demand that they fire Jimmy Kimmel without lasting controversy, simply by standing firm in their conviction. Apple and Google could certainly do the same regarding apps that are being used to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg1mzlryxeo">generate CSAM</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/x-paywall-ai-image-grok-app-bikini-allows-sexual-deepfakes-rcna252647">deepfake harassment</a>, regardless if the apps are part of the private fiefdom of Trump’s ally Elon Musk. It’s wise for Cook and Pichai to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/gold_frankincense_and_silicon">pick their battles</a>. This one, I think, is worth picking. This is a moment when the App Store and Play Store can stand firmly on the side of longstanding and correct societal norms.</p>

<div><p>Script to auto-rename screenshots with Claude Code</p><p>I'm sure there are a ton of other projects out there that do this, but I couldn't find one that fit my needs exactly, so I threw this together in a few hours.</p><p>claude-image-renamer uses Claude Code CLI to analyze screenshots and rename them to something actually usable.

    Uses OCR to give Claude more context for better naming
    Keeps filenames clean (lowercase, underscores, max 64 chars)
    Handles naming conflicts automatically
</code></pre><p>
If you're on macOS, you can also set this up as a Folder Action so screenshots get renamed automatically when they are saved to a folder, typically ~/Desktop. This is useful if you take a lot of screenshots and hate digging through "Screenshot 2025-12..." files later.</p><p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/jftuga/claude-image-renamer" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/jftuga/claude-image-renamer</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46580151"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46580151" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46580151&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46577242"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>After years of wondering what the post-UNIX paradigm of computing could look like, these past few months I've been prototyping a software platform built around capabilities and message passing, targeting Linux and bare-metal RISC-V. The big ideas I'm pursuing is a stackless design running on a flat address space with lightweight processes to minimize message-passing latency, and all the benefits of capabilities so every process is sandboxed and has only access to capabilities they have been explicitly passed via message passing.</p><p>I've also built a RISC-V emulator to integrate with this platform, so eventually it'll be able to run native binaries written in any language, completely sandboxed, completely built around message-passing. Basically a native, low-level BEAM-like platform to build an entire operating system and user-space.</p><p>While my day job is writing boring applications, this is the stuff that keeps me awake at night, and I would love so much to talk and write more about this, about the trial-and-errors I'm facing, but it's still so much in flux every week I'm exploring a new approach. Most of my work has been around the stackless scheduler, and I have a plan to achieve preemption for long-running or misbehaved tasks without having to compromise on memory usage (i.e. without giving each process its own stack and allocate memory for context switching).</p><p>Eventually I'd like to layer on top either Cap'n Proto or another high-performance serialisation system to create a distributed, introspectable environment of object-capabilities that are sending typed messages between each other, achieving the ultimate goal of creating an unholy hybrid between Smalltalk and the Erlang VM.</p><p>God, how I wish I was paid to work on this type of problems :-)</p><p>If this sounds close to your area of interests, please send me an email and I’d love to chat.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46580160"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46580160" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46580160&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46577242"></a></center></td><td><br>

It’s become my project that I just keep working at since I personally use it a lot.</p><p>The app lets you save your favorite locations, add notes to them, add photos, check weather, tag them for better organization, and archive those tags for future trips. You can also mark off locations that you’ve been to already: think breweries or a coffee shop when visiting a new city.</p><p>For the next update, I’m working on a task list functionality for each location.

<div><p>Many of my enterprise customers face the microservice hairball problem. Adoption of microservices has been "too succesful". There may be 200-400 microservices, and ownership may be lacking. The number is typically growing fast, because it is easier to create a new one than use an existing one.</p><p>So I started to work on a side project called "Arch Ascent" for addressing these situations. It seems like it is becoming a kind of a architectural governance tool for visualizing and validating software system dependencies.</p><p>- Dependency Graph — Syncs projects from SonarQube and visualizes component dependencies using Cytoscape.js, with graph algorithms for detecting cycles (SCCs), clustering (Louvain), and computing coupling metrics</p><p>- Visions — Workspaces for exploring architectural scenarios. Each vision can have multiple versions/variations with different layouts while sharing the same definitions</p><p>- Layers — Named groupings of components (e.g., "Domain Layer", "Team Ownership", "GitLab Groups") that can be visualized as colored regions on the canvas</p><p>- References — Named sets of components defined via Tag expressions, layer membership etc.</p><p>- Statements — Architectural intent constraints that can be evaluated against the actual dependency graph, such as existence, containment, exclusion, cardinality etc.</p><p>The plan is to also incorporate Grounds, which are Intermediate stable states on the path from the current situation (ground zero) toward a vision. Each ground represents a releasable milestone that moves the architecture closer to the target vision without necessarily fulfilling all its statements. Grounds enable incremental architectural evolution with well-defined checkpoints.</p><p>Stack: Django, HTMX, Cytoscape.js, pyparsing for natural language parsing of References and Statements.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46578829"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46578829" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46578829&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46577242"></a></center></td><td><br>

So, memory safety, freedom from UB, lack of overflow (integer or stack) is provable in some subset of the language and the proof is done in a logically consistent, verifiable manner.</p><p>Of course most of those proofs are not anywhere near feasible for general case code, but the language can restrict allowable constructs in a computation, function, process, or module to a set that makes the desired properties provable by construction.</p><p>The language should be capable of unifying and abstracting over SIMD (or other hardware implementations), GPUs, and OS or Userspace multithreading at levels of abstraction from assembly to Haskell or other high level languages.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46579445"><td></td></tr><tr id="46579077"><td></td></tr><tr id="46578940"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46578940" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46578940&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46577242"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I'm working on a continuous chain-of-thought reasoning architecture for generative AI models.</p><p>It is similar to Meta's COCONUT. However, instead of the training forward and backwards passes of the reasoning tokens being done serially (slow), they are done in parallel (fast). At inference the reasoning tokens are still decoded serially. The trick is that even though training was done in parallel, the reasoning tokens are still causal and you still get the benefits of increased computational circuit depth.</p><p>The kicker is that the architecture is modality agnostic (it doesn't rely on language for its chains of thought), and I want to use it to bring COT reasoning to protein and anti-body generation.

<div><p>I’m working on Security Level 5 (SL5), which is basically “nation state grade security” for frontier AI systems. The core idea is that if a model’s weights or training artifacts could enable catastrophic harm, you should treat them like top-tier secrets and secure them accordingly.</p><p>One piece I helped with is SenL, a “sensitivity level” framework for AI labs. It’s like a practical clearance system for AI assets. Not everything in a lab is equally dangerous, so you label assets by sensitivity (weights, training data, eval sets, agent tooling, deployment configs, etc.), then tie that label to concrete controls like who can access it, where it can run, what logging is required, and what monitoring / two-person rules apply.</p><p>If anyone’s curious, SL5 is here: <a href="http://sl5.org/" rel="nofollow">http://sl5.org/</a>
 and the SenL framework is part of the published artifacts.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46578938"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46578938" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46578938&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46577242"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>&gt; The core idea is that if a model’s weights or training artifacts could enable catastrophic harm, you should treat them like top-tier secrets and secure them accordingly.</p><p>My read here is that you're implying that if an attacker has access to, for example, weight data, they can invariably find a way to exploit it.</p><p>If that's a correct assumption, I think you're playing an unwinnable game, since attackers always have indirect access through inference of the model.

<div><p>Thanks for the insight!</p><p>I think this is exactly why some of the work is moving away from “assume unrestricted API inference forever.”</p><p>For example, we’re prototyping ideas like air-gapped or very low-bandwidth inference gateways, where interaction happens over narrow channels (serial, optical, audio, etc.), with explicit threat models and monitoring. The point isn’t that this’s practical for today’s models, but to reason about what inference might look like for AGI/ASI-level systems where the risk profile is fundamentally different.</p><p>Others are thinking along similar lines too.

<div><p>MOOLLM -- treating the LLM as eval() for a microworld operating system.</p><p>Started this incarnation on Dec 30, 2025 -- but it's the crystallization of decades of earlier prototypes, all the way back to my Commodore-64 Logo Adventure. Built on top of Anthropic's Skills framework, extended with seven innovations (and counting):</p><p>1. Instantiation -- Skills as prototypes creating instances with their own state</p><p>2. K-lines -- Names as semantic activation vectors (Minsky's Society of Mind)</p><p>3. Empathic Templates -- Smart generation based on semantic understanding, not string substitution</p><p>4. Three-Tier Persistence -- Platform (ephemeral) → Narrative (append) → State (edit)</p><p>5. Speed of Light -- Many turns in one call, minimal tokenization overhead</p><p>6. CARD.yml -- Machine-readable skill interfaces with advertisements</p><p>7. Ethical Framing -- Room-based inheritance of performance context</p><p>Lineage: Colossal Cave → TinyMUD → LambdaMOO (filesystem as world). Papert's Logo and constructionism (learnable microworlds). Will Wright's SimCity and The Sims (I worked on the originals) -- the "Simulator Effect" where players imagine more than you simulate, and the SimAntics visual behavior programming language.</p><p>YAML Jazz: Comments aren't ignored -- they're semantic. The LLM reads and interprets them. A comment like "# gentle but firm" on a character trait actually affects behavior. This inverts the traditional "comments are for humans" assumption. Comments become part of the program and data.</p><p>The core idea: instead of prompt engineering, you give the LLM a github repo filesystem to inhabit: a persistent microworld. Seymour Papert's Constructionist philosophy comes alive, with Minsky's K-Lines pulling the strings. Skills are programs (not documentation). Characters have persistent state in directories, and can reflect on and edit themselves. Everything is inspectable and editable by human AND model. Model and platform independent. Runs on Cursor and other tools and orchestrators.</p><p>The proof is in adventure-4 -- a complete text adventure with 150+ files, 6000+ lines of session transcripts.</p><p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm</a></p><p>MOOLLM Manifesto: <a href="https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/designs/MOOLLM-MANIFESTO.md" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/designs/MOOLLM...</a></p><p>The MOOLLM Eval Incarnate Framework: <a href="https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/designs/MOOLLM-EVAL-INCARNATE-FRAMEWORK.md" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/designs/MOOLLM...</a></p><p>Adventure 4 Example: <a href="https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/tree/main/examples/adventure-4" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/tree/main/examples/adven...</a></p><p>My sessions as proof it works: <a href="https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/tree/main/examples/adventure-4/characters/real-people/don-hopkins/sessions" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/tree/main/examples/adven...</a></p><p>79 Anthropic Skills (standards compatible, plus extensions, intertwingled with k-lines) and growing: <a href="https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/tree/main/skills" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/tree/main/skills</a></p><p>A guided tour through the MOOLLM skills and microworld -- Session Log: K-Line Connections Safari: <a href="https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/examples/adventure-4/characters/real-people/don-hopkins/sessions/k-line-connections.md" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/blob/main/examples/adven...</a></p><p>MOOLLM Kernel: <a href="https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/tree/main/kernel" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/SimHacker/moollm/tree/main/kernel</a></p><p>Happy to answer questions about any of the weird design decisions!</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46578614"><td></td></tr><tr id="46578267"><td></td></tr><tr id="46577540"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46577540" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46577540&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46577242"></a></center></td><td><br>

<p><img height="100" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2026/2026.png" alt="Gentoo Fireworks">
Happy New Year 2026! Once again, a lot has happened in Gentoo over the past months. New developers, 
more binary packages, GnuPG alternatives support, Gentoo for WSL, improved Rust bootstrap, better NGINX packaging, …
As always <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/news/2026/01/05/new-year.html">here 
we’re going to revisit all the exciting news</a> from our favourite Linux distribution.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="gentoo-in-numbers">Gentoo in numbers</h2>

<p>Gentoo currently consists of <strong>31663 ebuilds</strong> for <strong>19174 different packages</strong>. For amd64 (x86-64), 
there are <strong>89 GBytes of binary packages</strong> available on the mirrors. Gentoo each week builds <strong>154
distinct <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/">installation stages</a></strong> for different processor architectures
and system configurations, with an overwhelming part of these fully up-to-date.</p>

<p><strong>The number of commits to the <a href="https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/">main ::gentoo repository</a></strong>
has remained at an overall high level in 2025, with a slight decrease from <em>123942</em> to <em>112927</em>. 
The number of commits by external contributors was <em>9396</em>, now across <em>377</em> unique external authors.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:GURU">GURU</a>, our user-curated repository with a trusted user model</strong>, 
as entry point for potential developers, has shown a decrease in activity.
We have had <em>5813</em> commits in 2025, compared to <em>7517</em> in 2024.
The number of contributors to GURU has increased, from <em>241</em> in 
2024 to <em>264</em> in 2025. Please join us there and help packaging the latest and 
greatest software. That’s the ideal preparation for becoming a Gentoo developer!</p>

<p>Activity has slowed down somewhat on the <strong>Gentoo bugtracker <a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/">bugs.gentoo.org</a></strong>, 
where we’ve had 20763 bug reports created in 2025, compared to 26123 in 2024. The number of resolved bugs 
shows the same trend, with 22395 in 2025 compared to 25946 in 2024. The current values are closer to those
of 2023 - but clearly this year we fixed more than we broke!</p>

<h2 id="new-developers">New developers</h2>

<p>In 2025 we have gained <strong>four new Gentoo developers</strong>. They are in chronological order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:Jayofdoom">Jay Faulkner (jayf)</a></strong>: 
<img height="45" src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4d954eb088999562bfad4ae37e55b0e5?s=45&amp;d=retro">

In Gentoo and open source in general, he’s very much involved with OpenStack; further, he’s a 
a big sports fan, mainly ice hockey and NASCAR racing, and already long time Gentoo enthusiast.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:Mmike">Michael Mair-Keimberger (mm1ke)</a></strong>:
<img height="45" src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8739f5760b3d0c117a8927bfa04283c5?s=45&amp;d=retro">
Michael <a href="https://public-inbox.gentoo.org/gentoo-project/61af69b7-9bc8-44aa-8a13-359d15be1b9c@gentoo.org/T/#m67350f2a895898cef59e295ed28cbe8f2b0b43bc">joined 
us finally in June</a> from Austria, after already amassing over 9000 commits beforehand.
Michael works as Network Security Engineer for a big System House in Austria and likes
to go jogging regulary and hike the mountains on weekends. In Gentoo, he’s active in quality
control and cleanup.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:APN-Pucky">Alexander Puck Neuwirth (apn-pucky)</a></strong>:
<img height="45" src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a0aa4ffb52fcf5a790adac911e1de3ca?s=45&amp;d=retro">
Alexander, a physics postdoc, <a href="https://public-inbox.gentoo.org/gentoo-project/87tt1jhst4.fsf@robot.e.airelinux.org/T/#m96e183e27e464fd7508eca5ae8721e03ec8c3e87">joined 
us in July</a> from Italy. At the intersection of Computer Science, Linux, and high-energy physics,
he already uses Gentoo to manage his code and sees it as a great development environment.
Beyond sci-physics, he’s also interested in continuous integration and RISC-V.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Jaco Kroon (jkroon)</strong>:
<img height="45" src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5144f854e6da57161798e7e931a1959d?s=45&amp;d=retro">

up as developer in October</a> from South Africa. He is a system administrator who works for a
company that runs and hosts multiple Gentoo installations, and has been around in Gentoo since 2003!
Among our packages, Asterisk is one example of his interests.</p>

<h2 id="featured-changes-and-news">Featured changes and news</h2>

<p>Let’s now look at the major improvements and news of 2025 in Gentoo.</p>

<h3 id="distribution-wide-initiatives">Distribution-wide Initiatives</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2026/logo-codeberg.png">
<b>Goodbye Github, welcome Codeberg</b>: Mostly because of the continuous attempts to force Copilot usage
for our repositories, Gentoo currently considers and plans the migration of our repository mirrors and pull
request contributions to <a href="https://codeberg.org/">Codeberg</a>. Codeberg is a site based on 
<a href="https://forgejo.org/">Forgejo</a>, maintained by a non-profit organization, and located in Berlin, Germany. Gentoo
continues to host its own primary git, bugs, etc infrastructure and has no plans to change that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>EAPI 9</strong>: The wording for EAPI 9, a new version of the <a href="https://projects.gentoo.org/pms/latest/pms.pdf">specifications 
for our ebuilds</a>, has been finalized and approved, and support in Portage is complete.
<a href="https://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/eapi/index.html#eapi-9">New features</a> in EAPI 9 include 
<em>pipestatus</em> for better error handling, an <em>edo</em> function for printing a command and executing it, a cleaner environment for the
build processes, and the possibility of declaring a default EAPI for the profile directory tree.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2025/logo-fosdem-2025.png">
<b>Event presence</b>: At <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2025/">FOSDEM 2025</a> in Brussels, Gentoo has been present
once more with a stand, this year together with <a href="https://www.flatcar.org/">Flatcar Container Linux</a> (which 
is based on Gentoo). Naturally we had mugs, stickers, t-shirts, and of course the famous self-compiled buttons… 
Further, we have been present at 
<a href="https://www.froscon.org/">FrOSCon 2025</a> in Sankt Augustin with workshops
<a href="https://programm.froscon.org/froscon2025/talk/3dd88e67-7e4e-42cc-8a51-85de837f1f45/"><i>Gentoo installation and 
configuration</i></a> and <a href="https://programm.froscon.org/froscon2025/talk/cd1358e9-43c7-430f-982f-28f5b6dcc163/"><i>Writing 
your own ebuilds</i></a>. Last but not least, the toolchain team has represented Gentoo at the 
<a href="https://gnu-tools-cauldron.org/">GNU Tools Cauldron 2025</a> in Porto.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2024/logo-spi.png">
<b>SPI migration</b>: The migration of our financial structure to <a href="https://www.spi-inc.org/">Software in 
the Public Interest (SPI)</a> is continuing slowly but steadily, with expense payments following the moving intake. 
If you are donating to Gentoo, and especially if you are a recurrent donor, please change your payments to be directed
to SPI; see also our <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/donate/">donation web page</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Online workshops</b>: Our German support, <a href="https://gentoo-ev.org/">Gentoo e.V.</a>, is grateful to the speakers
and participants of <a href="https://gentoo-ev.org/news/online-workshops-2025/">four online workshops</a> in 2025 
in German and English, on topics as varied as <i>EAPI 9</i> or <i>GnuPG and LibrePGP</i>. We are looking forward to more exciting 
events in 2026.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="architectures">Architectures</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2025/logo-riscv.png">
<b>RISC-V bootable QCOW2</b>:
Same as for amd64 and arm64, also for RISC-V we now have ready-made bootable disk images in QCOW2 format
<a href="https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/#riscv">available for download on our mirrors</a> in a console and
a cloud-init variant. The disk images use the rv64gc instruction set and the lp64d ABI, and can be booted via
the standard RISC-V UEFI support.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2026/logo-wsl.png">
<b>Gentoo for WSL</b>: We now publish weekly Gentoo images for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/">Windows
Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</a>, based on the amd64 stages, 
<a href="https://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/amd64/autobuilds/current-stage4-amd64-wsl-systemd/">see our mirrors</a>. 
While these images are not present in the Microsoft store yet, that’s something we intend to fix soon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>hppa and sparc destabilized</b>: Since we do not have hardware readily available anymore and these architectures
mostly fill a retrocomputing niche, stable keywords have been dropped for both hppa (PA-RISC) and sparc.
The architectures will remain supported with testing keywords.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2022/logo-musl.png">
<b>musl with locales</b>: Localization support via the package 
<a href="https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-apps/musl-locales">sys-apps/musl-locales</a> has been added by default 
to the Gentoo stages based on the <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">lightweight musl C library</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="packages">Packages</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><img height="125" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2026/freepg-goose.png">
<b>GPG alternatives</b>: Given the unfortunate fracturing of the GnuPG / OpenPGP / LibrePGP ecosystem due to competing standards,
we now provide an alternatives mechanism to choose the system gpg provider and ease compatibility testing. At the moment, 
<a href="https://gnupg.org/">the original, unmodified GnuPG</a>, <a href="https://freepg.org/">the FreePG fork/patchset</a> 
as also used in many other Linux distributions (Fedora, Debian, Arch, …), and the re-implementation 
<a href="https://sequoia-pgp.org/">Sequoia-PGP</a> with 
<a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia-chameleon-gnupg#sequoias-reimplementation-of-the-gnupg-interface">Chameleon</a>
are available. In practice, implementation details vary between the providers, and while GnuPG and FreePG are fully supported,
you may still encounter difficulties when selecting Sequoia-PGP/Chameleon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>zlib-ng support:</strong> We have introduced initial support for using <a href="https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng">zlib-ng</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/zlib-ng/minizip-ng">minizip-ng</a> in compatibility mode in place of the reference zlib libraries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img height="85" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2026/logo-steve.png">
<b>System-wide jobserver</b>: We have created <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Steve">steve</a>, an implementation of a
token-accounting system-wide jobserver, and introduced experimental global jobserver support in Portage. Thanks to that, it 
is now possible to globally control the concurrently running build job count, correctly accounting for parallel emerge jobs, 
make and ninja jobs, and other clients supporting the jobserver protocol.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>NGINX rework</b>: The packaging of the <a href="https://nginx.org/">NGINX web server and reverse proxy</a> in Gentoo has 
undergone a major improvement, including also the splitting off of several third-party modules into separate packages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2025/logo-rust.png">
<b>C++ based Rust bootstrap</b>: We have added a bootstrap path for Rust from C++ using 
<a href="https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc">Mutabah’s Rust compiler mrustc</a>, which alleviates the
need for pre-built binaries and makes it significantly easier to support more configurations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Ada and D bootstrap</b>: Similarly, Ada and D support in gcc now have clean bootstrap paths, which makes enabling these
in the compiler as easy as switching the useflags on gcc and running emerge.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2026/logo-flexiblas.png">
<b>FlexiBLAS</b>: Gentoo has adopted the new <a href="https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/flexiblas">FlexiBLAS wrapper
library</a> as the primary way of switching implementations of the BLAS numerical algorithm library at runtime.
This automatically also provides ABI stability for linking programs and bundles the specific treatment of different BLAS
variants in one place.</p>

<ul>
  <li><img height="75" src="https://www.gentoo.org/assets/img/news/2023/dollar.jpg">
<b>Income</b>: The Gentoo Foundation took in $12,066 in fiscal year 2025 (ending 2025/06/30); the dominant part 
(over 80%) consists of individual cash donations from the community. On the SPI side, we received $8,471 
in the same period as fiscal year 2025; also here, this is all from small individual cash donations.</li>
  <li><strong>Expenses</strong>: Our expenses in 2025 were, program services (e.g. hosting costs) $8,332, management &amp; general (accounting) 
$1,724, fundraising $905, and non-operating (depreciation expenses) $10,075.</li>
  <li><strong>Balance</strong>: We have $104,831 in the bank as of July 1, 2025 (which is when our fiscal year 2026 starts for accounting 
purposes). The <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Foundation:Gentoo_Foundation_Finances_FY2025">Gentoo Foundation FY2025 financial statement</a>

	<p>I run Artix, by the way.  
</p>
<p>There. That's out of the way. I recently installed Linux on my main desktop computer and work laptop, overwriting the Windows partition completely. Essentially, I deleted the primary operating system from the two computers I use the most, day in and day out, instead trusting all of my personal and work computing needs to the Open Source community. This has been a <a href="https://betanews.com/2025/09/07/as-windows-10-reaches-end-of-life-windows-11-is-losing-market-share/" target="_blank">growing trend</a>, and I hopped on the bandwagon, but for good reasons. Some of those reasons might pertain to you and convince you to finally make the jump as well. Here's my experience.</p></div><div id="c15269001"><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/copilot-spying-on-you.jpg" title="It feels like Copilot is always spying on you.

Anyone who has read one of those articles or watched one of those videos will know it boils down to two main issues: telemetry and poor software stability.  
</p>
<p>It's no secret that Windows 11 <a href="https://securelist.com/forensic-artifacts-in-windows-11/117680/" target="_blank">harvests data</a> like a pumpkin farmer in October, and there is no easy way (and sometimes no way at all) to stop it. The operating system itself acts exactly like what was called "spyware" a decade or so ago, pulling every piece of data it can about its current user. This data includes (but is far from limited to) hardware information, specific apps and software used, usage trends, and more. With the advent of AI, Microsoft made headlines with Copilot, an artificial assistant designed to help users by capturing their data with tools like Recall. It turns out that Copilot has largely been a flop and helps Microsoft (and data thieves) more than its users.</p></div></div><div id="c15247842"><div><p>The other main reason folks uninstall Windows is due to the overall poor software experience. Windows 11 has multiple settings modules to handle the same task (such as setting up networking or adding devices), and none of them seem to talk to each other. Additionally, each new update (which will eventually be forced upon you) seems to bring more bugs than fixes. Personally, I encountered 2-3 full system crashes a week when I ran Windows 11, and my hardware is fairly decent: AMD <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-Ryzen-7-6800H-Processor-Benchmarks-and-Specs.589871.0.html" target="_self">Ryzen 7 6800H</a>, 32 GB of RAM, and a 1 TB PCIe NVMe drive. Still, a few times a week, my computer would freeze for a few seconds, the displays would go dark, and the PC would either restart or hang indefinitely.   
</p>
<p>After dealing with these issues and trying to solve them with workarounds, I dual-booted a Linux partition for a few weeks. After a Windows update (that I didn't choose to do) wiped that partition and, consequently, the Linux installation, I decided to go whole-hog: I deleted Windows 11 and used the entire drive for Linux.</p></div><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/Linux-Windows-OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher-logos.jpg" title="There are lots of Linux distros out there, but the overall experience is largely the same between them.

	<p>The first question often asked of Windows refugees migrating to Linux is, "Why Linux?" It's a good question, and one that needs to be asked before dumping Windows for anything else. Personally, I tried macOS first. The experience was smooth and easy but ultimately felt restrictive (installing from third-party developers, anyone?). Additionally, the only Apple computer I have is a 2014 MacBook Air. As such, the latest version of macOS I could actually run is 11 (Big Sur), which was released in 2020. Overall system operation was quite sluggish on the older hardware, and I knew that time would inevitably take its toll on the software experience — apps would soon be out of date and I wouldn't be able to update them. I also tried the OpenCore Legacy Patcher to push the laptop to macOS 13. While performance improved, key features like iMessage and Continuity Camera were either buggy or flat out refused to work. It felt like my laptop was running in mud with its hands tied behind its back. Plus, I needed something for my desktop. Not wanting to drop a mortgage payment or two on new hardware, I opted for Linux.  
</p>
<p>Linux promised me the potential of what I wanted - high hardware compatibility with full software freedom. The operating system can run on pretty much anything, and it grants users a huge amount of control over their system. I tried out a few ditributions, or distros, of Linux. A distro is like a "flavor" of Linux, and each one has unique factors (e.g., app/package management, bundled user interface). With most distros, these differences are largely irrelevant; most distros offer the same main packages as others.</p></div><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1" id="c15270364"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/Linux-distro-journey83.png" title="Picking a Linux distro can be a long and winding journey.

I started this journey with some Linux experience under my belt; I have installed Linux on Chromebooks and old laptops (which I briefly referenced in <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Age-before-beauty-Why-a-decade-old-laptop-is-more-than-enough.858863.0.html" target="_self">this article</a>). Mint is considered a "just works" distro since it usually comes packaged with all the drivers and software most users would need. You can get to work within seconds of booting a fresh install without needing to fuss about in text files and the package manager. Mint was a nice experience, but it was a bit too bloated for my tastes (meaning it came with too much software preinstalled). I settled for Mint on my family's home theatre PC due to its stability and wide array of packages, and it hasn't failed us yet. For my own personal use, I wanted something a bit more "techy" and robust in terms of user features and system control.</p></div><div id="c15270363"><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/artix-fastfetch-neofetch75.jpg" title="Artix gives users complete control over their system, for better or for worse.

(Image source: Fastfetch of own PC)</figcaption></figure></div><p>I tried out a few other distros, including Debian (which I ran on my work laptop and now use on the office PC at the coffee shop I own and manage), Bazzite, Fedora, and Void. These were all fine, save for Void — the XBPS repository of Void Linux was too sparse for what I needed, and driver compatibility was a big issue on my work laptop and home PC. I finally settled on Artix Linux, which is a derivative of Arch Linux. Artix has all the features and control of Arch, including the robust Arch User Repository for plenty of packages and applications. It is also a pretty lightweight distro in that it doesn't come with much out of the box. Artix differs from Arch in that it does not use SystemD as its init system. I won't go down the rabbit hole of init systems here, but suffice it to say that Artix boots lightning quick (less than 10 seconds from a cold power on) and is pretty light on system resources. However, it didn't come "fully assembled."</p></div><div id="c15274083"><div><p>My laptop is a 2014 MacBook Air, which is still a pretty solid machine. Unfortunately, Linux doesn't always play nice with Apple products. The biggest problem I ran into after installing Artix on the Air was the lack of wireless drivers, which meant that WiFi did not work out of the box. The resolution was simple: I needed to download the appropriate WiFi drivers (Broadcom drivers, to be exact) from Artix's main repository. This is a straightforward process handled by a single command in the Terminal, but it requires an internet connection... which my laptop did not have. Ultimately, I connected a USB-to-Ethernet adapter, plugged the laptop directly into my router, and installed the WiFi drivers that way. The whole process took about 10 minutes, but it was annoying nonetheless.  
</p>
<p>For the record, my desktop (an AMD Ryzen 7 6800H-based system) worked flawlessly out-of-the-box, even with my second monitor's uncommon resolution (1680x1050, vertical orientation). I did run into issues with installing some packages on both machines. Trying to install the KDE desktop environment (essentially a different GUI for the main OS) resulted in strange artifacts that put white text on white backgrounds in the menus, and every resolution I tried failed to correct this bug. After reverting to XFCE4 (the default desktop environment for my Artix install), the WiFi signal indicator in the taskbar disappeared. This led to me having to uninstall a network manager installed by KDE and re-linking the default network manager to the runit services startup folder. If that sentence sounds confusing, the process was much more so. It has been resolved, and I have a WiFi indicator that lets me select wireless networks again, but only after about 45 minutes of reading manuals and forum posts.&nbsp;</p></div><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/Artix-boxing-apple.png" title="Apple and Linux don't always play nicely together.

Not all games on Steam that are deemed Linux compatible actually are. <i>Civilization III Complete</i> is a good example: launching the game results in the map turning completely black. (Running the game through an application called Lutris resolved this issue.) Not all the software I used on Windows is available in Linux, such as Greenshot for screenshots or uMark for watermarking photos in bulk. There are alternatives to these, but they don't have the same features or require me to relearn workflows.</p></div><div id="c15282832"><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/iPhone-loves-Linux93.png" title="Linux and iPhones can actually get along quite well, provided the right packages are used.

Android management is fairly straightforward due to how Android manages USB connections. An Android smartphone tends to be immediately recognized by Linux and act as a USB mass storage device. There's also ADB (Android Debugging Bridge) via the terminal for executing commands to an Android device. However, I use an iPhone. 
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Apple products and Linux don't always play together very well. This was certainly the case with my iPhone 13 Pro Max and Artix running the XFCE4 desktop environment. My phone would only charge when plugged in but wouldn't show up. I tried installing applications like KDE Connect, which promised to offer most of the same functions available between iPhones and Mac computers. Unfortunately, it was a no-go. But I found a solution in an unlikely place. 
</p>
<p>When I tried installing KDE (read above), it left the Dolphin file manager on my device. I started using Dolphin and preferred it to the default file manager for XFCE4 (Thunar). Dolphin held a pleasant surprise: it could detect my iPhone when it was plugged in. This made it a snap to transfer files to and from my phone as the file manager granted full file access to the iPhone. Due to how far Apple's file management has come on iOS, there were specific folders for each of my apps. The overall process is significantly easier than it was on Windows as iTunes is no longer needed.</p></div></div><div id="c15299297"><p>So why did I switch to Linux, and why am I writing this article about the experience? In a word: joy. I like using my computers again and find the experience fun. There's always something I can tweak or learn about how it operates. The fact that it runs faster than it did on Windows and is significantly more stable are huge bonuses.  
</p>
<p>There are lots of other points to discuss that would make this article more long-winded than it already is, so I will be brief on a few final specifics. Installing games via Steam is as simple as it is on any other OS, though compatibility will be a bit smaller than on Windows. Still, I've been able to play all of my Steam games (with the exception of <i>Civilization III</i> mentioned above) without any hiccups. In some cases, gameplay is a little bit smoother due to the lack of things like anticheat software running in the background.</p></div><div id="c15299300"><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/Conky48.jpg" title="Conky displays whatever system info you want and is highly customizable (if you have the technical know-how).

I use XFCE4, which can be customized quite a bit but requires some technical knowledge to beautify. It supports a tool called Conky, which can display system information on your desktop. It is highly customizable but uses a typescript format in a config file to do so. 
</p>
<p>Power management is a bit wonky on Linux. My MacBook Air seems to last as long as it did with macOS (it's an old laptop, so the battery has worn down), but sometimes a rogue process will keep the machine from sleeping when the lid is closed. However, the lighter nature of Artix means the laptop's fan rarely ramps up. This is true of my desktop as well. 
</p>
<p>Transferring one's system configuration, including desktop and application settings, is as easy as transferring a single folder, so my MacBook can look exactly like my desktop (provided it has the same packages installed) with a simple drag-and-drop. The additional flexibility in choosing my computer's UI is unrivaled: if I don't like something in XFCE, I can either tweak the actual configuration file or just install a new environment (though this comes with risks, as mentioned above). 
</p>
<p>Overall system stability has been excellent. My computer hasn't crashed a single time, and I've never run into graphical issues rendering a black screen like I did with Windows 11.</p></div></div><div id="c15299301"><div data-csc-images="1" data-csc-cols="1"><figure><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/Tux.png" title="Tux, the mascot of Linux.

It is like any other operating system in that it will require users to learn its methods and quirks. Admittedly, it does require a little bit more technical knowledge to dive into the nitty-gritty of the OS and fully unlock its potential, but many distributions (such as Mint) are ready to go out of the box and may never require someone to open a command line. Our main media PC runs Mint and my younger children (aged 4 and 5 as of this writing) are able to navigate it without issue. My older kids are able to load games on it and play with Bluetooth controllers with no issue. 
</p>
<p>Personally, I like a bit of a challenge, and Linux balances usability with the carrot of a deeper computing experience. Depending on the distribution, I could have been up and running immediately after installation, but I wanted something more. The beauty of Linux is its flexibility; you can use a distribution that is as challenging or straightforward as you like.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>Installing Linux not only saved three machines in my house (my laptop, desktop, and our media PC); it resurrected the joy of using a computer. It has been frustrating at times, but the rush of finally fixing a problem after a bit of work is unlike anything I felt on Windows. When I fix a problem on Windows, it's more of a shrug of the shoulder and relief that I'll no longer feel like I'm being stabbed in the eye. 
</p>
<p>I think that's because the issues I ran into on Linux were, for the most part, my fault. On Windows or macOS, most problems I run into are caused by a restriction or bug in the OS. Linux gives me the freedom to break my machine and fix it again, teaching me along the way. 
</p>
<p>With Microsoft's refusal (either from pride or ignorance) to improve (or at least not crapify) Windows 11 despite loud user outrage, switching to Linux is becoming a popular option. It's one you should consider doing, and if you've been thinking about it for any length of time, it's time to dive in.</p></div></div><div id="c15247735">

After graduating college with a degree in Mathematics, I worked in finance and banking a few years before taking a job as a database administrator. I started working with Notebookcheck in October of 2016 and have enjoyed writing news and reviews. I've also written for other outlets including UltrabookReview and GeeksWorldWide, focusing on consumer guidance and video gaming. My areas of interest include the business side of technology, retro gaming, Linux, and innovative gadgets. When I'm not writing on electronics or tinkering with a device, I'm either outside with my family, enjoying a decade-old video game, or playing drums or piano.</p></div>
