<p>This meteorite was far larger than the infamous Cretaceous era ending one. ‘We’re looking at a bolide that was 500 to 200 times bigger than the one that killed off the dinosaurs,’ says <a href="https://eps.harvard.edu/people/nadja-drabon">Nadja Drabon</a>, a geologist at Harvard University.</p>
<p>The Archean eon 2.5–4 billion years ago suffered at least 16 major impacts by meteorites upwards of 10km across. Each would have vaporised enough rock to darken the ancient skies for years.</p>
<p>Drabon’s group say the impact 3.26 billion years ago triggered a giant tsunami, as well as clouding the oceans and darkening the skies for years to decades. The impact also evaporated tens of metres of seawater.</p>
<p>Yet there was a silver lining: the churning of the seas brought bioavailable iron up from the ocean depths to its depleted surface and allowed some microbes to flourish, while the meteorite also brought phosphorus vital for life.</p>
<p>Drabon and her colleagues went in search of evidence of ancient major impacts in a remote area south of Kruger National Park in South Africa. There they sought out rocky outcrops containing a layer of spherules – molten droplets formed following a major meteorite impact that rained down over huge swathes of the planet. There are eight such spherule bands in this area, each preserving an ancient impact event.</p>
<p>While the impact crater itself is long gone, analysis of rocks from 3.26 billion years ago tells a tale of planetary devastation. The layer of spherules from this huge impact was 15 to 20cm thick in places, compared with less than a centimetre for the famed dinosaur-killing meteorite, says Drabon.</p>
<p>These ancient droplets contain spikes in iridium and chromium isotope anomalies, revealing their extraterrestrial origins. The glassy spherules were mixed into ripped-up seafloor materials, thought to be the result of gigantic tsunamis.</p>
<div data-attachment="537342" data-sequence="1">
<p><img alt="Figure" src="https://d2cbg94ubxgsnp.cloudfront.net/Pictures/480xAny/3/4/2/537342_giant_asteroid_pumelled_archaen_life14_637911.jpg" srcset="https://d2cbg94ubxgsnp.cloudfront.net/Pictures/480xAny/3/4/2/537342_giant_asteroid_pumelled_archaen_life14_637911.jpg 480w" loading="lazy" width="1347" height="1882">m</p>


</div>
<p>Above this layer are younger iron-rich rocks and minerals such as siderite and pyrite. ‘After the impact, we suddenly see a spike in iron in the sediment,’ says Drabon. This influx likely came from the deep ocean. The geologists also found a phosphorus spike after impact, calculating that the meteorite could have delivered 363 billion tonnes in a reduced and, therefore, bioavailable state.</p>
<p>Tellingly, the group also saw a change in the carbon isotope signature above the impact layer that they interpret as a rise in microbes with metabolism geared towards efficient iron cycling.&nbsp;This indicates a rebound of microbial life, perhaps within a few years to decades, the investigators conclude.</p>
<p>The group reason that, following the impact, the iron-metabolising microbes would have consumed the newly available Fe<sup>2+</sup> in the shallow seas, transforming it to Fe<sup>3+</sup>, which would sink to the ocean floor as iron hydroxides.</p>
<p>‘Their argument is very compelling, with many different lines of evidence,’ says <a href="https://cst.temple.edu/about/faculty-staff/alexandra-davatzes">Alexandra Davatzes</a>, a geologist at Temple University in Philadelphia, who was not part of the study. ‘We’re in a totally microbial world in the Archean and the potential for recovery would be much, much faster than today.’</p>
<p>This bounce back could have happened repeatedly. ‘Initially large bolide impacts might have killed off a lot of microbial activity on Earth’s surface and in shallow waters, but then have been good for microbial activity, especially in shallow water environments,’ says <a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/geowissenschaften/arbeitsgruppen/geo-und-umweltnaturwissenschaften/geo-und-umweltnaturwissenschaften/isotopengeochemie/arbeitsgruppe/staff/ronny-schoenberg/">Ronny Schönberg</a>, a geochemist at the University of Tübingen, Germany who was not part of the research.</p>
<p>It might even shift how we view meteorite hits on early Earth. ‘Everyone associates big impacts with the extinction of the dinosaurs and thinks of them as disastrous,’ says Drabon. ‘But they also carried a lot of transient benefits for the early and evolving biosphere.’</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">This is a free release of the source, manual, and executables of a 1991 Autodesk DOS program that was called  "James Gleick's CHAOS: The Software." The software was written by Josh Gordon, Rudy Rucker and John Walker. Rucker wrote most of the algorithms, except for the Fractal Landscapes algorithms, which are by John Walker.  Josh Gordon did the interface, and much of the implementation of the algorithm code. The program was written in consultation with James Gleick about his brilliant book, <a href="https://around.com/books/" rel="nofollow"> <i>Chaos: Making a New Science</i> </a>. This release is under a Gnu license.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I started learning Rust about 3 or 4 years ago. I am now knee-deep in several very complex Rust projects that keep slamming into the limitations of the Rust compiler. One of the most common and obnoxious problems is hitting a situation the borrow-checker can’t deal with and realizing that I need to completely re-architect how my program works, because lifetimes are “contagious” the same way async is. Naturally, Rust has both!</p><p>Despite how obviously useful the borrow-checker is in writing correct code, in practice it is horrendous to work with. This is because the borrow checker cannot run until an entire function compiles. Sometimes it seems to refuse to run until my entire file compiles. Because an explicit lifetime must come from somewhere, they have a habit of “floating up” through the stack, from the point of usage to the point of origin, infecting everything in-between with another explicit generic lifetime parameter. If you end up not needing it, you need to go through and delete every instance of this lifetime, which can sometimes be 30 or more generic statements that end up needing to be modified.</p><p>In the worst cases, your entire architecture simply cannot work with the borrow checker, and at minimum you’ll need to wrap things in an Rc&lt;&gt;, which again will requiring upwards of 30 or more statements depending on the complexity of your architecture. Other times you realize you need a split borrow, and have to then modify <em>every single function under the split borrow check</em> to take specific field references instead of the original type. These constant refactors have been a major detractor for the language for years, although some improvements, like <code>impl</code>, have reduced the need for refactoring in some narrow cases.</p><p>This means, to be a highly productive Rust programmer, you basically have to memorize the borrow checker rules, so you get it right the first time. This is stupid, because <em>the whole point</em> of having a type system or a borrow checker is to tell you when you get it wrong, so you <em>don’t</em> have to memorize how the borrow rules work. I don’t need to memorize how all the types work, because these errors get caught almost immediately, and rarely require massive refactors because the whole architecture doesn’t need to exist before it can identify problems.</p><p>This is painful because I am an experienced C++ programmer, and C++ has this exact problem except worse: undefined behavior. In the worst case, C++ simply doesn’t check anything, compiles your code wrong, and then does inexplicable and impossible things at runtime for no discernable reason (or it just deletes your entire function). If you run <code>ubsan</code> (undefined behavior sanitizer), it will at least explode at runtime with an error message. Unfortunately, it can only catch undefined behavior that actually happens, so if your test suite doesn’t cover all your code branches you might have undefined behavior lurking in the code somewhere. Even worse, the very existence of undefined behavior sometimes creates a new branch you couldn’t possibly think of testing without knowing about the undefined behavior in the first place!</p><p>This means that in order to write C++, you effectively have to memorize the undefined behavior rules, which sucks. Sound familiar? This is both stupid and strictly worse than Rust, because there is no compile-time error at all, only a runtime error if you get it wrong (and you are running <code>ubsan</code>). However, because it’s a runtime error, correcting it usually requires less total refactoring… usually.</p><p>At this point, C++ can’t fix it’s undefined behavior problem because C++ uses undefined behavior to drive optimization, so now it’s just stuck like this forever. Rust can’t really fix borrow checking either, because borrow checking is embedded so deeply into the compiler at this point. All Rust can do is make the borrow checker more powerful (probably by introducing partial borrows, which seems stuck in eternal bikeshedding hell) or introduce more powerful IDE tooling that can make refactors less painful and more automatic, like automatically removing a generic parameter from everywhere it was used.</p><p>Problems like these are unfortunate, because it drives people towards using C for it’s “simplicity”, when in reality they are simply deferring logic errors until runtime. I think Rust manages to “get away” with it’s excessive verbosity because “safe C++” is even more horrendously verbose and arcane, and safe C++ is what Rust is really competing against right now. I just think Rust needs more competition.</p><p>Any prospective Rust competitor, however, needs to be very cognizant of the tradeoffs they force programmers to make in exchange for correctness. It is not sufficient to invent a language that makes it possible to write provably correct kernel-level code, it has to be <em>easy to use</em> as well, and we really need to get away from indirectly forcing programmers to anticipate what the compiler will do simply to be productive. It’s not the 1970s anymore, writing a program shouldn’t feel like taking a stack of punchcards to the mainframe to see if it works or not. Rust is not the answer, it is simply a step towards the answer.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="article-body">

            <p><span>Daniel Kish navigates the world </span>like a bat does—and he does so without ever leaving the ground.</p>
<p>After losing his vision as an infant, Kish taught himself to move around with the help of echolocation. Like bats, Kish uses his mouth to produce a series of short, crisp clicking sounds, and then listens to how those sounds bounce off the surrounding landscape. (Our winged neighbors tend to emit these clicks at <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/what-does-echolocation-sound-like">frequencies humans can’t hear</a>, but Kish’s clicks are perfectly audible to human ears.) From there, Kish makes a mental map of his environment, considering everything from broad contours—like walls and doors—down to textural details.</p>
<p>Kish now <a href="https://visioneers.org/">teaches echolocation</a>, mostly to students who are blind. For these students, Kish believes that an echolocation practice can buoy confidence and independence. Kish’s own experience is persuasive—he famously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xATIyq3uZM4">bikes along hilly, car-lined streets</a>—and a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23538130">growing body</a> of <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/dav/aaua/2009/00000095/00000002/art00013?token=004d187194fb161639412f415d763f256f45504a6c4273516f2530482972715a614f6d4e227ac">scholarly research</a> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005670#sec015">has begun to unpack exactly how</a> expert echolocaters do their thing. This research has also backed up the idea that this skill <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/06/echolocation/">is highly learnable</a>. When <a href="https://whitneylab.berkeley.edu/publications.html">researchers at the University of California, Berkeley</a>, asked novice echolocators to use tongue clicks to determine which of the two objects in front of them was larger, the newbies were <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2013/01/28/170355712/be-like-a-bat-sound-can-show-you-the-way">soon able to do so</a> in a way that the scientists couldn’t attribute to chance.</p>
<p>Whatever your sightedness, there’s something to be said for learning to listen more attentively to sonic scenery. Kish believes that vision has a way of blunting the other senses unless people work to really flex them. Deft echolocators, he says, are able to perceive fine differences—distinguishing, say, between an oleander bush (“a million sharp returns”) and an evergreen (“wisps closely packed together, which sound like a bit like a sponge or a curtain”). They’re discovering sonic wonder wherever they go. We asked Kish to tailor a lesson for first-timers just learning to listen to the landscape.</p>
<h2><strong>1) Practice tuning in </strong></h2>
<p>Before you begin producing your own sounds, just practice noticing the ways that sounds change around you. Try this exercise next time you’re in a car (assuming you’re not in the driver’s seat).</p>
<p>Crack open the window and close your eyes. This is a good chance to pass through a varied landscape pretty quickly, and begin to differentiate between sounds. “On a residential street, you should hear the sound of the car jump in and out as you pass other parked cars, possibly trees, posts, mailboxes, or houses near the curb,” Kish says. “Everything we pass reflects the sound of our car differently.” Prime yourself to pay attention to incidental soundtracks.</p>
<h2><strong>2) Pick your supplies</strong></h2>
<p>If you are a sighted person, you’ll want a blindfold. “It’s very, very difficult to discern these kinds of subtleties if your eyes are working at the same time,” Kish says. Occluding one sense gives the less-dominant ones room to stretch their legs.</p>
<p>Now is also a good time to stock up on what you’ll need for your practice sessions. First, you’ll need a metal tray or a bowl, so make sure you’ve got one on hand. Once you start moving through space later on, it will also help to have a trekking pole or a cane, or at least a partner you trust to shout if you wander too far off base.</p>

<h2><strong>3) Choose an environment</strong></h2>
<p>Expert echolocators like Kish can get a bit fancier with their choices, and try to hear the character of a room. Tin decor, buttresses, or other accoutrements that might make a realtor swoon will also give Kish reason to perk up his ears. “It will sound more alive,” he says. “It will sing to you.”</p>
<p>For beginners, picking the right place is a bit of a Goldilocks situation: You don’t want a flat field, where there’s nothing for sound to bounce off. Then again, you ought to steer clear of spots where your hearing will be impeded by, say, a sea of carpet. “Probably the best is a fairly quiet, open space without a lot of clutter, maybe a non-reverberant room,” Kish says.</p>
<h2><strong>4) Practice your clicks</strong></h2>
<p>Clicks are not created equal, and some of them will work against you. “The most commonly produced rubbish click is a ‘cluck,’” Kish says. A cluck sounds something like two clicks on top of each other, which masks the returning sound. A good click can’t be sloppy, and it must be possible to reliably reproduce.</p>
<p>For beginners, Kish says that a dental click fits the bill (this is a <em>tsk-tsk</em> sound, Kish says, “like you’re disappointed”). Another contender is the sound you might use to prompt a horse to giddy-up; a “ch” sound, as in “check” or “church,” is another option.</p>
<p>The key is finding the option that’s comfortable for you. “You settle on whatever click you can do, and stick to it,” Kish says.</p>
<figure><img src="https://img.atlasobscura.com/Wfh1-5xglNkC0CwxYJnlEnvcErFO4nsY0DJuCWQ-IzI/rt:fill/w:1200/el:1/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL2Fzc2V0/cy9mYjcxZTkxNWEw/ZDFjZjcxYzNfRWNo/b2xvY2F0aW9uXzIu/anBn.jpg" alt="Tune in!" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" id="article-image-59921" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Tune in!</figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>5) Start simple </strong></h2>
<p>The goal with clicking is to take stock of three things. The first is presence/absence (is something there?). Then, the location (what direction is it in?). Finally, distance (how far away is it?).</p>
<p>To teach these skills, Kish often starts with this exercise: Students pair up with a partner who holds a bowl or flat paddle somewhere above their head. The student clicks, turns their head, and tries to gauge where the bowl is—straight ahead, or off to the side?</p>
<p>Kish doesn’t click all the time—only when he needs to refresh the mental map he’s working from. For beginning students, though, it’s helpful to practice the physical mechanics of clicking, in order to learn how to listen to bouncing sounds.</p>
<h2><strong>6) Get moving</strong></h2>
<p>The next step is to do all of this while in motion. Walk along a hallway and try to listen for differences in sounds that might indicate corners or open doors.</p>
<p>At first, you’ll shuffle and fumble through this exercise, and it’s bound to be frustrating. Go ahead and ask your partner whether or not you’re on the right track—but, if you’re using a blindfold, keep it on. “The temptation is very strong to pop the blindfold off and on,” Kish says. “I resist that because there is an adaptation process that has to happen here. You disrupt it entirely when you pull off the blindfold. I wouldn’t use vision to spot-check an experience; I would try to avoid that.”</p>
<h2><strong>7) Stop when you need to</strong></h2>
<p>Moving through the world in a new way can be both thrilling and thoroughly disorienting. Kish has found that people who are sighted, and are unaccustomed to not being able to rely on their vision, need to take breaks every 30-45 minutes. His blind students, for whom non-visual navigation is routine, can hang in longer.</p>
<p>Echolocation takes patience and practice. Kish cautions that it’s hard to get good at this—it took him years. But trying it out can open your ears to the world.</p>

<h2>What is Logica?</h2>

<div>
<p>
  Logica is an <a href="https://github.com/evgskv/logica">open source</a>
  declarative logic programming language for data manipulation.
</p>

<p>
  Logica extends syntax of logic programming for intuitive and efficient data
  manipulation. It compiles to SQL thus providing you access to the power
  of SQL engines with the convenience of logic programming syntax.
</p>
</div>


  <h2>Examples</h2>


<p>
  One may say that for programming languages like Python and Java functions are the
  basic building blocks. For Logica and other logic programming languages
  those building blocks are <i>predicates</i>. 

  Logic program is defined as a set of rules that define output predicates
  from pre-defied predicates. Those pre-defined predecates represent input data.

  For example here is a rule to identify names of expensive books, from an existing
  table of book prices.
</p>


<p>
# Logica rule to get expensive books.
ExpensiveBook(book_name) :-   # book_name is expensive if and only if
  Book(book_name, price),     # book_name costs price
  price &gt; 100;                # and price is greater than 100.
</p>

<p>
If you are familiar with SQL, you may see that the rule above
is equivalent to the flowing SQL statement. Not that familiarity with SQL is
required to learn Logica, not at all.
</p>

<p>
# SQL statement to get expensive books.
SELECT book_name
FROM book
WHERE price &gt; 100;
</p><p>

Predicate is a statement with variables. Any table can be treated as predicate,
where column names are the variables, and each row is a set of values of the variables
that satisfies the statement. 

While SQL is quite convenient for small queries like the one above it
gets hard to read when complexity grows. Logica leverages power of
mathematical syntax to scale nicely as complexity grows.

Let's assume we have a table <span>BabyNames</span>
that for each <span>name, year, city</span> and
<span>gender</span> specifies 
<span>number</span> of babies of that name born.
The following program finds a list of <i>popular</i> names, where a name
is defined as popular if it was the most popular name on some year.

</p><p>
# Count babies per year.
NameCountByYear(name:, year:) += number :-
  BabyNames(name:, year:, number:);
  
# For each year pick the most popular.
TopNameByYear(year) ArgMax= name -&gt; NameCountByYear(name:, year:);

# Accumulate most popular name into a table, droppig the year.
PopularName(name: TopNameByYear());
</p><p>

Sometimes data analysis requires solving algorithmic problems. Logica's
syntax is suited for it naturally. Here is a program finding prime numbers
that are less than 100.

</p><p>
  # Define numbers 1 to 30.
  Number(x + 1) :- x in Range(30);
  
  # Defining composite numbers.
  Composite(a * b) distinct :- Number(a), Number(b), a &gt; 1, b &gt; 1;
  
  # Defining primes as "not composite".
  Prime(n) distinct :- Number(n), n &gt; 1, ~Composite(n);
</p>

<p>
Finally here is an example of program that runs over
<a href="https://www.gdeltproject.org/">GDELT Project</a> dataset,
finding people mentioned in the context of "artificial general intelligence".
</p>


<p>Observe that program is divided into a rule defining predicate
  <span>NewsData</span> and rule for <span>AgiMentions</span>.
The first rule is essentially doing data cleaning, formatting the dataset in a shape
that is convenient to use. Then second rule peforms the task at hand.
</p>

<p>
In Logica problems are naturally split into smaller components that end up
reusable. So in the future if we have more analysis to do with GDELT dataset
we may take advantage of the <span>NewsData</span> predicate that we just wrote.
</p>

<p>
# Structuring the data conveniently.
NewsData(year:, month:, day:, persons:, quotations:) :-
  gdelt-bq.gdeltv2.gkg(persons: persons_str, quotations:, date: date_num),
  # Column `data` in GDELT dataset is given as an integer.
  year == ToInt64(Substr(ToString(date_num), 1, 4)),
  month == ToInt64(Substr(ToString(date_num), 5, 2)),
  day == ToInt64(Substr(ToString(date_num), 7, 2)),
  persons List= (person :- person in Split(persons_str, ";"));

# Performing the task at hand.
@OrderBy(AgiMentions, "mentions desc");
@Limit(AgiMentions, 10);
AgiMentions(person:, mentions? += 1) distinct :-
  person in persons,
  Like(quotations, "%artificial general intelligence%"),
  NewsData(persons:, quotations:);

</p><p>

This program completes in interactive time
when ran over the 4TB dataset
via BigQuery.

  <h2> Why Logica? </h2><p>

Logica is for engineers, data scientists and other specialists who 
need to perform complex data processing and analysis.
Queries and pipelines written in Logica can run on
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery">BigQuery</a>, <a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>
and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> engines.
Information stored in these systems is thus available in Logica.


</p><p>
Logica compiles to SQL and gives you access to the power of SQL engines,
including the massively distrbuted Google BigQuery engine,
with the convenience of logic programming syntax. This is useful because
BigQuery is magnitudes more powerful than state of the art native
logic programming engines.
</p>

<p>
We encourage you to try Logica, especially if
</p>

<ul>
  <li>   you already use logic programming and need more computational power, or </li>
  <li>   you already have data in BigQuery, PostgreSQL or SQLite, or </li>
  <li>   you want to learn logic programming and apply it to processing of Big Data.</li>
</ul><p>

Among other engines, there is partial support for Trino and Databricks.

<h2> I have not heard of logic programming. What is it? </h2>

<p>
Logic programming is a declarative programming paradigm where the program is
written as a set of logical statements.
</p>

<p>
Logic programming was developed in academia from the late 60s. Prolog and
Datalog are the most prominent examples of logic programming languages. 
Logica is a successor to
<a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43462/">Yedalog</a>,
a language created at Google earlier. Logica as well as Yedalog belong to
Datalog family.
</p>

<p>
Datalog and relational databases start from the same idea: think of data
as relations and think of data manipulation as a sequence of operations over
these relations. But Datalog and SQL differ in how these operations are
described. Datalog is inspired by the mathematical syntax of the first order
propositional logic and SQL follows the syntax of natural language.
</p>

<p>
SQL was based on the natural language to give access to databases to the people
without formal training in computer programming or mathematics. This convenience
may become costly when the logic that you want to express is non trivial.
There are many examples of hard-to-read SQL queries that correspond to simple
logic programs.
</p>

<p>
Logica follows Yedalog in the attempt to merge these branches back together:
extending the elegant syntax of Logic Programming to solve practical problems
and leverage the tremendous advances of SQL infrastructure for the execution.
</p>


<h2>How does Logica work?</h2><p>

Logica compiles the logic program into a SQL expression,
so it can be executed on BigQuery, the state of the art SQL engine.

Among database theoreticians Datalog and SQL are known to be equivalent.
And indeed the conversion from Datalog to SQL and back is often straightforward.
However there are a few nuances, for example how to treat disjunction and negation. In Logica we tried to make choices that make understanding of the resulting SQL structure as easy as possible, thus empowering user to write programs that are executed efficiently.

</p><h2>Why is it called Logica?</h2><p>

Logica stands for <b>Logic</b> with <b>a</b>ggregation.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>A devastating accident in Toronto involving a Tesla Model Y resulted in the tragic deaths of four individuals and the miraculous rescue of a young woman. The crash, which occurred on October 24, has raised serious questions about the safety of Tesla’s electronic door mechanisms.</p>



<p>A Tesla Model Y carrying five passengers lost control while traveling at high speed. The vehicle struck a guardrail and subsequently collided with a concrete pillar, bursting into flames upon impact. The collision took place on a local roadway, as confirmed by Toronto Police Duty Inspector Phillip Sinclair during a news conference.</p>



<p>Three men, aged 26, 29, and 32, and a 30-year-old woman were pronounced dead at the scene. A 25-year-old woman survived the horrific accident and was transported to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.</p>



<p>The sole survivor owes her life to the quick actions of Rick Harper, a 73-year-old Canada Post worker, who came upon the burning vehicle. Harper, along with other bystanders, noticed that the passengers were trapped inside the Tesla, unable to open the electronic doors.</p>



<p>Harper recounted to the <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/she-couldn-t-get-out-deadly-toronto-tesla-fire-draws-attention-to-risk-of-electronic/article_c9313fbe-9ad0-11ef-998a-93ba9a9927d5.html?utm_source=rakuten&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;ranMID=53416&amp;ranEAID=TnL5HPStwNw&amp;ranSiteID=TnL5HPStwNw-dj2l96o7bRjk1fk9blY9lQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Toronto Star</a>, “You couldn’t open the doors. I would assume the young lady would have tried to open the door from the inside because she was pretty desperate to get out.” Harper grabbed a bar from his truck and handed it to another bystander, who managed to break the back window and pull the young woman to safety.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://myelectricsparks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Four-Passengers-Die-in-Burning-Tesla-1-1024x683.webp" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20683'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://myelectricsparks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Four-Passengers-Die-in-Burning-Tesla-1-1024x683.webp"></figure>



<p>The Tesla Model Y’s electronic doors, which require power to operate, have come under scrutiny following the accident. Authorities are investigating whether the failure of these doors contributed to the fatalities. Harper mentioned that the thick smoke made it difficult to see the other passengers trapped inside, further complicating rescue efforts.</p>



<p>Tesla has faced criticism in the past for the design of its manual release levers, which are considered poorly designed and unintuitively placed. These emergency measures require intimate knowledge of the car, something that may not be feasible in a panic situation.</p>

<p>The Toronto Police and fire authorities are conducting a thorough investigation into the crash. Deputy Fire Chief Jim Jessop stated that they are examining the possibility that the intensity of the fire was linked to the car’s battery cells.</p>



<p>The crash has also highlighted concerns about the safety of electric vehicles in high-speed collisions. Despite the presence of manual release mechanisms in most Tesla models, the ease of access and usability of these features remain contentious issues.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.tps.ca/media-centre/news-releases/61244/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a>, Inspector Sinclair emphasized that no other vehicles were involved in the crash, and the investigation is ongoing. He also extended gratitude to Harper for his brave actions, stating, “Thanks very much to that bystander. We have been speaking to them, and obviously, they also are deeply affected by this incident, a very horrific scene for that bystander to step in.”</p>



<p>Harper expressed his shock and sorrow after learning about the deaths of the other passengers. “I was totally shocked. It really hit me when I saw the report in the news that four had died,” he told <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/fatal-crash-four-dead-lake-shore-cherry-1.7361751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CBC News</a>. Harper was later informed by detectives that the young woman he rescued was recuperating in the hospital.</p>



<p>This tragic incident has sparked a debate about the safety features of electric vehicles and the necessity for more intuitive emergency mechanisms. As authorities continue their investigation, the focus remains on understanding the causes of the crash and preventing such tragedies in the future.</p>



<p>Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but the company is likely to face increased scrutiny over the safety and design of its vehicles’ electronic systems. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential risks associated with advanced automotive technology and the importance of accessible emergency features.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										<p>Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope to peer back in time into the farthest reaches of the universe have found stunning evidence for <a href="https://thedebrief.org/newtons-law-of-universal-gravitation-is-challenged-by-controversial-new-astrophysics-discovery/">an alternate theory of gravity</a>.</p>
<p>Current models of galaxy formation in the early cosmos predict the presence of excess gravity caused by dark matter to pull material into slowly forming galaxies. However, an alternate theory of gravity first proposed in 1998 called Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) suggests that structures in the early universe formed very quickly without the need for theoretical dark matter.</p>
<p>Now, researchers from Case Western Reserve University say that scans of ancient galaxies gathered by the JWST seem to contradict the commonly accepted predictions of the most widely accepted Cold Dark Matter theory, Lambda-CDM. Instead, the readings seem to support a basis for MOND, which would force astronomers and cosmologists to reconsider this alternative and long-controversial theory of gravity.</p>
<h2><strong>The Dark Matter Debate</strong></h2>
<p>The Lambda-CDM model has long posited that dark matter, an elusive and invisible form of matter, is essential for explaining the structure of the universe. According to this model, dark matter’s gravitational influence shaped galaxies and caused the formation of large-scale structures. It predicts that ancient galaxies in the early universe should appear small and dim, as they were gradually pulled together by dark matter over cosmic time.</p>
<p>However, McGaugh and his colleagues argue that these predictions do not match JWST observations. Instead, the newly observed galaxies appear bright, large, and fully formed, even as scientists peer deeper into the universe’s past. This unexpected brightness directly challenges the conventional understanding of galaxy formation driven by dark matter.</p>
<p>“Astronomers invented dark matter to explain how you get from a very smooth early universe to big galaxies with lots of empty space between them that we see today,” said Stacy McGaugh, professor and director of astronomy at Case Western Reserve, in a press release announcing the study.</p>
<p>“(But) what the theory of dark matter predicted is not what we see.”</p>
<p>Specifically, McGaugh said that if the lambda-CDM model were accurate, the extra gravitational pull from dark matter, which only interacts with other matter through gravity, would cause small pieces of matter surrounding nascent galaxies to accrete to the center slowly.</p>
<h2><strong>MOND: A Radical Alternative Theory of Gravity</strong></h2>
<p>The MOND theory, first proposed in 1983 by Israeli physicist Mordehai Milgrom, offers a different explanation. MOND suggests modifying Newton’s second law to account for discrepancies observed in galaxy rotation curves without invoking dark matter. These modifications are relevant in regions of tiny accelerations, such as those experienced at the universe’s periphery, where JWST is now observing.</p>
<p>In 1998, McGaugh co-authored a seminal paper proposing that galaxy formation happened more rapidly and did not rely on dark matter. Instead, he and his co-authors, including Federico Lelli, Jay Franck, and James Schombert, theorized that galactic material was quickly collected, expanded with the universe, and then collapsed under gravity. This theory contends that galaxies came together early, forming large, luminous structures without the need for dark matter.</p>
<h2><strong>Evidence and Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>According to McGaugh and colleagues, JWST’s data aligns more closely with predictions made by MOND proponents than with Lambda-CDM models. As an example, McGaugh highlights that the MOND-based predictions of R H Sanders matched observations more accurately than those made by Lambda-CDM advocates Mo, Mao, and White. Yet, despite the recent success, MOND remains a contentious theory, as reconciling it with Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity—a foundation of modern physics—has proven elusive.</p>
<p>“We can always attempt to modify a theory to accommodate new facts,” McGaugh concedes, acknowledging that while facts inconsistent with one model do not necessitate abandoning it entirely, the inability to fully explain observational data might indicate a weaker theoretical framework. Even so, some modern astronomical measurements does still favor the dark matter hypothesis.</p>
<h2><strong>The Ongoing Case for Lambda-CDM</strong></h2>
<p>Despite MOND’s apparent success in explaining some JWST observations, Lambda-CDM continues to enjoy broad support. The model has accurately predicted the universe’s expansion rate since the 1920s, with evidence of a cosmological constant pushing the universe to perpetually expand. Additionally, while the universe is nearly flat, a requirement for Lambda-CDM, slight deviations remain a grey area for further exploration.</p>
<p>The broader astrophysical community remains cautious, and many researchers point out that Lambda-CDM has withstood numerous tests and provides a cohesive framework for understanding the universe. Even so, McGaugh is excited about the ongoing debate.</p>
<p>“The expectation was that every big galaxy we see in the nearby universe would have started from these itty-bitty pieces,” McGaugh said. “That’s not what JWST is showing us.”</p>
<p>McGaugh concedes that finding a theory compatible with both General Relativity and MOND remains an unrealized challenge. However, following the discoveries by the JWST that seem to support their MOND concept and its alternate theory of gravity, McGaugh says he and his colleagues are feeling somewhat vindicated.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is, ‘I told you so,’” McGaugh said. “I was raised to think that saying that was rude, but that’s the whole point of the scientific method: Make predictions and then check which come true.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-toc-container="">
			
<p>The Pentagon provided new details today about how its <a href="https://www.twz.com/air/dod-to-deploy-gremlin-sensors-to-collect-intel-on-unidentified-flying-objects">deployable, readily reconfigurable suite of sensors</a> called <a href="https://www.twz.com/air/dod-to-deploy-gremlin-sensors-to-collect-intel-on-unidentified-flying-objects">GREMLIN</a> works to help set the stage for figuring out what unidentified objects in our skies are and are not, if they appear at all. </p>



<p><a href="https://media.defense.gov/2024/Nov/14/2003583603/-1/-1/0/FY24-CONSOLIDATED-ANNUAL-REPORT-ON-UAP-508.PDF" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">In its annual report released on Thursday</a>, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) shared a graphic that gives us our best look yet at what its GREMLIN system is. It was developed by Georgia Tech Research Institute specifically to help gather data about so-called<a href="https://www.twz.com/flying-cylinders-diamonds-jet-pack-men-are-among-one-weeks-reports-from-faas-internal-hotline"> unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs</a>. That’s the DoD’s new parlance for what used to be called UFOs.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://www.twz.com/air/dod-to-deploy-gremlin-sensors-to-collect-intel-on-unidentified-flying-objects">AARO last discussed GREMLIN</a> back in March, the office said the system was designed to provide “hyperspectral surveillance to try to capture these incidents.” However, no details were given about what kind of sensors were being used to capture data across<a href="https://www.militaryaerospace.com/computers/article/16719396/raytheon-to-move-hyperspectral-sensor-program-aces-hy-forward-with-podded-flight-tests" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"> different areas of the electromagnetic spectrum</a> simultaneously.</p>



<p>Now deployed, GREMLIN includes 2D and 3D radars, long-range electro-optical/infrared sensors, GPS, satellite communications, aircraft tracking systems and radio frequency spectrum monitoring. It all feeds into a central node where the data can be fused to get a better sense of what’s out there. The system is something of an integrated air defense apparatus ‘in a box,’ allowing for multiple sensor types and open-source data to be captured on single targets within its view. </p>



<p>AARO began using GREMLIN “for detecting, tracking, and characterizing UAP,” the report noted. “GREMLIN demonstrated functionality and successfully collected data during a test event in March of 2024. The next step for GREMLIN is a 90-day pattern of life collection at a site of national security.”</p>

<p>One of AARO’s first missions for GREMLIN is to help establish a baseline for what would be considered normal activity, especially because so many UAPs have been reported either through sensors near military installations or by pilots. According to today’s report, nearly half of the 485 UAP sightings reported from May 1, 2023 to June 1, 2024 came from locations near U.S. military assets and sensors at home and abroad.&nbsp;This could be due to the objects being tasked to surveil those locations or due to sensor bias, as these areas are more heavily monitored than others, or more likely a mix of both.</p>



<p>East Asian seas were the hottest spot, providing 100 reports of which AARO resolved 40 as balloons or drones. AARO placed the remaining cases in Active Archive due to insufficient information to facilitate analysis, the report states.</p>



<p>“Right now we have this geographic bias where we are getting reports near the national security sites, but we also have a bias from pilots and other security personnel,” <a href="https://defensescoop.com/2024/08/26/leader-pentagon-uap-investigation-hub-jon-kosloski/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">AARO’s new Director Jon Kosloski</a> told reporters today. “So we want to have a better understanding of what normal looks like near those national security sites, and then eventually we’ll be expanding our baseline investigations to other areas in the US to look at what normal looks like away from national security sites.”</p>

<p>Kosloski refused to divulge where GREMLIN is located.</p>



<p>“It’s currently deployed,” he explained. “We’d rather not say exactly where it is, because we want it to be an unbiased test, and don’t want to invite folks to come and do flyovers and test against the system.”</p>



<p>The location was chosen, he added, “because of the environment. We expect there to be a lot of variety in the types of things that we’re going to see. And there have been UAP reports in that general area. And we’re trying to build a baseline.”</p>



<p>Once a pattern of life is established, the report suggested that AARO could use that to go back over some of the 444 cases placed in the Active Archive “because they lacked sufficient data to facilitate analysis.”</p>



<p>All told, AARO found that 49 cases during the reporting period were objects like balloons, birds and drones. <strong>“</strong>An additional 243 cases were recommended for closure as of June 1, 2024, pending peer review,” the report pointed out. “These cases also resolved to prosaic objects including balloons, birds, UAS, satellites, and aircraft.”</p>



<p>“AARO determined 21 cases merit further analysis by its IC [intelligence community] and science and technology (S&amp;T) partners,” the report acknowledged.</p>

<p>One thing AARO did not find was any indication that UAPs are either extraterrestrial or from an adversary here on Earth.</p>



<p>“AARO has discovered no verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity or technology,” Kosloski said. “None of the cases resolved by AARO have pointed to advanced capabilities or breakthrough technologies.”</p>



<p>Just because no evidence has been found of breakthrough technology does not mean the possibility doesn’t exist, he emphasizes.</p>



<p>“There are definitely anomalies,” Kosloski explained. “We have not been able to draw the link to extraterrestrials.”</p>



<p>“We’re not ruling it out,” he added.</p>



<p>Though the report found that there were 18 incidents of drones near U.S. nuclear infrastructure, weapons, and launch sites, Kosloski said there is no indication that either those or reported UAPs belonged to adversaries.</p>



<p>“We have not been able to correlate any UAP activity to adversarial collection activities or advanced technologies,” he posited.</p>



<p>The report also didn’t cover the drone incursions over Langley Air Force Base last December that we were the first to report back in March. You can read more about it in our exclusive story <a href="https://www.twz.com/air/mysterious-drones-swarmed-langley-afb-for-weeks">here</a>.</p>



<p>“It was known to be UAV activity, so we were there in a supporting role, but it was not our responsibility to address that,” Kosloski stated.</p>

<p>As it has been since UFOs first burst into the public’s consciousness back in the 1950s, the stigma of reporting them continues to keep people from coming forward to say what they’ve seen. Kosloski said he is concerned that could give adversaries an opening to collect data over sensitive locations. This is something <a href="https://www.twz.com/40054/adversary-drones-are-spying-on-the-u-s-and-the-pentagon-acts-like-theyre-ufos"><em>TWZ</em> has long highlighted as a major strategic awareness failure</a>.</p>



<p>Kosloski is “concerned that somebody could use the potential stigma to try and take advantage of that. If there is a stigma associated with reporting UAP, then that’s an opportunity for the adversary to maybe conduct collection operations and not have folks report on it. But we haven’t seen evidence of that yet.”</p>



<p>In an effort to help diminish the stigma of reporting UAPs, Kosloski said AARO is working with partners in the intelligence community and other government agencies to downgrade the classification ratings of incidents to make them more available to the public. Video of some of the cases AARO has discussed publicly will be released on Nov. 19.</p>



<p>“But there are interesting cases that I – my physics and engineering background and time in the IC – I do not understand, and I don’t know anybody else who understands them,” he said.</p>



<p>“The hope is that we will be able to release as much of that content as we can to the public so that we can get help in resolving them,” Kosloski commented.</p>



<p>More quickly and accurately identifying what some of the objects are is the hope for GREMLIN as well.</p>



<p>AARO has been under heavy ridicule by some proponents of UAP action, with claims that it is part of a coverup and has not executed its duties in good faith. Kosloski has taken over the office from its previous head, Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, who has repeatedly stood by his office’s investigations and methods. </p>

<p dir="auto">This course teaches data analysis, but it focuses on scientific models. The unfortunate truth about data is that nothing much can be done with it, until we say what caused it. We will prioritize conceptual, causal models and precise questions about those models. We will use Bayesian data analysis to connect scientific models to evidence. And we will learn powerful computational tools for coping with high-dimension, imperfect data of the kind that biologists and social scientists face.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Format</h2><a id="user-content-format" aria-label="Permalink: Format" href="#format"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Online, flipped instruction. I will pre-record the lectures each week. We'll meet online once a week for an hour to discuss the material. The discussion time (3-4pm Berlin Time) should allow people in the Americas to join in their morning.</p>
<p dir="auto">We'll use the 2nd edition of my book, &lt;<a href="https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/" rel="nofollow">Statistical Rethinking</a>&gt;, and possibly some draft chapters for the 3rd edition. I'll provide a PDF of the book to enrolled students.</p>
<p dir="auto">Registration: Registration hit the cap of 200 already and the wait list is also full. So registration is closed for this year. If people drop or stop attending discussions, I will invite from the wait list. - &lt;<a href="https://forms.gle/3HwkC9zpmaPdTmU79" rel="nofollow">Wait List</a>&gt;</p>

	<article><div>
		<p>I was talking to one of my students earlier, and lent him a book to
read over summer. It was only after he’d left that I realised that —
for me at any rate — the book I’d given him is probably the most
seminal work in the whole of computer science, and certainly the book
that’s most influenced my career and research&nbsp;interests.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>So what’s the book? <em>Structure and interpretation of computer
programs</em> by Hal Abelson and Jerry Sussman <span> (<span>MIT</span>
Press. 1984. <span>ISBN</span> 0-262-01077-1), also known as <em><span>SICP</span></em>.
</span>The book’s still in print, but — even better — is <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">available online in its
entirety</a>.</p>
<p><span>OK</span>, everyone has their favourite book: why’s this one so special to
me? The first reason is the time I first encountered it: in <a href="http://www.cs.newcastle.ac.uk/">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> in
<span>the second year of my first degree. I was still finding my way
in computer science, and this book was a recommended text after you’d
finished the first programming courses. It’s the book that introduced
me to programming <em>as it could be</em> (rather than programming
<em>as it was</em>, in Pascal at the time). What I mean by that is
that <span>SICP</span> starts out by introducing the elements of programming —
values, names, binding, control and so on — and then runs with them
to explore a quite dazzling breadth of issues&nbsp;including:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>lambda-abstraction and higher-order&nbsp;computation</span></li>
    <li><span>complex data structures, including structures with embedded computational&nbsp;content</span></li>
    <li><span>modularity and&nbsp;mutability</span></li>
    <li><span>streams</span></li>
    <li><span>lazy&nbsp;evaluation</span></li>
    <li><span>interpreter and compiler&nbsp;construction</span></li>
    <li><span>storage management, garbage collection and virtual&nbsp;memory
</span></li>
    <li><span>machine&nbsp;code
</span></li>
    <li><span>domain-specific&nbsp;languages</span></li>
</ul>
<p>…and so forth. The list of concepts is bewildering, and only stays coherent because the authors are skilled writers devoted to their craft. But it’s also a remarkable achievement to handle all these concepts within a single language framework — Scheme — in such a way that each builds on what’s gone&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>The second reason is the way in which Hal and Jerry view everything as
an exercise in language&nbsp;design:</p>
<blockquote>We have also obtained a glimpse of another crucial idea
about languages and program design. This is the approach of stratified
design, the notion that a complex system should be structured as a
sequence of levels that are described using a sequence of languages.
Each level is constructed by combining parts that are regarded as
primitive at that level, and the parts constructed at each level are
used as primitives at the next level. The language used at each level
of a stratified design has primitives, means of combination, and means
of abstraction appropriate to that level of detail.</blockquote>

<p>Layered abstraction of course is second nature to all computer
scientists. What’s novel in this view is that each level should be
<em>programmable</em>: that the layers are all about computation and
transformation, and not simply about hiding information. We don’t see
that in the mainstream of programming languages, because layering
doesn’t extend the language at all: Java is Java from top to bottom,
with class and libraries but no new control structures. If a
particular domain has concepts that would benefit from dedicated
language constructs, that’s just tough. Conversely (and this is
something that very much interests me) if there are constructs it’d be
desirable <em>not</em> to have in some domain, they can’t be removed.
(Within the language, anyway: Java-<span>ME</span> dumps some capabilities in the
interests of running on small devices, but that’s not something you
can do without re-writing the&nbsp;compiler.)</p>
<p>The third influential feature is the clear-sighted view of what
computer science is actually&nbsp;about:</p>
<blockquote>The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we
think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this
change is the emergence of what might best be called <em>procedural
epistemology</em> — the study of the structure of knowledge from an
imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of
view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Mathematics provides a
framework for dealing precisely with notions of “what is.” Computation
provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “how
to.”</blockquote>

<p>I’ve taken a view before about <a href="https://simondobson.org/2010/04/01/computer-microscope/">computers being the new
microscopes</a>, opening-up new science on their own as well as
facilitating existing approaches. The “how to” aspect of computer
science re-appears everywhere in this: in describing the behaviours of
sensor networks that can adapt while continuing the reflect the
phenomena they’ve been deployed to sense; in the interpretation of
large-scale data mined and mashed-up across the web; in capturing
scientific methods and processes for automation; and so forth. The
richness of these domains mitigates against packaged software and
encourages integration through programming languages like <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, so that the interfaces and
structures remain “soft” and open to&nbsp;experimentation.</p>
<p>When I looked at my copy, the date I’d written on the inside was
September 1988. So a book I bought nearly 22 years ago is still
relevant. <em> </em>In fact, I’d go further and say that it’s the only
computer science book of that age that I’d happily and usefully read
again without it being just for historical interest: the content has
barely aged at all. That’s not all that unusual for mathematics books,
but it’s almost unheard of in computer science, where the ideas move
so quickly and where much of what’s written about is ephemeral rather
than foundational. It goes to show how well <span>SICP</span> nailed the core
concepts. In this sense, it’s certainly one of the very few&nbsp; books on
computer science that it’s worth reading twice (or more). <span>SICP</span> is to
computer science what Feynman’s <em>Lectures on Physics</em> are to
physics: an accessible distillation of the essence of the subject
that’s stood the test of&nbsp;time.</p>
<p><span>UPDATED</span> 27Jan2024: This book also <a href="https://simondobson.org/2024/01/27/structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs/">appears</a>
in my <a href="https://simondobson.org/development/annotated-lisp-bibliography/">annotated

    </div><p>An international team of astronomers has discovered an instance of two galaxies aligned in a way where their gravity acts as a compound lens. The group has written a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04177" target="_blank">paper</a> describing the findings and posted it on the <i>arXiv</i> preprint server.</p>


										      
																					<p>Prior research has led to many findings of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/galaxies/" rel="tag">galaxies</a>, or clusters of them, bending light in ways that were predicted by Einstein's theory of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/general+relativity/" rel="tag">general relativity</a>. Astronomers have noted that some of them work as imperfect lenses, distorting the light behind them in interesting ways.</p>
<p>Some researchers have also noted that <a href="https://phys.org/tags/elliptical+galaxies/" rel="tag">elliptical galaxies</a> can serve as a lens, serving to brighten the light behind them. In this new effort, the research team has found, for the first time, two galaxies that align in a way that allows their gravity to work as a compound lens.</p>
<p>A compound lens, as its name suggests, is made up of two lenses. Those made artificially are cemented together and work to correct each other's dispersion. In the astronomical case, a compound lens can be made by the dual effects of two galaxies lined up next to one another just right.</p>
<p>The researchers note that when the system, J1721+8842, was first discovered, it was believed that there was just one elliptical galaxy bending the light from a quasar behind it. In analyzing data over a two-year period, the researchers of this new effort found variations in the quasar imagery. They also found small bits of light that, at first glance, appeared to be duplicates from a single source.</p>
<p>A closer look revealed that they matched the light from the main quartet of lights—a finding that showed that all six bits of light were from the same source. Prior research had suggested such an image could be the result of a natural compound lens.</p>
<p>When adding data from the James Webb Space Telescope, the team found that a reddish ring that was mixed with the other lights and was thought to be an Einstein ring was, in reality, a second lensing galaxy. The researchers next built a computer model and used it to confirm that the observation they had made was indeed that of a compound lens.</p>
<p>The research team expects the finding will allow other researchers to more precisely calculate the Hubble constant, perhaps leading to a resolution of conflict over its actual value.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-first_letter="I">
		<p>If you’ve already got a new M4 Mac and tried to run a macOS virtual machine on it, then you might have been disappointed. It seems that M4 chips can’t virtualise any version of macOS before 13.4 Ventura. So before you trade in or pass on your M1, M2 or M3 Mac, if you need access to older VMs, you might like to check whether this affects you.</p>
<p>I’m indebted to Csaba Fitzl for drawing my attention to this problem, and for reporting it to Apple in Feedback FB15774587. It has also been reported as <a href="https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues/6794" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affecting UTM</a>, and I believe affects all other macOS virtualisation software for Apple silicon.</p>
<h4>The bug</h4>
<p>Running a macOS VM for any version before 13.4 Ventura on an M4 Mac results in a black screen, and the VM fails to boot. This is true whatever settings are used in the virtualiser, even if it’s set to boot the VM in Recovery mode. It’s also true when that VM has been built on that Mac: although that appears to complete successfully, when first run that VM opens as a black screen and never proceeds with personalisation and setup.</p>
<p>Currently the only way to run a VM with macOS prior to 13.4 Ventura is to do so on a host with an M1, M2 or M3 chip.</p>
<h4>Can this be fixed?</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, as this bug prevents the VM from booting, there’s no reliable way to access its log to discover what’s going wrong there. There’s no sign of the failure in the host’s log either: the host appears to initialise its Virtio and other support normally, without errors or faults. After those, virtualisation processes on the host fall silent as they wait for the VM to start, which never happens.</p>
<p>There is a useful clue in Activity Monitor, though: in its CPU pane, despite being allocated multiple virtual cores, only one is seen to be active on the host. That implies the failure is occurring before the VM kernel boots the other cores, an event that occurs early during the kernel boot phase. Until that point, pre-boot phases and the kernel run on just a single CPU core.</p>
<p>macOS 13.4 updated iBoot to version 8422.121.1, so at first sight the VM could be failing when running older firmware. That doesn’t appear likely, as version 8422.121.1 was also installed in the 12.6.6 security update, so 12.7.x shouldn’t suffer this problem, but it does.</p>
<p>It thus appears most likely that this bug strikes in the early part of kernel boot, in which case the most feasible solution would be to fix the bug in macOS kernels prior to 13.4, and promulgate new IPSW image files for those. I suspect that’s very unlikely to happen, and as far as I’m aware it would be the first time that Apple has issued revised IPSWs.</p>
<h4>Which macOS can you virtualise?</h4>
<p>Support for lightweight virtualisation of macOS on Apple silicon Macs was still in progress in the first version of macOS to run on M1 chips, Big Sur. You therefore cannot create or run Big Sur VMs.</p>

<p>The first versions that can run in VMs are macOS 12 Monterey, although prior to 12.4 they can sometimes be a bit fractious. They also have major limitations, such as not supporting shared folders with the host.</p>

<p>macOS Sonoma should run even better on all current Apple silicon Macs, and delivers a much improved display with autoscaling. However, 14.2 and 14.2.1 don’t automatically support shared folders because of a bug that was fixed in 14.3.</p>

<p>macOS Sequoia is fully compatible, and adds support for iCloud Drive and some other Apple Account features, although still won’t run App Store apps. It may also fail to install the required extras to support Apple Intelligence.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<ul>
<li>Currently, M4 Macs can only run VMs of macOS Ventura 13.4 and later, 14 Sonoma, and 15 Sequoia.</li>
<li>M1, M2 and M3 Macs can run VMs of macOS Monterey 12.0.1 and later.</li>
<li>macOS Big Sur 11 can’t be virtualised on Apple silicon.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Postscript</h4>
<p>I’m grateful for the suggestion that it might be possible to work around this problem by running the older VM on a single core. Although I did manage to do that on an M3 (the first time I have seen recent macOS running on just <em>one</em> core!), that fails just the same on an M4, I’m afraid.</p>

Each screen sits inside wood panel cabinetry which folds out to provide a desk in front of it. People are sitting at all the desks, playing video games.

Two panels below this one swing outwards to form supports for the left and right sides of the desk. The monitor is on a retractable mount such that it can be pulled away from the wall, closer to the user. There is a power outlet behind the monitor, suitable for charging a phone while sitting at the station.">

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="who-designed-it">Who designed and built it?</h3>

        <p>The lead architect was <b>Richard Varda</b>, Kenton's father. Rich is an accomplished architect who has designed everything from houses to skyscrapers. Among other things, he designed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Centre">The Kingdom Centre</a> in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/181955/musical-instrument-museum-rsp-architects">The Musical Instrument Museum</a> in Phoenix, Arizona. Rich was also VP of Architecture at Target for many years.</p>

        <p>Many features of the house were designed directly by Kenton and Jade. For example, Kenton designed the game station cabinetry, office conference table, cat shelves, conduit routing, and most technical features of the house.</p>

        <p>Additionally, we worked with Thom Lasley and others at <a href="https://rsparch.com/">RSP Architects</a>. RSP normally does commercial buildings, not houses, but Rich was working with RSP on other projects at the time and had known Thom for decades, so it made sense.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.bluehorse.build/">Blue Horse Building &amp; Design</a> was our general contractor who built the house.</p>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="when-was-it-built">When was it built?</h3>

        <p>The house was completed in late 2023. We originally bought the property in 2019, and began construction in mid-2021. Yeah, it took a while.</p>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="who-made-this-site">Who made this site?</h3>

        <p>This site was designed and coded by Kenton with photos taken by Kenton, Jade, and Rich. We are neither web designers nor photographers. That's why the design is weird and the photos are kinda meh. Nothing on this site is sponsored.</p>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="didnt-someone-do-this-already">Didn't someone else do this already? Like a decade ago?</h3>

        <p>Yes, someone did. Specifically, me (Kenton)! In 2011 I completed <a href="https://kentonshouse.com/">a LAN-party optimized house in Palo Alto, California</a>, and it went viral. It, too, was in collaboration with my father (but I had not yet met Jade).</p>

        <p>But contrary to what most people think upon seeing the pictures, the original LAN house was not very big: 1400 sqft. This made for a pretty awesome bachelor pad, but would have been a bit cramped for raising a family. The new house is much, much better.</p>

        <p>I've never heard of anyone else having done anything like this. This surprises me! But, surely, if someone else did it, someone would have told me about it? If you know of another, please let me know!</p>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="why-austin">Why did you move to Austin?</h3>

        <p>In 2019, my team at Cloudflare was growing. But, most of the hiring was happening in the Austin office, while I worked from San Francisco. Meanwhile, with our first child on the way, Jade and I needed a bigger house, but we really could not afford to buy (much less build) anything bigger in Palo Alto.</p>

        <p>I suggested to Jade: Should we move to Austin? Jade initially said no, because she wanted our kids to benefit from Palo Alto's school district. At the time, it was rated #12 in the nation. But, looking closer at the rankings revealed a surprise: The Eanes school district in Austin was #8. When I showed this to Jade, she changed her mind.</p>

        <p>Ironically, just after we moved, covid hit, and Cloudflare became 100% remote. The original reason for the move—being closer to my team—became moot. In retrospect, we could have gone anywhere! Not that there's anywhere in particular that I think would have been better. It's just funny.</p>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="cost">How much did this cost?</h3>

        <p>The 22 game machines (including monitors, cables, and peripherals) cost about $75,000 in total. The house overall was a 7-digit number. Sorry, I'm not comfortable being any more specific than that.</p>

        <p>I actually find it funny how cheap computers are. The cabinetry around the game stations cost a similar amount to the computers powering them. Think about that! The cabinetry is just a bunch of wood, cut into fairly large pieces. Maybe a few screws and hinges. Whereas the computers in total contain <i>more than a trillion transistors</i>, each of which had to be carefully etched in the right spot connected correctly to all the others. A trillion! That's 1,000,000,000,000!</p>

        <p>Of course, the point is, GPUs are mass-produced. Cabinets for game stations in LAN-party-optimized houses are, um, not.</p>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="where-did-you-get-the-money">Where did you get the money?</h3>

        <p>This question also makes me uncomfortable, but I know from last time that people will ask it, and if I don't answer, people will make things up. So, OK, I will tell you.</p>

        <p>I (Kenton) started my career at Google in 2005, which was a pretty good time to be there, even as a junior engineer. They gave me stock, and that stock went up. With no family and no hobbies aside from video games, money piled up in my bank account. After 4-5 years of saving, I was able to make a $200k down payment on a $1M construction loan (later converted into a mortgage). In many places that could have bought a mansion, but in Palo Alto it got me a tiny sliver of land and a 1400 sqft house. Still, I considered myself rich.</p>

        <p>Then things got weird. The success of Google, Facebook, and others in Silicon Valley had produced a large number of people in the area with a lot of money, ready to buy houses and start families. Meanwhile, NIMBY policies were blocking all new development. As a result, Palo Alto housing prices, already high, went bonkers over the course of the 2010's. My house, which had cost me $1M, became worth over $2M.</p>

        <p>This is absolutely unfair! I built the house so that I could throw parties and play video games with my friends. These do not seem like activities that are supposed to make money. But it made me <i>a million dollars</i> in profit. What?</p>

        <p>So basically, we were able to parlay that into a bigger house in Austin. And just in time! While Austin housing prices had been growing for a while, they really exploded after 2020. We bought our property in late 2019. (Aside: Today, in 2024, Austin housing prices are now actually declining rapidly, due to an enormous amount of new housing having been built over the last few years. Yes, it can be done! Now is a great time to move to Austin!)</p>

        <p>For completeness, I'll mention two other not-insignificant sources of money. First, Jade and I joined Cloudflare in 2017, a couple years before its IPO. This was a good time to join. The stock has done very well, even hitting a high point just as we started construction. Second, Jade has long been an active (albeit small-scale) seed-stage investor in startups. Before she met me, she invested in Matterport, in their very first funding round. They went on to become a public company. We were already in the process of moving to Austin before either Cloudflare or Matterport went public, so we didn't have any idea at the time how much they'd pay off. But they did, and this allowed us to expand scope.</p>

        <p>Yes, we are very lucky!</p>

      <h2 id="about-lan-parties">About LAN Parties</h2>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="whats-a-lan-party">What's a LAN party?</h3>

        <p>It's where everyone goes to one place and plays multiplayer videogames with each player having their own computer, connected over a Local Area Network.</p>

        <p>In the 90's, when internet connections were bad, LAN parties were popular among PC gamers. But when broadband got decent in the early 2000's, LAN parties largely died off, as people could now play multiplayer games without leaving the house.</p>

        <p>But I think that sucks. For me, LAN parties were never just about the game. LAN parties are a social event, and the game is merely a catalyst. LAN parties serve very much the same purpose as normal parties serve for normal people, but the game makes it easier and more fun for introverts to be social. Indeed, LAN parties are so fun that they traditionally go all night long—much longer than your normie parties—because no one wants to stop.</p>

        <p>My (Kenton's) first LAN party was for my 14th birthday, in 1996. We had four computers: a 486sx 25Mhz, a 486dx 33Mhz, a 486dx2 50Mhz, and a Pentium 120Mhz. We played Doom 2 all night long. It was the most fun I'd ever had.</p>

        <p>That same year, I had another LAN party on New Year's Eve, which I have done every year since. At least two out of three (and usually all three) of my junior high friends from Minneapolis have attended every single time.</p>

        <p>In total, I have hosted or attended probably over 100 LAN parties. All of them were at someone's house, typically with 8-16 people. I have never been interested in big commercial LAN parties with hundreds of attendees—at that point it feels no different than playing with randos on the internet.</p>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="but-games-dont-support-lan">How can you have LAN parties when no games support LAN anymore?</h3>

        <p>We have an internet connection.</p>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="why-build-in">Dragging over your own computers is part of the fun of LAN parties. Why build them in?</h3>

        <p>I originally thought this too. In fact, my first LAN party house was designed to let people bring their own box and quickly connect it to a station. But nobody ever did. Not once. Some people brought laptops, but they only ever used them if the game stations were all in use already.</p>

        <p>I do feel a lot of nostalgia for the days of trying to pack four people, four computers, and four monitors into one car on the way to a friends' LAN party, setting up machines on haphazardly arranged card tables with questionable seating arrangements, daisy-chaining power strips and network hubs. I'm a little less nostalgic for the experience of trying to copy game files over the network to get everyone on the same version, or pitying the one friend who inevitably has to reinstall Windows and doesn't manage to get in-game until after midnight.</p>

        <p>The fact is that, while these things were fun, they were <a href="https://www.rei.com/blog/climb/fun-scale">Type II fun</a>. And they made LAN parties inaccessible. Even the most enthusiastic of us didn't really want to do all that more than, like, 3-4 times a year, and a lot of people—even those who like games—really don't care to do it at all. I'm not even sure if I could do it anymore, as a 40-something with two kids!</p>

        <p>With computers built-in and set up in advance, we can commence gaming essentially immediately upon enough people arriving. We can get a lot more people to participate. If someone can only drop by for an hour or two, they can still play. And we can do it all much more often: at one point I was hosting LAN parties every other weekend.</p>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="what-games">What games do you play?</h3>

        <p>Lots of things. We are trying new games all the time.</p>

        <p>In general, we prefer cooperative games, or at least team games. Most attendees are not actually hardcore gamers, so skill levels vary widely. In a free-for-all competitive game, one or two people tend to dominate while several can't get anywhere—that's not fun. Cooperative games allow everyone to participate according to their ability. Team competitive games allow us to carefully balance the teams, though this can be tricky.</p>

        <p>Our favorite LAN game of the past five years is probably Deep Rock Galactic, in which the players are a team of space dwarves mining an alien planet for resources. Prior to Deep Rock, Left 4 Dead 2 served the same purpose, or TF2 Mann vs. Machine mode.</p>

        <p>We have also played quite a few survivalcraft basebuilder games, such as Ark or Factorio.</p>

        <p>We played a lot of Overwatch, back when it was good, often with us on a team against internet randos, and occasionally team-vs-team entirely within the house.</p>

        <p>We still play Unreal Tournament 2004 regularly, usually in Assault or Onslaught mode.</p>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="are-they-public">Are your parties open to the public?</h3>

        <p>No. Sorry, you must be invited. I'm sure you understand: For security reasons, we can't just let random people on the internet into our house.</p>

        <p>If you want to get invited, you need to figure out some way to get to know one of us, or one of our friends who can vouch for you.</p>

        <p>One straightforward (albeit not easy) way to get an invite is to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/careers/jobs/">get hired at Cloudflare</a>. ;)</p>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="buying-games">Do you buy the games for every computer?</h3>

        <p>No. Everyone logs into their own Steam/Epic/etc. accounts, and must buy the game we are playing. We do, however, try to preinstall everything people might play. Fortunately, Steam and similar game launchers are able to use the same copy of the game for all users.</p>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

      <h2 id="about-the-tech">About the tech</h2>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="keeping-them-updated">How do you keep 20 computers up-to-date? That sounds tedious!</h3>

        <p>I don't! I maintain a single disk image for all the machines. Before the party starts, I will install all needed games and updates on that single disk image. The machines all boot off of a network drive based on this image. Each machine gets a copy-on-write overlay on top of the main image, so that guests can make changes to their machine which won't be seen by any other, and will be deleted at the end of the party.</p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/kentonv/lanparty">I have put all the scripts I use for this up on GitHub.</a></p>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="hardware-loadout">What exact hardware is in the game machines?</h3>

        <p>For the game machines, I mostly targeted the <a href="https://www.logicalincrements.com/">Logical Increments</a> "Outstanding" level, which aims to stay just under the inflection point where high-end price gouging sets in. To that end:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>CPU:</b> Intel Core i5-13600KF — <i>Games care much more about GPU than CPU.</i></li>
          <li><b>CPU heat sink:</b> Scythe Fuma 3 — <i>Mostly chosen because it fits in a 4U chassis while the Noctua fans do not.</i></li>
          <li><b>GPU:</b> Gigabyte Windforce RTX 4070 — <i>Not super, not Ti, just 4070</i></li>
          <li><b>Motherboard:</b> Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Master — <i>I do not recommend the motherboard! I was aiming to get the cheapest board that had 10G network on-board. The only reason I needed 10G network was because of the netboot setup: these machines access their primary storage entirely over the network. Otherwise, you absolutely do not need 10G for gaming. In general, I think expensive motherboards are a scam: they often provide no real benefit, but are marked up just because some suckers will buy them. Moreover, this particular motherboard is horribly unstable, frequently blue-screening shortly after boot. (Luckily, it seems to settle down after a minute or two and rarely disrupts actual games.)</i></li>
          <li><b>RAM:</b> Corsair Vengeance 32GB (2x16GB) DDR5 5600 — <i>Every time I see "Corsair Vengeance" I can't help but chuckle. Vengeance??? It's just computer memory, dude.</i></li>
          <li><b>PSU:</b> Corsair SF750 — <i>Platinum efficiency rating actually kinda matters when you're running 20 of them.</i></li>
          <li><b>Storage:</b> Corsair MP700 Gen5 1TB NVMe — <i>The storage is not actually used due to the netboot setup, but my hope is eventually to improve the design such that the copy-on-write overlay can be on local disk instead of server-side, using this storage.</i></li>
          <li><b>Chassis:</b> Rosewill RSV-L4500U 4U — <i>Realistically if you're rack-mounting consumer-grade hardware you have to go with a 4U chassis. I really tried to make 2U or even 3U work. It doesn't work.</i></li>
          <li><b>RGB:</b> None</li>
          <li><b>Incredibly long DisplayPort &amp; USB cables:</b> Monoprice SlimRun</li>
          <li><b>Monitor:</b> Corsair Xeneon 32UHD144 (32" 4k 144Hz)</li>
          <li><b>Keyboard:</b> Logitech K120 Wired — <i>The world's cheapest keyboard at $13 a pop. Works perfectly fine for all gaming needs.</i></li>
          <li><b>Mouse:</b> Logitech M500s Wired — <i>A cheap 5-button mouse. Unfortunately I've found the middle button is difficult to use without accidentally scrolling. I miss the old MX518.</i></li>
          <li><b>Sound bar:</b> Soulion R30 Wired — <i>This is just some crap I found on Amazon without doing a lot of research, but they seem to work fine. Unfortunately the monitors don't have built-in speakers, but this sound bar is probably better than a typical built-in speaker, so in the end I'm happy with it.</i></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Also, in case you are wondering:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Game room TV:</b> Samsung 98" QLED 4K Q80C</li>
          <li><b>Living room TV:</b> Samsung 85" "The Frame" QLED 4K LS03B</li>
          <li><b>Workstation monitor:</b> Samsung 57" Odyssey Neo G9 Dual 4K — <i>Ironically, I use this for work, not games. It's great for coding. Playing games on it gives me vertigo.</i></li>
          <li><b>Dance Pads:</b> L-TEK Ex Pro X</li>
        </ul>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="cable-latency">How long are the cables? Do they add latency?</h3>

        <p>The long DisplayPort and USB cables range from 35 to 100 feet, depending on the specific location. All cables are Monoprice SlimRun, which are fiber optic. The speed of a signal in fiber optic cable is about 2/3 the speed of light, and light travels at about 1 foot per nanosecond, so 100 feet of fiber would add about 150ns of latency. Thats 0.00015ms. Wheras at 144Hz, you see one frame per 7ms. In other words, no, the cable length does not add any meaningful latency. (For what it's worth, signal propagation in copper cables is similarly fast, but high-bandwidth signals in copper tend to degrade more quickly over long distance.)</p>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="why-not-vms">Why not use thin clients and one beefy machine running a lot of VMs?</h3>

        <p>Frankly, it would cost more, perform worse, and I'm not even sure how to set it up. Games are resource-intensive. A high-end game will fully utilize the machine's GPU, CPU, and RAM, so there's no real efficiency to be gained by packing more players onto fewer machines. If you wanted to put four players on one machine—if the software even exists to make it work—you'd need a machine with 4x the cores, 4x the RAM, and probably four separate GPUs. To do that you have to dive into "enterprise" hardware that gets extremely expensive. Building four separate machines is actually cheaper, and doesn't require any special virtualization layer.</p>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="other-home-automation">What home automation tech do you use?</h3>

        <p>Generally, I try to avoid any cloud-dependent home automation.</p>

        <p>For security cameras, we use UniFi Protect. I am very happy with these. They will reliably wake me up if a human approaches my house in the middle of the night, with very few false positives.</p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/kentonv/kvmonitor">I wrote my own baby monitor</a> that simply combines the audio from two UniFi cameras placed near my kids' beds and makes the stream available via a web page. I like it much better than the off-the-shelf monitors we were using before!</p>

        <p>I intend to set up Home Assistant eventually, but haven't gotten around to it yet.</p>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="electric-bill">Is your electric bill enormous?</h3>

        <p>Yes, but not because of the computers. The computers are off most of the time; I only turn them on for parties. Most of our energy usage goes to heating and cooling. We have efficient heat pumps and solar panels, but it's still a disturbing amount of energy usage and something I'm trying to debug. Perhaps we have too many windows letting in too much sunlight...</p>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

      <h2 id="misc-qa">Miscellaneous other questions</h2>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="skeptical-hvac-contractor">Any funny contractor reactions?</h3>

        <p>We had a subcontractor designing the HVAC system. I told him that there needed to be a dedicated air conditioner for the server rack. He sort of rolled his eyes and said sure.</p>

        <p>Later, when I got the design, there was no AC for the server rack. We had a conversation:</p>

        <p><b>Me:</b> Where's the AC for the server rack? We really do need AC in there.</p>
        <p><b>Him:</b> I mean, how many servers do you have?</p>
        <p><b>Me:</b> Well, if all the machines are running at full power playing a high-fidelity game, they could be consuming 15kW of power and turning it all into heat.</p>
        <p><b>Him:</b> (skeptical) That would be by far the largest server rack we've ever seen in a residential setting.</p>
        <p><b>Me:</b> I would expect so, yes.</p>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="cat-doors">Tell me more about cat doors.</h3>

        <p>Our philosophy with the cat doors is that we want to be able to close our bedroom doors while still allowing cats to enter. If we locked our cat out of our bedroom, he would meow all night long, and worse, we wouldn't get cuddles. But, leaving the bedroom door open sacrifices privacy. Solution: Cats get their own doors.</p>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="how-often-do-you-ddr">Just how often do you play Dance Dance Revolution that it justifies built-in pads?</h3>

        <p>Pretty often! I try to exercise most days and alternate between DDR, biking, and swimming. Of these, DDR really has the best fun/work and work/time ratios. Jade plays, too. I've been playing for over 20 years but my skill plateaued a while ago at "not quite competitive" levels...</p>

        <video controls="" poster="https://lanparty.house/images/ddr-video-poster.jpg" preload="none">
          <source src="https://video.lanparty.house/ddr.webm" type="video/webm">
          <source src="https://video.lanparty.house/ddr.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>

        <!--=============================================================================-->

        <h3 id="ddr-4player">Wait you have four DDR pads? Is that supported?</h3>

        <p>There are some obscure versions of DDR, and an old unofficial build of Stepmania, that supports four pads. I haven't actually gotten around to trying them yet, but I intend to at some point, and if I end up having to make my own Stepmania fork, so be it. I've been thinking about an algorithm to convert "doubles" step charts into "quads", where one person uses all four pads.</p>

As a result, unlike Timex’s watch ring that <a href="https://timex.com/products/timex-x-mm6-20mm-stainless-steel-ring-watch-m-l-tw2w81400">features a stretchable band</a> to accommodate different users, the CRW-001-1JR is permanently a US size 10.5. If your fingers are smaller than that, Casio includes a couple of spacers to improve the fit. If your fingers are larger than that, you’ll need to find some other way to check the time.</p><p>Last year, Casio <a href="https://www.g-central.com/casio-to-release-casio-watch-ring-collection-capsule-toys/#google_vignette">released a collection of ring watches</a> featuring designs inspired by some of the company’s most iconic digital timepieces from the past 50 years. Unfortunately, none of them were functional, so it’s nice to see Casio following up with a ring watch that actually works. For the 75th anniversary, maybe we’ll even get a tiny calculator ring watch.</p></div></div>]]></description>

    </div><p>The largest trial of its kind in the U.K. has shown how a low-cost, structured, anti-bullying program can improve social dynamics in primary schools and reduce victimization.</p>


										      
																																	<p>The year-long trial of the KiVa school based bullying prevention program was implemented in more than 100 <a href="https://phys.org/tags/primary+schools/" rel="tag">primary schools</a> in England and Wales and involved more than 11,000 students. It significantly reduced incidents of bullying and was equally effective across socio-economically diverse schools and from small rural schools to large, urban ones.</p>
<p>The project was led overall by Bangor University working with the Universities of Exeter, Oxford, Warwick, and Birmingham and the trial itself was managed by the Center for Trials Research, Cardiff University. The Children's Early Intervention Trust charity, that has the UK KiVa dissemination license, organized intervention costs, training schools and implementation.</p>
<p>The "KiVa" program focuses on the behavior of all children and emphasizes the role that bystanders can play. Children in schools that implemented the program were 13% less likely to report being bullied, compared to schools using standard procedures. The schools undertaking KiVa also reported that their children were more empathetic towards victims and that children's problems with their peers were reduced.</p>
<p>Economic analyses by public health economists from Bangor University found that KiVa is also a low-cost intervention, which is particularly important given budget restrictions in schools.</p>
<p>Lucy Bowes, Professor of Psychopathology at the University of Oxford's Department of Experimental Psychology, said, "Being bullied may have devastating consequences for children and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/young+people/" rel="tag">young people</a>, including increasing the risk of mental health difficulties such as anxiety or depression, as well as poor school outcomes.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>"This means that any improvement is worthwhile and even small percentage changes can have a substantial impact for those individual children and will cumulatively improve the situation in the school over time.</p>
<p>"The Finnish data show year-on-year improvements over seven years for schools that continue with the program. Addressing bullying in schools is a major public health concern, and evaluating anti-bullying programs used in our schools is vital."</p>
<p>Professor Judy Hutchings, from the Center for Evidence Based Early Intervention at Bangor University, said, "Bullying in childhood is one of the biggest risk factors for later mental health problems in childhood, adolescence and beyond. Unfortunately, it is widespread in U.K. schools; and while all schools are required to have a bullying policy, it's rarely evidence-based.</p>
<p>"The KiVa 'whole school' approach has had really significant effects on bullying in other countries because it focuses on everyone's behavior, and removes the social rewards usually gained by the perpetrators."</p>
<p>The Finnish Kiusaamista Vastaan ("Against Bullying"), or KiVa, program, is based on research that demonstrates that bystanders—children who are present, but not directly involved in bullying incidents—have a major role to play in defending the victim, making bullying less socially acceptable, and so reducing the motivation of bullies.</p>
<p>The research is the largest randomized controlled trial to date of the KiVa program outside Finland, involving 118 schools across England and Wales. Half the schools adopted Kiva and half continued standard practice.</p>

																																			<p>Data were obtained from 11,111 pupils who filled in surveys about bullying, and from teacher-reported pupil behavior questionnaires on 11,571 pupils, both before and after the trial. The trial ran for a full academic year. However, KiVa is designed to be embedded into ongoing school practice and many schools involved in the trial are continuing to use the program.</p>
<p>The schools on the KiVa arm of the trial set up fortnightly lessons for pupils which focused on recognizing and responding to bullying and helping to support victims. There were also whole-school assemblies on bullying, poster campaigns and information for parents. Teachers supervising breaktimes wore high-visibility vests.</p>
<p>For every identified bullying incident, staff followed KiVa's recommended actions. Rather than the traditional response of blame and punishment for the bully, the schools had individual discussions with the children involved and made sure that the bullying pupil committed to clear actions to support the victim.</p>
<p>The results from the UK trial of 13% reduction in bullying are less compelling than those from earlier studies in other European countries. However, the U.K. trial took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, which involved major classroom disruption for pupils and considerably higher levels of absenteeism, and researchers believe this may have affected the results.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>YC recently released their latest </span><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs-build" rel="">Request for Startups</a><span>, and one specific item has already been getting some buzz in chip design communities. It’s exciting that an organization as high-profile as YC is taking chip design more seriously… or at least it’s exciting until you actually start reading what their proposal is. Unfortunately, YC seems to have fundamentally misunderstood the key challenges in the world of chip design, and where both LLMs and AI tools more broadly can help.</span></p><p>YC makes the following argument:</p><blockquote><p>Design of customized digital systems [...] has typically been costly because of the amount of custom design, development and testing necessary to bring such a system online. With the advent of large language models, these costs are coming down significantly, such that ever more specialized types of computation could be done.</p><p>We know there is a clear engineering trade-off: it is possible to optimize especially specialized algorithms or calculations such as cryptocurrency mining, data compression, or special-purpose encryption tasks such that the same computation would happen faster (5x to 100x), and using less energy (10x to 100x).</p></blockquote><p><span>If Gary Tan and YC believe that LLMs will be able to design chips 100x better than humans currently can, they’re significantly underestimating the difficulty of chip design, and the expertise of chip designers. While LLMs are </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10424v4" rel="">capable</a><span> of writing </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07544" rel="">functional Verilog</a><span> </span><em>sometimes</em><span>, their performance is still subhuman. More importantly, LLMs aren’t capable of designing novel chip architectures, which is the primary driver of performance improvements for modern accelerator chips. LLMs primarily pump out mediocre Verilog code.</span></p><p><span>The more charitable version of YC’s proposal is that LLM-based tools will significantly reduce the </span><em>cost</em><span> of chip design, which will make hardware acceleration more viable for applications where it’s currently cost-prohibitive. Unfortunately, the semiconductor industry already tried something similar. It was called high-level synthesis, and it resoundingly failed.</span></p><p><span>High-level synthesis, or HLS, was born in 1998, when </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forte_Design_Systems" rel="">Forte Design Systems</a><span> was founded. They developed a tool called Cynthesizer, which could automatically translate SystemC to Verilog given certain timing constraints. More generally, HLS tools let engineers write code in a higher-level language like C, C++, or Scala, and automatically convert that code to Verilog, which can in turn be synthesized into logic gates for ASICs and FPGAs. The idea is to make silicon development cheaper and more accessible, especially for teams that don’t have access to deep Verilog expertise.</span></p><p><span>Despite Cynthesizer’s cool name, it never really caught on. Forte was still </span><a href="https://www.eetimes.com/the-future-is-high-level-synthesis/?_ga" rel="">desperately trying to argue</a><span> that HLS was the future in 2011. In 2014, they were acquired by Cadence, and Cynthesizer was rolled into Cadence’s new HLS tool, Stratus.</span></p><p><span>Xilinx, now AMD, has been a major proponent of HLS, specifically targeting FPGA acceleration. This makes some sense, as FPGA development is usually done on smaller teams where the additional firepower HLS promises could be super useful. Their </span><a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/adaptive-socs-and-fpgas/vitis/vitis-hls.html" rel="">Vitis</a><span> tool is one of the best HLS tools in the industry -- unfortunately, that’s a bit of a low bar.</span></p><p><span>The current state of HLS is best summed up by Lan Huang in the </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11390-020-9414-8" rel="">introduction to his survey of the current state-of-the-art in HLS tools</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>The performance of HLS tools still has limitations. For example, designers remain exposed to various aspects of hardware design, development cycles are still time consuming, and the quality of results (QoR) of HLS tools is far behind that of RTL flows.</p></blockquote><p><span>Other researchers have reported </span><a href="https://trepo.tuni.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/126643/Are_We_There_Yet.pdf?sequence=1" rel="">similar disappointing results</a><span> in their own surveys. </span></p><p>Ultimately, while HLS makes designers more productive, it reduces the performance of the designs they make. And if you’re designing high-value chips in a crowded market, like AI accelerators, performance is one of the major metrics you’re expected to compete on. So it makes sense to spend the additional upfront cost to hire talented RTL designers, build chips with better performance, and deliver more successful products.</p><p>So HLS tools failed to gain any traction for high-value, high-volume chips, where performance and efficiency requirements necessitated human engineers writing high-quality Verilog. LLMs, which also produce poor-quality Verilog, will likely face the same challenges But what about other kinds of chips? Could LLMs help there?</p><p>The few successful applications of HLS enabled engineers without silicon expertise to leverage hardware acceleration. For example, HLS has seen success in FPGA acceleration of genomics workloads and CFD workloads.</p><p>In both cases, HLS is valuable because the engineers developing the hardware accelerators don’t have the RTL experience to build optimized RTL-level designs from scratch. But this is only the case because the markets for hardware-accelerated genomics and CFD are relatively small. GPUs already serve these use cases somewhat well, and neither use-case would drive even a fraction of the sales volume of AI chips or cryptographic accelerators. If these markets were bigger, it would make economic sense to dedicate talented hardware engineers to build optimized silicon.</p><p><span>The idea that YC is proposing falls into the same trap. LLMs can reduce the cost to develop silicon. This might make dedicated ASICs for applications like genomics economically viable, when they previously weren’t. But they weren’t viable for a reason: there isn’t a huge market there. Ultimately trying to leverage LLMs to build hardware accelerators for underserved applications is a loser’s bet.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-151675193" href="https://www.zach.be/p/yc-is-wrong-about-llms-for-chip-design#footnote-1-151675193" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> If an application doesn’t warrant hardware acceleration yet, it’s probably because it’s a small market, and that makes it a poor target for a startup.</span></p><p>If LLM-based chip design primarily unlocks low-value markets, why are so many startups and established EDA companies trying to leverage LLMs? Well, it turns out that LLMs are also pretty valuable when it comes to chips for lucrative markets -- but they won’t be doing most of the design work. LLM copilots for Verilog are, at best, mediocre. But leveraging an LLM to write small snippets of simple code can still save engineers time, and ultimately save their employers money.</p><p>More importantly, though, the chip design world is experiencing a massive talent shortage in verification. Normally, you want two verification engineers for every designer, because silicon bugs are incredibly costly. But in the modern era, good verification engineers are hard to come by.</p><p><span>If you could leverage LLMs to make verification faster, easier, or more effective, that could be massively valuable to established semiconductor companies and semiconductor startups alike. But actually ensuring that LLMs can actually understand and reason about chip designs specifications is no small task, which is why I’m skeptical of startups like </span><a href="https://www.bronco.ai/" rel="">Bronco</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.getinstachip.com/" rel="">Instachip</a><span> who are naively throwing fine-tuned LLMs at chip verification.</span></p><p><span>First of all, chip specifications are often complex, incomplete, labyrinthine monstrosities -- they were written by people like me, after all. But more importantly, successful verification of a chip requires an LLM to understand the expected internal state of the chip. In essence, the language needs to have some formal model of the chip: think </span><a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/" rel="">AlphaProof</a><span>, but for semiconductor verification instead of math. This is one of the things we’re working on at </span><a href="https://www.normalcomputing.com/" rel="">Normal Computing</a><span>, alongside our novel thermodynamic chip architectures.</span></p><p>Ultimately, LLMs will make chip design cheaper. But this will primarily benefit three kinds of companies: large semiconductor companies who can reduce their verification workforce, conventional chip startups who can operate leaner teams, and then the EDA software startups selling LLM-based tools. LLMs won’t build 100x better chips, or enable hardware startups to tackle markets lacking hardware acceleration, because the economics just don’t make sense.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

        <p>Yggdrasil is a new experimental compact routing scheme. It is designed to be a future-proof and decentralised alternative to the structured routing protocols commonly used today on the Internet, as well as an enabling technology for future large-scale mesh networks. Yggdrasil is:</p>

<p>The <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/implementation.html">current implementation</a> of Yggdrasil is a lightweight userspace software router which is easy to configure and supported on a wide range of platforms. It provides end-to-end encrypted IPv6 routing between all network participants. Peerings between nodes can be configured using TCP/TLS connections over local area networks, point-to-point links or the Internet. Even though the Yggdrasil Network provides IPv6 routing between nodes, peering connections can be set up over either IPv4 or IPv6 networks.</p>

<p>This is still an alpha-stage project and there may be some breaking changes in the future. Despite that, Yggdrasil is generally stable enough for day-to-day use and a small number of users have been using and stress-testing Yggdrasil quite heavily for a variety of use cases. If you are interested in or would like to get involved in the Yggdrasil project, start below:</p>
