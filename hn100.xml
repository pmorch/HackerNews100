            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://sethpurcell.com/writing/screens-in-museums/">https://sethpurcell.com/writing/screens-in-museums/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45199931">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>When I was a kid in the ’80s, one of my two favorite places on Earth was <a href="https://fi.edu/en">The Franklin Institute</a> (TFI) in downtown Philadelphia. We lived a couple hours away so a visit was a rare and precious thing. I think I only visited two or three times but it left an indelible impression on me. I remember wandering in amazement through its enormous spaces getting to <em>actually play with</em> amazing and interesting things. I remember sweeping off a table and then filling an overhanging funnel pendulum with sand, setting it going, and watching it create unexpected patterns on the table. I remember running through the gigantic model heart with other kids. I remember the overpowering joy of being in an actual monumental marble temple of curiosity and fascination. So I was filled with anticipation a couple weeks ago when, during a family trip to the East Coast, we managed to squeeze in a visit to TFI with our six-year-old son.</p>
<p>We parked and ran in, paid close to <em>ninety bucks</em> (ouch! but I love you, so take my money), and started off on the top floor with the Wondrous Space exhibit.</p>
<p>And were met with screens.</p>
<p>Design your own rocket! it said (or something like that). No, I thought, this isn’t designing a rocket, this is playing a lame video game on a touchscreen. Yes, there were space-related artifacts around the walls, and a spacesuit in its own large case, but you couldn’t <em>touch</em> any of this stuff, you couldn’t <em>play with it</em>, you could just look at it for a few seconds, read the placard, say “huh”, and maybe point out some interesting feature to the kiddo.</p>
<p>But the screens were given pride of place, dead center in the dimly-lit space. And so they beckoned. My wife —&nbsp;a science writer who used to be the only staff writer covering space for New Scientist and before that, worked at NASA — poked at one of these with my son, added too many boosters to their launch vehicle, and were told it failed “for reasons” in a way she found totally unhelpful and pointless. She led our son gently but firmly away to the glorious four-story Foucault pendulum which hangs in a stairwell.</p>
<p>Here are some images from the <a href="https://fi.edu/en/exhibits-and-experiences/wondrous-space">website</a> showing patrons interacting with (or running past) screens so you can see what I’m talking about:</p>
<p><img src="https://sethpurcell.com/images/Pasted%20image%2020250908092440.png" alt="" title="What are they interacting with? Screens, of course."></p>
<p><img src="https://sethpurcell.com/images/Pasted%20image%2020250908092857.png" alt="" title="Another screen. Kids love screens!"></p>
<p><img src="https://sethpurcell.com/images/Pasted%20image%2020250908093454.png" alt="" title="Here are some screens in slick circular frames!"></p>
<p>But the screens were all over the place. There were on the main floor, in another section of Wondrous Space, and in the Body Odyssey exhibit. They were all over the SportsZone exhibit on the top floor. Many of them are connected to body motion sensors a la Xbox Kinect so you don’t need to touch them, but they’re still just video games, where the action-response feedback loop is provided by software, not the <em>universe itself</em>.</p>
<p>And the wonderful hands-on physical stuff that I loved as a kid? Jammed into out-of-the-way spaces in the Sir Isaac’s Loft and Air Show rooms. These rooms are terrific, and I was delighted to see they were absolutely packed with kids playing with stuff. No screens, just objects and forces — you don’t even need to read anything to enjoy many of the exhibits, such as the one where you sit in one of two chairs hanging from different configurations of block-and-tackle and haul yourself up — and then just let yourself drop, cushioned by a damping piston. Tucked far away in a desolate corner by a hallway we discovered an engaging exhibit where you pluck rods with your finger to generate Lissajous curves from the vibrations. My son was fascinated; he had never seen anything behave like that. And in the Air Show room he liked many of the exhibits, like the one where you (apparently) evacuate a cylinder to see the effect that has on objects moving through it (versus a control). And the “shimmer wall”, where kids generate sound waves using a variety of devices and can then see the sound waves <em>impacting</em> on a reflective and reactive surface was wonderful and really conveys the mechanical nature of sound.</p>
<p>But these physical exhibits require maintenance, and I was dismayed to see that several are in bad repair; some of them weren’t even <em>working</em> anymore, some seemed worn out, or didn’t seem well-designed to begin with. For instance, they have the classic “bicycle wheel and rotating stool” gyro effect demonstration, but the wheel was too large a diameter for my son to hold, and the stool seemed to have too much friction to work properly for my wife. There was no one trying to use it before or after us; I’d be curious to see the data on how many visitors attempt it, and how well it usually works for them. And that one should be trivial to design and implement properly: for crying out loud, our local ice cream shop has stools that spin on ball bearings, and I think that would be a big improvement. Every time something didn’t work right I couldn’t help thinking: we paid almost ninety bucks to visit this place. TFI doesn’t seem poor; it seems like its budgetary priorities lie elsewhere.</p>
<p>And where it looks like the budget has been going are the screen rooms. They occupy the huge central spaces on the main floor of the museum, and I’m sure a lot of time, money, and passion went into these things. But it’s misguided.</p>
<p>I believe museums exist to present the <em>real thing</em> for the visitor to experience with their own senses. Here’s the sculpture — the actual piece of stone, two thousand years old, Greek sculptor unknown —&nbsp;now go ahead and form your impressions. Come back to it when you’re an old man or woman, it will still be here, and you will see it with different eyes. This is a tiny but, to me, beautiful part of the human condition. And what made the Franklin Institute so amazingly special to me as a kid was that the exhibits sat at the intersection of things that kids want to play with, things that kids <em>are allowed to play with</em>, and things that demonstrate some “hey, that’s cool!” scientific phenomenon. And it was all <em>real</em>.</p>
<p>But a lame video game? I can do that on my goddamn <em>phone</em>. TFI “was one of the first museums in the nation to offer a hands-on approach to learning about the physical world”, but — and I can’t emphasize this enough, it’s my whole reason for writing this — touchscreens <em>are not actually hands-on</em>. Digital representations aren’t tangible, and touchscreen experiences just don’t activate a kid’s brain (including, I’d say, a sense of delight) the same way a genuinely hands-on experience, like pulling hard on a rope to raise your chair, does.</p>
<p>I don’t know why museums are doing this; my idle speculation is that they see themselves as competing with screens for attention, so in a kind of experiential race to the bottom, they feel compelled to bring screens into their exhibits (see: <em>Amusing Ourselves to Death</em>). But now more than ever in history, <em>kids need a break</em> from the screens that all too many of them are sadly often plugged into by default, and connection to the real world instead. <strong>Now is the time for TFI — and all museums — to take a stand against the tidal wave of digital garbage that is consuming humanity, especially kids, by eliminating all of their touchscreen “exhibits”.</strong></p>
<p>To be fair, TFI is still pretty damn great if you just ignore all the screens. The Franklin Memorial rotunda (free to visit!) is gorgeous. The hands-on stuff, tucked away and apparently suffering from neglect though it is, should be replicated in every city in the world. But it would be so much better if they removed all the screens and put that budget and real estate toward the real, tangible, interactive science exhibits that were the reason the museum was created in the first place, and what made me love it as a child.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

While Congress fixates on TikTok’s data collection usages, what hasn’t received enough attention is how the platform has successfully industrialized human attention itself. Where earlier media relied on polished narratives (films with arcs, shows with seasons), TikTok turned culture into a never-ending feedback loop of impulse and machine learning.</p><p>TikTok didn’t invent short videos or algorithmic feeds, though. Vine created looping six-second clips in 2013, YouTube has used recommendations for over a decade, Instagram rolled out Stories in 2016, and MTV conditioned audiences to rapid cuts long before any of them. What TikTok did was fuse these scattered experiments into a full-scale system for harvesting attention.&nbsp;</p><p>Most platforms’ “For You” pages are far less finely tuned. They adjust slowly, learning from signs like likes, follows, or finished videos. TikTok's algorithm learns instantly from micro-behaviors. You can nuke your feed in minutes just by deliberately watching only one type of video—say, pottery clips or capybara memes. That’s because the algorithm heavily weights engagement signs per video rather than long-term user profiles. Public documentation and leaked papers suggest TikTok may also track micro-behaviors such as how long users hover before swiping away. This results in a recommender system that feels uncannily perceptive.</p><p>However, before today, each medium we’ve invented reshaped how we think and consume information. The printing press trained readers in linear, sequential thought, encouraging sustained focus and complex argumentation. Television created visual storytelling and shared cultural moments, with families watching the same shows at the same time and building collective references. The internet introduced hyperlinked thinking, enabling rapid information switching, comparison of perspectives, and knowledge-building through exploration.</p><p>Now, the world is picking up on the TikTok model.</p><p>News organizations like The Washington Post have invested in and expanded a dedicated TikTok team since 2019, producing short and snappy newsroom videos that regularly go viral. In education, students are struggling with assignments longer than a few minutes and expect information delivered in rapid, visually engaging bursts. In entertainment, traditional stand-up comedy builds tension over minutes before a punchline, but TikTok comedians deliver the absurd immediately — a person discovering their roommate has been using their toothbrush as a cleaning brush — and increasingly structure shows around "clippable moments" designed to go viral. Song introductions have shortened dramatically, with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/apr/14/songs-getting-shorter-thanks-part-spotify-tiktok-algorithms/?ref=thenexus.media#"><u>one study</u></a> finding average intros fell from more than 20 seconds in the 1980s to just five, while movie trailers increasingly resemble TikTok compilations: rapid-fire montages of action sequences and emotional beats rather than traditional narrative setups.</p><p>Cultural consumption itself has also become a form of algorithmic training. Instead of browsing Netflix and choosing what to watch, users scroll TikTok to see what the algorithm predicts. This means that you're not consuming culture; you're teaching a machine how to feed you culture more efficiently.</p><p>TikTok also rewards hyper-specialization. Entire followings are built on carpet-cleaning videos, paint-mixing shots, or the same dance repeated in new locations. Success comes less from broad talent or universal appeal than from perfecting a narrow niche optimized for the algorithm. In other words, creators who identify and double down on the smallest engagement signals are algorithmically incentivized to specialize, turning micro-content into a precise science of attention capture. This hyper-optimization emerged in markets where dozens of apps competed brutally for user attention. Platforms that kept people engaged survived; the rest died. That evolutionary pressure produced increasingly sophisticated ways to capture attention, and the most successful apps learned to treat human psychology like an engineering problem to be solved through data and iteration.</p><p>As American platforms adopt TikTok-style optimization, the format sets expectations for all digital content. Micro-optimization techniques are spreading worldwide, establishing a new standard for how human attention is structured algorithmically. TikTok delivers exactly what we want: immediate satisfaction, personalized content, and endless novelty. But efficiency always involves trade-offs. We gain instant access to exactly the content that triggers our reward systems, but we lose the ability to be bored, to sit with incomplete thoughts, to wrestle with ideas that don't immediately pay off. We lose the serendipity of discovering things we didn't know we wanted.</p><p>Are we making this trade consciously? Most users have never considered that their scrolling patterns are training an algorithm, or that their entertainment has been optimized for maximum psychological grip rather than maximum meaning.</p><p>The irony, of course, is that if you've read this far, it may mean you’ve already mastered a rare skill: sustained attention in a world of distraction.</p><p><em>Subscribe to get weekly insights on China's tech culture that Western media misses.</em></p>

        </header>

        <p>Dear Zettlers,</p>

<p>This scam is decades old now and it is quite surprising that people still fall for it.</p>

<p>The search engines, old note-taking apps (you know, those with an elephant icon and the like) and AI have something in common: They claim that the effort of remembering things is outdated like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VuePDTgSDo">using a candle in the age of electric light</a>.</p>

<p>The following is, by the way, from my Zettelkasten (2016):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To find what you need online, you require a solid general education and, above all, prior knowledge in the area related to your search.<sup id="fnref:spitzer2012"><a href="#fn:spitzer2012" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Original in German:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Was man braucht, um im Netz fündig zu werden, ist eine solide Grundbildung und vor allem Vorwissen in dem Bereich, in dem sich die Suche bewegt.  <br>
—Manfred Spitzer, Digitale Demenz<sup id="fnref:spitzer2012:1"><a href="#fn:spitzer2012" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Culturally, it is increasingly the case that the first step is to go online, search for the a desired end result of a thinking process instead of engaging in learning. This means that we are using the internet less and less to our advantage, because we have less and less prior knowledge: We detrain ourselves out of the ability to access the quality of the information and turn it into actual knowledge.</p>

<p>Rowlands et al. wrote about the so called “digital natives” that they lack the critical and analytical thinking skills to evaluate the information they find on the internet.<sup id="fnref:rowlands2008"><a href="#fn:rowlands2008" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> We need a fully developed mental map of the subject in order to derive value from the results of an internet search.</p>

<p>In short: You need a trained brain to actually benefit from the internet.</p>

<p><strong>The advertised benefits of all these tools come with a specific hidden cost: Your ability to think.</strong></p>

<p>Let’t take a closer look at the digital natives, since this issue is more accessible. They put themselves in a situation in which there is a vastly reduced incentive structure to evaluate the information critically. They use surface level indicators if the information matches the request. This behaviour has some obvious effects (in hindsight):</p>

<ol>
  <li>The reduced engagement with the material reduces the emotional weight of the whole line of action. You mind is an engine that is fuelled by emotion. Without any emotion, you don’t think. Rather, you try to imitate thinking efficiently.</li>
  <li>The more you interact with information being emotionally disengaged and keeping it on the surface level, the more you develop the habit to engage with information in a way that it doesn’t change your brain.</li>
</ol>

<p>So the more you work in a superficial way, the more brittle the knowledge foundation in your mind will be on which you base your cognitive actions.</p>

<p>This drives us to one of the most important conclusions of the entire field of note-taking, knowledge work, critical thinking and alike: <em>You</em>, not AI, not your PKM or whatever need to build the knowledge because only then it is in your brain and you can go the next step.</p>

<p>Let me try to give you a demonstration of the issue:</p>

<p>I asked ChatGPT to design an optimal weekly training schedule for health span and fitness. This is the answer:</p>

<p>Here’s a table outlining the optimal weekly workout schedule for <strong>health span and longevity</strong> based on the assumption that you should focus on <strong>aerobic capacity</strong>, <strong>muscle strength</strong>, <strong>mobility/flexibility</strong>, and <strong>neuromuscular coordination</strong>:</p>

<p>Looks good alright? Or does it? How do you know? You can’t if you don’t have sufficient background knowledge. Here is a little quiz if you have the sufficient background knowledge:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How do volume and intensity factor in strength gains?</li>
  <li>What is the difference between aerobic capacity and aerobic power?</li>
  <li>How do you weigh each minute spend on flexibility against the minutes spent on aerobic capacity and strength?</li>
</ol>

<p>If you can’t produce a comprehensive answer <em>with confidence and on the whim</em> the second you read the question, you don’t have the sufficient background knowledge.</p>

<p>“I just ask ChatGPT for that, too!”, the AI generation might ask. Ok, and then what? How can you assess the answers to those three questions (which represent only a fraction of needed knowledge!)?</p>

<p>What is going wrong? You are taking on an impossible task, because you can’t use enough of your brain for your cognitive operations. Assuming that you have no comprehensive knowledge in health and fitness, terms like “aerobic capacity” or “core stability” only activate some superficial level associations. But if you are deeply involved with the topic the term “aerobic capacity” activates <em>way more</em>. Here are some examples (just a small fraction):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two discussions of Olaf Alexander Bu on the difference between capacity and power numbers in measuring endurance performances.</li>
  <li>A mental map on the aerobic metabolism.</li>
  <li>The tension between peripheral endurance improvements (like mitochondrial biogenesis) central improvements (like improved cardiac output) and their connection (like angiogenesis)</li>
  <li>The still ongoing discussion between low intensity exercise and high intensity exercise as the best tool to build aerobic capacity for the non-professional athlete.</li>
  <li>The differences between running, cycling, rowing and all the other movements to build aerobic capacity.</li>
  <li>An open task to review a paper on interval length that you found in “Textbook of Work Physiology” by Astrand and Rodahl.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a small fraction of what I can observe in my mind and there is a lot more going on unconsciously. Now consider that I might be very well-read in the domain of health and fitness. But multiply this by a factor of 100 if you replace me with an expert like Olaf Alexander Bu when it comes to the term “aerobic capacity”.</p>

<p>In knowledge work the bottleneck is not the external availability of information. It is the internal bandwidth of processing power which is determined by your innate abilities and the training status of your mind.</p>

<p>So, coming back to the initial starting point that “you don’t have to remember anything”. <em>The opposite is true.</em></p>

<p><strong>You have to remember EVERYTHING.</strong> Only then you can perform the cognitive tasks necessary to perform meaningful knowledge work.</p>

<p>The way you train your mind is the way your mind can perform. Simple tools like spaced repetition allow your mind to perform simple tasks, complex tools like the Zettelkasten Method allow your mind to master complex tasks. Remember my mantra of depth of processing? Perhaps, you can rephrase it to train your mind for depth.</p>

<p>The field of knowledge work will not advance if we don’t come to terms that we can’t circumvent the work needed to train our minds.</p>

<p>Live long and prosper  <br>

			<p>A bridge from 2001 to today, with no game code changes required.</p>

		<p>
			Animal Crossing. Infamous for its charming but ultimately repetitive dialogue. Having picked up the GameCube classic again, I was shocked (/s) to discover that the villagers still say the same things they did 23 years ago. Let's change that.
		</p>
		<p>
			The problem? The game runs on a Nintendo GameCube, a 24-year-old console with a 485 MHz PowerPC processor, 24MB of RAM, and absolutely no internet connectivity. It was fundamentally, physically, and philosophically designed to be an offline island.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is the story of how I built a bridge from 2001 to today, making a vintage game console talk to a cloud-based AI without modifying a single line of the original game's code.
		</p>

		<h2>The First Hurdle: Speaking to the Game 🗣️</h2>
		<p>
			My first stroke of luck was immense. The week I started this project, a massive effort by the Animal Crossing decompilation community reached completion. Instead of staring at PowerPC assembly, I had access to readable C code.
		</p>
		<p>
			Digging through the source, I quickly found the relevant functions under a file named <code>m_message.c</code>. This was it, the heart of the dialogue system. A simple test confirmed I could hijack the function call and replace the in-game text with my own string.
		</p>

		<p>C: A glimpse into the decompiled dialogue system</p>
		<pre><code>// A glimpse into the decompiled Animal Crossing source code
// The function that changes message data in the dialogue system.
// My initial entry point for hijacking the text.

extern int mMsg_ChangeMsgData(mMsg_Window_c* msg_p, int index) {
    if (index &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; index &lt; MSG_MAX &amp;&amp; mMsg_LoadMsgData(msg_p-&gt;msg_data, index, FALSE)) {
        msg_p-&gt;end_text_cursor_idx = 0;
        mMsg_Clear_CursolIndex(msg_p);
        mMsg_SetTimer(msg_p, 20.0f);
        return TRUE;
    }
    
    return FALSE;
}
</code></pre>

		<p>
			Easy win, right? But changing static text is one thing. How could I get data from an external AI into the game in real time?
		</p>
		<p>
			My first thought was to just add a network call. But that would mean writing an entire network stack for the GameCube from scratch (TCP/IP, sockets, HTTP) and integrating it into a game engine that was never designed for it. That was a non-starter.
		</p>
		<p>
			My second thought was to use the Dolphin emulator's features to write to a file on my host machine. The game would write a "request" file with context, and my Python script would see it, call the LLM, and write back a "response" file. Unfortunately, I couldn't get the sandboxed GameCube environment to access the host filesystem. Another dead end.
		</p>

		<h2>The Breakthrough: The Memory Mailbox 📬</h2>
		<p>
			The solution came from a classic technique in game modding: Inter-Process Communication (IPC) via shared memory. The idea is to allocate a specific chunk of the GameCube's RAM to act as a "mailbox." My external Python script can write data directly into that memory address, and the game can read from it.
		</p>

		<div>
			<p>
				graph TD
					A[Python Script] -- "Writes LLM response" --&gt; B{Memory Mailbox @ 0x81298360}
					B -- "Game reads new dialogue" --&gt; C[Animal Crossing on Dolphin Emulator]
					C -- "Writes current speaker &amp; context" --&gt; B
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>Python: The core of the "Memory Mailbox" interface</p>
		<pre><code># This is the bridge. These functions read from and write to GameCube RAM via Dolphin.
GAMECUBE_MEMORY_BASE = 0x80000000

def read_from_game(gc_address: int, size: int) -&gt; bytes:
    """Reads a block of memory from a GameCube virtual address."""
    real_address = GAMECUBE_MEMORY_BASE + (gc_address - 0x80000000)
    return dolphin_process.read(real_address, size)

def write_to_game(gc_address: int, data: bytes) -&gt; bool:
    """Writes a block of data to a GameCube virtual address."""
    real_address = GAMECUBE_MEMORY_BASE + (gc_address - 0x80000000)
    return dolphin_process.write(real_address, data)
</code></pre>

		<p>
			This was the path forward. But it created a new, painstaking task: I had to become a memory archaeologist. I needed to find the exact stable memory addresses for the active dialogue text and the current speaker's name.
		</p>
		<p>
			To do this, I wrote my own memory scanner in Python. The process was a tedious loop:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Talk to a villager.</b> The moment their dialogue box appeared, I'd freeze the emulator.</li>
			<li><b>Scan.</b> I'd run my script to scan all 24 million bytes of the GameCube's RAM for the string of text on screen (e.g., "Hey, how's it going?").</li>
			<li><b>Cross-Reference.</b> This often returned multiple addresses. So, I'd unfreeze, talk to a different villager, and scan for their name to figure out which memory block belonged to the active speaker.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			After hours of talking, freezing, and scanning, I finally nailed down the key addresses: <code>0x8129A3EA</code> for the speaker's name and <code>0x81298360</code> for the dialogue buffer. I could now reliably read who was talking and, more importantly, write data back to the dialogue box.
		</p>

		<h2>What About the GameCube Broadband Adapter? 🌐</h2>
		<p>
			Yes, the GameCube had an official Broadband Adapter (BBA). But <i>Animal Crossing</i> shipped without networking primitives, sockets, or any game-layer protocol to use it. Using the BBA here would have required building a tiny networking stack and patching the game to call it. That means: hooking engine callsites, scheduling async I/O, and handling retries/timeouts, all inside a codebase that never expected the network to exist.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Engine hooks:</b> Hijack safe points in the message loop to send/receive packets.</li>
			<li><b>Driver/protocol:</b> Provide a minimal UDP/RPC interface over BBA.</li>
			<li><b>Robustness:</b> Handle timeouts, retries, and partial reads without stalling animations/UI.</li>
		</ul>
		<div>
			<p>
				graph LR
					subgraph Option A: BBA Network Shim
						AC[Animal Crossing] --&gt; Hooks[Net Shim Hooks]
						Hooks --&gt; BBA[BBA Driver]
						BBA --&gt; LAN[(LAN)]
						LAN --&gt; Host[Host Bridge Server]
					end
					subgraph Option B: RAM Mailbox
						AC2[Animal Crossing] --&gt; Mailbox[RAM Mailbox]
						Mailbox --&gt; Py[Python Watcher]
						Py --&gt; LLM[LLM]
					end
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			I chose the RAM mailbox because it's deterministic, requires zero kernel/driver work, and stays entirely within the emulator boundary, with no binary network stack needed. That said, a BBA shim is absolutely possible (and a fun future project for real hardware via Swiss + homebrew).
		</p>

		<p>C: Minimal RPC envelope for a hypothetical BBA shim</p>
		<pre><code>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

/* Minimal RPC envelope for a hypothetical BBA shim */
typedef struct {
    uint32_t magic;    // 'ACRP'
    uint16_t type;     // 1=Request, 2=Response
    uint16_t length;   // payload length
    uint8_t  payload[512];
} RpcMsg;

int ac_net_send(const RpcMsg* msg);         // sends via BBA
int ac_net_recv(RpcMsg* out, int timeoutMs); // polls with timeout
</code></pre>

		<p>Python: Host-side UDP bridge (very simplified)</p>
		<pre><code>import socket, json
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
sock.bind(("0.0.0.0", 19135))
while True:
    data, addr = sock.recvfrom(2048)
    msg = json.loads(data.decode("utf-8", "ignore"))
    # ... call Writer/Director LLMs ...
    reply = json.dumps({"ok": True, "text": "Hi from the cloud!"}).encode()
    sock.sendto(reply, addr)
</code></pre>

		<h2>Speaking the Game's Secret Language 🤫</h2>
		<p>
			I eagerly tried writing "Hello World" to the dialogue address and... the game froze. The character animations kept playing, but the dialogue wouldn't advance. I was so close, yet so far.
		</p>
		<p>
			The problem was that I was sending plain text. Animal Crossing doesn't speak plain text. It speaks its own encoded language filled with control codes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Think of it like HTML. Your browser doesn't just display words; it interprets tags like <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> to make text bold. Animal Crossing does the same. A special prefix byte, <code>CHAR_CONTROL_CODE</code>, tells the game engine, "The next byte isn't a character, it's a command!"
		</p>
		<p>
			These commands control everything: text color, pauses, sound effects, character emotions, and even the end of a conversation. If you don't send the <code>&lt;End Conversation&gt;</code> control code, the game simply waits forever for a command that never comes. That's why it was freezing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once again, the decompilation community saved me. They had already documented most of these codes. I just needed to build the tools to use them.
		</p>
		<p>
			I wrote an encoder and a decoder in Python. The decoder could read raw game memory and translate it into a human-readable format, and the encoder could take my text with custom tags and convert it back into the exact sequence of bytes the GameCube understood.
		</p>
		<p>Python: A small sample of the control codes I had to encode/decode</p>
		<pre><code># A small sample of the control codes I had to encode/decode
CONTROL_CODES = {
    0x00: "&lt;End Conversation&gt;",
    0x03: "&lt;Pause [{:02X}]&gt;",        # e.g., &lt;Pause [0A]&gt; for a short pause
    0x05: "&lt;Color Line [{:06X}]&gt;",  # e.g., &lt;Color Line [FF0000]&gt; for red
    0x09: "&lt;NPC Expression [Cat:{:02X}] [{}]&gt;", # Trigger an emotion
    0x59: "&lt;Play Sound Effect [{}]&gt;",  # e.g., &lt;Play Sound Effect [Happy]&gt;
    0x1A: "&lt;Player Name&gt;",
    0x1C: "&lt;Catchphrase&gt;",
}

# The magic byte that signals a command is coming
PREFIX_BYTE = 0x7F
</code></pre>

		<p>
			With my new encoder, I tried again. This time, I wasn't just sending text. I was speaking the game's language. And it worked. The hardest part of the hack was done.
		</p>

		<h2>Building the AI Brain 🧠</h2>
		<p>
			With the communication channel established, it was time for the fun part: building the AI.
		</p>
		<p>
			My initial approach was to have a single LLM do everything: write dialogue, stay in character, and insert the technical control codes. The results were a mess. The AI was trying to be a creative writer and a technical programmer simultaneously and was bad at both.
		</p>
		<p>
			The solution was to split the task into a two-model pipeline: a <b>Writer</b> and a <b>Director</b>.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>The Writer AI:</b> This model's only job is to be creative. It receives a detailed character sheet (which I generated by scraping the Animal Crossing Fan Wiki) and focuses on writing dialogue that is funny, in-character, and relevant to the context.</li>
			<li><b>The Director AI:</b> This model receives the pure text from the Writer. Its job is purely technical. It reads the dialogue and decides how to "shoot the scene." It adds pauses for dramatic effect, emphasizes words with color, and chooses the perfect facial expression or sound effect to match the mood.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This separation of concerns worked perfectly.
		</p>

		<div>
			<p>
				graph LR

						Dolphin(Dolphin Emulator)

		<h2>Emergent Behavior 🤪</h2>
		<p>
			First I piped in a lightweight news feed. Within minutes, villagers began weaving headlines into small talk, no prompts, just context.

			<figcaption>Mitzi: "About the news? European leaders are planning to meet with Trump and Zelenskyy!"</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>
			Then I gave them a tiny shared memory for gossip, who said what, to whom, and how they felt. Predictably, it escalated into an anti-Tom Nook movement.
		</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p id="first">NASA research has shown that cell-like compartments called vesicles could form naturally in the lakes of Saturn's moon Titan.</p><div id="text">
<p>Titan is the only world apart from Earth that is known to have liquid on its surface. However, Titan's lakes and seas are not filled with water. Instead, they contain liquid hydrocarbons like ethane and methane.</p>
<p>On Earth, liquid water is thought to have been essential for the origin of life as we know it. Many astrobiologists have wondered whether Titan's liquids could also provide an environment for the formation of the molecules required for life - either as we know it or perhaps as we <em>don't</em> know it - to take hold there.</p>
<p>New NASA research, published in the <em>International Journal of Astrobiology</em>, outlines a process by which stable vesicles might form on Titan, based on our current knowledge of the moon's atmosphere and chemistry. The formation of such compartments is an important step in making the precursors of living cells (or protocells).</p>
<p>The process involves molecules called amphiphiles, which can self-organize into vesicles under the right conditions. On Earth, these polar molecules have two parts, a hydrophobic (water-fearing) end and a hydrophilic (water-loving) end. When they are in water, groups of these molecules can bunch together and form ball-like spheres, like soap bubbles, where the hydrophilic part of the molecule faces outward to interact with the water, thereby 'protecting' the hydrophobic part on the inside of the sphere. Under the right conditions, two layers can form creating a cell-like ball with a bilayer membrane that encapsulates a pocket of water on the inside.</p>
<p>When considering vesicle formation on Titan, however, the researchers had to take into account an environment vastly different from the early Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Uncovering Conditions on Titan </strong></p>
<p>Titan is Saturn's largest moon and the second largest in our solar system. Titan is also the only moon in our solar system with a substantial atmosphere.</p>


<p>The hazy, golden atmosphere of Titan kept the moon shrouded in mystery for much of human history. However, when NASA's Cassini spacecraft arrived at Saturn in 2004, our views of Titan changed forever.</p>
<p>Thanks to Cassini, we now know Titan has a complex meteorological cycle that actively influences the surface today. Most of Titan's atmosphere is nitrogen, but there is also a significant amount of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>). This methane forms clouds and rain, which falls to the surface to cause erosion and river channels, filling up the lakes and seas. This liquid then evaporates in sunlight to form clouds once again.</p>
<p>This atmospheric activity also allows for complex chemistry to happen. Energy from the Sun breaks apart molecules like methane, and the pieces then reform into complex organic molecules. Many astrobiologists believe that this chemistry could teach us how the molecules necessary for the origin of life formed and evolved on the early Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Building Vesicles on Titan </strong></p>
<p>The new study considered how vesicles might form in the freezing conditions of Titan's hydrocarbon lakes and seas by focusing on sea-spray droplets, thrown upwards by splashing raindrops. On Titan, both spray droplets and the sea surface could be coated in layers of amphiphiles. If a droplet then lands on the surface of a pond, the two layers of amphiphiles meet to form a double-layered (or bilayer) vesicle, enclosing the original droplet. Over time, many of these vesicles would be dispersed throughout the pond and would interact and compete in an evolutionary process that could lead to primitive protocells.</p>
<p>If the proposed pathway is happening, it would increase our understanding of the conditions in which life might be able to form.</p>
<p>"The existence of <em>any</em> vesicles on Titan would demonstrate an increase in order and complexity, which are conditions necessary for the origin of life," explains Conor Nixon of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. "We're excited about these new ideas because they can open up new directions in Titan research and may change how we search for life on Titan in the future."</p>
<p>NASA's first mission to Titan is the upcoming Dragonfly rotorcraft, which will explore the surface of the Saturnian moon. While Titan's lakes and seas are not a destination for Dragonfly (and the mission won't carry the light-scattering instrument required to detect such vesicles), the mission will fly from location to location to study the moon's surface composition, make atmospheric and geophysical measurements, and characterize the habitability of Titan's environment.</p>

    <p>i wrote a piece earlier about <a href="https://www.varunraghu.com/why-i-wont-be-vibe-coding-anymore" target="_blank">why I won't be vibe coding anymore</a>.</p>
<p>i think of it less as vibe coding now, i kinda hate the term because it makes it seem like its not an involved process. it is very involved, and you can't just vibe it.</p>
<p>all of the different tools selling the dream of building your own $1bn startup from just simple prompting are fooling people. yes all of them. trust me i've tried most of these tools.</p>
<p>you can't fool people into thinking they can build a smartphone or a car with little effort - but somehow you can trick people into thinking they can build a world-class software product that makes millions with little to no effort. this is a scam.</p>
<p>at first i was very hopeful i can finally 'build' now with my minimal tech skills. after months of trying out different platforms, countless prompts, and hundreds of dollars spent - i've come to the conclusion that it's simply not possible. these tools merely give you the illusion that you can code.</p>
<p>only thing i use cursor for now is to make cosmetic changes to my landing page. that is because i'm pretty good at frontend and design. It's a skill i already have. i just use AI to speed up the process.</p>
<p>will these ai coding tools get better? will i finally be able to actually vibe code products? maybe. but right now the whole industry is running a scam and pulling a big fat one on all of us.</p>

<p id="caption-attachment-38130">Histology image of a patient whose metastatic cancer went into complete remission after receiving a new immunotherapy treatment (Ravetch lab)</p>
</div>
<p>Over the past 20 years, a class of cancer drugs called CD40 agonist antibodies have shown great promise—and induced great disappointment. While effective at activating the immune system to kill cancer cells in animal models, the drugs had limited impact on patients in clinical trials&nbsp;and caused dangerously systemic inflammatory responses, low platelet counts, and liver toxicity, among other adverse reactions—even at a low dose.</p>
<p>But in 2018, the lab of Rockefeller University’s Jeffrey V. Ravetch <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1810566115" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrated</a> it could engineer an enhanced CD40 agonist antibody so that it improved its efficacy and could be administered in a manner to limit serious side effects. The findings came from research on mice, genetically engineered to mimic the pathways relevant in humans. The next step was to have a clinical trial to see the drug’s impact on cancer patients.</p>
<p>Now the results from the phase 1 clinical trial of the drug, dubbed 2141-V11, have been <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2025.07.013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> in <em>Cancer Cell</em>. Of 12 patients, six patients saw their tumors shrink, including two who saw them disappear completely.</p>
<p>“Seeing these significant shrinkages and even complete remission in such a small subset of patients is quite remarkable,” says first author Juan Osorio, a visiting assistant professor in Ravetch’s <a href="https://lab.rockefeller.edu/ravetch/">Leonard Wagner Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and Immunology</a> and a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.</p>
<p>Notably, the effect wasn’t limited to tumors that were injected with the drug; tumors elsewhere in the body either got smaller or were destroyed by immune cells.</p>
<p>“This effect—where you inject locally but see a systemic response—that’s not something seen very often in any clinical treatment,” Ravetch notes. “It’s another very dramatic and unexpected result from our trial.”</p>
<p><strong>Engineering enhancements</strong></p>
<p>CD40 is a cell surface receptor and member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, proteins that are largely expressed by immune cells. When triggered, CD40 prompts the rest of immune system to spring into action, promoting antitumor immunity and developing tumor-specific T cell responses.</p>
<p>In 2018, Ravetch’s lab—which has been supported in this line of research by Rockefeller’s Therapeutic Development Fund, founded by trustee Julian Robertson and continued by the Black Family Foundation—engineered 2141-V11, a CD40 antibody that binds tightly to human CD40 receptors and is modified to enhance its crosslinking by also engaging a specific Fc receptor. It proved to be 10 times more powerful in its capacity to elicit an antitumor immune response.</p>
<p>They then changed how they administered the drug. The long-time approach had been to give it intravenously. But CD40 receptors are widespread, so too many non-cancerous cells pick it up, leading to the well-known toxic side effects. Instead, they injected the drug directly into tumors.</p>
<p>“When we did that, we saw only mild toxicity,” Ravetch says.</p>
<p>Those findings became the basis of the phase 1 clinical trial described in the current study, which aimed to determine a starting clinical dose of the drug and better understand the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Inducing remission</strong></p>
<p>The trial included 12 patients representing myriad metastatic cancer types: melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and different types of breast cancer. Of those 12, none suffered the serious side effects seen with other CD40 drugs. Six experienced systemic tumor reduction, of which two had a complete response—meaning their cancer disappeared entirely.</p>
<p>The two patients who experienced complete remission had melanoma and breast cancer, respectively—both notoriously aggressive and recurring.</p>
<p>“The melanoma patient had dozens of metastatic tumors on her leg and foot, and we injected just one tumor up on her thigh,” Ravetch says. “After multiple injections of that one tumor, all the other tumors disappeared. The same thing happened in the patient with metastatic breast cancer, who also had tumors in her skin, liver, and lung. And even though we only injected the skin tumor, we saw all the tumors disappear.”</p>
<p>Tissue samples from the tumor sites revealed the immune activity that the drug stimulated. “We were quite surprised to see that the tumors became full of immune cells—including different types of dendritic cells, T cells, and mature B cells—that formed aggregates resembling something like a lymph node,” Osorio says. “The drug creates an immune microenvironment within the tumor, and essentially replaces the tumor with these tertiary lymphoid structures.”</p>
<p>The presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) is associated with improved prognosis and response to immunotherapy, Osorio notes.</p>
<p>They also found TLS in the tumors they didn’t inject. “Once the immune system identifies the cancer cells, immune cells migrate to the non-injected tumor sites,” he says.</p>
<p><strong>Improving immunotherapy</strong></p>
<p>The findings have sparked a number of other clinical trials that the Ravetch lab is currently collaborating on with researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering and Duke University. Now in either phase 1 or phase 2 study, the trials are investigating 2141-V11’s effect on specific cancers, including bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and glioblastoma—all aggressive and hard to treat. Collectively, nearly 200 people are enrolled in the studies.</p>
<p>These studies will help to illuminate why some patients respond to 2141-V11 and others do not—and how to potentially change that.</p>
<p>For example, the two patients in the clinical trial whose cancer disappeared both had a high clonality of T cells—key cancer-cell killers—when they began the study. “This suggests there are some requirements from the immune system in order for this drug to work, and we’re in the process of dissecting these characteristics in more granular detail in these larger studies.”</p>
<p>“As a general rule, only 25 to 30% of patients will respond to immunotherapy, so the biggest challenge in the field is to try to determine which patients will benefit from it. What are the indicators or predictors of response? And how can we convert non-responders into responders?”</p>

    <p>Over the last twenty years, I have used over a dozen languages professionally, from C to Common Lisp, from Java to Python, from C++ to Typescript.</p>
<p>Yet, I love janky programming languages. In particular, I really enjoy PHP and Javascript.</p>
<p>Here's why.</p>
<h2 id="they-are-used-by-people-who-get-shit-done">They are used by people who get shit done.</h2><p>This makes it easy to find people who:</p>
<ul>
<li>understand business needs,</li>
<li>can iterate quickly</li>
<li>have shipped and maintained many projects in the past.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="there-is-a-lot-of-fud-that-has-been-cargo-culted-throughout-the-years">There is a lot of FUD that has been cargo-culted throughout the years.</h2><p>PHP8 is not your grandmother's PHP3, ECMAScript 12 is not your grandfather's Javascript.</p>
<p>Their ecosystems haven't stood still either.  Tools like CPAN, PECL, npm have put significant evolutionary pressure on other languages.  With its daily new paradigms and frameworks, Javascript has been a hotbed of innovation for years.</p>
<h2 id="their-quality-is-offset-by-other-factors">Their quality is offset by other factors.</h2><p>These languages are not popular for their elegance, but for other reasons.</p>
<p>These can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>speed</li>
<li>ease of deployment</li>
<li>malleability</li>
<li>tooling</li>
<li>community</li>
<li>frameworks</li>
<li>platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>PHP is a favorite of mine because of its cgi-bin model:</p>
<ul>
<li>legacy codebases can be refactored in pieces</li>
<li>resource leaks are non-existent</li>
<li>caching and scaling are simpler</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="they-are-fun">They are fun.</h2><p>Because basic areas of the language are problematic areas means that programming comes with a sense of experimentation. There is pleasure in finding ways to write elegant code in a language that doesn't prescribe any.</p>
<h2 id="janky-programming-languages-are-great-equalizers">Janky programming languages are great equalizers.</h2><p>Because they are quite permissive, they allow people of all levels and backgrounds to get started with programming. You can be a complete PHP beginner and get a real website going within days.</p>
<p>Having started by copy-pasting BASIC snippets and later on making my own websites with PHP2 and PHP3, I feel pride in being able to pay back by helping newcomers where they are.</p>
<p>Poo-poo-ing a 12-year-old or a recent BootCamp graduate because they are writing actual code is missing the point.</p>
<p>In fact, because users are builders and learners because they have diverse backgrounds, janky languages tend to have very active and welcome communities.</p>
<h2 id="i-never-had-issues-writing-good-code">I never had issues writing good code.</h2><p>PHP, Javascript, Lua, Perl all provide effective tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>functions</li>
<li>variables</li>
<li>classes</li>
<li>first-class functions</li>
<li>sometimes traits and prototypal inheritance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good software is:</p>
<ul>
<li>product alignment</li>
<li>software design</li>
<li>naming and design patterns</li>
<li>enforcing invariants through static analysis or unit testing</li>
<li>providing fast and effective feedback loops to developers</li>
<li>good team communication</li>
</ul>
<p>None of which depend on the language.</p>
<p>Javascript and PHP in particular come with:</p>
<ul>
<li>solid libraries</li>
<li>pragmatic static analysis tools</li>
<li>great IDE support</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, they have better tooling than many a "serious" programming language.</p>
<h2 id="i-love-legacy-codebases">I love legacy codebases.</h2><p>A legacy codebase means that the product is performing well. It means that I can often make immediate and impactful improvements.</p>
<p>For me, nothing comes close to the pleasure of improving a product with many users.</p>

Most recently</span><span>, the Trump administration has </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/18/business/bitcoin-crypto-rally-us-stocks" target="_blank">taken</a><span> on a pro-cryptocurrency stance, boosting blockchain’s </span>popularity and media prominence.</p><p><span><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cryptography">Cryptography</a> is central to the functioning of blockchains, whether for a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/decentralized-web">decentralized Web</a> or for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrencies</a>. Every time a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a> transaction is initiated, all parties involved in the transaction need to securely prove that they agree to the transfer. This is done via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature" target="_blank">digital signature</a>: a cryptographic protocol that generates a secret, private key that is unique to each user and a public key that the user shares. Then, the private key is used to generate a unique signature for each transaction. The public key can be used to verify that, indeed, the signature was created by the holder of the private key. In this way, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/web3">Web3</a> in every incarnation relies heavily on cryptography. </span></p><p><span>To learn more about the evolution of Web3, and cryptography’s role, we caught up with</span><span> </span><a href="https://wahby.net/" target="_blank">Riad Wahby</a><span>, assistant professor of electrical and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/computer-engineering">computer engineering</a> at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/carnegie-mellon-university">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, in Pittsburgh, and a cofounder and CEO of hardware-backed Web3 security platform </span><a href="https://cubist.dev/" target="_blank">Cubist</a><span>.</span></p><p><span> Wahby explained what Web3 was meant to be, what it’s become, and how hardware-backed cryptography will enable its future.<br></span></p><h3>Web3 Began as a Response to What Came Before</h3><p><strong><em>IEEE Spectrum</em>: What is Web3?</strong></p><p><strong>Riad Wahby:</strong> That’s the hardest question that you’re going to ask by far, because I don’t know how to answer it in a way that satisfies everyone.</p><p>The term Web3 was coined around 2014, by people who looked at the way that the Web had developed. Web 1.0 was the first Web bubble, the dot-com bubble. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/web-2-0">Web 2.0</a>, roughly speaking, is <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/google">Google</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a> and Apple and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/netflix">Netflix</a>, and the like. And the perception, especially from folks who originally coined this term Web3, was that these companies had basically taken the Web in the wrong direction, because your privacy is gone, and you’re the product, so to speak. You use <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gmail">Gmail</a> for free because Google is mining your emails to sell things like better advertising. Web3 was originally a reaction to this. Early proponents of Web3 basically said, “We don’t want that. We want to take back control of our stuff. I want to own my own data, and maybe cryptocurrencies and blockchains are the way there.” So that’s where the term originally came from.</p><p><strong>What does the term mean now?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Now it doesn’t mean anything like that at all. Now Web3 is the broader ecosystem around cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based technologies. And I think basically all of that revolutionary spirit has gone away in favor of building financial products and making a lot of money doing it. As far as I can tell, the term has really transformed from a reaction to a lack of privacy and a lack of sovereignty in my own data to “Hey, this is a technology that has something to do with blockchains.” Maybe you can buy some kind of speculative meme coin and make a bunch of money doing it. So I don’t know, maybe that took a dark turn at the end. That’s how things go.</p><p><strong>How are those two definitions connected?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Cryptography really fits into the revolutionary spirit, in the sense that the folks who want to cast off the chains of things like Google and Facebook, one of the tenets was—”The way that we’ll do that is we’ll build this technology that’s sort of amazing and that gives us all these great properties.” And they were going to do that using some advanced cryptographic technologies. This is the reason that there’s so many people who are cryptography researchers at universities that also are involved deeply in some kind of cryptocurrency. Because it’s like this is a sea change in the way that cryptography gets used in the world.</p><p>Twenty years ago, it used to be that if you were working on really any kind of cryptography, regardless of how theoretical or how practical you intended it to be, you knew that there was not much of a chance that any of it was going to get really used in the world, unless it was extremely practical and extremely focused on solving some immediate problem. And it just used to be the case that people were extremely conservative about what kind of cryptography they used. Basically, everyone thought, “We don’t need any of this crazy stuff. That’s all theory. Nobody cares. The only stuff we need is what lets you connect to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/amazon">Amazon</a> and safely buy stuff.” The rise of cryptocurrencies brought with it this whole shift in the way that cryptography gets deployed in the world, where now if you can come up with some interesting functionality that’s enabled by some advanced cryptography, probably somewhere somebody is going to try and turn that into a product that they can sell.</p><h3>Web3 Is Both Good and Bad for Cryptography</h3><p><strong>What effect has this had on the cryptographic community?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> It’s both good and bad. It’s good in that this means that there’s a lot of motivation to build interesting, cool stuff. And as a researcher in cryptography, I love it because it means that there’s tons more research money being poured into cryptography.</p><p>That’s the good side. The bad side is that the reason that people were so conservative about deploying new cryptography is that it’s easy to get the security mechanism wrong. The default state of cryptography is [to assume everything is] broken. You have to be very, very careful that each change that you make isn’t returning your cryptography to the default state. I’m not saying that people in Web3 aren’t careful. They are. It’s just by the nature of things, since it’s a much faster time frame, there’s much more pressure to just push stuff into production. And I think the downside is that we have seen a little bit of brokenness. It’s hopefully not causing people to lose oodles of money. And I think the historical record bears this out: People lose oodles of money because other people are really dishonest, not because the cryptography is broken for the most part. But the cryptography can also be broken, and that can also be worrisome. But I’d say from the perspective of somebody who’s doing research in cryptography, the impact of Web3 on the cryptographic community has generally been a good thing.</p><p><strong>Now you’re focused on <a data-linked-post="2667266794" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-titan-chip" target="_blank">hardware security</a>. Can you explain what that is?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> Any cryptocurrency has this property that if I hold some token, and I want to send it to somebody else, the way that I do that is by producing a digital signature that says, I want to spend this token. The secret key is what lets you generate a signature. So if you have 10 <a data-linked-post="2657850698" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-merge-heralds-cryptos-climate-friendly-future" target="_blank">E</a>TH [cryptocurrency coins], and they’re all protected by this key, and somebody takes a copy of your key, then life is bad.</p><p>With a digital signature key it could just be sitting on your hard drive, and then you get some <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/malware">malware</a>, and now somebody has silently stolen your key. There have been these big, broadly targeted malware campaigns where millions and millions of people have all had their keys stolen. So now the criminals are just like sitting there counting up all the money that they’ve stolen, and there’s no reversing transactions, unlike at a bank.</p><p>Here’s where hardware comes in. This is not really a Web3 technology, this is kind of old, good stuff. There are these devices called hardware security modules, and they’ve been used for multiple decades. This is a physical device, and this device can run certain cryptographic <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/algorithms">algorithms</a>. And it knows enough that when you tell it, “Hey, please generate me a key,” it can generate you a key securely. And when you tell it, “Please give me a signature,” it can give you a signature securely. But the important thing is the way that it’s designed, the key never leaves this piece of hardware. It turns what was a piece of data into a physical object. And we know how to secure a physical object.</p><p><strong>You’re working on extending hardware security for more use cases. Can you explain what you’re doing?</strong></p><p><strong>Wahby:</strong> There are two issues with the standard hardware security module.</p><p>No. 1, you need more cryptography support, so you need to be able to apply digital signatures to transactions very quickly if you’re actively trading. And No. 2, you need a way of expressing that it’s not just a key that can generate any signature. It’s a key that also has attached to it some kind of policy that says these are the kinds of signatures that are okay to generate, and everything else is not allowed, to add extra security. These are the two directions that we have that our technology enables within traditional hardware security modules.</p><p>We start with the security that’s provided by the traditional hardware security module, and we extend it using this, actually another piece of trusted hardware called the Trusted Execution Environment. We extend it to support the actual kinds of cryptography that are needed for Web3 and to support this rich programmable policy layer that lets you say, “This key is only intended for this specific kind of use,” or “anytime somebody tries to make a payment from this key, first I have to check whether the recipient is subject to sanctions,” or any other rule. So in the end, we have, not only a hardware security module, we have also this Trusted Execution Environment and this policy layer, and all this other cryptographic stuff that together gives us a hardware security module that’s really designed for the Web3 use case.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE) is the culmination of an unprecedented design and engineering effort, spanning half a decade, that combines the unique strengths of Apple silicon hardware with our advanced operating system security to provide industry-first, always-on memory safety protection across our devices — without compromising our best-in-class device performance. We believe Memory Integrity Enforcement represents the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems.</p>
<hr>
<p>There has never been a successful, widespread malware attack against iPhone. The only system-level iOS attacks we observe in the wild come from mercenary spyware, which is vastly more complex than regular cybercriminal activity and consumer malware. Mercenary spyware is historically associated with state actors and uses exploit chains that cost millions of dollars to target a very small number of specific individuals and their devices. Although the vast majority of users will never be targeted in this way, these exploit chains demonstrate some of the most expensive, complex, and advanced attacker capabilities at any given time and are uniquely deserving of study as we work to protect iPhone users against even the most sophisticated threats. Known mercenary spyware chains used against iOS share a common denominator with those targeting Windows and Android: they exploit memory safety vulnerabilities, which are interchangeable, powerful, and exist throughout the industry.</p>
<p>For Apple, improving memory safety is a broad effort that includes developing with safe languages and deploying mitigations at scale. (For a primer on how we think about memory safety, see the opening of <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/towards-the-next-generation-of-xnu-memory-safety#memorysafety">this post</a>.) We created Swift, an easy-to-use, memory-safe language, which we employ for new code and targeted component rewrites. In iOS 15, we introduced <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/towards-the-next-generation-of-xnu-memory-safety/">kalloc_type</a>, a secure memory allocator for the kernel, followed in iOS 17 by its user-level counterpart, xzone malloc. These secure allocators take advantage of knowing the type — or purpose — of allocations so that memory can be organized in a way that makes exploiting most memory corruption vulnerabilities inherently difficult.</p>
<p>In 2018, we were the first in the industry to deploy Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC) in the A12 Bionic chip, to protect code flow integrity in the presence of memory corruption. The strong success of this defensive mechanism in increasing exploitation complexity left no doubt that the deep integration of software and hardware security would be key to addressing some of our greatest security challenges. With PAC behind us, we immediately began design and evaluation work to find the most effective way to build sophisticated memory safety capabilities right into Apple silicon.</p>
<p>Arm published the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_summer19_03_serebryany.pdf">Memory Tagging Extension (MTE)</a> specification in 2019 as a tool for hardware to help find memory corruption bugs. MTE is, at its core, a memory tagging and tag-checking system, where every memory allocation is tagged with a secret; the hardware guarantees that later requests to access memory are granted only if the request contains the correct secret. If the secrets don’t match, the app crashes, and the event is logged. This allows developers to identify memory corruption bugs immediately as they occur.</p>
<p>We conducted a deep evaluation and research process to determine whether MTE, as designed, would meet our goals for hardware-assisted memory safety. Our analysis found that, when employed as a real-time defensive measure, the original Arm MTE release exhibited weaknesses that were unacceptable to us, and we worked with Arm to address these shortcomings in the new <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/109697/0100/Feature-descriptions/The-Armv8-9-architecture-extension?lang=en#md454-the-armv89-architecture-extension__FEAT_MTE4">Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE)</a> specification, released in 2022. More importantly, our analysis showed that while EMTE had great potential as specified, a rigorous implementation with deep hardware and operating system support could be a breakthrough that produces an extraordinary new security mechanism.</p>
<p>Consider that MTE can be <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/108035/0100/How-does-MTE-work-/When-to-use-SYNC-and-ASYNC-MTE-modes">configured</a> to report memory corruption either synchronously or asynchronously. In the latter mode, memory corruption doesn’t immediately raise an exception, leaving a race window open for attackers. We would not implement such a mechanism. We believe memory safety protections need to be strictly synchronous, on by default, and working continuously. But supporting always-on, synchronous MTE across key attack surfaces while preserving a great, high-performance user experience is extremely demanding for hardware to support.</p>
<p>In addition, for MTE to provide memory safety in an adversarial context, we would need to finely tune the operating system to defend the new semantics and the confidentiality of memory tags on which MTE relies. Ultimately, we determined that to deliver truly best-in-class memory safety, we would carry out a massive engineering effort spanning all of Apple — including updates to Apple silicon, our operating systems, and our software frameworks. This effort, together with our highly successful secure memory allocator work, would transform MTE from a helpful debugging tool into a groundbreaking new security feature.</p>
<p>Today we’re introducing the culmination of this effort: Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE), our comprehensive memory safety defense for Apple platforms. Memory Integrity Enforcement is built on the robust foundation provided by our <strong>secure memory allocators</strong>, coupled with <strong>Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE)</strong> in synchronous mode, and supported by extensive <strong>Tag Confidentiality Enforcement</strong> policies. MIE is built right into Apple hardware and software in all models of iPhone 17 and iPhone Air and offers unparalleled, always-on memory safety protection for our key attack surfaces including the kernel, while maintaining the power and performance that users expect. In addition, we’re making EMTE available to all Apple developers in Xcode as part of the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-enhanced-security-for-your-app#Adopt-hardware-memory-tagging">Enhanced Security</a> feature that we released earlier this year during WWDC.</p>
<p>The rest of this post dives into the intensive engineering effort required to design and validate Memory Integrity Enforcement.</p>
<h3>Designing Memory Integrity Enforcement</h3>
<p>Memory Integrity Enforcement starts with our secure memory allocators — kalloc_type, xzone malloc, and WebKit’s libpas — all of which use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adopting-type-aware-memory-allocation">type information</a> to decide how to organize memory allocations. With both use-after-free and out-of-bounds bugs, an attacker’s goal is to create overlapping interpretations of memory, which they achieve by controlling the precise position of certain allocations — of a specific type — that is advantageous to them. The type-aware placement policies of our secure memory allocators help thwart these memory corruption techniques, as we described in our <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/what-if-we-had-sockpuppet-in-ios16/">kalloc_type post</a>. Our secure allocators set a new high-water mark of software protection against memory corruption, while preserving the same or better performance as the allocators they replaced.</p>
<p>Allocators can apply protections only at the granularity of memory pages — 16KB on iOS — which is a natural fit for multi-page allocations. For smaller allocations, our secure allocators can use page-level protections to help prevent memory corruption attacks across different type buckets. However, page-level protections are too coarse to defend against attacks within the same type bucket, and we use memory tagging to close this gap.</p>
<p>Let’s look at how EMTE can be used to protect against two of the most common types of memory corruption: buffer overflows and use-after-free vulnerabilities. For buffer overflows, the allocator is responsible for using different tags for neighboring allocations. If a request to access memory spills over to adjacent memory that has a different tag, the hardware blocks it, and the operating system can take action and terminate the process. We represent this visually below with three adjacent allocations, tagged with three different secrets: ⏺️, 🔼, and ⏹️. Two access attempts with the 🔼 tag are permitted to 🔼-tagged memory, but the third attempt is blocked as it spills over into the adjacent, ⏹️-tagged allocation.</p>
<p> Memory Integrity Enforcement blocks buffer overflows </p>

<p>The allocator is also responsible for retagging memory as it gets reused for other purposes. In the image below, the 🔼 allocation is retagged as ⏹️ after it has been freed and reallocated by the system. If a request to the retagged memory is made with the older 🔼 tag, as would be seen in use-after-free exploits, the hardware blocks it and lets the operating system take further action.</p>
<p> Memory Integrity Enforcement blocks use-after-free access</p>

<p>A key weakness of the original MTE specification is that access to non-tagged memory, such as global variables, is not checked by the hardware. This means attackers don’t have to face as many defensive constraints when attempting to control core application configuration and state. With Enhanced MTE, we instead specify that accessing non-tagged memory from a tagged memory region requires knowing that region’s tag, making it significantly harder for attackers to turn out-of-bounds bugs in dynamic tagged memory into a way to sidestep EMTE by directly modifying non-tagged allocations.</p>
<p>Finally, we developed <strong>Tag Confidentiality Enforcement</strong> to protect the implementation of our secure allocators from technical threats and to guard the confidentiality of EMTE tags — including against side-channel and speculative-execution attacks.</p>
<p>Our typed allocators and EMTE both rely on confidentiality of kernel data structures from user applications, and of the tags chosen by the allocator. Attackers might attempt to defeat EMTE, and in turn Memory Integrity Enforcement, by revealing these secrets. To protect the kernel allocator backing store and tag storage, we use the <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/operating-system-integrity-sec8b776536b/1/web/1#secd022396fb">Secure Page Table Monitor</a>, which provides strong guarantees even in the presence of a kernel compromise. We also ensure that when the kernel accesses memory on behalf of an application, it's subject to the same tag-checking rules as userspace.</p>
<p>Attacks based on speculative execution can also be used to expose secrets. To improve performance, modern CPUs predict the execution of instructions that follow prior, potentially longer latency instructions. If the prediction is correct, computation is very fast. If it’s wrong, the CPU discards the prediction, and computation is slower. Unfortunately, discarded predictions have observable effects that can reveal system state and data, and because speculative attacks never cause the system to crash or misbehave in observable ways during their use, they’re particularly useful for an attacker. For example, evaluating a pointer authentication instruction speculatively exposed <a href="https://pacmanattack.com/">timing differences</a> in our original implementation of Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC), which would allow the valid signature to be isolated. During the design phase for Memory Integrity Enforcement, we identified and addressed the three speculative vulnerabilities that could undermine tag confidentiality.</p>
<p>First, when EMTE is active, requests to access memory cause the hardware to check tags. It's crucial that evaluating a tag-checking instruction speculatively doesn’t expose timing differences that would allow an attacker to isolate the valid tag. From the start, we designed the Apple silicon implementation so that tag values can’t influence speculative execution in any way. Recently published <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08719">security research</a> demonstrates that the MTE implementation on Google’s Pixel devices is vulnerable to this type of attack, allowing MTE to be bypassed in Google Chrome and the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>Second, allocators assign random tags to memory, and attackers must not be able to predict tag values that the system will choose. We address this issue by frequently re-seeding the underlying pseudo-random generator used to select new tags.</p>
<p>Third, <a href="https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf">Spectre variant 1 (V1)</a> is a speculative-execution vulnerability that allows attackers to exploit conditional branches to leak data, including MTE tag values. To date, there has been no solution to this problem in consumer operating systems, because general Spectre V1 mitigations such as <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.html">Speculative Load Hardening</a> have a prohibitive CPU cost. The presence of EMTE leaves Spectre V1 as one of the last avenues available to attackers to help guide their attacks, so we designed a completely novel mitigation that limits the effective reach of Spectre V1 leaks — at virtually zero CPU cost — and forces attackers to contend with type segregation. This mitigation makes it impractical for attackers to use Spectre V1, as they would typically need 25 or more V1 sequences to reach more than 95 percent exploitability rate — unless one of these sequences is related to the bug being exploited, following similar reasoning as our <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/towards-the-next-generation-of-xnu-memory-safety#benefits">kalloc_type analysis</a>.</p>
<p>Our mission with Memory Integrity Enforcement is to protect all users by default and provide an extraordinary disruption to the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities. To do so, we considered a wide set of threats, including some of the most challenging ones — such as side channels — and arrived at this extensive combination of features not present in other MTE implementations. Google took a great first step last year when they offered MTE to those who opt in to their program for at-risk users. But even for users who turn it on, the effectiveness of MTE on Android is limited by the lack of deep integration with the operating system that distinguishes Memory Integrity Enforcement and its use of EMTE on Apple silicon.</p>
<p>For the new A19 and A19 Pro chips to support Memory Integrity Enforcement, we dedicated an extraordinary amount of Apple silicon resources to security — more than ever before — including CPU area, CPU speed, and memory for tag storage. And to fully realize this hardware investment, we designed all of the new operating system elements of MIE jointly with our hardware work, including secure allocators, EMTE, and tag confidentiality protections.</p>
<p>Because EMTE tag checking imposes a performance cost, we designed Memory Integrity Enforcement to take advantage of our secure allocators first and use EMTE to protect only smaller individual allocations within a type bucket, which software allocators can’t defend on their own. Then, by knowing where and how we would deploy EMTE, we could accurately model the tag-checking demand of the operating system, and design our silicon to satisfy it. Our hardware implementation influenced additional software design decisions, reducing the overhead of tag checks even further. Importantly, deploying EMTE with this level of precision supports our strategy to provide as many memory safety improvements as possible to users on previous iPhone generations, which don’t support EMTE.</p>
<p>For the security evaluation of Memory Integrity Enforcement, we involved our offensive research team from the very beginning. From 2020 to 2025, they continuously analyzed and attacked the system — first conceptually, with theoretical exploitation avenues, then with practical attacks in simulated environments, and eventually on new hardware prototypes. Prolonged engagement from our offensive research team allowed us to identify and eradicate entire attack strategies and techniques before attackers could ever discover them, leading to a stronger, more mature feature from the outset.</p>
<p>Our offensive research team identified where and how attackers are most likely to break into the system, and our deployment of Memory Integrity Enforcement is deeply guided by their findings. Notably, this includes making sure that this powerful new protection is available to third-party apps that are likely entry points for attackers — such as social networks, messaging apps, or any other app where a specific user can be targeted. Starting immediately with the launch of MIE, any developer can begin testing this powerful protection for their app, including EMTE on hardware that supports it, using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-enhanced-security-for-your-app#Adopt-hardware-memory-tagging">Enhanced Security</a> settings in Xcode.</p>
<p>The meticulous planning and implementation of Memory Integrity Enforcement made it possible to maintain synchronous tag checking for all the demanding workloads of our platforms, delivering groundbreaking security with minimal performance impact, while remaining completely invisible to users.</p>
<h3>Security evaluation</h3>
<p>Memory Integrity Enforcement started with a deeply ambitious goal: to make it immensely more expensive and difficult to develop and maintain mercenary spyware attacks based on memory corruption against our platforms. While there’s no such thing as perfect security, MIE is designed to dramatically constrain attackers and their degrees of freedom during exploitation.</p>
<p>Throughout the design and implementation of Memory Integrity Enforcement, our offensive research team evaluated our progress by looking at sophisticated exploit chains that were previously used against our platform, recent vulnerabilities, and our own internal research. First, we worked on rebuilding and adapting previously seen exploit chains to systems protected by MIE. But it’s not sufficient to consider only previous chains that were developed before MIE existed, because attackers will surely adapt in reaction to these new protections. We therefore also evaluated a selection of more recent vulnerabilities that we expected would have the best chance of surviving MIE. For these, we meticulously enumerated all possible exploitation opportunities, similar to our evaluation of <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/what-if-we-had-sockpuppet-in-ios16/">SockPuppet against kalloc_type</a>.</p>
<p>Both approaches revealed the same conclusion: Memory Integrity Enforcement vastly reduces the exploitation strategies available to attackers. Though memory corruption bugs are usually interchangeable, MIE cut off so many exploit steps at a fundamental level that it was not possible to restore the chains by swapping in new bugs. Even with substantial effort, we could not rebuild any of these chains to work around MIE. The few memory corruption effects that remained are unreliable and don’t give attackers sufficient momentum to successfully exploit these bugs.</p>
<p>Here’s a visual representation of what this looks like for an attacker. The chart below represents six of the real-world exploit chains that we evaluated and shows the steps where Memory Integrity Enforcement — the secure allocators, EMTE, or both — stops the attack.</p>
<p> Memory Integrity Enforcement vs. real-world exploit chains</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/xlarge_advanced-memory-integrity-light.png 2500w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/large_advanced-memory-integrity-light.png 1650w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/medium_advanced-memory-integrity-light.png 1300w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/small_advanced-memory-integrity-light.png 840w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/xsmall_advanced-memory-integrity-light.png 560w" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" decoding="async" loading="lazy"><img alt="Memory Integrity Enforcement vs. real-world exploit chains" src="https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/medium_advanced-memory-integrity-dark.png" srcset="https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/xlarge_advanced-memory-integrity-dark.png 2500w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/large_advanced-memory-integrity-dark.png 1650w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/medium_advanced-memory-integrity-dark.png 1300w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/small_advanced-memory-integrity-dark.png 840w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/xsmall_advanced-memory-integrity-dark.png 560w" sizes="(max-width:734px) 100vw, (max-width:1068px) calc(100vw - 76px), 650px" decoding="async" loading="lazy"></picture></figure>
<p>Notably, attackers confront Memory Integrity Enforcement early in the exploitation process. Although some issues are able to survive MIE — for example, intra-allocation buffer overflows — such issues are extremely rare, and even fewer will lend themselves to a full end-to-end exploit. Inevitably, attackers must face MIE at a stage where their capabilities are still very limited, leaving few viable avenues for exploitation. This leads to fragile chains where breaking just one step is often enough to invalidate the entire exploit strategy. When that happens, most of the chain’s components can’t be reused, and the attackers have to restart exploit development with entirely new bugs.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The industry-leading security of iPhone means that the vast majority of our users never face system-level attacks on their devices. Our work on memory safety is aimed primarily at the mercenary spyware and surveillance industry, which spends many millions of dollars to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities and target a small number of individuals because of who they are and what they do. Over the past five years, we developed a comprehensive approach to memory safety that integrates the best of our hardware and software capabilities, and today’s announcement is the culmination of this ambitious vision. With the introduction of the iPhone 17 lineup and iPhone Air, we’re excited to deliver Memory Integrity Enforcement: the industry’s first ever, comprehensive, always-on memory-safety protection covering key attack surfaces — including the kernel and over 70 userland processes — built on the Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE) and supported by secure typed allocators and tag confidentiality protections.</p>
<p>Based on our evaluations pitting Memory Integrity Enforcement against exceptionally sophisticated mercenary spyware attacks from the last three years, we believe MIE will make exploit chains significantly more expensive and difficult to develop and maintain, disrupt many of the most effective exploitation techniques from the last 25 years, and completely redefine the landscape of memory safety for Apple products. Because of how dramatically it reduces an attacker’s ability to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities on our devices, we believe Memory Integrity Enforcement represents the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

                 <div><strong><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span></strong>&nbsp;Apple today debuted the all-new <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-air/" target="_blank">iPhone Air</a>, the thinnest iPhone ever made, with pro performance. iPhone Air features a breakthrough titanium design that is elegant and light yet strong, with an innovative internal architecture that enables the latest iPhone experiences.

</div>

                 <div>Featuring a breakthrough design with pro performance, iPhone Air is the thinnest iPhone ever made at 5.6mm, and it is incredibly light, with a large, stunning display. The grade 5 titanium frame is strong, with an elegant high-gloss mirror finish, and a new plateau on the back that is precision-milled on both sides to house the cameras, speaker, and Apple silicon. This maximizes space for the battery to deliver remarkable all-day battery life. The thin design also features the Action button, so users can easily access a variety of functions with just a press, and Camera Control, to quickly launch the camera or enable visual intelligence.<sup>2</sup>

                 <div>The stunning 6.5-inch Super Retina XDR display features ProMotion, with an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz for smooth scrolling and stunning graphics. The Always-On display shows important information at a glance, and when not in use, it efficiently adjusts down to 1Hz. iPhone Air is easy to use outside with 3000 nits peak outdoor brightness — the highest ever on iPhone — and 2x better outdoor contrast.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>iPhone Air also introduces the Ceramic Shield 2 front cover, which is tougher than any smartphone glass or glass-ceramic with a new Apple-designed coating, providing 3x better scratch resistance and improved anti-reflection to reduce glare. For the very first time, Ceramic Shield now protects the back of iPhone, including the plateau, delivering 4x better resistance to cracks than the back glass on previous models. And with the strong titanium frame, iPhone Air exceeds Apple’s stringent bend strength requirements. This design makes iPhone Air more durable than any previous iPhone.

                 <div>iPhone Air introduces an all-new Center Stage front camera that advances the photo and video experience. The Center Stage front camera features the first square front camera sensor on iPhone, offering a wide field of view and capturing photos up to 18MP. Users no longer have to rotate their iPhone to take a landscape selfie — they can take photos and videos in portrait or landscape while holding their iPhone vertically. For group shots, Center Stage for photos uses AI to automatically expand the field of view and can rotate from portrait to landscape to include everyone in the frame. The Center Stage front camera enables ultra-stabilized video in 4K HDR, and users can record on the front and rear cameras simultaneously with Dual Capture — perfect for documenting themselves and the world around them. During calls over FaceTime or third-party apps, Center Stage for video calls keeps users stable and positioned in frame.

                <div>Dual Capture is a new feature that combines the front and rear cameras, so users can record themselves while at a concert or get their reaction to a game’s big play.</div>

                 <div>A versatile new 48MP Fusion camera system gives users the equivalent of four lenses in their pocket. The custom main lens enables the popular 28mm and 35mm focal lengths, so users have more options to frame their shot, and the large 2.0µm quad-pixel sensor with sensor-shift OlS excels in low light. Users can also get closer to their subject with the optical-quality 2x Telephoto, which features an updated Photonic Engine that captures more lifelike details and color.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>A new image pipeline built for iPhone Air enables next-generation portraits with Focus Control at the same level as multicamera systems, automatically capturing depth information so users can turn photos into portraits later in the Photos app. iPhone Air also supports the latest generation of Photographic Styles, including a new Bright style that brightens skin tones and applies a pop of vibrance across the image.<sup>3</sup>

                 <div>Apple 2030 is the company’s ambitious plan to be carbon neutral across its entire footprint by the end of this decade by reducing product emissions from their three biggest sources: materials, electricity, and transportation. iPhone Air is made with 35 percent recycled content, including 80 percent recycled titanium, the highest ever for an iPhone, and 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery. A new titanium USB-C port is 3D-printed to be thinner and stronger, fitting into the slim design while using 33 percent less material than a conventional forging process. iPhone Air is manufactured with 45 percent renewable electricity, like wind and solar, across the supply chain. It is designed to be durable, repairable, and offer industry-leading software support, while meeting Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and safe chemistry. The paper packaging is 100 percent fiber-based and can be easily recycled.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="E-Paper Display Reaches the Realm of LCD Screens"><p><a data-linked-post="2656435247" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-e-ink-developed-full-color-epaper" target="_blank">E-paper displays</a> are prized for their readability and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/low-power">low power</a> use, but they’ve long been dismissed as too slow for everyday computing. </p><p>Modos, a two-person startup with open-hardware roots, thinks it has cracked part of that problem with a development kit capable of driving an <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/e-paper">e-paper</a> display at refresh rates up to a record 75 hertz.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/modos-tech/modos-paper-monitor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Modos Paper Monitor and Dev Kit</a>, now available for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/crowdfunding">crowdfunding</a> on Crowd Supply, combines standard e-paper panels with an <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/open-source">open source</a> <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/fpga" target="_self">FPGA</a>-based display controller. While the kit provides enthusiasts and developers a complete package (with e-paper display, display driver, and hardware adapter), it’s also an entry point for experimenting with different e-paper displays.</p><p>RELATED: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-e-ink-developed-full-color-epaper" target="_blank">How E Ink Developed Full-Color E-paper</a></p><p><span>“I would say instead of our secret sauce, </span><span>we have</span> open sauce<span>,” </span><span>says</span> cofounder <a href="https://alexsoto.dev/" target="_blank">Alexander Soto</a>. “<span>You</span> don’t even need to use the panel <span>we’re</span> offering. You could use a different panel and still get <span>[75 Hz]</span><span>.”</span></p><h2>E-paper at 75 Hz</h2><p>Most e-paper panels update at a refresh rate of around 10 Hz or less. (E-paper is the generic term for screens that mimic the appearance of ink on paper—the most well-known brand being that made by the company E Ink.) Some displays don’t even quote a refresh rate and may require up to a full second to refresh. </p><p>A better refresh rate means a display can show more frames each second, which in turn provides smoother, more lifelike motion. Modern <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/digital-video">digital video</a> is usually delivered at 30 or 60 frames per second, which until recently was well beyond the reach of an e-paper display. This is an area where e-paper clearly lags <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/lcd">LCD</a> displays, which start at 60 Hz <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computer-display-500-hertz" target="_self">and go up from there</a>.</p><p>Modos is able to hit refresh rates of up to 75 Hz on a 13-inch e-paper panel with a 1,600 by 1,200 resolution. (a 6-inch e-paper panel with 1,448 by 1,072 resolution and the same refresh rate is available, too.) <span>Bumping the refresh rate also reduces latency. That’s a key point, as it allows an e-paper display to be used in situations where latency matters, such as a computer or tablet display.</span></p><p>“A lot of people default to thinking that with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/e-readers">e-readers</a> or e-paper, it’s slow, it’s going to be flashing all the time,” says Soto. “Our challenge has been going to conferences, going to events, and showing people…e-paper can be very fast.” </p><h2>Open Source E-Paper Display Controller</h2><p>Modos’s quoted 75-Hz refresh rate is the highest yet for an e-paper display, but it’s arguably not the key innovation. Several competitors already <a href="https://shop.dasung.com/products/dasung-paperlike-103-the-worlds-first-60hz-e-ink-monitor?srsltid=AfmBOorlsMmiegZ0giXwX251IS66vU2ndubmx7sO-in0dfuYmove1fdS" target="_blank">offer e-paper displays with refresh rates up to 60 Hz which</a>, though lower, is close. </p><p>But Modos has a not-so-secret weapon: Caster, an open-source e-paper display controller that’s compatible with a wide variety of e-paper panels. The display controller, which is based on the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/amd">AMD</a> Spartan-6 <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/fpga">FPGA</a>, departs from typical e-paper controllers with pixel-level display management. </p><p>“Traditionally, the [e-paper display] controller used a single-state machine to control the entire panel, with only two states: static and updating,” says Modos cofounder <a href="https://github.com/zephray" target="_blank">Wenting Zhang</a>. “Caster treats each pixel individually rather than as a whole panel, which allows localized control on the pixels.”</p><p>The FPGA display controller is paired with Modos’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/glider">Glider</a> Mega Adapter, which includes four different display connectors compatible with several dozen e-paper displays ranging in size from 4.3 to 13 inches. Soto says the adapter can be used to repurpose displays salvaged from older e-readers, like Amazon’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/kindle">Kindle</a>.</p><p> <span data-rm-shortcode-id="82b00cdb83e4c7253acea47ddb69f8b5"><iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" type="lazy-iframe" scrolling="no" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N_Lqa1FMtpw?rel=0" width="100%"></iframe></span> <small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">A 75-Hz refresh rate allows for smoother scrolling.</small> <small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Modos</small> </p><p>Modos also provides an application <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/programming">programming</a> interface (API), written in the C programming language, that lets applications select display-driving modes dynamically. As the video above shows, a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/linux">Linux</a> window manager can be used to render text in a low-latency binary color mode, display maps in more detailed yet responsive gray scale, and display video with maximum-fidelity gray scale—all simultaneously on the same screen. </p><p>The code and schematics for Caster, Glider, and the API are open source <a href="https://github.com/Modos-Labs" target="_blank">and available on Github</a>. </p><h2>Crowdfunding for E-paper Innovation</h2><p>Modos’s crowdfunding campaign is set to conclude on <span>18 September. </span>Orders are expected to ship in January of 2026, although (as is often the case for crowdfunded projects) the shipping window is not guaranteed. </p><p>Getting to this stage has taken several years. The company’s founders initially hoped to build an e-paper laptop, the <a href="https://www.modos.tech/blog/modos-paper-laptop" target="_blank">Modos Paper Laptop</a>, which was announced in January of 2022. However, the realities of electronics manufacturing complicated that project early in its life and the laptop was never made available to order. </p><p>“Part of it was that the primary aspect ratio for the majority of [laptop] chassises are for 16:9 and 16:10. And when you look at e-paper displays, it was an aspect ratio of 4:3. So, we either had to make a custom chassis, or a custom panel, both of them being prohibitively expensive,” says Soto.</p><p>Panel sourcing also remains a hurdle. E-paper’s production is geared toward e-readers and signage, which means most panels aren’t the right size for a computer. However, the Modos Paper Monitor and Dev Kit found a practical compromise in recently introduced 13-inch e-paper displays, many of which provide a resolution similar to LCD and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/oled">OLED</a> panels developed for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/laptops">laptops</a>. </p><p>In this way, the Dev Kit is a continuation of Modos’s original goal. While building a full-fledged e-paper laptop was impractical, the Dev Kit’s high refresh rate, open-source display controller, and API give ambitious users the opportunity to implement their own low-latency e-paper computer display—or anything else they put their mind to.</p><p><em>This article was updated on 8 September 2025 to replace mentions of “E Ink” (the specific e-paper technology developed by the company of the same name) with “e-paper.”</em><br></p></div></div>]]></description>
