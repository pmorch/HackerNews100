<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the people of the Venezuelan state of Mérida, the glaciated peaks of its Sierra Nevada have been a source of pride since time immemorial: The mountains are part of the regional identity and the origin of various&nbsp;<a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;client=webapp&amp;u=http://www.saber.ula.ve/bitstream/handle/123456789/49064/art.2_Cinco_Aguilas_Blancas.pdf?sequence%3D5%26isAllowed%3Dy" target="_blank">legends in the area</a>&nbsp;that relate them to mythical white eagles. </p><p>However, none of the six glaciers that crowned the mountains remain.</p><p>The International Climate and Cryosphere Initiative (ICCI), a science advocacy organization, recently declared that the Humboldt Glacier — also known as La Corona, or "the crown" in Spanish — is already "too small to be classified as a glacier.” In March, Venezuelan scientists had warned that the glacier had dramatically shrunk. </p><p>"Our tropical glaciers began to disappear since the '70s and their absence is felt. It is a great sadness and the only thing we can do is use their legacy to show children how beautiful our Sierra Nevada was,” Alejandra Melfo, an astrophysicist at the Universidad de los Andes in Mérida, said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo.</p><p>Venezuela had six glaciers in the Sierra Nevada, located about 16,000 feet above sea level. By 2011, five had already disappeared, but the Humboldt Glacier located near the second highest mountain in the country, Humboldt Peak, resisted the onslaught of the weather. Scientists believe its disappearance makes Venezuela the first country in the Americas — and the first country in modern history — to lose all its glaciers.</p><p>Glaciers are large masses of ice that have formed due to the accumulation of snow over centuries. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), they typically exist where average annual temperatures reach near-freezing levels and winter precipitation causes significant accumulations of&nbsp;snow.</p><p>An important aspect of glacier development is that temperatures during the rest of the year should not cause the complete loss of the previous winter’s snow accumulation, this is how glaciers are maintained and how they grow. And that’s what failed in the Humboldt case.</p><p>"In the case of the Humboldt, it's a process of erosion that has been going on for years without stopping," Melfo said. </p><p>With the increase in global temperatures due to climate change, the melting of large ice masses is a continuous phenomenon that, among other things, contributes to raising sea levels around the world.</p><p>"It is the end of a glacial cycle. And in the intertropical zones, basically below 5,000 meters, almost all the glaciers have been disappearing," said Maximiliano Bezada, a geological researcher at the University of Minnesota. "The case of Humboldt was iconic because it is at 4,800 meters and yet it remained for quite a long time, and that is a climatic anomaly."</p><p>Although the Humboldt Glacier was expected to last at least another decade, scientists had been unable to monitor the area where it's  located due to the country’s political turmoil.</p><p>“Venezuela’s glaciers are not the first to disappear, some have disappeared in Colombia and other countries. What happens is that Venezuela had few and all in the Sierra Nevada, I saw how the glaciers of Pico La Concha and Pico Bolívar disappeared. That is why it is the first country to run out of glaciers,” Melfo said.</p><h2>'The consequences of higher temperatures'</h2><p>Due to their large mass, glaciers tend to flow like very slow rivers. Although there is no universal consensus on how large an ice mass must be to be considered a glacier, the USGS states that a commonly accepted standard is about 25 acres. </p><p>The case of the Humboldt glacier is not the only one. Glaciers around the world are shrinking, and some are disappearing faster in defiance of scientific projections. A&nbsp;<a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;client=webapp&amp;u=https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo1324" target="_blank">2023 study</a>&nbsp;analyzed the planet’s 215,000 terrestrial glaciers more comprehensively than previous research and concluded that, if temperatures continue to increase, 83% of the world’s glaciers will be gone by the year 2100.</p><p>“Although the end of the glacier was something that was going to happen due to the cycle we are experiencing, there is no doubt that global warming, a product of greenhouse gases, has of course accelerated the disappearance process,” Bezada said.</p><p>Between 1952 and 2019 alone, Venezuela’s glacier surface went from 2,317 square kilometers to just 0.046 square kilometers, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://translate.google.com/website?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;client=webapp&amp;u=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15230430.2020.1822728" target="_blank">a 2020 study</a>.</p><p>“There are several projects that monitor change in the Sierra Nevada with temperature sensors buried in the ground and that are measured every six months. The evidence shows warming, in addition, the plants that grow there are changing because climate change is already felt in the peaks of the Andes,” Melfo said.</p><p>Researchers believe that the El Niño climate phenomenon influenced the melting of the Humboldt Glacier, because it causes warmer temperatures that accelerate the disappearance of tropical glaciers.</p><p>“The speed at which glaciers are melting is evidence of climate change. However, this is not new. Glaciers began to disappear a long time ago, but the speed has changed due to high temperatures," Melfo said. "Beyond the glaciers, we are seeing rapid changes in the composition of species, plants and animals, and this is recorded. Denying climate change has become a very dangerous thing for everyone."</p><p>The Andes region — a mountain range running through parts of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela — has seen a temperature rise of at least 0.10 degrees Celsius over the past seven decades. For several scientists, that is one of the main reasons why Venezuela has lost all its glaciers.</p><p>“In the Andean zone of Venezuela, there have been some months with monthly anomalies above average, which is exceptional in those tropical latitudes,” said Maximiliano Herrera, climatologist and weather historian.</p><p>However, the melting of the glacier is also an opportunity for further study. Melfo said that the end of the glacier in Venezuela marks the beginning of a new process in the area and an event that will have to be investigated.</p><p>"Life starts to rise and colonize the rock. The lichens come first, then the mosses create the soil, organic matter is created and that creates conditions for the plants to arrive, and then the animals come. This is how an ecosystem is assembled; it's called primary succession and it is a unique process," she said. </p><p>Meanwhile, what little ice remains on Humboldt will continue to melt. Residents of Mérida, including Melfo, say the glacier will continue to exist as long as the white vestiges can be seen from the city — which stopped happening with the other glaciers.</p><p>“For the people of Mérida, perhaps the most beloved glacier was that of Pico Bolívar, which since 2012 was a remnant of a glacier. However, people continued to say that it was a glacier until the last bit of ice that could be seen from the city disappeared in 2020," Melfo said. "I think the same thing is going to happen with the Humboldt: until the last piece disappears, we are going to continue saying that it is a glacier."</p><p><a href="https://www.telemundo.com/noticias/noticias-telemundo/medio-ambiente/glaciar-humboldt-venezuela-rcna153532" target="_blank">An earlier version of this story was first published in Noticias Telemundo.</a></p><br></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><p><span data-testid="byline-thumbnail"></span><span data-testid="byline-name">Albinson Linares, Noticias Telemundo</span><span></span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>When doctors removed Miriam Staunton's tumour from her armpit six years ago, they told the 51-year-old Irish woman that she had a 70 per cent chance of relapse. Yet, in the months following the operation, she was only offered local radiation and regular check-ups, but no drug treatment.&nbsp;</span> <br><span></span> <br><span>"I remember when I met the oncologist and he said that he wasn't in a position to offer me anything systemic at that point," Staunton recalls. "I didn't really understand exactly what he meant by it at that time."</span> <br><span></span> <br><span>What Staunton did not realise is that she would have to wait for her melanoma to return one year later before she could be entitled to effective but expensive medicines. After the cancer had progressed to stage four in February 2019, she started a course of Opdivo combined with Yervoy, breakthrough drugs known as immunotherapy, which were then restricted to the most severe forms of cancer in Ireland due to their high costs.&nbsp;</span> <br><span></span> <br><span>In other parts of Europe, Staunton could have taken Opdivo alone shortly after her surgery. In July 2018, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) opened the therapy to stage three melanoma patients. France immediately reimbursed it, but Ireland did not. "It's one thing when there is no cure, but when the treatment exists and people can't access it, that's fundamentally wrong," says Staunton, who is now cancer-free. </span> <br></p><div><p><img srcset="https://www.investigate-europe.eu/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.investigateeurope.com%2Fuploads%2Fedit0DSC00018.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.investigate-europe.eu/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.investigateeurope.com%2Fuploads%2Fedit0DSC00018.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" width="3160" height="3160" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"></p><p><span>Miriam Staunton was unable at first to access the cancer drug she needed because it was not available in Ireland. </span><span>Maxence Peigné</span></p><hr></div><p><span>The reason for this delay is that Ireland and the American drugmaker, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), could not agree on Opdivo's price. When the EMA approves new medicines for use in the EU, each member state has to strike reimbursement deals with producers individually. </span><a target="" href="https://www.investigate-europe.eu/posts/deadly-prices-medicine-dealers-europe-secret-drug-negotiations"><span>Negotiations can be lengthy, as companies often prioritise rich markets and governments seek confidential discounts.</span></a><span></span> <br><span></span> <br><span>Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical industry - like many other sectors - hoards eye-watering gains in tax havens. Investigate Europe can reveal that the 15 largest European and US drugmakers, including BMS, publicly disclose over 1,300 subsidiaries in tax havens and low-tax territories.&nbsp;</span> <br><span></span> <br><span>These jurisdictions offer corporations low taxes or ways to shift profits (sometimes both). In Europe, researchers and activists generally agree that they include Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Luxembourg. They are among the top five profit-shifting destinations globally, according to this year’s </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.taxobservatory.eu//www-site/uploads/2023/10/global_tax_evasion_report_24.pdf"><span>EU Tax Observatory report</span></a><span>, an EU-funded think-tank.&nbsp;</span> <br><span></span> <br><span>The little-known structures in tax-friendly destinations have contributed to the 15 pharmaceutical firms amassing profits of €580 billion in the last five years.&nbsp;</span> <br><span></span> <br><span>This amount outweighs their research and development (R&amp;D) costs, despite the industry's frequent claim that high drug prices allow them to innovate and design new drugs. The returns are in keeping with the outsized profits that are synonymous with the wider sector. Some of the groups' Irish affiliates have racked up hundreds of billions of dollars and still rely on a version of the 'Double Irish' tax avoidance scheme, the analysis finds.</span> <br><span></span> <br><span>"Corporate tax avoidance is not victimless, fewer taxes mean less investment in healthcare in Ireland and also negative impacts for countries in the Global South," says Aideen Elliott of Oxfam Ireland. "Nothing these companies are doing is illegal. They are taking advantage of corporate tax rules."</span> <br></p><div><p><img srcset="https://www.investigate-europe.eu/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.investigateeurope.com%2Fuploads%2FNEW-shutterstock_2401059949.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.investigate-europe.eu/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.investigateeurope.com%2Fuploads%2FNEW-shutterstock_2401059949.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" width="3160" height="3160" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"></p><p><span>The $580 billion made by the 15 firms in the past five years outweighs what they collectively spent on research and development.</span><span>Shutterstock</span></p><hr></div><p><span>All corporations cited in this article were contacted for comments.

Opdivo was finally reimbursed in February 2021, two and a half years after France. The final discount remains a trade secret.</span> <br></p><div><h4>“<!-- -->Corporate tax avoidance is not victimless, fewer taxes mean less investment in healthcare in Ireland and also negative impacts for countries in the Global South.<!-- -->”</h4><p>— <!-- -->Aideen Elliott, Oxfam Ireland</p></div><p><span>Ironically, BMS makes Opdivo in Dublin, at a facility close to Staunton's home. While the treatment wasn't accessible to some Irish patients due to its cost, the supplier was raking in sky-high profits thanks to Ireland's attractive tax rules.</span> <br><span></span> <br><span>BMS's sprawling state-of-the-art campus in the Irish capital belongs to a subsidiary that boasted a $17.2 billion turnover in 2022, more than a third of the manufacturer's global revenues that year. Yet despite being registered in Ireland, Swords Laboratories is a Swiss entity for tax purposes.</span> <br><span></span> <br><span>Its direct parent, Bristol-Myers Squibb Holdings Ireland, enjoys a similar double residency and owns patents for several BMS therapies. In 2022, the holding valued the assets at more than $1 billion and pocketed $4.5 billion in royalties linked to drugs produced by Swords Laboratories, such as Eliquis, a bestselling blood thinner. In addition, the holding received almost $9 billion in dividends from the Dublin plant in just two years. </span> <br></p><div><p><img srcset="https://www.investigate-europe.eu/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.investigateeurope.com%2Fuploads%2Feditshutterstock_2394208173.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.investigate-europe.eu/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.investigateeurope.com%2Fuploads%2Feditshutterstock_2394208173.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" width="3160" height="3160" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"></p><p><span>BMS has operations across the world. The firm turns over billions in revenue each year.</span><span>Shutterstock</span></p><hr></div><p><span>The arrangement resembles an infamous tax avoidance loophole that Ireland vowed to close. Dubbed "the Double Irish", it has been a common tool for tech and pharma groups to slash their effective tax bill below Ireland’s current 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate. The technique involved setting up two Irish companies: one for operational purposes and the other to hold intellectual property (IP). The first would pay royalties to the second, which would be a tax resident offshore, like in Bermuda.</span> <br><span></span> <br><span>"Ireland made changes to its corporate tax residence rules in Finance Act 2014 that are specifically designed to prevent such structures as the so-called 'Double Irish'," a Department of Finance spokesperson said. “These rules ensure that it is not possible for companies to exploit mismatches in tax residency rules.”</span> <br><span></span> <br><span>However, Dr James Stewart, adjunct professor in finance at Trinity College Dublin, says the structures can continue to exist because Ireland has a double taxation treaty with Switzerland.  "These firms have very large assets and flows of funds, generally have no employees and are very profitable. They are likely to be a source of profit extraction," he adds.</span> <br></p><div><h4>“<!-- -->Ireland made changes to its corporate tax residence rules in Finance Act 2014 that are specifically designed to prevent such structures as the so-called 'Double Irish'.<!-- -->”</h4><p>— <!-- -->Irish Department of Finance spokesperson</p></div><p><span>BMS Holdings Ireland's main direct shareholder is also an Irish outfit with Swiss tax residency. The two holdings and Swords Laboratories don't only funnel gains outside of Ireland, they also park them in their coffers. By the end of 2022, the trio had accumulated over $30 billion of equity.</span> <br><span></span> <br><span>Harbouring IP in tax havens is a common practice at BMS. Its patents on Opdivo and Yervoy sit in Delaware, an American state that levies no tax on royalties. The two drugs amounted to a quarter of the group's $45 billion revenue in 2023. That year, BMS listed 135 subsidiaries in tax havens: 81 in Delaware, 15 in Switzerland, 13 in Ireland and 12 in the Netherlands.&nbsp;</span> <br><span></span> <br><span>The structures helped the company reach an effective corporate tax rate of 4.7 per cent, far below the US statutory rate of 21 per cent. Part of it was due to a favourable tax ruling, but the largest reduction resulted from different fiscal treatments in Ireland, Switzerland and Puerto Rico, according to BMS's annual report.</span> <br><span></span> <br><span>The company did not reply to requests for comments.</span> <br></p><div><p><img srcset="https://www.investigate-europe.eu/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.investigateeurope.com%2Fuploads%2Fedit0shutterstock_467065226.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.investigate-europe.eu/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.investigateeurope.com%2Fuploads%2Fedit0shutterstock_467065226.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" width="3160" height="3160" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"></p><p><span>15 of the world’s biggest drugmakers operate more than 1,300 subsidiaries in tax-friendly jurisdictions, such as the US state of Delaware.</span><span>Shutterstock</span></p><hr></div><p><span>BMS is hardly a unique case. Investigate Europe analysed the last five years of accounts filed by the 15 largest American and European pharmaceutical groups. Together, they declared 1,300 subsidiaries in tax havens, as of 2023. The true number is likely higher, as reporting rules only force multinationals to list those undertakings they consider "significant".&nbsp;</span> <br><span></span> <br><span>Delaware took the top spot with 700 entities. The Netherlands came second with almost 170. Switzerland and Ireland were next, with nearly 120 each. Like BMS, US giant Merck established a network of Irish subsidiaries with Swiss tax residency which held at least $44 billion of equity as of 2022.&nbsp;</span> <br><span></span> <br><span>Not all drugmakers rely on a Double Irish scheme. According to Investigate Europe estimates, many of their affiliates had amassed considerable equity in Ireland by 2022's close: $308 billion for Abbvie, over $102 billion for Johnson &amp; Johnson, $20 billion for AstraZeneca and $17 billion for Gilead. </span> <br></p><p><span></span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ipha.ie/about-us/contribution-to-the-irish-economy/"><span>Nine of the 10 biggest</span></a><span> pharma groups in the world have operations in Ireland and the largest is "likely to be Pfizer," suspects Prof Stewart.

In the Netherlands, Pfizer booked three-quarters of its $100 billion global revenues with a Dutch holding at the helm of a myriad of subsidiaries. CPPI CV, a limited partnership, is "fiscally transparent", meaning its shareholders can draw profits untaxed.

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court">The Supreme Court</a></span> on Monday ruled for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution, extending the delay in the Washington criminal case against Donald Trump on charges he <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-indicted-jan-6-investigation-special-counsel-debb59bb7a4d9f93f7e2dace01feccdc">plotted to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss</a></span> and all but ending prospects the former president could be tried before the November election.</p><p>In <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24785411-trump-v-united-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a historic 6-3 ruling</a></span>, the court’s conservative majority, including the three justices appointed by Trump, narrowed the case against him and returned it to the trial court to determine what is left of special counsel Jack Smith’s indictment.</p><p>The court’s decision in a second major Trump case this term, along with its ruling <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-trump-insurrection-election-colorado-51e79c0f03013034c8a042cb278b6446">rejecting efforts to bar him from the ballot</a></span> because of his actions following the 2020 election, underscores the role the justices are playing in the November election. The court last week also limited an obstruction charge faced by Trump and used against hundreds of his supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>




    

<p>“Under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of presidential power entitles a former president to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court. “And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts.”</p>
    
<p>Roberts insisted that the president “is not above the law.” But in a fiery dissent for the court’s three liberals, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, “In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law.”</p><p>Reading from her opinion in the courtroom, Sotomayor said, “Because our Constitution does not shield a former president from answering for criminal and treasonous acts, I dissent.” Sotomayor said the decision “makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of government, that no man is above the law.”</p>
    

<p>The protection afforded presidents by the court, she said, “is just as bad as it sounds, and it is baseless.”</p><p>Trump posted in all capital letters on his social media network shortly after the decision was released: “BIG WIN FOR OUR CONSTITUTION AND DEMOCRACY. PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!”</p><p>Smith’s office declined to comment on the ruling.</p>
    
<p>President Joe Biden’s campaign said in a <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://x.com/BidenHQ/status/1807792569499230699" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a></span> that the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling “doesn’t change the facts” about the events of Jan. 6.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer denounced the ruling as “a disgraceful decision,” made with the help of the three justices that Trump appointed.</p><p>“It undermines SCOTUS’s credibility and suggests political influence trumps all in our courts today,” the New York Democrat said on X.</p><p>The justices knocked out one aspect of the indictment. The opinion found Trump is “absolutely immune” from prosecution for alleged conduct involving discussions with the Justice Department.</p><p>Trump is also “at least presumptively immune” from allegations that he tried to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to reject certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s electoral vote win on Jan. 6, 2021. Prosecutors can try to make the case that Trump’s pressure on Pence still can be part of the case against him, Roberts wrote.</p>
    

<p>The court directed a fact-finding analysis on one of the more striking allegations in the indictment -- that Trump participated in a scheme to enlist fake electors in battleground states won by Biden who would falsely assert that Trump had won. Both sides had dramatically different interpretations as to whether that effort could be construed as official, and the conservative justices said determining which side is correct would require additional analysis at the trial court level.</p><p>Roberts’ opinion further restricted prosecutors by prohibiting them from using any official acts as evidence in trying to prove a president’s unofficial actions violated the law. One example not relevant to this case but which came up in arguments was the hypothetical payment of a bribe in return for an ambassadorial appointment.</p>
    

<p>Under Monday’s decision, a former president could be prosecuted for accepting a bribe, but prosecutors could not mention the official act, the appointment, in their case.</p><p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who joined the rest of Roberts’ opinion, parted company on this point. “The Constitution does not require blinding juries to the circumstances surrounding conduct for which Presidents can be held liable,” Barrett wrote. </p><p>The work of figuring out how to proceed will fall to U.S. District Judge <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-indictment-judge-tanya-chutkan-capitol-riot-9ba5c18d315697d759521425ea203012">Tanya Chutkan</a></span>, who would preside over Trump’s trial.</p><p>Trump still could face a trial, said Notre Dame law professor Derek Muller. “But the fact remains that it is almost impossible to happen before the election.”</p><p>David Becker, an election law expert and the executive director of the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation and Research, called the breadth of immunity granted to Trump “incredibly broad” and “deeply disturbing.”</p>
    

<p>“Almost anything that a president does with the executive branch is characterized as an official act,” he said on a call with reporters following the ruling. He said that “for any unscrupulous individual holding the seat of the Oval Office who might lose an election, the way I read this opinion is it could be a roadmap for them seeking to stay in power.”</p><p>The ruling was the last of the term, and it came more than two months after the court heard arguments, far slower than in other epic high court cases involving the presidency, including <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/john-dean-richard-nixon-government-and-politics-crime-c7a7b99cca7c685cfc239f5e08b53378">the Watergate tapes case</a></span>. </p><p>The Republican former president has denied doing anything wrong and has said this prosecution and three others are politically motivated to try to keep him from returning to the White House. </p><p>In May, Trump became the first former president to be <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-deliberations-jury-testimony-verdict-85558c6d08efb434d05b694364470aa0">convicted of a felony</a></span>, in a New York court. He was found guilty of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment made during the 2016 presidential election to a porn actor who says she had sex with him, which he denies. He still faces <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-hush-money-classified-documents-january-6-a0cb26da1959e2be04a4be2080eba0ad">three other indictments</a></span>.</p><p><span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/jack-smith-special-counsel-prosecutor-donald-trump-garland-e1fdb71cfc258bc2be48a8b890a9269b">Smith</a></span> is leading the two federal probes of the former president, both of which have led to criminal charges. The Washington case focuses on Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election after he lost to Biden. The case in Florida revolves around the mishandling of classified documents. A separate case, in Georgia, also turns on Trump’s actions after his defeat in 2020.</p><p>If Trump’s Washington trial does not take place before the 2024 election and he is not given another four years in the White House, he presumably would stand trial soon thereafter. </p><p>But if he wins, he could appoint an attorney general who would seek the dismissal of this case and the other federal prosecution he faces. He could also attempt to pardon himself if he reclaims the White House. He could not pardon himself for the conviction in state court in New York.</p><p>Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate opinion saying that he believed Smith’s appointment as special counsel was illegitimate. No other justice signed onto that opinion, but the question took center stage in recent arguments in the Florida case over classified documents.</p><p>The Supreme Court that heard the case included three justices appointed by Trump — Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Barrett — and two justices who opted not to step aside after questions were raised about their impartiality.</p><p>Thomas’ wife, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-united-states-government-fraud-mark-meadows-c734294e2810f1240ea7ed1cbf675760">Ginni</a></span>, attended the rally near the White House where Trump spoke on Jan. 6, 2021, though she did not go the Capitol when <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/congress-confirm-joe-biden-78104aea082995bbd7412a6e6cd13818">a mob of Trump supporters</a></span> attacked it soon after. Following the 2020 election, she called the outcome a “heist” and exchanged messages with then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to stand firm with Trump as he falsely claimed that there was widespread election fraud.</p><p>Justice Samuel Alito said there was <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/alito-flag-supreme-court-roberts-justice-senate-e53c1d1fef7b81f9dc87fa31b1622c4c">no reason for him to step aside</a></span> from the cases following reports by The New York Times that said flags similar to those carried by the Jan. 6 rioters flew above his homes in Virginia and on the New Jersey shore. His wife, Martha-Ann Alito, was responsible for flying both the inverted American flag in January 2021 and the “Appeal to Heaven” banner in the summer of 2023, he said in letters to Democratic lawmakers responding to their recusal demands.</p><p>Trump’s trial had been scheduled to begin March 4, but that was before he sought court-sanctioned delays and a full review of the issue by the nation’s highest court. </p><p>Before the Supreme Court got involved, a trial judge and a three-judge appellate panel had ruled unanimously that Trump could be prosecuted for actions undertaken while in the White House and in the run-up to Jan. 6.</p><p>“For the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant,” the appeals court wrote in February. “But any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as President no longer protects him against this prosecution.”</p><p>Chutkan <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-capitol-riot-immunity-donald-trump-a98872759762c95fa925ff831df27388">ruled against Trump’s immunity claim</a></span> in December. In her ruling, Chutkan said the office of the president “does not confer a lifelong ‘get-out-of-jail-free’ pass.”</p><h2>___</h2><p>Associated Press writers Lindsay Whitehurst, Alanna Durkin Richer, Eric Tucker, Stephen Groves, Farnoush Amiri, Michelle Price and Ali Swenson contributed to this report.</p>

Healthcare in the United States runs on private and public insurance billing, but providers spend huge amounts of time on faxes, phone calls, and error-prone legacy systems to get paid. That’s not why they got into care.</p><p>What’s worse, these systems aren’t hugely successful—clinics regularly get back 80% what they know the insurance company should pay.

It starts with ingesting from a clinic’s EHR, then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country. If claims need corrections or appeals, most of the time we can handle those automatically or our CX and Operations team use our in-house internal tools. We also handle patient invoicing for co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles (we never send anything to collections.)</p><p>Our typical paid rate is above 95%.</p><p>We are a team of 25 with strong product market fit—we’ve had to push out onboardings because engineering can’t build quickly enough.</p><p>You’ll be working with an engineering leadership team from AWS and Stripe to get doctors and clinicians back to work helping kids.</p><p>Interested in fixing American healthcare?

SWE interested in all things distributed. I was most recently a Senior SRE at a cybersecurity startup in Dallas, TX. I work at the intersection of Operations, R&amp;D, and SWE so my work involves everything from arm-twisting [major cloud provider] into launching new (previously unavailable) Redis instances overnight to debugging unknown edge cases in production code. Working at a startup I’ve learnt to move fast while NOT breaking things(and quickly fixing things I do end up breaking!), and have worn various hats such as Cloud Security Engineer, SWE, Sr SRE etc as the business evolved. I handled customers directly and owned parts of engineering and infrastructure. Experienced in backend, infrastructure engineering and cloud operations. I'm actively looking for my next adventure(mid to senior engineering roles), if this sounds like a good fit please don't hesitate to reach out!</p></div></td></tr>

I left the software industry several years ago, after 15+ years at a keyboard, and have been happily making a living out in the real world building physical things.

Hi there,</p><p>I'm a systems engineer based out of Vancouver BC, currently completing a master's degree in CS whilst working full time. I have a background in data analytics and engineering (with a bit of DS thrown in) and systems architecture. I'm looking for an engineering role (probably more junior level), somewhere I can continue to grow and develop.</p><p>I also have a background in biosciences - with a master's in systems and synthetic biology, so somewhere within the biotech sector would be a good fit for me. However, I am open to anywhere I would get the opportunity to work on interesting problems.</p><p>If I sound like a good fit for any of your roles, please do reach out!</p></div></td></tr>

I'm a recent graduate from NJIT, and I'm looking to get my first full-time position in SWE. I have some Intern experience as a Frontend Developer, which was through a capstone course from which I received an Advanced Letter of Recommendation.</p><p>I prefer Backend Development, but I still enjoy Frontend, Full-Stack and other areas of SWE. My experience ranges from working on pre-existing internal applications to designing a full-stack application in a group project that ran on a small cluster of VMs.</p><p>I find myself having the most fun when I'm facing down problems with no clear solution. I've never been comfortable with knowing 'just enough', and since I first began programming in High School my skills have been largely influenced by my drive towards self-improvement and outdoing my past self.</p></div></td></tr>

              <p>
                Ladybird is a brand-new browser &amp; web engine. Driven by a
                web standards first approach, Ladybird aims to render the
                modern web with good performance, stability and security.
              </p>
              <p>
                From its humble beginnings as an HTML viewer for the SerenityOS
                hobby operating system project, Ladybird has since grown into a
                cross-platform browser supporting Linux, macOS, and other
                Unix-like systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ladybird is currently in heavy development. We are targeting a
                first Alpha release for early adopters in 2026.

                  We currently have 4 paid full-time engineers working on
                  Ladybird. There is also a large community of volunteer contributors.

                  We have 3 new full-time engineers starting soon. Going
                  forward, we would like to grow the team at a reasonable pace.
                  Building the right team is more important than building it
                  quickly.
                </p>
              </div>

            <div><p>
                  The focus of the Ladybird project is to build a new browser
                  engine from the ground up. We don't use code from Blink,
                  WebKit, Gecko, or any other browser engine.
                  </p><p>
                  For historical reasons, the browser uses various libraries
                  from the SerenityOS project, which has a strong culture of
                  writing <i>everything</i> from scratch.
                  Now that Ladybird has forked from SerenityOS, it is no longer
                  bound by this culture, and we will be making use of 3rd party
                  libraries for common functionality (e.g image/audio/video formats,
                  encryption, graphics, etc.)
                  </p><p>
                  We are already using some of the same 3rd party libraries
                  that other browsers use, but we will never adopt another
                  browser engine instead of building our own.
                </p></div>

            <div><p>
                  We don't have anyone actively working on Windows support, and
                  there are considerable changes required to make it work well
                  outside a Unix-like environment.
                  </p><p>
                  We would like to do Windows eventually, but it's not a priority
                  at the moment.
                </p></div>

            <div><p>
                  We don't have anyone actively working on an Android or iOS port.
                  More effort will be put into mobile once we have the desktop versions in a good state.
                  </p><p>
                  While there is the start of an Android port in the project repository,
                  mobile is not a priority at the moment.

            <div><p>
                  Ladybird started as a component of the SerenityOS hobby project, which only allows C++.
                  The choice of language was not so much a technical decision, but more one of personal convenience.
                  Andreas was most comfortable with C++ when creating SerenityOS, and now we have almost half
                  a million lines of modern C++ to maintain.
                  </p><p>
                  However, now that Ladybird has forked and become its own independent project,
                  all constraints previously imposed by SerenityOS are no longer in effect.
                  We are actively evaluating a number of alternatives and will
                  be adding a mature successor language to the project in the near future.
                  This process is already quite far along, and prototypes exist in
                  multiple languages.

	<div>
		<p>As someone who has used a static site generator every day at work for years I am on the threshold of believing “actually just writing HTML by hand is probably easier”</p>
<p>This becomes obvious when you eg get a new work machine and need to set up the site generator on the new machine and realize that the exact series of bits you had on disk on the old machine were different than what you can achieve on the new machine. And as a result the site generator doesn’t work even though the setup is “the same”</p>
<p>This state of affairs is also known as “<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4&amp;pp=ygUSdGhlIG1lc3Mgd2UncmUgaW4g">the mess we’re in</a>”</p>
<p>Do you enjoy debugging programming language installations? What about the language’s package ecosystem? What about the language’s deployment model (or lack thereof)? Congratulations, you now get to be a sysadmin who has to care about all of these things. This is a mile high mountain of dependencies to be dealing with all just to avoid having to type a few brackets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile if a web site is maintained as just a folder of HTML files I could do a “git clone” and be up and running already in Emacs’ lovely <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/nxml-mode.html">nxml mode</a> or for that matter <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-ragtag">tpope’s ragtag</a> which I’ve also used extensively- and it’s excellent. Do autoformatting on save with <a href="https://github.com/someth2say/xmlformat">xmlformat</a></p>
<p>To sum up, for long term ease of maintenance I’m coming to believe it’s wise to prefer static DATA that is maintained in a specified validated format over changing, dynamic CODE that keeps changing and breaking, and in all probability you don’t actually control it anyway, <a href="https://www.softwaremaxims.com/blog/not-a-supplier">you just picked it up by the side of the road</a></p>
<p>(This grew out of a little complaint at <a href="https://mastodon.social/@rmloveland/112700265946114818">https://mastodon.social/@rmloveland/112700265946114818</a>)</p>

      <p>Many programs that we write can be embedded in recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
For such programs, a trained RNN can perform better than if we write the algorithm by hand, refining it via trial and error.
I walk through an example in detail.</p>

</p><p>Is this Python code or a neural network? They are one and the same.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Humans are bad at managing spaghetti code.
Of course, we should try and avoid writing spaghetti code if we can.
But there are problems that are so ill-specified that any serious attempt to solve them results in just that.</p>
<p>Let me make this concrete.
In research projects, we often write programs that extract information from raw data.
The data may have idiosyncrasies and follow no clear specification.
Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Identify mentions of corporations and their officers in news articles.
</li>
<li>
Label public procurement contracts by what kind of service the firms supply.
</li>
<li>
Determine if a message exchanged between engineers contains program code.
</li>
</ul>
<p>If we want the output to be perfect—at least in the limit—then we need to exhaustively examine each observation.
We can go one step further to reassure ourselves that the program produces the correct output by picking representative examples and writing unit tests for them.
Almost every programming language has libraries for this, including <a href="https://testthat.r-lib.org/">R</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">Python</a>.</p>
<p>But this approach won’t work well if getting the correct output requires that we specify complicated decision rules.
In the examples above,</p>
<ul>
<li>
corporate officers might be mentioned in the news by nickname,
</li>
<li>
contracts might describe the procured services using synonyms, and
</li>
<li>
it might not always be trivial to tell apart program code from English.
</li>
</ul>
<p>In such situations, we might be better off training a neural network.
Algorithms that train neural networks thrive on spaghetti.</p>
<h2 id="detecting-program-code-in-messages">Detecting program code in messages</h2>
<p>In this post, the problem that I’ll walk through solving is this:
<em>how can we detect if a message sent during code review explicitly refers to program code?</em>
Let’s suppose that the code base that we observe is written in C, and that the following examples are representative of the messages that engineers send:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>
<em>LGTM with <mark>render_ipa_alloc()</mark>.</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>If the <mark>FTPSACK</mark> flag is set, then use a prespecified value.</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>AFAICT there is nothing else to check (unless you can think of something).</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>Actually, <mark>debug_error()</mark> doesn’t return <mark>NULL</mark>, so we should use <mark>IS_ERROR()</mark> here.</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>This fails to build on aarch64 even though it works without issue on amd64.</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>I’ve added <mark>if (err) goto cleanup;</mark> but the code still leaks.</em>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The highlighted expressions are program-code references that we would like to detect.</p>
<h3 id="ideas-for-decision-rules">Ideas for decision rules</h3>
<p>We take a straightforward approach and look for decision rules that can tell apart program code from ordinary English.
Here are some simple ideas:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>#</th>
<th>Rule</th>
<th>True positive</th>
<th>False positive</th>
<th>False negative</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Word followed by parentheses is code.</td>
<td>A and D</td>
<td>–</td>
<td>B and F</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>All-caps word is code.</td>
<td>B and D</td>
<td>C</td>
<td>A and F</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Non-English word is code.</td>
<td>A, B, and D</td>
<td>C, E, and F</td>
<td>–</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>None of these rules is perfect: each has false positives or false negatives or both.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Rule 1 is easy to implement but it misses obvious positive cases like <code>if (err) goto cleanup;</code>.
</li>
<li>
Rule 2 mistakenly classifies capitalized acronyms as program code.
To make this rule effective, we need to complement it with an extensive list of acronyms and abbreviations that we might encounter (e.g., <em>AFAICT, LGTM, USD, COVID</em>).
</li>
<li>
Rule 3 mistakenly classifies engineering jargon as program code.
To make this rule work, we need an even longer word list than for Rule 2.
We can start with a canonical list of English words, but we need to complement it both with acronyms and with words that commonly appear in software engineering, like <em>aarch64</em> and <em>amd64.</em>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-hand-written-algorithm">A hand-written algorithm</h3>
<p>Nevertheless, we reason that a simple algorithm might do well enough.
So we set out to write a program that implements Rule 1.
Our program will decide in two steps whether a message contains code:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Preprocessing:</strong> convert the message into a sequence of tokens.
The tokens are chosen so that they capture syntactic elements of C program code.
This is the information that we need to apply Rule 1.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Inference:</strong> apply a function to the token sequence to check if the sequence satisfies the rule.
If it does, then we conclude that the message contains valid C code.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s take the first example sentence from before.
We could encode it as a sequence of eight tokens:<a id="fnref1" href="#fn1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><img id="lgtm_tokens" src="https://blog.gabornyeki.com/2024-07-my-python-code-is-a-neural-network/figure_tokens_step_8.svg" width="600">
<img id="lgtm_tokens_dark" src="https://blog.gabornyeki.com/2024-07-my-python-code-is-a-neural-network/figure_tokens_step_8_dark.svg" width="600">
<br>


</p>
<p>Rule 1 says that the token sequence <code>underscore_identifier</code>–<code>open_paren</code>–<code>close_paren</code> indicates the presence of program code in the sentence.
Let’s write a classifier in Python that detects a sequence like this.</p>
<p>First, we set up the types.
For simplicity, we model tokens as strings.
In order to keep track of the tokens that we have seen in the sequence, we also define a <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0557/">data class</a> called <code>State</code>:</p>
<pre data-linenos="" data-lang="py"><code data-lang="py"><table><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><span><span><span>from</span></span><span><span> <span><span>dataclasses</span></span> <span><span>import</span></span></span></span><span></span><span> <span>dataclass</span></span>
</span></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><span>
</span></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><span><span><span>Token</span></span> <span>=</span> <span><span>str</span></span>    </span></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><span>
</span></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><span><span><span>@</span><span><span><span>dataclass</span></span></span></span>
</span></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><span><span><span><span>class</span></span> <span><span>State</span></span><span>:</span></span>
</span></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td><span>    <span><span>previous_was_identifier</span></span><span>:</span> <span><span>bool</span></span> <span>=</span> <span>False</span>
</span></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td><span>    <span><span>previous_was_open_paren</span></span><span>:</span> <span><span>bool</span></span> <span>=</span> <span>False</span>
</span></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td><span>    <span><span>previous_previous_was_identifier</span></span><span>:</span> <span><span>bool</span></span> <span>=</span> <span>False</span>
</span></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td><span>    <span><span>seen_code</span></span><span>:</span> <span><span>bool</span></span> <span>=</span> <span>False</span>
</span></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
<p>To classify a message, we write a function called <code>contains_code</code> that returns <code>True</code> if the message satisfies Rule 1.
The function decides this by iterating over the token sequence and checking at each element whether the rule applies.
Since applying the rule means checking three <em>consecutive</em> tokens, not just one token, we need to keep a memory of what tokens we have seen earlier in the sequence.
The function <code>contains_code</code> keeps this memory inside an instance of <code>State</code>:</p>
<pre data-linenos="" data-lang="py"><code data-lang="py"><table><tbody><tr><td>12</td><td><span><span><span>from</span></span><span><span> <span><span>typing</span></span> <span><span>import</span></span></span></span><span></span><span> <span>Iterable</span></span>
</span></td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td><span>
</span></td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td><span><span><span><span>def</span></span> <span><span>contains_code</span></span></span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>tokens</span></span><span><span>:</span> <span><span><span>Iterable</span></span></span><span><span>[</span></span><span><span><span>Token</span></span></span><span><span>]</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span> </span><span><span>-&gt;</span> <span><span>bool</span></span></span><span><span>:</span></span>
</span></td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td><span>    <span><span>state</span></span> <span>=</span> <span><span><span><span>State</span></span></span></span><span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span>
</span></td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td><span>
</span></td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td><span>    <span><span>for</span> <span>token</span> <span>in</span></span><span> <span><span>tokens</span></span></span><span><span>:</span></span>

</span></td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td><span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>seen_code</span></span>
</span></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
<p>Now we are ready to implement <code>process</code>.
This is where we check if the rule applies and maintain the state:</p>
<pre data-linenos="" data-lang="py"><code data-lang="py"><table><tbody><tr><td>22</td><td><span><span><span><span>def</span></span> <span><span>process</span></span></span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>state</span></span><span><span>:</span> <span><span>State</span></span></span><span><span>,</span> <span>token</span></span><span><span>:</span> <span><span>Token</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span> </span><span><span>-&gt;</span> <span><span>State</span></span></span><span><span>:</span></span>

<p>And with that, we have a classifier that implements Rule 1.
Let’s see how well it performs by looking at its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall">precision and recall</a>.
The good news:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The code is simple.
</li>
<li>
It has no false positives.
</li>
<li>
It has a precision of 100 percent on our (completely made up) examples.
</li>
</ol>
<p>The bad news is that this classifier has a high false negative rate which leads to a recall of only 50 percent.</p>
<p>If we want to increase recall and add Rule 2 to the algorithm, then the code becomes more complex: we need to add more fields to the <code>State</code> class, and more <code>if</code>/<code>elif</code>/<code>else</code> statements and related housekeeping to <code>process</code>.
If we want to further refine any of the rules, then we need to add yet more complexity.</p>
<p>We see that tweaking the algorithm by hand to find improvements can get out of control.
It can easily result in spaghetti code that will be a struggle to maintain.
How can we do better?</p>
<h2 id="neural-networks-to-the-rescue">Neural networks to the rescue</h2>
<p>Mired in our predicament, we reflect on the fact that <code>contains_code</code> and <code>process</code> are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">state machine</a>.
This fact is notable because state machines can be encoded by recurrent neural networks (RNNs).<a id="fnref2" href="#fn2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
So rather than tweaking the algorithm by hand, we could find a better algorithm by training an RNN on our examples.</p>
<h3 id="the-general-idea">The general idea</h3>
<p>At a high level, an RNN is an approximation of the conditional probability
<span>\[\Pr({\rm MessageContainsCode} = 1 \mid {\rm Token}_1 = x_1, \ldots, {\rm Token}_T = x_T).\]</span>
This approximation is calculated by processing the token sequence element by element.
For each token, we calculate a vector that does what <code>State</code> did in our Python code.
This is usually called a <em>hidden</em> state because it is only an interim variable and appears in neither the input nor the output of the model.
We get it by taking into account the previous state:
<span>\[\begin{aligned}
{\rm State}_0 &amp;:= 0 \in \mathbb{R}^S \\
{\rm State}_1 &amp;:= f({\rm Token}_1, {\rm State}_0) \\
{\rm State}_2 &amp;:= f({\rm Token}_2, {\rm State}_1) \\
&amp;\;\;\vdots \\
{\rm State}_T &amp;:= f({\rm Token}_T, {\rm State}_{T-1}) \\
\end{aligned}\]</span>
where the function <span>\(f\)</span> represents the hidden layers of the recurrent network.
The message is classified based on the final state:
<span>\[\widehat{\Pr}({\rm MessageContainsCode} = 1 \mid {\rm Token}_1, \ldots) := g({\rm State}_T)\]</span>
where <span>\(g\)</span> is what is called the output layer of the network.</p>
<p>How should we parameterize the functions <span>\(f\)</span> and <span>\(g\)</span>?</p>
<h3 id="our-python-code-as-math">Our Python code as math</h3>
<p>Let’s think about what a network that encodes Rule 1 looks like.
Returning to the previous example sentence, let’s simplify the math that ensues by using fewer types of tokens:</p>
<p><img id="lgtm_tokens_simple" src="https://blog.gabornyeki.com/2024-07-my-python-code-is-a-neural-network/figure_tokens_simple_step_8.svg" width="520">

</p>
<p>Each token in the sentence is represented as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot">binary vector</a>, so the input data that we get looks like this (with the zeros erased to make the table easier to read):</p>

<p>To model the state, we need to add three hidden layers to the network.
When we are processing the <span>\(t\)</span>-th token in the sequence, we calculate each of the three layers, one after the other.
Let’s denote the first layer by <span>\(h_t^1\)</span>, the second layer by <span>\(h_t^2\)</span>, and the third by <span>\(h_t^3\)</span>.
The first two layers hold intermediate calculations while the third layer holds our final state after processing the token.</p>
<p>The third layer, <span>\(h_t^3\)</span>, corresponds to <span>\({\rm State}_t\)</span> in the schematic presentation above, and the initial state, <span>\(h_0^3\)</span>, corresponds to <span>\({\rm State}_0\)</span>.
This table shows how the hidden state evolves:</p>

<p>To encode the hand-written algorithm, we use the binary indicator function, <span>\(\mathbb{1}\{\cdot &gt; 0\}\)</span>, which evaluates to 1 if its input is positive and to 0 otherwise.<a id="fnref3" href="#fn3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
Of course, this would be an outstandingly bad choice if we wanted to <em>train</em> an RNN because its derivative is zero almost everywhere which breaks gradient descent.
But for now, we merely want to <em>specify</em> an RNN that mimics the hand-written algorithm.
The <code>State</code> class that we used is effectively a binary vector, and the binary indicator function ensures that the RNN’s hidden layers will be binary as well.</p>
<p>The key calculation is done in the second and third hidden layers.
The second layer checks if the token sequence <span>\((x_{t-2}, x_{t-1}, x_t)\)</span> satisfies Rule 1.
We don’t do this by referencing the three tokens directly.
Instead, we store information about them in the first hidden layer, and we reference that:</p>
<p><span>\[\begin{aligned}
h_{t,\tt this\_is\_code}^2 &amp;:= \mathbb{1}\left\{ 2 h_{t,\tt pp\_identifier}^1 h_{t,\tt p\_open\_paren}^1 h_{t,\tt close\_paren}^1 - 1 &gt; 0 \right\} \\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The third layer combines this check, <span>\(h_{t,\tt this\_is\_code}^2\)</span>, with a memory of whether any earlier part of the sequence has satisfied the rule:</p>
<p><span>\[\begin{aligned}
h_{t,\tt seen\_code}^3 &amp;:= \mathbb{1}\left\{ 2 \left( h_{t, \tt this\_is\_code}^2 + h_{t, \tt p\_seen\_code}^2 \right) - 1 &gt; 0 \right\} \\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Once we have processed all <span>\(T\)</span> tokens, the output is calculated using the final hidden layer:</p>
<p><span>\[y_T := \mathbb{1}\left\{ 2 h_{T,\tt seen\_code}^3 - 1 &gt; 0 \right\}\]</span></p>
<p>The formula for <span>\(h_{t,\tt this\_is\_code}^2\)</span> looks simple enough but it contains a multiplication between <span>\(h_{t,\tt pp\_identifier}^1\)</span>, <span>\(h_{t,\tt p\_open\_paren}^1\)</span>, and <span>\(h_{t,\tt close\_paren}^1\)</span>.
If we wanted to include this multiplicative term, we would need a higher-order RNN, similar to the second-order RNN that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1992.4.3.393">Giles et al. (1992)</a> used to discover state machines.
Fortunately, with binary hidden layers, we can stay within the framework of a first-order RNN by replacing the multiplication with a simple sum:</p>
<p><span>\[\begin{aligned}
h_{t,\tt this\_is\_code}^2 &amp;:= \mathbb{1}\left\{ h_{t,\tt pp\_identifier}^1 + h_{t,\tt p\_open\_paren}^1 + h_{t,\tt close\_paren}^1 - 2 &gt; 0 \right\} \\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>(And when we will change the activation function in the next section so that we can train the network, we will see that a sum still works.)</p>
<p>Now to wrap things up, we also get some auxiliary calculations done that are needed for <span>\(h_{t,\tt this\_is\_code}^2\)</span> and <span>\(h_{t,\tt seen\_code}^3\)</span>.
In the first hidden layer, we take note of the token that we are processing and copy the previous state:</p>
<p><span>\[\begin{aligned}
h_{t,\tt identifier}^1 &amp;:= \mathbb{1}\{ 2 x_{t,\tt identifier} - 1 &gt; 0 \} \\
h_{t,\tt open\_paren}^1 &amp;:= \mathbb{1}\{ 2 x_{t,\tt open\_paren} - 1 &gt; 0 \} \\
h_{t,\tt close\_paren}^1 &amp;:= \mathbb{1}\{ 2 x_{t,\tt close\_paren} - 1 &gt; 0 \} \\
h_{t,\tt p\_seen\_code}^1 &amp;:= \mathbb{1}\{ 2 h_{t-1,\tt seen\_code}^3 - 1 &gt; 0 \} \\
h_{t,\tt p\_identifier}^1 &amp;:= \mathbb{1}\{ 2 h_{t-1,\tt identifier}^3 - 1 &gt; 0 \} \\
h_{t,\tt p\_open\_paren}^1 &amp;:= \mathbb{1}\{ 2 h_{t-1,\tt open\_paren}^3 - 1 &gt; 0 \} \\
h_{t,\tt pp\_identifier}^1 &amp;:= \mathbb{1}\{ 2 h_{t-1,\tt p\_identifier}^3 - 1 &gt; 0 \} \\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>In the second layer, we copy some values that will be used in the third:</p>
<p><span>\[\begin{aligned}
h_{t,\tt identifier}^2 &amp;:= \mathbb{1}\left\{ 2 h_{t,\tt identifier}^1 - 1 &gt; 0 \right\} \\
h_{t,\tt open\_paren}^2 &amp;:= \mathbb{1}\left\{ 2 h_{t,\tt open\_paren}^1 - 1 &gt; 0 \right\} \\
h_{t,\tt p\_seen\_code}^2 &amp;:= \mathbb{1}\left\{ 2 h_{t,\tt p\_seen\_code}^1 - 1 &gt; 0 \right\} \\
h_{t,\tt p\_identifier}^2 &amp;:= \mathbb{1}\left\{ 2 h_{t,\tt p\_identifier}^1 - 1 &gt; 0 \right\} \\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>And lastly, in the third layer, we maintain a memory of tokens that we can use later when we process the next token, <span>\(x_{t+1}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span>\[\begin{aligned}
h_{t,\tt identifier}^3 &amp;:= \mathbb{1}\left\{ 2 h_{t,\tt identifier}^2 - 1 &gt; 0 \right\} \\
h_{t,\tt open\_paren}^3 &amp;:= \mathbb{1}\left\{ 2 h_{t,\tt open\_paren}^2 - 1 &gt; 0 \right\} \\
h_{t,\tt p\_identifier}^3 &amp;:= \mathbb{1}\left\{ 2 h_{t,\tt p\_identifier}^2 - 1 &gt; 0 \right\} \\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The <a href="#lgtm_rnn_display">illustration at the beginning of the post</a> shows how this network classifies the example sentence.
I won’t do it in this post, but we could set it up in PyTorch, too, and verify that it classifies messages exactly as our hand-written algorithm does.</p>
<h2 id="training-the-network-to-discover-better-algorithms">Training the network to discover better algorithms</h2>
<p>If we have a recurrent network, then we should be able to train it.
But the network as we have parameterized it so far is not amenable to training.
Gradient descent, the algorithm that is commonly used to train neural networks, will be stuck because the binary indicator function has a zero slope almost everywhere.</p>
<h3 id="trainable-activation-functions">Trainable activation functions</h3>
<p>We overcome this hurdle by switching to an activation function called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_%28neural_networks%29">rectified linear unit</a> (ReLU), defined as <span>\([x]^+ := x \mathbb{1}\{ x &gt; 0\}\)</span>.
The numerical constants, called <em>weights</em> and <em>biases,</em> also need to be replaced, as these are the parameters that gradient descent will estimate.
We end up with</p>
<p><span>\[\begin{aligned}
h_{t,\tt this\_is\_code}^2 &amp;:= \big[ w_{\tt pp\_identifier}^2 h_{t,\tt pp\_identifier}^1 + \\
&amp;\qquad\quad+ w_{\tt p\_open\_paren}^2 h_{t,\tt p\_open\_paren}^1 + \\
&amp;\qquad\quad+ w_{\tt close\_paren}^2 h_{t,\tt close\_paren}^1 + b_{\tt this\_is\_code}^2 \big]^+ \\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>and so on for the hidden layers.
For the output layer, we use a sigmoid activation function:</p>
<p><span>\[y_T := \frac{1}{ 1 + \exp\left( - w_{\tt seen\_code}^y h_{T,\tt seen\_code}^3 - b_{\tt seen\_code}^y \right) }.\]</span></p>
<p>And we are ready to plug this into PyTorch and train it.</p>
<p>However, what we will find if we do that is that while it is possible to get this network to learn something from the data, its performance is far from exceptional.
We can tackle the code detection problem more effectively if we use some of the other options offered by PyTorch.</p>
<h3 id="architectures-with-more-efficient-implementations">Architectures with more efficient implementations</h3>
<p>One reason for the lackluster performance of our recurrent network is that its architecture is somewhat atypical.
As a consequence, more of our training procedure is executed in Python glue code and less of it in PyTorch’s C++ library.
An alternative that is <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.RNN.html">provided off the shelf</a> by PyTorch, and that thus has a more efficient implementation, is the Elman RNN.
Our architecture differs from Elman’s in that in our network, each hidden layer takes only the previous layer as input: the first layer for token <span>\(t\)</span> takes the third layer for token <span>\(t-1\)</span>, the second layer takes the first, and the third layer takes the second.
In vector notation:</p>
<p><span>\[\begin{aligned}
h_t^1 &amp;:= \left[ w^1 \left( x_t', {h_{t-1}^3}' \right)' + b^1 \right]^+ \\
h_t^2 &amp;:= \left[ w^2 h_t^1 + b^2 \right]^+ \\
h_t^3 &amp;:= \left[ w^3 h_t^2 + b^3 \right]^+ \\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>If we followed Elman’s architecture, the layers would be different in two ways.
First, each hidden layer for token <span>\(t\)</span> would also take the same layer for token <span>\(t-1\)</span> as input.
Second, the first hidden layer would <em>not</em> take the final layer for the previous taken as input.
This becomes clearer when we compare the formulas shown above with those of the Elman RNN:</p>
<p><span>\[\begin{aligned}
h_t^1 &amp;:= \left[ w^1 \left( x_t', {h_{t-1}^1}' \right)' + b^1 \right]^+ \\
h_t^2 &amp;:= \left[ w^2 \left( {h_t^1}', {h_{t-1}^2}' \right)' + b^2 \right]^+ \\
h_t^3 &amp;:= \left[ w^3 \left( {h_t^2}', {h_{t-1}^3}' \right)' + b^3 \right]^+ \\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<h3 id="architectures-with-more-numerically-stable-gradients">Architectures with more numerically stable gradients</h3>
<p>Another reason for the subpar performance of our recurrent network is that in real-world code review, engineers often send longer messages.
Longer messages translate into longer token sequences which can throw off the gradient descent algorithm.
Gradient descent works in theory but not always in practice: the gradients, obtained by diligently applying the chain rule, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem">can get too close to zero</a> which causes problems with numerical stability.</p>
<p>While Elman’s architecture is susceptible, too, other architectures attempt to mitigate this.
So we might well find that a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gated_recurrent_unit">gated recurrent unit</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory">long short term memory network</a> performs better for our code detection task.</p>
<h2 id="data-driven-discipline">Data-driven discipline</h2>
<p>Recurrent neural networks have handled our inevitable spaghetti code better than we could ourselves.
But they have done more than that: they have imposed a certain data-driven discipline on us that we would probably not follow if we wrote the algorithm by hand.
To train a network,</p>
<ol>
<li>
we need to select training and validation data sets,
</li>
<li>
we need to prelabel them, and
</li>
<li>
we need to specify a loss function that makes it explicit what we want the classifier to achieve and what we don’t.
</li>
</ol>
<p>This discipline forces us to clarify our thinking, as we will inevitably find gray areas that we didn’t expect.
And it turns out that this discipline is useful even for those problems that we decide to solve by hand.</p>

<p>The first word, “LGTM,” is a commonly used abbreviation of “looks good to me.”
Why is it coded as <code>all_caps_identifier</code> rather than something else?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>A database does not need a write-ahead log (WAL) to achieve
durability. A database can write its long-term data structure durably
to disk before returning to a client. Granted, this is a bad idea! And
granted, a WAL <b>is</b> critical for durability <b>by design</b> in most
databases. But I think it's helpful to understand WALs by
understanding what you <b>could</b> do without them.</p>
<p>So let's look at what terrible design we can make for a durable
database that has no write-ahead log. To motivate the idea of, and
build an intuition for, a write-ahead log.</p>
<p>Thank you to Alex Miller for reviewing a version of this post.</p>
<p>But first, what is durability?</p>
<h3 id="durability">Durability</h3><p>Durability happens in the context of a request a client makes to a
data system (either an embedded system like SQLite or RocksDB or a
standalone system like Postgres). Durability is a spectrum of
guarantees the server provides when a client requests to write some
data: that either the request succeeds and the data is safely written
to disk, or the request fails and the client must retry or decide to
do something else.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to set an absolute definition for durability since
different databases have different concepts of what can go wrong with
disks (also called a "storage fault model"), or they have no concept
at all.</p>
<p>Let's start from the beginning.</p>
<h4 id="an-in-memory-database">An in-memory database</h4><p>An in-memory database has no durability at all. Here is pseudo-code
for an in-memory database service.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db</span> <span>=</span> <span>btree</span><span>()</span>

<span>def</span> <span>handle_write</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>):</span>

</pre></div>
<p>Throughout this post, for the sake of code brevity, imagine that the
environment is concurrent and that data races around shared mutable
values like <code>db</code> are protected somehow.</p>
<h4 id="writing-to-disk">Writing to disk</h4><p>If we want to achieve the most basic level of durability, we can write
this database to a file.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>"kv.db"</span><span>)</span>

</pre></div>
<p><code>btree.write_to_disk</code> will call
<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/pwrite">pwrite(2)</a> under the hood. And
we'll assume it does copy-on-write for only changed pages. So imagine
we have a large database represented by a btree that takes up 10GiB on
disk. With the btree algorithm, if we write a single entry to the
btree, often only a single (often 4Kib) page will get written rather
than all pages (holding all values) in the tree. At the same time, in
the worst case, the entire tree (all 10GiB of data) may need to get
rewritten.</p>
<p>But this code isn't crash-safe. If the virtual or physical machine
this code is running on reboots, the data we wrote to the file may not
actually be on disk.</p>
<h4 id="fsync">fsync</h4><p>File data is buffered by the operating system by default. By general
consensus, writing data without flushing the operating system buffer
is not considered durable. Every so often a new database will show up
on Hacker News claiming to beat all other databases on insert speed
until a commenter points out the new database doesn't actually flush
data to disk.</p>
<p>In other words, the commonly accepted requirement for durability is
that not only do you write data to a file on disk but you
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fsync.2.html">fsync(2)</a> the
file you wrote. This forces the operating system to flush to disk any
data it has buffered.</p>

<p>Furthermore you must not ignore fsync failure. How you deal with fsync
failure is up to you, but exiting immediately with a message that the
user should restore from a backup is sometimes considered acceptable.</p>
<p>Databases don't like to fsync because it's slow. Many major databases
offer modes where they do not fsync data files before returning a
success to a client. Postgres
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-FSYNC">offers</a>
this unsafe mode, though does not default to it and warns against
it. And MongoDB defaults to this unsafe mode. See
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/configuration-options/#mongodb-setting-storage.journal.commitIntervalMs">storage.journal.commitIntervalMs</a>
and the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/write-concern/#j-option"><code>j</code> write concern
option</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The j option requests acknowledgment from MongoDB that the write
operation has been written to the on-disk journal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MongoDB defaults to committing on an interval, returning a success to
the client potentially before the write has been fsync-ed.</p>
<p>This isn't particularly a dig on MongoDB. Almost every database trades
safety for performance in some regard. For example, few databases but
SQLite and Cockroach default to Serializable Isolation. While it is
commonly agreed that basically no level below Serializable Isolation
(that all other databases default to) can be reasoned about. Other
databases offer Serializable Isolation, they just don't default to
it. Because it can be slow.</p>
<h4 id="group-commit">Group commit</h4><p>But let's get back to fsync. One way to amortize the cost of fsync is
to delay requests so that you write data from each of them and then
fsync the data from all requests. This is sometimes called group
commit.</p>
<p>For example, we could update the database in-memory but have a
background thread serialize to disk and call fsync only every 5ms.</p>

<p>Although it might sound similar to what MongoDB does, the critical
difference is that <code>handle_write</code> waits to return a success until the
write is durable via fsync.</p>
<p>So to reiterate, the key idea for durability of a client request is
that you have some version of the client message stored on disk
durably with fsync before returning a success to a client.</p>
<p>From now on in this post, when you see "durable" or "durability", it
means that the data has been written and fsync-ed to disk.</p>
<h3 id="optimizing-durable-writes">Optimizing durable writes</h3><p>A key insight is that it's silly to serialize the entire permanent
structure of the database to disk every time a user writes.</p>
<p>We could just write the user's message itself to an append-only
log. And then only periodically write the entire btree to disk. So
long as we have fsync-ed the append-only log file, we can safely
return to the user even if the btree itself has not yet been written
to disk.</p>
<p>The additional logic this requires is that on startup we must read the
btree from disk and then replay the log on top of the btree.</p>

</pre></div>
<p>This is a write-ahead log!</p>
<p>Consider a few scenarios. One request writes the smallest key ever
seen. And one request within the same millisecond writes the largest
key ever seen. Writing these to disk on the btree means modifying at
least two pages spread out in space on disk.</p>
<p>But if we only have to durably write these two messages to a log, they
can likely both be included in the same log page. ("Likely" so long as
key and values are small enough that multiple can fit into the same
page.)</p>
<p>That is, it's cheaper to write only these small messages representing
the client request to disk. And we save the structured btree
persistence for a less frequent durable write.</p>
<h3 id="filesystem-and-disk-bugs">Filesystem and disk bugs</h3><p>Sometimes filesystems will write data to the wrong place. Sometimes
disks corrupt data. A solution to both of these is to checksum the
data on write, store the checksum on disk, and confirm the checksum on
read. This combined with a background process called scrubbing to
validate unread data can help you learn quickly when your data has
been corrupted and you must recover from backup.</p>
<p>MongoDB's default storage engine WiredTiger <b>does</b> checksum data <a href="https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger/blob/develop/src/docs/tune-checksum.dox#L3">by
default</a>.</p>
<p>But some databases famous for integrity do not. Postgres does <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/checksums.html">no data
checksumming</a>
by default:</p>
<blockquote><p>By default, data pages are not protected by checksums, but this can
optionally be enabled for a cluster. When enabled, each data page
includes a checksum that is updated when the page is written and
verified each time the page is read. Only data pages are protected by
checksums; internal data structures and temporary files are not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SQLite likewise does no checksumming by default. Checksumming is an
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/cksumvfs.html">optional extension</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The checksum VFS extension is a VFS shim that adds an 8-byte
checksum to the end of every page in an SQLite database. The checksum
is added as each page is written and verified as each page is
read. The checksum is intended to help detect database corruption
caused by random bit-flips in the mass storage device.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But even this isn't perfect. Disks and nodes can fail completely. At
that point you can only improve durability by introducing redundancy
across disks (and/or nodes), for example, via distributed consensus.</p>
<h3 id="other-reasons-you-<em>need</em>-a-wal?">Other reasons you <em>need</em> a WAL?</h3><p>Some databases (like SQLite) require a write-ahead log to implement
aspects of ACID transactions. But this need not be a requirement for
ACID transactions if you do MVCC (SQLite does not). See my previous
post on <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-05-16-mvcc.html">implementing
MVCC</a> for details.</p>
<p>Logical replication (also called change data capture (CDC)) is another
interesting feature that requires a write-ahead log. The idea is that
the log already preserves the exact order and changes that affect the
database's "state machine". So we could copy these changes out of the
system by tracking the write-ahead log, preserving change order, and
apply these changes to a foreign system.</p>
<p>But again, just CDC is not about durability. It's an ancillary feature
that write-ahead logs make simple.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>A few key points. One, durability primarily matters if it is
established before returning a success to the client. Second, a
write-ahead log is a cheap way to get durability.</p>
<p>And finally, durability is a spectrum. You need to read the docs for
your database to understand what it does and does not.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here's a new post about durability and write-ahead logs. Write-ahead logs are used almost everywhere. But to build an intuition for why, it is helpful to imagine what you would do without a WAL. And to explore the meaning of durability.<a href="https://t.co/nzS2pMz22z">https://t.co/nzS2pMz22z</a> <a href="https://t.co/m1n9x8CNcp">pic.twitter.com/m1n9x8CNcp</a></p>— Phil Eaton (@eatonphil) <a href="https://twitter.com/eatonphil/status/1807741130093556098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://mlops.systems/posts/2024-06-25-evaluation-finetuning-manual-dataset.html">My last post</a> outlined the kinds of evaluation I need and want to understand how well my finetuned LLM is performing in the task of structured data extraction from press releases. Let’s start with the core metric I’m interested in, accuracy, and then later we can dive into some of the other evaluation metrics as well.</p>
<section id="tldr">
<h2 data-anchor-id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>The headline for this post could well have been: finetuned models beat OpenAI, but evals were a bit painful to implement. There’s a lot of hidden code here in this post and it was slow to run. This step was the first time during the work for the finetuning course where I felt the pain and tradeoffs around the choice to finetune. I can see that without a system of some kind to handle this, the complexity of maintaining it all will start to mount up. But more on that at the end!</p>
<p>This is a long post with lots of detail. I’ve tried to minimise the amount of code you see, but if you want to see how the charts or evals were done, expand the ‘code’ sections. If you’re interested in cutting straight to the aggregate results, <a href="#final-aggregate-scores-for-the-models">click here</a> to go to the end of this post. (To see the rest of the blog posts about this project, please click <a href="https://mlops.systems/index.html#category=isafpr">here</a>. Some context: I’m doing some finetuning as part of <a href="https://maven.com/parlance-labs/fine-tuning">the Hamel Husain / Dan Becker Finetuning course on Maven</a> using <a href="https://mlops.systems/posts/2024-03-24-publishing-afghanistan-dataset-huggingface.html">some data I collected and labeled</a> a few years back that makes for a cool little test of how good it works for structured data extraction.)</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="loading-the-datasets">Loading the datasets</h2>
<p>The data is all available on the Hugging Face Hub in a public repository, and for the purposes of these evaluations I want to use the <code>test</code> split of the dataset since none of our models have seen that data yet so it’s good for determining how well our model performs with new data.</p>

<p>We’ll first add an extra column to our <code>DataFrame</code> and then make a prediction for each and every row in the dataset. We’ll store a copy of the prediction to the column so as to make sure we don’t have to do this compute-intensive step repeatedly.</p>
<p>But first we’ll assemple the data as Pydantic objects so as to handle validation and other quality of life features.</p>

<p>So when we’re making the prediction we’re hoping to get a JSON string like this out from the model:</p>

<p>I’m starting with full evaluations using the GPT models and I’ll need a slightly more elaborate prompt in order to get decent results. I can’t pass in the exact same prompt as the one I used for the finetuned model since the GPT models haven’t been trained or finetuned to respond to those specific prompts. This is sort of an interesting problem to have: how much effort do we put into the GPT prompts to try to get the same level of accuracy as the finetuned model? Or in other words, is there even a way to really compare like to like between models that must accept different prompts?</p>
<p>Let’s try this out for OpenAI GPT-4o and GPT-4 Turbo and see how we get on. You’ll note how long the prompt has to be to give the GPT models a fighting chance against the finetuned models. Ideally I’d stuff in even more examples into the context, but I also don’t want to explode the number of tokens I’m using.</p>

<p>Our model is working (as expected) and we’re also getting a JSON string back. Let’s assemble something that will iterate through all of our test data, get predictions, and then store those predictions on our Pydantic object.</p>
<p>For the bulk predictions, we’ll make sure to do this async, since there are lots of events and we don’t want to waiting all day. You’ll see I also had to add some retries to the function to account for rate limiting on the GPT-3.5-turbo model.</p>

<p>I have all these predictions living in memory right now so it’s probably a good time to commit these to a dataset and push them to the Hugging Face Hub in case the notebook crashes or my local machine shuts down or something else unexpected.</p>
<p>I’ll create a function to handle this as we’ll be repeating this process for the other models as well. It’s a bit verbose but I thought it preferable so you can see what’s going on.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://mlops.systems/posts/2024-06-15-isafpr-first-finetune.html#finetuning-our-model">I noted previously</a>, it was impossible to get the finetuned Mistral model working locally so I did the inference over on Modal where I could spin up a juicy A100 to make the predictions. You’ll see below that the model didn’t perform very well, failing almost all of the evaluations. This is the <code>mistral-lora-templatefree</code> model you’ll see in the charts.</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="finetuned-solar-llm-via-predibase">Finetuned Solar LLM (via Predibase)</h2>
<p>Predibase announced <a href="https://predibase.com/blog/solar-llm-on-predibase-the-best-llm-for-fine-tuning">a new best-in-class model for finetuning</a>, the Solar LLM from Upstage, a week or so ago so I thought I’d try it out. The advantage of this model is that it’s trained to be good at the kinds of tasks people commonly finetune models for, like structured data extraction. As you’ll see below, it did pretty well! <a href="https://huggingface.co/upstage/SOLAR-10.7B-v1.0">The base model is this one</a>, I think, on the Hugging Face Hub so it’s available for you all to use as well.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Qwen2 inference on Predibase is still not working so I’ll skip that finetuned model for the moment.</p>
<p>Now that we have predictions from seven finetuned models and three OpenAI models (to compare against), we can run our evaluations. I’ll start with a simple check to see what proportion of the predictions are even valid JSON.</p>

<p>It’s already instructive to see the difference between the templatefree and the sharegpt template’s ability to generate valid JSON for the TinyLlama finetune. The OpenAI models generate valid JSON every single time, as does the finetuned Mistral and Llama3 models.</p>
<p>While writing the code to evaluate the models, I noticed that some entries were blank or had no predictions at all, so I looked into that next.</p>

<p>So were it not for the missing values, the <code>tinyllama-sharegpt</code> model would have had all 724 predictions, and valid JSON as well.</p>
<p>Now we can get into what we’re really interested in: accuracy. I’ll calculate scores for all the properties where it makes sense for us to have a score and then show the results comparing the models.</p>
<p>These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>start_date</code></li>
<li><code>province</code></li>
<li><code>target_group</code></li>
<li><code>event_type</code></li>
<li><code>min_killed</code></li>
<li><code>min_captured</code></li>
<li><code>killq</code></li>
<li><code>captureq</code></li>
<li><code>killcaptureraid</code></li>
<li><code>airstrike</code></li>
<li><code>noshotsfired</code></li>
<li><code>min_leaders_killed</code></li>
<li><code>min_leaders_captured</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Important note, for all these charts that follow, the total number of tasks was 724, so the numbers are out of a total of 724.</p>

<p>Both Solar and our finetuned GPT3.5 model performed best on predicting which date the event took place. I’m surprised how poorly the OpenAI models did here, actually. And even our best model still got 75 of the dates wrong. This feels like something that I’d want to improve on. Possibly synthetic data could help, or maybe just an improvement in the finetuning prompt as well.</p>

<p>In what will become a theme, the finetuned models actually outperform the OpenAI models, only making a few mistakes. Once again I’m surprised how poorly GPT3.5 did on this task.</p>

<p>Finetuned models doing significantly better than OpenAI for target group identification. I suspect that this would degrade if we added some new groups who weren’t in the training data (as I’d written about <a href="https://mlops.systems/posts/2024-06-25-evaluation-finetuning-manual-dataset.html">in my last post</a>.)</p>

<p>Event type is actually one of the hardest categories since there are actually some semantically overlapping categories and it’s sometimes even hard for a human annotator, but once again the finetuned models do pretty well.</p>

<p>For these number estimations, suddenly the playing fields gets leveled between the finetuned and the OpenAI models. Mistral still comes out on top, but not by much! And it’s impressive how the OpenAI models do really well at this. I suspect this is because of the whole section in the prompt which explained the rubric that was used for annotating the examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Annotation notes: A ‘faciliator’ is not a leader. If a press release states that ‘insurgents’ were detained without further details, assign a minimum number of two detained. Interpret ‘a couple’ as two. Interpret ‘several’ as at least three, even though it may sometimes refer to seven or eight. Classify the terms ‘a few’, ‘some’, ‘a group’, ‘a small group’, and ‘multiple’ as denoting at least three, even if they sometimes refer to larger numbers. Choose the smaller number if no other information is available in the press release to come up with a minimally acceptable figure. Interpret ‘numerous’ and ‘a handful’ as at least four, and ‘a large number’ as at least five.</p>

<p>I’d expect really high accuracy for these boolean attributes, and basically almost all the models were able to give this. Still, our finetuned Mistral still beats out GPT-4o best score.</p>

<p>This is another attribute where it’s clear the lack of signposting in the prompts to the OpenAI models put them at a disadvantage. The term ‘kill-capture raid’ is a term of art and it was used in a specific way for the labelling. OpenAI knows nothing about how I made those calls, which explains why they performed so poorly here.</p>

<p>I’m not quite sure why the OpenAI models are performing in the reverse order of what you’d expect. Recall that the <code>noshotsfired</code> attribute refers to whether the press release states that no shots were fired during a particular raid / event. (For a certain period the press releases were keen to mention this and it was a metric that was particularly useful for ISAF as a public relations gimmick.)</p>
<p>I can think of some semi-anthropomorphizing ways to explain this around how the GPT-4 class of models were ‘overthinking’ the label, but more investigation would be needed to really understand this.</p>

<p>We often hear about how LLMs are bad with numbers, how they <a href="https://gramener.com/llmrandom/">default to certain values</a> and so on, so I was surprised to see such high scores across the board for this task. I imagine this is something that everyone has been trying to improve and it shows. Still, though, our finetuned models do best.</p>

<p>Surprising even me, the finetuned models beat out the GPT-class models from OpenAI. Actually even TinyLlama beats out GPT 3.5 Turbo!</p>
<p>Our top performer was Mistral-7B (finetuned on OpenPipe), very closely followed by Solar LLM and Llama3-7B. Just looking at the scores above it seems like anyone finetuning models for structured data extraction would do well to start of with Mistral-7B, Solar 7B or Llama3-7B and then see which performs best, though with the caveat that they might all be more or less the same for accuracy. There are probably different tradeoffs when it comes to serving the model and the efficiency and latency there, but still these three do really well.</p>
<p>I think if I were to stuff a few more examples into the prompt (as well a bit more explanation and rules) I could get the OpenAI models to perform even better, but at a certain point you have to remember all the things that having your own finetuned model brings you:</p>
<ul>
<li>data privacy (by not sending your confidential information to OpenAI)</li>
<li>smaller models most likely means better performance (though I still have to test and prove that out)</li>
<li>more control overall</li>
<li>cost improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>On the cost, it’s a bit hard to make that comparison or claim right now, especially given the economies of scale that the large cloud providers can rely on, but in a real-world use case where you were building this model for repeated inference over a long-term time frame, then you would have a better chance of having the cost argument make sense, particularly since the only way to make the OpenAI inference calls better to stuff them full of examples and extra explanation, significantly bloating the cost-per-query.</p>
<p>That said, there are some real tradeoffs that come up when finetuning a model, and I’ll get to some of those in my concluding thoughts.</p>
</section>
<section id="finetuning-works-a-charm-but">
<h2>Finetuning works a charm, but…</h2>
<p>First off I’m so pleased that the oft-repeated “finetune your model and get better performance than with GPT-4” actually turned out to be true! And not only was it true, but it was true with <em>relatively</em> little tweaks and adaptations. Remember all the above models are the first finetunes I made with the data I brought. I basically used just the default values for everything and so it worked out of the box.</p>
<p>For any further work I’ll focus on the Solar, Llama3 and Mistral 7B models which performed best. I used cloud finetuning services to finetune the best performing versions of those models, so I’ll want to get that all working locally as well.</p>
<section id="evals-were-a-pain-this-time-round">
<h2 data-anchor-id="evals-were-a-pain-this-time-round">Evals were a pain (this time round)…</h2>
<p>Most of the evaluation work is represented here in this notebook, and that was perhaps the seeds of my own misfortune. I had some models that worked locally, and then a bunch of other models deployed in different environments and with different services.</p>
<p>Not only that, but it was pretty slow to iterate through the 724 row so my test data (which the models hadn’t seen during finetuning, just to be clear) since I implemented it fairly naively.</p>
<p>If I were to now make some updates to the models, or get them working locally, I’d really want to make sure that I have a way to run these evals locally as well. Moreover, I’d want a way to run a subset of the evals (i.e.&nbsp;on a slice of the data) and then at some point switch that out so that they could run across all the data.</p>
<p>All of this is completely within the realm of possible, but for this round I was more focused on getting the results than I was about making the process repeatable and/or efficient. I know I can’t run all the models concurrently on the same machine, so maybe the way forward is simply to have a reliable cloud GPU provider like Modal where I can farm out these evaluations. I had a really good experience with them when I used them, so that’s probably the way forward there.</p>
<p>In general, it was also painful having the models living in different places. I had to remember so many things. In any ideal world, you want a standard interface for inference to all your models, especially if they’re for the same use case or project. It’s convenient that my finetuned GPT3.5 is automatically deployed and served by OpenAI, and the same goes for Llama3 and Solar or Mistral, but I want a single place where I can see them all. Until now I hadn’t really seen this project or problem as being so much about MLOps, but when you have multiple models in play and you’re finetuning and updating them and data is changing all the time, then you’ll need a way of managing all this.</p>
<p>This is funny to me since <a href="https://zenml.io/">I work at an MLOps company</a> – we build an open-source MLOps framework that helps you set up a platform – but I hadn’t anticipated it’d reach this point where I’d need something like a ZenML so soon. This is, of course, one of the major tradeoffs of finetuning LLMs, in that you have to manage all this <em>stuff</em> in order to make it work reliably and repeatably. Even at this early stage of my project, it’s clear that you need a way to keep everything straight without making mistakes.</p>
</section>
<section id="but-evals-give-me-a-way-to-know-if-im-making-progress">
<h2 data-anchor-id="but-evals-give-me-a-way-to-know-if-im-making-progress">…but evals give me a way to know if I’m making progress</h2>
<p>Even though the evaluations were somewhat painful to implement (at least in the form of this Jupyter notebook), they have given me an amazing gift in that I now have a task-specific way to know whether any of the improvements or refinements to either the training data or to the model are helping move me forward. Without this I’d essentially be flying blind.</p>
</section>
<section id="next-steps">
<h2 data-anchor-id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>I had originally thought and suggested that I’d want to train multiple models to be super-specialists in their field, so for example to have one model that was really good at estimating how many people were captured in a particular event. Seeing the performance of my models, I’m not sure that’s the obvious next step for this project, or if I’d really be able to boost the accuracy by a significant amount by taking that approach.</p>
<p>This project is all about accuracy, so it’s possible that I might want to try that out, but for now I’m still exploring all the different phases of the LLM finetuning process so I’ll put the submodels idea on the backburner.</p>
<p>The first obvious next step is to run some evaluations for the non-accuracy-related tests mentioned <a href="https://mlops.systems/posts/2024-06-25-evaluation-finetuning-manual-dataset.html">in my last blog</a>. For example, I’d like to see how it performs with out of domain data (i.e. completely made up data about something completely different).</p>
<p>The other next step is to get into some of the details around model serving. I’d like to take my top three performers and dive into how LLM model serving is done. I’m familiar with non-LLM model serving and some of the ways people do that through my work, but LLM serving has it’s own tricks, tradeoffs and tools and I’m eager to learn more about those.</p>
<p>If this was a problem that I was deeply invested in solving beyond these already excellent results, I’d probably also want to dive into the areas where my LLMs struggled. So I’d take all the places where my LLMs failed to get the answer correct, load them up into some kind of web interface like Lilac or Argilla and really inspect my data further. Understanding the failure scenarios will probably do more for the accuracy than any tweaking of the finetuning parameters or the like.</p>
<p>For now, I’m just happy the finetuned models beat GPT-4!</p>

</p>
<p>I grew up just outside of Johannesburg, which is touted to be "the greenest city in the world". During the summer, when seen from above, it's a verdant, green landscape, with the tops of buildings popping through the canopy.</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman-1719820418.jpg" alt="Joburg trees"></p>
<p><small>Yes, there's a full city beneath those trees.</small></p>
<p>However, this is not what the land originally looked like.</p>
<p>To cut a long story short, Johannesburg was established following the discovery of gold in 1886. It's known colloquially as eGoli, or "The City of Gold". Gold extraction here is vastly different to other parts of the world. We don't have gold veins running through the rock like in old Western movies. Instead it's mineralised into the rock itself which requires significant processing to extract.</p>
<p>This form of extraction leads to the crushing of millions of tons of rock, which is then dumped creating large, dusty hills around the city. These hills are (especially to the communities surrounding them) toxic and radioactive<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, and when the wind picks up yellow dust clouds used to envelop the city.</p>
<p>One of the proposed solutions to suppressing this omnipresent dust was the planting of trees (1.2 millions as of 2024) on sidewalks and pavement, and millions more planted privately in back-yards and plots. Due to Apartheid in South Africa, which economically and socially disadvantaged the majority of the population based on race, these planting efforts were not equitably distributed. You can still see a stark difference between rich and poor neighbourhoods to this day based purely on tree cover.</p>
<p>But I'm not here to talk about the socioeconomic problems facing South Africa. Instead I'd like to focus on how the planting of so many trees affected the city itself.</p>
<p>Since these trees were originally planted to manage dust, they are generally big and leafy. This has the benefit of creating a lot of shade throughout the city, mitigating a lot of the "heat island" effect which is pervasive in any city since asphalt and concrete are great at absorbing visible spectrum light and radiating it as heat<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. Walking down a shady street on a hot summer day is such a pleasant experience when compared to being out in the blistering sun.</p>
<p>Trees are not just great dust sinks and heat shields, but great sound barriers as well<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>. Having tree lined streets not only reduces the noise of traffic (and the dust kicked up from their tyres), but also protects pedestrians and infrastructure on the sidewalks from stray vehicles.</p>
<p>On top of that it just looks better. I'm certain humans have genetic biophilia<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>, which is why we love being in nature or taking walks in the forest. Having trees around us, teeming with birds and other life just <em>feels good</em>. Speaking of birds, trees increase the biodiversity of insects and other small critters in urban environments. It also gives birds a safe-haven from the deadliest hunter of all: the humble house cat<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I've been to many cities, all over the world. Some that do trees well, and others that fail miserably. And I'm always shocked at the contrast. Given two cities with a similar climate, I'm significantly more likely to do things like walk to a local coffee shop and browse corner stores, or sit on a park bench. But only if the walk is pleasant and shady.</p>
<p>Planting trees as a form of environmentalism or carbon capture is generally a hit-or-miss strategy. The vast majority of planted trees never reach maturity<sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup>, and depending on where the trees are planted it could have a net heating instead of a net cooling effect due to the change in the environment's albedo<sup id="fnref-7"><a href="#fn-7">7</a></sup>. However, planting trees in cities is pretty much all upside with almost no downside (except that birds tend to shit on my car).</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman-1719820405.jpg" alt="Dead car"></p>
<p>So the next time you're enjoying a walk down a lovely shady street, take a look up and appreciate the trees.</p>

    <p>
        <time datetime="2024-06-19 17:00:00 +0000">19 Jun 2024</time>
        <br>
        By Sung Kim
    </p>

    <p>Programmers should be paranoid.</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I double checked the code”</li>
  <li>“The code passes the tests”</li>
  <li>“The reviewer approved my code”</li>
</ul>

<p>“So is my code correct?”</p>

<p>Writing code correctly is hard and verifying code correctness is impossible.
Here are some reasons why:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Generality</strong>: Even if your code behaves correctly once, will it do so for
all cases, for all machines, for all times?</li>
  <li><strong>False Pass</strong>: Failing tests indicate the presence of bugs, but passing
tests do not promise their absence.</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of certainty</strong>: You could write a formal proof for your code’s
correctness but now you must wonder if the proof is correct. You would need to
prove the proof. This chain of verifying the verification would
never end.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is folly to pursue certainty of your code’s correctness. A bug may be hiding
in a dependency that you’ll never find. Yet we should not despair. We can still
decrease the risk of bugs via greater understanding and due diligence.</p>

<h2 id="abstractions">Abstractions</h2>

<p>What is “greater understanding”? Let’s focus on one facet of understanding which
comes up frequently among programmers: <em>abstractions</em>.</p>

<p>Abstractions are…</p>
<ul>
  <li>mental models of how stuff works</li>
  <li>when we treat <code>thing A</code> <strong>as if</strong> it were <code>thing B</code></li>
  <li>metaphorically…
    <ul>
      <li>the result of the data compression that occurs in your brain</li>
      <li>seeing the forest for the trees</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>used all the time in day-to-day life</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The word “abstraction” has many meanings. In programming, it can also refer
to layers of code that hide complexity. This post will only be talking about
abstractions in the cognitive sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Examples of abstraction:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We treat our bank deposits <strong>as if</strong> the bank simply stores that money for us.
    <ul>
      <li>In reality, the bank does not just store the money we deposit. It loans
away/invests most of the money that people deposit. Our money does <em>not</em>
sit idle in a large pile in a vault.</li>
      <li>The abstraction works because banks still keep enough cash on hand to
handle most withdrawals.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We treat time <strong>as if</strong> it passes at the same rate for everyone.
    <ul>
      <li>Time dilation slightly changes each person/object’s flow of time based on
their speed and how much gravity they’re under.</li>
      <li>GPS satellites orbiting the Earth have to adjust their clocks by ~38
microseconds per day to account for time dilation
(<a href="https://pilotswhoaskwhy.com/2021/03/14/gnss-vs-time-dilation-what-the/">Source</a>).</li>
      <li>The abstraction works because the effect of time dilation is too miniscule
to notice unless you are doing extremely precise engineering.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>One way to form abstractions is by removing details (creating a simplified view
of something complex). For example, most people that drive do not know much about
the inner workings of their car. Their perspective of the car can be boiled down
to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ignition turns on car</li>
  <li>Accelerator makes car go</li>
  <li>Brake makes car stop</li>
  <li>Wheel turns car</li>
  <li>Car needs gas/diesel</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing the above abstraction makes it unnecessary to understand the inner
workings of car engines. Most drivers have only this working knowledge of cars
and they can drive where they need to go.</p>

<p>When we use a programming language, it provides abstractions that allow us to
operate computers without understanding their inner workings.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Basic language features</strong> (such as loops, if-conditionals, functions,
statements, and expressions) are all abstractions which hide:
    <ul>
      <li>Hardware-level details: CPU instructions, registers, flags, and details
specific to CPU architecture, …</li>
      <li>OS-level details: call stack management, memory management, …</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Portability</strong>: Languages abstract away the need to concern ourselves with the
differences between different machines.
    <ul>
      <li>Any compiled Java program (eg, a jar file) <em>should be</em> able to run on any
machine that has a Java Runtime Environment (ie, JVM) on it.</li>
      <li>A Python script <em>should be</em> able to run on any machine with a Python
interpreter.</li>
      <li>A C program <em>should be</em> able to compile and run on any machine if the machine
has a C compiler.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="abstractions-fail">Abstractions fail</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, abstractions fail.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Language abstractions are not enough if you care about code performance. To
speed up your code, you need to know hardware-level and OS-level details.</li>
  <li>Porting programs that have external dependencies such as dynamic libraries or
network requirements is not as simple. They cannot simply be moved to
another machine and run. Extra setup and knowledge are required.</li>
  <li>Car owners who only know the bare minimum can end up stuck in a broken down
car. If the driver doesn’t regularly change their car’s lubricant/oil, they’ll
shorten the engine’s lifespan.</li>
</ul>

<p>The driver’s abstraction works well in the short term (for a single drive), but
fails in the long term (many years). Joel Spolsky describes such failing
abstractions as “leaky” and put forth the <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">Law of Leaky Abstractions</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is similar to the maxim from statistics:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All models are wrong, but some are useful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we write code, we use leaky abstractions all the time. Here are some random
examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Garbage collection takes away the burden of worrying about memory management
(unless we care about latency jitters)</li>
  <li>C++ smart pointers make memory safe (as long as you don’t store any raw
pointers from it)</li>
  <li>Hashtables are fast because they have O(1) operations (but arrays are faster
for smaller sizes).</li>
  <li>Passing by reference is faster than passing by value (except for cases of copy
elision and values which fit in CPU registers like ints)</li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately, many leaky abstractions crash your code when they fail, so they’re
easy to address. However, some may just produce undefined behavior or
performance degradation which are harder to identify and fix.</p>

<h2 id="press-x-to-doubt">Press X to doubt</h2>

<p>So if abstractions can be problematic, then should we try to understand a topic
without abstractions (to know cars as they <em>really</em> are)? No. When you dig
beneath abstractions, you just find more abstractions. It’s turtles all the way
down.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Underpinning our abstraction of cars, there is an understanding of each
component’s purpose.</li>
  <li>Beneath that, the chemistry of combustion and the mechanical engineering of
the engine</li>
  <li>Beneath that, the mathematics/physics that model the forces of our universe</li>
</ul>

<p>These layers of abstractions go down until we hit our most basic axioms about
logic and reality.</p>

<p>As programmers, we should see our knowledge as a house of cards made of leaky
abstractions and assumptions. We should have a healthy amount of skepticism of
everything and everyone, including ourselves.</p>

<h2 id="trust-but-verify">Trust, but verify</h2>

<p>A programmer should have a “trust, but verify” policy.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trust the information that people tell you, but verify it with what the
documentation says</li>
  <li>Test your beliefs by trying to disprove them.
    <ul>
      <li>You wrote tests for your code change and they pass on the first try. Try
running the tests without your changes and see if they still pass. They
may have a bug that makes them always pass.</li>
      <li>You’ve refactored the code which should be a no-op. All the tests still
pass. Check to make sure there actually are any tests that run the code
you refactored.</li>
      <li>You optimized your service and you see the expected reduction in resource
utilization. Check to make sure your service is not just handling fewer
requests at the moment.</li>
      <li>You’ve submitted a code change and you see no problems in the service the
next day. Check to make sure a rollout occurred that day and your code was
included in it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Always measure impact when optimizing code. Code changes that appear to be
“theoretically” faster can end up being slower due to factors revealed in
lower layers of abstraction.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="beware-of-unknown-unknowns">Beware of unknown unknowns</h2>

<p>The scariest epistemological issue for programmers is the “unknown unknown”.</p>

<p>There are…</p>
<ul>
  <li>things you know (ie, “knowns”)</li>
  <li>things you know you don’t know (“known unknowns”)</li>
  <li>things you don’t even know that you don’t know (“unknown unknowns”)</li>
</ul>

<p>These unknown unknowns are the root of abstraction failures (and the reason why
programmers can never accurately predict how long a project will take).</p>

<p>You may have never heard of…</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sanitizing user inputs
    <ul>
      <li>If you use user-provided strings as part of a SQL query, your service can
be hacked via SQL injections.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Character encodings
    <ul>
      <li>Any text data your code processes must be using the character encoding
(eg, ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-32, etc) your code expects/supports.</li>
      <li>Random access of a character in a text buffer could take constant
time (for ASCII) or linear time (for UTF-8) depending on the character
encoding.</li>
      <li>You may output incomprehensible characters if you try to read text data
using the wrong character encoding.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Java heap size
    <ul>
      <li>Your program may be slowed down due to a lack of heap memory.</li>
      <li>You could fix this issue if you knew to configure a larger max heap size
for your Java program.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have not heard of these topics before, you may not even know that you
fell into their pitfalls.</p>

<p>There is no sure fire way to catch unknown unknowns when they are around but we
should check under at least one layer of abstraction to look for them.
Especially when a project requires learning something new, you should always
learn more than you need to. Doing so will mitigate the risk of being
surprised by abstraction failures.</p>

<p>When learning/working with an unfamiliar platform/language/tool/library/technology:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Read more documentation than just the bare minimum you need</li>
  <li>Watch videos
    <ul>
      <li>Conference presentations have the highest quality in my experience</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Read blog posts</li>
  <li>Read the source code</li>
  <li>Grow your understanding of abstractions you have to work with
    <ul>
      <li>Learn about features recently added in to your programming language</li>
      <li>Read through all of the public functions of libraries, not just the ones
you’re using</li>
      <li>Skim through all of the flags of a CLI tool’s man page</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Learn at least one layer of abstraction lower than you need
    <ul>
      <li>Learn about your compiler’s optimizations</li>
      <li>If you’re running a service, learn about your orchestration platform (ex:
kubernetes)</li>
      <li>If you’re working in Java, learn about the JVM</li>
      <li>If you’re working in Python, learn about the Python interpreter.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Abstractions are necessary as they allow us to think efficiently but they are
treacherous as they can make it appear that we know “enough”. Programmers who
learn superficially will not succeed on difficult projects that come without
known solutions and involve multiple domains of expertise.</p>

<p>That said, the ideal put forth by this blog post needs to be balanced against
reality. Obviously, we can’t take time to learn every little thing when we’re
in a rush. Also, beginners can’t be expected to be so thorough. Ideals should be
balanced against real-world considerations.</p>

<p>And real-world considerations should be balanced against ideals. We should be
willing to pay some short-term costs for thorough learning and verifications.
Not just for writing correct code, but as part of our long-term journey of
becoming capable and principled engineers.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p><em>“Why do you want to work for us?”</em></p><p>I have run into this question many times as I’ve been applying to and interviewing with lots of companies.</p><p>99% of the reason people want to work for a company is <strong>because they need money</strong>. That’s it. They want to be able to pay off debt. They want to be able to pay their bills. They want to be able to pay rent or their mortgage. They want to be able provide for their family. They want to be able to afford a better life. And so on.</p><p>Sure, the tech stack might be exciting. Or the product may be compelling. The work-life balance may be good. But I promise you that the biggest reason is still money.</p><p>If you don’t believe me, find your most passionate engineers, cut their compensation in half, and see if they stick around. I guarantee you they won’t.</p><p>Let’s stop beating around the bush and be real with each other. Do you really want to to be lied to by every candidate?</p><p>It’s okay to be motivated by money. That’s the world we live in. An engineer can do amazing work for your company even if they are only motivated by money. Also, companies are only motivated by making money. What’s wrong with the average person being motivated by the same thing?</p><p>You may have come across my application to your company at some point. I may have said something about wanting to work with bright people and looking for growth opportunities. While that is still true, you should know that 99% of the reason I applied to your company is to earn money so I can buy food, pay rent, and provide for my family.</p><p>Let’s stop asking this question in the application and interview process. We all know the real answer.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>
