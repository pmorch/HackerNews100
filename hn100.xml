            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>David Bessis was drawn to mathematics for the same reason that many people are driven away: He didn’t understand how it worked. Unlike other creative processes, like making music, which can be heard, or painting pictures, which can be seen, math is for the most part an internal process, hidden from view. “It sounded a bit magical. I was intrigued,” he said.</p>
<p>His curiosity eventually led him to pursue a doctoral degree in math at Paris Diderot University in the late 1990s. He spent the next decade studying geometric group theory before leaving research mathematics and founding a machine learning startup in 2010.</p>
<p>Through it all, he never stopped questioning what it actually means to do math. Bessis wasn’t content to simply solve problems. He wanted to further interrogate — and help other people understand — how mathematicians think about and practice their craft.</p>

<p>In 2022, he published his answer — a book titled <em>Mathematica: A Secret World of Intuition and Curiosity</em>, which he hopes will “explain what’s going on inside the brain of someone who’s doing math,” he said. But more than that, he added, “this is a book about the inner experience of humans.” It was translated from the original French into English earlier this year.</p>
<p>In <em>Mathematica</em>, Bessis makes the provocative claim that whether you realize it or not, you’re constantly doing math — and that you’re capable of expanding your mathematical abilities far beyond what you think possible. Eminent mathematicians like Bill Thurston and Alexander Grothendieck didn’t owe their mathematical prowess to intrinsic genius, Bessis argues. Rather, they became such powerful mathematicians because they were willing to constantly question and refine their intuitions. They developed new ideas and then used logic and language to test and improve them.</p>
<p>According to Bessis, however, the way math is taught in school emphasizes the logic-based part of this process, when the more important element is intuition. Math should be thought of as a dialogue between the two: between reason and instinct, between language and abstraction. It’s also a physical practice of sorts, like yoga or martial arts — something that can be improved through training. It requires tapping into a childlike state and embracing one’s imagination, including the mistakes that come with it.</p>

    <p>Everyone, Bessis says, has some experience with this process, meaning that everyone has practice thinking like a mathematician. Moreover, everyone can, and should, try to improve their mathematical thinking — not necessarily to solve math problems, but as a general self-help technique.</p>
<p><em>Quanta </em>spoke with Bessis about what mathematicians are really doing when they’re “doing math,” and what it means for math to be a form of self-help. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</p>
<h3><strong>Why did you write this book?</strong></h3>
<p>For maybe 20 years, I tried and failed to write it many, many times. Then in 2020, I reread texts that I had read a long time ago — accounts by the mathematicians René Descartes, Alexander Grothendieck and William Thurston. I realized that these three people, who were not connected to one another, were all telling the same story in different ways. That story resonated with what I had been living. After that realization, the book completely crystallized in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>What we can learn from Descartes, Grothendieck and Thurston is that the nature of the mathematical process is not what people think.</p>

                            <p>At its core, Bessis says, mathematics is a game of back-and-forth between intuition and logic, instinct and reason.</p>

    <h3><strong>What do people think?</strong></h3>
<p>That math is a bunch of cryptic symbols on a piece of paper. This is what has been advertised as mathematics for millennia, because that’s what people see. But the whole journey — how you work with things in your mind, how math transforms you — is all secret. It’s not part of the curriculum.</p>
<p>Math is a sort of dialogue between these external and internal processes. It is the activity of aligning your inner representation — your intuition — with some logical, external representation. You use a very rigid, crazy-looking formalism to test your intuition, to recalibrate, grow and reinforce it until you feel that you have a good understanding of something.</p>
<h3><strong>You claim that everyone is secretly doing math, even if they don’t realize it.</strong></h3>
<p>You have to force them to become aware of their own mathematical training. Can you see a circle in your mind? Can you make it bigger, smaller? Can you move it around? That’s weird, you know.</p>

    <p>Or say I ask, “What’s a billion minus one?” I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t immediately have the answer in their head. I have to think about it when I want to say it out loud, but I see it in my mind. And I think most people are like that. Even if they don’t see it — it’s not a visual perception — they have a strong feeling of the outcome.</p>
<p>This is really mathematical intuition. It’s obvious to people. But it’s also historical: 2,000 years ago, nobody would have been able to easily answer this question, because they were using Roman numerals.</p>
<p>It proves that what you view as very easy math is actually deep math that you’ve internalized. You learned a very abstract numbering system that transformed your intuition of numbers. It makes you find things completely obvious that 2,000 years ago would have made you look like Einstein. It’s not hardwired. You wired it yourself.</p>
<h3><strong>Do you believe in the notion of a mathematical genius, then?</strong></h3>
<p>It would be dishonest to deny that there are people who are incredibly good at math. There are 5-year-olds who are already genius mathematicians. You can see it: It looks like they’re communicating with aliens from outer space.</p>
<p>But I do not think this is innate, even though it often manifests in early childhood. Genius is not an essence. It’s a state. It’s a state that you build by doing a certain job.</p>
<p>Math is a journey. It’s about plasticity. I am not saying that math is easy. Math is hard. But life, whatever you do, is extremely hard.</p>

    <h3><strong>If it’s not innate, but rather a process, does that mean that with practice I could eventually do math like Thurston?</strong></h3>
<p>No, not Thurston. I don’t think so. But maybe you’ll surprise me. Thurston gave a detailed account of how he decided at a young age to practice this kind of self-education every day. I don’t think you can catch up with that. Grothendieck and Descartes probably started very young, before they were even speaking.</p>
<p>The point I want to make is that high school students are often unhappy with math, because they think it requires some innate things that they don’t have. But that’s not true; really it relies on the same type of intuition we use every day.</p>
<h3><strong>So how can one get better at math?</strong></h3>
<p>Whenever you spot a disconnect between what your gut is telling you and what is supposed to be rational, it’s an important opportunity to understand something new. And then you can start this game of back-and-forth. Can you articulate your gut instinct and place it within a rational discussion? If there’s still a disconnect, can you visualize why? As you play that game, your imagination will gradually reconfigure. And in the end, if you’re persistent, your instinct and your reason will align, and you will be smarter. This is mathematical thinking.</p>
<h3><strong>What can someone gain by improving their mathematical thinking?</strong></h3>
<p>Joy, clarity and self-confidence.</p>
<p>Children do this all the time. That’s why they learn so fast. They have to. Otherwise, I mean, nothing makes sense. I think this is also why babies are super happy — because they have epiphanies all day long. It’s wonderful.</p>

    <p>For adults, this way of thinking can be very slow. But if you don’t give up, what you can do with your intuition is way beyond your wildest expectations. And this is universal. My book is a life lesson for all creative people, not just those who want to learn mathematical concepts. The mathematician’s message is for everyone: Look at what you can do if you don’t give up on your intuition.</p>
<h3><strong>Do you view this as a self-help book?</strong></h3>
<p>I’m actually more extreme than just saying this is a self-help book. I’m saying that, in a way, mathematics itself is a self-help technique.</p>
<h3><strong>How so?</strong></h3>
<p>Mathematicians have to be radically honest about what they don’t understand and what they think. That might help them see, for example, that an object is defined the wrong way. Or that a different definition will make a theory simpler. Or that this is not the important notion, that one is.</p>
        
        
<p>There’s something about honesty, about being radically candid, about trying to find ways to articulate what you really feel — it’s super hard. It takes practice.</p>
<p>When you do math, you’re exposed to the human thought process in a way that is really pure. It’s not just about understanding things, but about understanding things in a very childish, deep, naïve, super clear, obvious way. It’s very good training for creativity. It’s a scaffold for your imagination.</p>
<p>When I look at my own life, and the way I managed to overcome personal challenges, I realize that my ability to think in a mathematical way helped. From an emotional standpoint, we all need math.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                <p>Trendy weight-loss drugs making headlines for shrinking waistlines may also be shrinking the human heart and other muscles, according to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452302X24002869">new University of Alberta study</a> whose authors say should serve as a “cautionary tale” about possible long-term health effects of these drugs.</p>
<p>“If people have been prescribed these drugs, then the benefits should likely far exceed the risks,” says <a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/jrbdyck">Jason Dyck</a>, lead author on the study, pediatrics professor in the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/medicine/index.html">Faculty of Medicine &amp; Dentistry</a> and a member of the <a href="https://www.wchri.org/">Women and Children’s Health Research Institute</a>.</p>
<p>“However, the growing number of people who may be taking these drugs who do not meet the eligibility criteria and who are not at risk have a different risk-reward calculation that they should be made aware of.”</p>
<p>Dyck and his team set out to study why a reported side-effect of the leading weight-loss drug Ozempic is the loss of skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>Ozempic, known medically as semaglutide, was originally designed to help adult patients with type 2 diabetes control their blood sugar. However, this drug — and a host of others in this class of medication — are also being touted for their effectiveness as an anti-obesity medication.</p>
<p>Using mice for the study, the researchers found that heart muscle also decreased in both obese and lean mice. The systemic effect observed in mice was then confirmed in cultured human heart cells.</p>
<p>Dyck, who is the <a href="https://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.aspx">Canada Research Chair</a> in Molecular Medicine and heads up the <a href="http://www.cvrc.med.ualberta.ca/Home/index.html">Cardiovascular Research Centre</a>, says his team did not observe any detrimental functional effects in hearts of mice with smaller hearts and thus would not expect any overt health effects in humans. But he adds that there may be more impact over the long term, or some forms of cardiac stress may have a detrimental effect that wasn’t observed at rest.</p>
<p>“Given the growing number of people taking this drug who have no cardiovascular disease or who are not classified as obese, we suggest that cardiac structure and function be carefully evaluated in previous and ongoing clinical studies.”</p>
<p>Dyck’s study comes on the heels of a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00272-9/abstract">commentary published in the November issue of <em>The Lancet</em></a> by an international team of researchers from the U of A, McMaster and Louisiana State University who examined emerging research showing that up to 40 per cent of the weight lost by people using weight-loss drugs is actually muscle.</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/cprado">Carla Prado</a>, a nutrition researcher in the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/agriculture-life-environment-sciences/index.html">Faculty of Agricultural, Life &amp; Environmental Sciences</a> and lead author on the commentary, explains this rate of muscle decline is significantly higher than what is typically observed with calorie-reduced diets or normal aging and could lead to a host of long-term health issues — including decreased immunity, increased risk of infections and poor wound healing.</p>
<p>“Muscle does much more than just help us move or lift things. It is a powerful organ that keeps us healthy in a number of ways,” she says.</p>
<p>For example, muscle stores important building blocks — amino acids — that the body uses when we’re sick, stressed or injured to repair itself and stay strong. It also plays a huge role in managing blood sugar, which helps prevent diabetes.</p>
<p>As well, Prado notes muscle releases special molecules called myokines that signal other parts of the body to help fight infections and support our immune system.</p>
<p>“That’s why preserving muscle is so important, especially during weight-loss treatments — it’s not just about staying strong, but about keeping our whole body resilient and healthy.”</p>
<p>In the commentary, the authors suggest that muscle loss due to weight reduction may also exacerbate conditions like sarcopenic obesity — characterized by a combination of high body fat and low skeletal muscle mass — which contributes to poorer health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease and higher mortality rates.</p>
<p>Though the short-term effects of muscle loss on physical strength and function remain unclear, the commentary calls for future research to explore how reductions in muscle mass might improve muscle mass and composition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To keep muscle strong while losing weight, Prado says it is essential to focus on two main things: nutrition and exercise. Proper nutrition means getting enough high-quality protein, essential vitamins and minerals, and other “muscle-building” nutrients. Sometimes, this can include protein supplements to make sure the body has what it needs.</p>
<p>“Exercise is just as important — specifically resistance training like lifting weights or using resistance bands,” said Prado, who was recently named Canada Research Chair in Integrative Nutrition, Body Composition and Energy Metabolism.</p>
<p>“This type of exercise helps keep muscle from breaking down during weight loss and maintains strength.”</p>
<p>She adds that for anyone using weight loss medications, it’s best to follow a balanced program that includes both enough protein and resistance training.</p>
<p>“This can help people lose fat while minimizing muscle loss, which helps them get the full health benefits of treatment and stay strong.”</p>
<p>Prado, who is a member of the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/cancer-institute/index.html">Cancer Research Institute of Northern Alberta</a>, the <a href="https://www.wchri.org/">Women and Children’s Health Research Institute</a>, the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/alberta-diabetes/index.html">Alberta Diabetes Institute</a>, the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/alberta-transplant-institute/index.html">Alberta Transplant Institute</a> and the <a href="https://smartinstitute.ca/">Institute of Sensory Motor Rehabilitative Technology</a>, is collaborating with Dyck to explore the mechanisms and impact of various forms of muscle wasting in relation to this class of medication.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/zlibr.jpg" alt="zlibrary" width="300" height="147" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/zlibr.jpg 700w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/zlibr-18x9.jpg 18w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Library">Z-Library</a> is one of the largest shadow libraries on the Internet, hosting millions of books and academic articles that can be downloaded for free. </p>
<p>The site defied all odds over the past two years. It continued to operate despite a full-fledged criminal prosecution by the United States, which resulted in the <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-indicts-two-russians-for-running-the-z-library-piracy-ring221117/">arrest of two alleged operators</a> in Argentina. </p>
<p>These two Russian defendants are <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/alleged-z-library-operators-ask-court-to-dismiss-criminal-piracy-indictment-230713/">wanted by the United States</a> and earlier this year a judge approved their extradition. However, according to the most recent information we have, the defendants escaped house arrest and <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/z-library-admins-escape-house-arrest-after-judge-approves-u-s-extradition-240708/">vanished into thin air</a>.</p>
<p>The roles of the two Russians remain unclear, but they were not vital to the site’s survival. Z-Library continued to expand its reach despite their legal troubles. </p>
<h2>Z-Library Motivations Research</h2>
<p>Z-Library users don’t seem to be hindered by the criminal prosecution either, as they continue to support and use the site. For many, Z-Library is simply a convenient portal to download free books. For others, however, it’s a vital resource to further an academic career. </p>
<p>A recent study published in the Journal of University Teaching &amp; Learning Practice sheds light on the latter. It looks at the ‘piracy’ motivations of Redditors and students in higher education, specifically when it comes to Z-Library. </p>
<center><em>The paper</em></center><br><center><picture loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<source type="image/webp" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/zlibpaper.jpg.webp 1082w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/zlibpaper-300x129.jpg.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">

<p>The paper, published by Dr. Michael Day of the University of Greenwich, labels the use of Z-Library as ‘Academic Cybercrime’. The findings, however, suggest that students are more likely to draw comparisons with “Robin Hood”.</p>
<p>The research looks at the motivations of two groups; Reddit users and Chinese postgraduate students. Despite the vast differences between these groups, their views on Z-Library are quite similar. </p>
<h2>Redditors’ Responses</h2>
<p>The 134 Reddit responses were sampled from the Zlibrary subreddit, which is obviously biased in favor of the site. However, the reasoning goes well beyond a simple “I want free stuff” arguments.</p>
<p>Many commenters highlighted that they were drawn to the site out of poverty, for example, or they highlighted that Z-Library was an essential tool to fulfill their academic goals. </p>
<p>“Living in a 3rd world country, 1 book would cost like 50%- 80% already of my daily wage,” one Redditor wrote. </p>
<p>The idea that Z-Library is a ‘necessary evil’ was also highlighted by other commenters. This includes a student who can barely make ends meet, and a homeless person, who has neither the money nor the space for physical books.</p>
<center><em>Some responses</em></center><br><center></center><center><picture loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<source type="image/webp" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/reddit-comments-1.jpg.webp 970w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/reddit-comments-1-300x198.jpg.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">

</center>
<p>The lack of free access to all study materials, including academic journal subscriptions at university libraries, was also a key motivator. Paired with the notion that journal publishers make billions of dollars, without compensating authors, justification is found for ‘pirate’ alternatives. </p>
<p>“They make massive profits. So stealing from them doesn’t hurt the authors nor reviewers, just the rich greedy publishers who make millions just to design a cover and click ‘publish’,” one Redditor wrote. </p>
<h2>Chinese Students</h2>
<p>The second part of the study is conducted in a more structured format among 103 postgraduate students in China. This group joined a seminar where Z-Library and the crackdown were discussed. In addition, the students participated in follow-up focus group discussions, while also completing a survey. </p>
<p>Despite not all being users of the shadow library, 41% of the students agreed that the site’s (temporary) shutdown affected their ability to study and find resources for degree learning.</p>
<p>In general, the students have a favorable view toward Z-Library and similar sites, and 71% admit that they have used a shadow library in the past. In line with China’s socialist values, the overwhelming majority of the students agreed that access to knowledge should be free for everyone. </p>
<p>While the students are aware of copyright law, they believe that the need to access knowledge outweighs rightsholders’ concerns. This is also reflected in the following responses, among others. </p>
<blockquote><p><sup>– Z-Library, or a similar website, is helpful to students living in poverty (82% agree).<br>
– Academic textbooks are too expensive, so I can’t afford to buy them as a student (67% agree).<br>
– I have limited access to English medium academic books in my country (63% agree)<br>
– I prefer to download books without restrictions, like [paywalls etc.], as it is difficult (77% agree).</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>All in all, Z-Library and other shadow libraries are seen as a viable option for expensive or inaccessible books, despite potential copyright concerns. </p>
<h2>Robin Hood Mentality</h2>
<p>This research sheds an intriguing light on key motivations to use shadow libraries. However, the small sample sizes, selection bias, and specific characteristics of the groups, means that these findings should be interpreted with caution. </p>
<p>Dr. Michael Day, nonetheless, notes that the responses show clear signs of a Robin Hood mentality. Z-Library users evade the publishers’ ‘tax’ on knowledge by downloading works for free. </p>
<p>Overall, the paper suggests that universities and publishers may want to reconsider the status quo and consider making more content freely accessible, taking a page from Z-Library. </p>
<p>“There is need for universities to re-consider the digital divides faced by socioeconomically and digitally disadvantaged students, alongside publishers, who must rethink their approach by making open access research more commonplace and thus pro-human,” the author concludes.  </p>
<p>The paper provides a good example, as it is published under a Creative Commons license and is <a href="https://doi.org/10.53761/90p10x2">freely accessible to all</a>. </p>

This is especially true when there is insufficient resilience or alternative paths — that is, when a cable is effectively a single point of failure. Associated observations of traffic loss resulting from these disruptions are frequently covered by Cloudflare Radar in social media and blog posts. However, two recent cable cuts that occurred in the Baltic Sea resulted in little-to-no observable impact to the affected countries, as we discuss below, in large part because of the significant redundancy and resilience of Internet infrastructure in Europe.</p>

          </p>
        <p>Internet quality metrics for both countries show changes in measured bandwidth and latency throughout the day on Sunday, but with no sudden anomalous shifts visible around the time of the cable cut. (The loss of connectivity associated with a cable cut potentially manifests itself as an increase in latency and concurrent decrease in bandwidth due to loss of capacity.) The latency graph for Sweden does show an increase in latency, but it began before the cable cut occurred, is similar to a pattern visible several hours earlier, and is matched by an increase in measured bandwidth, so it is unlikely to be related to the cable cut event.</p>

Cinia, the telecommunications company that owns the cable, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/baltic-sea-cables-damage-sabotage-german-minister"><u>said</u></a> that the cable stopped working at about 02:00 UTC.&nbsp;</p><p>In this situation as well, as the Cloudflare Radar graphs below show, there was no apparent impact to traffic volumes in either country at the time that the cables were damaged. The Finland graphs, week-on-week, show fewer bytes transferred and fewer HTTP requests, but that difference is present before the cable cut at 02:00 UTC. However, the trend of the current line does not change after the cable cut, so the two events would appear unrelated.&nbsp;</p>

          </p>
        <p>By looking at volume-related metrics, alone, Internet connectivity would appear to be unaffected by the cable cut.</p><p>If, however, we change perspective and look at Internet quality, a brief yet interesting change is visible for Finland around the reported time of the cable damage, though it isn’t clear whether it is related in any way. Just after midnight, median measured bandwidth, previously consistent around 50 Mbps begins to grow, peaking just over 200 Mbps around 03:00 UTC. Around that same time, measured median latency also begins to drop, falling from around 30 ms to a low of 13 ms, also around 03:00 UTC. Median bandwidth returned to normal levels around 06:00 UTC, while latency took about two hours longer to return to normal levels.&nbsp; These observed&nbsp; improvements in bandwidth and latency could have been due to traffic being re-routed to along paths with better connectivity to measurement endpoints, but because the shifts began before the cable damage occurred, and recovered shortly thereafter, that is unlikely to be the root cause.</p><p>In Germany, a brief minor increase in median bandwidth peaked around 02:45 UTC, while no notable changes were observed in latency.</p>

            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            
          </p>
          <p>As we have discussed in multiple prior blog posts (<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/not-one-not-two-but-three-undersea-cables-cut-in-jersey"><u>Jersey, 2016</u></a>; <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/aae-1-smw5-cable-cuts"><u>AAE-1/SMW5, 2022</u></a>; <a href="https://blog-cloudflare-com.webpkgcache.com/doc/-/s/blog.cloudflare.com/undersea-cable-failures-cause-internet-disruptions-across-africa-march-14-2024"><u>WACS/MainOne/SAT3/ACE, 2024</u></a>; <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/east-african-internet-connectivity-again-impacted-by-submarine-cable-cuts/"><u>EASSy/Seacom, 2024</u></a>), cable cuts often cause significant disruptions to Internet connectivity, in many cases because they represent a concentrated point of vulnerability, whether for an individual network provider, city/state, or country. These disruptions are often quite lengthy as well, due to the time needed to marshal repair resources, identify the location of the damage, etc. Although it is not always feasible due to financial or geographic constraints, building redundant and resilient network architecture, at multiple levels, is a best practice. This includes the sending traffic over multiple physical cables (both submarine and terrestrial), connecting to multiple peer and upstream network providers, and even avoiding single points of failure in core Internet resources like DNS servers.</p><p>The Cloudflare Radar team continually monitors the status of Internet connectivity in countries/regions around the world, and we share our observations on the <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center"><u>Cloudflare Radar Outage Center</u></a>, via social media, and in posts on <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/cloudflare-radar/"><u>blog.cloudflare.com</u></a>.

<p>Under the strength of Forbes' long-existing and well-linked site, Forbes Marketplace/Advisor has dominated the search term "best cbd gummies" for "an eternity," <a href="https://x.com/lilyraynyc/status/1859262396130336911">according to SEO analyst Lily Ray</a>. Forbes has similarly dominated "best pet insurance," and long came up as the second result for "how to get rid of roaches," as <a href="https://larslofgren.com/forbes-marketplace/">detailed in a blog post by Lars Lofgren</a>. If people click on this high-ranking result, and then click on a link to buy a product or request a roach removal consultation, Forbes typically gets a cut.</p>
<p>Forbes Marketplace had seemingly also provided SEO-minded review services to CNN and USA Today, as <a href="https://larslofgren.com/cnn-usa-today-forbes-marketplace/">detailed by Lofgren</a>. Lofgren's term for this business, "Parasite SEO," took hold in corners critical of the trend. Ars has contacted Forbes for comment and will update this post with response.</p>
<h2>“The unfair, exploitative nature” of “parasite SEO”</h2>
<p>Google writes that it had reviewed "situations where there might be varying degrees of first-party involvement" (most publishers' review sites indicate some kind of oversight or editorial standards linked to the primary site). But however arranged, "no amount of first-party involvement alters the fundamental third-party nature of the content or the unfair, exploitative nature of attempting to take advantage of the host sites' ranking signals."</p>
<p>As such, using third-party content in such a way as to take advantage of a high search quality ranking, outside the site's primary focus, is considered spam. That delivers a major hit to a site's Google ranking, and the impact is already being felt.</p>
<p>The SEO reordering does not affect more established kinds of third-party content, like wire service reports, syndication, or well-marked sponsored content, as detailed in Google's spam policy <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#site-reputation">section about site reputation abuse</a>. As seen on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO">SEO subreddit</a>, and on social media, Google has given sites running afoul of its updated policy a "<a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9044175?hl=en-NA">Manual Action</a>" rather than relying only on its algorithm to catch the often opaque arrangements.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Yesterday, Prusa Research officially unveiled their next printer, the Core ONE. Going over the features and capabilities of this new machine, it’s clear that Prusa has kept a close eye on the rapidly changing desktop 3D printer market and designed a machine to better position themselves within a field of increasingly capable machines from other manufacturers.</p>
<p>While some saw the incremental upgrades of the i3 MK4 as being too conservative, the Core ONE ticks all the boxes of what today’s consumer is looking for — namely high-speed CoreXY movement with a fully enclosed chamber — while still offering the build quality, upgradability, and support that the company has built its reputation on. Put simply it’s one of the most exciting products they’ve introduced in a long time, and exactly the kind of machine that many Prusa fans have been waiting for.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s one feature that’s ominously absent from the <a href="https://blog.prusa3d.com/introducing-prusa-core-one-fully-enclosed-corexy-3d-printer-with-active-temperature-control_105477/" target="_blank">Core ONE announcement post</a>. It’s easy to overlook, and indeed, most consumers probably won’t even know it’s missing. But for those of us who are concerned with such matters, it’s an unspoken confirmation that an era has finally come to an end.</p>
<p>With the Core ONE, Prusa Research is no longer in the business of making open source 3D printer hardware, but that doesn’t mean that the printer isn’t hackable. It’s complicated, so read on.</p>

<h2>Death by a Thousand Cuts</h2>
<p>To say that Prusa Research pivoting away from the open source hardware (OSHW) principles that guided the company, and indeed the 3D printing community, through its early years is a disappointment would be quite an understatement. It’s a crushing blow. One which critics will use to call into question the viability of building a sustainable business model around OSHW. But it’s also not hard to see how we got to this point.</p>

<p>The first warning sign came back in 2021, <a href="https://blog.prusa3d.com/original-prusa-xl-first-look_58312/" target="_blank">with the announcement of the Prusa XL</a>. With this new high-end printer, the company seemed uncharacteristically hesitant to open things up, which frankly wasn’t entirely unreasonable. The pricing of the XL put it closer into the professional market than a traditional hobbyist machine, and there were some new features like tool changing and a&nbsp; segmented heated bed that were unique enough that they’d want to keep the details under wraps until the machine at least got a foothold in the market. So if Prusa wanted to play this one a little closer to the chest, so be it.</p>
<p>But things took a concerning turn last year with the <a href="https://blog.prusa3d.com/announcing-original-prusa-mk4_76585/" target="_blank">release of the i3 MK4</a>. Although Prusa still called the printer open source in their marketing, the reality was a bit more complicated. While at least some of the printer’s technical information was made available, especially the elements that were inherited from the earlier i3 models, there were several rather large omissions.</p>
<p>Printable parts were available only as STLs, there were no design files released for the printer’s control board, and the Nextruder (which was introduced with the XL) remained all but completely proprietary. Many argued that the MK4 didn’t meet the standards that Prusa had set with their previous printers, and that continuing to call it open source was misleading.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t already obvious that Prusa’s commitment to open source was beginning to waiver, <a href="https://blog.prusa3d.com/the-state-of-open-source-in-3d-printing-in-2023_76659/" target="_blank">Josef’s post on the Prusa Blog</a> made his position abundantly clear. Framed as a call for discussion, the post outlined his feelings on the open source community and what he perceived as the failures of common licenses such as the GPL. While he said that the company still intended to make their machines open, the writing was clearly on the wall.</p>
<h2>A New Chapter for Prusa</h2>
<p>To be clear, the Core ONE is of critical strategic importance to Prusa. The company needed a revamped machine to combat increased competition from Chinese printer manufacturers, and while it’s not being marketed as a replacement for the i3 MK4, it’s not hard to see the direction the market is moving in. The i3 is a workhorse, and won’t be going away anytime soon, but the chances that it will see a MK5 at this point seem exceptionally slim.</p>

<p>But the Core ONE also represents a mostly clean slate design, one that shares relatively little with the i3. This frees Prusa from any obligation, perceived or otherwise, to continue releasing the printer’s design files. Indeed, the term “open source” only appears once in the announcement post for the printer — and that’s when referring to the firmware and slicer code, which are.</p>
<p>Although we don’t have documentation or an assembly guide for the Core ONE or the MK4S-&gt;Core upgrade kits yet, it looks as if very little of Prusa’s remaining open source hardware has been brought forward.</p>
<p>Potentially the Core ONE is using some variation of the <a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/Heatbed_MK52_magnetic" target="_blank">CC BY-SA 4.0 licensed MK52 magnetic heated bed</a>, but beyond that, we already know that Prusa is still keeping the design files for major components such as the Nextruder and xBuddy 32-bit control board under wraps for the time being.</p>
<h2>Not Open, But Hackable</h2>
<p>So we know that Prusa isn’t advertising the Core ONE design as open source hardware, and that only limited technical data has been released for the few components and subsystems that it inherits from the XL and MK4S. But what does that actually mean for users like us?</p>
<p>That’s where things get a little tricky. While Prusa’s newer printers certainly do not meet the literal requirements of OSHW, they’re still remarkably transparent in a world of proprietary black boxes. We might not get the design files for the printed parts in these new machines, but you’ll get STLs that you can run off if you need a replacement. We can also be fairly sure that Prusa will continue their tradition of releasing wiring schematics for the Core ONE as they’ve done with <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/page/open-source-at-prusa-research_236812/" target="_blank">essentially all of their previous printers</a>, which is more than we can say for the vast majority of consumer products.</p>
<p>While the lack of design files for these new Prusa printers is unfortunate on a philosophical level, it’s hard to argue that they’re any less repairable, upgradable, or hackable than their predecessors. In fact, Prusa’s actually made at least one improvement in that department — announcing that <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/12/16/prusa-dares-you-to-break-their-latest-printer/">breaking off the control board’s “Appendix” security device</a> and installing a new firmware will no longer void the printer’s warranty.</p>

<p>We should also consider that even Prusa’s earlier printers have not always been as open as the company would perhaps like us to believe. Sure, for the Prusa Mini you could hop on <a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/Buddy-board-MINI-PCB" target="_blank">GitHub and grab the KiCad files for its mainboard</a>, and the design files for the i3 up until the MK3 are available as <a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/Original-Prusa-i3" target="_blank">GPLv2 licensed OpenSCAD code.</a> But the company has never actually provided a complete Bill of Materials for their printers, and <a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware-Buddy/issues/1440" target="_blank">even after years of requests from the community</a>, they have still yet to release the source code for their bootloader as they consider it a separate project from the main GPL-licensed firmware.</p>
<p>Prusa has always used a somewhat piecemeal method of releasing the source and design files for their products. But it’s worked for them up to this point. The bottom line is, makers and hackers will still have plenty to work with, even if things aren’t quite as open as we’d prefer.</p>
<h2>Becoming Your Own Enemy</h2>
<p>On a personal note, I find myself conflicted. I’d argue that the <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/10/22/a-close-look-at-the-prusa-i3-mk3/">i3 MK3 is one of the best purchases I’ve ever made</a>, and there’s no doubt in my mind that the “Prusa Experience” — support, reliability, upgradability — is worth spending the extra money on. I’m also confident that the Core ONE is precisely the kind of machine Prusa needed to remain competitive in today’s market.</p>
<figure id="attachment_734930" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-734930"><a href="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/coreone_bambu.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="734930" data-permalink="https://hackaday.com/2024/11/20/with-core-one-prusas-open-source-hardware-dream-quietly-dies/coreone_bambu/" data-orig-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/coreone_bambu.jpg" data-orig-size="532,1010" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="coreone_bambu" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="<p>Who’s copying who?</p>

<p>At the same time, there were issues that I was willing to overlook because the company was producing open source hardware. When a shipping date slipped, or a firmware update introduced a new issue, I let it slide because it was for the greater good. But now that they’re no longer calling their printers open source, I can’t help but feel some of that goodwill evaporating — and I’m probably not the only one having similar thoughts.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the part that bothers me the most about this change in Prusa’s approach is that it all seems predicated on a bogeyman that I’m not convinced actually exists. The company line is that releasing the source for their printers allows competitors to churn out cheap clones of their hardware — but where are they?</p>
<p>Let’s be honest, Bambu didn’t need to copy any of Prusa’s hardware to take their lunch money. You can only protect your edge in the market if you’re ahead of the game to begin with, and if anything, Prusa is currently playing catch-up to the rest of the industry that has moved on to faster designs. The only thing Prusa produces that their competitors are actually able to take advantage of is their slicer, but that’s another story entirely. (And of course, <a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer" target="_blank">it <em>is</em> still open source,</a> and widely forked.)</p>
<p>So will the Prusa Core ONE be a good printer? Almost certainly. Will I buy one? Very likely. But part of me will always be disappointed that the guy with the open source hardware logo tattoo took his ball and went home as soon as the game starting getting tough.</p>

                  <p>Just tried it - very cool indeed. I did a page loop extraction but it seems to be the same speed when I run it. 
The elements I am doing the loop on look pretty much the same, just different images. I think it would be great if it was able to generalize how to find an element like with css selectors for example to speed up once its sure that is the data you are looking to extract for a given loop.</p>

                  <p>Totally agree, making page loop faster is on the top of our list of things to do! There are cases where you need page loop to do quite a bit of reasoning so it will be this slow until models get faster, but we can make it a lot faster today on happy paths - stay tuned :)</p>

                  <p>If we are being honest, most of these browser screen scraping startups will be commoditized the moment OpenAI/Anthropic releases their next model. From my experience, having an in-house smaller model working in tandem with the bigger LLMs don't always necessarily produce a better result because in-context learning is just too powerful. The moment OpenAI releases a new model with a better prior, you will see a lot of these companies quietly swapping out their in-house "edge"/specialized fine tuned models. It's like those PDF data extraction companies that have been launching like crazy, 90% will be pivoting if they don't get enough B2B customers locked in. LLMs unfortunately is winner-take-all with the actual model providers cutting out all the middleman.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Database queries are a pretty surprisingly powerful tool that can solve seemingly intractable problems.</p>

<p>It is a fun coding challenge to do things in SQL. I’ve seen people solve sudokus or do <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/advent-2021-sql">advent of code</a>, or you can build a datalog on SQL with a little metaprogramming (maybe even fully internally). It is also possible to build a <a href="https://github.com/awto/chr2sql">CHR (constraint handling rules) system on SQL</a> or a graph rewriting system on SQL. Here I talk about how one can use SQL queries to do graph instruction matching <a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/imatch-datalog/">https://www.philipzucker.com/imatch-datalog/</a> .</p>

<p>SQL is a feature rich language, it is not surprising that you can do these things from that perspective, using this and that odd feature. But even the simple idealized “SELECT FROM WHERE” core of SQL has a lot of power.</p>

<p>From a logical perspective, this core is basically conjunctive queries <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_query#Relationship_to_other_query_languages">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_query#Relationship_to_other_query_languages</a> . Each table is a logical predicate, each variable is bound to a row of a column. The SELECT fields are bits that aren’t being existentially bound and therefore hidden, aka free variables.</p>

<p>$\exists y. edge(x,y) \land path(y,z)$ is the predicate form of the query <code>SELECT edge.a, path.b from edge, path WHERE edge.b = path.a</code>. There is a little bit of rearrangement from the entry centric view of predicates to the row centric view of SQL. I am not aware of a way to easily give a name to a particular entry in sql. I used this correspondence to describe how to either build a datalog engine on sql, or hand compile your datalog rules to sql <a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/tiny-sqlite-datalog/">https://www.philipzucker.com/tiny-sqlite-datalog/</a> .</p>

<h2 id="sql-loops-and-csp">SQL, Loops, and CSP</h2>

<p>From a more imperative perspective, SELECT-FROM-WHERE statements are basically for loops. SQL is an odd language in that the FROM comes after the SELECT. This puts a row variables binding site after their usage points. Maybe this isn’t <em>that</em> crazy considering set comprehension <code>{x for x in A if x &gt; 0}</code> is quite similar.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>SQL</td>
      <td>Python</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>FROM mytable as row_a</code></td>
      <td><code>for row_a in mytable:</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>WHERE row_a.col1 = rowa.col2</code></td>
      <td><code>if row_a.col1 == row_a.col2:</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>SELECT row_a.col1, row_a.col2</code></td>
      <td><code>yield row_a.col1, row_a.col2</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>A thing SQL engines do is that they rearrange and optimize these loops and refactor them into joins and other things. Python for loops however execute just like you say it (slowly).</p>

<p>Search problems over finite spaces can be solved by brute force loops. Enumerate all possibilities and take the ones that work.</p>

<p>So in this manner SQL is a constraint solver.</p>

<p>An example constraint satisfaction puzzle is the send more money puzzle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_arithmetic">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_arithmetic</a> in which we need to find digits <code>S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y</code> such that <code>SEND + MORE = MONEY</code>.
A pure python version of the send more money puzzle with simplistic pruning is</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>solve_send_money</span><span>():</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>s</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>):</span>  <span># S must be non-zero

<p>Hmm. My system clang vs gcc is another 5x? That’s kind of surprising. I have a new clang (20) and an old gcc 11.4. Maybe that’s enough. The thing also that it may be rearranging the loops? If I try to add a counter, clang slows down to about gcc. Very interesting.</p>

<h2 id="relation-and-graph-homomorphisms">Relation and Graph Homomorphisms</h2>

<p>There is another perspective on what SQL is doing. It is finding a mapping (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism">homomorphism</a>) between the query and the database.</p>

<p>We have intuition about databases that comes from typically thinking about small queries (&lt; 100 tables referenced in FROM statements) and big databases (millions, billions or more of rows).</p>

<p>The running time of naive nested loops is exponential in the number of loops. Considered as a function of the size the of query, database queries are quite computationally expensive.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_homomorphism">Graph homomorphisms</a> are a particular familiar case of a homomorphism. Graphs can be easily mapped into database tables as an edge table with two columns.</p>

<p>I have heard that I should be scared of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgraph_isomorphism_problem">subgraph matching</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism">graph isomorphism</a> because they are NP ish. But in many common cases, the size of the patterns is pretty small, and the size of the database is pretty big. So the problem is not that hard.</p>

<p>Here for example I can turn a networkx graph into a sqlite table</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>sqlite3</span>
<span>import</span> <span>networkx</span> <span>as</span> <span>nx</span>

    <span>con</span><span>.</span><span>executemany</span><span>(</span><span>"INSERT INTO edges VALUES (?, ?)"</span><span>,</span> <span>G</span><span>.</span><span>edges</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>G</span><span>.</span><span>is_directed</span><span>():</span>
        <span>con</span><span>.</span><span>executemany</span><span>(</span><span>"INSERT INTO edges VALUES (?, ?)"</span><span>,</span> <span>[(</span><span>j</span><span>,</span><span>i</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span><span>j</span> <span>in</span> <span>G</span><span>.</span><span>edges</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And conversely export the edge table back out into a networkx graph.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>graph_of_db</span><span>(</span><span>con</span><span>):</span>
    <span>G</span> <span>=</span> <span>nx</span><span>.</span><span>DiGraph</span><span>()</span>

<p>The form of these simple <code>FROM-SELECT-WHERE</code> queries (conjuctive queries) is remarkably similar to a database itself, but with symbolic entries. Each FROM would become a row in this symbolic database. We can for example convert a graph also into a query that will find the image of the graph in the database. The solutions to this query are graph homomorphisms. When codegenning SQL I find maintaining separate <code>select</code> <code>from</code> <code>where</code> lists to be a useful thing.</p>

<p>Query containment. Since you can make a sql query to find homomorphisms, you can check query containment as a sql query itself. Isn’t that fun?</p>

<p>The symbolic database as a herbrand model.</p>

<p>Gra</p>

<p>I’ve never seriously used a graph database, but I kind of can’t see the appeal for this reason. I find pretty often modelling domains as graphs to not actually map that well because I want a notion of ordering.</p>

<p>I really had this one rotting in my draft backlog for a long time. Good to just dump stuff out.</p>

<h2 id="sql-model-check">SQL model check</h2>

<p>SQL is a model checker for first order logic. SQL + something like NOT and EXISTS statements can express any first order logic statement.</p>

<p>Model checking has a connotation of being about temporal logic, or software system checking. But the term itself is talking about literally checking a model satisfies a formula <code>M |= t</code>. Model checking is a general concept that can be applied to any logic with a notion of smenantics.</p>

<p>Model checking is also kind of saying there is a kind of homomorphism between the syntax and semantics.</p>

<p>This is also a confusion that we have in talking about the “complexity” of a logic. The ocmplexity depends on which question we are asking. Are me asking satisfiability or model checking? Satisfiiability is also aasking about the <code>M |= t</code> models question, but it is of the form <code>formula -&gt; option model</code> rather than the form <code>model -&gt; formula -&gt; bool</code>. The moding of the question is different.</p>

<p>When people talk about SAT being NP, they are talking about the satisfiability problem.
When they talk about existential second order logic being NP, they are talking about the model checking problem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fagin%27s_theorem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fagin%27s_theorem</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_complexity_theory">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_complexity_theory</a></p>

<p>SQL queries are enumerating homomorphisms between the query and the database. This perspective puts the query and the database on smilar footing, which feels odd.</p>

<p>As a subcase of this capability, if the database is holding an edge table and attributes, then a query is a graph homomorphism solver.
If we dymmetrically place two graphs into the database and in a query, we can enumerate isomoprhisms. Isn’t that fun?</p>

<p>Another perspective is that the query is a formula, and the database is a model of the formula.</p>

<p>We are used to small queries and large databases, but this is not a definition</p>

<p>A perspective on what a constraint satisfaction problem is is that is is a homomorphism problem.
For example, graph coloring is a homomorphism from a graph to a complete graph of colors (with no self edges).</p>

<p>Constraint satisfaction is an assignment to variables values frm their domain subject to constraints. The particular connectivty of a problem can be represented by a hypergraph. The target structure represents the domains the variables can take on, and the constraint hyperedges map to a relation representing the constraint.
A class of CSP problems is allowing the connecvtivity graph to vary, while keeping the target (the types of constraints fixed). Is this a useful characterization? Eh. It’s interesting that it ties into other mathemtical topicas.</p>

<p>The naive solution of a constraint satsifaction problem is to just make a big sequence of loops, pruning / breaking with checks that constraint are satisifed. We want to push the checks as high as possible.
This a a very static perspective.
More dynammically, we want to pick the variable ordering inside the choice branches. This is more of a backtracking feel. We do proppagation to disallow subchoices</p>

<p>A problem that is easy to embed into database queries is graph homomomorphism. Queries and databases feel very different, but they are more symettric than you might think.</p>

<p>In typical usage, queries are small and databases are large.
A graph coloring problem can be mdelled as fnding a graph homomorphism into a complete graph. This flips the intuition on it’s head with a large query and small database. Examples like these are better served probably by a constraint satisfaction solver or SAT style techniques.</p>

<p>The middle ground of roughly equal graphs is a graph isomorphism problem. Custom solvers like nauty exist for this case too.</p>

<p>Graph coloring can be solved through dynamic programming. If we cut up a graph, we only need to know if it can be colored with particular choices at interfaces. Choosing interfaces like this is a graph partitioning problem, but also is a tree decomposition.</p>

<p>One of the things that I found appealing about category theory is that it presents a design methodology to convert things that look graph-like like string diagrams into term-like expresssions of combinators.</p>

<p>Hmm. python-metis is not a thing anymore? Just pip install metis, it works with networkx anyway</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          

            <p>Undergraduates with family income below $200,000 can expect to attend MIT tuition-free starting next fall, thanks to newly expanded financial aid. Eighty percent of American households meet this income threshold.</p><p>And&nbsp;for&nbsp;the 50 percent of American families with income below $100,000, parents can expect to pay nothing at all toward the&nbsp;full cost of their&nbsp;students’ MIT education,&nbsp;which includes tuition as well as housing, dining, fees, and an allowance for books and personal expenses.</p><p>This $100,000 threshold is up from $75,000 this year, while next year’s $200,000 threshold for tuition-free attendance will increase from its current level of $140,000.</p><p>These new steps to enhance MIT’s affordability for students and families are the latest in a long history of efforts by the Institute to free up more resources to make an MIT education as affordable and accessible as possible. Toward that end, MIT has earmarked $167.3 million in need-based financial aid this year for undergraduate students — up some 70 percent from a decade ago.</p><p>“MIT’s distinctive model of education — intense, demanding, and rooted in science and engineering — has profound practical value to our students and to society,” MIT President Sally Kornbluth says. “As the&nbsp;<em>Wall Street Journal&nbsp;</em>recently reported, MIT is better at improving the financial futures of its graduates than any other U.S. college, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-universities-graduate-jobs-global-university-employability-ranking" title="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-universities-graduate-jobs-global-university-employability-ranking">the Institute also ranks number one in the world for the employability of its graduates</a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>“The cost of college is a real concern for families across the board,” Kornbluth adds, “and we’re determined to make this transformative educational&nbsp;experience available to the most talented students, whatever their financial circumstances.&nbsp;So, to every student out there who dreams of coming to MIT: Don’t let concerns about cost stand in your way.”</p><p>MIT is&nbsp;<a href="https://sfs.mit.edu/undergraduate-students/the-cost-of-attendance/making-mit-affordable/" title="https://sfs.mit.edu/undergraduate-students/the-cost-of-attendance/making-mit-affordable/">one of only nine colleges</a>&nbsp;in the US that does&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;consider applicants’ ability to pay as part of its admissions process and that meets the full demonstrated financial need&nbsp;⁠for all undergraduates.&nbsp;MIT does not expect students on aid to take loans, and,&nbsp;unlike many other institutions, MIT does&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;provide an admissions advantage to the children of alumni or donors. Indeed, 18 percent of current MIT undergraduates are first-generation college students.</p><p>“We believe MIT should be the preeminent destination for the most talented students in the country interested in an education centered on science and technology, and accessible to the best students regardless of their financial circumstances,” says Stu Schmill, MIT’s dean of admissions and student financial services.</p><p>“With the need-based financial aid we provide today, our education is much more affordable now than at any point in the past,” adds Schmill, who graduated from MIT in 1986, “even though the ‘sticker price’ of MIT is higher now than it was when I was an undergraduate.”</p><p>Last year, the median annual cost paid by an MIT undergraduate receiving financial aid was $12,938⁠, allowing 87 percent of students in the Class of 2024 to graduate debt-free. Those who did borrow graduated with median debt of $14,844. At the same time, graduates benefit from the&nbsp;<a href="https://sfs.mit.edu/undergraduate-students/the-cost-of-attendance/return-on-investment/">lifelong&nbsp;value</a> of an MIT degree, with an average starting salary of $126,438 for graduates entering industry, according to MIT’s most recent survey of its graduating students.</p><p>MIT’s endowment — made up of generous gifts made by individual alumni and friends — allows the Institute to provide this level of financial aid, both now and into the future.</p><p>“Today’s announcement is a powerful expression of how much our graduates value their MIT experience,” Kornbluth says, “because our ability to provide financial aid of this scope depends on decades of individual donations to our endowment, from generations of MIT alumni and&nbsp;other&nbsp;friends.&nbsp;In effect, our endowment is an inter-generational gift from past MIT students&nbsp;to the students of today and tomorrow.”</p><p><strong>What MIT families can expect in 2025</strong></p><p>As noted earlier: Starting next fall, for families with income below $100,000, with typical assets, parents can expect to pay nothing for the full cost of attendance, which includes&nbsp;tuition, housing, dining, fees, and allowances for books and personal expenses.</p><p>For families with income from $100,000 to $200,000, with typical assets, parents can expect to pay on a sliding scale from $0 up to a maximum of around $23,970, which is this year’s total cost for MIT housing, dining, fees, and allowances for books and personal expenses.</p><p>Put another way, next year all MIT families with income below $200,000 can expect to contribute well below $27,146, which is the annual average cost for in-state students to attend and live on campus at public universities in the US, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college#average-total-cost-of-college">Education Data Initiative</a>. And even among families with income above $200,000, many still receive need-based financial aid from MIT, based on their unique financial circumstances. Families can use MIT’s online&nbsp;<a href="https://sfs.mit.edu/undergraduate-students/the-cost-of-attendance/estimate-your-cost/">calculators</a> to estimate the cost of attendance for their specific family.</p><p>This past summer, MIT’s faculty-led Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid was publicly charged by President Kornbluth with undertaking a review of the Institute’s&nbsp;admissions and financial aid policies, to ensure that MIT remains as fully accessible as possible to all students, regardless of their financial circumstances. The steps announced today are the first of these recommendations to be reviewed and adopted.</p>

    <p>Photogrammetry, AI, and digital preservation combine to create a digital twin of St. Peter’s Basilica with thousands of images, allowing visitors to explore it in detail from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Located in Vatican City, St. Peter’s Basilica is over 400 years old, and is one of the most well-known churches in the world revered for its breathtaking Renaissance and Baroque architecture. Famous architects like Michelangelo and Bernini contributed to the design of the church, which took over 100 years to complete.</p>

    <h2>Making history</h2>
<p>Taking photos of every detail of a massive historic cathedral and piecing them all together sounds daunting, especially in less than a month, but with AI, it’s possible. Iconem, a leader in digital preservation based in Paris, uses advanced photogrammetry and AI to create 3D replicas of the world’s most famous historic landmarks and archaeologial sites.</p>

<p>To make the <a href="https://virtual.basilicasanpietro.va/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3D version of St. Peter’s Basilica</a>, the Iconem team took over 400,000 high-resolution images using advanced photogrammetry techniques. They spent three weeks scanning the Basilica using various devices including drones, cameras, and lasers, and Azure processed&nbsp;the massive volume of images collected. This data was&nbsp;securely backed up and stored in Azure&nbsp;Cloud, making it accessible to partners.&nbsp;Iconem then created an ultra-precise 3D model, or a digital twin of the Basilica. AI-generated imagery taken from Iconem’s photogrammetry data enhanced visualization of both the interior and exterior of the Basilica, allowing visitors to explore every intricate detail from anywhere in the world.</p>

Microsoft’s AI for Good Lab contributed advanced tools that refined the digital twin with millimeter-level accuracy, and used AI to help detect and map structural vulnerabilities like cracks and missing mosaic tiles. The Vatican oversaw the collaboration, ensuring the preservation of the Basilica as a cultural, spiritual, and historically significant site for years to come.</p>

    <h2>An experience of a lifetime</h2>
<p>In November 2024, ahead of the the 2025 Holy Year Jubilee, both the public exhibition and digital platforms of St. Peter’s Basilica will be available for everyone to see and experience in the Pétros enì exhibit. The Holy Year Jubilee occurs every 25 years as a year of grace and pilgrimage in the Roman Catholic church. During this time, Catholics are encouraged to take a pilgrimage to Rome where they can participate in ceremonies, religious events, and focus on spiritual renewal. “Pilgrims of Hope” is the theme of the 2025 Holy Year Jubilee.</p>
<p>The Pétros enì exhibit will give the 35 million pilgrims in Rome an immersive, in-person experience of a lifetime, and it will also help more than a billion Catholics unable to make the trip feel like they’re in the moment.</p>

    <p><img src="https://catonmat.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/unix-utilities.jpg" alt="Unix Utilities">Hi all! I'm starting a new article series here. This one is going to be about Unix utilities that you should know about. The articles will discuss one Unix program at a time. I'll try to write a good introduction to the tool and give as many examples as I can think of.</p>
<p>The first post in this series is going to be about a not so well known but super powerful Unix program called <strong>Pipe Viewer</strong> or <strong>pv</strong> for short. Pipe viewer is a terminal-based tool for monitoring the progress of data through a pipeline. It can be inserted into any normal pipeline between two processes to give a visual indication of how quickly the data is passing through, how long it has taken, how near to completion it is, and an estimate of how long it will be until completion. </p>
<p>Pipe viewer is written by <a href="http://www.ivarch.com/">Andrew Wood</a>, an experienced Unix sysadmin. The homepage of pv utility is here: <a href="http://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml">pv utility</a>.</p>
<p>If you feel like you are interested in this stuff, I suggest that you subscribe to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/catonmat">my rss feed</a> to receive my future posts automatically.</p>
<h2>How to use pv?</h2>
<p>Let's start with some really easy examples and progress to more complicated ones.</p>
<p>Suppose that you have a file <code>access.log</code> that is a tens of gigabytes in size and contains web logs. You want to compress it into a smaller file, let's say a gunzip archive (.gz). The obvious way to do it is:</p>
<pre>$ gzip -c access.log &gt; access.log.gz
</pre>
<p>As the file is so huge (tens of gigabytes), you have no idea how long to wait. Will it finish soon? Or will it take another 30 mins?</p>
<p>By using <code>pv</code> you can precisely time how long it will take:</p>
<pre>$ pv access.log | gzip &gt; access.log.gz
&lt;strong&gt;611MB 0:00:11 [58.3MB/s] [=&gt;      ] 15% ETA 0:00:59&lt;/strong&gt;
</pre>
<p>Pipe viewer acts as <code>cat</code> here, except it also adds a progress bar. We can see that gzip processed 611MB of data in 11 seconds. It has processed 15% of all data and it will take 59 more seconds to finish. So no coffee break.</p>
<p>You can stick several <code>pv</code> processes in your pipeline. For example, you can time how fast the data is being read from the disk with one <code>pv</code> and how much data has been gzipped via a second <code>pv</code>:</p>
<pre html="">$ pv -cN source access.log | gzip | pv -cN gzip &gt; access.log.gz
&lt;strong&gt;source:  760MB 0:00:15 [37.4MB/s] [=&gt;     ] 19% ETA 0:01:02
  gzip: 34.5MB 0:00:15 [1.74MB/s] [  &lt;=&gt;  ]&lt;/strong&gt;
</pre>
<p>Here we have specified the <code>-N</code> parameter to <code>pv</code> to create a named stream. The <code>-c</code> parameter makes sure the output is not garbaged by one pv process writing over the other.</p>
<p>This example shows that the <code>access.log</code> file is being read at the speed of 37.4MB/s but gzip is writing data at only 1.74MB/s. We can immediately calculate the compression rate. It's 37.4/1.74 = 21x!</p>
<p>Notice how <code>gzip</code> doesn't include how much data is left or how fast it will finish. It's because the <code>pv</code> process after <code>gzip</code> has no idea how much data <code>gzip</code> will produce (it's just outputting compressed data from input stream). The first pv process, however, knows how much data is left, because it's reading it from a known file.</p>
<p>Another similar example is be to pack the whole directory of files into a compressed tarball:</p>
<pre>$ tar -czf - . | pv &gt; out.tgz
&lt;strong&gt; 117MB 0:00:55 [2.7MB/s] [&gt;         ]&lt;/strong&gt;
</pre>
<p>In this example, <code>pv</code> only shows the output rate of the <code>tar -czf</code> command. It has no information about how bit the directory is or how long the <code>tar</code> process will run or how much data is left. We need to provide the total size of data we are tarring to pv. It can be done this way:</p>
<pre html="">$ tar -cf - . | pv -s $(du -sb . | awk '{print $1}') | gzip &gt; out.tgz
&lt;strong&gt; 253MB 0:00:05 [46.7MB/s] [&gt;     ]  1% ETA 0:04:49&lt;/strong&gt;
</pre>
<p>What happens here is we tell tar to recursively (default mode) create (<code>-c</code> argument) an archive of all files in current dir (<code>.</code> argument) and output the data to stdout <code>-f - argument</code>. Next, we specify the size <code>-s</code> argument to pv of all files in current dir and all its subdirectories. The <code>du -sb . | awk '{print $1}'</code> command returns number of bytes in current dir and it's fed as the <code>-s</code> parameter to pv. Next, we gzip the content and output the result to <code>out.tgz</code> file. This way <code>pv</code> knows how much data is still left to be processed and shows us that it will take another 4 mins 49 secs to finish. So you can take a quick coffee break.</p>
<p>Another interesting example is copying large amounts of data over the network via the <code>nc</code> (netcat) utility that I will write about some other time.</p>
<p>(Update: Just wrote about it: <a href="https://catonmat.net/unix-utilities-netcat">Netcat – A Unix Utility You Should Know About</a>.)</p>
<p>Suppose you have two computers A and B. You want to transfer a directory from A to B very quickly. The fastest way to do it is to use <code>tar</code> and <code>nc</code>, and time the operation with <code>pv</code>.</p>
<p>On computer A with IP address 192.168.1.100 run this command:</p>
<pre>$ tar -cf - /path/to/dir | pv | nc -l -p 6666 -q 5
</pre>
<p>On computer B run this command:</p>
<pre>$ nc 192.168.1.100 6666 | pv | tar -xf -
</pre>
<p>That's it! All the files in <code>/path/to/dir</code> on computer A will get transferred to computer B, and you'll be able to see how fast the operation is going.</p>
<p>This will show how fast the data is being transferred but it won't show how much data is left. If you want this information, then you have to do the <code>pv -s $(...)</code> trick from the previous example and add it to <code>pv</code> on computer A.</p>
<p>Here's another fun example. It shows how fast the computer reads from <code>/dev/zero</code>:</p>
<pre>$ pv /dev/zero &gt; /dev/null
 157GB 0:00:38 [4.17GB/s]
</pre>
<p>That's it. I hope you enjoyed this post and learned something new. I love explaining things and teaching!  </p>
<h2>How to install pv?</h2>
<p>If you're on Debian or Debian based system such as Ubuntu do the following:</p>
<pre>$ sudo aptitude install pv
</pre>
<p>If you're on Fedora or Fedora based system such as CentOS do:</p>
<pre>$ sudo yum install pv
</pre>
<p>If you're on Mint, do:</p>
<pre>$ sudo apt-get install pv
</pre>
<p>If you're on Slackware, go to <a href="http://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml">pv homepage</a>, download the pv-version.tar.gz archive and do:</p>
<pre>$ tar -zxf pv-version.tar.gz
$ cd pv-version
$ ./configure &amp;&amp; sudo make install
</pre>
<p>If you're a Mac user:</p>
<pre>$ sudo port install pv
</pre>
<p>If you're OpenSolaris user:</p>
<pre>$ pfexec pkg install pv
</pre>

$ make
$ make install
</pre>
<p>The manual of the utility can be found here <a href="http://www.ivarch.com/programs/quickref/pv.shtml">man pv</a>.</p>

The US has the largest road network in the world, about 4.3 million miles of road, and Americans </span><a href="https://frontiergroup.org/resources/fact-file-americans-drive-most/" rel="">drive much more</a><span> than residents in most other countries. Good-quality roads are important for a functioning economy, and rough roads </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31981/w31981.pdf" rel="">inflict costs</a><span> in the form of reduced vehicle speeds.</span></p><p>How good is American road infrastructure? How does it compare with roads built in other countries?</p><p>Overall, the quality of US interstates is very high, while the quality of roads in major cities is quite poor. And while there’s some anecdotal evidence that US roads are worse than European roads, I wasn’t able to find much international road quality data to compare. The limited data I found points to the US not being a huge outlier in road quality. But more data is needed to compare accurately.</p><p><span>The most common metric for measuring road quality is the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_roughness_index" rel="">International Roughness Index</a><span> (IRI). The IRI measures how much a car moves vertically as it travels over a given distance, and is typically given in units like “inches per mile” or “millimeters per meter.” Lower IRI is better: the rougher the road, the more the car bounces up and down, and the higher the IRI. As we’ll see, standards for road quality vary from country to country, but a “good” IRI is generally in the neighborhood of 95 inches per mile / 1.5 millimeters per meter or less.</span></p><p><span>Data on US road quality is provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) at the </span><a href="https://www.bts.gov/content/condition-us-roadways-functional-system" rel="">national</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.bts.gov/road-condition" rel="">state</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2022/hm73.cfm" rel="">city level</a><span>. It’s not 100% clear to me what’s included in this data, or what the selection criteria is. It definitely includes essentially all of the Interstate System, as well as other major highways that make up the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_System_(United_States)" rel="">National Highway System</a><span>. But the National Highway System has on the order of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_System_(United_States)" rel="">160,000 miles</a><span>, while there is quality data for around 800,000 miles worth of road. Presumably the other 640,000 miles are other important roads outside of the highway system. Regardless, the roads we have quality data for are only a fraction (around 19%) of the US’s total road network.</span></p><p>To start, let’s look at overall road quality, broken down by whether they’re interstate highways or not, and whether they’re urban or rural roads.</p><p><span>Note: The FHWA uses slightly different category breakdowns in different places. Some places it uses </span><a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/pubs/hf/pl11028/chapter7.cfm" rel="">three categories</a><span>, some places </span><a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2022/hm73.cfm" rel="">it uses five</a><span>, and some places it uses </span><a href="https://www.bts.gov/content/condition-us-roadways-functional-system" rel="">a different five</a><span>. I’ve used the categories given in the national level statistics. These are consistent with the three-level categorization used elsewhere, with an additional “very good” and “very poor” labels I’ve assigned to &lt; 60 and &gt; 220 IRI. Note that state DOTs might use their own, slightly different quality categories.</span></p><p><span>US interstates are fairly good quality, with more than 80% of mileage good or very good, and only a tiny fraction of mileage (around 3%) poor or very poor. Non-interstate roads are, unsurprisingly, less good, with only around 40% of measured mileage good or better, and 20% poor or worse. Interestingly, in all cases urban roads are worse quality than rural roads, presumably because they see higher traffic than rural roads. More than a third of non-interstate urban roads are poor quality or worse. And remember, this data is just a fraction of total US road mileage (which includes more than a million miles of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_road_network_size" rel="">unpaved roads</a><span>). Presumably average quality of the total non-interstate road network is even worse.</span></p><p>We can also see how road quality has changed over time. Over the last 30 years, interstate quality has been steadily improving, while non-interstate has been fairly flat.</p><p>We can also look at a state-by-state breakdown. For interstates, there’s not a huge amount of variation: only four states have less than 60% of their roads good quality or better, and almost every state has less than 10% of its interstate mileage poor quality or worse.</p><p><span>With non-interstates, we see more variation. Broadly, highly rural states tend to have higher quality roads than more urbanized states, though there’s a decent amount of variation. California, which is reasonably rural, nevertheless comes in third from the bottom. Interestingly, I expected cold places to have lower road quality in general due to things like </span><a href="https://orf.od.nih.gov/TechnicalResources/Documents/Technical%20Bulletins/19TB/The%20Freeze-Thaw%20Cycle%20in%20Concrete%20and%20Brick%20Assemblies%20January%202019-Technical%20Bulletin_508.pdf" rel="">freeze-thaw cycles</a><span> and the impact of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Belt" rel="">road salting</a><span>, but there doesn’t seem to be much correlation. Plenty of cold places (North Dakota, Wyoming, Minnesota) have good-quality roads, while plenty of warm places (Louisiana, New Mexico, California) have poor-quality roads.</span></p><p><span>We can also look at the road quality of individual cities. Below is road quality (non-interstate) for the 19 largest metro areas in the US.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-151890432" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-good-are-american-roads#footnote-1-151890432" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><p>While urban roads are poor in general, there’s a large amount of variation. Cities like Atlanta and Minneapolis have less than 10% of their roads are poor quality or worse, while more than 60% of the roads in San Francisco and Los Angeles are poor. But in general, most major cities aren’t doing great: in 13 of the 19 largest US cities, more than 1/3rd of the roads are poor quality. And here again we see that cold climate doesn’t seem to have much impact on road quality, with cold places like Minneapolis and New York near the top, while warm cities like Los Angeles, San Diego and Dallas are near the bottom.</p><p>So US interstates seem high-quality, while urban roads are often quite poor. How does this compare to other countries?</p><p><span>It’s unfortunately not easy to tell. The US ranks very highly in the international </span><a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/road-quality-by-country" rel="">Roads Quality Index</a><span> (11th in the world, as of 2019), but this is based on a survey of the perceptions of business leaders about road quality, not actual road data. A </span><a href="https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2022/English/wpiea2022095-print-pdf.ashx" rel="">2022 IMF study</a><span> of various countries’ road quality ranked the US best in the world, but it relied on estimated travel speeds between major cities using Google Maps data, not actual road roughness. While the IRI is commonly used by countries around the world to measure road quality, I had a very hard time finding any international datasets comparable to FHWA data.</span></p><p><span>But I was able to scrape together a few. </span><a href="https://www.orr.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2023-10/trl-report-on-benchmarking-the-condition-of-highway-networks.pdf" rel="">This 2023 report</a><span> from the UK compares highway quality in England, Wales, Scotland, and the Netherlands, and provides a high-level summary of IRI data.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-151890432" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-good-are-american-roads#footnote-2-151890432" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> </span><a href="https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/01dfc06c-6ef0-4fd0-a010-8ba20e3c9d10" rel="">This Canadian website</a><span> gives IRI data up to 2021 for the provincial highways in Ontario. </span><a href="https://www.tii.ie/media/n45jg5jx/tii-national-roads-network-indicators-2017.pdf" rel="">This presentation</a><span> gives some summary IRI statistics for Ireland’s national roads as of 2017, and </span><a href="https://www.instituteofasphalt.org/requirements/papers/61_2.pdf" rel="">this one</a><span> gives some IRI data for Irish regional roads as of 2018.</span></p><p>Because these countries use somewhat different roughness categories, I graphed each of these, along with US interstate and non-interstate roads, using a cumulative distribution function, which gradually adds the fraction of roads at different IRI levels. The farther the curve is to the left, the larger the fraction of roads at a lower IRI, and the higher quality the road network.</p><p><span>For most of the international sources, the data is for the national or provincial highway network, major roads which (as far as I can tell) are roughly equivalent to the US National Highway System. The exception is the Irish regional road data, which I believe are a lower tier of road.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-151890432" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-good-are-american-roads#footnote-3-151890432" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3db68aee-b358-485c-94ba-3476e7585040_1600x1208.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3db68aee-b358-485c-94ba-3476e7585040_1600x1208.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3db68aee-b358-485c-94ba-3476e7585040_1600x1208.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3db68aee-b358-485c-94ba-3476e7585040_1600x1208.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3db68aee-b358-485c-94ba-3476e7585040_1600x1208.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3db68aee-b358-485c-94ba-3476e7585040_1600x1208.png" width="1456" height="1099" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3db68aee-b358-485c-94ba-3476e7585040_1600x1208.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1099,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3db68aee-b358-485c-94ba-3476e7585040_1600x1208.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3db68aee-b358-485c-94ba-3476e7585040_1600x1208.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3db68aee-b358-485c-94ba-3476e7585040_1600x1208.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3db68aee-b358-485c-94ba-3476e7585040_1600x1208.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>We see that US interstates compare very well; as good or better than the national road networks in every other country for which there’s data. US non-interstates do less well: about 90% of Dutch national roads are “good” by US standards, for instance, whereas only around 40% of US non-interstates are. Nevertheless, the US doesn’t seem to be a huge outlier: its roads seem to be roughly as good as British national roads, for instance. I’m also assuming that the US data includes a lot of lower-importance/quality roads beyond the national system that drag its average down.

It’s of course hard to weigh a report from more than 30 years ago too heavily, but the 2023 UK report mentioned above also notes that Dutch highways, which were of higher quality than UK highways, were resurfaced much more frequently.

But you can also make pavement out of conventional Portland cement concrete, complete with steel reinforcing.

<p>
GNU Artanis was born in 2013, and it's a web application framework written in Guile Scheme. It's designed to be simple and easy to use, and it's suitable for small to medium web applications. It's licensed under GPLv3+ and LGPLv3.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning, Artanis was largely inspired by Ruby on Rails to generate the scaffold code as possible. And the URL remapping API was inspired by Sinatra, another web framework of Ruby. That's why it's named "Artanis", since it's the revserse of "Sinatra".
</p>

<p>
But as time goes by, Artanis has its own features and design.
</p>

<p>
The first convention of Artanis is "Scheme only", we don't intend to write C code for extension as possible, unless it's really necessary. So far, we still don't have any C code in Artanis. The contributors may provide extension in C, but the Artanis core is still pure Scheme. That's because GNU Guile provides great features to interact with C libraries, which is the original reason why Guile exists.
</p>

<p>
The default server core of Artanis is named "Ragnarok", which is high performance asynchronous non-blocking server design based on co-routine. Notably, the co-routine is implemented in pure Scheme feature called Delimited Continuation.
</p>

<p>
GNU Artanis is both the official project of GNU operating system, and <a href="https://hardenedlinux.org/">HardenedLinux community</a>.

<p>On May 12th, 1940 the 31st Panzer Regiment, assigned to the 5th Panzer Division, attempted to capture a bridge over the Meuse River at Yvoir. The bridge was demolished by 1st Lieutenant De Wispelaere of the Belgian Engineers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Werner Advance Detachment (under Oberst Paul Hermann Werner, commander, 31st Panzer Regiment), which belonged to the 5th Panzer Division, under Rommel’s command... Werner received a message from close support air reconnaissance in the afternoon that the bridge at Yvoir (seven kilometers north of Dinant) was still intact. He (Werner) immediately ordered Leutnant [Heinz] Zobel’s armored assault team of two armored scout cars and one Panzer platoon to head to the bridge at top speed... Belgian engineers under the command of 1st Lieutenant de Wispelaere had prepared the bridge for demolition while a platoon of Ardennes Light Infantry and elements of a French infantry battalion screened the bridge... Although the last soldiers had already passed the bridge, de Wispelaere delayed the demolition because civilian refugees were still approaching... two German armored scout cars charged toward the bridge while the following three Panzers opened fire. De Wispelaere immediately pushed the electrical ignition, but there was no explosion... Wispelaere now left his shelter and worked the manual ignition device. Trying to get back to his bunker, he was hit by a burst from a German machine gun and fell to the ground, mortally wounded. At the same time, the explosive charge went off. After the gigantic smoke cloud had drifted away, only the remnants of the pillars could be seen.</p>

<p>A few kilometers south at Houx, the Germans used a portion of a pontoon bridge (Bruckengerat B) rated to carry 16 tons to ferry their 25 ton tanks across.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By noon on May 13, Pioniere completed an eight-ton ferry and crossed twenty anti-tank guns to the west bank, however to maintain the tempo of his divisions advance, he needed armor and motorized units across the river. Rommel personally ordered the ferry converted to a heavier sixteen-ton variant to facilitate the crossing of the light Panzers and armored cars. Simultaneously, the Pioniere began construction on a bridge capable of crossing the division’s heavier Panzers and motorized units.</p>

<p>The panzer IV of Lieutenant Zabel [sic] of the 31. Panzer Regiment of the 5. Panzer-Division, on May 13, 1940, in Houx, as good as underwater except for the vehicle commander’s cupola. Close to the west bank, at the pontoon crossing site and later site of 5. Panzer Division bridge, a 16 tonne ferry (Bruckengerat B) gave way to the approaching shoreline, likely due to the rotating movement of the panzer, which turned right when disembarking (the only possible direction to quickly leave the Meuse’s shore due to the wall created by the rail line). The tank would be fished out in 1941 during the reconstruction of the bridge.</p>

<h2>The Man</h2>
<p>Sometime later the photograph was taken of a German pioneer infantryman looking at the tank. Later the tank was recovered and its ultimate fate is unknown.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Available evidence suggests the soldier in the photo is a Pioneer/Tank recovery crew, holding a Kar98k and wearing an EM/NCO'S Drill &amp; Work uniform, more commonly known as “Drillich”.</p>
<p>His role is proven by the presence of pontoon ferries on the Meuse river, used by the 5th Panzer Division. That is also proven by his uniform, which, as evidence suggests, was used during work to prevent damage to their standard woolen uniform.</p>

<hr>
<h2>My own speculation and research prior to the discovery.</h2>
<p>While I can't identify the photo, I can narrow down the tank. I believe it is a Panzer IV D.</p>
<p>It has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.5_cm_KwK_37" rel="noreferrer">short barrelled 7.5 cm KwK 37</a> narrowing it down to a Panzer IV Ausf. A through F1 or a <a href="https://www.worldwarphotos.info/gallery/germany/tanks-2-3/panzer3n/" rel="noreferrer">Panzer III N</a>.</p>
<p>Both had very similar turrets, but the Panzer III N has a wider gun mantlet, a more angular shroud, and lacked (or covered) the distinctive angular view ports (I believe they're view ports) on either side of the turret face.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/gt6vR.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/gt6vR.jpg" alt="Panzer III N in Italy 1944"></a></p>

<p>This leaves the Panzer IV. The distinctive cupola was added in model B. The external gun mantlet was added in model D.</p>

<p>Note the front half of the turret top is smooth. There is a protrusion to the front left of the cupola (I believe it's a periscope sight) and another circular opening to the front right. Finally, note the large ventilation hatch just in front of the cupola.</p>
<p>Model E would eliminate the ventilation hatch and replace it with a fan. The periscope was replaced with a hatch for signal flags.</p>

<p>Panzer IV model D entered mass production in October 1939 which means it would be too late for Poland, but could have seen service in France, Norway, or the Soviet Union.</p>
<hr>
<p>As for the soldier...</p>
<p>The rifle has a turned down bolt handle, a bayonet lug (missing from late rifles), a distinctive disassembly disc on the side of the stock (also missing from late rifles), no front site hood (indicative of an early rifle), and you can just about make out extra detail in the nose cap (also early). This is likely an early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karabiner_98k" rel="noreferrer">Karabiner 98k</a> which is missing its cleaning rod.

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1_oUtCGIqUMbIyRPeJsSyw" rel="noreferrer">ConeOfArc</a> posted a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaRO_dTqO1E&amp;list=WL" rel="noreferrer"><em>The Search for Panzer of the Lake</em></a>.</p>
<p>He broke down what he could identify about the solder, probably German.</p>
<ul>
<li>German winter style lower.</li>
<li>German wool tunic.</li>
<li>M34 Army Standard cap.</li>
<li>Kar98 rifle missing the cleaning rod.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the tank he confirms it's a Panzer IV D using similar criteria I used and he found <a href="https://i.sstatic.net/cmPAz.jpg" rel="noreferrer">two additional photos of what appear to be the same tank</a> claiming to be from the Western front in 1940.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/43hSO.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/43hSO.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://i.sstatic.net/Tcmqv.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.sstatic.net/Tcmqv.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>He then found a <a href="https://hitriy-plan.livejournal.com/441311.html" rel="noreferrer">Russian source</a> claiming it was found in Romania at the onset of Barbarossa in 1941.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that's all for now. ConeOfArc has put a bounty of $100 US for definitive proof of the tank's location. More detail can be had on ConeOfArc's Discord.</p>

<p>As a technology reporter, I like to think I’m an early adopter. I<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2372273-what-is-going-on-with-twitter-and-should-i-move-to-bluesky-instead/"> first signed up to the social network Bluesky around 18 months ago</a>, when the platform saw a small surge in users disaffected by Elon Musk’s approach to <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2383886-why-is-twitter-becoming-x-and-should-you-move-to-threads-or-bluesky/">what was then still called Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>It didn’t stick. Like many, I found the lure of Twitter too strong, and let my Bluesky account wither, but in recent weeks I have returned – and I am not alone. With Musk continuing to transform his social platform, now called X, at the same time as taking a role in US president-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming government, the Xodus has begun. Bluesky has gained <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rose.bsky.team/post/3lb6w3q3tsu2d">12 million users in two months</a>, and has just surpassed 20 million users. This time I intend on sticking around – and I think others will, too.</p>
    
<p>In large part, that’s because I want a social media experience without being bombarded by hate speech, gore and pornographic videos – all of which users of X have complained about in recent months. But I’m also big on Bluesky because I think it signals a shift in how social media works on a more fundamental level.</p>
<span></span><p>Social media algorithms – the computer code that decides what each user is shown – have long been a point of contentious debate. Fears of disappearing down “rabbit holes” of radicalisation, or being trapped in “<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2128426-has-the-social-media-political-bubble-theory-just-been-popped/">echo chambers</a>” of consensual, sometimes conspiratorial, viewpoints, have dominated scientific literature.</p>
<p>The use of algorithms to filter information has become the norm because chronologically presenting information from followers creates a confusing morass for the average user to process. Sorting and filtering what is important – or likely to keep users engaged – has become key to the success of platforms like Facebook, X and Instagram.</p>
<p>But control of these algorithms also gives you a big say in what people read. One of the bugbears many users have with X is its “For you” algorithm, which under Musk has seen commentary by and about him seemingly shoved into users’ timelines, even if they don’t directly follow him.</p>
<p>Bluesky’s approach isn’t to ditch algorithms – instead, it has more than the average social network. In a <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice">2023 blog post</a>, Jay Graber, Bluesky’s CEO, outlined the ethos of the platform. Bluesky promotes a “marketplace of algorithms”, she wrote, instead of a single “master algorithm”.</p>
    
<p>In practice, this means that users can see posts by people they follow on the app, the standard view Bluesky defaults to. But they can equally opt to see <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:z72i7hdynmk6r22z27h6tvur/feed/with-friends">what’s popular with friends</a>, an algorithmically-dictated selection of posts that your peers enjoy. There are <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:jfhpnnst6flqway4eaeqzj2a/feed/for-science">feeds specifically for scientists</a>, curated by those working in the field, or ones <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:w4xbfzo7kqfes5zb7r6qv3rw/feed/blacksky">to promote Black voices</a>, which are often thinned out by algorithmic filtering. One feed even specifically <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:vpkhqolt662uhesyj6nxm7ys/feed/infreq">promotes “quiet posters”</a> – users who post infrequently, and whose views would otherwise be drowned out by those who share every opinion with their followers.</p>
<p>This menu of options allows Bluesky to serve two purposes, bridging the past era of social media and the future one. The platform has the potential, once it reaches a critical mass of users, to act as the “de facto public town square”, as <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1507777261654605828?lang=en">Musk dubbed Twitter</a> before he purchased it. Bluesky arguably is the only remaining such square, given X has shifted to exclude many mainstream voices, and competitors like Threads choose to shy away from promoting politics and current affairs.</p>
<p>But Bluesky also allows you to tailor the app to your needs – not only through feeds, but other elements like starter packs of recommended users to quickly get involved in individual niches, or blocking tools to quieten unruly voices.</p>
<p>There are still hitches, undoubtedly. Finding the right feed for you can be tricky, while creating your own is even more complicated, requiring third-party tools. But the ability to get the full view of public conversation, then to drill down into smaller debates within clusters and communities of that broad swathe of society, is exciting. It’s a model of a new social media where users, not big companies or enigmatic individuals, are in charge of what they see. And if Bluesky continues to add users, it could become the norm. So come and join me – I’m <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stokel.bsky.social">@stokel.bsky.social</a>.</p>
