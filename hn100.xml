      White clouds drift over a combined wind-solar installation in Shandong province, China. Beijing’s support for a rapid rollout of solar and wind power forms a stark contrast with the growing antipathy of the Trump administration towards renewables.

<p>To the south of the Monte Cristo mountain range and west of Paymaster Canyon, a vast stretch of the Nevada desert has attracted modern-day prospectors chasing one of 21st-century America’s greatest investment booms.</p>
<p>Solar power developers want to cover an area larger than Washington, DC, with silicon panels and batteries, converting sunlight into electricity that will power air conditioners in sweltering Las Vegas along with millions of other homes and businesses.</p>
<p>But earlier this month, bureaucrats in charge of federal lands scrapped collective approval for the Esmeralda 7 projects, in what campaigners fear is part of an attack on renewable energy under President Donald Trump. “We will not approve wind or farmer destroying [sic] Solar,” he posted on his Truth Social platform in August. Developers will need to reapply individually, slowing progress.</p>
<p>Thousands of miles away on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, it is a different story. China has laid solar panels across an area the size of Chicago high up on the Tibetan Plateau, where the thin air helps more sunlight get through.</p>
<p>The Talatan Solar Park is part of China’s push to double its solar and wind generation capacity over the coming decade. “Green and low-carbon transition is the trend of our time,” President Xi Jinping told delegates at a UN summit in New York last month.</p>
<p>China’s vast production of solar panels and batteries has also pushed down the prices of renewables hardware for everyone else, meaning it has “become very difficult to make any other choice in some places,” according to Heymi Bahar, senior analyst at the International Energy Agency.</p>
<p>In 2010, the IEA estimated that there would be 410 gigawatts (GW) of solar panels installed around the world by 2035. There is already more than four times that capacity, with about half of it in China.</p>
<p>Many countries in Africa and the Middle East, even in petrostates such as Saudi Arabia, are rapidly developing solar power. “It’s a very cheap way to harness the sun,” says Kingsmill Bond, an energy strategist at think-tank Ember.</p>

<p>Its analysis suggests that, helped by rapid growth in solar and wind energy, renewables generated more electricity than coal-fired power plants during the first half of this year.</p>
<p>Progress in energy and other areas has damped some of the pessimism around global warming. In 2015, the UN predicted temperatures would rise by 4° C compared to pre-industrial levels by 2100. It now projects a rise of 2.6° C, if climate policies are followed through.</p>
<p>But for delegates set to gather in Belém, Brazil, next month for the COP30 climate summit, any jubilation will be tempered by the knowledge that the renewables revolution is a long way from being fulfilled. Emissions from the energy sector rose for the fourth straight year in 2024 to a record high, while the slower growth in US renewables means an ambitious target to triple global capacity by 2030 will probably be missed.</p>
<p>“It’s not job done, [IEA analysis] does throw some genuine caution out there,” says Mike Hemsley, deputy director at the Energy Transitions Commission think-tank.</p>
<p>Renewable energy has lowered wholesale power costs, but that has not necessarily fed through into the prices that consumers pay, while users in many countries have not yet switched to electricity for things like transport and domestic heating in the numbers required to reduce fossil fuel usage.</p>
<p>Calculations by the Energy Institute, the sector’s global body, show that the supply of oil, gas, and coal for energy—electricity generation, heating, industrial usage, and transport—in 2024 rose by more than the supply of energy from low-carbon sources, which also includes nuclear and hydropower. That has led some to argue that renewables are merely helping to meet climbing energy demand, rather than replacing fossil fuels.</p>
<p>“The world remains in an energy addition mode, rather than a clear transition,” said Andy Brown, president of the institute, as it launched its report in August.</p>

<h2>“Renewables is the place to be”</h2>
<p>At a solar farm operated by ReNew, one of India’s biggest green energy companies, hundreds of panels glint in the sharp desert sun of surrounding Rajasthan.</p>
<p>India, the world’s third largest carbon emitter, wants to develop 500 gigawatts of clean-energy capacity by 2030, and earlier this year reached 243 GW—meaning more than half of its current installed power capacity is now from renewables.</p>
<p>“Every group in India is now saying: ‘You know what, renewables is the place to be,” says Sumant Sinha, chair and chief executive of ReNew.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia, blessed with both oil and sun, has developed around 4.34 GW of solar capacity as it tries to free up more oil for export, rather than burning it in its own power stations. It wants to build up to 130 GW by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>“It’s massive, what’s going on,” Marco Arcelli, chief executive of utility ACWA Power, which is part-owned by the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, told the FT earlier this year. The company is developing 30 GW of renewables in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>South Africa has authorized at least 6 GW of renewable energy capacity since President Cyril Ramaphosa removed the capacity limit on private electricity providers in 2022, breaking years of reluctance among the ruling African National Congress to challenge the dominance of state monopoly utility Eskom.</p>

<p>Middle-class households in the country have also rapidly installed solar panels on their roofs to cope with years of planned rolling blackouts due to power shortages. It is part of a worldwide trend for smaller installations as homes and businesses tire of waiting for governments or big utilities to fix power shortages.</p>
<p>Solar panel installations of less than 1MW accounted for about 42 percent of global installations last year, according to BloombergNEF, almost double the 22 percent recorded in 2015. Factories, mosques, and farms in Pakistan have covered their roofs in Chinese-made solar panels to try to avoid surging tariffs for state-provided power.</p>

<p>“We’ve displaced tens of thousands of diesel generators,” says William Brent, chief marketing officer at Husk Power Systems, which has installed about 400 “mini-grids” of solar and batteries across Nigeria and India. These are helping pharmacies store medicines and shopkeepers keep drinks cool at around half the cost of power from the grid.</p>
<p>The construction of vast solar arrays in deserts and small installations on rooftops have largely been driven by the same underlying trend: falling costs. The huge surfeit of production capacity in China, which produced about eight out of 10 of the world’s solar modules in 2024, has pushed the cost of panels down by almost 90 percent over the past decade and dragged overall capital expenditure costs down 70 percent, according to analysts.</p>
<p>Yet even in places like India, fossil fuels still hold sway. Coal still generates more than 70 percent of the country’s power output and remains politically protected, employing hundreds of thousands directly and many more indirectly in some of India’s poorest regions. “India still has a massive way to go,” says Hemsley at the ETC.</p>
<p>PM Prasad, chair of state-owned Coal India, told the FT earlier this year that it was reopening more than 30 mines and launching up to five new sites, arguing that renewables were not yet capable of meeting fast-growing energy demand.</p>
<p>The painful process of acquiring large tracts of land for solar arrays in a country with millions of smallholder farmers has also led to delays across the renewables sector, many Indian developers grumble. More than 50 GW of renewable power projects are waiting to connect to an overstretched transmission network, estimates the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a think-tank, and cleantech consultancy JMK Research.</p>

<p>Even as solar panels become more popular in Sub-Saharan Africa, millions of homes and businesses still rely on expensive and polluting diesel generators, and roughly 600 million people lack access to power.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>Many people also lack the means to pay commercial rates for electricity, even before factoring in the extra levies needed to finance the cost of new transmission lines, a key enabler of renewables projects around the world.</p>
<p>Electricity storage capabilities also need to dramatically improve if countries want to rely more heavily on intermittent wind and solar farms and phase out backup fossil-fuel capacity.</p>
<p>Large-scale batteries are being deployed rapidly—spurred again by China’s prolific manufacturing output. James Mittell, director at developer Actis Energy, says costs have fallen so much that it is already possible in many markets to build large-scale battery and solar systems, which can deliver power with similar consistency to gas-fired power plants, but at lower cost. “It’s a complete game-changer,” he says.</p>
<p>But progress is also mixed on the second phase of any “transition” to renewable power: persuading consumers and industries to switch to equipment that runs on electricity rather than combustion processes using fossil fuels.</p>
<p>The share of electricity in final energy demand has flatlined in the US and the EU over the past few years, with the growth of electric cars offset by the difficulty of getting people to switch away from gas or oil heating systems to low-carbon electric ones such as heat pumps.</p>
<p>“For electricity [generation] we have a success story,” says Bahar, at the IEA. “For other sectors, it’s way more complicated.”</p>

<h2>Massive growth in China</h2>
<p>China and some parts of Southeast Asia stand out in terms of the portion of energy supplied by electricity increasing—in China’s case, from about 12 percent in 2000 to about 30 percent in 2023—as millions of citizens start driving electric cars and factories switch away from fossil-fueled boilers.</p>
<p>Ember points to data showing that renewables met 84 percent of China’s new electricity demand last year as evidence that coal-powered generation in the country is nearing its peak. “We’re confident renewables can meet all China’s [power] demand growth,” adds Hemsley at the ETC.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But even here, challenges loom. Major electricity market reforms introduced by Beijing in July mean renewable energy developers no longer get a fixed price akin to that received by coal-fired generators and are instead more exposed to market forces.</p>
<p>“They clearly don’t want to harm the build out of renewables, but they just want it to be done on a more commercial basis,” says Neil Beveridge, who leads Bernstein’s energy analysis in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>But the IEA warns it will lower returns and cut the growth of renewables. “That [impact of the reform] is the biggest uncertainty in our outlook,” adds Bahar at the IEA.</p>
<p>A far sharper slowdown is already underway in the US, where incentives introduced as part of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 are rolled back by the second Trump administration. Tax credits have been cut and major projects blocked—spooking investors and leaving existing developers trying to stay afloat.</p>

<p>“It’s very difficult to make big capital decisions based on this,” says Reagan Farr, chief executive of Silicon Ranch, a solar developer. “We don’t have a bipartisan energy policy in the US, which is very bad for the industry and our economy.”</p>
<p>Ørsted, the world’s largest offshore wind company, has had to raise an extra $9 billion from investors after Trump’s hostility to the offshore wind sector prevented it from selling a stake in one of its major US projects.</p>
<p>His tariffs on products from China mean higher costs for solar projects. Analysts say more large-scale solar projects are likely to have their permits revoked or reviewed.</p>
<p>Developers are currently rushing to build, as they have until July 2026 to start construction to capture the tail-end of the tax credits. But some projects and companies are bound to fail. “We’re likely facing several more years of uphill battles for many large-scale projects,” says Abby Watson, president at Groundwire Group, a consultancy.</p>

<p>The IEA has halved its forecast for renewables growth by 2030 in the US to around 250 GW as a result of Trump’s policies. Analysts at Carbon Brief estimate the country will emit 7 billion tonnes more CO₂ equivalent by 2030 under Trump’s policies than if the country had met its obligations under the 2015 Paris agreement, which he is withdrawing from.</p>
<p>The reduction in renewables growth comes as the country’s electricity demand is rising due to the growth of data centers, many of which are looking to gas-fired or nuclear power stations because they need constant, steady power.</p>

<p>Retail electricity prices have already risen by 5 percent since July, according to the Energy Information Administration, and some experts caution they could rise further if supplies are constrained. “The writing is on the wall,” says Pol Lezcano, director of energy and renewables at the CBRE real estate group.</p>
<p>Supporters of renewable electricity argue that the US is missing out on a revolution in cleaner, cheaper technology sweeping the world, with some likening it to the aging cars on Cuba’s roads.</p>
<p>But the relationship between renewable generation and consumer energy bills is complicated. The free energy from the sun or the wind means that the wholesale price of renewable-generated power is lower, but developers still need to make a return on their investment, and grid operators may need to step in to ensure continuity of supply when the wind and the sun are low.</p>
<p>“Even as the cost of producing electricity from renewables falls, consumers may not see immediate or proportional reductions in their bills, raising questions over the impact of renewables on power affordability,” the IEA said in its latest report.</p>
<p>More broadly, the US’s focus on fossil fuels and pullback of support for clean energy further cedes influence over the future global energy system to China.</p>
<p>The US is trying to tie its trading partners into fossil fuels, pressing the EU to buy $750 billion of American oil, natural gas, and nuclear technologies during his presidency as part of a trade deal, scuppering an initiative to begin decarbonizing world shipping and pressuring others to reduce their reliance on Chinese technology.</p>
<p>But the collapsing cost of solar panels in particular has spoken for itself in many parts of the world. Experts caution that the US’s attacks on renewables could cause lasting damage to its competitiveness against China, even if an administration more favorable to renewables were to follow Trump’s.</p>
<p>“China has run far away in terms of competitiveness,” says Antonio Cammisecra, chief executive of ContourGlobal, an independent power producer.</p>
<p>“The US is capable of rebuilding, but it will take time.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://danieldelaney.net/normal/">https://danieldelaney.net/normal/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45760878">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><a href="https://danieldelaney.net/" id="logo"><span>Dd</span></a>






<p>I’m the person my friends and family come to for computer-related help. (Maybe you, gentle reader, can relate.) This experience has taught me which computing tasks are frustrating for normal people.</p>

<p>Normal people often struggle with converting video. They will need to watch, upload, or otherwise do stuff with a video, but the format will be weird. (Weird, broadly defined, is anything that won’t play in QuickTime or upload to Facebook.)</p>

<p>I would love to recommend Handbrake to them, but the user interface is by and for power users. Opening it makes normal people feel unpleasant feelings.</p>



<p>This problem is rampant in free software. The FOSS world is full of powerful tools that only have a “power user” UI. As a result, people give up. Or worse: they ask people like you and I to do it for them.</p>

<p>I want to make the case to you that you can (and should) solve this kind of problem in a single evening.</p>

<p>Take the example of <a href="https://danieldelaney.net/magicbrake/">Magicbrake</a>, a simple front end I built. It hides the power and flexibility of Handbrake. It does only <em>the one thing</em> most people need Handbrake for: taking a weird video file and making it normal. (Normal, for our purposes, means a small MP4 that works just about anywhere.)</p>

<p>There is exactly one button.</p>



<p>This is a fast and uncomplicated thing to do. Unfortunately, the people who have the ability to solve problems like this are often disinclined to do it.</p>

<p>“Why would you make Handbrake less powerful on purpose?”</p>

<p>“What if someone wants a different format?”</p>

<p>“What about [feature/edge case]?”</p>

<p>The answer to all these questions is the same: a person who needs or wants that stuff can use Handbrake. If they don’t need everything Handbrake can do and find it bewildering, they can use this. Everyone wins.</p>

<p>It’s a bit like obscuring the less-used functions on a TV remote with tape. The functions still exist if you need them, but you’re not required to contend with them just to turn the TV on.</p>



<p>People benefit from stuff like this, and I challenge you to make more of it. Opportunities are everywhere. The world is full of media servers normal people can’t set up. Free audio editing software that requires hours of learning to be useful for simple tasks. Network monitoring tools that seem designed to ward off the uninitiated. Great stuff normal people don’t use. All because there’s only one UI, and it’s designed to do <em>everything.</em></p>

<p>80% of the people only need 20% of the features. Hide the rest from them and you’ll make them more productive and happy. That’s really all it takes.</p>

Ventoy is an open source tool to create bootable USB drive for ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI files. 
With ventoy, you don't need to format the disk over and over, just copy the image files to the USB drive and boot them.   
You can copy many image files at a time and ventoy will give you a boot menu to select them.  
You can also browse ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI files in local disk and boot them.
x86 Legacy BIOS, IA32 UEFI, x86_64 UEFI, ARM64 UEFI and MIPS64EL UEFI are supported in the same way.
Both MBR and GPT partition style are supported in the same way.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><p> More than 70 countries signed the landmark <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/cybercrime/convention/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.N. Convention against Cybercrime</a> in Hanoi this weekend, a significant step in the yearslong effort to create a global mechanism to counteract digital crime. </p><p> The U.K. and European Union joined China, Russia, Brazil, Nigeria and dozens of other nations in signing the convention, which lays out new mechanisms for governments to coordinate, build capacity and track those who use technology to commit crimes.&nbsp; </p><p> In his speech at the event, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said cyberspace “has become fertile ground for criminals” and has allowed them to “defraud families, steal livelihoods, and drain billions of dollars from our economies.” </p><p> “The UN Cybercrime Convention is a powerful, legally binding instrument to strengthen our collective defences against cybercrime,” Guterres <a href="https://webtv.un.org/en/asset/k1m/k1mmr6e30l?fbclid=IwY2xjawNsbKBleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFEaEJoeEdZVm5jOHFrbUZwAR6naDVwPBo0PIG40vUDzWufVp-JMZnPlhXObSoo82Td1voIWEEcVPyLc4VCqw_aem_BZcBFnBsiMKuxTexgtKUBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>.&nbsp; </p><p> “Illicit flows of money, concealed through cryptocurrencies and digital transactions, finance the trafficking of drugs, arms, and terror. And businesses, hospitals, and airports are brought to a standstill by ransomware attacks.” </p><p> He added that the convention would be critical for governments in the Global South that need assistance and funding for the training required to address cybercrime — which the U.N. estimates costs $10.5 trillion around the world annually.&nbsp; </p><p> While many countries did not sign the treaty, the most notable missing signature was that of the U.S. </p><p> Officials at the State Department <a href="https://therecord.media/cybercrime-treaty-signing-hanoi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told Recorded Future News on Friday</a> that Marc Knapper, the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, and representatives from the U.S. Mission to Vietnam would be attending the signing.&nbsp; </p><p> The State Department confirmed on Monday that the U.S. did not sign the treaty.&nbsp; </p><p> “The United States continues to review the treaty,” a State Department spokesperson said in a brief statement.&nbsp; </p><p> The U.N. Convention against Cybercrime was adopted by the General Assembly <a href="https://therecord.media/un-general-assembly-approves-cybercrime-treaty-despite-industry-pushback" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in December 2024</a> and will enter into force 90 days after being ratified by the 40th signatory. Signatories will have to ratify the convention according to their own procedures.&nbsp; </p><p> At the ceremony, UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly argued that cybercrime is changing the face of organized crime and required global coordination to address. Waly said the convention would be a “vital tool” that will ensure “a safer digital world for all.” </p><p> U.N. officials said the convention would help governments address terrorism, human trafficking, money laundering and drug smuggling, all of which have been turbo-charged by the internet.&nbsp; </p><p> The U.N. noted that the convention is the first global framework “for the collection, sharing and use of electronic evidence for all serious offenses” — noting that until now there have been no broadly accepted international standards on electronic evidence.&nbsp; </p><p> It is also the first global treaty to criminalize crimes that depend on the internet and is the first international treaty “to recognize the non-consensual dissemination of intimate images as an offense.” </p><p> “It creates the first global 24/7 network where countries can quickly initiate cooperation,” the U.N. said. “It recognizes and promotes the need to build capacity in countries to pursue and cooperate on fast-moving cybercrimes.” </p><p> The convention has been heavily criticized by the tech industry, which has warned that it criminalizes cybersecurity research and exposes companies to legally thorny data requests. </p><p> Human rights groups warned on Friday that it effectively forces member states to create a broad electronic surveillance dragnet that would include crimes that have nothing to do with technology.&nbsp; </p><p> Many expressed concern that the convention will be abused by dictatorships and rogue governments who will deploy it against critics or protesters — even those outside of a regime’s jurisdiction.&nbsp; </p><p> It also creates legal regimes to monitor, store and allow cross-border sharing of information without specific data protections. Access Now’s Raman Jit Singh Chima said the convention effectively justifies “cyber authoritarianism at home and transnational repression across borders.”&nbsp; </p><p> Any countries ratifying the treaty, he added, risks “actively validating cyber authoritarianism and facilitating the global erosion of digital freedoms, choosing procedural consensus over substantive human rights protection.” </p><p> In his speech, Guterres referenced the backlash to the convention, telling member states that the treaty has to be a “promise that fundamental human rights such as privacy, dignity, and safety must be protected both offline and online.”&nbsp; </p><p> But at its core, according to Guterres, the convention solves one of the thorniest issues law enforcement agencies have faced over the last two decades. Countries have only recently begun to share digital evidence across borders but the convention would increase that practice.&nbsp; </p><p> “This has long been a major obstacle to justice — with perpetrators in one country, victims in another, and data stored in a third,” he said. “The Convention provides a clear pathway for investigators and prosecutors to finally overcome this barrier.” </p></span></p><div><div><p>Get more insights with the </p><p>Recorded Future</p><p>Intelligence Cloud.</p></div><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform?mtm_campaign=ad-unit-record">Learn more.</a></p></div><div><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/?utm_source=therecord&amp;utm_medium=ad" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><figure><img alt="Recorded Future" fetchpriority="high" width="1000" height="500" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://cms.therecord.media/uploads/format_webp/2025_0514_Record_Ads_970x250_1_d144dbf901.png"></figure></a></div><div><p><span>Tags</span></p><ul><li><a href="https://therecord.media/tag/united-nations">United Nations</a></li><li><a href="https://therecord.media/tag/un-cybercrime-treaty">UN Cybercrime Treaty</a></li><li><a href="https://therecord.media/tag/cybercrime">Cybercrime</a></li></ul></div><div><p><span>No previous article</span></p><p><span>No new articles</span></p></div><div><p><a href="https://therecord.media/author/jonathan-greig"><img alt="Jonathan Greig" fetchpriority="auto" loading="lazy" width="384" height="384" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://cms.therecord.media/uploads/format_webp/DSC_0283_1_a6f4e4e315.jpg"></a></p><div><figcaption><a href="https://therecord.media/author/jonathan-greig"><p>Jonathan Greig</p></a><p><span><p>is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

        <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) wants to become independent of technology from the USA – for fear of reprisals from Donald Trump, Handelsblatt has learned. The institution in The Hague wants to replace the Microsoft software currently used on workstations with OpenDesk.</p>
<!-- RSPEAK_STOP -->




  


<!-- RSPEAK_START -->

<p>According to <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/technik/it-internet/software-strafgerichtshof-ersetzt-microsoft-durch-deutsche-loesung/100166382.html" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Handelsblatt</a>, the decision is to be seen against the backdrop of sanctions by the current US administration under President Donald Trump against employees such as Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan. <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Strafgerichtshof-Microsofts-E-Mail-Sperre-als-Weckruf-fuer-digitale-Souveraenitaet-10387368.html?from-en=1">Microsoft simply blocked his email access</a>. He therefore had to switch to the Swiss email service Proton. Since the ICC is highly dependent on service providers like Microsoft, its work is being paralyzed, it was stated in May.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the US government in Washington is examining further measures against the International Criminal Court, Handelsblatt further reports. This could also significantly restrict the institution's ability to work.</p>
<h3 id="nav_achieving__0">Achieving Digital Sovereignty</h3>
<p>The OpenDesk software is developed by the Center for Digital Sovereignty (Zendis), a federal company. Its task is to help resolve critical dependencies on individual technology providers.</p>
<!-- RSPEAK_STOP -->

  




<!-- RSPEAK_START -->

<p>At the International Criminal Court, it's “only” about 1800 workstations that are to be freed from US dependency. However, Handelsblatt sees this as an indication that geopolitics is increasingly revolving around technology. Businesses and politicians recognize the dependence on US digital corporations as a problem, especially regarding the fact that the USA uses technology as a means of pressure.</p>
<p>The ICC is not alone in these ambitions. For example, the <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Souveraenitaet-Oeffentlicher-Gesundheitsdienst-setzt-verstaerkt-auf-Open-Source-10443399.html?from-en=1">Public Health Service wants to use OpenDesk</a>, and the <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Rahmenvertrag-MS-365-Alternative-OpenDesk-soll-die-Bundeswehr-erobern-10342327.html?from-en=1">German Armed Forces has a framework agreement with Zendis</a> has concluded a framework agreement on “sovereign communication and collaboration solutions” such as OpenDesk.</p>

<p>One thing that <strong>school doesn’t teach you</strong> (not even high school) is <strong>how to manage your personal finances</strong>.</p>

<p>As my eldest son’s birthday was approaching, we suggested that instead of asking for physical gifts, he ask for their equivalent in money. That way, he gathered a <strong>decent amount of capital for his first investment adventure.</strong></p>

<p>I explained to my kids that <strong>investing is like having a magic box</strong> that generates more money over time. To make it more visual and interactive, I decided to create a small app where they could <strong>see their investment grow day by day</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="from-idea-to-app">From Idea to App</h2>

<p>My first idea was to build a <strong>physical piggy bank with a display</strong>, showing the accumulated amount. However, that mixed up the concept of <strong>saving</strong> with <strong>investing</strong>, and also required buying extra hardware.</p>

<p>So I looked for a quicker, cheaper way: <strong>revive an old smartphone</strong> and create a simple app using plain HTML.</p>

<p>The result was <strong>D-i<del>n</del>vestments</strong>, a mix between <em>Diversions</em> and <em>Investments</em>.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

<p>The app is essentially <strong>a single HTML file</strong> that installs on the phone as a <strong>PWA (Progressive Web App)</strong>.</p>

<p>The phone is <strong>attached to the fridge</strong> and works as a <strong>panel or dashboard</strong> where my kids can see <strong>their money growing each day.</strong></p>

<p>I act as their <strong>investment agent</strong>, assigning <strong>realistic interest rates</strong> — high enough to keep them motivated, but moderate enough to reflect how the real world works.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="configuration-screen">Configuration Screen</h2>

<p>The app includes a screen where you can enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The kids’ names</li>
  <li>The invested amount</li>
  <li>The interest rate</li>
  <li>The start date</li>
</ul>

        <p><img src="https://roberdam.com/assets/images/pantacel1.jpg" alt="Configuration screen"></p><p>Configuration screen</p>

<p>With that data, the app automatically calculates and displays:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Daily gain</strong></li>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Transformer components such as non-linear activations and normalization are inherently non-injective, suggesting that different inputs could map to the same output and prevent exact recovery of the input from a model's representations. In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove mathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input sequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are injective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and observe no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce SipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact input text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and demonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes injectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with direct implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.

<b>"server"</b> components and <b>"client"</b>
components. Server components don't have <code>useState</code>, <code>useEffect</code>, but can be
<code>async function</code>s and refer to backend tools like directly calling into a
database. Client components are the existing
model, where there is code on the backend to generate HTML text and frontend
code to manage the DOM using <code>window.document.*</code>.</p><blockquote>
<p>The first disaster: naming!! React is now using the words
<b>"server"</b> and <b>"client"</b> to refer to
a very specific things, ignoring their existing definitions. This would be
fine, except <b>Client</b> components can run on the backend
too! In this article, I'll be using the terms <b>"backend"</b> and
<b>"frontend"</b> to describe the two execution environments that web apps
exist in: a Node.js process and a Web browser, respectively.</p>
</blockquote><p>This <b>Server</b>/<b>Client</b> component model
is interesting. Since built-ins like <code>&lt;Suspense /&gt;</code> get serialized across the
network, data fetching can be very trivially modeled with async <b>server components</b>, and the fallback UI works as if it were
client-side.</p><figure><figcaption>src/app/[username]/page.tsx</figcaption><pre><code><span>// For this article, server components will be highlighted in red

    <span>// The components `UserInfo` and `UserPostList` will be run at the same
    // time. Once `UserInfo` is ready, the visitor will see the page with a
    // `PostListSkeleton` if the post list is not yet ready.

has zero JavaScript for the UI and data fetching — it just streams the
markup! For example, the imagined markdown parser within the <code>&lt;Markdown /&gt;</code>
component stays on the backend. When an interactive frontend is needed, <b>Client
components</b> can be created by putting them in a file starting with <code>"use client"</code>.</p><figure><figcaption>src/components/CopyButton.tsx</figcaption><pre><code><span>"use client"</span>; <span>// This comment marks the file for client-side bundling.

front lines: a Next.js app with a Hono backend. The following notes are
simplifications from the real world problems I've encountered when trying to
maintain and develop new features. As a result of all of these, everyone's time
is wasted either working around design flaws, or explaining to each other why
what should be a non-issue is an immovable object.</p><h3 id="optimistic-updates"><a href="#toc">§</a>Optimistic Updates are Impossible</h3><p>The Next.js documentation for performing mutations <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/updating-data">does not mention optimistic
updates</a>; it appears this case was not thought about.
Components rendered by the <b>React Server</b>, by design, can
not be modified after mounting. Elements that could change need to be inside a
client component, but data fetching cannot happen on the client components,
even during SSR on the backend. This results in awkwardly small server
components that only do data fetching and then have a client component that
contains a mostly-static version of the page.</p><figure><figcaption>src/app/user/[username]/page.tsx</figcaption><pre><code><span>export default async function </span><span>Page</span><span>() </span>{

</code></pre></figure><p>As more of the page needs interactivity, it gets messier trying to keep the
static parts truly server-side. On the work app, nearly every piece of UI
displays some dynamic data. A <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API"><code>WebSocket</code></a> synchronizes data live as it
updates (for example, a user card's online state along with their basic
profile). Since these component setups are harder to understand and maintain
for engineers, almost all of our pages are entirely <code>"use client"</code> with a
<code>page.tsx</code> that defines the data fetching.</p><p>A more concrete example of what this looks like in practice with the
data-fetching library we use at work, <a href="https://github.com/tanstack/query#readme">TanStack Query</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>src/queries/users.ts</figcaption><pre><code><span>// At work, there is a helper function `defineQuery` for type safety.

    <span>&lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;</span>;
}
</code></pre></figure><p>This example has to be three separate files because of the rules of server
component bundling. (The client component needs <code>"use client"</code>, and server
component files often can't be imported on the client due to server-only
imports.). In the Pages router, this could've been a single file because of the
tree-shaking that <code>getStaticProps</code> and <code>getServerSideProps</code> has.</p><h3 id="redundant-fetches"><a href="#toc">§</a>Every Navigation is Another Fetch</h3><p>Since the App Router starts every page as a server component, with (ideally)
small areas of interactivity, a navigation to a new page <em>has</em> to fetch the
Next.js server, regardless of what data the client already has available! Even
with a a <code>loading.tsx</code> file, opening <code>/</code>, navigating to <code>/other</code>, and then
going back to <code>/</code> will show the loading state while it re-fetches the homepage.</p><p>The only case this works is for <strong>perfectly static content</strong>, where instant
navigations and prefetching work great. But <strong>web apps are not static</strong>, they
have lots of dynamic content. Being logged in affects the homepage, which is
infuriating because the client literally has everything needed to display the
page instantly. It's not like the cookies changed.</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>aside</strong>: In further testing on a blank project, I observe cases where the
Next frontend code would pre-fetch routes, but <strong>without any real contents</strong>.
On the hello world example, this was a 1.8kB RSC payload that pointed to 2
different JS chunks 4 separate times. This is just pure waste of our
bandwidth and egress, especially considering all of this information is
re-fetched when I actually click the link.</p>

<p>In review, I found there is actually some content in here: the loading state.
Do you see it?</p>
<figure><pre><code>[<span>"$"</span>,<span>"div"</span>,<span>"l"</span>,{<span>"children"</span>:<span>"loading..."</span>}]
</code></pre></figure>
<p>It's still a lot of waste, since all of this data gets re-emitted in the
actual page RSC.</p>
</blockquote><p>The solution to this appears to be <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/staleTimes"><code>staleTime</code></a>, but it's marked
experimental and "not recommended for production".  The fact this is a
non-default afterthought configuration option is embarassing. Even if we used
it, you cannot make multiple pages that refer to the same underlying data share
any of it.</p><p>One form of loading state that cannot be represented with the App Router is
having a page such as a page like a git project's issue page, and clicking on a
user name to navigate to their profile page. With <code>loading.tsx</code>, the entire
page is a skeleton, but when modeling these queries with TanStack Query it is
possible to show the username and avatar instantly while the user's bio and
repositories are fetched in. Server components don't support this form of
navigation because the data is only available in rendered components, so it
must be re-fetched.</p><p>In our Next.js site, we have this line of code on our server component data
fetchers to make soft navigations faster by skipping the data fetch phase all
together.</p><figure><figcaption>src/util/tanstack-query-helpers.server.ts</figcaption><pre><code><span>export function </span><span>serverSidePrefetchQueries</span><span>(queries) </span>{

        <span>// This is a soft-navigation. SKIP the prefetching to make it faster.
        // The client might already have this data, and if not, they have the
        // loading state. Ideally, this server request wouldn't exist -- The
        // client side has nearly ALL the code since the app is written mostly
        // as client components. Kind of a design flaw of the App router TBH.
        </span><span>return</span>;
    }
    <span>// ... data prefetching-logic ...
</span>}
</code></pre></figure><p>In addition to this, <code>loading.tsx</code> should contain the <code>useQuery</code> calls so that
while the network request for the empty RSC happens, the data is being fetched
if it actually is needed. In fact, the <code>loading.tsx</code> state can just be the
actual client component, and you'll see the client page.</p><figure><figcaption>src/app/user/[username]/loading.tsx</figcaption><pre><code><span>"use client"</span>;

}
</code></pre></figure><blockquote>
<p>At work, we just make our <code>loading.tsx</code> files contain the <code>useQuery</code>
calls and show a skeleton. This is because when Next.js loads the actual Server
Component, no matter what, the entire page re-mounts. No VDOM diffing here,
meaning all hooks (<code>useState</code>) will reset slightly after the request
completes. I tried to reproduce a simple case where I was <em>begging</em> Next.js to
just <em>update the existing DOM</em> and preserve state, but it just doesn't.
Thankfully, the time the blank RSC call takes is short enough.</p>
</blockquote><h3 id="layout-restrictions"><a href="#toc">§</a>Layouts are Artificially Restricted</h3><p>Layouts can perform data fetching, but they can't observe or alter the request
in any way. This is done so that Next.js can fetch and cache layouts whenever they
want. In every other framework, layouts are just regular components that have
no feature difference compared to page components.</p><p>Fetching layouts in isolation is a cute idea, but it ends up being silly
because it also means that any data fetching has to be re-done per layout. You
can't share a <code>QueryClient</code>; instead, you must rely on their <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch">monkey-patched
<code>fetch</code></a> to cache the same <code>GET</code> request like they promise.</p><p>When a coworker asks me about why Next.js rejects some code, I've given up on
explaining the technical intricacies and just say <em>"It's a Next.js Skill Issue,
I'm going to blow it up soon don't worry."</em> These rules are too hard for normal
developers to understand.</p><h3 id="rsc-payload"><a href="#toc">§</a>You Still Download All the Content Twice</h3><p>Unlike the <a href="https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/islands-architecture/">"Islands Architecture"</a>, Server Components still have to
be hydrated on the frontend to support <code>Suspense</code> and preserving client
component state. When doing soft navigations, the "RSC Payload" (which is not
HTML at all) is retrieved by <code>fetch</code>. On a fresh reload, HTML is needed for the
<a href="https://web.dev/articles/fcp">first paint</a>, but the information about Client components and <code>Suspense</code> is
not contained within that HTML. React's solution is to <strong>send a second copy of
the entire page's markup</strong>. An example of what a Next.js production server
would send in a dynamic page render would be something like this:</p><figure><figcaption>GET /user/clover</figcaption><pre><code><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
</span><span>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
</span>    {link and meta tags}
<span>&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
</span>    {server side render}
    <span>&lt;script&gt;
        </span><span>// a bootstrap script that sets up global `__next_f` as
        // an array. once React loads, this `.push` function
        // gets overwritten to write new chunks directly to the
        // RSC decoder. this script has some dom helpers too
        </span>(<span>self</span>.<span>__next_f</span><span>=</span><span>self</span>.<span>__next_f</span><span>||</span>[]).<span>push</span>([<span>0</span>])
    <span>&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        </span><span>// the RSC payload for the application shell.
        </span><span>self</span>.<span>__next_f</span>.<span>push</span>([<span>1</span>,<span>"1:\"$Sreact.fragment\"\n2:I[658993,[\"/_next/st{...}"</span>])
    <span>&lt;/script&gt;

    </span><span>&lt;!--
        the closing &lt;/body&gt; is NOT written yet, since there is a
        suspense boundary not resolved. time passes, and only
        then is more data is written
    --&gt;
    </span><span>&lt;div class="user-post-list"&gt;
</span>        {server side render of a Suspense boundary}
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        </span><span>// the RSC payload for the suspense boundary
        </span><span>self</span>.<span>__next_f</span>.<span>push</span>([<span>2</span>,<span>"14:[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"h4\"{...}"</span>])
    <span>&lt;/script&gt;
    
    </span><span>&lt;!-- HTML and script tags repeat until the entire page is done --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</span></code></pre></figure><p>This solution <strong>doubles the size of the initial HTML payload</strong>. Except it's
worse, because the RSC payload includes JSON quoted in JS string literals, which
format is much less efficient than HTML. While it seems to compress fine
with brotli and render fast in the browser, this is wasteful. With the
hydration pattern, at least the data locally could be re-used for interactivity
and other pages.</p><p>Even on pages that have little to no interactivity, you pay the cost. To use
the Next.js documentation as an example, loading <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs">its
homepage</a> loads an page that is around 750kB (250kB of
HTML and the 500kB of script tags), and content is in there twice.</p><p>You can verify that by pressing <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Opt</kbd> + <kbd>u</kbd>
on Mac or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>u</kbd> on other platforms. And then
<kbd>Cmd</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>f</kbd> to locate any string of the
blog, such as "building full-stack web applications". It's there twice. And
<strong>there is no way around this</strong>, since it's a fundamental piece of React Server
Components.</p><p>This RSC format certainly has more waste. But I really don't feel like digging into
why the string <code>/_next/static/chunks/6192a3719cda7dcc.js</code> appears 27 separate
times. What the hell, guys? Is your bandwidth free???</p><h3 id="turbopack"><a href="#toc">§</a>Turbopack Sucks</h3><p>This section is not constructive.</p><ul>

    };
});
</code></pre></figure><p>Then, I looked for every usage of a Next.js API, and either removed it or made
a stub for TanStack. For example, <code>src/tanstack-next/link.tsx</code> implements
<code>next/link</code>:</p><figure><figcaption>src/tanstack-next/link.tsx</figcaption><pre><code><span>import </span>{ <span>Link </span>} <span>from </span><span>"@tanstack/react-router"</span>;
<span>import type </span>{ <span>LinkProps </span>} <span>from </span><span>"next/link"</span>;

<span>export default function </span><span>LinkAdapter</span><span>({ href, </span><span>...</span><span>rest }</span><span>: </span><span>LinkProps</span><span>) </span>{

}
</code></pre></figure><blockquote>
<p>Some of these stubs can be extremely simple. Starting out, my implementation
of <code>useRouter</code> was just <code>return {}</code>, but later I had to add a couple methods
to the object. The code here doesn't have to be clean, because it is
temporary.</p>
</blockquote><p>Now, the new site can import nearly every client component by either stubbing
out the Next.js APIs it needs, or by using the <code>.tanstack.ts</code> extension to
re-implement logic on a file-by-file basis. And shortly after, I got the site's
homepage to work in TanStack Start, and we merged the branch.</p><p><img src="https://paperclover.net/file/2025/blog-everyone-hates-nextjs/pr.png" alt="My &quot;nextgate&quot; PR"></p><blockquote>
<p>This first PR only supported one of our pages, and was able to do it in a
thousand lines of added code, and 40 lines deleted. I had previous patches to
remove the few uses of <code>next/image</code> and <code>next/font</code>.</p>
</blockquote><p>What was left was porting every other route over. The one thing we lose in
migrating from Next.js to any other framework is the ability to <code>await</code>
data-fetching functions in the UI. In practice, moving every route into a
<code>loader</code> function made it much more clear what happened when a page was SSR'd.
For pages that had multiple fetches, these could be combined into a single,
special API call that would return all of the relevant data for that page.</p><p>To re-iterate in bold font: <strong>The
migration path from Server Components is to just simplify your code — RSC
inherently drives you down a chaotic road of things you do not need</strong>.
Nearly every complex part of our site got easier to understand for all
engineers. The exception to this was having everyone get used to the new file
system routing conventions. With enough examples, we all got the hang of it.</p><p>With the incremental migration in place, new code did not break the existing
deployment. TanStack slowly took over the codebase, and we eventually deleted
all of the Next.js stubs and gained all of the beautiful <a href="https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/guide/type-safety">type-safety features</a>
that the TanStack Router provides. At the end, the site performed faster from
every angle: Development Mode, Production page load times, Soft navigations,
and at a lower price than our Next depoyment with Vercel.</p><p>We're not the only ones seeing the change. While I try and keep myself off of
social media, someone sent me <a href="https://twitter.com/BriansAngles/status/1978834116079436242#m">the results of Brian Anglin's work at

place in our code where moving to TanStack made things harder to do. Instead of
worsening the code, I just ported their metadata API into a regular function,
so everyone can use it. Originally, I had a 1:1 port on NPM, but earlier this
year I simplified it's API into one short and understandable
file. As of this blog post, I have added a TanStack-compatible

forget exactly who I talked to, but the big people were all in on this. I,
having implemented the bundler end of RSC, saw a couple of the problems in the
format. With Next 15 "stabilizing" the App Router last year, many companies are
building their products on it, realizing these pitfalls first-hand.</p><p>I came into the Next.js game late, only starting in June with version 15.
But everyone I've talked to at events sympathize with my notes. All the people
I talked to on the subject at Bun's 1.3 Party agreed with me. Even some people
at Vercel told me they don't like how Next.js is to actually use.</p><p>I hope as TanStack Start stabilizes, it becomes the Next.js replacement everyone
wants.</p><p>A lot of in the JavaScript ecosystem is a mess. That mess is why web
development gets made fun of. There were a lot of times I thought that working
with the web was an unrecoverable mess, but the mess was actually just the
commonly-used libraries I surrounded myself with. When that is peeled back,
modern web development technologies are awesome.</p><p>I've been making this website from scratch without any framework since late
2024, by writing systems like my own <a href="https://git.paperclover.net/clo/sitegen/src/branch/master/lib/progress.ts">TUI progress widget</a>, <a href="https://git.paperclover.net/clo/sitegen/src/branch/master/src/file-viewer/cache.ts">static
file proxy</a>, incremental build system, and many more components.
Working on this code has produced some of my best coding sessions (by
happiness) in years. The viewers of <em><a href="https://paperclover.net/">paper clover</a></em> get a better quality
website; the mini-libraries I create get <a href="https://git.paperclover.net/clo/sitegen/src/branch/master/lib#readme">extracted for public use</a>,
everyone wins.</p><p>This level of from-scratch is too much for most people, especially at the
workplace. I say that at the minimum, we should only give our attention and
money to high quality tools that respect us. And Next.js and the company behind
it, Vercel, are not that.</p><p>If you use Next.js, and feel that the experience doesn't remind you of respect
too, consider whether you and your colleagues want to continue supporting their
<a href="https://youtu.be/SCIfWhAheVw">serverless empire</a>. The Vite ecosystem seems pretty decent to build on right
now, but I still have little experience in using their tools at scale in
production. The <a href="https://viteplus.dev/">Vite+ launch from Void0</a> seems interesting, but
only time will tell if these venture-funded tools will respect us (end-users
and developers) long term.</p><p>Next.js Conf 2025, as of writing, is <a href="https://nextjs.org/conf">tomorrow</a>. Instead of
purchasing a $800 ticket, I decided to put that money <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/tannerlinsley">toward the TanStack
team</a> for <a href="https://tanstack.com/ethos">respecting and improving the web development
ecosystem</a>.</p><h2>What the Future Holds</h2><p>Slowly, I've been replacing many pieces of software that disrespect me with
better alternatives. Some examples of this are GitHub, Visual Studio Code,
DaVinci Resolve, Discord, Google Drive/Workspace, along many more. I plan to
write more on this blog about the technical things I do (that progress library,
the purpose of my own site generator, learnings from my current job), including
some of my past projects at Bun (details on HMR, the crash reporter, and the
crazy system for bundling built-in modules). If it interests you, please

<h2>IRCd service</h2>
<h2>10.6.2024</h2>
Ok. We have IRC at example.fi<p>

Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a form of real-time text communication developed by Jarkko Oikarinen in 1988. Initially created to replace a local BBS system at the University of Oulu in Finland, IRC quickly gained global popularity, becoming a foundational technology for online chat communities and influencing the development of modern instant messaging and social media platforms. Its significance lies in its pioneering role in connecting people across the internet, fostering early online communities, and setting the stage for contemporary digital communication.
</p><p>
To commemorate this pivotal technology, example.fi provides a simple and limited IRC server. This server is uniquely written in AWK, a scripting language traditionally used for text processing, highlighting the adaptability and enduring legacy of IRC. This creative implementation serves as both an educational tool and a tribute to the foundational role of IRC in the evolution of online communication.
</p><p>
In the following picture you see Irssi in the background and Hexchat on top of it:</p><p>
<img src="https://example.fi/blog/example-irc.png"></p><p>

Note: if you plan to connect to example.fi, make sure you do not use any fancy features. In irssi, use -nocap option. In Windows, use for example hexchat.
As this is written in gawk, most IRC protocol features are not implemented. This includes, for example, channel and user listings, topics, the concept of "operator" etc.
Technical fun fact: Total code count is around 60 lines of awk and a few lines of bash.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <article>   <p>Since the beginning of the Fall 2025 anime season, a major change has started taking place at the anime streaming service <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crunchyroll" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Crunchyroll</a>: <strong>the presentation quality for translations of on-screen text has taken a total nosedive</strong> compared to what has been on offer for many years, all the way up until the previous Summer 2025 season. Now, more and more subtitles on Crunchyroll are looking like this:</p>

<p>Poor presentation quality like this isn’t entirely new to Crunchyroll, as a portion of the subtitles on the site have always been of third-party origin — that is, provided by the licensor — and Crunchyroll just puts them up with zero oversight. This in itself has caused <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-07-01/crunchyroll-german-necronomico-and-the-cosmic-horror-show-subtitles-listed-chatgpt/.226206" rel="noopener" target="_blank">numerous</a> <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2023-10-05/the-yuzuki-family-four-sons-episode-1-briefly-inaccessible-on-crunchyroll-after-subtitle-quality-/.203183" rel="noopener" target="_blank">issues</a> over the years, but the pressing issue here is that <strong>low quality presentation like this can now be found even in first-party subtitles created by Crunchyroll’s own subtitling staff.</strong> For comparison, here’s the kind of presentation quality that first-party subtitles were providing just earlier this year:</p>

<p>Given the technical capabilities on display in the above screenshots, it should be clear that <strong>first-party subtitles for Fall 2025 shows shouldn’t look as bad as they do.</strong> Yet for some reason, what we’re getting is this low quality presentation reminiscent of third-party subtitles, where translations for dialogue and on-screen text aren’t even separated to different sides of the screen – everything is just bunched up together at either the top or the bottom. Lots of on-screen text is even left straight up untranslated.</p>

<h2 id="and-thats-destroying-subtitles">And that’s “destroying subtitles”?</h2>
<p>It sure is when it’s anime we’re talking about! <strong>Anime as a medium has made prominent use of on-screen text basically since its inception.</strong> The amount of it varies from series to series, but almost every anime out there makes use of on-screen text at one point or another, with some featuring downright ridiculous amounts of <b>signs</b> (what on-screen text is called for short). With all this on-screen text, it is also very common for there to be text visible on the screen potentially in multiple positions, even when characters are speaking.</p>
<p>As such, <strong>if you are in the business of localizing anime for non-Japanese audiences, you need to be able to deal with on-screen text.</strong> At bare minimum, when subtitling anime, you should be able to do <b>overlaps</b> (multiple lines of text on the screen at the same time) and <b>positioning</b> (the ability to freely place subtitles anywhere on the screen). Anything less and you are likely to run into trouble the moment you get to something as simple as a next episode preview:</p>
<figure id="typesetting-introduction" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""> <a href="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/saki-s3-fansub-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><img src="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/saki-s3-fansub-1.jpg" alt="A screenshot from a next episode preview. It features a static sign saying 'Next episode preview' on top left, a similar sign for the title of the next episode on the bottom right, and you have dialogue running through the whole preview while these signs are visible, meaning you need at least three overlaps and positioning to handle it gracefully." loading="lazy" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""></a> <figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><p>Multiple instances of on-screen text are running in parallel with dialogue. Screenshot from <em>Saki: The Nationals</em> (Winter&nbsp;2014, Underwater-FFF fansubs)</p></figcaption>  </figure>
<p>Overlaps and positioning are really just the bare necessities for dealing with on-screen text in anime though – ideally, you should also be able to use different fonts, colors, animate text in various ways, etc. Making use of all these possibilities is an art unto itself, and <strong>this art of on-screen text localization is commonly referred to as typesetting</strong>. Typesetting is important even when dubbing anime, as all that on-screen text is going to be there in the video all the same!</p>
<h2 id="so-why-would-crunchyroll-get-rid-of-typesetting">So why would Crunchyroll get rid of typesetting?</h2>
<p>That is a good question. It is no exaggeration to say that up to this point, Crunchyroll with its typesetting was the unambiguous market leader when it came to presentation quality for official anime subtitles… though for the most part, <strong>other services dealing in anime have never even bothered to try.</strong> Sentai Filmworks’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidive" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hidive</a> is just about the only other anime service that even attempts to do typesetting, though they license so few shows per season that they are a tiny player compared to the Big Boys of anime streaming.</p>


<p>And it is very likely the existence of these Big Boys that has played a key part in Crunchyroll’s eradication of its typesetting. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amazon Prime Video</a> probably need no introduction to anyone reading this – both are very popular general streaming services. <strong>Despite anime being only a minor part of their catalogs, a large chunk of today’s anime watching worldwide happens through said services</strong> thanks to their sheer user counts alone.</p>
<p>Crunchyroll clearly seems to know this, which is why it has been sublicensing its anime properties to both Amazon and Netflix for multiple years at this point. <strong>But with such sublicensing comes the matter of dealing with the subtitling standards of general streaming services.</strong> I’m not going to mince words: these standards are <em>awful,</em> at least as far as anime is concerned. Netflix for example insists that you stick to at most two lines of text on screen at once, which makes sense most of the time… if you’re talking about dialogue alone. Unfortunately, it becomes completely inadequate when dealing with anime’s plentiful on-screen text. Moreover, the standards of these services actively refuse to give you tools like positioning and overlaps, even though the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timed_Text_Markup_Language" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TTML subtitle format</a> they use supports said features!</p>

<p>With such typesetting-hostile standards to deal with, Crunchyroll had basically two choices for how to make sublicensing to Amazon and Netflix work with their existing subtitles that feature actual typesetting: Either 1) try to negotiate with the services for permission to make use of more TTML capabilities (that the subtitle renderers of said services should already support!) or 2) <strong>start mangling subtitles with typesetting into something compatible with the awful subtitling standards of the general streaming services.</strong> I am not aware if Crunchyroll ever attempted the former, but I can confirm that it eventually started doing the latter.</p>

<p>Editors among Crunchyroll’s subtitling staff were <strong>given an additional job</strong> to convert finished high quality subtitles with typesetting into limited low quality TTML subtitles without typesetting, compatible with Amazon &amp; Netflix subtitling standards. They got paid extra for the manual effort required by the process.</p>
<figure id="ttml-example" data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=""> <video poster="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/devilman-crybaby-netflix-1-poster.jpg" controls="" preload="metadata" data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=""> <source src="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/devilman-crybaby-netflix-1.mp4" type="video/mp4;codecs=avc1.640028,mp4a.40.2" data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=""> <span data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt="">It appears that your browser does not support playing this video.

Video clip from <em>Devilman Crybaby</em> (Winter&nbsp;2018, Netflix)</figcaption>  </figure>
<p>Unfortunately, after a couple years of this kind of manual conversion work, the Crunchyroll leadership seems to have decided that it isn’t enough, and that <strong>Crunchyroll must do away with high quality subtitles with typesetting entirely and only produce low quality TTML subtitles without typesetting from now on.</strong> But if they already had a working process for high quality subtitles at home and low quality TTML subtitles elsewhere, why would they just decide to give that up in order to produce exclusively low quality subtitles? It doesn’t seem to make very much sense, even as a cost-cutting measure. There should be so much value in being able to advertise <em>best viewed on Crunchyroll</em> to potential audiences for long-term growth, right?</p>
<p>To understand <em>how this is happening,</em> we need to look into some relevant history. <strong>Specifically, what happened after Sony bought Crunchyroll and merged it with Funimation,</strong> another US anime distributor that Sony had bought previously. But in order to also understand <em>why this is happening,</em> first we need to look at what both Crunchyroll and Funimation were like before this fateful merger happened, as well as how they approached anime subtitling over the years.</p>

<h2 id="a-short-history-of-crunchyroll-and-its-subtitling-standards">A short history of Crunchyroll and its subtitling standards</h2>
<p>Crunchyroll launched in 2006 as a pirate streaming site focused on East Asian media content, featuring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fansub" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fansubbed</a> anime, live action drama, music videos, and so on. There was nothing particularly remarkable about the site back then – as a rule of thumb, pirate streaming sites are always worse quality-wise than if you just directly downloaded the pirated releases they use as a base, and the sites mostly exist to make their admins illicit money through ads, begging for donations, and other shady crap. It is important to note though that <strong>legal anime streaming basically wasn’t a thing at this time.</strong></p>
<figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""> <a href="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/crunchyroll-in-2007.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><img src="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/crunchyroll-in-2007.png" alt="" loading="lazy" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""></a> <figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><p>Crunchyroll in 2007. The “help out” message at the top is asking for donations.</p></figcaption>  </figure>
<p>Things started to change in 2008, <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-03-21/gonzo-works-to-be-streamed-simultaneously-with-airing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">when the Japanese anime studio Gonzo started experimenting with legal internet distribution</a> for some of its titles. They struck deals with a couple companies for this, which is how Crunchyroll got its first few legitimate licenses. However, all the pirate material remained on the site while this was going on. Also in 2008: Crunchyroll managed to raise 4 million USD in venture capital funding while still operating as a pirate site, <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-03-12/funimation-responds-to-crunchyroll-us$4m-funding" rel="noopener" target="_blank">which drew vocal criticism</a> from existing anime distributors at the time (for obvious reasons).</p>
<p>However, it was likely this exact venture capital funding that enabled Crunchyroll to negotiate a major deal with the Japanese broadcasting company TV Tokyo, which was announced at the start of 2009. <strong>This announcement brought with it the news that Crunchyroll was going full-time legitimate and getting rid of all its pirate content.</strong> With this move, Crunchyroll found itself in a position of having to start producing subtitles of its own (instead of just uploading fansubs) and somehow present said subtitles to its customers.</p>
<figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""> <a href="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/aegisub.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><img src="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/aegisub.png" alt="" loading="lazy" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""></a> <figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><p>Aegisub is an advanced subtitling software built by fansubbers, for fansubbers.</p></figcaption>  </figure>
<p id="aegisub-ass-introduction">For the subtitle production part, Crunchyroll managed to strike a deal with a bunch of fansubbers to take on the job. This single decision was a fateful one, as it was the foundation for basically everything that came after – with former fansubbers on the job, the tools of the trade were set according to the standards of fansubbers: the subtitling software of choice was to be <a href="https://aegisub.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Aegisub</a>, and <strong>the subtitle format of choice was to be Aegisub’s native format, Advanced SubStation Alpha, or ASS for short.</strong></p>

<p>ASS is an extremely powerful format in terms of formatting and styling capabilities, and with Aegisub, it is easy to produce ASS subtitles that make use of said capabilities. <strong>However, as a streaming site, Crunchyroll needed to be able to present these ASS subtitles in the browser somehow,</strong> and the only full-fledged ASS renderers that existed were only available in the traditional local media playback environments targeted by fansubbers, which meant that Crunchyroll couldn’t make use of said renderers on the web directly.</p>
<p>Now, there are two main ways to subtitle videos, with opposing pros and cons:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Hardsubbing</b> – the subtitles are burned into the video itself. <strong>Simple to playback</strong> as you only need to be able to play video, <strong>but inflexible for updates and multiple languages</strong> as you have to recreate your video files over and over again with expensive processing called <b>encoding</b>.</li>
<li><b>Softsubbing</b> – the subtitles exist as their own separate media track that the video player renders on top of the video in realtime during playback, making softsubs <strong>complex to playback, but updates and multiple tracks are very cheap</strong> as you only need to deal with tiny subtitle files while the video files remain unchanged.</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, one way Crunchyroll could have solved the subtitle presentation problem would have been to simply hardsub its ASS subtitles, but despite the challenges it posed, Crunchyroll decided to go with softsubbing instead (which was also the fansub standard at the time). <strong>And so Crunchyroll set out to build its own ASS renderer in Flash,</strong> the primary technology used to play video on the web at the time. Here’s a screenshot of some of the first subtitles ever officially authored by the fully legitimate Crunchyroll, rendered in the current ASS renderer but adhering to the limits of the company’s very first Flash subtitle renderer:</p>
<figure id="cr-first-subs" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""> <a href="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/saki-cr-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><img src="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/saki-cr-1.jpg" alt="A screenshot from a next episode preview. It features a static sign saying 'Next episode preview' on top left, a similar sign for the title of the next episode on the bottom right, and you have dialogue running through the whole preview while these signs are visible, meaning you need at least three overlaps and positioning to handle it gracefully." loading="lazy" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""></a> <figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><p>Screenshot from <em>Saki</em> (Spring&nbsp;2009, Crunchyroll)</p></figcaption>  </figure>
<p>As can be seen, even the very first version was already capable of handling both overlaps and positioning. Now, the positioning was limited to the eight edges and the center of the screen, making for just nine possible positions total, but even that was enough to handle the humble next episode preview at the very least. Beyond these, the first version also supported fading animations. It wasn’t much, <strong>but it did cover the bare minimum for dealing with on-screen text in anime.</strong></p>

<p>Over the years, Crunchyroll managed to slowly improve its Flash subtitle renderer to enable the use of more ASS features. Custom colors, multiple fonts, multiple styles, rotation, and full positioning were implemented (albeit in somewhat hacky and unwieldy fashion). This went on until 2018, when Crunchyroll was faced with a major issue: <strong>Flash was seeing rapid decline in use, and web streaming was shifting over to HTML5-based technology.</strong> However, with a custom ASS renderer built in Flash, Crunchyroll couldn’t easily make the change, as it would mean having to essentially rebuild the custom subtitle renderer they had from scratch in HTML5 (as much like in the Flash days, there still were no solutions native to the web available for rendering ASS subtitles).</p>
<p id="cr-libass">However, Crunchyroll managed to come up with a way to solve the problem of moving from Flash to HTML5 with the help of another new web technology called <a href="https://webassembly.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WebAssembly</a>, which allowed developers to take code that wasn’t developed for the web and compile it for use on the web. With WebAssembly, Crunchyroll could take <a href="https://github.com/libass/libass" rel="noopener" target="_blank">libass</a>, one of the few fully-featured ASS renderers out there, and <a href="https://github.com/libass/JavascriptSubtitlesOctopus" rel="noopener" target="_blank">use it for their new HTML5 player</a>. Now, not only did all their old ASS subtitles render nicely in HTML5, but <strong>the possibilities for typesetting at Crunchyroll had taken a huge leap forward.</strong> And the subtitling staff at Crunchyroll was more than happy to make use of this newfound power.</p>
<figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=""> <video poster="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/bocchi-cr-1-poster.jpg" controls="" preload="metadata" data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=""> <source src="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/bocchi-cr-1.mp4" type="video/mp4;codecs=avc1.640028,mp4a.40.2" data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=""> <span data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt="">It appears that your browser does not support playing this video.

Video clip from <em>Bocchi the Rock!</em> (Fall&nbsp;2022, Crunchyroll)</figcaption>  </figure>
<p>That said, despite having a technically fully-featured ASS renderer to work with, <strong>there were still limitations.</strong> Code compiled with WebAssembly runs worse compared to its original native counterpart, which limits how heavy the typesetting can be (with the flexible features of ASS, it is very easy to produce typesetting that simply cannot be rendered in realtime even on powerful computers, resulting in notable lag during playback). A commercial service like Crunchyroll will also generally want to keep its content watchable even on lower-end devices, which further reduces how complex any typesetting can be.</p>
<p>And this is the limited but functional standard of typesetting that Crunchyroll users got to enjoy (with first-party subtitles) up until the fateful season of Fall 2025 that prompted the creation of this article.</p>
<p>Before we move to the conclusions for this section, though, it is worth noting that while Crunchyroll currently uses softsubbed ASS subtitles whenever it can, there are platforms and devices (like various TVs) where this kind of ASS rendering simply isn’t possible to do. <strong>Crunchyroll is available on some platforms like this, which means it has been making additional hardsubbed versions of everything on top of the usual softsubbed ones.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>So, what can we learn from all this? At least one thing is abundantly clear: for most of its existence, <strong>the leadership at Crunchyroll had at least some respect and understanding for anime as a medium.</strong> They understood that it was important to be able to deal with on-screen text in their subtitles, and allocated enough resources to make typesetting possible. The company even managed to improve in this regard over time, albeit very slowly.</p>
<p>That said, anyone familiar with anime fansubs of the 2010s and 2020s probably can’t help but feel disappointed that even the highest effort typesetting from Crunchyroll could only ever be on the level of fansub releases from around 2010 at best. Why 2010 specifically? <strong>Because from 2011 onwards, fansubbers started widely incorporating advanced motion tracking into their typesetting.</strong> Observe an example of such fansub typesetting from over a decade ago, the likes of which has never been seen on Crunchyroll:</p>
<figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=""> <video poster="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/klk-underwater-1-poster.jpg" controls="" preload="metadata" data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=""> <source src="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/klk-underwater-1.mp4" type="video/mp4;codecs=avc1.640028,mp4a.40.2" data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=""> <span data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt="">It appears that your browser does not support playing this video.

<p>Now, while fansubbers giving away their work for free might get away with saying <q>just get a better computer</q> to anyone whose devices can’t render softsubbed typesetting like this in realtime, an official service that lots of people pay for doesn’t really have the same luxury, which is the main reason why you don’t see stuff like this softsubbed on Crunchyroll. But this is not an insurmountable problem, so make no mistake: <strong>official anime services could absolutely offer typesetting with similar level of quality to the best of fansubs.</strong> The basic solution to the performance problem is very simple, even: you simply hardsub the typesetting. This would work from streaming to physical disc releases and only the sky would be the limit in terms of the typesetting quality you could offer, as realtime rendering would no longer be a concern!</p>
<p id="best-of-both-worlds">Now, as mentioned earlier, hardsubbing does make things more complicated and expensive on the backend as you need to encode and store multiple copies of video. Crunchyroll is already dealing with this, though! But if costs are an issue, the system is pretty easy to improve in theory: if you keep the dialogue softsubbed, only the parts of the video that actually feature typesetting would be hardsubbed, and with some clever engineering and an understanding of how modern media formats work, you would only have to keep multiple copies of the typeset parts. <strong>And since the average anime episode has on-screen text only for a small percentage of its total runtime, combining softsubbed dialogue and hardsubbed typesetting like this would make for a highly cost-effective setup.</strong></p>
<figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=""> <video poster="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/komi-novaworks-1-poster.jpg" controls="" preload="metadata" data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=""> <source src="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/komi-novaworks-1.mp4" type="video/mp4;codecs=avc1.640028,mp4a.40.2" data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=""> <span data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt="">It appears that your browser does not support playing this video.

Video clip from <em>Komi Can’t Communicate</em> (Fall&nbsp;2021, NovaWorks fansubs)</figcaption>  </figure>
<p>And since with a mixed system like this you would only have softsubs for the technically simpler dialogue, you could even convert these dialogue-only ASS subtitles to a simpler but more widely supported subtitle format for playback, <strong>which theoretically should do away with the need to keep fully hardsubbed copies around entirely, without any real loss in quality!</strong> I actually built a minimal version of a mixed system like this myself when I was doing some anime streaming work a few years back and can confidently say that <strong>this would be extremely doable for any official anime service… as long as they just cared enough.</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, any interest Crunchyroll had for improving their subtitle rendering for typesetting seemed to run out after the 2018 transition to WebAssembly libass. <strong>Not that it actually ever seemed to be all that high to begin with, though,</strong> as evident by some of the low-hanging fruit that Crunchyroll never bothered to pick in this regard; the most obvious of which would be Crunchyroll’s dogged insistence to restrict typesetting font choices to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_fonts_for_the_Web" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Core Fonts for the Web</a>. Free for commercial use fonts have been plentily available since the Flash days, and custom fonts have been well supported on the web for a similarly long time.</p>

<p>Anyway, it would have never been all that hard for Crunchyroll to support custom fonts for typesetting, especially after the 2018 move to HTML5. The underlying technology was there and font files are tiny in size compared to the video files being streamed – this would have been an extremely simple and effective improvement for all typesetting efforts. Yet Crunchyroll never reached for this improvement, which is why <span>Comic Sans</span> has kept appearing in Crunchyroll typesetting with depressing regularity.</p>

<p>It is also disappointing <strong>how regularly the anime staples of opening &amp; ending songs are still left untranslated on Crunchyroll,</strong> though this issue is admittedly <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2017-09-01/.120752" rel="noopener" target="_blank">much harder to solve than you’d expect.</a> Still, it is possible to do so, especially with Sony’s resources behind the company today. That goes double when Sony is involved in anime production in any way, as then the songs being used should be well-known to all relevant parties well in advance of airing for timely rights-clearing. <strong>So if Crunchyroll/Sony is in any way involved with an anime’s production, it should basically always be possible for songs to be translated the moment the first episode is released.</strong></p>
<p>But that’s enough about Crunchyroll’s history. Now it’s time to look at the other company mentioned earlier and see how they’ve fared in comparison…</p>
<h2 id="a-short-history-of-funimation-and-its-subtitling-standards">A short history of Funimation and its subtitling standards</h2>
<p>In the early 90s, Japanese-American businessman Gen Fukunaga was approached by his uncle who was working as a producer for Toei. A proposal was made: if Fukunaga could start an anime company in US, Toei would license the rights to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dragon Ball</a> franchise to it – a franchise that was already making mad cash in Japan. Sensing an opportunity, Fukunaga found investors, and thus in 1994 Funimation was born. A year later, Dragon Ball was on US TV, dubbed and edited to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060518193827/http://www.animecauldron.com/dbzuncensored2/misc/footsteps.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“conform to American sensibilities and tastes”</a>.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s, fueled by Dragon Ball’s success, Funimation started expanding its business by getting home video distribution rights for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4Kids_Entertainment" rel="noopener" target="_blank">4Kids Entertainment</a> licenses and non-Japanese kids’ cartoons, the latter eventually expanding into getting involved in production too. But beyond increased investment in kids’ cartoons, <strong>Funimation also started experimenting with more anime licenses of its own,</strong> the 2001 anime adaption for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruits_Basket" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fruits Basket</a> being one of its early standout releases.</p>
<p>Out of these various expansion attempts, <strong>“more anime” seemed to be the one to work out best,</strong> and towards the end of the 00s that became the main direction of Funimation’s business. This move was helped along by a bunch of licenses obtained from now-defunct US anime publishers Geneon USA and ADV. And in the spring of 2009, hot on the heels of Crunchyroll going legit, <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-04-03/funimation-adds-toei-air-master-captain-harlock" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Funimation announced that they too were getting into the anime streaming business</a>. The resulting anime streams from Funimation were hardsubbed and looked like this:</p>

<p>What you see here is exactly what you got: plain text at top center or bottom center, with dialogue on bottom, and translations for all on-screen text piled up top. <strong>So while overlaps were technically supported, full positioning did not seem to be possible,</strong> which made things quite awkward the moment there was more than one sign visible on the screen at the same time. <strong>This was also the standard you could expect from Funimation’s DVD and Blu-ray releases.</strong> And beyond the way too common dialogue three-liners (which are generally terrible for readability), sometimes you even saw <em>four-liners</em>:</p>
<figure id="maccaption-introduction" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""> <a href="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/d-frag-funi-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><img src="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/d-frag-funi-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""></a> <figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><p>Screenshot from <em>D-Frag!</em> (Winter&nbsp;2014, Funimation)</p></figcaption>  </figure>
<p>The subtitling software that Funimation was using at the time was <a href="https://www.telestream.net/captioning/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Telestream MacCaption</a>. In terms of usability and general authoring features, it was no match for Aegisub, although it was actually capable of doing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vut8ucz_dYY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">some overlaps, positioning, and styling</a> – Funimation just never chose to make use of these capabilities for its anime subtitles.</p>

<figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""> <a href="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/maccaption.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><img src="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/maccaption.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""></a> <figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><p>TeleStream stopped supporting MacCaption in 2023.</p></figcaption>  </figure>
<p>This remained the Funimation subtitle standard all the way until 2016, when Funimation struck a deal with Crunchyroll. <strong>Going forward, subtitled releases for Funimation licenses would be found on Crunchyroll,</strong> while dubbed releases for said titles would be on Funimation’s new streaming platform, <b>FunimationNow.</b></p>

<p>However, the only thing that really changed is that instead of Funimation content being hardsubbed on their website, <strong>it was now softsubbed on Crunchyroll to the exact same standard:</strong> plain text on top center or bottom center, often with three or more lines of dialogue at once, even.</p>
<figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""> <a href="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/sakura-quest-funiroll-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><img src="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/sakura-quest-funiroll-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""></a> <figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><p>Sometimes you could see sign translations on bottom too. Screenshot from <em>Sakura Quest</em> (Spring&nbsp;2017, Funimation/Crunchyroll)</p></figcaption>  </figure>
<p>Nothing else of particular note happened during this time period when it comes to Funimation’s subtitles. However, it is worth mentioning that <strong>Funimation dubs did have simple hardsubbed typesetting sometimes;</strong> this only seemed happen at the whim of the dubbing side of Funimation though, as these hardsubbed signs were never present in the subbed versions, nor were they a consistent feature of Funimation dubs in general.</p>

<p><strong>In 2017, Sony purchased Funimation</strong> as part of its growing collection of international anime distributors (Sony had previously bought Madman Anime and AnimeLab in Australia and Wakanim in Europe). As a result of this buyout, towards the end of 2018 the license sharing deal between Funimation and Crunchyroll was dissolved and soon after <strong>Funimation started serving new subtitled streams on FunimationNow, which were softsubbed</strong> and looked like this:</p>

<p><strong>No longer were the subtitles even making use of overlaps.</strong> Where dialogue translation used to go on bottom and sign translation on top when both were present, now all text was stuck on the same side of the screen together, either on top or bottom, but never both at the same time anymore.</p>
<p>How this further reduction in subtitling capabilities came about cannot be said for sure, but there are several possible explanations. For one, another major thing that happened at the end of 2018: <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-12-04/funimation-hulu-sign-first-look-streaming-deal-for-new-anime/.140359" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Funimation signed a big sublicensing deal</a> with the general streaming service <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hulu</a>, which meant <strong>dealing with Hulu’s subtitling standards and authoring accordingly limited subtitles</strong> – because as could be expected, the subtitling standards of a general streaming service did not account for the needs of anime in any real way.</p>
<figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""> <a href="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/mha-funi-hulu.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><img src="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/mha-funi-hulu.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""></a> <figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><p>Only the middle column of the blackboard is translated here. Good luck figuring that out with subtitles like these. Screenshot from <em>My Hero Academia 4</em> (Fall&nbsp;2019, Funimation/Hulu)</p></figcaption>  </figure>
<p id="ooona-introduction">Another possible reason for these less-than-great changes in Funimation’s subtitling standards was that around this time the company <strong>started using the cloud-based subtitling toolkit OOONA Tools</strong> by the localization service provider <a href="https://www.ooona.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OOONA</a>. OOONA Tools, by default, <strong>do not allow for the creation of subtitles with overlaps.</strong> While it can be done in OOONA today by tweaking the options or by using OOONA’s track features (which are quite similar to those of MacCaption, incidentally), it is possible that at the time these features were either not available or that it wasn’t possible to correctly export subtitles with overlaps to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WebVTT subtitle format</a> that was being used on FunimationNow.</p>

<figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""> <a href="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/ooona-create.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><img src="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/ooona-create.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""></a> <figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><p>Screenshot of <em>OOONA Create</em>, the primary subtitling software in OOONA Tools.</p></figcaption>  </figure>
<p>Regarding that last possibility in particular, there is <a href="https://archive.is/nRpg1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this OOONA FAQ entry</a> that mentions how <q>not all formats support […] overlapping subtitles</q> and that <q>Currently, it’s supported in IMSC1.1, ITT and Videotron Lambda CAP exports</q>. However, based on my own testing, OOONA Tools can properly export subtitles with overlaps in more formats today than just the ones mentioned here (including WebVTT), meaning that the FAQ entry is in fact outdated – <strong>but it was likely true at some point.</strong></p>
<p>In any case, this was the extremely limited standard of subtitling that Funimation customers had to live with until the service was shut down in 2024 as a result of the Funimation-Crunchyroll merger.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, what can we conclude from all this? If nothing else, one thing seems abundantly clear: <strong>the Funimation leadership never truly cared about or respected anime as a medium.</strong> From the very beginning, it’s clear that Gen Fukunaga (a businessman in his 30s at the time) got into the business <strong>with the mindset of making money with kids’ cartoons,</strong> and this only became more evident with how Funimation tried to expand into more types of kids’ cartoons before eventually realizing that anime is where the money was at.</p>
<p>But even with this eventual focus on more anime, <strong>no resources seem to have ever been dedicated to make typesetting an actual thing at Funimation,</strong> despite how obviously beneficial it would have been for their key product of localized anime. And the way Funimation never even bothered to figure out how to make the most of MacCaption, the expensive enterprise subtitling software they kept using for over a decade… while I speculated about possible technical reasons for Funimation abandoning even overlaps when they started producing softsubs for FunimationNow, there was always one possible additional reason: <strong>they just didn’t care at all.</strong> They ran into a problem, no resources were dedicated to fix the problem, and the subtitles got permanently worse as a result.</p>

Here’s Funimation in comparison. Video clip from <em>Danganronpa: The Animation</em> (Summer&nbsp;2013, Funimation)</figcaption>  </figure>
<p>The whole move to OOONA was questionable in itself, as while OOONA was capable of exporting subtitles to both WebVTT for FunimationNow and TTML (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SRT</a>, a very limited subtitle format) for Hulu in 2018, <em>so was MacCaption.</em> Why start paying for a monthly subscription service when your existing paid-for enterprise software should be able to deal with your needs just fine? I suspect the primary motivation behind the move (which could have even originated from the new parent company Sony) might have been the fact that it was trendy for companies at the time to move everything they possibly could to The Cloud™, regardless of how much sense it actually made… but that’s enough about OOONA for now.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <strong>Funimation’s subtitling standards were extremely poor to begin with, and they only managed to make them worse over time.</strong> That is something that only utter indifference or outright disdain for anime as a medium could bring about, which seems to have been the exact attitude that Gen Fukunaga cultivated at the executive levels of Funimation – <strong>and his followers appear to have carried the torch even after his departure from the company.</strong> But more on that in the next section, when we finally get to the Funimation-Crunchyroll merger.</p>

<h2 id="the-funimation-crunchyroll-merger-and-its-consequences">The Funimation-Crunchyroll merger and its consequences</h2>
<p>Following Sony’s 2017 purchase of Funimation, in 2019 Sony bought out Gen Fukunaga from the company entirely, which led to him stepping down as the General Manager, with Colin Decker taking his place. Soon after, Sony formed the Funimation Global Group to consolidate all the international anime publishing services it had bought, with Decker in charge of the joint venture as the CEO. Then, in late 2020, <strong>Sony announced that they were going to buy Crunchyroll, placing it under the executive control of the Funimation Global Group.</strong> The acquisition was completed in August 2021, coming with a statement from Sony that their goal is to <a href="https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2021/0809/sonysfunimationglobalgroupcompletesacquisitionofcrunchyrollfromatt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“create a unified anime subscription experience as soon as possible”</a>.</p>
<figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""> <a href="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/funiroll.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><img src="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/funiroll.jpg" alt="Crunchyroll and Funimation logos side by side." loading="lazy" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""></a> <figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><p>Soon, there would only be one.</p></figcaption>  </figure>
<p>Then, in March 2022, the news came that Funimation, Crunchyroll, Wakanim, and VRV (Crunchyroll’s more general streaming service) would all be merged together into a single streaming service that would exist under the name of Crunchyroll (as it had the strongest brand of the lot). <strong>Funimation Global Group LLC was renamed to Crunchyroll LLC, with Funimation executives remaining in charge.</strong> Soon after, Colin Decker stepped down as the CEO, with Rahul Purini (previously COO) taking his place. The merger was complete.</p>
<p>However, as is often the case with mergers &amp; acquisitions, layoffs were on the horizon. In 2023, <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2023-02-21/crunchyroll-lays-off-approximately-85-employees-globally/.195161" rel="noopener" target="_blank">85 people were laid off globally</a> in the name of employee redundancy. More layoffs have happened since then, with the most recent one being from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/crunchyroll-layoffs-restructuring-international-1236487273/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">just a couple months back in August 2025</a>.</p>

<p>Things weren’t much better for those left behind, as laid out in <a href="https://archive.ph/jxvFK" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this Bloomberg article</a> from 2024. Staff from Funimation was notably hostile towards those from Crunchyroll:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tension between the camps arose almost immediately. In a Zoom meeting announcing [Sony’s purchase of Crunchyroll], <strong>Funimation workers accused Crunchyroll of being pirates,</strong> alluding to the site’s history, according to two people who were present.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Crunchyroll workers were quickly frustrated with the new executives from Funimation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Current or former employees describe Crunchyroll’s new management–primarily from Funimation–as out-of-touch with employees and the anime fans the company once prioritized. <strong>Some executives write off anime as “kids’ cartoons,”</strong> they said, and resist hiring job candidates who describe themselves as fans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And while all these internal troubles were going on, Crunchyroll CEO Rahul Purini was excited to talk about <a href="https://archive.is/O1fjt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">how interested he is in AI-generated subtitles</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-typesetting-gets-destroyed">How typesetting gets destroyed</h3>
<p>In 2025, the executives came up with an idea: Crunchyroll should move away from <a href="#aegisub-ass-introduction">Aegisub and ASS subtitles with typesetting</a> and start producing exclusively <a href="#ttml-example">limited TTML subtitles without typesetting</a> in <a href="#ooona-introduction">OOONA Tools</a>. <strong>The likely end goal of this is to get rid of Crunchyroll’s <a href="#cr-libass">unique ASS-based subtitle rendering</a> entirely in favor of something more “industry standard” like TTML-based subtitle rendering.</strong> This would mean no longer having to pay staff for manual ASS-to-TTML conversion, as well as being able to drop the relatively expensive fully hardsubbed encodes for limited playback environments where ASS rendering is not possible <em>(but some sort of TTML rendering usually is).</em></p>

<p><strong>However, a major change affecting all aspects of the company’s subtitling pipeline doesn’t happen overnight,</strong> especially considering Crunchyroll’s large back catalog of ASS subtitles with typesetting that couldn’t be automatically converted to limited TTML subtitles without typesetting. So while the subtitling staff was to be (begrudgingly) busy experimenting and onboarding with OOONA and doing manual ASS-to-TTML conversions for back catalog titles, <strong>technical work would also need to be done to prepare for this vision of a TTML-only future.</strong></p>
<figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""> <a href="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/moneat-cr-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><img src="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/moneat-cr-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""></a> <figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><p>And what an exciting future of not being able to read signs that would be! Screenshot from <em>This Monster Wants to Eat Me</em> (Fall&nbsp;2025, Crunchyroll)</p></figcaption>  </figure>
<p>For this purpose, Crunchyroll seems to have decided that it would take its existing manual ASS-to-TTML conversions produced by the subtitling staff and treat them as the new master subtitle files. These TTML “masters” would then be—for the time being—converted back to ASS with <a href="https://www.closedcaptionconverter.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Closed Caption Converter</a> for use with the current ASS-based subtitle rendering. And so, with the start of the Fall 2025 anime season, a plan like this was pushed to production; while regular ASS subtitles were still being produced by Crunchyroll’s subtitling staff, <strong>these ASS subtitles with typesetting were generally left unused, while only limited ASS-to-TTML-to-ASS conversions without typesetting were being presented to customers on most shows.</strong></p>

<p>Implementing this interim pipeline with Closed Caption Converter didn’t seem to go exactly as planned, though, <strong>as some Fall 2025 shows on Crunchyroll ended up having no subtitles at all on release,</strong> including the premieres of the latest seasons of hit shows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Hero_Academia" rel="noopener" target="_blank">My Hero Academia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_%C3%97_Family" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Spy × Family</a>.</p>

<p id="cr-statement-2025-10-09">With the internet taking note of all this, on the 9th of October 2025 <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-10-09/crunchyroll-cites-internal-system-problems-regarding-subtitles-for-fall-2025-anime/.229669" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Crunchyroll responded to a press inquiry</a> by Anime News Network with the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past few days, some users experienced delays in accessing the content they wanted and subtitle issues across certain series. These were caused by internal system problems – not by any change in how we create subtitles, use of new vendors or AI. Those internal issues have now been fully resolved.</p>
<p>Quality subtitles are a core part of what makes watching anime on Crunchyroll so special. They connect global fans to the heart of every story, and we take that responsibility seriously.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience. We’re committed to continuing to deliver the authenticity, quality, and care that fans deserve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="cr-actions">Following this statement, some of the new Fall 2025 shows have had their ASS-to-TTML-to-ASS subtitles switched out to the previously unused regular ASS subtitles. Other shows haven’t. <strong>And some shows in the Crunchyroll back catalog have been updated with ASS-to-TTML-to-ASS subtitles,</strong> though the exact timing of these back catalog updates is unknown.</p>

<p>With all of this, <strong>the future of typesetting on Crunchyroll is unclear.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>And that’s how we’ve found ourselves in the situation we face today. Remember what the <a href="#cr-first-subs">first Crunchyroll subtitles from 2009</a> looked like? Yeah, these new subtitles adhering to limited TTML standards <em>are even worse than the subtitles from 2009</em> in terms of how on-screen text can be handled! In other words: <strong>The presentation quality of Crunchyroll’s first-party subtitles has reached an all-time low in 2025.</strong></p>
<figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""> <a href="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/chitose-cr-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><img src="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/chitose-cr-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""></a> <figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><p>Can’t even handle a next episode preview properly anymore. Screenshot from <em>Chitose Is in the Ramune Bottle</em> (Fall&nbsp;2025, Crunchyroll)</p></figcaption>  </figure>
<p>There is only one conclusion that can be drawn from that: <strong>the Funimation-turned-Crunchyroll executives still do not have any respect for anime as a medium.</strong> In addition, they seem to be treating Crunchyroll and its ways of doing things as the ways of <q>pirates</q> – which isn’t entirely incorrect, as Crunchyroll’s use of Aegisub and ASS <em>did</em> originate from the ways of pirate fansubbers. But fansubbers deeply care about anime as medium (they wouldn’t be illegally subtitling it for free as a hobby otherwise), which in turn means that <strong>the ways fansubbers have developed to subtitle anime are in fact extremely efficient for the job</strong> – much better than basically any “industry standards” for subtitling, even.</p>
<p>But that clearly doesn’t matter to the executives. <strong>The only thing that seems to be on their mind is how to best make money with kids’ cartoons</strong> that none of them personally watch, and what they seem to consider “best” is <em>getting rid of everything positively unique about Crunchyroll in favor of doing things the Funimation way,</em> even if that means ditching Aegisub and ASS in favor of OOONA Tools and TTML and getting rid of typesetting in the process. <span id="crunchyroll-maccaption">This</span> conclusion is further supported by the fact that <strong>Crunchyroll has kept Funimation’s old <a href="#maccaption-introduction">MacCaption-based workflow</a> around for its Blu-ray releases,</strong> with notable reduction in typesetting quality on Blu-ray as a result:</p>


<p>Then there’s the whole plan of moving to OOONA in general, which is even more questionable than it was back in the Funimation days. <strong>Crunchyroll has a lot more to lose in terms of subtitle quality than Funimation ever did,</strong> yet the executives seem to want to go back to their “old reliable” regardless. I can’t even see it saving them any money in the long run, considering that Aegisub is completely free software while OOONA will incur constant ongoing costs with its per-user subscription pricing. Rather than authoring limited TTML in OOONA directly, <strong>paying the subtitling staff to keep the manual ASS to TTML conversions going would likely be cheaper!</strong></p>

<p>Beyond that, there is also the thing about <strong>OOONA being an Israeli company.</strong> It is certainly a choice, not only in 2018 but most certainly in 2025, to heavily invest in the services of a company from a country that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_genocide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">actively committing genocide</a>. However, to quell some unsubstantiated internet discourse I have seen in relation to this, I do want to emphasize that <strong>OOONA being Israeli is not really directly relevant to the quality issues this article is about.</strong></p>
<figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""> <a href="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/eztitles.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><img src="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/eztitles.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""></a> <figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><p>EZTitles is another popular enterprise subtitling software. Notice how they mention AI directly in their navigation.</p></figcaption>  </figure>
<p>The reason for this lies in enterprise subtitling software (“industry standards”) being universally poor when it comes to producing high quality typesetting for anime, so it wouldn’t really matter which software suite a switch was being made to – <strong>no matter what, moving away from Aegisub would destroy typesetting as it currently exists on Crunchyroll.</strong> And while Crunchyroll’s CEO has expressed his interest in AI subtitles, at least currently there has been no signs of any kind of AI (Israeli or otherwise) being used to create first-party subtitles on Crunchyroll.</p>

<h3 id="why-crunchyroll-is-so-confident-it-will-get-away-with-this-or-how-capitalism-ruins-everything">Why Crunchyroll is so confident it will get away with this (or: how capitalism ruins everything)</h3>
<p>Finally, I want to talk about the possible reasons for Crunchyroll executives feeling so confident about getting away with making their own primary product so much worse. Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that <strong>international anime licensing operates primarily on an exclusive licensing model.</strong> This means that generally only one service will be able to offer a specific title in specific language(s) in specific region(s), unless the service voluntarily decides to sublicense it out to others. This in turn upends the assumption that the existence of multiple anime services would be beneficial to consumers, <strong>as the services don’t actually have to engage in competition on customer-beneficial factors like service quality almost at all</strong> – instead, they can just focus on hoarding as many exclusive licenses as possible.</p>
<figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""> <a href="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/kun-gao-ama.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><img src="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/kun-gao-ama.png" alt="Screenshot of three comments from a Reddit AMA. Check the link in the caption to read the contents in full." loading="lazy" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""></a> <figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><p>I once asked former Crunchyroll CEO Kun Gao about “exclusivity or completeness” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2b26ou/im_kun_gao_the_cofounder_and_ceo_of_crunchyroll/cj12zuo/?context=3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in this Reddit AMA.</a> He dodged the question but basically said “exclusivity”.</p></figcaption>  </figure>
<p>This kind of “competition” twisted by exclusive licensing is more like a casino, where the customers might occasionally be thrown a bone, <strong>but at the end of the day, the house always wins.</strong> And the anime companies very much prefer to keep it that way, even if it means never being able to offer full coverage of new anime seasons – a limited amount of exclusives is much more important to them. Dreams of infinite growth are what drives the modern-day game of capitalism, and spending money to please customers rather than shareholders goes directly against said dreams. <strong>It’s all about spending as little money as possible to make as much money as possible.</strong></p>
<p>This is why the capitalists in charge of all the big companies these days are so excited about AI too: nothing gets them going more than the idea of not having for pay for those pesky human employees. <em>This is no doubt the actual reason why Crunchyroll CEO Rahul Purini is interested in AI subtitles.</em> It doesn’t matter that <em>anime localization costs are a drop in the bucket compared to the overall costs of anime production,</em> even if you were talking about super high quality work with fansub-level typesetting. <em>Any excuse to cut the wages of real human workers is one step closer to the next yacht purchase for the executive upper class.</em></p>
<p>…Whew, got a bit heated there. Anyway, the most likely reason why Crunchyroll executives believe they can get away with reducing the quality of their own service so much? <strong>Because Crunchyroll doesn’t have any meaningful competition thanks to the primarily-exclusive licensing model used by the international anime industry.</strong> Even if they make the service worse, what can you do about it? Cancel your subscription and not watch the new anime you’re excited about?</p>
<h2 id="what-you-can-do-about-it">What you can do about it</h2>
<p>If you are currently subscribed to Crunchyroll, <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/cancellation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cancel your subscription.</a> <strong>When asked for a reason, mention the bad subtitle quality and lack of <a href="#typesetting-introduction">typesetting.</a></strong> <em>You could even link to this article.</em> Beyond that, and this applies to people who aren’t subscribed to Crunchyroll as well: <strong>spread the word!</strong> Share this article around, talk to people about how Crunchyroll is destroying its subtitles, make it so that Crunchyroll executives can’t ignore the issue. And the most important thing: <strong>Keep it up until Crunchyroll actually makes a clear public commitment to keep typesetting anime.</strong></p>

<p>Why ask for an explicit commitment? Because back in 2017 <a href="https://medium.com/@Daiz/crunchyrolls-reduced-video-quality-is-deliberate-cost-cutting-at-the-expense-of-paying-customers-c86c6899033b" rel="noopener" target="_blank">when Crunchyroll tried to drastically lower its video quality as a cost-cutting measure</a>, vocal user complaints and subscription cancellations forced them to backtrack on it, eventually leading the company to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210622165834/http://www.crunchyroll.com/forumtopic-985103/our-statement-regarding-recent-video-quality-issues#expand" rel="noopener" target="_blank">make a statement</a> and not just <a href="https://medium.com/ellation-tech/improving-video-quality-for-crunchyroll-and-vrv-dd587261a364" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one</a> but <a href="https://medium.com/ellation-tech/stabilizing-improving-crunchyroll-service-c44c53789e86" rel="noopener" target="_blank">two</a> technical follow-up posts where it <em>explicitly promised</em> to do better, <strong>and in the end, video quality actually improved compared to what was previously available.</strong> Ideally, the same would happen with Crunchyroll’s typesetting here.</p>
<figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""> <a href="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/cr-video-quality-promise.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><img src="https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/cr-video-quality-promise.png" alt="Screenshot of the first technical post from 2017 linked above, showing it's title of Improving Video Quality for Crunchyroll and VRV." loading="lazy" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""></a> <figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=""><p>“Improving Subtitle Quality for Crunchyroll” is what we’d like to see here in 2025.</p></figcaption>  </figure>

<p>I also want to emphasize that the <a href="#cr-statement-2025-10-09">recent statement</a> Crunchyroll made about its Fall 2025 subtitles <strong>isn’t really worth anything.</strong> It’s worded in an intentionally obfuscated manner as to what actually has been <q>fixed</q> – is it the lack of typesetting or just the issues with subtitles not going up for new releases? Then it just outright lies about there being <q>no changes</q> with <a href="#how-typesetting-gets-destroyed">how subtitles are being handled</a>, before ending on empty platitudes about <q>quality subtitles</q> that mean nothing without concrete actions to back them up.</p>
<p>And so far, <strong><a href="#cr-actions">the actions of Crunchyroll</a> have made the future of typesetting on the service anything but clear.</strong> The lower quality subtitles in the back catalog are especially alarming, as the back catalog was exactly where Crunchyroll also started with its 2017 video quality reduction plans, all the while remaining careful with changes to simulcasts where people were paying closer attention – <strong>which is exactly what seems to be happening with subtitles on Crunchyroll right now.</strong></p>

<hr>
<p><b>To sum things up:</b> Without a clear public commitment to stick to higher subtitling standards that include typesetting, it is very likely that Crunchyroll executives will just delay their typesetting-killing plans and try again later. That’s why <em>you</em> need to <a href="#what-you-can-do-about-it">cancel your subscription</a>, encourage others to do so, and keep talking about this issue <em>until Crunchyroll explicitly promises to do better.</em></p>
<p><strong>Together, we can save Crunchyroll from itself!</strong></p>

<p>I’m not the only one to have made note of Crunchyroll’s recent subtitle shenanigans, so here’s some additional reading/watching on the subject elsewhere:</p>

<li><a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2025-10-27/.230367" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Are Subtitles Getting Smaller?</a> by <b>Jerome Mazandarani</b> on <b>Anime News Network</b>. This <b>Answerman</b> column is nominally about subtitles getting visually smaller, but most of it ends up being about the Crunchyroll subtitle situation. Jerome does keep incorrectly saying that general streaming services use the very bare-bones subtitle format SRT rather than TTML, though, and while these services do support SRT for ingestion (ie. content partners can deliver subtitles as SRT) and anime companies might even be making use of that, TTML is what the services actually use internally. SRT does not officially support any kind of positioning whatsoever, which means that even placing subtitles at the top of the screen would be impossible with it if the normal placement was on bottom.</li>

Markgraf’s implementation uses the PIO and DMA to perform MLT-3 encoding, 4B5B line coding, and scrambling at a 125 MHz symbol rate. The result is a functioning 100 Mbit/s link capable of streaming about 11 Mbyte/s over UDP, demonstrated by real-time audio and ADC data streams.</p></div>

<p>WASHINGTON — Widespread 20<sup>th</sup>-century reforestation in the eastern United States helped counter rising temperatures due to climate change, according to <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF003663">new research</a>. The authors highlight the potential of forests as regional climate adaptation tools, which are needed along with a decrease in carbon emissions.</p>
<p>“It’s all about figuring out how much forests can cool down our environment and the extent of the effect,” said Mallory Barnes, lead author of the study and an environmental scientist at Indiana University. “This knowledge is key not only for large-scale reforestation projections aimed at climate mitigation, but also for initiatives like urban tree planting.”</p>
<p>The study was published in the AGU journal <em>Earth’s Future</em>, which publishes interdisciplinary research on the past, present and future of our planet and its inhabitants.</p>
<h3><strong>Return of the trees</strong></h3>
<p>Before European colonization, the eastern United States was almost entirely covered in temperate forests. From the late 18<sup>th</sup> to early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, timber harvests and clearing for agriculture led to forest losses exceeding 90% in some areas. In the 1930s, efforts to revive the forests, coupled with the abandonment and subsequent reforestation of subpar agricultural fields, kicked off an almost century-long comeback for eastern forests. About <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00166.x">15 million hectares</a> of forest have since grown in these areas.</p>
<p>“The extent of the deforestation that happened in the eastern United States is remarkable, and the consequences were grave,” said Kim Novick, an environmental scientist at Indiana University and co-author of the new study. “It was a dramatic land cover change, and not that long ago.”</p>
<div id="attachment_24156"><p><a href="https://news.agu.org/files/2024/02/warming-hole.png"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-24156" src="https://news.agu.org/files/2024/02/warming-hole.png" alt="" width="255" height="131" srcset="https://news.agu.org/files/2024/02/warming-hole.png 729w, https://news.agu.org/files/2024/02/warming-hole-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-24156"><em>The “warming hole,” or anomalously cool region, is shown in blue. Credit: Barnes et al.</em></p></div>
<p>During the period of regrowth, global warming was well underway, with temperatures across North America <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-us-and-global-temperature">rising</a> 0.7 degrees Celsius (1.23 degrees Fahrenheit) on average. In contrast, from 1900 to 2000, the East Coast and Southeast cooled by about 0.3 degrees Celsius (0.5 degrees Fahrenheit), with the strongest cooling in the southeast.</p>
<p>Previous studies suggested the cooling could be caused by aerosols, agricultural activity or increased precipitation, but many of these factors would only explain highly localized cooling. Despite known relationships between forests and cooling, studies had not considered forests as a possible explanation for the anomalous, widespread cooling.</p>
<p>“This widespread history of reforestation, a huge shift in land cover, hasn’t been widely studied for how it could’ve contributed to the anomalous lack of warming in the eastern U.S., which climate scientists call a ‘warming hole,’” Barnes said. “That’s why we initially set out to do this work.”</p>

<h3><strong>Trees are cool</strong></h3>
<p>Barnes, Novick and their team used a combination of data from satellites and 58 meteorological towers to compare forests to nearby grasslands and croplands, allowing an examination of how changes in forest cover can influence ground surface temperatures and in the few meters of air right above the surface.</p>
<p>The researchers found that forests in the eastern U.S. today cool the land’s surface by 1 to 2 degrees Celsius (1.8 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) annually. The strongest cooling effect occurs at midday in the summer, when trees lower temperatures by 2 to 5 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit) — providing relief when it’s needed most.</p>
<p>Using data from a network of gas-measuring towers, the team showed that this cooling effect also extends to the air, with forests lowering the near-surface air temperature by up to 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) during midday. (Previous work on trees’ cooling effect has focused on land, not air, temperatures.)</p>

<p>The team then used historic land cover and daily weather data from 398 weather stations to track the relationship between forest cover and land and near-surface air temperatures from 1900 to 2010. They found that by the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, weather stations surrounded by forests were up to 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than locations that did not undergo reforestation. Spots up to 300 meters (984 feet) away were also cooled, suggesting the cooling effect of reforestation could have extended even to unforested parts of the landscape.</p>
<p>Other factors, such as changes in agricultural irrigation, may have also had a cooling effect on the study region. The reforestation of the eastern United States in the 20<sup>th</sup> century likely contributed to, but cannot fully explain, the cooling anomaly, the authors said.</p>
<p>“It’s exciting to be able to contribute additional information to the long-standing and perplexing question of, ‘Why hasn’t the eastern United States warmed at a rate commensurate with the rest of the world?’” Barnes said. “We can’t explain all of the cooling, but we propose that reforestation is an important part of the story.”</p>
<p>Reforestation in the eastern United States is generally regarded as a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.aat1869">viable strategy</a> for climate mitigation due to the capacity of these forests to sequester and store carbon. The authors note that their work suggests that eastern United States reforestation also represents an important tool for climate adaptation. However, in different environments, such as snow-covered boreal regions, adding trees could have a warming effect. In some locations, reforestation can also affect precipitation, cloud cover, and other regional scale processes in ways that may or may not be beneficial. Land managers must therefore consider other environmental factors when evaluating the utility of forests as a climate adaptation tool.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div lang="en"><section id="sec1"><p id="p-1">The Internet underlies much of modern life, connecting billions of users via access networks across wide-area backbones to countless services running in datacenters. The commercial Internet grew quickly in the 1990s and early 2000s because it was relatively easy for network owners to connect interoperable equipment, such as routers, without relying on a central administrative authority. However, a small number of router vendors controlled both the hardware and the software on these devices, leaving network owners with limited control over how their networks behave. Adding new network capabilities required support from these vendors and a multi-year standardization process to ensure interoperability across vendors. The result was bloated router software with tens of millions of lines of code, networks that were remarkably difficult to manage, and a frustratingly slow pace of innovation.</p><p id="p-2">All of this changed with <i>software-defined networking</i> (SDN), where network owners took control over how their networks behaved. The key ideas were simple. First, network devices should offer a common <i>open interface directly to their packet-forwarding logic</i>. This interface allows separate control software to install fine-grained rules that govern how a network device handles different kinds of packets: which packets to drop, where to forward the remaining packets, how to modify the packet headers, and so on. Second, a network should have <i>logically centralized control</i>, where the control software has network-wide visibility and direct control across the distributed collection of network devices. Rather than running on the network devices themselves, the software can run on a separate set of computers that monitor and control the devices of a single network in real time.</p><p id="p-3">The first commercial deployments of SDN started around 2008, and its success can be traced back to two intertwined developments that reinforced each other. The first was academic research funded mostly by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF). The second was cloud companies starting to build enormous datacenters, which required a new kind of network to interconnect thousands of racks of servers. In a virtuous cycle, the adoption of SDN by the hyperscalers drove further academic research, which in turn created more research, important new innovations, and several successful start-up companies.</p><p id="p-4">As a result, SDN revolutionized how networks are built and operated today—the public Internet, private networks in commercial companies, university networks and government networks, and all the way through to the cellular networks that interconnect our smartphones.</p><section id="sec2"><p data-jats-content-type="inline-heading"><strong>Early NSF-funded SDN research.</strong>&nbsp; In 2001, a National Academies report,&nbsp;<i>Looking Over the Fence at Networks: A Neighbor’s View of Networking Research,</i><a href="#B30" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B30"><sup>30</sup></a> pointed to the perils of Internet ossification: an inability of networks to change to satisfy new needs. The report highlighted three dimensions of ossification: <i>intellectual</i> (backward compatibility limits creative ideas), <i>infrastructure</i> (it is hard to deploy new ideas into the infrastructure), and <i>system</i> (rigid architecture led to fragile, shoe-horned solutions). In an unprecedented move, the NSF set out to address Internet ossification by investing heavily over the next decade. NSF investments laid the groundwork for SDN. We describe NSF investments here, through the lens of the support we received in our own research groups. Importantly, these and other government-funded research programs fostered a community of researchers that together paved the way for commercial adoption of SDN in the years that followed.</p><p id="p-6"><b>100×100 project:</b> In 2003, the NSF launched the 100×100 project as part of its Information Technology Research program. The goal of the 100×100 project was to create communication architectures that could provide 100Mb/s networking for all 100 million American homes. The project brought together researchers from Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, Berkeley, and AT&amp;T. One key aspect of the 100×100 project was the design of better ways to manage large networks. This research led to the 4D architecture for logically centralized network control of a distributed data plane<a href="#B21" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B21"><sup>21</sup></a> (which itself built upon and generalized the routing control platform work at AT&amp;T<a href="#B15" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B15"><sup>15</sup></a>), Ethane (a system for logically centralized control of access control in enterprise networks),<a href="#B11" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B11"><sup>11</sup></a> and OpenFlow (an open interface for installing match-action rules in network switches),<a href="#B28" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B28"><sup>28</sup></a> as well as the creation of the first open source network controller, NOX.<a href="#B22" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B22"><sup>22</sup></a></p><p id="p-7"><b>Global Environment for Network Innovation (GENI):</b> NSF and researchers wanted to try out new Internet architectures on a nationwide, or global, platform. Computer virtualization was widely used to share a common physical infrastructure, so could we do the same for a network? In 2005, “Overcoming the Internet Impasse through Virtualization” proposed an approach.<a href="#B5" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B5"><sup>5</sup></a> The next year, NSF created the GENI program, with the goal of creating a shared, programmable national infrastructure for researchers to experiment with alternative Internet architectures at scale. GENI funded early OpenFlow deployments on college campuses, sliced by FlowVisor<a href="#B35" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B35"><sup>35</sup></a> to allow multiple experimental networks to run alongside each other on the same production network, each managed by their own experimental controller. This, in turn, led to a proliferation of new open source controllers (Beacon, POX, and Floodlight). GENI also led to a programmable virtualized backbone network platform,<a href="#B6" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B6"><sup>6</sup></a> and an experimental OpenFlow backbone network in Internet2 connecting multiple universities. This led to OpenFlow-enabled switches from Cisco, HP, and NEC. GENI funded the purchase of OpenFlow whitebox switches from ODM manufacturers and the open source software to manage them. NSF funded the NetFPGA project, which enabled experimental OpenFlow switches in Internet2. NSF brought together a community of researchers driven by much more than the desire to create experimental test beds; many researchers came to realize that programmability and virtualization were, in fact, key capabilities needed for future networks.<a href="#B5" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B5"><sup>5</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#B16" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B16"><sup>16</sup></a></p><p id="p-8"><b>Future Internet Design (FIND):</b> In 2007, NSF started the FIND program to support new Internet architectures that could be prototyped and evaluated on the GENI test bed. The FIND program and its successor Future Internet Architecture (FIA) in 2010 expanded the community, working on clean-slate network architectures and fostering alternative designs. The resulting ideas were bold and exciting, including better support for mobility, content delivery, user privacy, secure cloud computing, and more. NSF’s FIND and FIA programs fostered many clean-slate network designs with prototypes and real-world evaluation, many leveraged SDN and improved its foundations. As momentum for clean-slate networking research grew in the U.S., the rest of the world followed suit, such as the EU Future Internet Research and Experimentation (FIRE) program.</p><p id="p-9"><b>Programmable Open Mobile Internet (POMI) Expedition:</b> In 2008, the NSF POMI Expedition at Stanford expanded funding for SDN, including its use in mobile networks. POMI funded the early development of ONOS, an open source distributed controller,<a href="#B8" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B8"><sup>8</sup></a> and the widely used Mininet network emulator for teaching SDN and for testing ideas before deploying them in real networks. POMI also funded the first explorations of programmable forwarding planes, setting the stage for the first fully programmable switch chip<a href="#B10" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B10"><sup>10</sup></a> and the widely used P4 language.<a href="#B9" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B9"><sup>9</sup></a></p></section><section id="sec3"><p data-jats-content-type="inline-heading"><strong>SDN adoption by cloud hyperscalers.</strong>&nbsp; In parallel with the early academic research on SDN, large technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook began building large datacenters full of servers that hosted these companies’ popular Internet services and, increasingly, the services of enterprise customers. Datacenter owners grew frustrated with the cost and complexity of the commercially available networking equipment; a typical datacenter switch cost more than $20,000 and a hyperscaler needed about 10,000 switches per site. They decided they could build their own switch box for about $2,000 using off-the-shelf switching chips from companies such as Broadcom and Marvell, and then use their own armies of software developers to create optimized, tailored software using modern software practices. Reducing cost was good, but it was control they wanted and SDN gave them a quick path to get it.</p><p id="p-11">The hyperscalers used SDN to realize two especially important use cases. First, within a single datacenter, cloud providers wanted to virtualize their networks to provide a separate virtual network for each enterprise customer (or “tenant”) with its own IP address space and networking policies. The start-up company Nicira, which emerged from the NSF-funded Ethane project, developed the Network Virtualization Platform (NVP)<a href="#B26" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B26"><sup>26</sup></a> to meet this need. Nicira was later acquired by VMware and NVP became NSX. Nicira also created Open vSwitch (OVS),<a href="#B33" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B33"><sup>33</sup></a> an open source <i>virtual switch</i>&nbsp;for Linux, with an OpenFlow interface. OVS grew rapidly and became the key to enabling network virtualization in datacenters around the world. Second, the hyperscalers wanted to control traffic flows across their new private wide-area networks and between their datacenters. Google adopted SDN to control how traffic is routed in its B4 backbone,<a href="#B23" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B23"><sup>23</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#B39" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B39"><sup>39</sup></a> using OpenFlow switches, controlled by ONIX, the first distributed controller platform.<a href="#B27" data-jats-ref-type="bibr" data-jats-rid="B27"><sup>27</sup></a> When Google first described B4 at the Open Network Summit in 2012, it sparked a global surge in research and commercialization of SDN. There were so many papers at ACM SIGCOMM that a separate conference—Hot Topics in Software-Defined Networking (HotSDN, later SOSR) was formed.</p><p id="p-12">These two high-profile use cases—multi-tenant virtualization and wide-area traffic engineering—drew significant commercial attention to SDN. Indeed, NSF-funded research led directly to the creation of several successful SDN start-up companies, including Big Switch Networks (open source SDN controllers and management applications, acquired by Arista), Forward Networks (network verification products), Veriflow (developed network verification products, acquired by VMware), and Barefoot Networks (programmable switches, acquired by Intel), to name a few. SDN influenced the large networking vendors, with Cisco, Juniper, Arista, HP, and NEC all creating SDN products. Today, AMD, Nvidia, Intel, and Cisco all sell P4-programmable products, and in 2019 about a third of papers appearing at ACM SIGCOMM were based on P4 or programmable forwarding.</p><p id="p-13">The commercial success of SDN drove further interest among academic researchers. The NSF and other government agencies, especially the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), sponsored further research on SDN platforms and use cases that continues to this day. The SDN research community broadened significantly, well beyond computer networking, to include researchers in the neighboring disciplines of programming languages, formal verification, distributed systems, algorithms, security and privacy, and more, all helping lay stronger foundations for future networks.</p><p id="p-14">This article summarizes the story of how SDN arose. So many research projects, papers, companies, and products arose because of SDN that it is impossible to include all of them here. The foresight of NSF in the early 2000s, funding a generation of researchers at just the right time, working closely with the rapidly growing hyperscalers, led quite literally to a transformation—a revolution—in how networks are built today.</p></section></section><section id="sec4"><h2>SDN Grew First and Fastest in Datacenters</h2><p id="p-15">The first large-scale deployments of SDN took place in hyperscale data centers, beginning about 2010. The story is best told by the hyperscaler companies themselves, and so we asked leaders at Google, Microsoft Azure, and Meta to tell their stories about why and how they adopted SDN. As you will see, they all started from the ideas and principles that came from the NSF-funded research; and each tailored SDN to suit their specific needs and culture.</p><p id="p-34">The Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and telecommunication companies also had a strong interest in SDN. AT&amp;T played a large role in its definition, engaging in research and early deployments in the mid 2000s. We invited Albert Greenberg, who was at AT&amp;T at the time, to tell the story.</p><p id="p-39">Nicira was perhaps the startup that epitomized the SDN movement. It grew out of the NSF-funded <span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mn>100</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>100</mn></mrow></math></span> program and the Clean Slate Program at Stanford, based on the Ph.D. work of Martín Casado. Nicira developed ONIX, the first distributed control plane, used by Google in its infrastructure; OVS, the first OpenFlow-compliant software switch; and NVP (later NSX), the first network virtualization platform. We invited Teemu Koponen, a principal architect at Nicira, to tell the story.</p><p id="p-47">During the early 2010s, the networking industry began to realize that SDN has many big advantages. It lifts complex protocols up and out of the switches into the control plane, where it is written in a modern programming language. This made it possible to reason about the correctness of the protocols simply by examining the software controlling the network and the forwarding state maintained by the switches. For the first time, it became possible to formally verify the behavior of a complete network.</p><p id="p-48">Researchers, startups, network equipment vendors, and hyperscalers have all taken advantage of SDN principles to develop new ways to verify network behavior. We invited Professor George Varghese, who has been deeply involved in network verification research, to give us his perspective on network verification.</p><p id="p-55">A main benefit of SDN is that it hands over the keys (of control) from the networking equipment vendors—who kept their systems closed and proprietary, and hence tended to evolve slowly—to software programmers, who could define the behavior for themselves, often in open source software. And indeed it happened: Today, most large networks are controlled by software written by those who own and operate networks rather than by networking equipment vendors.</p><p id="p-56">But what about the hardware? Switches, routers, firewalls, and network interface cards are all built from special-purpose ASICs—highly integrated, cost-effective, and super-fast. The problem was the features and protocols that operated on packets (for example, forwarding, routing, firewalls, and security) were all baked into hardware at the time the chip was designed, two to three years before it was deployed. What if the network owner and operator needed to change and evolve the behavior in their network, for example to add a new way to measure traffic or a new way to verify behavior? A group of researchers and entrepreneurs set out to make the switches and NICs programmable by the user, to allow more rapid improvement and give the operator greater control. Not only did new programmable devices emerge, but a whole open source movement around the P4 programming language.</p><p id="p-57">We invited Professor Nate Foster, who leads the P4 language ecosystem, to tell the story of how programmable forwarding planes came about.</p><p id="p-62">So far, we have focused on SDN <i>wireline</i> networks running over electrical and optical cables in datacenters, enterprises, and long-haul WANs. SDN was originally defined with wireline networks in mind.</p><p id="p-63">Yet, for cellular networks, the most widely used networks in the world, the need was even greater: Cellular networks have been held back for decades by closed, proprietary, and complex “standards” designed to allow equipment vendors to maintain a strong grip on the market. SDN provides an opportunity to open up networks, introducing well-defined control APIs and interfaces, moving control software to common operating systems running on commodity servers.</p><p id="p-64">This story has only just begun, but it started thanks to NSF-funded research in the mid 2000s, then boosted by DARPA-funded programs to support open source software for cellular infrastructure. We invited Guru Parulkar and Oğuz Sunay to tell the story, both of whom developed open source cellular systems at the Open Networking Foundation and for the DARPA-funded Pronto project.</p></section><section id="sec5"><h2>Conclusion</h2><p id="p-73">The investments NSF made in SDN over the past two decades have paid huge dividends. SDN transformed how companies run their datacenter, enterprise, cellular, and backbone networks, and created a pathway for creative new ideas to see widespread deployment. The biggest beneficiaries are the billions of people who have a much more reliable, more secure, lower-cost, and faster Internet for the services they use every day.</p><p id="p-74">NSF invested in the foundations of SDN at a very early stage, back when it seemed unthinkable that network owners—rather than a few incumbent equipment vendors—could decide how networks behave. NSF nurtured the growing interest in SDN over many years, fostering a vibrant research community, critical software building blocks, and key early start-up companies that made SDN technologies available in practice. The Internet, and indeed computing and communication technologies in general, need the kind of bold, ongoing innovation that NSF makes possible.</p></section></div></div>]]></description>

A <strong>brilliant</strong> new tool called <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/" rel="nofollow">uv</a> came out recently that <strong>revolutionizes</strong> how easy installing and using Python can be.</p> <p>uv is a free, open-source tool built by Astral, a small startup that has been churning out Python tools (like the excellent linter <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/" rel="nofollow">Ruff</a>) for the past few years. uv can:</p> <ul><li>Install any Python version for you</li> <li>Install packages</li> <li>Manage virtual environments</li> <li>Solve dependency conflicts <em>extremely</em> quickly (<strong>very</strong> important for big projects.)</li></ul> <p>What’s best is that it can do all of the above <strong>better than any other tool</strong>, in my opinion. It’s <strong>shockingly fast</strong>, written in Rust, and works on almost any operating system or platform.</p> <h2>Installing uv</h2> <p>uv is <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation" rel="nofollow">straightforward to install</a>. There are a few ways, but the easiest (in my opinion) is this one-liner command — for Linux and Mac, it’s:</p> <pre><!----><code><span>curl</span> <span>-LsSf</span> https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh <span>|</span> <span>sh</span></code><!----></pre> <p>or on Windows in powershell:</p> <pre><!----><code>powershell <span>-ExecutionPolicy</span> ByPass <span>-c</span> <span>"irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"</span></code><!----></pre> <p>You can then access uv with the command <code>uv</code>. <strong>Installing uv will not mess up any of your existing Python installations</strong> — it’s a separate tool, so it’s safe to install it just to try it out.</p> <h2>Managing Python for a project</h2> <p>It’s always a good idea to work with <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41972261/what-is-a-virtualenv-and-why-should-i-use-one" rel="nofollow">virtual environments</a> for any Python project. It keeps different bits of code and dependencies ringfenced from one another, and in my experience, it can save <strong>a lot</strong> of hassle to get into the habit of using virtual environments as soon as you can. uv naturally uses virtual environments, so it’s very easy to start using them if you get into using uv.</p> <p>uv will build a Python environment for you based on what’s specified in a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file in the directory (or parent directories) you’re working in. <code>pyproject.toml</code> files are a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62983756/what-is-pyproject-toml-file-for" rel="nofollow">standard, modern format</a> for specifying dependencies for a Python project. A barebones one might look a bit like this:</p> <pre><!----><code><span>[</span><span>project</span><span>]</span>
<span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"my_project"</span>
<span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1.0.0"</span>
<span>requires-python</span> <span>=</span> <span>"&gt;=3.9,&lt;3.13"</span>
<span>dependencies</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>"astropy&gt;=5.0.0"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"pandas&gt;=1.0.0,&lt;2.0"</span><span>,</span>
<span>]</span></code><!----></pre> <p>In essence, it just has to specify <strong>which Python version to use</strong> and <strong>some dependencies.</strong> Adding a name and version number also aren’t a bad idea.</p> <p>(Sidenote: for projects that you publish as packages, such as to the Python Package Index that pip and uv use, <code>pyproject.toml</code> files are a modern way to specify <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/" rel="nofollow">everything you need</a> to publish your package.)</p> <h2>Making a new project with uv</h2> <p>To start a new Python project with uv, you can run</p> <pre><!----><code>uv init</code><!----></pre> <p>Which will create a new project for you, with a <code>pyproject.toml</code>, a <code>README.md</code>, and other important bits of boilerplate.</p> <p>There are a lot of different ways to run this command, like <code>uv init --bare</code> (which only creates a pyproject.toml), <code>uv init --package</code> (which sets up a new Python package), and more. I recommend running <code>uv init --help</code> to read about them.</p> <h2>Once you have/if you already have a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file</h2> <p>Once you initialize a project — or if you already have a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file in your project — it’s very easy to start using uv. You just need to do</p> <pre><!----><code>uv <span>sync</span></code><!----></pre> <p>in the directory that your <code>pyproject.toml</code> file is in. This command (and in fact, most uv commands if you haven’t ran it already) will:</p> <ol><li>Automatically install a valid version of Python</li> <li>Install all dependencies to a new virtual environment in the directory <code>.venv</code></li> <li>Create a <code>uv.lock</code> file in your directory, which saves the <strong>exact, platform-agnostic</strong> version of <strong>every</strong> package installed — meaning that other colleagues can replicate your Python environment exactly.</li></ol> <p>In principle, you can ‘activate’ this new virtual environment like any typical virtual environment that you may have seen in other tools, but the most ‘uv-onic’ way to use uv is simply to prepend any command with <code>uv run</code>. This command automatically picks up the correct virtual environment for you and runs your command with it. For instance, to run a script — instead of</p> <pre><!----><code><span>source</span> .venv/bin/activate
python myscript.py</code><!----></pre> <p>you can just do</p> <pre><!----><code>uv run myscript.py</code><!----></pre> <p>which will have the same effect. Likewise, to use a ‘tool’ like Jupyter Lab, you can just do</p> <pre><!----><code>uv run jupyter lab</code><!----></pre> <p>in your project’s directory, as opposed to first ‘activating’ the environment and then running <code>jupyter lab</code> separately.</p> <h2>Adding dependencies</h2> <p>You can always just edit your <code>pyproject.toml</code> file manually: uv will detect the changes and rebuild your project’s virtual environment. But uv also has easier ways to add dependencies — you can just do</p> <pre><!----><code>uv <span>add</span> numpy<span>&gt;=</span><span>2.0</span></code><!----></pre> <p>to add a package, including specifying version constraints (like the above.) This command automatically edits your <code>pyproject.toml</code> for you. <code>uv add</code> is also extremely powerful for adding remote dependencies from git or elsewhere on your computer (but I won’t get into that here.)</p> <h2>Pinning a Python version</h2> <p>Finally, I think that one of the most useful things uv can do is to pin a specific Python version for your project. Doing</p> <pre><!----><code>uv python pin <span>3.12</span>.9</code><!----></pre> <p>would pin the current project to <strong>exactly</strong> Python 3.12.9 for you, and anyone else using uv — meaning that you really can replicate the <strong>exact</strong> same Python install across multiple machines.</p> <h2>uvx: ignore all of the above and just run a tool, now!</h2> <p>But sometimes, you might just want to run a tool quickly — like using Ruff to lint code somewhere, or starting a Jupyter notebook server without an environment, or even just quickly starting an IPython session with pandas installed so you can open up a file. The <code>uv tool</code> command, which has a short alias <code>uvx</code>, makes this insanely easy. Running a command like</p> <pre><!----><code>uvx ruff</code><!----></pre> <p>will automatically download the tool you want to use and run it in a one-off virtual environment. Once the tool has been downloaded before, this is lightning-fast because of how uv uses caches.</p> <p>There are a lot of occasions when I might want to do this — a common one might be to quickly start an IPython session with pandas installed (using <code>--with</code> to add dependencies) so that I can quickly open &amp; look at a parquet file. For instance:</p> <pre><!----><code>uvx <span>--with</span> pandas,pyarrow ipython</code><!----></pre> <p>Or, maybe just starting a Jupyter Lab server so that I can quickly open a Jupyter notebook that a student sent me:</p> <pre><!----><code>uvx jupyter lab</code><!----></pre> <p>Or honestly just so many other weird, one-off use cases where <code>uvx</code> is really nice to have around. <strong>I don’t feel like I’m missing out by always using virtual environments</strong>, because <code>uvx</code> always gives you a ‘get out of jail free’ card whenever you need it.</p> <h2>If that hasn’t sold you: a personal note</h2> <p>I first discovered uv last year, while working together with our other lovely developers on building <a href="https://astrosky.eco/" rel="nofollow">The Astrosky Ecosystem</a> — a wonderful project to build open-source social media integrations for astronomers online. But with multiple developers all working asynchronously on multiple operating systems, managing Python installations quickly became a huge task.</p> <p>uv is an <strong>incredibly powerful simplification</strong> for us that we use across our entire tech stack. As developers, we can all work with identical Python installations, which is especially important given a number of semi-experimental dependencies that we use that have breaking changes with every version. On GitHub Actions, we’re planning to use uv to quickly build a Python environment and run our unit tests. In production, uv already manages Python for all of our servers.</p> <p>It’s just <em>so nice</em> to always know that Python and package installation will <strong>always</strong> be handled <strong>consistently and correctly</strong> across all of our machines. <strong>That’s why uv is the best thing to happen to the Python ecosystem in a decade.</strong></p> <h2>Find out more</h2> <p>There’s a lot more on <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/" rel="nofollow">the uv docs</a>, including a <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/" rel="nofollow">getting started page</a>, more <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/" rel="nofollow">in-depth guides</a>, <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/" rel="nofollow">explanations of important concepts</a>, and <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/" rel="nofollow">a full command reference</a>.</p><!----></article><!----><!--]--><!----></div></div>]]></description>
