      <p>The underwater caves of the Yucatán Peninsula are a window to the distant past. Through two million years and over multiple glaciation cycles, these caves have been transformed. When the sea level was high, the caves flooded, and their reach expanded.</p>

<p>During the ice ages, the caves dried out as the sea level dropped, and the seeping water from the surface decorated the caverns with deposits such as stalagmites and stalactites, collectively known as <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/paleoclimatology/speleothem">speleothems</a>. Then, with the next cycle came higher sea levels again, flooding the caves and preserving in time the speleothems and everything else with them.</p>

<p>I have been diving the unique submerged landscapes of Mexican cenotes, or sinkholes, for almost ten years, exploring their dark, flooded tunnels and capturing their secrets. The last time the shallow caves on the Yucatán Peninsula flooded was around 8,000 years ago, which means that every diver in these caves travels back in time to a prehistoric age. The paleontological and archaeological remains preserved within them would disintegrate at the surface, which makes these caves a perfect time capsule.</p>

<h2>How Mexico’s cenotes came to be</h2>

<p>This underworld is formed by a massive underground aquifer in the northern Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. It is accessible by cenotes that connect the surface of the Earth to the longest underground river systems in the world. Here, water doesn’t accumulate on the surface as rivers, but instead gets absorbed through the porous limestone to flow within underground tunnels. Much as our blood vessels send life-sustaining fluid throughout our bodies, these tunnels convey the precious water that sustains all life in this region. It is no wonder that cenotes were considered sacred by the Maya.</p>

<p>The Maya established their civilization on the Yucatán Peninsula about 4,000 years ago. In order to thrive, they needed to settle close to a freshwater source. All of their largest settlements on the northern part of the peninsula—including the famed Chichén Itzá—were built beside cenotes. During the region’s dry season, cenotes were the only source of water; therefore, the sinkholes were not only a fundamental part of Maya life but also a place for worship and rituals related to rain, life, death and rebirth.</p>

<p>Each Maya <em>d’zonot </em>(the Maya word from which the word cenote comes from) was an entrance to the mystical underworld called Xibalba, where various deities and supernatural beings resided. It is a mysterious and powerful realm associated with death, a portal to a domain where ritualistic offerings honored both the gods and the deceased and sought protection and guidance for the living. Living within, and the protector of this underworld, was Chaac, the god of rain, fertility and agriculture. He was an important deity in Maya mythology, as rain was vital for the success of crops and the well-being of the community.</p>

<p>Beneath the cenotes, deeper in their caves, artifacts and human remains from the Maya civilization have lain undisturbed for centuries and can be seen by explorers. But these are not the only indicators of human presence. While the Maya settled the region only a few thousand years ago, evidence found in the cenotes points to human settlements in the area dating back more than 13,000 years. These finds challenge the accepted notion of when our ancestors first crossed into America via the Bering Land Bridge between Siberia and Alaska during the last ice age.</p>

<p>These ancient hunter-gatherers also depended on the cenotes as a water source, and probably for shelter as well. Back then, the cenotes were much drier, with the water level some 300 feet below current-day levels. The ancient inhabitants had to venture deep into the caves to access the water, crossing paths with huge prehistoric animals from the late Pleistocene—now long extinct—that also sought fresh water.</p>

<h2>Finding Maya artifacts and human remains</h2>

</figure>
<p>It’s challenging to put into words the raw and profound sensation that accompanies encountering a human skull in the darkness of the flooded caves. Long before I recognize a skull as mere remains, I can feel its gaze upon me from the shadows, a haunting presence that defies description. Particularly in the area of the Ring of Cenotes, many sacrificial cenotes hold skulls of the higher-ranking Maya families. Along with modified front teeth to host ornaments, these skulls were artificially deformed to create a physical distinction. The higher-ranking Maya used different techniques to shape their children’s skulls, creating an oblique deformation, which made their heads look longer than the average Maya’s. Said to resemble a jaguar’s head, this shape was a symbol of power. Also rare sightings for cave explorers are sophisticated Maya paintings on cave walls close to the entrances of cenotes. Depicting wars, animals, gods and stories, these treasures can be forever lost once submerged, washed away over time.</p>

<p>Long before the Maya settled in the area, the first Homo sapiens crossed into America over the Bering Land Bridge at least 25,000 years ago. They made their way down to South America and arrived on the Yucatán Peninsula at the end of the last ice age around 13,000 years ago. There they used the caves to extract water and minerals, to find shelter, and to bury their dead. While it is typically hard to find remains of these hunter-gatherers on the surface of the Earth, evidence of early human presence was preserved in these caves from before the last time the caves flooded. That evidence gives us clues to understanding early humans’ biology and even their social interactions.</p>

<p>Within the flooded caves it is common to see purposely broken formations that create passages through the tunnels, and even cairns—made of piles of rocks or broken speleothems—placed at the junctions of tunnels to navigate the intricate cave labyrinths. Early humans also excavated rocks and mined red ocher using only Stone Age tools and their mastery of fire. They used the ocher to decorate objects for personal ornamentation and burials. They also decorated the caves with multiple art forms, from paintings on the walls to sculptures. A well-known example is the figure of a woman at the entrance of Cenote Dos Ojos; while it was not sculpted as such, it is a carefully selected speleothem that resembles the silhouette of a woman and was intentionally exhibited on a pedestal to decorate the cave entrance, evidence of paleoart from more than 8,000 years ago that anyone can visit.</p>

<h2>Diving for fossil evidence of extinct megafauna</h2>

<p>As if they were corridors of a museum, the submerged passageways of these time capsules also offer divers the opportunity to uncover exquisitely preserved fossils of diverse creatures—most of which are now extinct—that once inhabited the Yucatán during the late Pleistocene.</p>

<p>Following the cataclysmic impact of the Chicxulub asteroid 66 million years ago, which marked the end of the dinosaur age, mammals began to dominate the lands once ruled by dinosaurs. Over time, North and South America underwent distinct evolutionary trajectories. However, around 2.7 million years ago, the formation of the Panamanian land bridge facilitated a pivotal event: the Great American Biotic Interchange.</p>

<p>During this exchange, North American fauna migrated southward, including large mammals called megafauna, like saber-toothed cats, lions, gomphotheres (related to modern elephants), horses and camels. Meanwhile, South American megafauna moved northward, including giant ground sloths and glyptodonts (enormous armadillos). This monumental event significantly influenced and sculpted the ecosystems and biodiversity of both continents, affecting the composition of species and ecosystems we see today.</p>

<p>The thrill of exploring the underwater caves of the Yucatán is heightened upon uncovering the fossilized remains of these long-extinct megafauna. Visualizing these colossal creatures coming to life right where you are diving, in what was once a prehistoric cave that had been frozen in time by these waters, is like being teleported back to their era, immersed in a thrilling journey through time. How their fossils came to be submerged underwater can be easily imagined. With the water level during the last ice age up to 300 feet lower than it is today, these animals had to venture down dark, dry cave passages to reach drinking water, sometimes surprisingly far away from an entrance. Trapped in sinkholes or lost within labyrinthine passages, these animals died, and their remains became fossilized and preserved by rising water levels.</p>

<p>Among the many extinct species that lived in this region are members of the family Megalonychidae (including the genus <em>Megalonyx</em>, Greek for “large claw”). Fossils of these giant ground sloths are commonly found in the caves, as they probably took refuge within them, such as members of the genus <em>Xibalbaonyx</em> (“great claw of Xibalba”), a polar bear-sized ground sloth with big claws that measured up to 12 feet in height and weighed nearly a ton. They are joined by members of related families, including the genus <em>Nothrotheriops</em>, a grizzly bear-sized mammal that reached five feet tall and weighed 1,000 pounds.</p>

<p>Representing archaeological and paleontological marvels, the fossils concealed within the caves constitute genuine treasures, allowing for teams of specialized scientists to explore these wonders, aiming to unravel scientific enigmas, construct hypotheses and shed light on the mysteries that shroud our planet’s history.</p>

<h2>Many more mysteries to be solved</h2>

<p>There’s a symbiotic relationship between the passionate and technical cave explorers who investigate every hole in a cave in their free time (and just for fun) and those in the scientific community who want to study these prehistoric materials but cannot reach where they’re hidden in the underwater darkness. This relationship of discovery and research has already provided evidence of many newly discovered extinct species, as well as ancient humans who had vanished for millennia, a relationship that could be fostered even more by leveraging the world-class level of the dive explorers in the area. After all, the majority of these secrets remain yet to be discovered!</p>

<p>The caves also hold evidence that could solve a prehistoric murder mystery. After the Great American Biotic Interchange, these megafauna species coexisted in this region for hundreds of thousands of years and through multiple ice age cycles, until their abrupt extinction more than 10,000 years ago when a new species arrived on the Yucatán Peninsula: Homo sapiens.</p>

<p>After humans arrived in the region, many genera of large mammals became extinct. There are different ways to explain this mass extinction event. One leading hypothesis states that the already reduced populations of those animals, stressed due to the changing climate after the latest ice age, were hunted to extinction by the humans. These big mammals, which needed a long time to become sexually mature and had slow reproduction rates (up to 22 months), were particularly vulnerable to this new threat.</p>

<p>Among the fossils preserved within the flooded caves, I have witnessed many examples indicating that these extinct species had been hunted and eaten by our predecessors, such as preserved megafauna bones exhibiting cut marks from human-made stone tools, the repetitive marks showing the methodical action taken to remove flesh from the bone. Also noted are perforations on fossilized bones inflicted by projectiles, extinct animal remains beside cooking pits with bones in them, organized piles of bones, and burn marks on animal fossils inside the cave. Indications such as these have been found at cave depths that correspond to the time horizon when humans and the now-extinct animals coexisted and within areas that also exhibit indications of the kind of sophisticated social organization required for early humans to hunt these big creatures, like the mining of red ocher.</p>

<p>The hypothesis of the Paleo-Americans overhunting these species to extinction still needs to be validated, but it is undeniable that these caves protect invaluable material for scientists to study, information that will help us understand our past—and hopefully inform our future.</p>

<p>
<a href="https://justine.lol/cosmo3/">Cosmopolitan Libc</a> is well-known for
its <a href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">polyglot fat binary</a> hack
that lets your executables run on six OSes for AMD64 / ARM64. What may
surprise you is that it could also be the best C library for your
production workloads too. To demonstrate this point, let's compare
Cosmo's mutex library with other platforms.

</p><p>
We'll do this by writing a simple test that spawns <strong>30
threads</strong> which increment the same integer <strong>100,000
times</strong>. This tests how well a mutex implementation performs in
the heavily contended use case. In essence, that means the following
(see the segment at the bottom of the page for the full source code).

</p><pre><span>int</span> g_chores;
<span>pthread_mutex_t</span> g_locker = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

<span>void</span> *<span>worker</span>(<span>void</span> *arg) {
  <span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = 0; i &lt; ITERATIONS; ++i) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;g_locker);
    ++g_chores;
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;g_locker);
  }
  <span>return</span> 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
Now let's start with the exciting part, which are my benchmark results.

</p><h3>Benchmarks</h3>

<p>
Times will be measured in microseconds. Wall time is how long the test
program takes to run. That includes the overhead of spawning and joining
threads. User time is how much CPU time was spent in userspace, and
system time is how much CPU time was spent in the kernel. System and
user time can exceed the actual wall time because multiple threads are
running in parallel.

</p><p>
The first results I'll show are for Windows because Mark Waterman did an
excellent <a href="https://github.com/markwaterman/MutexShootout">mutex
shootout</a> three months ago, where he said, "in the highly contended
scenario, Windows wins the day with its SRWLOCK". Contention is where
mutex implementations show their inequality. Mark was so impressed by
Microsoft's SRWLOCK that he went on to recommend Linux and FreeBSD users
consider targeting Windows if mutex contention is an issue.

<p>
As we can see, Cosmopolitan Libc mutexes go 2.75x faster than
Microsoft's SRWLOCK (which was previously believed to be the best of the
best) while consuming 18x fewer CPU resources. Cosmopolitan mutexes were
also 65x faster than Cygwin, which like Cosmopolitan provides a POSIX
implementation on Windows. Cygwin's mutexes are so bad that they would
have been better off for this use case just using a spin lock.

Now onto Linux, the lord of all operating systems.

<p>
  Here we see Cosmopolitan mutexes are:

</p><ul>
<li>3x faster than glibc
</li><li>11x faster than glibc
</li><li>42x less CPU time than glibc
</li><li>178x less CPU time than Musl Libc
</li></ul>

<p>
Here's how things actually work in practice. Imagine you have a workload
where all your threads need to do a serialized operation. With Cosmo, if
you're looking at htop, then it's going to appear like only one core is
active, whereas glibc and musl libc will fill up your entire CPU meter.
That's bad news if you're running a lot of jobs on the same server. If
just one of your servers has a mutex bloodbath, then all your resources
are gone, unless you're using cosmo. It's still a new C library and it's
a little rough around the edges. But it's getting so good, so fast, that
I'm starting to view <em>not</em> using it in production as an
abandonment of professional responsibility. The C library is so deeply
embedded in the software supply chain, and so depended upon, that you
really don't want it to be a planet killer. If essential unquestioned
tools are this wasteful then it's no wonder Amazon Cloud makes such a
fortune.

</p><p>
Last but not least, we have MacOS.

<p>
On MacOS with an M2 ARM64 microprocessor, Apple's Libc slightly
outperforms Cosmopolitan's mutexes. For reasons I do not yet fully
understand, Cosmopolitan's normal mutex implementation doesn't work well
on this platform. It's possibly because the M2 and XNU are in league. So
on MacOS ARM, Cosmopolitan uses a simpler algorithm based on Ulrich
Drepper's
"<a href="https://dept-info.labri.fr/~denis/Enseignement/2008-IR/Articles/01-futex.pdf">Futexes
Are Tricky</a>" paper that basically just farms out all the heavy
lifting to XNU's ulock system calls. That's why performance is nearly
identical to what Apple does.

</p><p>
So in summary, these benchmark results indicate that Cosmopolitan
mutexes, in the best case, will be overwhelmingly better than
alternatives at the contended + tiny critical section use case, and in
the worst case, Cosmopolitan will be roughly as good.

</p><h3>How I Did It</h3>

<p>
The reason why Cosmopolitan Mutexes are so good is because I used a
library called <a href="https://github.com/google/nsync">nsync</a>. It
only has 371 stars on GitHub, but it was written by a distinguished
engineer at Google named Mike Burrows. If you don't know who he is, he's
the guy who coded Google's fiercest competitor, which was Altavista. If
you're not old enough to remember Altavista, it was the first search
engine that was good, and it ran on a single computer.

</p><p>
I've had a lot of fun integrating nsync into Cosmopolitan. I've even
had the opportunity to make upstream contributions. For example, I found
and fixed a bug in his mutex unlock function that had gone undiscovered
for years. I also managed to make contended nsync mutexes go 30% faster
than nsync upstream on AARCH64, by porting it to use C11 atomics. I
wrote new system integration for things like futexes that enable it do
portability at runtime. Lastly I made it work seamlessly with POSIX
thread cancelations.

</p><p>
So how does nsync do it? What are the tricks that it uses? Here's some
of my takes and analysis:

</p><ul>

<li>
nsync uses an optimistic CAS (compare and swap) immediately, so that
locking happens quickly when there's no contention.

</li><li>
When a lock can't be acquired, nsync adds the calling thread to a
doubly linked list of waiters. Each waiter gets its own semaphore on a
separate independent cacheline. This serves an important purpose. Once a
thread enters the wait state, it's no longer touching the main lock. To
understand why that's important, read Ulrich Drepper's paper
"<a href="https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf">What
Every Programmer Should Know About Memory</a>". He goes into great depth
on the coherency protocols used by modern microprocessors, where cores
basically talk to each other under the hood about which cachelines
they're using. When multiple cores touch the same ones, that creates a
lot of communication overhead within the processor.

</li><li>
nsync enlists the help of the operating system by using futexes. This is
a great abstraction invented by Linux some years ago, that quickly found
its way into other OSes. On MacOS, futexes are called ulock. On Windows,
futexes are called <code>WaitOnAddress()</code>. The only OS Cosmo
supports that doesn't have futexes is NetBSD, which implements POSIX
semaphores in kernelspace, and each semaphore sadly requires creating a
new file descriptor. But the important thing about futexes and
semaphores is they allow the OS to put a thread to sleep. That's what
lets nsync avoid consuming CPU time when there's nothing to do.

</li><li>
nsync avoids starvation with this concept of a "long wait". If a waiter
gets woken 30 times and fails to acquire the lock internally every time,
then nsync adds a bit to the lock that prevents threads that haven't
waited yet from acquiring. This means that initial CAS at the beginning
will fail for everyone else until the queue has had some time to clear.

</li><li>
nsync makes the use case we benchmarked go fast (contended lock with a
small critical section) using this concept of a "designated waker". This
bit on the main lock is set when a thread is awake and trying to acquire
the lock. In nsync, the unlock function is what's responsible for waking
the next thread in line waiting for the lock. Having this bit allows the
unlocking thread to know it needn't bother waking a second locker since
one is already awake.

</li></ul>

<p>
To learn more of nsync's secrets, you can read the source code here:
<a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/tree/master/third_party/nsync/mu.c"><code>cosmopolitan/third_party/nsync/mu.c</code></a>.

</p><h3>Online Proof</h3>

<p>
If you want to see a live demo of a piece of software built with Cosmo
mutexes, then do your worst DDOS to the
<a href="http://ipv4.games/">http://ipv4.games/</a> web server. Now this
is truly a game for hackers, competing to dominate the Internet. You're
already playing this game because your IP was just claimed for jart. The
service runs on a GCE VM with 2 cores and so far it's managed to survive
being DDOS'd by botnets as large as 49,131,669 IPs. A lot of that is
thanks to nsync which allowed me to move SQL queries to background
threads which send messages to each other. There are still improvements
to be made, but overall it's held up well. You can even monitor
its <a href="http://ipv4.games/statusz">/statusz</a> health metrics.

         tomicros(ru.ru_stime));
}

</pre>

<p>
The reason we care about the contended case, because that's where mutex
implementations show their inequality. Uncontended mutexes usually
perform the same across implementations, and even then you might be
better off with a spin lock, which only takes a few lines:

</p><pre><span>void</span> <span>spin_lock</span>(<span>atomic_int</span> *lock) {
  if (atomic_exchange_explicit(lock, 1, memory_order_acquire)) {
    <span>for</span> (;;) {
      <span>for</span> (;;)
        <span>if</span> (!atomic_load_explicit(lock, memory_order_relaxed))
          <span>break</span>;
      <span>if</span> (!atomic_exchange_explicit(lock, 1, memory_order_acquire))
        <span>break</span>;
    }
  }
}

<span>void</span> <span>spin_unlock</span>(<span>atomic_int</span> *lock) {
  atomic_store_explicit(lock, 0, memory_order_release);
}
</pre>

<p>
Please note that spin locks should really only be used when you have no
other choice. They're useful in kernels, where extreme low level
constraints disallow anything fancy. Spin locks are also a useful
implementation detail in nsync locks. But overall they're bad. I imagine
many developers believe they're good. If so, it's probably because
they've only benchmarked wall time. With locks, it's important to take
CPU time into consideration too. That's why we use
<code>getrusage()</code>.

<p>What follows is an unusual story of perseverance. We start with a conjecture and after some plot twists  end up discussing the meaning of truth. While the title is a spoiler, you might not be able to guess how we got there…</p>



<h4>The conjecture</h4>



<p>The <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunkbed_conjecture">bunkbed conjecture</a></em></strong> (BBC) is a basic claim about random subgraphs. Start with a finite graph <em><strong>G</strong></em><strong>=(<em>V</em>,<em>E</em>)</strong> and consider a product graph <strong><em>G</em> <em>x</em> <em>K</em><sub>2</sub></strong> obtained by connecting the corresponding vertices on levels <strong><em>V</em><sup>(1)</sup></strong> and <strong><em>V</em><sup>(2)</sup></strong>.  Sort of like a <a href="https://i.etsystatic.com/22453533/r/il/81fe4f/3189746867/il_1588xN.3189746867_dodu.jpg">bunkbed</a>.  Now consider random subgraphs of a this product graph.  </p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><mark>Bunkbed Conjecture:</mark></strong>  The probability that vertices <em><strong>u</strong></em><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup> and <em><strong>v</strong></em><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup> are connected is greater or equal than the probability that vertices <em><strong>u</strong></em><sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup> and <strong><em>v</em></strong><sup><strong>(2)</strong></sup> are connected.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In other words, the probability of connecting two vertices on the same level cannot be smaller than when connect vertices on different levels. This is completely obvious, of course! And yet the conjecture this problem defeated several generations of probabilists and remained open until now. For a good reason, of course. It was <em><a href="https://as1.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/04/87/13/32/1000_F_487133220_dPDd98wC3pFZcHxs4wfEnZYDAO4wDqLd.jpg">false</a></em>!</p>



<p>The origins of the conjecture are murky, but according to <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2652916">van den Berg and Kahn</a> it was conjectured by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Kasteleyn">Kasteleyn </a>in the early 1980s. There are many versions of this conjecture; notably one can condition on the subset of vertical edges and ask the same question. Many partial results are known, as well as results for other probabilistic models. The conjecture is <em><strong><mark>false</mark></strong></em> nonetheless!</p>



<h4>The direction</h4>



<p>Why look for a counterexample if the conjecture is so obviously true?  Well, because you always should.  For any conjecture.  Especially if everyone else is so <em><strong>sure</strong></em>, as in <em>completely absolutely sure without a doubt</em>, that the conjecture is true.  <strong><em><mark>What if they are all wrong?</mark></em></strong>  I discuss this at length in <a href="https://wp.me/p211iQ-uT">this blog post</a>, so there is no need to rehash this point.  </p>



<h4>The counterexample</h4>



<p>We disprove the conjecture in a<strong> <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/papers/BunkBed4.pdf">joint paper</a></strong> with <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~gladkovna/">Nikita Gladkov</a> (UCLA) and <a href="https://web.mit.edu/azimin/www/">Alexandr Zimin</a> (MIT), both graduate students.  Roughly speaking we take the following 3-hypergraph from a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01790">recent paper</a> by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PabtgaQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Hollom</a>.  </p>



<figure><a href="https://igorpak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hollom-graph.png"><img data-attachment-id="3238" data-permalink="https://igorpak.wordpress.com/2024/10/01/the-bunkbed-conjecture-is-false/hollom-graph/" data-orig-file="https://igorpak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hollom-graph.png" data-orig-size="1043,1326" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Hollom-graph" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://igorpak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hollom-graph.png?w=236" data-large-file="https://igorpak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hollom-graph.png?w=595" tabindex="0" role="button" width="805" height="1023" src="https://igorpak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hollom-graph.png?w=805" alt=""></a></figure>



<p>We then replace each yellow triangle with the following gadget using <em>n</em>=1204, placing <em>a</em> in the shaded vertex, while <em><strong>v</strong></em><sub><strong>1</strong></sub> and <em><strong>v</strong></em><sub><strong>n</strong></sub> are placed in the other vertices of the triangle (so the red path goes into the red path).  For a stronger version of the conjecture that’s all there is.  For a weaker version, some additional tweaks needed to be made (they are not so important).  And we are done!  </p>



<figure><a href="https://igorpak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image.png"><img data-attachment-id="3242" data-permalink="https://igorpak.wordpress.com/2024/10/01/the-bunkbed-conjecture-is-false/image-14/" data-orig-file="https://igorpak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image.png" data-orig-size="799,436" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://igorpak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://igorpak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image.png?w=595" tabindex="0" role="button" width="799" height="436" src="https://igorpak.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image.png?w=799" alt=""></a></figure>



<p>The resulting graph is has 7523 vertices and 15654 edges.   The difference between probabilities for paths between <strong><em>u</em><sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong><em>u</em><sub>10</sub></strong> at the same and different levels as in the conjecture is astronomically small, on the order of -10<sup>-6500</sup>.  But it’s negative, which is all we need.  Very very roughly speaking, the red path is the only path which avoids shaded vertices and creates a certain bias which give this probability gap.  Formalizing this is a bit technical.  </p>



<h4>The experiments</h4>



<p>Of course, the obvious way to verify our counterexample computationally would fail miserably — the graph is much too large.  Instead, we give a relatively elementary completely combinatorial disproof of the BBC that is accessible to a wide audience.  I would rather not rehash technical details and ideas in the proof — it’s all in <strong><a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/papers/BunkBed4.pdf">our paper</a></strong>, which is only 12 pages!   See also the <a href="https://github.com/Kroneckera/bunkbed-counterexample">GitHub code</a> and some <a href="https://web.mit.edu/azimin/www/notebooks/bunkbed_counterexample.html">explanation</a>. </p>



<p>I do want to mention that giving formal disproof was not our first choice.  It’s what we ended up doing after many failures.  There is always a bit of a stigma people have about publicly discussing their failures.  I know very few examples, only <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/549797884/How-Not-to-Prove-Poincare-Conjecture">this one</a> famous enough to be mentioned.   So let me mention briefly how we failed.  </p>



<p>Since I was sure the bunkbed conjecture is false (for reasons somewhat different from my contrarian philosophy), we started with a myriad of computer experiments trying all small graphs.  When those failed, we tried to use AI and other computer assisted tools.  We burned many hours on a giant <em><a href="https://www.hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu/">UCLA Hoffman2 Cluster</a></em> getting closer for a while.  In hindsight, we didn’t look in the right place, obviously.  After several months of computer experiments and no clear counterexample, it felt we are wasting time.  We then thought a bit more about philosophy of what we are doing and stopped.  </p>



<p>Before I tell you why we stopped, let me make a <strong>general recommendation</strong>.  Please do try computer experiments for whatever you are working on.  Make an effort to think it through and design a good experiment.  Work hard to test as much as your computer technology allows.  If you need some computing power, ask around.  Your university might just have the resources.  Occasionally, you can even <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/120867366">ask a private company</a> to donate theirs.  </p>



<p>If you succeed, write a paper and publish it.  Make your code and work notes publicly available.  If you fail, do exactly the same.  If the journals refuse to publish your paper, just keep it on the arXiv.  Other people in your area would want to know.  And as far as the NSF is concerned, all of this is “work product”.  You can’t change the nature of the problem and the results you are getting, but you deserve the credit regardless.  </p>



<p><strong>Let me repeat:</strong> Do not fear telling other you have not succeeded in your computer testing.  Fear others making the same mistakes or repeating the same work that you did.</p>



<h4>The curse</h4>



<p>One reason we stopped is because in our initial rush to testing we failed to contemplate the implications of Monte Carlo testing of even moderately large graphs.  Here is a quote from the paper:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Suppose we did find a potential counterexample graph with only <em>m</em>=100 edges and the probability gap was large enough to be statistically detectable. Since analyzing all of 2<sup>m</sup> ≈ 10<sup>30</sup> subgraphs is not feasible, our Monte Carlo simulations could only confirm the desired inequality with high probability. While this probability could be amplified by repeated testing, one could never formally disprove the bunkbed conjecture this way, of course. </p>



<p><br>This raises somewhat uncomfortable questions whether the mathematical community is ready to live with an uncertainty over validity of formal claims that are only known with high probability. It is also unclear whether in this imaginary world the granting agencies would be willing to support costly computational projects to further increase such probabilities (cf. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03543">Garrabrant+’16</a>], [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9301202">Zeilberger’93</a>]). Fortunately, our failed computational effort avoided this dystopian reality, and we were able to disprove the bunkbed conjecture by a formal argument.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Societal implications aside, it is an interesting question whether a reputable math journal <em>should </em>accept a counterexample that is tested with 99.99% confidence, and the results can be replicated and rechecked by others.  Five sigma may be a <a href="https://home.cern/resources/faqs/five-sigma">gold standard</a> in nuclear physics, but math journals tend to prefer 100% correctness (even though <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/02/13/journal-retracts-paper-state-senator-former-mathematician/">some papers</a> they publish are 100% incorrect).  </p>



<p>What I <em>do know</em>, is that most journals would refuse to even <em>consider</em> a “five sigma counterexample”.  While details of the situations differ quite a bit, I knew <a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/Opinion121.html">what happened</a> to the (rather interesting) Sills–Zeilberger paper, which was <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10236198.2012.678837">eventually published</a>, but not after several desk rejections.  But PhD students need jobs in reality, not in theory.  That is really why we stopped.  Why persevere and create controversy when you can just try doing something else?  </p>



<p><strong>P.S.</strong> There is yet another layer to all of this. Back in 1999, I asked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avi_Wigderson">Avi Wigderson</a> if <strong>P=BPP</strong>? He said “<em>Yes</em>“. Last week I asked him again. This is 25 years later, almost to the day. He said “<em>Yes, I am absolutely sure of that</em>.” It’s one of his <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-turing-award-winner-everything-is-computation-and-some-problems-are-unsolvable/">favorite conjectures</a>, of course. If he is right, every probabilistic counterexample can be turned into deterministic. In other words, there would be a fully rigorous way to estimate both probabilities and prove on a computer that the conjecture is false. But you must have guessed what I was thinking when I heard what he said — now he used “<em>absolutely sure</em>“…</p>

Tik has no sounds or visuals, meaning you can play it anytime, anywhere! Just hold your phone in your hand, whether it be under a desk or in your pocket, and tap away! Because Tik uses haptic feedback (the thing your phone does when you make a purchase, or hold the send button in iMessages for a couple seconds) in order to provide interactive, immersive gameplay, there's no need to ever look at the screen or hear anything!</p><p>OK. SO HOW DOES TIK WORK?<br>You will feel a series of 5 to 8 “Tiks” (haptic vibrations). Then, try to copy the rhythm of the sequence by tapping it anywhere on the screen. If the timing of your taps is close enough, you win! If not, Tik will replay the sequence so you can try again.</p><p>THIS SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!<br>It Is! Well, almost, because it is true! Download Tik today and say goodbye to mundane meetings and boring presentations forever!</p><p>HAVE A QUESTION?<br>We would love to hear it! Please reach out to us at freestyle.feedback@gmail.com</p><p>(One more thing. We realize that Tik may be accessible to those with certain disabilities since the game relies solely on haptic feedback.

<p>This is the video recording of my talk with this title, done at February 4, 2024 10:00 in the K1.105 room at FOSDEM 2024. The room can hold some 800 people but there were a few hundred seats still unoccupied. Several people I met up with later have insisted that 10 am on a Sunday is way too early for attending talks…</p>



<p>When I was about to start my talk, the slides would not show on the projector. Yeah, sigh. Nothing surprising maybe, but you always hope you can avoid these problems – in particular in the last moment with a huge audience waiting.</p>



<p>There was this separate video monitor laptop that clearly showed that my laptop would output the correct thing – in a proper resolution (1280 x 720 as per auto-negotiation), but the projector refused to play ball. The live stream could also see my output, so the problem was somehow from the video box to the projector.</p>



<p>Several people eventually got involved, things were rebooted multiple times, cables were yanked and replugged in again. First after I installed <a href="https://christian.amsuess.com/tools/arandr/">arandr</a> and forced-updated the resolution of my HDMI output to 1920×1080  the projector would suddenly show my presentation. (Later on I was told that people had <em>the same</em> problem in this room the day before…)</p>



<p>That was about nine minutes of technical difficulties that is cut out from the recording. Nine minutes to test my nerves and presentation finesse as I had to adapt.</p>

<p>One of the many lies in <a href="https://wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cease-and-Desist-Letter-to-Automattic-and-Request-to-Preserve-Documents-Sent.pdf">Silver Lake and WP Engine’s C&amp;D</a> was their claim that Automattic demanded money from them moments before our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnI-QcVSwMU&amp;t=149s">CEO Matt Mullenweg gave his keynote at WordCamp US</a>. </p>



<p>That is not true. Automattic asked for a verbal agreement that WP Engine would give some percentage of their revenue back into WordPress, either in the form of a trademark agreement or employee hours spent on core WordPress.</p>



<p>For transparency, <a href="https://automattic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/term-sheet-wp-engine-inc.-automattic-trademark-license_09.19.2024-1.pdf">Automattic is publishing the full term sheet</a> WP Engine was offered on September 20<sup>th</sup>. Given WP Engine’s behavior, deception, and incompetence since September 20<sup>th</sup> these terms are no longer sufficient.</p>



<p>Lee Wittlinger and Heather Brunner had ample time to resolve this conflict. In an effort to continue our transparency, here are some of the meetings we’ve had with WP Engine over the past 20 months:</p>



<p><strong>February 2023</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>February 23: Matt Mullenweg (Automattic CEO) and Heather Brunner (WP Engine CEO) meet for lunch at Eunice Restaurant in Houston.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>March 2023</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>March 21: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKHY6QPnclQ">Matt and Matías Ventura (WP’s Chief Architect) speak at WP Engine’s DE{CODE} conference</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>November 2023</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>November 28: Matt and Heather Brunner speak via phone.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>January 2024</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>January 26: Matt and Heather Brunner meet via Zoom.</li>



<li>January 28: Matt, Toni Schneider, and Heather Brunner meet via Zoom. Matt was <a href="https://ma.tt/2024/02/samattical/">heading out on sabbatical</a> and Toni would be continuing discussions as Automattic’s interim CEO.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>February 2024</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>February 5: Toni and Heather Brunner discuss trademarks and commercial agreement.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>March 2024</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>March 22: Toni and Paul Maiorana from Automattic meet with Heather, Ezinne Udezue, and Ramadass Prabhakar from WP Engine.</li>



<li>March 29: Toni and Heather Brunner discuss agreement terms via email.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>May 2024</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>May 30: Automattic shares first term sheet with WP Engine via email.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>June 2024</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>June 12: Steve Deckert from Automattic meets with Victor Yuan, Carl Hargraves, Ezinne Udezue, and Ramadass Prabhakar from WP Engine.</li>



<li>June 26: Steve follows up with Victor Yuan. Victor requests a call.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>July 2024</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>July 3:&nbsp;Steve and Jesse Friedman from Automattic meet via Zoom with Victor Yuan from WP Engine to review the terms a second time.</li>



<li>July 16: Steve follows up with Victor Yuan, expressing concern about the timeline.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>September 2024</strong> </p>



<ul>
<li>September 17: Mark Davies (Automattic CFO) and Lee Wittlinger (Silver Lake managing director and WP Engine board member) meet via Zoom.</li>



<li>September 19: Mark and Lee Wittlinger meet via Zoom.</li>



<li>September 20: Mark and Lee Wittlinger meet by Zoom.</li>
</ul>



<p>On September 19 and 20, Lee Wittlinger and Heather Brunner did not answer any of Matt’s calls.</p>
