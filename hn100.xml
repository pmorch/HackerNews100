        <p>A few days into making One Million Checkboxes I thought I’d been hacked. What was <em>that</em> doing in my database?</p>

<p>A few hours later I was tearing up, proud of some brilliant teens.</p>

<p>But let’s back up.</p>

<p><em>Note - I’m trying something new; I’ve also made a <a href="https://youtu.be/OI4DbECnp8A">YouTube video</a> that tells this story. I’m trying to decide whether I’m interested in making videos; check it out if you’d like!</em>
<!-- excerpt-end --></p>
<h2 id="what-was-one-million-checkboxes">What was One Million Checkboxes?</h2>
<p>On June 26th 2024, I <a href="https://eieio.games/nonsense/game-14-one-million-checkboxes/">launched a website</a> called One Million Checkboxes (OMCB). It had one million <em>global</em> checkboxes on it - checking (or unchecking) a box changed it for everyone on the site, instantly.</p>

<div>
    
    
    <video playsinline="" controls="" muted="" poster="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/30mins-activity-firstframe.png">
    
        <source src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/30mins-activity.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    
    <p> The site, 30 minutes after launch </p>
    
</div>

<p>My expectations for the site were very low and very wrong. I thought hundreds of players would check thousands of boxes - instead, 500,000 players checked over 650,000,000 boxes in the two weeks that I kept the site online. The site made it into the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/style/one-million-checkboxes-game.html">New York Times</a> and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/02/one-million-checkboxes-pointless-fun/">Washington Post</a>; it’s on <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/one-million-checkboxes">Know Your Meme</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Million_Checkboxes">Wikipedia</a>. The whole thing was a wild ride.</p>

<p><a href="https://eieio.games/essays/scaling-one-million-checkboxes/">A separate blog of mine</a> covers the technical details behind OMCB. This blog covers my favorite story from running the site.</p>

<p>But to tell you that story, I need to give you two bits of context.</p>

<h2 id="bit-of-context-1-omcb-made-it-hard-to-draw">Bit of context 1: OMCB made it hard to draw</h2>
<p>I like to make games that help people interact on the internet. Some people are assholes when they interact on the internet. So when I make <a href="https://eieio.games/nonsense/game-12-stranger-video/">games</a> like <a href="https://eieio.games/nonsense/game-13-talk-paper-scissors/">this</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I try to add constraints to make the average interaction a little more pleasant.</p>

<p>I’ve been around long enough to know what people will draw if you put an unrestricted canvas on the public internet, so for OMCB I wanted to constrain drawing.</p>

<p>To do this I scaled the number of checkboxes in a row to the size of the browser window. Here’s what that looks like in practice:</p>

<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/omcb-window-example.gif" alt="The text 'EXAMPLE' is written using checkboxes. The message disappears unless the browser window is fully stretched out.">
</p>
<p>excuse the kerning</p>

<p>Here I’ve written “EXAMPLE” - but you can only see it if the browser is exactly the right width! As soon as the number of checkboxes in a row changes the message disappears.</p>

<p>This meant that if you drew something rude on your phone it wouldn’t show up for me on my laptop and vice-versa: your graffiti was only visible to people with the exact same display as your own. This constraint was particularly nice because it was subtle; you might never realize that your writing wasn’t visible to anyone else on the site!</p>

<p>I got a <em>lot</em> of comments asking for me to “fix” this so that people could draw. But the choice here was very intentional.</p>

<p>I’ve found that the best stories from my stranger-interaction games come from how people work around the constraints that I add.</p>

<p>That was foreshadowing.</p>

<h2 id="bit-of-context-2-how-i-stored-state">Bit of context 2: how I stored state</h2>
<p>OMCB had a million checkboxes on it. One million is a big number! So I wanted to store and transmit my state efficiently.</p>

<p>To do this I said - a checkbox has two valid states. It’s checked or it’s unchecked. That’s like a bit - a bit is either 0 or 1. So I just stored the state for each checkbox as a bit. Bit 3 was “1” if checkbox 3 was checked and “0” otherwise.</p>

<p>That’s a million bits. There are 8 bits in a byte, so that’s 125,000 bytes, which is 125KB - not even the size of an MP3! Totally workable.</p>

<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/binary-encoding.png" alt="An example of how data was stored. Checked boxes are stored as 1s, unchecked boxes as 0s.">
</p>
<p>checked boxes are 1s, unchecked boxes are 0s</p>

<p>I stored this data in Redis (an easy to use database) and base64-encoded<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> it when transmitting it to clients.</p>

<p>I promise this matters. Let’s get back to the story.</p>

<h2 id="have-i-been-hacked">Have I been hacked?</h2>
<p>A few days after launching OMCB, I rewrote the backend in go (with the help of my friend <a href="https://github.com/EliotHedeman">Eliot</a>) to keep up with the load. And then, for some reason, I dumped an ascii encoding of the raw bytes in my database. I don’t know why - I just did it.</p>

<p>The data I saw looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/catgirls1.png" alt="raw binary data from the OMCB database. The url 'https://catgirls.win/omcb' repeatedly shows up">
</p>
<p>what in the world</p>

<p>And my reaction to the data looked something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/am-i-hacked.png" alt="The same image as above, with 'what the fuck, am I hacked' on it">
</p>
<p>sheer terror</p>

<p>I panicked. There were URLs in my database! There were URLs pointing to <em>catgirls.win</em> in my database!! Something was very very wrong.</p>

<p>I assumed I’d been hacked. I poured over my logs, looking for evidence of an intrusion. I read and re-read my code, searching for how somebody could be stuffing strings into a database that should have just contained 0s and 1s.</p>

<p>I couldn’t find anything. My access logs looked fine. My (very simple) code was ok. My heart rate increased. My girlfriend patiently waited for me to join her for dinner. And then - wait.</p>

<p>Wait!</p>

<p>I saw it.</p>


<p>I looked at the checkboxes that corresponded to the sketchy URLs in my database.</p>

<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/corresponding.png" alt="An arrow pointing from the 'h' in https://catgirls.win/omcb to the 8 checkboxes on the website that comprise the byte that represents that h">
</p>
<p>the "h" is one byte - 8 bits. 8 checkboxes. those 8 checkboxes</p>
<p>That H - it represented one byte. One byte represented 8 bits. <em>8 bits represented 8 checkboxes.</em></p>

<p>Those chunks of 8 checkboxes formed a repeating pattern that lined up with the URLs. And if I changed something - if I unchecked a box - the pattern immediately reappeared.</p>
<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/pattern.gif" alt="A repeating pattern of checkboxes. When the user unchecks some boxes the boxes are immediately re-checked">
</p>
<p>spooky</p>

<p>I hadn’t been hacked.</p>

<p><em>Someone was writing me a message in binary.</em></p>

<h3 id="what-does-that-mean">What does that mean?</h3>
<p>When I dumped my database, redis converted the data to ascii.</p>

<p>To do that, it read the data one byte - 8 bits - at a time. It converted that byte to a number between 0 and 255 (2^8 - 1). And then it checked whether that number was in the printable ascii character range (32 - 127). If it was, it printed out the corresponding character; otherwise it printed the byte’s hex representation (e.g. <code>\x00</code> for <code>0</code>).</p>

<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/binary-explanation.png" alt="8 checkboxes and their binary representation. Checkboxes forming the pattern 01101000 represent an h, checkboxes forming the pattern 01110100 represent a t.">
        <img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/asciitable.gif" alt="an ascii table">
</p>
<p>104 represents an 'h' and '116' represents a 't'</p>

<p>So someone was:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Checking boxes</li>
  <li>To flip bits</li>
  <li>To form numbers</li>
  <li>That formed letters</li>
  <li>That spelled out the URL</li>
</ul>

<p>And they were doing it with <em>thousands of other people on the site.</em></p>

<p>I was impressed.</p>

<h2 id="down-the-rabbit-hole">Down the rabbit hole</h2>
<p>So.</p>

<p><code>https://catgirls.win/omcb</code></p>

<p><em>catgirls dot win</em></p>

<p>I hemmed and hawed. I googled around. And then I clicked the link.</p>
<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/invite.png" alt="An invite to a discord called 'Checking Boxes'">
</p>
<p>interesting</p>

<p>The link went to a discord! And the discord was called “Checking Boxes”<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. I joined the discord.</p>
<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/discord-join.png" alt="Discord chat logs. Nolen says 'hi, i made the website.' Someone else says 'WHOA, YES, ITS YOU'">
</p>
<p>saying hello</p>

<p>And someone was really excited to see me! We chatted for a bit. And then they asked me something that blew my mind:</p>

<p>"Have you seen your checkboxes as a 1000x1000 image yet?"</p>

<p>I said no. They showed me what they were up to:</p>

<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/og-grid.png" alt="A black and white grid. There is a banner on the grid that spells out 'be gay do crime' as well as a QR code.">
</p>
<p>goodness</p>

<p>They were downloading data for all million checkboxes and rendering them as a 1000x1000 grid (the unchecked boxes are white; the checked boxes are black).</p>

<p>There’s a lot going on here! We’ve got “be gay do crime” - love that - but there’s some interesting technical stuff here too.</p>

<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/annotated-grid.png" alt="An annotated version of the same grid">
</p>
<p>double goodness</p>

<p>The repeated noise at the bottom is the binary message I found. Above that is a base64 version of the same message - remember that base64 is what I used for transport. And on the left side is a QR code (with full error correction!). All of these messages linked to the discord.</p>

<p>The discord was full of some very sharp teens<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, and they were writing these secret messages to gather other very sharp teens to talk about botting the site. Anyone who was writing a bot would probably be looking at either the base64’d version of the data, the binary version, or the the 1000x1000 image version; they were covering all the bases.</p>

<p>And this worked! The discord grew from under 20 people when I joined to over 60 by the time I shut the site down.</p>

<h2 id="so-whatd-they-do">So what’d they do?</h2>
<p>Well, they drew a whole lot! As they built better systems for drawing (and better reverse-engineered my rate limits<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>) their drawings became more complex.</p>

<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/drawing-bsod.png" alt="A drawing of a windows blue screen of death on one million checkboxes">
</p>
<p>A windows blue screen of death - pre CrowdStrike incident!</p>

<p>Over time they experimented with animations and even tried out some protocols for adding color - like treating adjacent cells as the red, green, and blue channels of a color and drawing to a smaller grid.</p>

<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/drawing-fullgrid.gif" alt="Lots of drawings on one million checkboxes, including several of Jake Gyllenhaal">
</p>
<p>The grid at its most chaotic - someone was a Jake Gyllenhaal fan.</p>

<p>I gave the discord a warning before I sunset the site. The night before doing it I removed all my rate limits to see how much traffic the site could handle and what they could do. We ended up with some really cool animations - my favorite was a Rickroll (this clip is not sped up).</p>
<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/drawing-rickroll.gif" alt="An animated rickroll drawn on one million checkboxes">
</p>
<p>Look at Rick go</p>

<h2 id="is-botting-good">Is botting good?</h2>
<p>Lots of people were mad about bots on OMCB. I’m not going to link to anything here - I don’t want to direct negative attention at anyone - but I got hundreds of messages about bots. The most popular tweet about OMCB complained about bots. People…did not like bots.</p>

<p>And I get it! The typical ways that folks - especially folks who don’t program - bump into bots are things like ticket scalping and restaurant reservation bots. Bots that feel selfish and unfair and antisocial.</p>

<p>And there certainly was botting that you could call antisocial. Folks wrote tiny javascript boxes to uncheck every box that they could - I know this because they excitedly told me.</p>

<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/reddit-comment.png" alt="a reddit comment from a user sharing a script with me">
</p>
<p>ok!</p>

<p>I expected this - I’m a programmer! - but people told me that it ruined the site for them and I suppose I understand that.</p>

<p>So, sure. This drawing probably degraded the experience for “regular” users - although the botters did have some rules around where to bot, and I would occasionally chime in to ask them to dial things down.</p>

<p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/omcb-binary/wapo.png" alt="A message from me asking for folks to tone down botting because OMCB is in the Washington Post">
</p>
<p>debatable how well this worked</p>

<p>So there are some caveats. I understand why people don’t like bots; maybe this wasn’t an unassailable good. But man…</p>

<h2 id="i-found-this-so-moving">I found this so moving!</h2>

<p>In highschool, I wrote a recursive mail rule that sent a friend of mine millions of messages as a joke. I (accidentally!) repeatedly crashed the school’s mail server<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>The adults in my life<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> were largely not mad at me. They asked me to knock it off, but also made me a t-shirt. <em>I don’t think I’d be doing what I do now without the encouragement that I received then.</em></p>

<p>What this discord did was so cool - so surprising - so creative. It reminded me of me - expect they were 10 times the developer I was then (and frankly, better developers than I am now). Getting to watch it live - getting to provide some encouragement, to see what they were doing and respond with praise and pride instead of anger - was deeply meaningful to me. I still tear up when I think about it.</p>

<p>I’m proud to have made something that this discord decided was worth playing with, and I’m even more proud of what they did with it.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to see what they go on to make.</p>

<p><em>Again - I’ve made my <a href="https://youtu.be/OI4DbECnp8A">first YouTube video</a> to tell this story. Given how emotional I found the whole thing, I thought being able to use my voice would be nice. Check it out if you’re interested!</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id=""><p><em>[D.N.A]</em> Elasticsearch and Kibana can be called Open Source again. It is hard to express how happy this statement makes me. Literally jumping up and down with excitement here. All of us at Elastic are. Open source is in my DNA. It is in Elastic DNA. Being able to call Elasticsearch Open Source again is pure joy.</p><p><em>[LOVE.]</em> The tl;dr is that we will be adding AGPL as another license option next to ELv2 and SSPL in the coming weeks. We never stopped believing and behaving like an open source community after we changed the license. But being able to use the term Open Source, by using AGPL, an OSI approved license, removes any questions, or fud, people might have.</p><p><em>[Not Like Us]</em> We never stopped believing in Open Source at Elastic. I never stopped believing in Open Source. I’m going on 25 years and counting as a true believer. So why the change 3 years ago? We had <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-aws" target="_self">issues with AWS</a> and the market confusion their offering was causing. So after trying all the other options we could think of, we changed the license, knowing it would result in a fork of Elasticsearch with a different name and a different trajectory. It’s a long story.</p><p><em>[Like That]</em> The good news is that while it was painful, it worked. 3 years later, Amazon is fully invested in their fork, the market confusion has been (mostly) resolved, and our partnership with AWS is stronger than ever. We were even named AWS partner of the year. I had always hoped that enough time would pass that we could feel safe to get back to being an Open Source project - and it finally has.</p><p><em>[All The Stars]</em> We want to make the life of our users as simple as possible. We have people that really like ELv2 (a BSD inspired license). We have people that have SSPL approved (through MongoDB using it). Which is why we are simply <strong>adding another option, and not removing anything</strong>. If you already use and enjoy Elasticsearch, please carry on, nothing changed. For others, you now have the option to choose AGPL as well.</p><p><em>[LOYALTY.]</em> We chose AGPL, vs another license, because we hope our work with OSI will help to have more options in the Open Source licensing world. And it seems like another OSI approved license will rhyme with SSPL and/or AGPL. Heck, maybe AGPL is enough for infrastructure software like us with how things have progressed since we had to change the license (for example, Grafana who moved to it from Apache2). We are committed to figure it out.</p><p><em>[euphoria]</em> I am so happy to be able to call Elasticsearch Open Source again.</p><p><em>[Alright]</em> With any change, there can be confusion, and, of course, there can be trolls. (Aren’t there always trolls?) Let’s have some fun and try to answer some of these.. Here are some I can imagine, but let’s keep adding to this.</p><ul><li>“Changing the license was a mistake, and Elastic now backtracks from it”. We removed a lot of market confusion when we changed our license 3 years ago. And because of our actions, a lot has changed. It’s an entirely different landscape now. We aren’t living in the past. We want to build a better future for our users. It’s because we took action then, that we are in a position to take action now.</li><li>“AGPL is not true open source, license X is”: AGPL is an OSI approved license, and it's a widely adopted one. For example, MongoDB used to be AGPL and Grafana is AGPL. It shows that AGPL doesn’t affect usage or popularity. We chose AGPL because we believe it’s the best way to start to pave a path, with OSI, towards more Open Source in the world, not less.</li><li>“Elastic changes the license because they are not doing well” - I will start by saying that I am as excited today as ever about the future of Elastic. I am tremendously proud of our products and our team's execution. We shipped Stateless Elasticsearch, ES|QL, and tons of vector database/hybrid search improvements for GenAI use cases. We are leaning heavily into OTel in logging and Observability. And our SIEM product in Security keeps adding amazing features and it's one of the fastest growing in the market. Users' response has been humbling. The stock market will have its ups and downs. What I can assure you, is that we are always thinking long term, and this change is part of it.</li></ul><p>If we see more, we will add them above to hopefully reduce confusion.</p><p><em>[HUMBLE.]</em> It’s so exciting to build for the future. Elasticsearch is back to being Open Source. Yay! What a wonderful thing to say. What a wonderful day.</p><p>Forever :elasticheart: <img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt55b1ec79ff67529a/66d0cd939d291d1b0fcd8171/elasticheart.svg" alt="elasticheart.svg" height="24" width="24"> Open Source<br>Shay</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
            <p>Google search is in the news. Judge Amit Mehta <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25032745-045110819896">ruled</a> that Google search is a monopoly and is behaving in a manner that suppresses search competition with their distribution agreements. The debate on this has started, and various experts have presented pros and cons on the arguments, along with proposed remedies. We will analyze the extremely complex nature of this case and propose a novel remedy that goes into the heart of what we believe the Sherman Act is trying to achieve.</p>

<p>Before diving into the ruling, it’s important to note that while we (the authors) are not lawyers or experts on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act">Sherman Act</a>, we have extensive experience in the tech industry and understand how technology and technology products are used.</p>

<p>And for those unfamiliar with Kagi, a brief disclaimer: We are a new participant in the search market, with <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi Search</a>, a search engine with a distinctive search experience that aligns the interests of users and the search provider. Additionally, we want to address a potential conflict of interest upfront: our proposal would benefit Kagi, but it would also create healthy, true and intense competition in the search space, including to Kagi, which aligns with our understanding of the Sherman Act’s intent.</p>

<p>What follows is written in good faith and with the utmost respect for the technology Google has developed and the talented individuals behind it. We acknowledge Google’s significant contributions: continuous investment in improving search technology, free access to search for billions of users, and innovations that have benefited the entire internet ecosystem. Our disagreement lies solely with the business model and its fit in today’s world. While the ad-based model for search has successfully delivered this service to the masses, the time has come to explore alternative business models that better align with user interests and emerging concepts of core data ownership. It is becoming increasingly evident that search results influenced by third-party interests, rather than consumer needs, are at best ‘for entertainment purposes’ and at worst harmful to consumers - an argument we will explore in more detail.</p>

<p>Our position is that the real harm to users does not stem from a lack of choice in search access, but rather from the lack of choice in search experiences themselves.  Introducing a variety of search experiences would empower users to choose the one that best aligns with their needs, privacy concerns, and expectations, ultimately leading to a healthier and more competitive search market.</p>

<p>Lets explore the main components of this case in more detail.</p>

<h3>Overview of Google architecture</h3>

<p>Here’s a simplified version of the Google architecture (click to enlarge):</p>

<p><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-08-29/1724948708-466940-upload-9c29e3f7d079703db20d81f0ff471fa3.png"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-08-29/1724948708-466940-upload-9c29e3f7d079703db20d81f0ff471fa3.png" alt="Google architecture"></a></p>

<p>Google has innovated on three core aspects of search:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Search Index</li>
<li>The User Index</li>
<li>The Advertiser Index</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s examine each in more detail.</p>

<h4>The Search Index</h4>

<p>Google has built a massive index of the internet that covers close to 100% of the accessible web. Over the years, Google has smartly invested not only in indexing the web but also in building intelligence to determine which “pages” have more relevant data for the user using algorithms.</p>

<p>These include: a) ranking webpages in terms of relevance (like PageRank™, which was patented but has since expired), b) speeding up crawling by embedding “free” code in websites to make them crawler-friendly, and c) ensuring self-validation of websites by asking webmasters to register their websites in the Google Search Console, verifying domain ownership. All these actions and reinforcements make the Google Index the best in the world and an indispensable resource for Google’s search business.</p>

<p>This makes the Search Index a very valuable asset that no other company has in its full complexity and size. For perspective, the Google Search Index is estimated to be over 20 trillion webpages and 12.5 Petabytes (125 million Gigabytes) in size.</p>

<h4>The User Index</h4>

<p>The search engine bar/page is what the consumer or user sees when they start a search query. Google has innovated on the search bar/page by discerning search query intent, providing search query alternatives, location-based search queries, and search query presentation. Once the user enters a search query, Google uses the search index to present results based on what their algorithm anticipates the user wants to see, both for commercial and non-commercial queries. Additionally, the search page also shows ads, which is how Google monetizes their search business.</p>

<p>This is where Google pays companies like Apple over $20 billion a year for default placement in browsers. This default placement allows them to add almost all users on those platforms as Google search users, feeding the Search Index and the Advertising Index. Another valuable asset for Google here is the User Index, used to personalize ads to each user’s unique needs as determined by the algorithms governing the User Index. Google does not sell user data but monetizes it across all their platforms through ads. Independent sources say that Google has unique data on over 3 billion users worldwide.</p>

<h4>The Advertiser Index</h4>

<p>Google generates around $150 billion in search ad revenue (2022). This ad engine has its own team that drives innovation cycles. The Advertiser Index is the largest in the world for online advertising, covering over 90% of the advertisers globally. It is the repository of advertisers, their ads, and their payment plans, driven by complex reverse auction algorithms to place the right ad above the fold, below the fold, and to the right on a search results page. Users get to search for free because they are paying with their usage data for the ads they see and maybe click on.</p>

<p>With the massive volume of queries and ads served, even if users rarely click on an ad, the sheer volume is enough to generate the highly profitable revenue of USD $150 billion. The CTR (0.86%), CPC ($0.66), and CVR (1.91%) are the estimated stats for Google Ads. These seem small but are gigantic based on the number of users (over 90% of users come to Google), the number of queries (around 1.2 trillion a year), the number of advertisers (over 90% of the online market), and what advertisers are willing to pay for being on the Google platform.</p>

<p>It is estimated that Google generates over $50 per year per user in advertising revenue. Simple math: $150 billion revenue / 3 billion users = $50. Users in the US could easily generate 6 to 10 times the worldwide average, making this a very valuable cohort for Google.</p>

<h3>Google’s self-feeding engine in action</h3>

<p>As seen here, Google has built a self-feeding engine where users, advertisers, and webmasters (owners of websites) all willingly give their data, access, and money. This engine generates its own leadership/monopoly momentum where users of the platforms (users, advertisers, and webmasters) are willing partners in this scheme. Users get their search results free, but they must bear the burden of ads and misalgined incentives.</p>

<p>Advertisers get access to the world’s biggest online platform with the largest number of users, whom they can precisely target if they are willing to pay the highest prices for that benefit. Webmasters are eager as their websites are indexed on the world’s largest search index, giving users a chance to visit their websites, which they can monetize.</p>

<p>Google’s search economics and strategy is built on a flywheel very similar to the famous Amazon virtuous cycle:</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-08-29/1724948706-366037-upload-3d0d1a500877eaf1bf8e5167c6b3dfe2.png" alt="Google self feeding engine"></p>

<p>The point here is that competitors can build competing cycles, but challenging a flywheel once it has gathered full momentum is very difficult. In Amazon’s case, they can be challenged by factors like price (which is non-zero), better choice, and user experience. However, with Google, the challenge is significantly harder because the nominal price is “zero,” while users pay in other currencies - personal data, attention, and changes in behavior. As a society, we are only beginning to recognize the importance of these currencies and the impact they have on our lives.</p>

<p>Now that we understand the architecture, the business strategy, and what goes into Google Search we can examine some key questions.</p>

<h4>Is Google a monopoly?</h4>

<p>This has already been decided by the judge and the answer is <strong>Yes.</strong></p>

<p>Here is a simple table outlining a few key statistics:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Category</th>
<th>Google</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>User query share</td>
<td><strong>&gt;90%</strong></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Advertisers on platform</td>
<td><strong>&gt;90%</strong></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Search Index coverage</td>
<td><strong>&gt;99%</strong></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>User Index coverage</td>
<td><strong>Over 3 billion</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The data shows that the powerful “Virtuous Cycle” flywheel loop driving the “free” search marketplace is overwhelmingly tilted toward Google. Google is a monopoly by market definition, having over 90% of the queries on their platform.</p>

<p>They have built this position over many years by pushing hard on multiple factors: early entry advantage to build the flywheel, consistent spending on innovation in all three areas, and doing everything to keep the advantage going. Even with Bing spending 5-10 billion USD a year, for the past two decades, it is not able to overcome the self-feeding juggernaut that Google is. Unless one is willing to break this self-feeding circle, there is no remediation or outside challenge that can overcome the Google monopoly.</p>

<h4>Is Google preventing competitors from gaining a foothold and are competitors being harmed through default placement deals?</h4>

<p>The answer is <strong>Yes and No</strong>.</p>

<p>It can be argued that default placements significantly contribute to maintaining Google’s market share, with Google reportedly paying companies like Apple over $20 billion for this privilege. Apple has stated that Bing does not match Google’s search result quality, and they are unwilling to compromise on user experience by offering subpar results.</p>

<p>A fair observer must acknowledge that being the default search engine within the Apple ecosystem holds substantial economic value - a value determined by fair market forces, with Google agreeing to pay that price. This may come as a surprise, but from our standpoint as a search market participant, this arrangement between Google and Apple is acceptable. (and interestingly what is more problematic is that Apple users cannot choose Kagi as their search engine at all, which consumers <a href="https://x.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1820563311328424187">see as a hinderance</a> - that said, this issue is beyond the scope of this article).</p>

<p>Even if the government mandates that Google cannot pay for this privilege, two things could happen:</p>

<ol>
<li>Apple loses $20 billion (Google’s windfall) but keeps Google to maintain consistency in the deeply entrenched user experience.</li>
<li>Even if users are forced to contend with another choice, the user selection flow can be manipulated to favor Google, maintaining its dominant market share.</li>
</ol>

<p>The result could still be the same - maybe Google’s market share goes down to 80% - is that still a monopoly?</p>

<h4>Are users being harmed?</h4>

<p>The answer is&nbsp;<strong>Yes</strong>.</p>

<p>This is harder to prove and more nuanced. The service is free to users, the search results are of the best quality among its advertising-driven peers and the results are presented in the blink of an eye. All of these might seem to be an advantage for users and Google.</p>

<p>Usually a relationship between a user and service provider is direct and the objectives of each are in alignment. In this case there are three parties involved – Google, the Advertiser and the user.  Because of the three parties being involved, the objectives are misaligned. This misalignment arises because of the business model being used where Google and the Advertiser are aligned on pushing more ads to the users to generate more revenue while users would prefer to see fewer ads (or no ads) and information in their best interest. For example someone looking for ‘best headphones’ in an ad-based search engine will not get the actual best headphones, but sponsored results from companies which paid the most for the keyword ‘best headphones’. This is a profound mismatch in expectations.</p>

<p>There are four areas where users are being harmed (we acknowledge this is subjective and hard to prove empirically):</p>

<ol>
<li>Limited search results: Users do not get to see any other search results that will use a different set criterion for ranking and presentation and user choice. The user does not know if these are the best results for their query as in 99% of the cases the Google result as presented with ads and ads-based ranking is the only one they see.</li>
<li>Ad saturation: Users are bombarded with ads. There are no significant number of search providers using a different business model, like subscription-based services, that present results without ad influence. Users see many ads and must navigate ad structures just to get to the results, which is very annoying and often intelligence-insulting.</li>
<li>Privacy concerns: The ad-based model relies on user data, placing privacy in Google’s hands. Google “owns” the data (though they say users can manage their data on the platform, but people rarely do). These hyper-targeted ad structures can be easily manipulated algorithmically (hidden, untouched, and uncontrolled by the user), leading to unintended consequences in search result presentation. This can result in claims of user manipulation and bias enforcement.</li>
<li>Misaligned incentives: The main problem with ad-based business model in search and the cause of factors above is the misalignment of incentives. The user and customer are different (customers are advertisers) and every business will try to do what is best for the customer. This will cause the user to be often presented with information and search experience that is not optimized for their needs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Users might not care about the harm of being in the palms of advertisers and 3rd party interest (instead of their own) if the service is free. However, getting unbiased, correct information without influence from advertisers or other algorithms looking to manipulate users is undeniably critical for making the right decisions on information, purchases, politics, and scientific information.</p>

<p>If consumers are being harmed and no other competitive solutions are on the horizon to correct this, we must start looking at remedies that are lasting, easily enforceable, and easily cross-checked for compliance. If we do not apply these principles, the solution will fail or be more harmful to the users.</p>

<h3>What are the right remedies?</h3>

<p>The court has made its ruling, and discussions about remedies have ensued.</p>

<p>We will not delve into other remedies that have been already suggested (such as restricting default search agreements, providing access to clickstream and query data, or splitting AdWords, Android, YouTube, and Chrome from Google) because we believe they address the wrong outcome (how to hurt Google) and fail to pave the way for true innovation and better outcomes for consumers. Readers are encouraged to explore the “References and further reading” section at the end of this article for more information on these approaches.</p>

<p>Instead, we should first step back and consider what is the fundamental problem that we are trying to solve?</p>

<p>The primary purpose of the Sherman Act is not to shield competitors from the success of legitimate businesses or to prevent those businesses from earning fair profits from consumers. Rather, it is to <strong>preserve a competitive marketplace that protects consumers from abuses</strong> (see also <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=y3IOROCcVacC">Competition law and consumer protection</a>, Kluwer Law International, pp. 291–293).</p>

<p>We’ve established that Google’s monopoly is rooted in its significant market share, which is sustained by critical assets under its unique control - the search index, the user index, and the advertiser index. Access to these essential assets is not available to any competitors.</p>

<p>The ad-based search experience, while highly successful, subtly exploits users in ways that are not immediately obvious, though  evidence is steadily building.</p>

<p>We’ve heard from Kagi users that they cannot imagine going back to an ad-based search experience. They came to appreciate this straightforward incentive structure: if the search experience is not good, and they are not finding information they need, they can simply stop paying for the service,  incentivizing the search provider to do better (see <a href="https://havn.blog/2024/05/31/my-search-engine.html">My Search Engine Is Perhaps My Favourite Tech Service</a> and <a href="https://dannb.org/blog/2023/how-kagi-beats-google/">How Kagi finally let me lay Google Search to rest</a>).</p>

<p>There is emerging academic research, such as the study <a href="https://downloads.webis.de/publications/papers/bevendorff_2024a.pdf">Is Google Getting Worse? A Longitudinal Investigation of SEO Spam in Search Engines</a>, that suggests a steady decline in search result quality across major ad-based search engines.</p>

<p>Google founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, predicted this would happen as far back as 1998, <a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf">stating</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users.” … “We expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Google employees are saying this now themselves <a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2024/how-i-use-ai.html#:~:text=But%20have%20you%20seen%20the%20internet%20recently?%20The%20top%205%20results%20are%20usually%20just%20some%20garbage%20content%20farm%20that%20has%20buggy%20code%20from%202008%20that%27s%20been%20updated%20only%20for%20SEO%20and%20still%20doesn%27t%20work.">publicly</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But have you seen the internet recently? The top 5 results are usually just some garbage content farm that has buggy code from 2008 that’s been updated only for SEO and still doesn’t work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s important to note that this decline does not indicate a deterioration in the quality of the Search Index itself. Rather, it reflects the choices made by search providers - in this case, Google Search - regarding what to show from that index to the consumer. Unfortunately, these choices seem to be increasingly aligned with the interests of advertisers rather than those of the consumer.</p>

<p>This has <a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/https-pluralistic-net-2024-04-04-teach-me-how-to-shruggie-kagi-caaa88c221f2">profound implications</a> for the search landscape, as it suggests that other entities (government and privately own) could make different choices with the same Search Index - and create search experiences that better align with consumer interests.</p>

<p>And maybe most importantly, if we step back and ask ourselves what kind of society we want to live in, hardly anyone would say we want to consume critical information from sources that do not have our best interest in mind. Yet that is exactly how our current situation can be described.</p>

<p>Political scientist Ian Bremmer’s astute <a href="https://x.com/ianbremmer/status/966677755424313344?lang=en">observation</a> becomes particularly relevant in this context:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The idea that we get our information as citizens through algorithms determined by the world’s largest advertising company is my definition of dystopia.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This underscores the need to reassess our approach to search and information access in the digital age.</p>

<p>We think that any effective remedy should not attack Google’s business model or its remarkable ingenuity and execution. Instead, it should focus on access to core technologies within its flywheel that will foster more diverse competition. This approach would encourage the development of new solutions and business models in search, ultimately benefiting the consumer.</p>

<p>Of course, any remedy should pass the tests of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it long-lasting?</li>
<li>Is it easily enforceable?</li>
<li>Can it be easily verified?</li>
</ol>

<p>There are three core technology aspects here: the Search Index, the User Index, and the Advertiser Index.</p>

<p>The User Index and the Advertiser Index are tied to the business model, and any remedy here will impact only the business (including payments for placements, etc.), with no actual benefit to the consumer. That leaves the Search Index.</p>

<p>The Search Index is the core engine that drives the search flow and generates results pertinent to the user. If we want different search products (the search page) to flourish and different business models for search products to flourish, we should consider separating the Search Index from the other two indexes and make the Search Index available to competitors. This will drive enormous innovation and free competitors to pursue different business models. The innovation on presenting results to users can center around different ranking criteria, different business models, and different user controls on the data they see.</p>

<p>Since search is a critical but essential resource for all users, the solution we propose is to mandate fair access to the Search Index or to take it a step further, consider treating the Search Index as an “Essential Facility”.</p>

<h4>The “Essential Facilities” Doctrine</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://www.concurrences.com/en/dictionary/essential-facility">Essential Facilities Doctrine</a> is an antitrust principle that requires the owner of an “essential” or “bottleneck” facility to provide competitors with access on reasonable terms. This doctrine has been applied across various industries, from railroads to news services and electrical utilities.</p>

<p>The doctrine traces its origins to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_facilities_doctrine">1912 Supreme Court case United States v. Terminal Railroad Association</a>, which addressed railroads controlling access to key bridges and facilities in St. Louis. This ruling laid the foundation for regulated access to the expansive railroad network in the U.S., even though it was primarily built by private companies.</p>

<p>Over the years, the doctrine has been applied in cases involving news services (Associated Press v. United States, 1945), electrical utilities (Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 1973), and more recently, cable distribution networks (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3802559">Viamedia, Inc. v. Comcast Corp., 2021</a>).</p>

<p>This doctrine ensures that critical infrastructure, such as railroads and power lines, built by private enterprises, serves the public good. It’s a principle that could also be applied to a unique bottleneck resource in the digital age - the Google Search Index.</p>

<h4>Benefits of this approach</h4>

<p>The Google Search Index is a unique and irreplaceable resource within the digital ecosystem. Mandating fair access to it or treating it as an essential facility could address the core issues identified in the US vs. Google case, aligning with the Sherman Act’s objective to promote innovation and genuine competition that benefits consumers.</p>

<p>The insurmountable challenge for any new search company to provide a novel search experience lies in the inability to build a Search Index that competes with Google, due to the enormous investment costs, technological barriers, and time required. It’s akin to expecting a new transportation company to build its own version of the entire railroad infrastructure before even putting a train on the tracks.</p>

<p>Key components of this approach include separating the index from the search product, allowing other companies to develop innovative search solutions using the same high-quality web index. Additionally, providing standardized, fair, and non-discriminatory programmatic access through well-defined application programming interfaces (APIs) is crucial, as Google’s Search Index currently remains the only major search index not easily accessible under commercially friendly terms.</p>

<p>Implementing a tiered pricing model would facilitate various levels of access, accommodating startups and established companies alike, enabling them to pay for access to the Search Index similarly to any other company. Establishing regulatory oversight through a dedicated body would ensure fair access and compliance. These measures would foster a more competitive and innovative search ecosystem never, benefiting consumers and the broader market.</p>

<p>This would bring about several significant benefits:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Increased competition</strong>: Lowering barriers to entry would encourage the development of new, specialized search engines and applications.</li>
<li><strong>Alternative business models</strong>: This approach would enable the creation of paid, private, and free public search options, offering consumers more choice and aligning with their varied needs and preferences.</li>
<li><strong>Improved privacy options</strong>: By facilitating search products that don’t rely on data collection for advertising, users would have greater control over their privacy.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced search quality</strong>: Increased competition could lead to improvements in algorithms and overall user experience, benefiting consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Preservation of search as a public good</strong>: Ensuring broad access to high-quality search capabilities would help maintain search as a vital resource for everyone.</li>
<li><strong>Economic growth</strong>: Opening up the search index could drive the creation of new businesses and services built on search capabilities, contributing to overall economic growth.</li>
<li><strong>Enabling a public search engine</strong>: Last but not least, when considering how we access information as citizens in a modern society, it is crucial to recognize information access as a fundamental human right. The traditional role that public libraries played for centuries in informing citizens is no longer sufficient in the digital age. A public search engine could ensure non-discriminatory access to information, funded by taxpayer money, serving the best interests of all citizens. Imagine it as your local public library on steroids.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Addressing potential challenges</h4>

<p>Our proposal raises important questions and potential challenges, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Impact on innovation incentives</li>
<li>Technical feasibility</li>
<li>International coordination</li>
<li>Fair compensation</li>
<li>Unintended consequences</li>
</ul>

<p>While significant, these challenges are not insurmountable. Open dialogue and expertise from various sectors can lead to workable solutions.</p>

<h3>A Path Forward</h3>

<p>Judge Mehta’s ruling has opened a window for meaningful reform in the search market. By opening access to the dominant search index or treating it as an <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/publications/essential-platforms/">essential facility</a>, we have the opportunity to foster a more open and competitive search ecosystem that better serves users’ needs.</p>

<p>As we move forward, it’s crucial to remember that the future of search will impact how we access information, make decisions, and understand the world. This future should be shaped through collaborative efforts considering all stakeholders’ needs, especially end-users.</p>

<p>To realize the benefits of this proposal, we must also address the broader ecosystem, including promoting more choices in web browsers and empowering users to select search engines that best meet their needs and values.</p>

<p>Policymakers, industry leaders, and the public should join this crucial conversation. Together, we can work towards a future where search technology is harnessed for the greatest public good, fostering innovation, respecting privacy, and ensuring equitable access to the world’s information - all while prioritizing the needs and rights of consumers.</p>

We're building a VS Code extension that generates interactive diagrams of codebases, from system architecture down to function call graphs. Here’s a demo where we analyze OpenHands, uv, and webviz: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgfDXUtWzRk" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgfDXUtWzRk</a>.</p><p>The extension is public if you want to try it on your own repos: <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeViz.codeviz" rel="nofollow">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeViz....</a></p><p>Will and I started CodeViz because we wanted more intuitive representations of software. During our time at Tesla, we encountered a common problem: software engineers spend very little time actually typing code. Most development time was spent navigating convoluted files and building a mental map for each task. At the same time, whiteboard sessions were proof that code could be expressed intuitively.</p><p>We started with autogenerated technical documentation. Of course, long markdown docs are not a good solution for long files of code. We realized we needed diagrams that (a) help grasp large quantities of code and (b) can be filtered according to the developer’s task. So, we built a graph-based VS Code extension. It  generates diagrams directly within VS Code, illustrating connections between functions and providing overviews of system architecture. These visualizations update as code changes.</p><p>CodeViz appears as a side panel in VS Code with two views:</p><p>(1) Call graph: as you click on functions, we show a chain of upstream and downstream references. You can navigate your codebase using the call stack and see, in one view, everywhere your functions are called. We generate this call graph using the language servers developers have already installed in VS Code</p><p>(2) Architecture diagram: we create a C4 diagram of your system, so you can see a top-level view of your codebase and click into the component layer. We were surprised to find that a small fraction of code can generate a very accurate representation of the system. We detect these important files, then use LLMs to build nested architecture diagrams at the container and component level</p><p>Developers are mainly using our extension to navigate spaghetti code, onboard new devs, and interpret open source repos. We're still figuring out our pricing. Currently, we offer basic features for free, with a paid tier for more resource-intensive tools like detailed architecture diagrams. Open to suggestions on this approach.</p><p>CodeViz is in active development and our main focus over the next couple of days is to make the call graph much easier to view and navigate. We're continuously working to make it better, so your honest feedback, suggestions, and wishes would be very helpful. Looking forward to hearing any and all thoughts, whether about the current extension, general problem space, or something else!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                          <p>Thousands of Tennesseans were illegally denied Medicaid and other benefits due to programming and data errors in an algorithmic system the state uses to determine eligibility for low-income residents and people with disabilities, a U.S. District Court judge ruled this week.</p>

 <p>The TennCare Connect system—built by Deloitte and other contractors for more than <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2019/03/18/tenncare-connect-goes-online-400-m-and-5-years-after-obamacare/3108268002/">$400 million</a>—is supposed to analyze income and health information to automatically determine eligibility for benefits program applicants. But in practice, the system often doesn’t load the appropriate data, assigns beneficiaries to the wrong households, and makes incorrect eligibility determinations, according to the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.tnmd.82334/gov.uscourts.tnmd.82334.412.0.pdf">decision</a> from Middle District of Tennessee Judge Waverly Crenshaw Jr.</p> <p>“When an enrollee is entitled to state-administered Medicaid, it should not require luck, perseverance, and zealous lawyering for him or her to receive that healthcare coverage,” Crenshaw wrote in his opinion.</p>

 <p>The decision was a result of a class action lawsuit filed in 2020 on behalf of 35 adults and children who were denied benefits.</p> <p>“This is a tremendous win for the plaintiffs and all TennCare members who have lost their vital health coverage due to TennCare’s unlawful policies and practices,” said Michele Johnson, executive director of the Tennessee Justice Center, which was one of several organizations that represented the plaintiffs. “We are proud to have stood with the courageous families that brought the case in order to protect the health coverage of many thousands of their neighbors across the state.”</p>

 <p>The TennCare Connect system, which launched in 2019, was the result of a years-long effort by the state to modernize its Medicaid system and adhere to new eligibility criteria and streamlined enrollment requirements mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Under the <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/report/getting-into-gear-for-2014-shifting-new-medicaid-eligibility-and-enrollment-policies-into-drive/">new rules</a>, states were supposed to provide a single application process that would collect residents’ information and determine which of the many complex health and disability benefits programs they were eligible for. Crenshaw found that TennCare Connect did not consider whether applicants were eligible for all available programs before it terminated their coverage.</p> <p>Deloitte was a major beneficiary of the nationwide modernization effort, winning contracts to build automated eligibility systems in more than 20 states, including Tennessee and Texas. Advocacy groups have <a href="https://healthlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/NHeLP-EPIC-Upturn-FTC-Deloitte-Complaint.pdf">asked</a> the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Deloitte’s practices in Texas, where they say thousands of residents are similarly being inappropriately denied life-saving benefits by the company’s faulty systems.</p>                          </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Raspberry Pi <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/2gb-raspberry-pi-5-on-sale-now-at-50/">launched the 2 gig Pi 5 for $50</a>, and besides half the RAM and a lower price, it has a new stepping of the main BCM2712 chip.</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-5-C1-vs-D0-Stepping.jpg" alt="BCM2712 C1 vs D0 Stepping chips"></p>

<p>This is the BCM2712 <em>D0</em> stepping. Older Pi 5's shipped with a <em>C1</em>. In <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/2gb-raspberry-pi-5-on-sale-now-at-50/">their blog post</a>, they said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new D0 stepping strips away all that unneeded functionality, leaving only the bits we need.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Steppings are basically chip revisions where they don't change functionality, and usually just fix bugs, or tweak the layout. But even tiny design changes could have unintended consequences. I wanted to see exactly what happens when I push one of these new chips to the limits.</p>

<p>First, I wanted a performance baseline, so I ran Geekbench with the latest Pi OS and all the defaults.</p>

<p>Except... apparently Geekbench likes more than 2 gigs of RAM. I couldn't get past the multicore Photo Filter test, since the OS kept running outta memory. A lotta software nowadays is built for an <em>absolute minimum</em> of 4 or 8 gigs. So keep that in mind when you're buying a Pi.</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi5-geekbench6-oom.jpeg" alt="Geekbench 6 kernel Linux OOM killer"></p>

<p>Without adding swap, Geekbench was out, but I still wanted to get some raw numbers, so I ran <code>sysbench</code>. It's lighter weight, it runs with limited memory, and it still gives me CPU numbers to compare.</p>

<p>Using a combination of <a href="https://amzn.to/4e2SRIv">this 10W peltier cooler</a> and the bottom heatsink from an <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/edatec/ED-PI5CASE-OB/21769666">EDAtec fanless case</a>, I ran through a number of overclock scenarios:</p>

<table>
<thead>

</tbody>
</table>

<blockquote>
  <p>I ran the command <code>sysbench --test=cpu --cpu-max-prime=20000 --num-threads=4 run</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At 3.6 GHz the Pi wouldn't boot—there were always memory errors and it would completely freeze. At 3.5 GHz, there were still some stability issues, and I couldn't get the Pi to reboot cleanly.</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-5-heatsink-peltier.jpeg" alt="Pi 5 heatsink - Peltier cooling"></p>

<p>For any speeds above 3.1 GHz, I also used my <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/pi-overvolt">pi-overvolt</a> hack, which I cover more in depth in my blog post <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/hacking-pi-firmware-get-fastest-overclock">Hacking Pi firmware to get the fastest overclock</a>.</p>

<p>There's still a hard limit of 1.1V from the PMIC, so besides splicing in higher voltages direct into the SoC, the only other hardware-level modification I hadn't tried was delidding the Pi's processor.</p>

<p><em>Theoretically</em>, this would allow the Peltier cooler to pull heat off the silicon even faster.</p>

<h2>Delidding</h2>

<p>But there was another reason I wanted to delid a 2 gig Pi 5. Raspberry Pi mentioned in their blog post the D0 stepping was simpler and cheaper to make, since they removed 'dark silicon'. That just means there were portions of the BCM2712 that Broadcom put in but Raspberry Pi never used, <a href="https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?p=2247912#p2247832">like the built-in Ethernet controller</a>. Raspberry Pi built their own Ethernet into the RP1, so they didn't use the controller in the main SoC.</p>

<p>What this means for the D0 is the actual CPU die is smaller. A smaller die fits more chips on a single wafer, meaning individual chips cost less, assuming chip production yields are the same.</p>

<p>I already have a delidded C1 chip from back <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/die-shots-and-transistor-level-debugging-on-raspberry-pi-5">when I worked with John McMaster and Kleindiek on my Pi 5 silicon deep-dive</a>, so I just need to delid the D0 chip.</p>

<p>I placed the 2 GB Pi 5 on my workbench, and worked at the corners with a razor blade:</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-5-heatspreader-delidding-razor-blade.jpeg" alt="Pi 5 delid heat spreader with razor knife blade"></p>

<p>The heat spreader popped off, and I took some measurements, comparing the C1 to the D0 stepping:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Stepping</th>
  <th>Width</th>
  <th>Height</th>
  <th>Die area</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>BCM2712 D0</td>
  <td>6.30mm</td>
  <td>5.98mm</td>
  <td>37.674mm<sup>2</sup></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>BCM2712 C1</td>
  <td>6.47mm</td>
  <td>8.63mm</td>
  <td>55.836mm<sup>2</sup></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The D0 is 32.5% smaller than the older version, which would definitely bring down the price per chip, assuming the same yield on a given silicon wafer. It seems they're still using the 16nm process node, so that's a good chunk of 'dark silicon' removed!</p>

<h2>Direct Die Cooling</h2>

<p>I powered up the Pi, with the new direct-die cooling arrangement, but still had stability issues at 3.6 GHz. Maybe even a little more at 3.5, it was hard to tell.</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/bcm2712-bare-die-cooling.jpeg" alt="BCM2712 bare die running with no cooling"></p>

<p>Just for fun, I pulled off the cooler entirely, and let the Pi run with just the die exposed to the air. It was happy running like this, even running sysbench at 2.8 GHz for 10 seconds without throttling.</p>

<p>So could you run a Pi completely naked? Sure, but the heat spreader does a good job getting more heat off the whole package, so I'd just leave it on.</p>

<p>My takeaway is the Pi's 16 nanometer chip seems to max out around 3.5 Gigahertz.</p>

<h2>Thermals and Efficiency - The Goldilocks Pi</h2>

<p>The other big question though, is whether the smaller design is any better for efficiency or thermals.</p>

<p>CNX Software did some testing and <a href="https://www.cnx-software.com/2024/08/27/comparison-of-raspberry-pi-5-with-2gb-and-8gb-ram-hardware-benchmarks-and-power-consumption/">published a chart</a>, showing a significant difference, 2.7W to 3.5W, for idle power consumption.</p>

<p>I haven't done <em>exhaustive</em> testing, but I did run through my <a href="https://gist.github.com/geerlingguy/91d4736afe9321cbfc1062165188dda4">stress benchmarks</a>, monitoring power and heat. I ran it on all the Pi 5 models, with identical test parameters. I have more <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/pi-overvolt/issues/4">in this GitHub issue</a>, but this chart sums it up:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th></th>
  <th>Pi 5 2GB D0</th>
  <th>Pi 5 4GB C1</th>
  <th>4GB Delta</th>
  <th>Pi 5 8GB C1</th>
  <th>8GB Delta</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Idle power</td>
  <td>2.4W</td>
  <td>3.3W</td>
  <td><strong>0.9W (+32%)</strong></td>
  <td>3.2W</td>
  <td><strong>0.8W (+29%)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Idle temp</td>
  <td>30°C</td>
  <td>32°C</td>
  <td><strong>2°C (+6%)</strong></td>
  <td>32°C</td>
  <td><strong>2°C (+6%)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>stress-ng power</td>
  <td>8.9W</td>
  <td>9.8W</td>
  <td><strong>0.9W (+10%)</strong></td>
  <td>9.8W</td>
  <td><strong>0.9W (+10%)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>stress-ng temp</td>
  <td>59°C</td>
  <td>63°C</td>
  <td><strong>4°C (+7%)</strong></td>
  <td>64°C</td>
  <td><strong>5°C (+8%)</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>For idle power draw, the improvement almost mirrors the chip size reduction. The chip is 33% smaller, and the idle power draw is almost that much better.</p>

<p>And here are the thermals for my test runs, for completeness:</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-5-c1-vs-d0-thermals.jpg" alt="Pi 5 C1 vs D0 stepping - thermals"></p>

<p>Some of the power savings could be chalked up to less RAM, because more RAM requires more power. But that doesn't explain all the results. Thomas Kaiser <a href="https://www.cnx-software.com/2024/08/27/comparison-of-raspberry-pi-5-with-2gb-and-8gb-ram-hardware-benchmarks-and-power-consumption/#comment-620747">also found the OPP tables are different with the new chip</a>. The 2 gig model doesn't need as much voltage to hit certain clocks, like it uses 805 mV at 2.1 GHz versus 850 mV for the 8 gig model.</p>

<p>As a final efficiency test, I ran my <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/top500-benchmark/issues/40">top500 HPL benchmark on the 2 gig Pi 5</a>. HPL is a memory-intense benchmark, and because the 2 GB model only has 2 GB of RAM, the overall efficiency for this test was worse, coming in at <strong>2.07 Gflops/W</strong>. The 8 GB Pi 5 gets <strong>2.75 Gflops/W</strong>.</p>

<p>For now, the biggest difference between the 2, 4, and 8 GB PI 5s for <em>most</em> people would still be having more RAM. If you know you can run your apps in 2 GB, this is a great little Pi for that. If you can't, then I think Raspberry Pi set up the 4 GB Pi 5 as the 'goldilocks': Not too expensive, with just enough RAM for most uses.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So is it worth stepping down to a 2 GB Pi 5 just to get the simpler D0 chip? No. But is it cool to have a cheaper 2 gig option exist? Yes. Just make sure you have a use case for it that doesn't need a ton of RAM.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="block-tsa"><span id="cb2544b620ab4adb82692781483173f2"></span><h2 id="block-cb2544b620ab4adb82692781483173f2">Introduction</h2><p id="block-5110571d9c504c6c81cc9b24098d2f01">Like many, <a href="https://twitter.com/samwcyo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam Curry</a> and I spend a lot of time waiting in airport security lines. If you do this enough, you might sometimes see a special lane at airport security called <strong>Known Crewmember</strong> (KCM). KCM is a TSA program that allows pilots and flight attendants to bypass security screening, even when flying on domestic personal trips.</p><p id="block-15290d09e5c14891aa7e5a90578f1e42">The KCM process is fairly simple: the employee uses the dedicated lane and presents their KCM barcode or provides the TSA agent their employee number and airline. <a href="https://www.apfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/KCM-Program-Changes_OCT19.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Various forms of ID</a> need to be presented while the TSA agent’s laptop verifies the employment status with the airline. If successful, the employee can access the sterile area without any screening at all. </p><p id="block-5fb348f7f51f4b228e79509e86ed0bcd">A similar system also exists for cockpit access, called the <strong>Cockpit Access Security System</strong> (CASS). Most aircraft have at least one jumpseat inside the cockpit sitting behind the flying pilots. When pilots need to commute or travel, it is not always possible for them to occupy a revenue seat, so a jumpseat can be used instead. CASS allows the gate agent of a flight to verify that the jumpseater is an authorized pilot. The gate agent can then inform the crew of the flight that the jumpseater was authenticated by CASS.</p><p id="block-b09c8233b01f4d6992aa6c223c6c4126">The employment status check is the most critical component of these processes. If the individual doesn’t currently work for an airline, they have not had a background check and should not be permitted to bypass security screening or access the cockpit. This process is also responsible for returning the photo of the crewmember to ensure the right person is being authorized for access. So how does this work, when every airline presumably uses a different system to store their employee information? That is what we were wondering, and where it gets interesting…</p><span id="0f91f0757e014a77ba9b3e3fde656baf"></span><h2 id="block-0f91f0757e014a77ba9b3e3fde656baf">ARINC </h2><p id="block-5c8319d635fd442da648f5e6ad7d14e7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARINC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARINC</a> (a subsidiary of Collins Aerospace) appears to be contracted by the TSA to operate the Known Crewmember system. ARINC operates a few central components, including an online website for pilots and flight attendants to check their KCM status, and an API to route authorization requests between different airlines. Each airline appears to operate their own authorization system to participate in KCM and CASS, and it interacts with the “hub” of ARINC.</p><p id="block-aad1266bbba04920bafe0731766f8582">The TSA and airlines can send requests such as <code>CockpitAccessRequest</code> and <code>CrewVerificationRequest</code> to ARINC, which then routes it to the appropriate airline’s system and receives the response. There are <a href="https://www.knowncrewmember.org/airlines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">77 airlines</a> currently participating in KCM. While larger airlines have likely built their own system, how do smaller airlines respond to these requests to participate in KCM or CASS?</p><span id="99a6c236791b49c1b92441fbfa50ffcb"></span><h2 id="block-99a6c236791b49c1b92441fbfa50ffcb">FlyCASS.com</h2><p id="block-6a2f9ee861344bb8837f1d231dba24c6">In our search for vendors that actually run the authorization systems, we found a site called <a href="https://www.flycass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FlyCASS</a> which pitches small airlines a web-based interface to CASS. Intrigued, we noticed every airline had its own login page, such as Air Transport International (8C) being available at <code>/ati</code>.

We did not want to contact FlyCASS first as it appeared to be operated only by one person and we did not want to alarm them. On April 23rd, we were able to disclose the issue to the Department of Homeland Security, who acknowledged the issue and confirmed that they “are taking this very seriously”. FlyCASS was subsequently disabled in KCM/CASS and later appears to have remediated the issues.</p><p id="block-0c868581924b4680964d6534e7dc6628">After the issue was fixed, we attempted to coordinate the safe disclosure of this issue.

However, a KCM barcode is not required to use KCM checkpoints, as the TSO can enter an airline employee ID manually. After we informed the TSA of this, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221001213220/https://mykcmsupport.com/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they deleted the section of their website that mentions manually entering an employee ID</a>, and did not respond to our correction. We have confirmed that the interface used by TSOs still allows manual input of employee IDs.</p><p id="block-83fbfcaff7214b93b11e6ba4d8378fc8">Several other attacks were also likely possible. Since our vulnerability allowed us to edit an existing KCM member, we could have changed the photo and name of an existing enrolled user, which would likely bypass any vetting process that may exist for new members. If you are able to obtain an unenrolled KCM barcode, you can also enroll it to an employee ID yourself on the KCM website.</p><span id="ca072cb33f5c45a98f2ad3e874cb6ac0"></span><h2 id="block-ca072cb33f5c45a98f2ad3e874cb6ac0">Timeline</h2><ul><li id="block-a8cef222f5014cbe9bbbbb2d4d3b8538">04/23/2024: Initial disclosure to ARINC and FAA</li><li id="block-051304e2f4264d1b97dc755c1709153f">04/24/2024: Subsequent disclosure to DHS via CISA</li><li id="block-9c58a3b8c02a45a78b42da239c8639da">04/25/2024: DHS CISO confirms they are working on a resolution</li><li id="block-fd638dcbe6004c56be550f61d7eb86b4">05/07/2024: DHS CISO confirms FlyCASS was disconnected from KCM/CASS</li><li id="block-e68dff0aa21e4ef89a0e7d901ae978b3">05/17/2024: Follow-up to DHS CISO about TSA statements (no reply)</li><li id="block-2a2ab638ed704d2faab8a4917535a984">06/04/2024: Follow-up to DHS CISO about TSA statements (no reply)</li></ul><span id="2b40219408b04b0297eb78cd9e3d13e0"></span><h2 id="block-2b40219408b04b0297eb78cd9e3d13e0">Collaborators</h2><ul><li id="block-81b57a91ad9e4d70ae3426c4ac84ad89">Ian Carroll (<a href="https://twitter.com/iangcarroll" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/iangcarroll</a>)</li><li id="block-d12eca81b7d0493ebdcbeade4bb3fde8">Sam Curry (<a href="https://twitter.com/samwcyo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/samwcyo</a>) </li></ul></article></div>]]></description>

Many big legal fights in politics have a lead-up, akin to a boxing match, to help us understand the stakes. “In this corner, the challenger, in that corner the world heavyweight champion…” With such a setup, journalists can write with a clear narrative. </p><p><span>For instance, in the </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/governing-in-the-political-twilight" rel="">Moody vs NetChoice opinion</a><span> in earlier this summer, the Supreme Court came out with a strange argument on whether big tech firms get to shield themselves from regulation by saying that their activity is speech, and therefore protected by the First Amendment. This decision got a lot of coverage, because it was a Supreme Court decisions with a lot of briefings and groups paying attention. </span></p><p>But this Third Circuit decision just dropped on a random Tuesday. No one expected three judges to upend the business model of large tech firms, and shake up decades of precedent. But they did just that. </p><p><span>For sure, this news will trickle out, every big tech CEO is or will get a briefing from their panicked general counsel. Every law firm in the country is likely writing a client alert about this opinion. Plaintiff lawyers are sharpening their pens and examining new legal theories to go after tech platforms. Academics are ripping up their lectures on internet law. Big tech-friendly scholars are </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7234611783288676352/" rel="">very upset</a><span>. Supreme Court watchers are or will consider when and how this gets to the highest court. But it’ll take a few days, or maybe weeks, to internalize what just happened. </span></p><p>Speaking of… what did just happen? Well let’s start with the facts of the case, which are pretty horrible.</p><blockquote><p>TikTok, Inc., via its algorithm, recommended and promoted videos posted by third parties to ten-year-old Nylah Anderson on her uniquely curated “For You Page.” One video depicted the “Blackout Challenge,” which encourages viewers to record themselves engaging in acts of self-asphyxiation. After watching the video, Nylah attempted the conduct depicted in the challenge and unintentionally hanged herself. Nylah’s mother, Tawainna Anderson, sued TikTok and its corporate relative ByteDance.</p></blockquote><p>TikTok knew that such videos were causing kids to get into tragic accidents, and yet had its algorithm target children nonetheless. Anderson’s family sued under Pennsylvania state law for product liability, negligence, and wrongful death. The lower district court dismissed the claim, ruling that TikTok isn’t responsible, because TikTok was merely hosting the speech of others, not making the speech itself. </p><p><span>The part of the code governing this conduct is, as I noted above, </span><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230" rel="">Section 230</a><span>, a law passed in 1996 to deal with cases involving whether the hosting service such as Prodigy or CompuServe was liable for defamatory comments posted by users in online message board chat rooms. The law says that if an ‘interactive computer service’ hosts the speech of someone else, it is not liable for that speech, but is only liable for its own speech. It also gave services the right to filter without liability. A platform is not liable for “any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.”</span></p><p>So basically, these nascent platforms, or any future platform, would not be liable for the speech of users in their chatrooms, but would be liable for what its own moderators said. If one of them imposed filters on the chatroom to keep out porn, it would not be considered liable for the resulting speech. </p><p><span>Two things happened to change the scope of the legal impact. First, the internet grew tremendously, encompassing the kinds of activities that did not exist in 1996, such as social media and data-heavy surveillance advertising. Second, judges expanded the reach of Section 230 to everything from online commerce to hotel booking sites, and found that platforms were never liable for what happened, even if the site was facilitating the harm. Following a 1997 Fourth Circuit expansive decision called </span><em>Zeran v. America Online, </em><span>eight different circuit courts have ruled along these</span><em> </em><span>lines</span><em>.</em><span> </span></p><p><span>It’s not that big tech platforms took advantage of this law, though they do take advantage of it today. This law </span><em>created</em><span> the business model of big tech platforms. There is no way to run a targeted ad social media company with 40% margins if you have to make sure children aren’t harmed by your product. This legal reading not only made a world where Mark Zuckerberg didn’t have to care whether he was hurting kids, it made a world where he would lose out to rivals if he did.</span></p><p>As one judge wrote, “Today, § 230 rides in to rescue corporations from virtually any claim loosely related to content posted by a third party, no matter the cause of action and whatever the provider’s actions.” There’s a shape-shifting element here as well. When corporations want to avoid being regulated, they call what they do speech and claim First Amendment rights. But when someone tries to hold them liable for defamation or unlawful speech, they claim they are mere vessels for others, and thus immune under Section 230. This dynamic creates what one court called “a lawless no-man’s-land.” </p><p><span>What are some of the specific harms? Well such bad acts include Grindr knowingly </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/rumors-spread-on-social-media" rel="">facilitating</a><span> sexual violence, credit reporting agencies trying </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/will-an-obscure-internet-law-screw?s=w" rel="">to avoid </a><span>being regulated for mistakes in credit reports, or Facebook fostering </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/rumors-spread-on-social-media" rel="">ethnic violence</a><span>. Identity thieves use social media sites to steal money, with the IRS </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/17/irs-flagged-more-than-1-million-tax-returns-for-identity-fraud-in-2023.html" rel="">flagging</a><span> more than 1 million tax returns for identity fraud in 2023, with information largely captured on LinkedIn or Meta’s sites. Today, “scammers use Facebook to </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/28/technology/facebook-military-scam.html" rel="">impersonate soldiers</a><span> so as to start fake long-distance relationships with lonely people, eventually tricking their victims into sending their ‘boyfriends’ money.” And social media firms use algorithms to target gambling addicts with ‘social casino’ apps. These platforms aren’t liable for any of it, because of the weird and creepy reading of Section 230 combined with a corporatized First Amendment.</span></p><p><span>This dynamic is like pollution, with large platforms financed by targeted ads offloading costs onto the rest of us. I wrote </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/monopolies-take-a-fifth-of-your-wages" rel="">this up</a><span> in 2022, when Clarence Thomas </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21-459_6k47.pdf" rel="">took a swipe</a><span> at the expansive reading of the law:</span></p><blockquote><p>The reason for the use and misuse of Section 230 is simple. Advertising money. In particular, the kind of advertising facilitated by large swaths of personal data depends on Section 230 immunity, otherwise dominant platforms would have to spend large amounts on content moderation, and probably couldn’t avoid liability even if it did so. Thomas doesn’t like this setup, and in his statement, he pointed out that Facebook refused to do anything to stop the use of its services by human traffickers “because doing so would cost the company users—and the advertising revenue those users generate.”</p></blockquote><p><span>That said, starting five years ago or so, courts have begun narrowing Section 230, with such cases as </span><em><a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2021/05/04/20-55295.pdf" rel="">Lemmon vs Snap</a><span>, </span></em><span>which began to treat harmful features on tech platforms under product liability law instead of speech law. Still, all of these decisions are at a circuit court level. The Supreme Court heard several cases in 2023, </span><em>Gonzalez v Google</em><span> and </span><em>Twitter vs Taamneh</em><span>, but has yet to take a real position on the law. </span></p><p><span>The last major case heard by the Supreme Court on the problem of big tech platforms and speech was, as I noted earlier, in </span><em><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/did-google-facebook-and-amazon-endorse" rel="">Moody vs NetChoice.</a><span> </span></em><span>In that case, whose opinion was released earlier this summer, Florida and Texas passed laws saying that large tech platforms couldn’t discriminate based on the speaker’s political views. The Supreme Court ruled, with five votes, that such laws were likely unconstitutional, as the editorial discretion of the platforms to exclude political speech in curated feeds was protected by the First Amendment.</span></p><p>But interestingly, the court made a distinction about which algorithms get First Amendment protection. If a feed responds “solely to how users act online—giving them the content they appear to want, without any regard to independent content standards," it is not speech, and therefore it can be regulated. But if an algorithm includes editorial or content moderated elements, it is speech and cannot.</p><p>In the opinion released today, the Third Circuit drew on the NetChoice decision, and inverted it. NetChoice, a trade association of big tech trade companies, sought, and got, First Amendment protection for curated feeds, which meant certain aspects of how platforms operate were beyond government regulation. But be careful what you wish for, because the Third Circuit ruled that now everything said on those feeds is now the responsibility of the tech platform.</p><blockquote><p>The Court held that a platform’s algorithm that reflects “editorial judgments” about “compiling the third-party speech it wants in the way it wants” is the platform’s own “expressive product” and is therefore protected by the First Amendment.</p><p>Given the Supreme Court’s observations that platforms engage in protected first-party speech under the First Amendment when they curate compilations of others’ content via their expressive algorithms, it follows that doing so amounts to first-party speech under § 230, too.</p></blockquote><p>Because TikTok’s “algorithm curates and recommends a tailored compilation of videos for a user’s FYP based on a variety of factors, including the user’s age and other demographics, online interactions, and other metadata,” it becomes TikTok’s own speech. And now TikTok has to answer for it in court. Basically, the court ruled that when a company is choosing what to show kids and elderly parents, and seeks to keep them addicted to sell more ads, they can’t pretend it’s everyone else’s fault when the inevitable horrible thing happens.</p><p>And that’s a huge rollback of Section 230.</p><p><span>The business model of significant corporate actors today, from Google to Meta to TikTok, relies on them being immune from liability for what their users say even as they serve targeted advertising. That business model, of “keep ‘em swiping,” is now in jeopardy. With the Third Circuit splitting with how most other judges have interpreted Section 230, and using the recent </span><em>NetChoice </em><span>opinion to do so, policymakers will now have no choice but to start working through problems in Section 230. This case will get appealed, and it’ll likely go to the Supreme Court. </span></p><p>So what happens going forward? Well we’re going to have to start thinking about what a world without this expansive reading of Section 230 looks like. To do that, let’s look at one of the more interesting parts of the decision. It doesn’t really make sense to say that TikTok is the “publisher” of the challenge videos, but it’s also not just the neutral host of the videos. And one judge really got that. </p><p><span>Surprisingly, questions of big tech power and speech do not split on partisan lines. On the Supreme Court, for instance, Clarence Thomas and Ketanji Brown Jackson frequently align against Brett Kavanaugh and Elana Kagan, with Amy Coney Barrett as a swing justice. Both Trump and Biden are hostile to Section 230. Republican regulators like </span><a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20220331/114545/HHRG-117-IF16-Wstate-CarrB-20220331.pdf" rel="">Brendan Carr</a><span> and Democratic regulators like </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1510713/chopra_-_aba_spring_meeting_3-28-19_0.pdf" rel="">Rohit Chopra</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1597534/joint_statement_on_henderson_amicus.pdf" rel="">Lina Khan</a><span> have </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1536911/chopra_dissenting_statement_on_facebook_7-24-19.pdf" rel="">for years</a><span> expressed concern over the way the law has been misused.</span></p><p><span>In Tuesday’s Third Circuit case, an Obama appointee - Patty Shwartz - and a Trump appointee - Peter J. Phipps - agreed on the substantive decision, with another Trump appointee - Paul Matey - wanting to go much further to ratchet back Section 230. Big tech power, in other words, is not always partisan, but has a populist/anti-populist split. As if to prove the point, Matey is a Federalist Society conservative, but he cited my book </span><em>Goliath</em><span> in his opinion.</span></p><p>So where did Matey go? Well he agreed with overruling the district court, but broke with libertarianism, bringing back a reliance on common law traditions. He showed how the Congressional reading of common carriage rules in 1996 suggested that internet companies should have the same degree of liability as, say, tobacco companies, pharmaceutical manufacturers, appliance makers, and food service establishments. </p><p><span>Instead of arguing that TikTok was the </span><em>publisher</em><span> of the challenge videos, Matey made the point that TikTok was its </span><em>distributor</em><span>. Drawing on common carriage traditions, he pointed to an older pre-internet legal distinction between “publisher” liability for speech, which is to say that author or publisher’s responsibility, and “distributor” liability for speech, which is to say the bookstore, library, or newsstand’s role. </span></p><p><span>The sale of indecent material has traditionally conferred different liability on the publisher of that material versus the distributor of it. The early Section 230 case law wrote that publisher/distributor distinction out of existence, and Matey says that case law was in error. With its algorithmic boosting, he said, TikTok is best understood as a distributor. That’s consistent with how Chopra and </span><a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/02/26/supreme-court-grapples-with-state-social-media-content-laws/" rel="">several Supreme Court Justices</a><span> see the problem.</span></p><p>In other words, the fundamental issue here is not really whether big tech platforms should be regulated as speakers, as that’s a misconception of what they do. They don’t speak, they are middlemen. And hopefully, we will follow the logic of Matey’s opinion, and start to see the policy problem as what to do about that.</p><p>This case is going to be catalytic. If/when this goes to the Supreme Court, there are going to be a gazillion amicus briefs, and endless stories on how This Is the Case That Could Destroy/Save the Internet. And now plaintiff lawyers will think about the litigation they can bring. Without Section 230 as a shield, at least in the Third Circuit, is Facebook now liable for facilitating military scams? Are the big tech platforms going to have to face claims for helping violate state gambling laws or being a party to mass identity theft or sexual assault or child abuse? What about garden variety defamation claims they have been able to ignore until now? These are billion dollar questions.</p><p>With this in mind, I’d be surprised if most of Silicon Valley isn’t gearing up for a lobbying campaign to get Congress to enact Section 230 “reform,” which is to say, get this out of the court system by passing new laws. Some of the more realistic execs will start thinking about how to modify their business models to accord with a world where they are liable for what they do. As a different contact told me, “Huge nail in 230 coffin, maybe the only nail needed, although likely there will be a circuit split on question of whether/how to understand algorithm as expressive activity with respect to 230 so the Supreme Court will have to finish 230 burial in a few years.”</p><p>Of course, the Supreme Court could try to avoid the issue, or rule badly. Congress could override the courts. But at the very least, this decision forces the issue. And that means the gravy train, where big tech has been able to pollute our society without any responsibility, is likely ending. </p><p><span>Thanks for reading.

<p dir="auto">This library uses DMA driven ring buffers for both transmit and receive. The
transmit side is entirely DMA driven, while the receive side uses a per-packet
interrupt to finalize a received packet. Performance does vary with system
clock speed, and the memory region the executable is placed:</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Resource Utilization</h2><a id="user-content-resource-utilization" aria-label="Permalink: Resource Utilization" href="#resource-utilization"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The library uses:</p>

<li>Five DMA channels: 2 receive, 3 transmit. Two channels are used per Tx/Rx for
ring buffer management, and the third Tx channel assists in generating the
Ethernet Inter Packet Gap.</li>
<li>Two interrupts: 1 shared for MDIO, and 1 exclusive for the end-of-packet
processing.</li>
<li>Two 4KB aligned memory regions for Tx/Rx data, 32/64 long word pointer

<li>One PWM timer used as MD clock</li>
<li>One DMA timer used to assist with IPG generation</li>
<li>12 PIO instructions for Tx, 6 for Rx, total 18</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">At 300 MHz, almost all of core 1 is used. It is possible to use about 6
usec per packet poll, verified by placing a sleep_us(6) call in
netif_rmii_ethernet_loop() and running iperf. Core 0, of course, remains

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p><em>This post presents <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07495" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research on the privacy harms and risks</a> of Google’s recent <a href="https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/cookies/related-website-sets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Related Website Sets</a> feature, to be presented at the <a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 Internet Measurement Conference</a>. The research finds both that the Related Website Sets feature would reverse some of the privacy benefits of deprecating third-party cookies, and that Google’s justification for reintroducing this privacy harm (i.e., that Web users can tell when two different sites are run by the same organization) is untrue for many, potentially most, Web users. The study supports other browsers’ decision to reject the feature because of its privacy risks, and highlights the risk Related Website Sets poses to Chrome users.</em></p>
<p><em>The study was conducted by researchers at University of St Andrews, Imperial College London, Hong Kong University of Science &amp; Technology (GZ), and Brave Software. This post was written by Principal Privacy Researcher Peter Snyder.</em></p>


<p>Related Website Sets (RWS) is a recent Chrome feature, proposed by Google in anticipation of the end of third-party cookies. The privacy and security harms caused by third-party cookies are well documented, and have led every major Web browser to either block third-party cookies, or announce plans to do so (even if Google has, again, pushed its planned deprecation date back).</p>
<p>According to Google, Related Website Sets reenables third-party-cookie-like-behavior where it benefits users, without reintroducing the broader privacy harms of third-party cookies. In reality, <strong>RWS aims to allow (for example) Google to link the videos you watch on YouTube to your Google profile, even when you’re not logged into YouTube, and even after third-party cookies have been deprecated in Chrome</strong>. While the research described in this post presents and evaluates Google’s stated motivations with RWS, the core truth is that RWS exists for advertiser-serving situations like the above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The broad idea behind RWS is that if two different sites are run by the same organization (for example, instagram.com and facebook.com are both run by Meta), then there is no need for the browser to block third-party cookies between the two sites, since the user already expects that both sites will share information with each other.</p>
<p>More casually, the motivation behind RWS is something like this: <strong>there’s no point in telling your mom a secret, and then trying to keep that secret from your dad; you should assume your parents are going to share everything with each other.</strong></p>
<p>RWS is a user-hostile weakening of the Web’s privacy model, plainly designed to benefit websites and advertisers, to the detriment of user privacy. Google argues that RWS actually benefits users, either because the privacy exceptions help fix “<a href="https://github.com/WICG/first-party-sets?tab=readme-ov-file#providing-capabilities-beyond-the-storage-access-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener">site compatibility issues</a>” or to keep users “<a href="https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/cookies/related-website-sets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed in</a>” across related domains. But a quick look at the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/related-website-sets/blob/main/related_website_sets.JSON" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actual Related Website Sets exceptions list</a> reveals many examples unrelated to even these (even hypothetically) user-benefiting use cases, and these sites work correctly in browsers that do not implement RWS (i.e., almost all other browsers).</p>
<p>In reality, the primary motivation behind Related Website Sets is as frustrating as it is unsurprising: to benefit advertisers to the detriment of users (or, as Google euphemistically says, to “<a href="https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/cookies/related-website-sets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show you personalized content</a>”). As with so many other user-harmful and needlessly-complex choices in Chrome’s overarching “<a href="https://www.privacysandbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Sandbox</a>” proposal, RWS exists to make sure Chrome continues to serve advertisers’ needs first, even once Google has been shamed into (finally) deprecating third-party cookies.</p>

<h2 id="study-description-users-understandably-do-not-anticipate-site-relations">Study Description: Users (Understandably) Do Not Anticipate Site Relations</h2>
<p>The study considered RWS impact on Web privacy by testing whether the underlying assumption in RWS is correct: can Web users accurately determine if two different sites are related to each other? More specifically, if a Web user is presented with two different websites, how accurately are they able to decide whether the two sites are related to each other, given the existing site-relationships defined by Chrome’s RWS list.</p>
<p>In general, we found that Web users cannot accurately determine if two sites are related to each other (as determined by the Related Sites Set feature). We conducted a user study with 30 Web users, recruited over social media, and presented them each with 20 pairs of websites. Website pairs were randomly selected from both the Related Website Sets list (i.e., sites Google designates as “related”, and so warranting reduced privacy protections), and the Tranco list of popular websites. Each user was presented with different pairs of websites, asked to view the sites, and then decide if they thought the two sites were operated by the same organization. This resulted in 430 determinations of whether unique pairs of websites were related (some of the 30 users did not provide an answer to all of the 20 website pairs they were presented).</p>
<p>We found that users’ expectations for which sites were related often didn’t match the Related Website Sets list, and as a result, the RWS feature re-enables third-party cookie-like behavior in many cases users could not anticipate. In our study, the large majority of users (~73%) made at least one incorrect determination of whether two sites were related to each other, and almost half (~42%) of the determinations made during the study (i.e., all determinations from all users) were incorrect. Most concerning, of the cases where both sites <em>were</em> related (according to the RWS feature), users guessed that the sites were unrelated ~37% of the time, meaning that users would have thought Chrome was protecting them when it was not.</p>
<p>We conclude from this that the premise underlying RWS is fundamentally incorrect; Web users are (understandably, predictably) not able to accurately determine whether two sites are owned by the same organization. And as a result, RWS is reintroducing exactly the kinds of privacy harms that third-party cookies cause.</p>
<p>Lest anyone judge the study participants for being uninformed, or not taking the study seriously, consider for yourself: which of the following pairs of sites are related?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>hindustantimes.com and healthshots.com</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>vwo.com and wingify.com</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>economictimes.com and cricbuzz.com</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>indiatoday.in and timesofindia.com</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind, a user needs to determine whether two domains are related <em>before</em> clicking on a link; once a site has been loaded, any information sharing and tracking has already occurred.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we find that RWS will be harmful to user privacy, and reintroduce the kinds of privacy harms the Web has been moving away from by removing third-party cookies. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07495" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full paper</a> will be presented at the <a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 Internet Measurement Conference</a>.</p>
<p>(For the above quiz, if you chose “4”, then, unfortunately that is incorrect. That is in fact the only pair of the four that <em>isn’t</em> considered “related” to each other.)</p>


<p>However, beyond the findings from the user study, we note a more fundamental privacy harm with RWS. RWS rests on the idea that if two sites are related to each other, then it’s harmless (or, at least “acceptable”) for the browser to reduce privacy protections between those two sites. Or, to go back to the previous analogy, <strong>if mom already knows something, then there’s no harm in telling dad; dad is going to find out regardless</strong><em>.</em></p>
<p>This assumption is wrong; modern Web browsers are perfectly capable of preventing (say) Meta from knowing that your Facebook account and your Instagram account are owned by the same person if you register them with different email addresses and information. In fact, this is the default behavior of most Web browsers today, both browsers focused at a popular audience (e.g., Brave, Firefox, Safari) and browsers targeting specialized audiences (e.g., Tor Browsers, Icefox). Unless you use the same credentials to register an account on two different sites, modern browsers can absolutely prevent two sites operated by the same organization from linking your behaviors across those sites. Or, in other words, <strong>modern Web browsers can absolutely prevent Mom from telling Dad your secrets</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, we acknowledge that some companies do try to circumvent the privacy protections in Web browsers, to try and allow two sites run by the same organization to link your accounts across sites. Some sites use techniques like link decoration or bounce tracking to try and continue tracking you. But the difference here between privacy respecting browsers (which include <a href="https://brave.com/research/measuring-uid-smuggling-in-the-wild/">link decoration</a> and <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates/16-unlinkable-bouncing/">bounce tracking</a> protections) and Chrome (which is explicitly designed to allow cross-site linkage) is damning: <strong>some browsers are experimenting with techniques to prevent organizations from tracking you across sites, and some browsers are designing features with the explicit intent of allowing such tracking</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>In conclusion, our study finds that RWS is harmful for Web privacy, and in three ways:</p>
<p>First, RWS assumes users can anticipate which sites are related to each other, but in practice users cannot.</p>
<p>Second, RWS introduces privacy harm even <em>before users have the the opportunity</em> to decide if two sites are operated by the same organization; by the time users can view a webpage to try and decide if two sites are related to each other, the privacy harm has already occurred, and sites have had the opportunity to track the user across site boundaries.</p>
<p>And third, RWS entrenches a privacy-harmful assumption in the Web platform, instead of working to excise it. RWS assumes that if two sites are owned by the same organization, then the organization should be allowed to track you across those two sites. In contrast, privacy respecting browsers have gone in the opposite direction, and <a href="https://brave.com/web-standards-at-brave/8-first-party-sets/">tried to prevent all sites from tracking you</a>, regardless of what organization owns them.</p>




<p>Although Related Website Sets is being presented as a general Web proposal, the truth is that most of the Web has already considered and rejected it. Most browsers, including <a href="https://brave.com/web-standards-at-brave/8-first-party-sets/">Brave</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/350" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/93#issuecomment-1357694422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Safari</a>, have publicly stated that they believe Related Website Sets (previously called First-Party Sets) is bad for users, and bad for the Web. The proposal has been removed from the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-privacycg/2022Jun/0003.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">W3C Privacy Community Group</a> and is no longer being considered by any privacy-focused group in the W3C.</p>

<h3 id="when-websites-change-of-hands">When Websites Change of Hands</h3>
<p>What happens if / when the domains in the list change hands? This is a common concern with all sorts of “pin trust to a domain” proposals across this history of the Web. Just because domains A, B, and C are operated by the same organization today does not (at all) guarantee that they’ll be owned by the same organization tomorrow.</p>
<p>Security and privacy attacks from exactly these kinds of assumptions have happened with browser extensions that have been sold from “trustworthy” parties to malicious parties, or when popular software libraries / dependencies have been taken over by a malicious actor.</p>
<p>The broader concern is that, <em>even if</em> these sites are meaningfully related at the time they’re included in the list, there is no mechanism that will remove them when they (often silently) change hands.</p>

<h3 id="language--perception-concerns">Language / Perception Concerns</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the underlying justification (as flimsy as it is) for RWS is that users can perceive that they’re operated by the same organization. Our study finds that, even for English speaking users evaluating English sites, users can’t anticipate what sites Google judges to be related. This problem will (of course) get much worse when people are visiting sites in languages they do not speak.</p>

<h3 id="timing">Timing</h3>
<p>The intuition behind RWS is that users will be able to determine if site B is related to site A, and then only visit site B if that arrangement is acceptable. However, this is a catch 22. In order to determine if site B is related to site A, I need to visit site B and see the “<a href="https://github.com/WICG/first-party-sets?tab=readme-ov-file#defining-a-set-through-use-case-based-subsets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared branding or logo</a>” (or similar), indicating the relationship between these sites. However, once I’ve loaded the site to view it, it’s already too late, and my information has been shared between the two sites.</p>

As we did with our <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-update/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>Llama 3</u></a> and <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-2-update/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>Llama 2</u></a> releases, today we’re sharing an update on the momentum and adoption we’re seeing across the board.</p><p>The success of Llama is made possible through the power of open source. By making our Llama models openly available we’ve seen a vibrant and diverse AI ecosystem come to life where developers have more choice and capability than ever before. The innovation has been broad and rapid, from start-ups pushing new boundaries to enterprises of all sizes using Llama to build on-premises or through a cloud service provider. Industry is building and innovating with Llama, and we’re even more excited for what’s to come.</p><p>Alongside the release of Llama 3.1, Mark Zuckerberg shared an <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/open-source-ai-is-the-path-forward/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>open letter on the benefits of open source AI</u></a>—further cementing our vision and commitment to an open approach. Open source is in our company’s DNA, and Llama both embodies and reinforces our commitment to sharing our work in a responsible way.

With Llama 3.1, we now offer developers a complete reference system to more easily create their own custom agents along with a new set of <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1-ai-responsibility/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>security and safety tools</u></a> to help build responsibly.</p></div></div><div><p>The leading open source model</p><div><p>The Llama ecosystem is growing rapidly. Llama models are approaching 350 million downloads on Hugging Face to date—an over 10x increase from where we were about a year ago. Llama models were downloaded more than 20 million times on Hugging Face in the last month alone. And this is just one piece of the Llama success story with these models also being downloaded on services from our partners across the industry.</p><p>In addition to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft’s Azure, we’ve partnered with Databricks, Dell, Google Cloud, Groq, NVIDIA, IBM watsonx, Scale AI, Snowflake, and others to better help developers unlock the full potential of our models. Hosted Llama usage by token volume across our major cloud service provider partners more than doubled May through July 2024 when we released Llama 3.1.</p></div><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/457433486_1172228880678879_7281450415882253261_n.png?_nc_cat=111&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=e280be&amp;_nc_ohc=shEElU7Sp_oQ7kNvgEWwBq_&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;_nc_gid=AKokw5Mi-vmy5mfC1ewevwM&amp;oh=00_AYDE9uqjhTqqedmD-kTd1sc5HOqpiyAkMs6Tyg67hPz0YA&amp;oe=66EB18EB" alt="" id="u_0_4_Ro"></p><div><p>Monthly usage of Llama grew 10x from January to July 2024 for some of our largest cloud service providers. And in the month of August, the highest number of unique users of Llama 3.1 on one of our major cloud service provider partners was the 405B variant, which shows that our largest foundation model is gaining traction.</p><p>We’ve grown the number of partners in our Llama early access program by 5x with Llama 3.1 and will do more to meet the surging demand from partners. We’ve heard from a number of companies that want to be future LEAP and integration Llama partners, including Wipro, Cerebras, and Lambda.</p><p><b>Swami Sivasubramanian, VP, AI and Data, AWS:</b> “Customers want access to the latest state-of-the-art models for building AI applications in the cloud, which is why we were the first to offer Llama 2 as a managed API and have continued to work closely with Meta as they released new models. We’ve been excited to see the uptake for Llama 3.1 from customers across both Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock, and we look forward to seeing how customers use this model to solve their most complex use cases.”</p><p><b>Ali Ghodsi, CEO &amp; Co-Founder, Databricks: </b>“In the weeks since launch, thousands of Databricks customers have adopted Llama 3.1, making it our fastest adopted and best selling open source model ever. This generation of Llama models finally bridges the gap between OSS and commercial models on quality. Llama 3.1 is a breakthrough for customers wanting to build high quality AI applications, while retaining full control, customizability, and portability over their base LLM.”</p><p><b>Jonathan Ross, Founder &amp; CEO, Groq: </b>“Open-source wins. Meta is building the foundation of an open ecosystem that rivals the top closed models and at Groq we put them directly into the hands of the developers—a shared value that’s been fundamental at Groq since our beginning. To date Groq has provided over 400,000 developers with 5 billion free tokens daily, using the Llama suite of models and our LPU Inference. It’s a very exciting time and we’re proud to be a part of that momentum. We can’t add capacity fast enough for Llama. If we 10x’d the deployed capacity it would be consumed in under 36 hours.”</p><p><b>Jensen Huang, Founder &amp; CEO of NVIDIA: </b>“Llama has profoundly impacted the advancement of state-of-the-art AI. The floodgates are now open for every enterprise and industry to build and deploy custom Llama supermodels using NVIDIA AI Foundry, which offers the broadest support for Llama 3.1 models across training, optimization, and inference. It’s incredible to witness the rapid pace of adoption in just the past month.”</p><p><b><i>What's even more encouraging than how many people are using Llama is who is using Llama and how they’re using Llama.</i></b></p><p>We’re seeing growing preference in the developer community for Llama and strong indicators for continued growth. According to a survey from Artificial Analysis, an independent site for AI benchmarking, Llama was the number two most considered model and the industry leader in open source.</p><p>With more than 60,000 derivative models on Hugging Face, there’s a vibrant community of developers fine-tuning Llama for their own use cases. Large enterprises like AT&amp;T, DoorDash, Goldman Sachs, Niantic, Nomura, Shopify, Spotify, and Zoom are just a few success stories, and both Infosys and KPMG are using Llama internally.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look.</p></div><p>A snapshot of Llama case studies</p><div><p><b>Accenture</b> is using Llama 3.1 to build a custom LLM for ESG reporting that they expect to improve productivity by 70% and quality by 20 – 30%, compared with the company’s existing way of generating Accenture’s annual ESG report. With its exciting advancements in multilingual capabilities, Accenture is able to extend AI models across regions, for example to help a global organization make chatbots more culturally conscious and relevant. Accenture believes companies will need to leverage many different AI models from different providers. Open source models like Llama 3.1 expand options, accelerate innovation, and will have a positive ripple effect across business and society.</p><p>Customer care is an area of focus for AI-powered innovation at <b>AT&amp;T</b>. Through fine-tuning Llama models, they’ve been able to cost effectively improve customer care by better understanding key trends, needs and opportunities to enhance the experience moving forward. Overall, Llama and GenAI have driven a nearly 33% improvement in search-related responses for AT&amp;T customer care engagements while reducing costs and speeding up response times.</p><p><b>DoorDash</b> uses Llama to streamline and accelerate daily tasks for its software engineers, such as leveraging its internal knowledge base to answer complex questions for the team and delivering actionable pull request reviews to improve its codebase.</p><p><b>Goldman Sachs</b> AI platform, known as the GS AI Platform, allows Goldman engineers to use Llama models for various use cases in a safe and responsible way, including information extraction from documents.</p><p>To drive the virtual world of its first-of-its-kind AR game Peridot, <b>Niantic</b> integrated Llama, transforming its adorable creatures, called “Dots,” into responsive AR pets that now exhibit smart behaviors to simulate the unpredictable nature of physical animals. Llama generates each Dot’s reaction in real time, making every interaction dynamic and unique.</p><p>Leading Japanese financial institution <b>Nomura</b> uses Llama on AWS for key benefits, including faster innovation, transparency, bias guardrails, and robust performance across text summarization, code generation, log analysis, and document processing.</p><p><b>Shopify</b> is continuing to experiment with best-in-class open source models, including LLaVA, which is built on the foundations of Llama. They use finetunes of LLaVA for multiple specialized tasks and are currently doing 40M – 60M Llava inferences per day supporting the company’s work on product metadata and enrichment.</p><p><b>Zoom</b> uses its own models as well as closed- and open-source LLMs—including Llama—to power its AI Companion, a generative AI assistant that helps workers avoid repetitive, mundane tasks. AI Companion serves up meeting summaries, smart recordings, and next steps to Zoom users, freeing up more of their time to collaborate, make connections, and get things done.</p></div></div><div><p>A thriving open system</p><div><p>Llama is leading the way on openness, modifiability, and cost efficiency.

Labor cost usually increases, while steel, aluminium, wires, and the like are unlikely to go down.</p><p><span>But remember: They’ve never been optimized! Our paradigm was: “</span><em>Do whatever you need to get the most out of every solar panel!”</em><span> If we change that paradigm and now the panels are dirt cheap, how would we completely rethink the installation?</span></p><p>Here’s one example: Historically, solar panel makers have reduced the cost of solar energy by making their panels collect sunlight more efficiently. Now that installation is such a big share of costs, they have started redesigning their panels to reduce these BOS costs. One example of recent redesign is bigger panels: The bigger each panel is, the less rack and wiring it needs.</p><p>Or think about the entire structure: trackers to pivot the panels to follow the Sun, racks high up to allow room for that movement and to protect the panels from ground-level hazards, strong pilings deep in the ground to hold all this weight…&nbsp;</p><p>But if your panels are cheap, you can basically dump them on the ground! No pilings, no racks, no trackers. Barely any SBOS! And since you don’t have heavy materials to transport, your logistics costs drop and you barely need any civil engineering: No need for big trucks to enter the farm, no need for infinite trenches to hide cables underground.</p><p>And this is not a pie in the sky. Some companies are doing it already, like Erthos:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa15ae5bf-9f0a-4c15-b750-34c0de9fe6b8_626x500.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa15ae5bf-9f0a-4c15-b750-34c0de9fe6b8_626x500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa15ae5bf-9f0a-4c15-b750-34c0de9fe6b8_626x500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa15ae5bf-9f0a-4c15-b750-34c0de9fe6b8_626x500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa15ae5bf-9f0a-4c15-b750-34c0de9fe6b8_626x500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa15ae5bf-9f0a-4c15-b750-34c0de9fe6b8_626x500.png" width="626" height="500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a15ae5bf-9f0a-4c15-b750-34c0de9fe6b8_626x500.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:626,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa15ae5bf-9f0a-4c15-b750-34c0de9fe6b8_626x500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa15ae5bf-9f0a-4c15-b750-34c0de9fe6b8_626x500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa15ae5bf-9f0a-4c15-b750-34c0de9fe6b8_626x500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa15ae5bf-9f0a-4c15-b750-34c0de9fe6b8_626x500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>The company doesn’t share much detail, but it appears that the panels are on some kind of rail system.

Adding multiple layers optimized for different wavelengths can theoretically raise efficiency up to 68%. Using technology other than today's p-n junction cells could reach theoretical efficiencies of 90%+. It would be a significant achievement to get mass-produced efficiencies up to 25% for single layer and 40% for multi-layer p-n junction panels.

It’s the one thing we can’t make more of, and yet there are more and more humans on Earth. Fixed supply and increasing demand means growing price. So the cost of solar farms will converge towards the cost of land.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of that, the best sites are already taken. Future ones might need to be more expensive or farther out—which increases costs in other ways.</p><p>On the other side, in most places, land is plentiful and cheap. And the same force as the one we’ve shared before will come into play: As solar farm costs shrink, land will become a bigger share of the cost, so solar farm operators will have a much stronger incentive to seek the cheapest land. These places will get plenty of solar panels, thus keeping overall solar prices low.</p><p>One of the big advantages of solar photovoltaic is how fast its cycles are. It doesn’t take long to set up a solar farm, and it’s cheap to build, so the learning loops are very fast, and hence cost reductions tend to be achieved much faster than in other industries, like nuclear.&nbsp;</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/can-solar-costs-keep-shrinking?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/can-solar-costs-keep-shrinking?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>If you add up all these costs, you can expect in a few years:</p><ul><li><p><span>Solar panel costs that shrink from $0.39 to $0.05 per watt</span><sub>DC</sub><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Buildup costs (design, engineering, civil engineering, balance of system, direct labor, and inverter) going from about $0.47/watt</span><sub>DC</sub><span> to ~$0.10/watt</span><sub>DC</sub><span>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://friendshipcastle.zip/blog/glaceon">https://friendshipcastle.zip/blog/glaceon</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41390412">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I like self-hosting things when I can. I have a little server running <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a> at home that I run stuff on. I also have a few things in the cloud on <a href="https://fly.io/">fly.io</a> (those cheap L40ses are great btw). I wanted my workloads on k3s to access the AI server on fly, but I didn't want to set up a VPN to my private network because mixing VPNs and Kubernetes is painful. I also didn't want to expose the AI server to the internet because it's not really meant to be public, and every time it gets poked, it costs me money.</p>
<p>Who says you need to do networking in the kernel though? Networking is just a program that takes in bytes and sometimes puts out different bytes. It's usually exposed to programs via the kernel and system calls, but there's nothing stopping you from doing it in userspace. This'd give you all the fun of fucking about with the network but none of those pesky sudo commands or risks of breaking your network stack until you reboot.</p>
<p>So I looked around and found <a href="https://friendshipcastle.zip/blog/golang.zx2c4.com/wireguard/tun/netstack">wireguard-go has support for netstack</a>, a userspace TCP/IP stack for Go programs. It's pretty poorly documented, but I figured out I could dial sockets once I loaded it with config and messed around with the "uapi" a bit. I had to bring in an ini parser to load the WireGuard configs, which is probably wrong, but it works enough.</p>
<p>Figuring out how to do that was a huge pain. I had to <code>strace</code> the <code>wg-quick</code> command and everything it was doing, but eventually I got the wire form of the config and I was able to make HTTP requests. I also found out that the uapi form had to pre-resolve DNS addresses, the hard way, of course.</p>
<p>I got things working and published it on the GitHubs as <a href="https://github.com/Twi/glaceon"><code>glaceon</code></a>. It's a Go program that exposes an HTTP reverse proxy to a given remote host over WireGuard. It's also the most minimal example I can find for how to use wireguard-go from userspace. Maybe how this works is is worth documenting in another post.</p>
<p>I was just spawning them manually on k3s when I was told that <a href="https://sdk.operatorframework.io/">operator-sdk</a> would let me make <a href="https://github.com/Twi/glaceon-operator">my own operator</a>. This is an opinionated template that makes it easy to program Kubernetes operators based on "best practices". I kinda hate working with the Go in this framework, but at the very least everything is separated out and all the concerns are easily understood.</p>
<p>Once it was working, I was able to do something incredibly cheeky:</p>
<pre lang="yaml"><code>apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: flycast
---
apiVersion: glaceon.friendshipcastle.zip/v1alpha1
kind: MachineProxy
metadata:
  name: twi-ollama
  namespace: flycast
spec:
  org: personal
  region: yyz
  target: http://twi-ollama.flycast
  port: 80
</code></pre>
<p>This let my apps access my Ollama server via <code>http://twi-ollama.flycast</code> in k3s, just like they can on fly.</p>
<h2>Installing</h2>
<p>Installing this is easy. First, install the operator:</p>
<pre lang="sh"><code>kubectl apply -f \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Twi/glaceon-operator/main/config/rendered.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>Then create a token for the fly org you want to expose to your Kubernetes cluster:</p>
<pre lang="sh"><code>fly tokens create org personal
</code></pre>
<p>Copy that into the Kubernetes secret <code>glaceon-operator</code> in the namespace <code>glaceon-operator-system</code> with the name <code>FLY_API_TOKEN</code>:</p>
<pre lang="sh"><code>kubectl create secret generic \
  glaceon-operator \
  --from-literal=FLY_API_TOKEN=&lt;your-token-value&gt; \
  -n glaceon-operator-system
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can create a MachineProxy resource:</p>
<pre lang="sh"><code>cat &lt;&lt;'EOF' | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: glaceon.friendshipcastle.zip/v1alpha1
kind: MachineProxy
metadata:
  name: twi-ollama
  namespace: flycast
spec:
  org: personal
  region: yyz
  target: http://twi-ollama.flycast
  port: 80
EOF
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it!</p>

<p><em>Updated Aug. 28, 2024</em>.</p>



<h2>Take back your privacy</h2>



<p><strong>Firefox is rolling out Total Cookie Protection by default to more Firefox users worldwide, making Firefox the most private and secure major browser available across Windows, Mac, Linux and Android. </strong><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/products/firefox/firefox-tips/internet-safety-for-families-total-cookie-protection/">Total Cookie Protection</a> is Firefox’s strongest privacy protection to date, confining cookies to the site where they were created, thus preventing tracking companies from using these cookies to track your browsing from site to site.</p>



<p>Whether it’s <a href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/04/28/applied-for-student-aid-online-facebook-saw-you">applying for a student loan</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/health-site-ad-tracking/">seeking treatment or advice through a health site</a>, or <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/grindr-user-data-has-been-for-sale-for-years-11651492800?mod=hp_lead_pos4">browsing an online dating app</a>, massive amounts of your personal information is online — and this data is leaking all over the web. The hyper-specific-to-you ads you so often see online are made possible by cookies that are used to track your behavior across sites and build an extremely sophisticated profile of who you are.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22587248/grindr-app-location-data-outed-priest-jeffrey-burrill-pillar-data-harvesting">Stories</a> (including an excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqn3gR1WTcA&amp;ab_channel=LastWeekTonight">Last Week Tonight</a> episode) have shown how robust, yet under-the-radar, the data selling economy is and how easy it is for anyone to buy your data, combine it with more data about you and use it for a variety of purposes, even beyond advertising.</p>



<p>It’s an alarming reality — the possibility that your every move online is being watched, tracked and shared — and one that’s antithetical to the open web we at Mozilla have strived to build. That’s why we developed Total Cookie Protection to help keep you safe online.</p>







<p>Total Cookie Protection offers strong protections against tracking without affecting your browsing experience.</p>

<p>Total Cookie Protection works by creating a separate “cookie jar” for each website you visit. Instead of allowing trackers to link up your behavior on multiple sites, they just get to see behavior on individual sites. Any time a website, or <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/third-party-cookies-firefox-tracking-protection#:~:text=Third%2Dparty%20cookies%20are%20cookies,considered%20a%20third%2Dparty%20cookie.">third-party content</a> embedded in a website, deposits a cookie in your browser, that cookie is confined to the cookie jar assigned to <em>only </em>that website. No other websites can reach into the cookie jars that don’t belong to them and find out what the other websites’ cookies know about you — giving you freedom from invasive ads and reducing the amount of information companies gather about you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This approach strikes the balance between eliminating the worst privacy properties of third-party cookies – in particular the ability to track you – and allowing those cookies to fulfill their less invasive use cases (e.g. to provide accurate analytics). With Total Cookie Protection in Firefox, people can enjoy better privacy and<strong> </strong>have the great browsing experience they’ve come to expect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Total Cookie Protection offers additional privacy protections beyond those provided by our existing anti-tracking features. Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP), which we launched in 2018, works by blocking trackers based on a maintained list. If a party is on that list, they lose the ability to use third-party cookies. ETP was a huge privacy win for Firefox users, but we’ve known this approach has some shortcomings. If a tracker for some reason isn’t on that list, they can still track users and violate their privacy. And if an attacker wants to thwart ETP, they can set up a new tracking domain that isn’t on the list. Total Cookie Protection avoids these problems by restricting the functionality for <strong>all</strong> cookies, not just for those on a defined list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>A culmination of years of anti-tracking work</strong></h2>



<p>Total Cookie Protection is the culmination of years of work to fight the privacy catastrophe that stems from online trackers. We first began to block tracking in 2015 with the release of <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-now-offers-a-more-private-browsing-experience/">Tracking Protection</a>, a feature people could turn on by going into Private Browsing mode. We recognized at that time that browser makers couldn’t just sit back and let their users be abused. In 2018, we introduced <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/latest-firefox-rolls-out-enhanced-tracking-protection/">Enhanced Tracking Protection</a> and turned it on <strong>by default</strong> for all Firefox users in 2019, reflecting our commitment to actively protect our users rather than expect them to protect themselves. Since then, we have continued to make progress towards blocking trackers and ending cross-site tracking by introducing protections against <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/features/block-fingerprinting/">fingerprinting </a>and <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/01/26/supercookie-protections/">supercookies</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The release of Total Cookie Protection is the result of experimentation and feature testing, first in <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/02/23/total-cookie-protection/">ETP Strict Mode</a> and <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/06/01/total-cookie-protection-in-private-browsing/">Private Browsing</a> windows, then in <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/new-privacy-protection-for-firefox-focus-on-android/#:~:text=Focus%20on%20Android.-,Total%20Cookie%20Protection%20works%20by%20maintaining%20a%20separate%20%E2%80%9Ccookie%20jar,jar%20assigned%20to%20that%20website.">Firefox Focus</a> earlier this year. We’re now making it a default feature for <strong>all </strong>Firefox desktop users worldwide.</p>



<p>Our long history of fighting online tracking manifests itself in our advocacy to <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2019/12/31/bringing-californias-privacy-law-to-all-firefox-users-in-2020/">policy</a> <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2017/05/09/eprivacy/">makers</a> and other <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/open-letter-to-venmo-make-privacy-the-default/">tech</a> <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/the-bug-in-apples-latest-marketing-campaign/">companies</a> to reinforce their own privacy protections. We also push to make <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/privacy-preserving-attribution-for-advertising/">privacy an industry priority</a> through our efforts in industry <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/patcg/">standards</a> bodies when shaping the future of online advertising. Furthermore, we created <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/about/why/">the Privacy Not Included guide</a> to simplify the very complicated privacy landscape and help consumers shop smarter and safer for products that connect to the internet.</p>



<p>Over more than a decade, Mozilla has proudly been leading the fight to build a more private internet. While bringing Total Cookie Protection to more Firefox users has been one significant step in this journey, we have still kept our sights on an even safer, even better internet. And starting in 2024, all our users can look forward to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/goodbye-third-party-cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Firefox blocking even more third party cookies</a>. That’s right; we are taking big swings to adopt new cookie partitioning and clearing mechanisms so that users can browse with fewer cookies that won’t stick around as long and will result in an even better browsing experience. Just another step on our road towards creating a better internet where your privacy is not optional.</p>

And the world would have been a lot different if we'd done it …"</p><p><em>Paul Otellini, Intel CEO, 2013</em></p></blockquote><p><span>There is a bittersweet quality to the late Paul Otellini’s 2013 valedictory </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/05/paul-otellinis-intel-can-the-company-that-built-the-future-survive-it/275825/" rel="">final interview</a><span> as CEO of Intel for Alexis Madrigal in the Atlantic. The company's achievements under his leadership, set out in the interview, were undoubtedly impressive:</span></p><blockquote><p>Under his watch since 2005, it created the world's best chips for laptops, assumed a dominant position in the server market, vanquished long-time rival AMD, retained a vertically integrated business model that's unique in the industry, and&nbsp;maintained profitability throughout the global economic meltdown.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>… he delivered quarter after quarter of profits along increasing revenue. In the last full year before he ascended to chief executive, Intel generated $34 billion in sales. By 2012, that number had grown to $53 billion.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The $11 billion Intel earned in 2012 easily beats the sum total ($9.5) posted by Qualcomm ($6.1), Texas Instruments ($1.8), Broadcom ($0.72), Nvidia ($0.56), and Marvell ($0.31), not to mention its old rival AMD, which lost more than a billion dollars.</p></blockquote><p>And yet, one ‘miss’ hangs over the whole narrative:</p><blockquote><p>But, oh, what could have been! Even Otellini betrayed a profound sense of disappointment over a decision he made about a then-unreleased product that became the iPhone.</p></blockquote><p><em>The iPhone!</em></p><blockquote><p>Every once in a while a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything.</p><p><em><span>Steve Jobs, 2007</span><a href="https://youtu.be/VQKMoT-6XSg?si=abE3-KHBrfePMQU6" rel=""> WWDC Keynote</a></em></p></blockquote><p>Steve Jobs’s introduction to the Keynote that launched the iPhone might have initially seemed like hyperbole. But any sense of exaggeration soon disappeared. In 2013, the year of Otellini’s departure from Intel, Apple would sell 150 million iPhones helping it generate over $170bn in sales and $37bn in profits, far surpassing Intel’s results.</p><p>The most important silicon in 2013’s iPhone 5S, the A7 System-on-Chip (SoC) was made, not by Intel, but by Korean rival Samsung. The SoC contains the processor that runs user apps - the ‘application processor’ - and lots of other silicon powering graphics and much more. The SoC is almost always the most complex chip in a modern smartphone. </p><p>A year later, Apple switched the manufacturing of the A7’s successors to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), providing TSMC with a huge revenue stream. By the late 2010s, over half of the Taiwanese company’s revenue would come from making smartphone chips. That revenue—particularly from Apple—provided essential support for TSMC’s investments in new and more advanced fabs. Fabs that would take Intel’s decades-long crown as technology leader in ‘logic’ integrated circuits.</p><p>By 2013 the importance of this ‘miss’ for Intel was clear to all, not least Otellini. The Atlantic article is prophetically titled “Can the Company That Built the Future Survive It?” </p><p>In 2024, the survival of Intel is a pressing issue, not just for shareholders and employees, but for the United States as a semiconductor technology leader.  </p><p>How did this happen? How could Intel miss such an important opportunity? </p><p>In the Atlantic article, Otellini frames it as a personal decision based purely on financial terms:</p><blockquote><p><span>The thing you have to remember is that this was before the iPhone was introduced and no one knew what the iPhone would do... At the end of the day, </span><strong>there was a chip that they were interested in that they wanted to pay a certain price for and not a nickel more and that price was below our forecasted cost.</strong><span> </span><strong>I couldn't see it.</strong><span> It wasn't one of these things you can make up on volume. And in hindsight, the forecasted cost was wrong and the volume was 100x what anyone thought [my emphasis].</span></p></blockquote><p>There is a mythology about Intel’s iPhone ‘miss’.  It’s a mythology about how Intel couldn’t see the iPhone’s potential and so ‘turned it down’ in a decision driven purely by the financials of a possible deal. In other words, a classic case of ‘disruption’, with an incumbent hooked on high prices and margins and disinterested in a simpler and cheaper product.</p><p><span>A Vox </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/4/20/11463818/intel-iphone-mobile-revolution" rel="">article</a><span> from 2016 provides a good example - probably strongly influenced by Otellini’s comments - of how Intel’s smartphone miss is often presented:</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Intel’s decline is a classic story of disruptive innovation …</strong></p><p>With many companies selling ARM chips, prices were low and profit margins were slim. It would have been a struggle for Intel to slim down enough to turn a profit in this market.</p><p>And in any event, Intel was making plenty of money selling high-end PC chips. There didn’t seem to be much reason to fight for a market where the opportunity just didn’t seem that big.</p></blockquote><p><span>Or take </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/17/how-intel-missed-the-iphone-revolution/" rel="">TechCrunch’s </a><span> analysis also from 2016 - complete with a link to Otellini’s Atlantic article:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>By the time ARM was gaining traction and Jobs had secretly gone to work on the iPhone, Intel was thoroughly addicted to its fat margins. Thus it was no surprise that Intel passed Steve Jobs’ suggestion that they fabricate an ARM chip for the iPhone. Intel didn’t want to be in the low-margin business of providing phone CPUs, and it had no idea that the iPhone would be the biggest technological revolution since the original IBM PC. So Intel’s CEO at the time, Paul Otellini, politely </span><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/05/paul-otellinis-intel-can-the-company-that-built-the-future-survive-it/275825/" rel="">declined</a><span>.</span></p></blockquote><p><em><strong>First, it’s not true that Intel had little interest in the market for phone chips.</strong></em><span> </span></p><p>At the time of the iPhone’s launch, it had already invested heavily in trying to break into the smartphone market. It would continue doing so for many years afterward when it was clear that the opportunity was ‘big’.</p><p><em><strong>Second, if any company and CEO had the concept of disruption in their DNA, then it was Intel and Otellini.</strong></em><span> </span></p><p><span>Andy Grove, Intel’s CEO between 1987 and 1997, worked closely with Clayton Christensen, who devised the concept. Christensen wrote a warm </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/03/clayton-christensen-what-ill-miss-about-andy-grove" rel="">tribute</a><span> to Grove when he passed away in 2016, one that emphasized their discussions on disruption:</span></p><blockquote><p>When Intel’s microprocessor business was being threatened by low-cost competitors, he asked me what to do about it. But instead of telling him how to respond, I gave him what he really wanted: I laid out the theory of disruption for him and his team so that they could predict the next threat — or opportunity — in their path.</p></blockquote><p>Otellini had served as Grove's technical assistant early in his career. Even though Grove had, by the mid-2000s, been long retired, it’s hard to believe that Otellini, as a relatively new CEO, didn’t seek the counsel of his former mentor on a crucial decision like this. Or that Grove didn’t pick up the phone to his protege.</p><p>Otellini later recalled in the Atlantic interview how in 2005 [around the time of discussions with Apple] he had started to try to “… get Intel to start thinking about ultracheap [chips for $10 or less]” on the basis that there would be sales of billions of computing devices with these chips. Intel was already creating cellphone chips that sold for between $10 and $20, so this was not that much of a leap. It’s hard to believe that he would turn down such an opportunity when he knew that Intel had to start to make less expensive chips.</p><p>As a final hole in the, ‘it was all about price and Intel couldn’t or wouldn’t compete’ argument, we’ll see later that Intel did get one chip into the first iPhone - a memory chip that was probably more price-sensitive than the SoC.</p><p><em><strong>Thirdly, the success of an Apple phone would not have been hard to predict. </strong></em></p><p>In 2006 Apple sold nearly 40 million iPods. The world was waiting expectantly for Apple to launch a mobile phone. Otellini (and Grove) must have seen the possibility that a new phone from Apple might be a runaway success.</p><p><em><strong>Finally, it gives no weight to the quality and suitability of Intel’s technology compared to its competitors</strong></em><span>. </span></p><p>Is it credible to think Apple was solely driven by price for a vital component of its most important product in decades? If Intel had the best technology would they have been turned away purely to save a few nickels? The narrative also denies credit to Intel’s competitors in the ARM ecosystem for their response to Intel’s attempts to enter the phone market. </p><p><strong>This leaves lots of questions. What happened in the discussions between Intel and Apple? How could a company acutely aware of the risk of being disrupted, miss the iPhone? Why did Otellini, in his Atlantic interview, frame the decision as one solely based on price?</strong></p><p>Part of the answer to the final question, perhaps, is that Otellini was acting as a lightning rod for criticism. He was creating a narrative that the problem had been costs, faulty forecasting, and the departing CEO’s vision and decision-making. It was not a problem with Intel or its technology. Intel could still succeed in the smartphone SoC market under new CEO Brian Kzranich.</p><p>But if this narrative is questionable, why did Intel miss out on the smartphone market? Scratch the surface and it’s a much more complex and interesting story than the conventional narrative. Rather than one questionable decision, it is a story of a series of missed opportunities, and multiple strategic errors, combined with bad luck and poor timing over almost two decades. It’s a story where Intel had the technology that it needed to be successful in the phone market but, driven by a combination of lack of patience and hubris, gave it away.</p><p>In the first part of this article, we’ll outline the story of Intel’s efforts in the phone market leading up to the launch of the iPhone.

DEC promoted the Alpha as the world’s fastest commercially available microprocessor.</p><blockquote><p>The fastest commercial reduced-instruction-set computer (RISC) chip around today is based on a new, 64-bit architecture called Alpha. Designed and manufactured by Digital Equipment Corp., the chip works at a clock speed of 200 MHz, making it twice as fast as any previously delivered microprocessor.</p><p><em>IEEE Spectrum, How DEC developed Alpha, July 1992</em></p></blockquote><p>Intel’s fastest design at the time was the 80486DX2, with a maximum clock speed of just 66MHz. </p><p>But the Alpha’s performance came at a price: power consumption that made it unsuitable for lower power applications.</p><p>Dan Dobberpuhl and colleagues at DEC on the Alpha team, inspired by work at UC Berkeley on low-power devices, started to look at the possibility of making a lower-power version of the Alpha. Initial results were promising:</p><blockquote><p>So we reduced the VDD supply from 2.5V to 1.5V. As a result we got a pretty decent performance/power ratio on an Alpha chip. As I recall, the frequency went down to about 100 megahertz from 200, but the power was down to less than 5 watts from the original 30.</p></blockquote><p>At the same time, a group of DEC engineers based in Austin, Texas was approaching the challenge from the opposite direction, by exploring how to ‘soup-up’ an existing low-power RISC architecture. In the end, the Austin team’s approach won out:</p><blockquote><p>Well, the low-power Alpha turned out to be an interesting technical idea but not an interesting marketing and business idea, because the whole premise of Alpha was high performance. Doing anything of lesser performance didn’t seem to make a whole lot of sense.</p></blockquote><p>But which existing low-power RISC architecture? There were several alternatives including MIPS and Hitachi’s Super-H, but the team eventually settled on ARM. Not the least of the advantages of using ARM was that there was an existing ARM customer with a thirst for more powerful designs: Apple Computer who were using ARM designs in the Newton. With Apple as an ARM shareholder, they could pressure ARM to license the architecture to DEC. Not that pressure was probably needed, with ARM’s management focused on expanding its licensee base rather than building more powerful chips for Apple. A deal was struck between ARM and DEC with a new kind of license, for DEC to design chips using the ARM ISA, which would become known as an ‘Architecture License’.</p><p>DEC’s Alpha team, based in Austin and Palo Alto, was soon working with ARM engineers to create the StrongARM series of processors. The first fruit of that collaboration was the SA-110, announced in February 1996.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8f74802-8ba6-4726-a8ae-9f5eb38fb543_330x330.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8f74802-8ba6-4726-a8ae-9f5eb38fb543_330x330.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8f74802-8ba6-4726-a8ae-9f5eb38fb543_330x330.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8f74802-8ba6-4726-a8ae-9f5eb38fb543_330x330.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8f74802-8ba6-4726-a8ae-9f5eb38fb543_330x330.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8f74802-8ba6-4726-a8ae-9f5eb38fb543_330x330.jpeg" width="330" height="330" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e8f74802-8ba6-4726-a8ae-9f5eb38fb543_330x330.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:330,&quot;width&quot;:330,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:16208,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8f74802-8ba6-4726-a8ae-9f5eb38fb543_330x330.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8f74802-8ba6-4726-a8ae-9f5eb38fb543_330x330.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8f74802-8ba6-4726-a8ae-9f5eb38fb543_330x330.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8f74802-8ba6-4726-a8ae-9f5eb38fb543_330x330.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>StrongARM SA-110S - CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=241552</figcaption></figure></div><p>The market the StrongArm team was aiming for was clear from the paper that introduced the new design:</p><blockquote><p>As personal digital assistants (PDA’s) move into the next generation, there is an obvious need for additional processing power to enable new applications and improve existing ones.

For all their technical prowess the Alpha microprocessors were making limited headway against Intel’s - rapidly improving - designs.</p><p><span>In May 1997 DEC sued Intel, alleging that the Pentium processor infringed on several of DEC’s Alpha patents. Wired </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160314015908/http://www.wired.com/1997/10/intel-dec-settle-alpha-chip-dispute/" rel="">reported</a><span> that:</span></p><blockquote><p>DEC has claimed that it approached Intel about working together on the chip technology in 1990 and later offered to license the Alpha technology to Intel for use in improving the performance of its chips. DEC said Intel studied the chip, but decided not to go with it.</p></blockquote><p>Intel countersued, alleging that DEC had misappropriated trade secrets and had infringed Intel’s patents.</p><p>In August 1997, the two companies settled, reaching an agreement where DEC sold its semiconductor manufacturing operations and the StrongARM business to Intel for $700m. It was a deal that worked for both sides. DEC divested its uncompetitive fabs and Intel acquired the successful StrongARM business, as a potential replacement for its aging i860 and i960 RISC designs.</p><p>But there was a twist to the inclusion of StrongARM in the sale. Might Intel, as owner of the powerful StrongARM designs, pose a threat to ARM’s business? </p><p><span>Robin Saxby, ARM’s CEO at the time, has </span><a href="https://youtu.be/FO5PsAY5aaI?feature=shared&amp;t=4319" rel="">recalled</a><span> a conversation with Steve Jobs, still a major ARM shareholder, but no longer a major customer:</span></p><blockquote><p>Intel acquired Digital and Intel got the rights to the Arm license through that contract … I had to get board approval on every deal. I discussed it with Apple and basically Steve Jobs … sorry he's not around anymore … was not in favor of licensing Intel and tried to stop me doing it. I spoke to him on the phone and he said you're the Chief Executive of ARM Robin, who am I to argue with you and he approved the deal.</p></blockquote><p>And here, although Saxby’s view prevailed, there was a credible argument to be made against transferring the architecture license to Intel. ARM was a minnow (turnover £27m - around $45m - in 1997) compared to Intel (1997 turnover $25bn). Intel couldn't compete directly with ARM by licensing its designs to third parties, but they might represent formidable competition for other firms considering adopting ARM’s own, less powerful, processor designs. </p><p>By the late 1990s, there was a growing interest in using those designs in cellphones following Nokia’s use of an ARM-based Texas Instruments SoC in one of their most successful handsets.

CPUs. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XScale" rel="">Wikipedia</a><span> has a good summary of what Wireless MMX added to the XScale architecture.</span></p><blockquote><p>Wireless MMX (code-named Concan; "iwMMXt"): 43 new SIMD instructions containing the full MMX instruction set and the integer instructions from Intel's SSE instruction set along with some instructions unique to the XScale. Wireless MMX provides 16 extra 64-bit registers that can be treated as an array of two 32-bit words, four 16-bit halfwords or eight 8-bit bytes. The XScale core can then perform up to eight adds or four MACs in parallel in a single cycle. This capability is used to boost speed in decoding and encoding of multimedia and in playing games.</p></blockquote><p>Formally, the Wireless MMX instructions were implemented as an ARM architecture-compliant co-processor. However, whatever the technical and legal status of this addition to the architecture it sowed confusion and concern:</p><blockquote><p>Intel Corp.'s move this week to deploy new, multimedia instructions in its RISC chip architecture is being seen as its latest effort to distance itself from its processor partner, UK-based ARM Holdings plc, according to analysts. The announcement … also raised some questions–if not confusion–over compatibility issues between the respective RISC chips from Intel and from other ARM licensees.</p><p><span>EETimes: </span><a href="https://www.eetimes.com/intel-distances-itself-from-arm-with-wireless-mmx/" rel="">Intel distances itself from ARM with Wireless MMX</a></p></blockquote><p><span>Intel’s intentions looked like a classic embrace, extend, and extinguish strategy. If a customer chose XScale and used Wireless MMX they would be locked into Intel. It threatened parts of the ARM ecosystem and prompted a response from ARM.

It's probable that some of the OEMs in the mobile market also saw Intel's Wireless MMX as a threat to their purchasing flexibility. </span><strong>The mobile market was not the PC market - Intel was not going to dominate that easily.</strong></p></blockquote><p><span>Wireless MMX didn’t just sow suspicion, it was also a questionable choice for the mobile phone market where including a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) would have been a better decision. Quoting </span><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2006/06/28/intel_mobile_failure/" rel="">The Register</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>A series of poor management decisions ensured that StrongARM was well positioned for a market that was on the decline [PDAs] and rarely competitive in a market that boomed [mobile phones]. </span><strong>Early on, Intel decided against integrating dedicated digital signal processing into the StrongARM chip, later renamed XScale.</strong><span> While this decision was justifiable for fixed embedded markets and for PDAs, it put the chip at a huge disadvantage for lower-cost devices that needed voice capabilities.</span></p></blockquote><p>By 2004 though, Intel had corrected this mistake, with the PXA800F cellular processor which included an Intel MicroSignal Architecture DSP.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

The company had bet heavily on Itanium, a new Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) architecture, as the successor to x86 designs on servers and high-end desktops. Itanium turned out to be a disaster. While Intel was distracted, AMD developed a 64-bit version of x86 that gave customers better performance and backward compatibility.  By the middle of 2005, AMD was </span><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/amd-once-again-hits-the-roaring-20s-1/" rel="">rapidly gaining ground</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>AMD now accounts for 21.4 percent of all desktop, notebook and server processors using the x86 instruction set that were shipped during the fourth quarter, Mercury Research plans to announce next week. The chipmaker's share grew from 17.7 percent in the third quarter, on strong gains in all three of those segments.</p></blockquote><p><em>Intel’s lunch was being eaten in real-time.</em></p><p>Decisive action was needed when Paul Otellini took over as Intel CEO from Craig Barrett in May 2005. </p><p><span>The choice of Otellini as CEO was controversial for some, largely because he was the first Intel CEO not to have a technical background. A Fortune magazine </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2005/04/18/is-this-the-right-man-for-intel/" rel="">article</a><span> published in April 2005 asked ‘Is Paul Otellini The Right Man for Intel?’ </span></p><p>Andy Grove had no doubts:</p><blockquote><p>Andy Grove, the great ex-CEO of Intel, is talking about Paul Otellini, his onetime aide who is set to become the chip pioneer’s fifth chief executive on May 18. And Grove is annoyed. “Bullshit!” he says. Parroting a remark I’ve heard repeatedly interviewing people about the new boss, I’ve just asked if it matters that Otellini is not a technologist. Current and former Intel insiders, Wall Street and industry analysts, competitors, and customers–they all make the same obvious point about Otellini, whose background is in finance and marketing.</p><p>Grove retorts it is “superficial” to focus on Otellini’s lack of an engineering degree. “Paul is a self-taught technologist. He knows the products better than I ever did,” Grove says.</p></blockquote><p>Let’s deal with one myth about Otellini straight away. He was not just a ‘numbers guy’. He started his career in Intel’s finance department but, by the time of his appointment as CEO, he had already had extended periods successfully running Intel’s microprocessor division, groupwide sales and marketing, and then the Intel Architecture Group.</p><p>This Fortune article makes it clear what others thought Otellini needed to do:</p><blockquote><p>Atik Raza, former president of AMD and now a venture capitalist, thinks Otellini has the skills to refocus the company. “Intel’s meanderings will reduce under Paul,” he says. “You will see a sense of purpose once he has totally taken control.”</p></blockquote><p><span>How Otellini intended to apply that sense of purpose was soon clear. In April 2006 a broad </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna12516970" rel="">restructuring</a><span> of Intel was set in motion:</span></p><blockquote><p>“No stone will remain unturned or unlooked at,” Otellini said at an analyst conference in New York City. “You will see a leaner, more agile and more efficient Intel Corp.”</p></blockquote><p>And the '“meanderings” would come under particular focus:</p><blockquote><p>Over the next 90 days, executives will identify underperforming business groups and cost inefficiencies but will not wait until the end of the review to start implementing changes, Otellini said.</p></blockquote><p><span>In September 2006 the </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna14679917" rel="">results of this review</a><span> were made public:</span></p><blockquote><p>Intel said after the market closed that it will eliminate 10,500 jobs — about 10 percent of its work force — through layoffs, attrition and the sale of underperforming business groups as part of a massive restructuring.</p></blockquote><p>The refocusing was not just about cutting jobs and business units. There would be a new focus on what Intel’s customers wanted:</p><blockquote><p>No longer should it focus on processor speed for speed’s sake alone. Instead it should listen to what customers want–the way a marketer, not an engineer, would approach designing products. “People still want performance, but they want other things, and we need to deliver and discuss performance in a different way,” says Otellini. Now that he is becoming boss, Intel engineering is all about catering to customers. Call it the Otellini amendment to Moore’s law: “This is the first time in Intel’s history where the product orientation of Intel is outward-facing,” he says.</p></blockquote><p>And what they wanted was low power and wireless:</p><blockquote><p>… he successfully fought with engineers over the need to create Centrino, Intel’s wireless brand. In typical Intel tradition, the engineers were bent on designing a faster, more powerful processor. Otellini was convinced that users of laptops already had plenty of power and speed–what they cared about was heat generation, battery life, and wireless capabilities. He won, and Centrino paid off. Not only has it been a giant success, but it is now the model for the way Otellini is reshaping all of Intel’s businesses.</p></blockquote><p>Listening to customers and refocusing on power consumption led to one of the early successes of Otellini’s tenure. Apple had been using IBM PowerPC processors in its Mac desktops and laptops but the latter were struggling due to PowerPC’s excessive power consumption. Otellini persuaded Steve Jobs to switch to the new Intel designs using Intel’s newest, lower-power, Core architecture.</p><p>The importance the usually reserved Otellini, with his marketing background, placed in capturing such a high-profile customer for Intel’s chips is clear from his willingness to appear in a ‘bunny suit’ on stage with Steve Jobs at the launch of the Intel Macs.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/cp49Tmmtmf8?feature=shared" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe299ff22-4920-4bc5-a1f7-a2f4cae89f0a_2606x1466.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe299ff22-4920-4bc5-a1f7-a2f4cae89f0a_2606x1466.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe299ff22-4920-4bc5-a1f7-a2f4cae89f0a_2606x1466.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe299ff22-4920-4bc5-a1f7-a2f4cae89f0a_2606x1466.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe299ff22-4920-4bc5-a1f7-a2f4cae89f0a_2606x1466.jpeg" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e299ff22-4920-4bc5-a1f7-a2f4cae89f0a_2606x1466.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:134487,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://youtu.be/cp49Tmmtmf8?feature=shared&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe299ff22-4920-4bc5-a1f7-a2f4cae89f0a_2606x1466.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe299ff22-4920-4bc5-a1f7-a2f4cae89f0a_2606x1466.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe299ff22-4920-4bc5-a1f7-a2f4cae89f0a_2606x1466.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe299ff22-4920-4bc5-a1f7-a2f4cae89f0a_2606x1466.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Paul Otellini  in a ‘bunny suit’ presents Steve Jobs with a wafer of Intel CPUs for the first Intel Macs - Source </span><a href="https://youtu.be/cp49Tmmtmf8?feature=shared" rel="">YouTube</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Otellini’s enthusiasm for low power and wireless connectivity didn’t extend to the struggling, money-losing XScale business, where the much-needed patience was in short supply. </p><p>Already by the start of 2005, there was speculation about the future of XScale and Intel’s commitment to the phone business:</p><blockquote><p>Progress has been so slow that rumors circulate periodically that Intel will get out of cellphone chips altogether.</p></blockquote><p>Which prompted a vigorous response: </p><blockquote><p>“No way… We’re not getting out of cellphones”</p></blockquote><p>However, a commitment to phone chips wasn’t a commitment to XScale phone chips.</p><p>In the middle of 2006 as part of Otellini’s restructuring, and just before the launch of the iPhone, Intel sold XScale’s PXA mobile SoC business to Marvell for a modest $600m, roughly what it had paid for the StrongARM business almost a decade previously. Intel had 1,400 engineers working on XScale, and the company confirmed that many of these, presumably including those with the most experience in mobile SoCs, were expected to join Marvell.</p><p><span>Why did Intel sell XScale? Part of the answer comes from some of the lessons that Intel and Otellini had learned in the previous decade which in part were a return to Grove-era thinking. Intel had succeeded under Grove when it focused on x86, an architecture with enormous software support - on the desktop at least - and a cozy duopoly with AMD. It struggled when it tried an innovative new architecture like Itanium or an architecture with lots of competitors like ARM. Otellini’s first job working for Grove had been to analyze one of Intel’s failed architectural adventures, the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BiiN" rel="">BiiN </a><span>project which in turn had emerged from the failed iAPX432 project:</span></p><blockquote><p>His first assignment was to write a postmortem for the board on a failed joint venture with Siemens. Insiders joked that the project, called BiiN, stood for “billions invested in nothing,”</p></blockquote><p><em><strong>Ouch! Otellini would ensure that Intel’s focus would be on x86 with no ‘meanderings’.</strong></em></p><p>The fact that the XScale business was struggling would have reinforced Otellini’s view that ARM-based devices were not the answer.</p><p><span>Almost a year earlier, soon after becoming CEO, Otellini </span><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2005/08/23/intel_ppw_plan/" rel="">had laid out a vision</a><span> for low-power portable computing (my emphasis):</span></p><blockquote><p>Otellini's pitch was a new generation of devices he dubbed the 'handtop'. The platform is nothing new, of course - PDAs, palmtops and handheld PCs have been around for years - but past attempts to create truly mobile, wireless micro PCs have been hindered by performance and battery life limitations.</p><p><strong>Otellini said Intel's new focus on "performance per watt" will remove those limits. The vision is a 0.5W processor with sufficient horsepower to run Windows Vista by 2010.</strong></p></blockquote><p><span>If Otellini’s ‘handtop’ SoC ran Windows Vista - with access to the rich ecosystem of Windows software - then it would need to use the x86 instruction set. The powerful </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintel" rel="">Wintel</a><span> relationship with Microsoft that had dominated the desktop would be recreated in a new series of portable devices.</span></p><p>Plus Intel believed it had a potential cellphone winner in its WiMAX wireless technology. In the 2005 Fortune article on Otellini, Sean Maloney, head of Intel’s new Mobility business made the approach clear:</p><blockquote><p>“It’s a strategic thing for the company. We’re on the attack, not the defensive.” What Maloney has in mind for conquering cellphones is an end-around strategy. It’s called WiMAX, a radio technology being developed by an Intel-led consortium of manufacturers. WiMAX aims to make possible wireless broadband communications for up to a 50-mile radius in much the same way Wi-Fi works at up to 150 feet or so. That could change the game in mobile communications by making today’s cellphones obsolete.</p></blockquote><p>Let’s try to build a picture of Intel’s bid for, or at least discussions with Apple about, the SoC for the first iPhone, probably taking place sometime in 2005. </p><p>Walter Isaacson’s biography of Steve Jobs describes the relationship between the two companies, and their CEOs, around that time. Intel was bidding to replace the PowerPC CPUs in the Mac:</p><blockquote><p>Most of the negotiating was done, as Jobs preferred, on long walks, sometimes on the trails up to the radio telescope known as the Dish above the Stanford campus. Jobs would start the walk by telling a story and explaining how he saw the history of computers evolving. By the end he would be haggling over price.</p></blockquote><p>The two companies reached an agreement about CPUs for the Mac and with Apple as a customer Intel seemingly had a golden opportunity to get its designs into the iPhone. Intel still had the XScale ARM business and was developing high-performance SoCs for the mobile market. However, dig a little deeper and the position seems much less rosy.</p><p>We may never know what transpired in the discussions between the two CEOs, neither of whom, sadly, are still with us, on the iPhone SoC. We have strong clues though, and can perhaps perform some informed deduction based on these clues.</p><p><em><strong>First, Apple and Jobs were highly secretive and would have been especially so about a project of such extreme confidentiality as the iPhone.</strong></em><span> </span></p><p>Jobs would later make it clear to Isaacson that he was sensitive about sharing information with Intel in particular:</p><blockquote><p>… we just didn't want to teach them everything, which they could go and sell to our competitors.</p></blockquote><p><span>Jobs famously </span><a href="https://allthingsd.com/20081015/apple-a-ship-that-leaks-from-the-top/" rel="">quipped</a><span> about senior executives sharing sensitive data in an earlier regime at Apple:</span></p><blockquote><p>“There used to be saying at Apple,” Jobs recalled at our D5 conference: “Isn’t it funny? A ship that leaks from the top.”</p></blockquote><p><em>Is it likely that Jobs would ‘leak from the top’ about the iPhone to Intel?</em></p><p>Given all this, it’s possible that Jobs didn’t tell Otellini that Apple was developing a phone, and it’s impossible to conceive of him sharing precise details of the first iPhone. Instead, it’s likely that at most Jobs specified the outline of the application processor design that Apple needed: its performance, power consumption, price, and so on. It might have been presented as the opportunity to bid for the chip for the next version of the iPod. We’ll see in a moment that this probably didn’t seem like the specification for a chip for an innovative high-end phone and it probably wasn’t obvious to Otellini what the chip was for.</p><p><em>If so then it’s questionable to say Intel ‘passed on the first iPhone’ if it didn’t even know what product the SoC was for.</em></p><p><em><strong>Second, Intel didn’t have the right product for Apple.</strong></em></p><p>By the start of 2005, Otellini was already thinking about x86-based smartphone chips, and as we’ve seen, Intel’s commitment to XScale was in doubt publicly and Otellini had probably made his mind up to sell. I suspect he was reluctant to push a design from a business that he expected Intel would soon be disposing of. At that time though, no Intel x86 design was remotely suitable for a device like the iPhone, as the power consumption of all of Intel’s x86 designs was far too high. </p><p><em>Caught between XScale and x86 the timing could not have been worse.</em></p><p>Let’s also switch this around and look at the decision from Apple’s perspective. Apple’s engineers knew what products Intel had in their XScale phone SoC business. If they believed that Intel had a competitive or superior product then it seems likely that engagement would have progressed further than it did. Apple would also have known that Intel’s commitment to XScale was in doubt.</p><p><em><strong>Third, although the transition to Intel on the Mac was, in many respects, a triumph in engineering and project management, it was not unblemished.</strong></em><span> </span></p><p>Apple had to create a 32-bit version of the OSX operating system for Intel’s x86 architecture before quickly phasing it out because Intel was late releasing its 64-bit Core 2 architecture designs.</p><p>The strains between the two companies came to the surface in Jobs’s interviews with Walter Isaacson, where Jobs comments:</p><blockquote><p>They're like a steamship, not very flexible.

Apple used a relatively modest design from Samsung, the latest version of a series used in the iPod:</p><blockquote><p><span>The S5L8900 contains a 32-bit ARMv6 compatible </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM11" rel="">ARM 1176JZF-S</a><span> CPU core [one of the ARM cores whose development had, in part, been prompted by the emergence of StrongARM] and is manufactured in the 90 nm CMOS process. The default clock rate of the CPU core is normally 666.6 MHz, but has been lowered by Apple to about 412 MHz, and the bus frequency is about 103 MHz. … As SoC, S5L8900 also has an integrated GPU, a PowerVR MBX LITE clocked at 60 MHz.</span></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_iPhone_systems-on-chip" rel="">Wikipedia</a></p></blockquote><p>Talking about powerful SoCs has been a feature of Apple’s recent iPhone and Mac launches. Discussion of the SoC is notably absent from the first iPhone Keynote. The performance of the SoC just wasn’t a selling point for the new phone.</p><p>While Intel had been developing ever more powerful versions of XScale with clock speeds aiming at over a gigahertz, the iPhone materially reduced the clock speed of its SoC from its default to improve battery life. Apple had squeezed every bit of performance - and squeezed the operating system that would become known as iOS - out of the modestly specified SoC it had sourced from Samsung.</p><p><span>As an aside, Intel did make one chip that appeared in the original iPhone, as can be seen in the </span><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+1st+Generation+Teardown/599" rel="">iFixit teardown photos</a><span>, where the chip with the distinctive ‘i’ symbol is tentatively identified as ‘an Intel Wireless Flash stacked 32 Mb NOR + 16 Mb SRAM chip.’ Intel could compete on price in highly price-sensitive markets!</span></p><p><em><strong>Even if the opportunity to build the SoC for the first iPhone had passed, perhaps all was not lost for Intel.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Last night Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, quitely announced the next step in the integration of Threads into the Fediverse.
In addition to being able to follow Threads accounts from Fediverse/Mastodon accounts, we can now reply to and like Threads posts. Threads are taking a quiet, incremental approach to Federation, but seem genuinely commited.</p><p>Why is this important?</p><p>Because I believe that Meta as a whole is moving to an open systems approach, not because Mark Zuckerberg is a nice guy, but because he is smart enough to go open before he is forced to by regulators, (or broken up).</p><p>The reaction to the announcement on Threads was a huge shower of ‘What is the Fediverse?’.

Tumblr announced a move to the Fediverse over a year ago, but didn’t make good on it.
Now they are changing platforms they’ll get Federation for free.</p><p>Standby for half a billion Tumblr blogs to turn up on the Fediverse.
This also means Threads users liking Tumblr posts and probably reviving a struggling platform. The true power of open social media is about to become apparent.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="quarto-document-content">





<p><strong>TL; DR</strong>: we are deprecating the <code>pandas</code> and <code>dask</code> backends and will be removing them in version 10.0.</p>
<p>There is no feature gap between the <code>pandas</code> backend and our default DuckDB backend, and DuckDB is <em>much</em> more performant. <code>pandas</code> DataFrames will still be available as <em>format</em> for getting data to and from Ibis, we just won’t support using <code>pandas</code> to execute queries.</p>
<p>Most of the rationale below applies to the Dask backend since it has so much in common with pandas. Dask is a great project and people should continue to use it outside the Ibis context.</p>
<section id="why-pandas-and-a-bit-of-ibis-history">
<h2 data-anchor-id="why-pandas-and-a-bit-of-ibis-history">Why <code>pandas</code>? And a bit of Ibis history</h2>
<p>Way back in the early days of Ibis, there was only one backend: Impala. Not everyone used Impala (mindblowing, we know), and so it wasn’t too long until the Postgres backend was added (by the inimitable Phillip Cloud).</p>
<p>These two backends were both featureful, but there was a big problem with adoption: Want to try out Ibis? You need to install Impala or Postgres first.</p>
<p>Not an insurmountable problem, but a LOT more work than “just <code>pip install &lt;newthing&gt;</code>” – which prompted the question, how can a prospective Ibis user take the API for a spin without requiring a DBA or extra infrastructure beyond a laptop?</p>
<p>The obvious answer (at the time) was to use the only in-memory DataFrame engine around and wire up a <code>pandas</code> backend.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-agony-and-the-agony">
<h2 data-anchor-id="the-agony-and-the-agony">The agony and the agony</h2>
<p><code>pandas</code> was the best option at the time, and it allowed new users to try out Ibis. But, it never fit well into the model of data analysis that Ibis strives for. The <code>pandas</code> backend has more specialized code than any other backend, because it is so fundamentally different than all the other systems Ibis works with.</p>
<section id="deferred-vs-eager">
<h3 data-anchor-id="deferred-vs-eager">Deferred vs Eager</h3>
<p><code>pandas</code> is inherently an eager engine – every time you hit Enter you are computing an intermediate result. Ibis uses a deferred execution model, similar to what nearly all SQL backends use, that enables query planning and optimization passes.</p>
<p>Trying to make a <code>pandas</code> interface that behaves in a deferred way is hard.</p>
<p>One of the unfortunate effects of this mismatch is that, unlike our other backends, the <code>pandas</code> backend is often <em>much</em> slower than just using <code>pandas</code> directly.</p>
<p>And to provide this suboptimal experience, we have a few thousand lines of code that are only used in the <code>pandas</code> backend.</p>
</section>
<section id="nan-vs-null">
<h3 data-anchor-id="nan-vs-null"><code>NaN</code> vs <code>NULL</code></h3>
<p>The choice was made a long time ago to accept using <code>NaN</code> as the marker for missing values in <code>pandas</code>. This is because NumPy has a notion of <code>NaN</code>, but a Python <code>None</code> would lead to an <code>object</code>-dtype and poor performance.</p>
<p>Practicality beats purity, but this is a horrible decision to have to make. Ibis <em>doesn’t</em> have to make it with any other backend, because NULL indicates a missing value, and NaN is Not a Number.</p>
<p>Those are fundamentally different ideas and it is an ongoing headache for Ibis to try to pretend that they aren’t.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-types">
<h3 data-anchor-id="data-types">Data types</h3>
<p>The new Arrow-backed types in <code>pandas</code> are a great improvement and we’ll leave it at that.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="misleading-new-users">
<h2 data-anchor-id="misleading-new-users">Misleading new users</h2>
<p>People reach for what is familiar. When you try Ibis for the first time, we’re asking you to both a) try Ibis and b) pick a backend. We have defaults to try to help with this, but it can be confusing at first.</p>
<p>We have many reports from new users that “Ibis is slow”. What this almost always means is that they tried the <code>pandas</code> backend (because they know <code>pandas</code>) and they are having a less-than-great time.</p>
<p>If they tried DuckDB or Polars, instead, they would have a much easier time getting things going.</p>
</section>
<section id="feature-parity">
<h2 data-anchor-id="feature-parity">Feature parity</h2>
<p>This is the one of the strongest reasons to drop the <code>pandas</code> backend – it is redundant. The DuckDB backend can seamlessly query pandas DataFrames, supports several flavors of UDF, and can read and write parquet, CSV, JSON, and other formats.</p>
<p>There is a reason DuckDB is our default backend: it’s easy to install, it runs locally, it’s blazing fast, and it interacts well with the Python ecosystem. Those are all the reasons we added <code>pandas</code> as a backend in the first place, but with the added benefit of blazing-fast results, and no type-system headaches.</p>

<p>Why do we <a href="https://kde.org/donate/">ask for donations</a> so often? Because it’s important! As KDE becomes more successful and an increasing number of people use our software, our costs grow as well:</p>



<ul>
<li>Web and server hosting</li>



<li>Organizing and hosting larger Akademy events</li>



<li>Funding more and larger sprints</li>



<li>Paying people to work on stuff the volunteer community doesn’t focus on, and retaining them over time</li>
</ul>



<p>And so on. If we don’t raise more money while our software becomes more popular, we risk “dying of success,” so to speak. Remember, we give all this stuff away for free, no strings attached! Nobody has to pay a cent if they don’t want to or can’t afford to.</p>



<p>Accordingly, if you’re plugged into KDE social media, you probably see a lot of requests for <a href="https://kde.org/donate/">donations</a>. I end every one of my “This Week in KDE” posts with one, and many others do for <a href="https://planet.kde.org/">their own blog posts</a> as well. KDE’s official social media channels blast it out constantly, and we also do yearly fundraisers that are widely promoted online. If you’re reading this, you may get the impression that we’re always begging for cash!</p>



<p>But if you’re <em>not</em> plugged into these communications channels, you might not have ever seen a donation request at all. We know that the fraction of people who subscribe to these channels is small, so there’s a <em>huge</em> number of people who may not even know they <em>can</em> donate to KDE, let alone that donations are critically important to its continued existence.</p>



<p>Starting in Plasma 6.2, that changes, and I’d like to introduce what it will look like! From 6.2 onwards, Plasma itself will <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/4490">show a system notification asking for a donation</a> once per year, in December:</p>

<p>The idea here is to get the message that KDE really does need your financial help in front of more eyeballs — especially eyeballs not currently looking at KDE’s public-facing promotion efforts.</p>



<hr>



<p>Now, I know that messages like this can be controversial! The change was carefully considered, and we tried our best to minimize the annoying-ness factor: It’s small and unobtrusive, and no matter what you do with it (click any button, close it, etc) it’ll go away until next year. It’s implemented as a KDE Daemon (KDED) module, which allows users and distributors to permanently disable it if they like. You can also disable just the popup on System Settings’ Notifications page, accessible from the configure button in the notification’s header.</p>



<p>Ultimately the decision to do this came down to the following factors:</p>



<ol>
<li>We looked at FOSS peers like Thunderbird and Wikipedia which have similar things (and in Wikipedia’s case, the message is vastly more intrusive and naggy). In both cases, it didn’t drive everyone away and instead instead resulted in a massive increase in donations that the projects have been able to use to employ lots of people.</li>



<li>KDE really needs something like this to help our finances grow sustainably in line with our userbase and adoption by vendors and distributors.</li>
</ol>



<p>So now let me address what I anticipate will be some common concerns:</p>



<h2>I think you’re wrong; people hate pop-ups and this is going to turn them off!</h2>



<p>Like I said, peer organizations didn’t see that happen, and some were even more in-your-face about it. I do suspect a small but vocal crowd of people will spread doom and gloom about it on social media anyway, of course. This also happened when we implemented off-by-default telemetry — which by the way, <a href="https://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/metrics-in-kde-are-they-useful/">was implemented so conservatively that it barely collects any information of value at all</a>. It’s a cautionary tale about the danger of being too timid and ending up with the worst of both worlds.</p>



<p>The worst-case scenario is that we don’t get more donations from this after a couple of years, and end up removing it. That’s always an option. But I think it’s worth venturing out there and being a bit bold! With risk comes opportunity.</p>



<h2>KDE shouldn’t need to pay people directly; employment should come from vendors and distributors shipping our software!</h2>



<p>To a certain extent this already does happen: by far the largest contributor of paid work is Blue Systems — mostly funded by Valve Corporation, which ships KDE software on the Steam Deck. There are also trickles and spurts of sponsored work from distros, KDAB, and enterprising folks who get funded via grants.</p>



<p>Ultimately a healthy economic ecosystem around KDE includes people employed by many parties, including KDE itself, in my opinion. This is how KDE can help control its own destiny. And that costs money! Money that needs to come from somewhere.</p>



<h2>Why does it have to be a notification pop-up? Put this in Welcome Center or something!</h2>



<p>We had a request for donations in Welcome center for several years, and it didn’t make a difference, because right after you’ve installed the system wasn’t the right time to ask. At that point, you don’t know if you like Plasma yet, so asking for money is premature.</p>



<h2>If KDE is as successful as Thunderbird and Wikipedia have been, what are you going to do with all that money?</h2>



<p>This is a question the KDE e.V. board of directors as a whole would need to answer, and any decision on it will be made collectively.</p>



<p>But as one of the five members on that board, I can tell you my personal answer and the one that as your representative, I’d advocate for. It’s basically the platform I ran on two years ago: extend an offer of full-time employment to our current people, and hire even more! I want us to end up with paid QA people and distro developers, and even more software engineers. I want us to fund the creation of a next-generation KDE OS we can offer directly to institutions looking to switch to Linux, and a hardware certification program to go along with it. I want us to to extend our promotional activities and outreach to other major distros and vendors and pitch our software to them directly. I want to see Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop ship Plasma by default. I want us to use this money to take over the world — with freedom, empowerment, and kindness.</p>



<p>These have been dreams for a long time, and throughout KDE we’ve been slowly moving towards them over the years. With a lot more money, we can turbocharge the pace! If that stuff sounds good, you can <a href="https://kde.org/donate/">start with a donation today</a>. 🙂 </p>



<hr>



<p>I know talking about money can be awkward. But failure to plan is planning to fail; money is something we can’t ignore and just hope things work out — and we don’t. Raising more money is a part of that plan, and this new yearly donation notification is a part of raising money. It’s my expectation and hope that asking our users for donations will result in more donations, and that we can use these to accelerate KDE’s reach and the quality of our software!</p>

<p>Usually, I would just powerthrough reading the minimized code to understand the implementation (or look for a <code>.map</code> file to restore the original code). However, I realized that I never tried asking ChatGPT to do it for me... So I copied all of the above code and asked ChatGPT to "explain the code". Here is the response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The provided code is quite complex, but I'll break it down into a more understandable format, explaining its different parts and their functionalities.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The code defines several functions and components using JavaScript, specifically in the context of a React application. It deals with generating some dynamic text content, presumably ASCII art or some kind of visual effect using characters from a predefined set. Additionally, it includes utility functions for event handling, performance timing, and HTML content conversion.</p>
<h3>Key Components and Functions</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Character Set Selection:</strong>
<pre><code>const { floor: ra, abs: KE, min: QE } = Math;
const O5 = ["reactive.network REACTIVE.NETWORK", "$@B%8&amp;WM#*oahkbdpqwmZO0QLCJUYXzcvunxrjft/|()1{}[]?-_+~&lt;&gt;i!lI;:,^`'. .:â–‘â–’â–“â–ˆ"];
const G7 = Date.now() % 3 ? O5[1] : O5[0];
const V5 = G7.length;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>This part of the code imports some common Math functions (<code>floor</code>, <code>abs</code>, and <code>min</code>) and defines two sets of characters, stored in <code>O5</code>.</li>
<li>Based on the current time (<code>Date.now() % 3</code>), it selects one of these sets (<code>G7</code>) to use later.</li>
<li>The length of the selected character set is stored in <code>V5</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Character Selection Function:</strong>
<pre><code>function eT(e, t, n, r) {
    const i = t.time * 8e-5;
    const s = QE(t.cols, t.rows);
    const o = t.metrics.aspect * 0.2;
    const l = { x: ((4 * (e.x - t.cols / 6.25)) / s) * o, y: (5 * (e.y - t.rows / 4)) / s };
    const u = ra(KE(YE(l) - i) * V5 + (ra(e.x / 1) % 2) * 2) % V5;
    return G7[u];
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The <code>eT</code> function generates a character based on the input position (<code>e.x</code>, <code>e.y</code>) and the current time (<code>t.time</code>).</li>
<li>It adjusts the position using some aspect ratio calculations and selects a character from <code>G7</code> based on a combination of the position and time.</li>
<li>The purpose of <code>YE</code> function isn't directly clear from the code, but it seems to be a custom function used in this calculation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>React Component (<code>tT</code>) for Displaying Dynamic Content:</strong>
<pre><code>const tT = () =&gt; {
    const e = j.useRef(null);
    const [t, n] = j.useState({ height: null, width: null });
    j.useEffect(() =&gt; {
        function r() {
            n({ height: window.innerHeight, width: window.innerWidth });
        }
        if (typeof window &lt; "u") {
            n({ height: window.innerHeight, width: window.innerWidth });
            window.addEventListener("resize", r);
            return () =&gt; window.removeEventListener("resize", r);
        }
    }, []);

    j.useEffect(() =&gt; {
        const r = e.current;
        if (!r) return;
        const i = 12;
        const s = ra(t.width / i) * 1.6;
        const o = ra(t.height / i);
        const l = { aspect: s / o };
        const u = setInterval(() =&gt; {
            let c = "";
            for (let d = 0; d &lt; o; d++) {
                for (let f = 0; f &lt; s; f++) c += eT({ x: f, y: d }, { cols: s, rows: o, metrics: l, time: Date.now() });
                c += `
`;
            }
            r.textContent = c;
        }, 1e3 / JE.fps);
        return () =&gt; clearInterval(u);
    }, [t]);

    return a.jsx("div", { style: { position: "absolute", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%" }, children: a.jsx("div", { ref: e, style: { width: "100%", height: "100%", whiteSpace: "pre", overflow: "hidden" } }) });
};
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>This is a React component that sets up an interval to periodically update the content of a <code>div</code> element (<code>e.current</code>) with dynamically generated characters.</li>
<li>It calculates the number of columns (<code>s</code>) and rows (<code>o</code>) based on the window size and then fills the <code>div</code> with characters generated by the <code>eT</code> function.</li>
<li>The effect runs at a specified frames per second (<code>JE.fps</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

</code></pre>
<p>To my surprise, the response is not only good enough, but it is also very readable.</p>
<p>Here is the above component in action:</p>
<!-- -->

<p>Comparing the outputs, <del>it looks like LLM response overlooked a few implementation details</del>, but it is still a good enough implementation to learn from. Definitely a neat use case I've not considered before!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update (2024-08-29): Initially, I thought that the LLM didn't replicate the logic accurately because the output was missing a few characters visible in the original component (e.g., <code>░▒▓█</code>). However, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41389791">a user on HN forum</a> pointed out that it was likely a copy-paste error.</p>
<p>Upon further investigation, I discovered that the original code contains different characters than what I pasted into ChatGPT. This appears to be an encoding issue, as I was able to get the correct characters after downloading the script. After updating the code to use the correct characters, the output is now identical to the original component.</p>
<p>I apologize, GPT-4, for mistakenly accusing you of making mistakes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>A drug used to treat type 2 diabetes is associated with a 35% lower risk of dementia, according to <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2024-079475" data-link-name="in body link">research</a>.</p><p>The number of people with dementia globally is expected to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/06/number-adults-with-dementia-exceed-150-million-2050-study" data-link-name="in body link">nearly triple to 153 million by 2050</a>. The health and social costs linked to dementia <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/31/almost-half-of-dementia-cases-could-be-prevented-or-delayed-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link">already exceed $1tn (£780bn) a year</a>, research shows.</p><p>Type 2 diabetes is one of 14 risk factors associated with a greater risk of developing dementia. Other factors are high levels of bad cholesterol, untreated vision loss, hearing impairment, high blood pressure, smoking, obesity and physical inactivity.</p><p>Now a large Korean study published in the BMJ has suggested that a medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes, called sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, may lower the risk of dementia.</p><p>While previous studies have suggested SGLT-2 inhibitors could have a protective effect against dementia for older patients, until now, any protective effect on younger people and specific types of dementia such as Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia has been unclear.</p><p>The academics analysed data from more than 220,000 type 2 diabetics aged between 40 and 69 on the Korea national health insurance service who did not already have dementia.</p><p>Half were taking SGLT-2 inhibitors, which reduce the amount of glucose the kidneys reabsorb, and half were taking another drug called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, which block the enzyme that helps increase insulin levels after food.</p><p>A total of 1,172 participants newly diagnosed with dementia were identified during the study period.</p><p>The researchers calculated SGLT-2 inhibitors were associated with a 35% lower risk of dementia compared with DPP-4 inhibitors. They also identified a 39% reduced risk for Alzheimer’s disease and a 52% reduced risk for vascular dementia associated with patients taking SGLT-2 inhibitors.</p><p>The authors cautioned that this is an observational study and so could not prove cause and effect, but concluded that repurposing existing drugs to treat diseases that cause dementia “is one that has huge potential”, although further trials were needed to confirm their findings.</p><p>Dr Jacqui Hanley, the head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said the data was “promising”, adding: “People affected by dementia urgently need effective treatments, as last week’s news of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/aug/22/uk-health-regulator-rejects-lecanemab-as-treatment-for-alzheimers" data-link-name="in body link">Alzheimer’s drug lecanemab’s rejection by Nice</a> emphasised.”</p><p>Repurposing medication that has already been licensed for treating dementia could speed up the process of testing them in clinical trials, as well as making it significantly cheaper, she said. “If we are to cure dementia, clinicians will need a toolkit of treatments which tackle different aspects of the disease and can be used in combination. Research into repurposing drugs may help us do just that.”</p><p>But Prof William Whiteley, the associate director of the British Heart Foundation data science centre, said: “If this study were true, then SGLT-2 inhibitors would almost halve the risk of some types of dementia, which is much larger than the effect of medicines to reduce dementia progression, or medicines to prevent heart attack and stroke.</p><p>“Instead, a quirk of the study design has probably given this result.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Nearly a century ago, the physicist Erwin Schrödinger called attention to a quirk of the quantum world that has fascinated and vexed researchers ever since. When quantum particles such as atoms interact, they shed their individual identities in favor of a collective state that’s greater, and weirder, than the sum of its parts. This phenomenon is called entanglement.</p>
<p>Researchers have a firm understanding of how entanglement works in idealized systems containing just a few particles. But the real world is more complicated. In large arrays of atoms, like the ones that make up the stuff we see and touch, the laws of quantum physics compete with the laws of thermodynamics, and things get messy.</p>
<p>At very low temperatures, entanglement can spread over long distances, enveloping many atoms and giving rise to strange phenomena such as <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/superconductivity/">superconductivity</a>. Crank up the heat, though, and atoms jitter about, disrupting the fragile links that bind entangled particles.</p>
<p>Physicists have long struggled to pin down the details of this process. Now, a team of four researchers has <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16850">proved</a> that entanglement doesn’t just weaken as temperature increases. Rather, in mathematical models of quantum systems such as the arrays of atoms in physical materials, there’s always a specific temperature above which it vanishes completely. “It’s not just that it’s exponentially small,” said <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/moitra/">Ankur Moitra</a> of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the authors of the new result. “It’s zero.”</p>
<p>Researchers had previously observed hints of this behavior and dubbed it the “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08005">sudden death</a>” of entanglement. But their evidence has always been indirect. The new finding, by contrast, has the force of a mathematical proof. It establishes the absence of entanglement in a much more comprehensive and rigorous way.</p>
<p>Curiously, the four researchers behind the new result aren’t even physicists, and they didn’t set out to prove anything about entanglement. They’re computer scientists who stumbled on the proof accidentally while developing a new algorithm.</p>
<p>Regardless of their intent, the results have excited researchers in the area. “It’s a very, very strong statement,” said <a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/soonwon-choi/">Soonwon Choi</a>, a physicist at MIT. “I was very impressed.”</p>
<h2><strong>Finding Equilibrium</strong></h2>
<p>The team made their discovery while exploring the theoretical capabilities of future <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/quantum-computing">quantum computers</a> — machines that will exploit quantum behavior, including entanglement and superposition, to perform certain calculations far faster than the conventional computers we know today.</p>
<p>One of the most promising applications of quantum computing is in the study of quantum physics itself. Let’s say you want to understand the behavior of a quantum system. Researchers need to first develop specific procedures, or algorithms, that quantum computers can use to answer your questions.</p>

<p>But not all questions about quantum systems are easier to answer using quantum algorithms. Some are equally easy for classical algorithms, which run on ordinary computers, while others are hard for both classical and quantum ones.</p>
<p>To understand where quantum algorithms and the computers that can run them might offer an advantage, researchers often analyze mathematical models called spin systems, which capture the basic behavior of arrays of interacting atoms. They then might ask: What will a spin system do when you leave it alone at a given temperature? The state it settles into, called its thermal equilibrium state, determines many of its other properties, so researchers have long sought to develop algorithms for finding equilibrium states.</p>
<p>Whether those algorithms really benefit from being quantum in nature depends on the temperature of the spin system in question. At very high temperatures, known classical algorithms can do the job easily. The problem gets harder as temperature decreases and quantum phenomena grow stronger; in some systems it gets too hard for even quantum computers to solve in any reasonable amount of time. But the details of all this remain murky.</p>

<p>“When do you go to the space where you need quantum, and when do you go to the space where quantum doesn’t even help you?” said <a href="https://ewintang.com/">Ewin Tang</a>, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley and one of the authors of the new result. “Not that much is known.”</p>
<p>In February, Tang and Moitra began thinking about the thermal equilibrium problem together with two other MIT computer scientists: a postdoctoral researcher named <a href="https://www.aineshbakshi.com/">Ainesh Bakshi</a> and Moitra’s graduate student <a href="https://aliu42.github.io/">Allen Liu</a>. In 2023, they’d all collaborated on <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02243">a groundbreaking quantum algorithm</a> for a different task involving spin systems, and they were looking for a new challenge.</p>
<p>“When we work together, things just flow,” Bakshi said. “It’s been awesome.”</p>
<p>Before that 2023 breakthrough, the three MIT researchers had never worked on quantum algorithms. Their background was in learning theory, a subfield of computer science that focuses on algorithms for statistical analysis. But like ambitious upstarts everywhere, they viewed their relative naïveté as an advantage, a way to see a problem with fresh eyes. “One of our strengths is that we don’t know much quantum,” Moitra said. “The only quantum we know is the quantum that Ewin taught us.”</p>
<p>The team decided to focus on relatively high temperatures, where researchers suspected that fast quantum algorithms would exist, even though nobody had been able to prove it. Soon enough, they found a way to adapt an old technique from learning theory into a new fast algorithm. But as they were writing up their paper, another team came out with a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12691">similar result</a>: a proof that a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09207">promising algorithm</a> developed the previous year would work well at high temperatures. They’d been scooped.</p>
<h2><strong>Sudden Death Reborn</strong></h2>
<p>A bit bummed that they’d come in second, Tang and her collaborators began corresponding with <a href="https://www.ift.uam-csic.es/en/one-member/595">Álvaro Alhambra</a>, a physicist at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Madrid and one of the authors of the rival paper. They wanted to work out the differences between the results they’d achieved independently. But when Alhambra read through a preliminary draft of the four researchers’ proof, he was surprised to discover that they’d proved something else in an intermediate step: In any spin system in thermal equilibrium, entanglement vanishes completely above a certain temperature. “I told them, ‘Oh, this is very, very important,’” Alhambra said.</p>
