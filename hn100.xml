<p>Tesla is having a tough year.</p>



<p>Once a world leader in the electric-vehicle market, the company’s sales across the U.S., China, and several European countries fell year on year in February, and its stock price dropped almost 50% from a mid-December peak.</p>


<figure><blockquote><p><span>Tesla needs India more than India needs Tesla.</span></p></blockquote></figure>


<p>The politics of Tesla leader Elon Musk and surging Chinese rivals are both contributing to the sales slump. In Germany, where <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uk-new-car-sales-drop-1-february-industry-data-shows-2025-03-05/">Musk supported</a> the right-wing populist party, Tesla’s sales collapsed 76% last month. In the U.S., following Musk’s support for President Donald Trump, the company saw a 6% decline. In China, where Shenzhen-based <span><mark><a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/byd" aria-label="Click to learn more about BYD.">BYD<span>i</span></a></mark><span><span><a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/byd">BYD</a><svg aria-label="Close" role="button"><use xlink:href="#X"></use></svg></span>BYD Auto is a Chinese carmaker that became the world’s leading EV manufacturer in 2023, competing with Tesla for market share and global attention.<span><a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/byd"><span>READ MORE</span><svg><use xlink:href="#chevron"></use></svg></a></span></span></span> is the biggest-selling EV brand, Tesla’s sales fell 49%.</p>



<p>Tesla, meanwhile, is ramping up its presence in the emerging economies. It is opening its <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/finance/personal-finance/tesla-set-for-india-debut-rents-space-in-mumbai-s-bkc-for-rs-35-lakh-month-125030600127_1.html">maiden stores in India</a> and Saudi Arabia, and setting up an office in South Africa. Entering new markets, however, may not solve Tesla’s woes as it is likely to face tough competition from Chinese carmakers and several <a href="https://energyforgrowth.org/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-african-ev-manufacturing/">homegrown companies</a>, which have dug their heels deep in their countries. Tesla’s steep pricing and limited product options are unlikely to woo buyers in these new markets, according to EV industry experts.</p>



<p>“Tesla needs India more than India needs Tesla,” Ravi Gadepalli, founder of mobility advisory firm Transit Intelligence, told <em>Rest of World. </em>There are several reasons why the world’s third-largest market will be an uphill battle for the company.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Local automobile giant Tata Motors has grabbed over 60% of the Indian market with its popular and economically priced electric cars. China’s BYD and MG Motor also rank among the top five EV sellers in the country. The automakers have rapidly grown in India by <a href="https://restofworld.org/2024/blusmart-india-ev-cab-shortage/">partnering with ride-hailing companies</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Indian automakers, especially Tata, already have a strong foothold in the EV market,” Jayapradeep Vasudevan, chief business officer of Indian electric-motorcycle maker Raptee.HV, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “Moreover, Tata’s diverse EV lineup and future expansion plans across different vehicle segments position them well to handle the competitive pressure from Tesla’s entry.”</p>



<p>While Tesla would have to build its presence from the ground up, Tata already has an established distribution network and customer service capabilities across urban and rural India, which give the company a significant advantage, Vasudevan said.</p>



<p>Musk has been hinting at an India entry <a href="https://qz.com/india/652561/indias-entrepreneurs-are-already-pre-ordering-teslas-model-3-even-though-they-have-no-idea-how-much-itll-cost">since 2016</a>, but that hasn’t materialized as Tesla failed to <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/elon-musks-tesla-hunts-for-land-in-india-manufacturing-plant-maharashtra-leads-report-2682119-2025-02-19">negotiate lower import taxes</a> with the government. This might change soon. Last month, Musk met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington, where they discussed space technology, mobility, and innovation. On March 11, India’s largest telecom companies, Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, <a href="https://restofworld.org/2025/airtel-starlink-india-deal-modi-musk/">announced partnerships</a> with Musk’s satellite company Starlink, which has so far struggled to get a license to operate in the country. Tesla did not reply to a request for comment for this story.</p>


<figure><blockquote><p><span>By comparison, Tesla products look rather staid and stale to Chinese and Asian consumers, who have a penchant for new things.</span></p></blockquote></figure>


<p>Chinese makers have been quick to innovate, with BYD this week unveiling a lineup of vehicles it says can charge&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-byd-unveils-faster-charging-ev-platform-aims-build-over-4000-charging-2025-03-17/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost as fast</a>&nbsp;as it takes to refuel a regular car. Chinese brands’ success in emerging markets is largely due to their pricing strategy and the variety of models they offer. Tesla is yet to match up to that, John Jörn Stech, an international automotive expert and principal consultant at New York-based Shiftgate Consulting, told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>“Chinese rivals are rolling out new models continuously and making updates to their products,” Stech said. “By comparison, Tesla products look rather staid and stale to Chinese and Asian consumers, who have a penchant for new things.”</p>



<p>Tesla is available in several Southeast Asian markets but lags behind Chinese players in most. For instance, in Thailand, the region’s largest EV market, the <a href="https://carnewschina.com/2025/01/23/byd-crowned-thailands-2024-ev-sales-and-surpassed-toyota-in-singapore/">top five EV brands in 2024</a> were all Chinese, with BYD leading the pack by a wide margin. Tesla came in sixth with just 4,121 cars sold in 2024, compared to more than 27,000 from BYD.</p>



<dl><h3>Experts’ takes on Tesla in emerging economies</h3><div><div><p><dt><h3><dfn>South America</dfn></h3></dt><dd>“Tesla doesn’t offer price points and positioning like Chinese brands. It can’t do that unless it has another Tesla Model 3 moment where a single model takes over the world, which is harder now as the Chinese have elevated themselves.” — <strong>Lei Xing, <em>independent auto analyst.</em></strong></dd></p></div><div><p><dt><h3><dfn>Southeast Asia </dfn></h3></dt><dd>“Chinese brands have expanded their production to the region. Tesla has come a long way in going downmarket, but cutting EV costs is challenging. Only BYD has figured out how to make affordable EVs that appeal to global customers.” <strong>— Martin Schröder, <em>associate professor, College of Policy Science, Ritsumeikan University.</em></strong></dd></p></div><div><p><dt><h3><dfn>India</dfn></h3></dt><dd>“Local manufacturers like Tata Motors have invested in infrastructure and gained valuable consumer insights, giving them an advantage. As Tesla establishes itself, its future moves — like starting local production or launching a budget-friendly model — will determine how deeply it can penetrate.” <strong>— Vivek Kumar, <em>project manager, automotive, at U.K.-based data analysis firm GlobalData.</em></strong></dd></p></div><div><p><dt><h3><dfn>China</dfn></h3></dt><dd>“Five years ago, Tesla was the ‘catfish in the pool of sardines.’ Now it has become one of the sardines as the Huaweis and Xiaomis have become the catfishes. What can it do to become a catfish again? Not much given the much more competitive landscape.” <strong>— Lei Xing, <em>independent auto analyst.</em></strong></dd></p></div></div></dl>



<p>There is limited EV sales data available in other Southeast Asian countries, but Tesla ranks second in Malaysia and Singapore in terms of EV sales, and third in Cambodia, according to Martin Schröder, associate professor at the College of Policy Science at Ritsumeikan University.</p>



<p>“Tesla has been under pressure in Asia as competition from Chinese rivals has picked up dramatically over the past two years,” Stech said. “Given the nearly 50% drop in deliveries in China, plummeting sales in Europe, and a likely drop in sales in the U.S., it is unlikely Tesla will look for expansion markets. They have to fix the markets where they already made significant investments.”</p>



<p>In Saudi Arabia, Tesla is <a href="https://www.agbi.com/transport/2025/01/exclusive-tesla-to-enter-saudi-arabia-within-months/">planning to open</a> its first “pop-up stores” and at least one showroom soon. Reports in <a href="https://www.sagoodnews.co.za/here-comes-tesla-south-africa/">South African media</a> in January said Tesla is close to setting up an office in the country.</p>



<p>But this might be too little, too late. Saudi Arabia, for instance, is backing other EV companies, which might give them an edge.</p>



<p>Until 2019, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, held <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/saudi-arabia-fund-dumped-nearly-all-of-its-tesla-shares-in-the-fourth-quarter-filing-shows.html#:~:text=Watchlist-,Saudi%20Arabia%20fund%20dumped%20nearly%20all%20of%20its%20Tesla%20shares,fourth%20quarter%20before%20the%20rally&amp;text=The%20Saudi%20Arabia%20Public%20Investment,selling%2099.5%25%20of%20its%20holding.">more than 8.2 million shares</a> in Tesla. It sold most of the shares in 2019, and has since <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/lucid-signs-deal-raise-1-bln-saudis-pif-affiliate-2024-03-25/">backed American EV maker Lucid Motors</a> as well as Ceer, an automobile manufacturer formed under a joint venture between the sovereign fund and China’s Foxconn. Last year, <a href="https://www.pif.gov.sa/en/news-and-insights/newswire/2023/lucid-group-makes-history-in-saudi-arabia-as-it-opens-country-first-ever-car-manufacturing-facility/">Lucid officially opened</a> the first car-manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>One market where Tesla has found success is the United Arab Emirates, where the company <a href="https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/findus/list/superchargers/United+Arab+Emirates">has set up</a> supercharger networks across major cities. The country has embraced the luxury positioning of Tesla’s cars, and the company, along with other EV players, has benefited from <a href="https://www.rta.ae/wps/portal/rta/ae/home/news-and-media/all-news/NewsDetails/dubai-licensed-electric-vehicles-get-exemption-from-parking-fees">government incentives</a> like free public charging, preferential parking, and exemptions on registration fees.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>T</span>here was no explanation, no warning. One minute, I was in an immigration office talking to an officer about my work visa, which had been approved months before and allowed me, a Canadian, to work in the US. The next, I was told to put my hands against the wall, and patted down like a criminal before being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/18/canadian-actor-jasmine-mooney-detained-mexico-border" data-link-name="in body link">sent to an Ice detention center</a> without the chance to talk to a lawyer.</p><p>I grew up in Whitehorse, Yukon, a small town in the northernmost part of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Canada</a>. I always knew I wanted to do something bigger with my life. I left home early and moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where I built a career spanning multiple industries – acting in film and television, owning bars and restaurants, flipping condos and managing Airbnbs.</p><p>In my 30s, I found my true passion working in the health and wellness industry. I was given the opportunity to help launch an American brand of health tonics called Holy! Water – a job that would involve moving to the US.</p><p>I was granted my trade Nafta work visa, which allows Canadian and Mexican citizens to work in the US in specific professional occupations, on my second attempt. It goes without saying, then, that I have no criminal record. I also love the US and consider myself to be a kind, hard-working person.</p><p>I started working in California and travelled back and forth between Canada and the US multiple times without any complications – until one day, upon returning to the US, a border officer questioned me about my initial visa denial and subsequent visa approval. He asked why I had gone to the San Diego border the second time to apply. I explained that that was where my lawyer’s offices were, and that he had wanted to accompany me to ensure there were no issues.</p><p>After a long interrogation, the officer told me it seemed “shady” and that my visa hadn’t been properly processed. He claimed I also couldn’t work for a company in the US that made use of hemp – one of the beverage ingredients. He revoked my visa, and told me I could still work for the company from Canada, but if I wanted to return to the US, I would need to reapply.</p><p>I was devastated; I had just started building a life in California. I stayed in Canada for the next few months, and was eventually offered a similar position with a different health and wellness brand.</p><p>I restarted the visa process and returned to the same immigration office at the San Diego border, since they had processed my visa before and I was familiar with it. Hours passed, with many confused opinions about my case. The officer I spoke to was kind but told me that, due to my previous issues, I needed to apply for my visa through the consulate. I told her I hadn’t been aware I needed to apply that way, but had no problem doing it.</p><p>Then she said something strange: “You didn’t do anything wrong. You are not in trouble, you are not a criminal.”</p><p>I remember thinking: <em>Why would she say that? Of course I’m not a criminal!</em></p><p>She then told me they had to send me back to Canada. That didn’t concern me; I assumed I would simply book a flight home. But as I sat searching for flights, a man approached me.</p><p>“Come with me,” he said.</p><p>There was no explanation, no warning. He led me to a room, took my belongings from my hands and ordered me to put my hands against the wall. A woman immediately began patting me down. The commands came rapid-fire, one after another, too fast to process.</p><p>They took my shoes and pulled out my shoelaces.</p><p>“What are you doing? What is happening?” I asked.</p><p>“You are being detained.”</p><p>“I don’t understand. What does that mean? For how long?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>That would be the response to nearly every question I would ask over the next two weeks: “I don’t know.”</p><p>They brought me downstairs for a series of interviews and medical questions, searched my bags and told me I had to get rid of half my belongings because I couldn’t take everything with me.</p><p>“Take everything with me where?” I asked.</p><p>A woman asked me for the name of someone they could contact on my behalf. In moments like this, you realize you don’t actually know anyone’s phone number anymore. By some miracle, I had recently memorized my best friend Britt’s number because I had been putting my grocery points on her account.</p><p>I gave them her phone number.</p><hr><p>They handed me a mat and a folded-up sheet of aluminum foil.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>“Your blanket.”</p><p>“I don’t understand.”</p><p>I was taken to a tiny, freezing cement cell with bright fluorescent lights and a toilet. There were five other women lying on their mats with the aluminum sheets wrapped over them, looking like dead bodies. The guard locked the door behind me.</p><figure id="ae72262c-0271-4803-9d59-3a0507b39d41" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Man on one side of cyclone gate watches people sleeping on cement floor under bright lights." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61780a166d18cc60ef3df041d3307dcde5c1308b/826_906_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="266.9768951194185" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A border patrol agent watches as girls from Central America sleep under thermal blankets at a detention facility in McAllen, Texas, on 8 September 2014.</span> Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>For two days, we remained in that cell, only leaving briefly for food.

I begged for information.</p><p>“How long will I be here?”</p><p>“I don’t know your case,” the man said. “Could be days. Could be weeks. But I’m telling you right now – you need to mentally prepare yourself for months.”</p><p>Months.</p><p>I felt like I was going to throw up.</p><p>I was taken to the nurse’s office for a medical check. She asked what had happened to me. She had never seen a Canadian there before. When I told her my story, she grabbed my hand and said: “Do you believe in God?”</p><p>I told her I had only recently found God, but that I now believed in God more than anything.</p><p>“I believe God brought you here for a reason,” she said. “I know it feels like your life is in a million pieces, but you will be OK. Through this, I think you are going to find a way to help others.”</p><p>At the time, I didn’t know what that meant. She asked if she could pray for me. I held her hands and wept.</p><p>I felt like I had been sent an angel.</p><p>I was then placed in a real jail unit: two levels of cells surrounding a common area, just like in the movies. I was put in a tiny cell alone with a bunk bed and a toilet.</p><p>The best part: there were blankets. After three days without one, I wrapped myself in mine and finally felt some comfort.</p><p>For the first day, I didn’t leave my cell. I continued fasting, terrified that the food might make me sick. The only available water came from the tap attached to the toilet in our cells or a sink in the common area, neither of which felt safe to drink.</p><p>Eventually, I forced myself to step out, meet the guards and learn the rules. One of them told me: “No fighting.”</p><p>“I’m a lover, not a fighter,” I joked. He laughed.</p><p>I asked if there had ever been a fight here.</p><p>“In this unit? No,” he said. “No one in this unit has a criminal record.”</p><p>That’s when I started meeting the other women.</p><p>That’s when I started hearing their stories.</p><figure id="15b065cb-2f5c-4138-8c77-82d5b386b7c0" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02130aba3bc397183cb373086460fb92b49f7b4d/0_0_4064_2704/master/4064.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02130aba3bc397183cb373086460fb92b49f7b4d/0_0_4064_2704/master/4064.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02130aba3bc397183cb373086460fb92b49f7b4d/0_0_4064_2704/master/4064.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02130aba3bc397183cb373086460fb92b49f7b4d/0_0_4064_2704/master/4064.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02130aba3bc397183cb373086460fb92b49f7b4d/0_0_4064_2704/master/4064.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02130aba3bc397183cb373086460fb92b49f7b4d/0_0_4064_2704/master/4064.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02130aba3bc397183cb373086460fb92b49f7b4d/0_0_4064_2704/master/4064.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02130aba3bc397183cb373086460fb92b49f7b4d/0_0_4064_2704/master/4064.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02130aba3bc397183cb373086460fb92b49f7b4d/0_0_4064_2704/master/4064.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02130aba3bc397183cb373086460fb92b49f7b4d/0_0_4064_2704/master/4064.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02130aba3bc397183cb373086460fb92b49f7b4d/0_0_4064_2704/master/4064.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02130aba3bc397183cb373086460fb92b49f7b4d/0_0_4064_2704/master/4064.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Seen from behind, women in blue shirts on a row of bottom bunks." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02130aba3bc397183cb373086460fb92b49f7b4d/0_0_4064_2704/master/4064.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.08267716535437" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Women sit on their beds in a privately run 1,000-bed detention center on 28 February 2006 in Otay Mesa, California.</span> Photograph: Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>And that’s when I made a decision: I would never allow myself to feel sorry for my situation again. No matter how hard this was, I had to be grateful. Because every woman I met was in an even more difficult position than mine.</p><p>There were around 140 of us in our unit. Many women had lived and worked in the US legally for years but had overstayed their visas – often after reapplying and being denied. They had all been detained without warning.</p><p>If someone is a criminal, I agree they should be taken off the streets. But not one of these women had a criminal record. These women acknowledged that they shouldn’t have overstayed and took responsibility for their actions. But their frustration wasn’t about being held accountable; it was about the endless, bureaucratic limbo they had been trapped in.</p><p>The real issue was how long it took to get out of the system, with no clear answers, no timeline and no way to move forward. Once deported, many have no choice but to abandon everything they own because the cost of shipping their belongings back is too high.</p><p>I met a woman who had been on a road trip with her husband. She said they had 10-year work visas. While driving near the San Diego border, they mistakenly got into a lane leading to Mexico. They stopped and told the agent they didn’t have their passports on them, expecting to be redirected. Instead, they were detained. They are both pastors.</p><p>I met a family of three who had been living in the US for 11 years with work authorizations. They paid taxes and were waiting for their green cards. Every year, the mother had to undergo a background check, but this time, she was told to bring her whole family. When they arrived, they were taken into custody and told their status would now be processed from within the detention center.</p><p>Another woman from Canada had been living in the US with her husband who was detained after a traffic stop. She admitted she had overstayed her visa and accepted that she would be deported. But she had been stuck in the system for almost six weeks because she hadn’t had her passport. Who runs casual errands with their passport?</p><p>One woman had a 10-year visa. When it expired, she moved back to her home country, Venezuela. She admitted she had overstayed by one month before leaving. Later, she returned for a vacation and entered the US without issue. But when she took a domestic flight from Miami to Los Angeles, she was picked up by Ice and detained. She couldn’t be deported because Venezuela wasn’t accepting deportees. She didn’t know when she was getting out.</p><p>There was a girl from India who had overstayed her student visa for three days before heading back home. She then came back to the US on a new, valid visa to finish her master’s degree and was handed over to Ice due to the three days she had overstayed on her previous visa.</p><p>There were women who had been picked up off the street, from outside their workplaces, from their homes. All of these women told me that they had been detained for time spans ranging from a few weeks to 10 months. One woman’s daughter was outside the detention center protesting for her release.</p><p>That night, the pastor invited me to a service she was holding. A girl who spoke English translated for me as the women took turns sharing their prayers – prayers for their sick parents, for the children they hadn’t seen in weeks, for the loved ones they had been torn away from.</p><p>Then, unexpectedly, they asked if they could pray for me. I was new here, and they wanted to welcome me. They formed a circle around me, took my hands and prayed. I had never felt so much love, energy and compassion from a group of strangers in my life. Everyone was crying.</p><hr><p>At 3am the next day, I was woken up in my cell.</p><p>“Pack your bag. You’re leaving.”</p><p>I jolted upright. “I get to go home?”</p><p>The officer shrugged. “I don’t know where you’re going.”</p><p>Of course. No one ever knew anything.</p><p>I grabbed my things and went downstairs, where 10 other women stood in silence, tears streaming down their faces. But these weren’t happy tears. That was the moment I learned the term “transferred”.</p><p>For many of these women, detention centers had become a twisted version of home. They had formed bonds, established routines and found slivers of comfort in the friendships they had built. Now, without warning, they were being torn apart and sent somewhere new. Watching them say goodbye, clinging to each other, was gut-wrenching.</p><p>I had no idea what was waiting for me next. In hindsight, that was probably for the best.</p><p>Our next stop was Arizona, the San Luis Regional Detention Center. The transfer process lasted 24 hours, a sleepless, grueling ordeal. This time, men were transported with us. Roughly 50 of us were crammed into a prison bus for the next five hours, packed together – women in the front, men in the back. We were bound in chains that wrapped tightly around our waists, with our cuffed hands secured to our bodies and shackles restraining our feet, forcing every movement into a slow, clinking struggle.</p><p>When we arrived at our next destination, we were forced to go through the entire intake process all over again, with medical exams, fingerprinting – and pregnancy tests; they lined us up in a filthy cell, squatting over a communal toilet, holding Dixie cups of urine while the nurse dropped pregnancy tests in each of our cups. It was disgusting.</p><p>We sat in freezing-cold jail cells for hours, waiting for everyone to be processed. Across the room, one of the women suddenly spotted her husband. They had both been detained and were now seeing each other for the first time in weeks.</p><p>The look on her face – pure love, relief and longing – was something I’ll never forget.</p><p>We were beyond exhausted. I felt like I was hallucinating.</p><p>The guard tossed us each a blanket: “Find a bed.”</p><p>There were no pillows. The room was ice cold, and one blanket wasn’t enough. Around me, women lay curled into themselves, heads covered, looking like a room full of corpses. This place made the last jail feel like the Four Seasons.</p><p>I kept telling myself: <em>Do not let this break you.</em></p><p>Thirty of us shared one room. We were given one Styrofoam cup for water and one plastic spoon that we had to reuse for every meal. I eventually had to start trying to eat and, sure enough, I got sick. None of the uniforms fit, and everyone had men’s shoes on. The towels they gave us to shower were hand towels. They wouldn’t give us more blankets. The fluorescent lights shined on us 24/7.</p><p>Everything felt like it was meant to break you. Nothing was explained to us. I wasn’t given a phone call. We were locked in a room, no daylight, with no idea when we would get out.</p><p>I tried to stay calm as every fiber of my being raged towards panic mode. I didn’t know how I would tell Britt where I was. Then, as if sent from God, one of the women showed me a tablet attached to the wall where I could send emails. I only remembered my CEO’s email from memory. I typed out a message, praying he would see it.</p><p>He responded.</p><p>Through him, I was able to connect with Britt. She told me that they were working around the clock trying to get me out. But no one had any answers; the system made it next to impossible. I told her about the conditions in this new place, and that was when we decided to go to the media.</p><p>She started working with a reporter and asked whether I would be able to call her so she could loop him in. The international phone account that Britt had previously tried to set up for me wasn’t working, so one of the other women offered to let me use her phone account to make the call.</p><p>We were all in this together.</p><hr><p>With nothing to do in my cell but talk, I made new friends – women who had risked everything for the chance at a better life for themselves and their families.</p><p>Through them, I learned the harsh reality of seeking asylum. Showing me their physical scars, they explained how they had paid smugglers anywhere from $20,000 to $60,000 to reach the US border, enduring brutal jungles and horrendous conditions.</p><p>One woman had been offered asylum in Mexico within two weeks but had been encouraged to keep going to the US. Now, she was stuck, living in a nightmare, separated from her young children for months. She sobbed, telling me how she felt like the worst mother in the world.</p><p>Many of these women were highly educated and spoke multiple languages. Yet, they had been advised to pretend they didn’t speak English because it would supposedly increase their chances of asylum.</p><p>Some believed they were being used as examples, as warnings to others not to try to come.</p><p>Women were starting to panic in this new facility, and knowing I was most likely the first person to get out, they wrote letters and messages for me to send to their families.</p><figure id="9e05df49-17ae-4d11-9ff1-be9db93309b1" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id=""><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Two handwritten sheets of lined paper" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb9745505dd4ac3ee32c0219119abbc97cd1b3a/0_0_618_462/master/618.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="332.66990291262135" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Some of the letters given to Jasmine Mooney from the women she met during her time in Ice detention facilities.</span> Photograph: Jasmine Mooney</figcaption></figure><p>It felt like we had all been kidnapped, thrown into some sort of sick psychological experiment meant to strip us of every ounce of strength and dignity.</p><p>We were from different countries, spoke different languages and practiced different religions.

My story had started to blow up in the media.</p><p>Almost immediately after, I was told I was being released.</p><p>My Ice agent, who had never spoken to me, told my lawyer I could have left sooner if I had signed a withdrawal form, and that they hadn’t known I would pay for my own flight home.</p><p>From the moment I arrived, I begged every officer I saw to let me pay for my own ticket home. Not a single one of them ever spoke to me about my case.</p><p>To put things into perspective: I had a Canadian passport, lawyers, resources, media attention, friends, family and even politicians advocating for me. Yet, I was still detained for nearly two weeks.</p><p>Imagine what this system is like for every other person in there.</p><p>A small group of us were transferred back to San Diego at 2am – one last road trip, once again shackled in chains. I was then taken to the airport, where two officers were waiting for me. The media was there, so the officers snuck me in through a side door, trying to avoid anyone seeing me in restraints. I was beyond grateful that, at the very least, I didn’t have to walk through the airport in chains.</p><p>To my surprise, the officers escorting me were incredibly kind, and even funny. It was the first time I had laughed in weeks.</p><p>I asked if I could put my shoelaces back on.</p><p>“Yes,” one of them said with a grin. “But you better not run.”</p><p>“Yeah,” the other added. “Or we’ll have to tackle you in the airport. That’ll really make the headlines.”</p><p>I laughed, then told them I had spent a lot of time observing the guards during my detention and I couldn’t believe how often I saw humans treating other humans with such disregard. “But don’t worry,” I joked. “You two get five stars.”</p><p>When I finally landed in Canada, my mom and two best friends were waiting for me. So was the media. I spoke to them briefly, numb and delusional from exhaustion.</p><p>It was surreal listening to my friends recount everything they had done to get me out: working with lawyers, reaching out to the media, making endless calls to detention centers, desperately trying to get through to Ice or anyone who could help. They said the entire system felt rigged, designed to make it nearly impossible for anyone to get out.</p><p>The reality became clear: Ice detention isn’t just a bureaucratic nightmare. It’s a business. These facilities are privately owned and run for profit.</p><p>Companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group receive <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/06/private-prison-industry-shifts-focus-to-immigrant-detention-centers-funding-immigration-hawks/" data-link-name="in body link">government funding</a> based on the number of people they detain, which is why they <a href="https://theappeal.org/geo-group-earnings-mass-deportations/" data-link-name="in body link">lobby</a> for stricter immigration policies. It’s a <a href="https://investors.geogroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/geo-group-awarded-15-year-contract-us-immigration-and-customs" data-link-name="in body link">lucrative business</a>: CoreCivic made over <a href="https://ir.corecivic.com/static-files/d3f1752e-87b8-4256-99ed-f3803c5817f8" data-link-name="in body link">$560m</a> from Ice contracts in a single year. In 2024, GEO Group made more than <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/recipient/9b308edb-a62c-659b-704b-ef4e5cf3f795-P/2024" data-link-name="in body link">$763m</a> from Ice contracts.</p><p>The more detainees, the more money they make. It stands to reason that these companies have no incentive to release people quickly. What I had experienced was finally starting to make sense.</p><figure id="e7ba1617-07c2-4860-96cc-cacc941c1dc7" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:120,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;‘I escaped one gulag only to end up in another’: Russian asylum seekers face Ice detention in the US&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;e7ba1617-07c2-4860-96cc-cacc941c1dc7&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/17/i-escaped-one-gulag-only-to-end-up-in-another-russian-asylum-seekers-face-ice-detention-in-the-us&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>This is not just my story. It is the story of thousands and thousands of people still trapped in a system that profits from their suffering. I am writing in the hope that someone out there – someone with the power to change any of this – can help do something.</p><p>The strength I witnessed in those women, the love they gave despite their suffering, is what gives me faith. Faith that no matter how flawed the system, how cruel the circumstances, humanity will always shine through.</p><p>Even in the darkest places, within the most broken systems, humanity persists. Sometimes, it reveals itself in the smallest, most unexpected acts of kindness: a shared meal, a whispered prayer, a hand reaching out in the dark. We are defined by the love we extend, the courage we summon and the truths we are willing to tell.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="file-jq-md" tabindex="0" role="region" aria-label="jq.md content, created on 11:54PM yesterday.">
    <article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">TL;DR</h2><a id="user-content-tldr" aria-label="Permalink: TL;DR" href="#tldr"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can take the same source code package that Ubuntu uses to build <a href="https://github.com/jqlang/jq">jq</a>, compile it again, and realize 90% better performance.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">Setting</h2><a id="user-content-setting" aria-label="Permalink: Setting" href="#setting"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I use <code>jq</code> for processing GeoJSON files and other open data offered in JSON format. Today I am working with a 500MB GeoJSON file that contains the Alameda County Assessor's parcel map. I want to run a query that prints the city for every parcel worth more than a threshold amount. The program is</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>.features[] | select(.properties.TotalNetValue &lt; 193000) | .properties.SitusCity</code></p>
<p dir="auto">This takes about 5 seconds with the file cached, on a Ryzen 9 9950X system. That seems a bit shabby and I am sure we can do better.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">Step 1:  Just rebuild the package</h2><a id="user-content-step-1--just-rebuild-the-package" aria-label="Permalink: Step 1:  Just rebuild the package" href="#step-1--just-rebuild-the-package"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">What happens if you grab the <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+sourcefiles/jq/1.7.1-3build1/jq_1.7.1.orig.tar.gz" rel="nofollow">jq source code from Launchpad</a>, then configure and rebuild it with no flags at all?

<p dir="auto">Jq is a complex C program, and C programs of any complexity tend to rely on malloc and free, because the language offers no other cognizable way to deal with memory. Allocation is the top line in the profile by far. What if we use a better allocator, instead of the one that comes in GNU libc? Ubuntu offers a package of TCMalloc, which is actually rather obsolete and not the current TCMalloc effort, but it's an allocator package in their repo, so let's give it a whirl.</p>

<p dir="auto">NVIDIA Dynamo is a high-throughput low-latency inference framework designed for serving generative AI and reasoning models in multi-node distributed environments. Dynamo is designed to be inference engine agnostic (supports TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang or others) and captures LLM-specific capabilities such as:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Disaggregated prefill &amp; decode inference</strong> – Maximizes GPU throughput and facilitates trade off between throughput and latency.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic GPU scheduling</strong> – Optimizes performance based on fluctuating demand</li>
<li><strong>LLM-aware request routing</strong> – Eliminates unnecessary KV cache re-computation</li>
<li><strong>Accelerated data transfer</strong> – Reduces inference response time using NIXL.</li>
<li><strong>KV cache offloading</strong> – Leverages multiple memory hierarchies for higher system throughput</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Built in Rust for performance and in Python for extensibility, Dynamo is fully open-source and driven by a transparent, OSS (Open Source Software) first development approach.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (<a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/doge/">DOGE</a>) has spent the first six weeks of the new Trump administration turning the federal government <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-digital-coup-doge-data-ai/">upside down</a>. It has moved from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-operatives-access-social-security-administration/">agency to agency</a>, accessing sensitive data and payment systems, all on a supposed crusade to audit the government and stop fraud, waste, and abuse. DOGE has posted some of its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/doge-website-offers-error-filled-window-into-musks-government-overhaul-2025-03-04/">“findings” on its website</a>, many of which have been <a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/doge-errors-funding-grants-claims.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/doge-errors-funding-grants-claims.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/doge-errors-funding-grants-claims.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">revealed to be</a> errors.</p><p>But two federal auditors with years of experience, who have both worked on financial and technical audits for the government, say that DOGE’s actions are the furthest thing from what an actual audit looks like. Both asked to speak on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t permitted to speak to the press.</p><p>“Honestly, comparing real auditing to what DOGE is doing, there’s no comparison,” says one of the auditors who spoke to WIRED. “None of them are auditors.”</p><p>In September, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Rs572N9965E?t=2002s">speech</a> during the presidential campaign, then candidate Donald Trump said that he would create a government efficiency task force, headed by Musk, which would do a “complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government.” Musk initially said that he wanted to cut <a data-offer-url="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/29/elon-musk-2-trillion-budget-cuts-trump-election/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/29/elon-musk-2-trillion-budget-cuts-trump-election/&quot;}" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/10/29/elon-musk-2-trillion-budget-cuts-trump-election/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$2 trillion</a> from the federal budget, more than the entire 2023 discretionary budget of <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59727">$1.7 trillion</a>. Musk has since tempered his ambitions, saying he’d aim to cut $1 trillion in government spending. Still, he has alleged that much of this money can be cut by identifying waste, fraud, and abuse, and has continued to claim DOGE’s cuts of agency staff and resources are all part of an audit.</p><p>While there are certainly instances of government money siphoned off to fraud—<a data-offer-url="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105833" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105833&quot;}" href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105833" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a Government Accountability Office study</a> published in 2024 estimated that the government loses between $233 billion and $521 billion to fraud each year—even recovering all that spending wouldn’t amount to the $1 trillion Musk hopes to cut from the budget.</p><p>The auditors who spoke to WIRED allege that not only is Musk’s claim not true, but also that DOGE appears to have completely eschewed the existing processes for actually rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse.</p><p>“An audit that follows Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS), also known as a Yellow Book audit, is conducted in accordance with the standards issued by the US Government Accountability Office,” says the first auditor. Audits can focus on the finances, compliance, or performance of an agency. “That is the gold standard for how you audit the government.”</p><p>There are generally five phases of a GAGAS audit, the auditors tell WIRED: planning, evidence gathering, evaluation, reporting, and follow up. Auditors work to define the scope of an audit, identify all the applicable laws and standards, and come up with an audit plan. Next, auditors conduct interviews with staff, review financial records, and comb through data, reports, and transactions, documenting all the way. From there, auditors will assess that information against policies or procedures to figure out if there’s been some kind of alleged waste, fraud, or abuse and issue a report detailing their findings and offering recommendations. Often, those reports are made <a href="https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2020-09/OIG-20-76-Sep20.pdf">available to the public</a>. After an audit, the auditors can follow up with the agency to ensure changes are being made.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>There are also very technical definitions for what constitutes waste, fraud, or abuse. Waste could mean that there are inefficiencies in a program that might lead to purchasing more of something that goes unused, or paying more for a service than is necessary. Fraud involves intentional deception—for instance, bribery or falsifying business records. Abuse means doing things that aren’t necessarily illegal, but that are unethical. This could look like nepotism or favoritism in hiring, or spending excessively on travel.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOxPJD-VNo">recent interview with podcaster Joe Rogan</a>, Musk said he believed that the government was “one big pyramid scheme” and alleged that “entitlements fraud” is a “gigantic magnetic force to pull people in from all around the world and keep them here.”</p><p>The two auditors told WIRED that going through the technological and financial minutiae of even just a single project or part of an agency can take anywhere from six to 18 months.</p><p>“You can’t coherently audit something like the whole Social Security system in a week or two,” says the second auditor. It’s exactly this rush to crack systems open without full understanding, the auditors say, that has led to Elon Musk’s false claims that <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-social-security-150-year-old-benefits/">150-year-olds were receiving Social Security benefits</a>. “It could be that DOGE didn’t de-dupe the data.”</p><p>“In no uncertain terms is this an audit,” claims the second auditor. “It’s a heist, stealing a vast amount of government data.”</p><p>Federal workers who have spoken to WIRED say <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/surveillance-privacy-doge-federal-employees/">they are worried that their own data</a> could be used to surveil and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/government-employees-lawsuit-privacy-doge/">target them</a> for firings based on their identities or political views. There are also concerns that DOGE could access contracts and procurement data that contain <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-elon-musk/">sensitive information</a> that companies provide in order to work with the federal government. DOGE has also <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gsai-chatbot-1500-federal-workers/">deployed an AI chatbot</a> within the General Services Administration (GSA) and appears to want to expand the use of such tools, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-federal-agencies-ai/">bolstered by access to government data</a>. New court documents also indicate that Marko Elez, the former DOGE representative at the Treasury Department, <a data-offer-url="https://www.yahoo.com/news/doge-staffer-broke-treasury-rules-200703996.html?guccounter=1" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/news/doge-staffer-broke-treasury-rules-200703996.html?guccounter=1&quot;}" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/doge-staffer-broke-treasury-rules-200703996.html?guccounter=1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">shared a spreadsheet</a> with personally identifying information outside the agency.</p><p>And without time spent for auditors to understand a new data system—like interviewing agency staff or learning the coding language—the first auditor believes it’s likely the DOGE team is flying blind. “When they collect a dataset, they don't get it with any sort of description, I imagine,” they say. “There are no terms of use for any government systems … There's no supporting testimony from data system owners, from data system experts. They don't even know the language and the database systems that they're working in. That’s why they keep messing up.”</p><p>The auditors described a lengthy vetting process that allowed them to get the permissions necessary to dive into an agency’s data and systems. In addition to going through the initial vetting process, the auditors say that they are required to engage in continuing education.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“None of them have any auditing background, none have any certifications, none have any clearances,” says the first auditor.</p><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/">Federal workers</a> who have spoken to WIRED expressed concern that DOGE’s operatives appear to have bypassed the normal security clearance protocols in order to access sensitive systems. WIRED found that many of DOGE’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/">youngest members</a>, all of whom were 25 or younger, have very limited work experience, and none in the government. One, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/edward-coristine-tesla-sexy-path-networks-doge/">Edward Coristine, who goes by “Big Balls” online</a>, appears to be a 19-year-old high school graduate. Despite this, they were given high-level access at places like the GSA, the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-operatives-access-social-security-administration/">Social Security Administration</a>, and the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-associate-bfs-federal-payment-system/">Treasury</a>. Others, like those at the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/faa-doge-elon-musk-space-x/">Federal Aviation Administration</a>, come directly from Musk’s own companies and were not fully vetted before their start dates.</p><p>The auditors also noted that even canceling contracts, as DOGE has done, can add to costs, rather than reduce them, in the long run. For instance, often the government negotiates deals on large purchases where it gets discounts for bulk purchases. Canceling a contract likely not only means the government needs to pay some kind of fee to compensate for the contract cancellation—maybe 10 to 15 percent of the contract amount—but if some or part of that purchase needs to be reinstated later, that initial bulk discount will likely be gone, making it more expensive overall. This was the case with many of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-software-license-cancel-federal-budget/">software licenses</a> that DOGE said it wanted to cut.</p><p>Since sweeping through the government, DOGE has canceled thousands of government contracts, including <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/rights-con-taipei-doge-foreign-aid-cuts/">10,000 specifically for humanitarian aid</a>. According to reporting from the Associated Press, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/doge-federal-contracts-canceled-musk-trump-cuts-a65976a725412934ad686389889db0df">40 percent of those canceled contracts</a> through late February will likely not save the government any money.</p><p>“They'll end up costing more in some way, whether it's time, inconvenience, or money,” says the second auditor.</p><p>But the auditors say that there are ways DOGE could get it right. “If DOGE wanted to be the good guys, they could,” says the first auditor. “I’d start by looking at existing Inspector General recommendations.” On the website for the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services, for instance, there are <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/reports/recommendations/tracker/?view-mode=report-grouped&amp;hhs-agency=all">more than 1,200 recommendations</a> that have yet to be implemented that could potentially save the government hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>In an <a data-offer-url="https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/elon-musk-goes-behind-the-scenes-doge-unveils-biggest-source-fraud" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/elon-musk-goes-behind-the-scenes-doge-unveils-biggest-source-fraud&quot;}" href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/elon-musk-goes-behind-the-scenes-doge-unveils-biggest-source-fraud" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">interview on FOX Business</a> with Larry Kudlow, when asked about how his team was identifying what to go after in the government, Musk replied, “We look at the president's executive orders, and we also just follow the money.”</p><p>The auditors say they aren’t necessarily against bringing in people from outside the government to help streamline government processes—something that the government was already doing before Trump was sworn in for his second term. For instance, 18F, the digital services agency within the GSA’s Technology Transformation Services, was explicitly designed to serve as an in-house consultancy that would allow federal agencies to leverage private sector expertise. As part of DOGE’s sweep of the government, however, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-major-government-tech-projects-efficiency/">it has gutted the group</a>, putting a pause on several ongoing projects to make government services more efficient for users.</p><p>And it’s these actions, the second auditor says, that best show that DOGE’s intentions may not be geared toward “efficiency” at all. “It’s a con,” they allege.</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><code>git-who</code> is a command-line tool for answering that eternal question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><em>Who wrote this code?!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Unlike <code>git blame</code>, which can tell you who wrote a <em>line</em> of code, <code>git-who</code>
tells you the people responsible for entire components or subsystems in a
codebase. You can think of <code>git-who</code> sort of like <code>git blame</code> but for file
trees rather than individual files.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">From Source</h3><a id="user-content-from-source" aria-label="Permalink: From Source" href="#from-source"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Building from source requires that you have Go, Ruby, and the <code>rake</code> Ruby gem
installed. Note that these are <em>only</em> required when building from source; you
can download and run one of the binary releases without installing any of these
tools.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ git clone git@github.com:sinclairtarget/git-who.git

<p dir="auto"><em>(In the following examples, <code>git-who</code> is invoked as <code>git who</code>. This will work
automatically as long as Git can find <code>git-who</code> in your PATH. See the <a href="#git-alias">Git
Alias</a> section for more details.)</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>git who</code> has three subcommands. Each subcommand gives you a different view of

<p dir="auto">The <code>table</code> subcommand is the default subcommand. You can invoke it explicitly
as <code>git who table</code> or implicitly just as <code>git who</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>table</code> subcommand prints a table summarizing the contributions of every
author who has made commits in the repository:</p>

<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Options</h4><a id="user-content-options" aria-label="Permalink: Options" href="#options"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>-m</code>, <code>-c</code>, <code>-l</code>, and <code>-f</code> flags allow you to sort the table by different

<p dir="auto">The <code>-m</code> flag sorts the table by the "Last Edit" column, showing who
edited the repository most recently. The <code>-c</code> flag sorts the table by first
edit, so that the authors who committed to the repository earliest are at the
top.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>-l</code> flag sorts the table by number of lines modified, adding some more
columns:</p>

<p dir="auto">You may notice that some files, like <code>lexer.c</code>, are not annotated.
If a file is not annotated, that is because the author who has
most contributed to that file is the same as the author who
has most contributed to the directory containing the file. This is
done to minimize visual noise.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can force <code>git-who tree</code> to annotate every file using the <code>-a</code>

<p dir="auto"><code>git who</code> caches data on a per-repository basis under <code>XDG_CACHE_HOME</code> (this is
<code>~/.cache</code> if the environment variable is not set).</p>
<p dir="auto">You can disable caching by setting <code>GIT_WHO_DISABLE_CACHE=1</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Git Alias</h2><a id="user-content-git-alias" aria-label="Permalink: Git Alias" href="#git-alias"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you install the <code>git-who</code> binary somewhere in your path, running <code>git who</code>
will automatically invoke it with no further configuration. This is a Git
feature.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you install the binary using a different name or just like to be explicit
you can configure a Git alias in your global Git config like so:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[alias]
    who = &quot;!git-who-executable-name&quot;"><pre><code>[alias]
    who = "!git-who-executable-name"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">See <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases" rel="nofollow">here</a> for more
information about Git aliases.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Git Mailmap</h2><a id="user-content-git-mailmap" aria-label="Permalink: Git Mailmap" href="#git-mailmap"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Quite often, people end up committing to a repository under different names or
using different email addresses. For example, someone might make a commit using
the name "Nathan Smith" and their work email address and then later make a
commit using the name "Nate Smith" and their personal email address.</p>
<p dir="auto">How can you make sure that all of someone's commits are counted together
instead of being attributed to three or four different people with slightly
different names?</p>
<p dir="auto">Git already has a solution for his problem called <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitmailmap" rel="nofollow">Git
mailmap</a>. If a <code>.mailmap</code> file is present
in a Git repository, <code>git who</code> will respect it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What Exactly Do These Numbers Mean?</h2><a id="user-content-what-exactly-do-these-numbers-mean" aria-label="Permalink: What Exactly Do These Numbers Mean?" href="#what-exactly-do-these-numbers-mean"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Metrics</h3><a id="user-content-metrics" aria-label="Permalink: Metrics" href="#metrics"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The number of <strong>commits</strong> shown for each author is the number of unique commits
found while walking the commit log. When supplying a path argument to <code>git who</code>, the commits walked include only commits modifying the given path(s).
Here, the rules described under the HISTORY SIMPLIFICATION section of Git log
apply—branches in the commit history that do not modify the given path(s) are
pruned away.</p>
<p dir="auto">The number of <strong>files</strong> shown for each author is the number of unique files
modified in commits by that author. If a file is renamed, it will count twice.</p>
<p dir="auto">The number of <strong>lines added</strong> and <strong>lines removed</strong> shown for each author is
the number of lines added and removed to files under the supplied path(s) or to
all files in the case of no path arguments. In Git, modifying a line counts as
removing it and then adding the new version of the line.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Merge Commits</h3><a id="user-content-merge-commits" aria-label="Permalink: Merge Commits" href="#merge-commits"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Merge commits are not counted toward any of these metrics. The rationale here
is that merge commits represent a kind of overhead involved in managing the
commit graph and that all novel changes will already have been introduced to
the commit graph by the merge commit's ancestor commits.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can supply the <code>--merges</code> flag to <code>git who</code> to change this behavior. The
<code>--merges</code> flag forces <code>git who</code> to count merge commits toward the commit total
for each author. Merge commits are still ignored for the purposes of the file
total or lines total.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Differences From <code>git blame</code></h3><a id="user-content-differences-from-git-blame" aria-label="Permalink: Differences From git blame" href="#differences-from-git-blame"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Whereas <code>git blame</code> starts from the code that exists in the working tree and
identifies the commit that introduced each line, <code>git who</code> instead walks some
subset of the commit log tallying contributions. This means that <code>git blame</code>
and <code>git who</code>, in addition to operating on different levels (individual files
vs file trees), tell you slightly different things.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is best illustrated through an example. If Bob has made dozens of commits
editing a file, but Alice recently formatted the file and made one big commit
with her style changes, <code>git blame</code> will attribute most of the lines in the
file to Alice. <code>git who</code>, on the other hand, will rank Bob as the primary
author, at least when sorting by number of commits. In this case, <code>git who</code>
seems better suited to answering the question, "Who came up with the code in
this file?"</p>
<p dir="auto">If instead, Bob made the same commits but Alice came along later and completely
refactored the file, again in one big commit, <code>git blame</code> will correctly
attribute most of the lines in the file to her, while <code>git who</code> will still list
Bob as the primary author. In this case, <code>git blame</code> seems to do a better job
of answering, "Who came up with the code in this file?". That said, the various
subcommands and options of <code>git who</code> can give you the full picture of what has
happened here. <code>git who hist</code> in particular will show you that Bob was the
primary author until Alice took over.</p>
<p dir="auto">Ultimately, neither tool quite answers what we want to know, which is "Who came
up with the code in this file?", perhaps because the question is too ambiguous.
<code>git blame</code> answers, "Who last modified each line of code in this file?" and
<code>git who</code> answers, "Who made the most modifications to this file / this file
tree?"</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">DEVELOPMENT</h2><a id="user-content-development" aria-label="Permalink: DEVELOPMENT" href="#development"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Test Repository Submodule</h3><a id="user-content-test-repository-submodule" aria-label="Permalink: Test Repository Submodule" href="#test-repository-submodule"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Some of the automated tests for <code>git-who</code> need to run against a Git repository.
A test repository is attached to this repository as a submodule.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to run the automated tests, you will first need to set up the
submodule:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ git submodule update --init"><pre><code>$ git submodule update --init

            <guid>43403377</guid>
            <pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 18:56:53 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/news/release-7.1">https://joinpeertube.org/news/release-7.1</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43403377">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're excited to release version 7.1 of PeerTube, which continues to evolve graphically, but also to simplify your discoverability! Let's take a closer look.</p>
<h4>Redesign of ‘About’ pages</h4>
<p>Thanks to the work of <a href="https://www.lacooperativedesinternets.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">La Coopérative des Internets</a>, the "About" pages of the platforms have been redesigned to make them even clearer and easier to access, with information such as a description of the platform, the terms of use, some key figures, the main rules in clear sentences, etc. We've had a lot of positive feedback and hope you like it too!</p>
<figure>

<h4>Better platform identification</h4>
<p>The concept of platform federation is not always easy to explain, so why not take it one step at a time? That's what this new video component does by highlighting the address of the platform where the video is hosted. Clicking on it gives you an explanation of where the video comes from and you can get more information, such as seeing all the videos hosted on the remote platform.</p>
<figure>
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://joinpeertube.org/img/news/release-7.1/en/peertube7_1-informations-dropdown.png" title="" alt="">  </figure>

<h4>Your PeerTube content as a podcast</h4>
<p>Podcasts are a very popular way of consuming content, so it's important to make them easy to distribute. PeerTube was already compatible with <a href="https://podcasting2.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Podcast 2.0</a>, which brings new features (transcription, chaptering, etc.) to the world of podcasts. Version 7.1 improves support for Podcast 2.0, allowing users to subscribe to channels and play the video audio stream (if available) using classic podcast applications (<a href="https://antennapod.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AntennaPod</a>, <a href="https://podverse.fm/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Podverse</a>, etc.).</p>
<p>In addition, this new version also makes the podcast feed compatible with Apple Podcast, allowing content creators who have correctly added a banner, avatar and description to their channel to submit their <a href="https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#tag/Video-Feeds/operation/getVideosPodcastFeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast feed</a> to Apple.</p>
<h4>Revised views</h4>
<p>The new view protocol, which increases the number of simultaneous viewers by reducing the number of messages sent to the federation, is now enabled by default. We talked about this in <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/news/stress-test-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the stress test we ran on PeerTube</a> in December 2023 (it's a bit technical).</p>
<h4>Verification on Mastodon</h4>
<p>Mastodon's micro-blogging software allows you to link your accounts to certify them. This allows you to say on your profiles ‘This account is also mine!</p>
<p>It's now possible to do this for channels and PeerTube platforms! To do this, add the link <code>&lt;a href="https://my-mastodon-instance/@profile" rel="me"&gt;Follow me on Mastodon!&lt;/a&gt;</code> (replace <code>https://my-mastodon-instance/@profile</code> with your actual Mastodon profile link) to the description section of your channel and/or profile. Administrators can do the same from their homepage settings.</p>
<h4>Playback stability</h4>
<p>We worked hard to update <a href="https://github.com/novage/p2p-media-loader" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">p2p-media-loader</a>, the library that allows PeerTube to run P2P in the video player, to improve the stability of the player, especially for live streams configured in 'low latency' mode! It's certainly less visible work, but it's something we're proud of because it really improves the user experience. Many thanks to the developers of this library who have done a great job!</p>
<h4>And much, much more!</h4>
<p>As always, we're only highlighting some of the improvements to the software, but you can find the full list of changes made by the community in <a href="https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/releases/tag/v7.1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the changelog</a>!</p>
<p>To help us continue to improve PeerTube, you can share this information, <a href="https://ideas.joinpeertube.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggest improvements</a> and, if you can afford it, make <a href="https://support.joinpeertube.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a donation to Framasoft</a>, the non-for-profit organisation behind PeerTube.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your support!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><p>The Trump administration’s Federal Trade Commission has removed four years worth of business guidance blogs as of Tuesday morning, including important consumer protection information related to artificial intelligence and the agency’s landmark privacy lawsuits under former chair Lina Khan against companies like Amazon and Microsoft. More than 300 blogs were removed.</p><p>On the FTC’s website, the page hosting all of the agency’s <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance">business-related blogs and guidance</a> no longer includes any information published during former president Joe Biden’s administration, current and former FTC employees, who spoke under anonymity for fear of retaliation, tell WIRED. These blogs contained advice from the FTC on how big tech companies could avoid violating consumer protection laws.</p><p>One now deleted blog, titled <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/06/20-million-ftc-settlement-addresses-microsoft-xbox-illegal-collection-kids-data-game-changer-coppa">“Hey, Alexa! What are you doing with my data?”</a> explains how, according to two FTC complaints, Amazon and its Ring security camera products allegedly leveraged sensitive consumer data to train the ecommerce giant’s algorithms. (Amazon disagreed with the FTC’s claims.) It also provided guidance for companies operating similar products and services. Another post titled <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/06/20-million-ftc-settlement-addresses-microsoft-xbox-illegal-collection-kids-data-game-changer-coppa">“$20 million FTC settlement addresses Microsoft Xbox illegal collection of kids’ data: A game changer for COPPA compliance”</a> instructs tech companies on how to abide by Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act by using the 2023 Microsoft settlement as an example. The settlement followed <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/06/ftc-will-require-microsoft-pay-20-million-over-charges-it-illegally-collected-personal-information">allegations by the FTC that Microsoft obtained data</a> from children using Xbox systems without the consent of their parents or guardians.</p><p>“In terms of the message to industry on what our compliance expectations were, which is in some ways the most important part of enforcement action, they are trying to just erase those from history,” a source familiar tells WIRED.</p><p>Another removed FTC blog titled <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/05/luring-test-ai-engineering-consumer-trust">“The Luring Test: AI and the engineering of consumer trust”</a> outlines how businesses could avoid creating chatbots that violate the FTC Act’s rules against unfair or deceptive products. This blog <a data-offer-url="https://techprimers.aspendigital.org/hall-of-fame/2023-05-01/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://techprimers.aspendigital.org/hall-of-fame/2023-05-01/&quot;}" href="https://techprimers.aspendigital.org/hall-of-fame/2023-05-01/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">won an award in 2023</a> for “excellent descriptions of artificial intelligence.”</p><p>The Trump administration has received broad support from the tech industry. Big tech companies like Amazon and Meta as well as tech entrepreneurs like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, all donated to Trump’s inauguration fund. Other Silicon Valley leaders, like Elon Musk and David Sacks, are officially advising the administration. Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employs technologists sourced from Musk’s tech companies. And already, federal agencies like the General Services Administration have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gsai-chatbot-1500-federal-workers/">started to roll out AI products like GSAi</a>, a general purpose government chatbot.</p><p>The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED.</p><p>Removing blogs raises serious compliance concerns under the Federal Records Act and the Open Government Data Act, one former FTC official tells WIRED. During the Biden administration, FTC leadership would place “warning” labels above previous administrations’ public decisions it no longer agreed with, the source said, fearing that removal would violate the law.</p><p>Since President Donald Trump designated Andrew Ferguson to replace Khan as FTC chair in January, the Republican regulator has vowed to leverage his authority to go after big tech companies. Unlike Khan, however, Ferguson’s criticisms center around the Republican party’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-bogus-fears-of-censorship-could-spell-the-end-of-content-moderation/">longstanding allegations that social media platforms</a>, like Facebook and Instagram, censor conservative speech online. Before being selected as chair, Ferguson told Trump that his vision for the agency also included rolling back Biden-era regulations on artificial intelligence and tougher merger standards, <a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/technology/trump-ftc-andrew-ferguson.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/technology/trump-ftc-andrew-ferguson.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/10/technology/trump-ftc-andrew-ferguson.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the New York Times reported in December</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWYo_w_A_uU&amp;themeRefresh=1">In an interview with CNBC last week</a>, Ferguson argued that content moderation could equate to an antitrust violation. "If companies are degrading their product quality by kicking people off because they hold particular views, that could be an indication that there's a competition problem,” he said.</p><p>Sources speaking with WIRED on Tuesday claimed that tech companies are the only groups who benefit from the removal of these blogs.</p><p>“They are talking a big game on censorship. But at the end of the day, the thing that really hits these companies bottom line is what data they can collect, how they can use that data, whether they can train their AI models on that data, and if this administration is planning to take the foot off the gas there while stepping up its work on censorship,” the source familiar alleges. “I think that's a change big tech would be very happy with.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Come March 28, those who opted to have their voice commands for Amazon's AI assistant Alexa processed locally on their Echo devices will lose that option, with all spoken requests pushed to the cloud for analysis.</p>
<p>Amazon hasn't formally announced the change, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GQXLLWHBCVL6L5QD" rel="nofollow">help page</a> for the feature still makes no mention of the March 28 deprecation. But the internet souk confirmed to <em>The Register</em> that emails to users about the update, which caused a stir on social media over the weekend, are indeed legit.</p>
<p>"We are reaching out to let you know that the Alexa feature 'Do Not Send Voice Recordings' that you enabled on your supported Echo device(s) will no longer be available beginning March 28, 2025," a copy of the email sent to Echo users relayed to <em>El Reg</em> read.</p>

    

<p>"As we continue to expand Alexa's capabilities with generative AI features that rely on the processing power of Amazon's secure cloud, we have decided to no longer support this feature."</p>
<h3>All your phrase are belong to us</h3>
<p>So there it is, apparently: Alexa's latest generative AI tricks are too demanding for the hardware on the handful of Echo devices that support local processing — the 4th-gen Echo Dot, Echo Show 10, and Show 15. Less powerful Echo gadgets don't have any option for processing locally. Therefore, all spoken Alexa requests are going up into Amazon systems for remote processing.</p>
<p>Privacy-conscious users who enabled the "Do Not Send Voice Recordings" setting won't get a say; it's being disabled automatically. Not that many people bothered enabling the local option in the first place, Amazon claims.</p>

        


        

<p>"If you do not take action, your Alexa Settings will automatically be updated to 'Don't save recordings,'" Amazon told affected users.</p>
<p>"Starting on March 28, your voice recordings will be sent to and processed in the cloud, and they will be deleted after Alexa processes your requests," the email continued. "If your voice recordings setting is updated to 'Don't save recordings,' voice ID will not work and you will not be able to create a voice ID for individual users to access more personalized features."</p>

        

<p>In other words, unless you let Amazon store your recordings, you're stuck with a feature-limited Alexa. And all voice commands are going up regardless.</p>
<h3>Private, for a given definition of privacy</h3>
<p>While Echo owners may not be happy about about losing the option for on-device audio processing, the soon-to-be-scrapped feature wasn't exactly airtight with its privacy protection to begin with.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G4X4X8C26Z73P8SQ" rel="nofollow">Amazon help page</a> that gives more detail on the Do Not Send Voice Recordings option notes that even when audio recordings stay local, a text transcript of each request still gets shipped off to Amazon's cloud for processing anyway. Those transcripts are stored right alongside voice recordings and don't auto-delete — you have to manually purge them via your Voice History, assuming you knew they existed in the first place.</p>
<p>Amazon customers shouldn't be surprised, though: The tech titan's approach to privacy has long raised eyebrows, particularly when it comes to Alexa and the other gadgets it plants in homes to gain an audio and visual foothold.</p>
<p>Studies have <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/27/amazon_audio_data/">claimed</a> that Amazon uses Alexa voice interaction data to help target ads — both on Echo devices and across the web. Third-party apps available for Alexa-enabled devices don't offer much comfort either, at times <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/07/29/amazon_google_voice_apps/">lacking</a> clear privacy policies or adequate safeguards on how user data is handled.</p>

        

<p>Then there's last year's drama in America surrounding Ring cameras, when the FTC claimed the super-corp's lax security controls allowed Amazon employees and contractors <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/25/ring_ftc_settlement/">to access</a> customers' private video feeds. The agency also <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/01/ftc_alexa_ring_amazon_settlement/">alleged</a> that Amazon unlawfully retained Alexa voice recordings of children indefinitely, violating child privacy laws.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<li>2018: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/05/24/alexa_recording_couple/">You know that silly fear about Alexa recording everything and leaking it online? It just happened</a></li>

<li>2018: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/10/15/alexa_sound_recognition/">Alexa heard what you did last summer – and she knows what that was, too: AI recognizes activities from sound</a></li>

<li>2019: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/04/11/amazon_staff_listen_to_alexa/">As Alexa's secret human army is revealed, we ask: Who else has been listening in on you?</a></li>

<li>2022: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/14/voice_assistants_failed/">Voice assistants failed because they serve their makers more than they help users</a></li>

<li>2024: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/04/washington_dc_amazon_prime/">Amazon accused of cheating low-income Prime users out of two-day deliveries</a></li>

<li>2025: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/02/apple_siri_lawsuit/">Apple offers to settle 'snooping Siri' lawsuit for an utterly incredible $95M</a></li>

<li>2025: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/30/amazon_sued_for_snarfing_sensitive/">Amazon sued for allegedly slurping sensitive data via advertising SDK</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon, naturally, denies that eliminating the on-device processing feature will impede user privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The Alexa experience is designed to protect our customers' privacy and keep their data secure, and that's not changing," an Amazon spokesperson told us. "We're focusing on the privacy tools and controls that our customers use most and work well with generative AI experiences that rely on the processing power of Amazon's secure cloud."</p>
<p>It's those generative AI updates, revealed in late February alongside the <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-generative-artificial-intelligence" rel="nofollow">launch</a> of Alexa+, that appear to be driving the change. The three devices mentioned by Amazon as supporting local voice processing (Dot 4, Show 10, Show 15) are all in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCCNHWV5?ref=ods_surl_xaa_us#:~:text=What%20devices%20can%20customers%20use%20Alexa%2B%20on%3F" rel="nofollow">lineup</a> of devices supported by Alexa+, which Amazon is no doubt keen to push users to adopt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike the classic Alexa, which Amazon said will continue to be available, generative AI through Alexa+ - and the fresh stream of user data required to fuel them - will only be available to Amazon Prime subscribers, or anyone willing to shell out $19.99 per month without Prime. Whether you're sticking with Alexa or using Alexa+, commands are processed remotely.</p>
<p>Amazon told us customers will still have plenty of privacy options available, "including the option to not save their voice recordings at all." That feature, as we noted above, means losing out on many essential Alexa features, like the voice assistant being able to recognize an individual speaker and respond based on their preferences, which for many multi-user households is an essential feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We'll continue learning from customer feedback, and building privacy features on their behalf," Amazon said.&nbsp;®</p>
<p>
  <em><strong>Speaking of AI...</strong> Under the direction of President Donald Trump and his US government standards body NIST, scientists linked to the federally funded Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute have been told to talk less about “AI safety,” “responsible AI,” and “AI fairness,” and focus more on “reducing ideological bias, to enable human flourishing and economic competitiveness,” in machine-learning research, WiReD magazine <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-safety-institute-new-directive-america-first/">reports</a>.</em>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p dir="ltr">Today, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Project</a> is excited to announce that the&nbsp;<a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-linux-42-beta/">beta version of Fedora 42</a>–the latest version of the free and open source operating system–is now available. Learn more about the new and updated features of Fedora 42 Beta below and don’t forget to ensure your system is fully up-to-date before upgrading from a previous release.</p><h3 dir="ltr">What’s new in Fedora 42 Beta?</h3><h4 dir="ltr">Anaconda</h4><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><strong>Native Wayland application:</strong> Anaconda is now a native Wayland application in F42 Beta. It no longer supports X11 and instead, users can expect to have more consistent keyboard control with Anaconda being able to control keyboard layouts in the Wayland environment on Live ISOs and the remote graphical installations will use RDP instead of VNC.</li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><strong>Web UI partitioning:</strong> The anaconda team have launched a new web user interface (UI) for partitioning in F42 Beta. With this new feature, the biggest benefit to Fedora users is the new guided partitioning function. This provides a more powerful automatic partitioning, where the user will select a goal and have additional customizations possible. This change also comes with a new "reinstall Fedora" which allows users to easily reinstall their system if something went wrong, and easy support for dual-boot installation. Users only need to make a free space and don’t have to understand other details.</li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><strong>Web UI is now default for Fedora Workstation:</strong> This new web-based UI for the OS installer is now default for Fedora Workstation in F42 Beta. This means that users can enjoy a smooth installation experience, with features such as an installation progress indicator, built in help, configuration review and more. This new feature also includes&nbsp;<a href="https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/anaconda-is-getting-a-new-suit-and-a-wizard/">Wizard</a> that will allow users to skip what they don't need at installation.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4 dir="ltr">KDE Plasma edition</h4><p dir="ltr">KDE Plasma has been promoted to edition status from F42 Beta onwards! You can expect to continue to enjoy the same level of quality from Fedora KDE as you always have, plus Fedora KDE is now supported on power systems (ppc64le). The full KDE stack (including KDE PIM) is also available on power. Additionally, F42 Beta offers installable live images for OpenPOWER based systems like the Talos Workstation from<a href="https://www.raptorcs.com/">&nbsp;Raptor Systems</a>.</p><h4 dir="ltr">Fedora COSMIC spin</h4><p dir="ltr">We have a new spin! Introducing the Fedora COSMIC spin - a new rust-based desktop environment developed by System76, makers of Pop!_OS. COSMIC has many unique features, such as hybrid per-workspace window/tiling management, window stacks with tabs to switch between windows and robust customization features that integrate with GTK and (later on) Qt!&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">EROFS for live media</h4><p dir="ltr">We’ve switched the read-only filesystem image format from SquashFS to EROFS for Fedora live media for all kiwi-produced live media, such as KDE desktop and mobile, COSMIC, Budgie, MiracleWM, Fedora CoreOS live media and more. This change aligns with our downstream and RHEL, which creates a more efficient ecosystem for developers to work in both upstream and downstream.</p><h4 dir="ltr">RPM support for systemd sysusers.d</h4><p dir="ltr">RPM supports creating users and groups according to configuration provided in sysusers.d snippets shipped in package payload. This new feature goes towards fully integrating this RPM functionality in Fedora.</p><h4 dir="ltr">DNF/RPM copy on write for all variants</h4><p dir="ltr">The RPM copy on write feature will provide a better experience for Fedora users as it reduces the amount of I/O and offsets CPU cost of package decompression. RPM copy on write uses reflinking capabilities in btrfs, which has been the default filesystem since Fedora 33 for most variants. Note that this behavior is not being turned on by default for this change.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">Setuptools 74+</h4><p dir="ltr">Fedora 42 Beta will include the latest upstream release of python-setuptools. Setuptools is a package development process library designed to facilitate packaging Python projects by enhancing the former Python standard library distutils (distribution utilities). It changes quickly and often introduces breaking changes such as the removal of the&nbsp;setup.py test command in version 72.0.0 which was deprecated in 2019.</p><p dir="ltr">If your Fedora package still uses the&nbsp;setup.py test command, please update to&nbsp;%pytest,&nbsp;%tox,&nbsp;%{python3} -m unittest, etc.</p><h4 dir="ltr">DNF5</h4><p dir="ltr">There has been some work done with DNF5 that now includes new logic that will remove expired and obsolete repository keys from the system, which means users can enjoy the automatic management of repository keys during software installation or upgrades.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">NumPy2</h4><p dir="ltr">F42 Beta will include an update to NumPy2. Most packages will be unaffected, but those using the C API may need to rebuild. This update brings more up to date fixes, performance improvements and better documentation.</p><h4 dir="ltr">Ruby 3.4</h4><p dir="ltr">Ruby 3.4 is the latest stable version of Ruby. Many new features and improvements are included for the increasingly diverse and expanding demands for Ruby. With this major update from Ruby 3.3 in Fedora 41 to Ruby 3.4 in Fedora 42, Fedora becomes the superior Ruby development platform.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr">Retirements and deprecations</h3><h4 dir="ltr">Retiring of python3.8</h4><p dir="ltr">The<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/File:Package-x-generic-16.png">&nbsp;</a><a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python3.8">python3.8</a> package will be retired without replacement beginning with<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/w/index.php?title=Releases/42&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">&nbsp;Fedora Linux 42</a>. As Python 3.8 is EOL, and Ubuntu’s LTS also goes out of standard support by the release time of F42, we will no longer be supporting this version in Fedora Linux.</p><h4 dir="ltr">Python-pytest-runner</h4><p dir="ltr">The python-pytest-runner package will be deprecated in F42 Beta. Dependent packages are encouraged to switch to using pytest directly.</p><h4 dir="ltr">Atomic Desktops will no longer be built for PPC64LE</h4><p dir="ltr">From F42 Beta, we will no longer be building Fedora Atomic Desktops for PowerPC 64 LE. Users of Atomic Desktops on PPC64LE can either switch back to a Fedora package mode installation, or build their own images using bootable containers which are available for PPC64LE.&nbsp;</p><h4 dir="ltr">Retirement of Zezere provisioning server for Fedora IoT</h4><p dir="ltr">We will be retiring the use of the&nbsp;<a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/zezere">Zezere</a> provisioning server, which is currently used to configure Fedora IoT devices. Instead, we’ve moved the Zezere provisioning server in favour of offering a local means for user configuration -&nbsp;systemd-firstboot. This will provide users with a more robust, well-tested configuration method that is already installed by default with&nbsp;systemd. Users will still be able to use the existing configuration options of&nbsp;FIDO Device Onboarding or&nbsp;ignition.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr">What is a Fedora Beta release?</h3><p dir="ltr">Fedora Beta releases are code-complete and will very closely resemble the final release. While the Fedora Project community will be testing this release intensely, we also want our end users to check and make sure that the features you care about are working as intended. The bugs you find and report help make your experience better as well as for millions of Fedora Linux users worldwide! Together, we can help not only make Fedora Linux stronger, but as these fixes and tweaks get pushed upstream to the kernel community, we can contribute to the betterment of the Linux ecosystem and free software holistically.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Let’s test Fedora 42 Beta together</h3><p dir="ltr">Since this is a Beta release, we expect that you may encounter bugs or missing features. To report issues encountered during testing, contact the Fedora QA team via the<a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/test%40lists.fedoraproject.org/"> test mailing list</a> or in the<a href="https://chat.fedoraproject.org/#/room/#quality:fedoraproject.org"> #quality:fedoraproject.org channel on Fedora Chat</a> (Matrix). As testing progresses, common issues are tracked in the “Common Issues” category on Ask Fedora.</p><p dir="ltr">For tips on reporting a bug effectively, read<a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/howto-file-a-bug/"> how to file a bug</a>.</p>

<p>DuckDB has supported reading Iceberg tables <a href="https://duckdb.org/2023/09/26/announcing-duckdb-090.html">since September 2023</a> via the <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/iceberg/overview.html"><code>iceberg</code> extension</a>. Today, we are happy to introduce a new preview feature in this extension, which allows attaching to <a href="https://www.tabular.io/apache-iceberg-cookbook/getting-started-catalog-background/">Iceberg REST catalogs</a>. This preview release coincides with two AWS announcements yesterday: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/03/amazon-s3-tables-apache-iceberg-rest-catalog-apis/">support for Iceberg tables in Amazon S3 Tables</a> and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/03/amazon-sagemaker-lakehouse-integration-s3-tables-generally-available/">GA release of the integration between S3 Tables and SageMaker Lakehouse (AWS Glue Data Catalog)</a>. In practice, these developments mean that DuckDB now provides an end-to-end solution for reading Iceberg tables in <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/iceberg/amazon_s3_tables.html">S3 Tables</a> and <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/iceberg/amazon_sagemaker_lakehouse.html">SageMaker Lakehouse</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DuckDB's support for Iceberg REST Catalog endpoints in Amazon S3 Tables is the result of a collaboration between AWS and DuckDB Labs.</p>

<p>To connect to Apache Iceberg REST Catalogs in DuckDB,
make sure you are running the <strong>latest stable</strong> DuckDB release (version 1.2.1).
For our example steps, we'll use the DuckDB <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/overview.html">CLI client</a>.
You can obtain this client from the <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/">installation page</a> and start it with:</p>



<p>Next, we need to install the “bleeding edge” versions of the required extensions from the <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/installing_extensions.html#extension-repositories"><code>core_nightly</code> repository</a>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>FORCE</span> <span>INSTALL</span> <span>aws</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>core_nightly</span><span>;</span>
<span>FORCE</span> <span>INSTALL</span> <span>httpfs</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>core_nightly</span><span>;</span>
<span>FORCE</span> <span>INSTALL</span> <span>iceberg</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>core_nightly</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>For more information on using the <code>core_nightly</code> repository, please see the <a href="#footnotes">notes</a> at the end of the post.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With these extensions installed, your DuckDB is now capable of using Apache Iceberg REST Catalogs.
Let's find some data.</p>

      </h3>
    

<p>(If you already have Iceberg tables in Amazon S3 Tables, you can skip to the <a href="#reading-amazon-s3-tables-with-duckdb">“Reading Iceberg Catalogs with DuckDB” section</a>.)</p>

<p>In this post, we demonstrate how to read data from Amazon S3 Tables.
To follow along, make sure that your account has <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-tables-setting-up.html"><code>s3tables</code> permissions</a>
and create a new <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-tables-buckets.html">S3 table bucket</a>.
Note that Amazon S3 Tables is currently only supported in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-tables-regions-quotas.html">selected AWS regions</a>.</p>

      </h3>
    

<p>If you don't have an S3 table bucket with tables already, we found the easiest way to get going is to create a table using Amazon Athena.
See their <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-tables-getting-started.html#s2-tables-tutorial-EMR-cluster">instructions</a>.
For our example, we created a simple table with three columns using the Athena query editor:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>duck_species</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span> <span>INT</span><span>,</span>
    <span>english_name</span> <span>STRING</span><span>,</span>
    <span>latin_name</span> <span>STRING</span>
<span>)</span> <span>TBLPROPERTIES</span> <span>(</span><span>'table_type'</span> <span>=</span> <span>'ICEBERG'</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let's insert some data to the table:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>duck_species</span> <span>VALUES</span>
    <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>'Anas nivis'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Snow duck'</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>
      <h3 id="reading-amazon-s3-tables-with-duckdb">
        
        <a href="#reading-amazon-s3-tables-with-duckdb">Reading Amazon S3 Tables with DuckDB</a>
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Querying S3 Tables with DuckDB is really easy.
The first step is to get your AWS credentials into DuckDB.
You can achieve this in two ways.
First, you can let DuckDB detect your AWS credentials and configuration based on the default profile in your <code>~/.aws</code> directory by creating the following secret using the <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/configuration/secrets_manager.html">Secrets Manager</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>SECRET</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>TYPE</span> <span>s3</span><span>,</span>
    <span>PROVIDER</span> <span>credential_chain</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, you can set the AWS key, secret, and region values manually. For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>SECRET</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>TYPE</span> <span>s3</span><span>,</span>
    <span>KEY_ID</span> <span>'</span><span>AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>SECRET</span> <span>'</span><span>wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>REGION</span> <span>'</span><span>us-east-1</span><span>'</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tip To see the secrets in your session, run <code><span>FROM</span> <span>duckdb_secrets</span><span>();</span></code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, point DuckDB to your S3 table bucket.
You can do so by copy-pasting the S3 Tables ARN value directly from the AWS Management Console and using it in the <code>ATTACH</code> command:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>ATTACH</span> <span>'arn:aws:s3tables:</span><span>us-east-1</span><span>:</span><span>111122223333</span><span>:bucket/</span><span>bucket_name</span><span>'</span>
    <span>AS</span> <span>s3_tables_db</span> <span>(</span>
        <span>TYPE</span> <span>iceberg</span><span>,</span>
        <span>ENDPOINT_TYPE</span> <span>s3_tables</span>
    <span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And that's all! Now, DuckDB is connected to Amazon S3 Tables. 
To show the available tables, run:</p>



<div><pre><code>┌──────────────┬─────────┬───────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬───────────┐
│   database   │ schema  │     name      │ column_names │ column_types │ temporary │
│   varchar    │ varchar │    varchar    │  varchar[]   │  varchar[]   │  boolean  │
├──────────────┼─────────┼───────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼───────────┤
│ s3_tables_db │ ducks   │ duck_species  │ [__]         │ [INTEGER]    │ false     │
└──────────────┴─────────┴───────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴───────────┘
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can query tables as if they were ordinary DuckDB tables:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>FROM</span> <span>s3_tables_db</span><span>.</span><span>ducks</span><span>.</span><span>duck_species</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code>┌───────┬──────────────┬────────────┐
│  id   │ english_name │ latin_name │
│ int32 │   varchar    │  varchar   │
├───────┼──────────────┼────────────┤
│   0   │ Anas nivis   │ Snow duck  │
└───────┴──────────────┴────────────┘
</code></pre></div>

<p>You also have an alternative option to connect to S3 Tables using the Amazon SageMaker Lakehouse (AWS Glue Data Catalog) Iceberg REST Catalog endpoint.
To do so, run:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>ATTACH</span> <span>'</span><span>account_id</span><span>:s3tablescatalog/</span><span>namespace_name</span><span>'</span>
<span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>TYPE</span> <span>iceberg</span><span>,</span>
    <span>ENDPOINT_TYPE</span> <span>glue</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tip If you need basic read access to tabular data in a single S3 table bucket, use the <code>s3_tables</code> endpoint type.
If you want a unified view across all of your tabular data in AWS, use the <code>glue</code> endpoint type.</p>
</blockquote>
      <h3 id="schema-evolution">
        
        <a href="#schema-evolution">Schema Evolution</a>
        
      </h3>
    

<p>A key feature of the Iceberg format is <a href="https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/1.7.1/evolution/">schema evolution</a>,
i.e., the ability to follow changes in the table's schema.
To demonstrate this, we go back to the Athena query editor and add a new column to the <code>duck_species</code> table:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>duck_species</span>
    <span>ADD</span> <span>COLUMNS</span> <span>(</span><span>conservation_status</span> <span>STRING</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then, we insert a few more duck species:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>duck_species</span> <span>VALUES</span>
    <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>'Anas eatoni'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Eaton</span><span>''</span><span>s pintail'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Vulnerable'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>'Histrionicus histrionicus'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Harlequin duck'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Least concern'</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let's run the query again from DuckDB:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>FROM</span> <span>s3_tables_db</span><span>.</span><span>ducks</span><span>.</span><span>duck_species</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The query now returns a table with the additional fourth column, which has a <code>NULL</code> value in the row inserted before the change in the schema
– as expected.</p>

<div><pre><code>┌───────┬───────────────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│  id   │       english_name        │   latin_name    │ conservation_status │
│ int32 │          varchar          │     varchar     │       varchar       │
├───────┼───────────────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│     1 │ Anas eatoni               │ Eaton's pintail │ Vulnerable          │
│     2 │ Histrionicus histrionicus │ Harlequin duck  │ Least concern       │
│     0 │ Anas nivis                │ Snow duck       │ NULL                │
└───────┴───────────────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
</code></pre></div>

        <a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a>
        
      </h2>
    

<p>The latest preview release of the DuckDB <code>iceberg</code> extension enables directly reading tables using Iceberg REST endpoints.
This allows you to query Amazon S3 Tables and Amazon SageMaker Lakehouse (AWS Glue Data Catalog) with ease.
As of today, the extension is in an experimental state and is under active development.
We will publish a stable release later this year.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><strong>Engineers focus too much on technical skills,</strong><span> often overlooking other essential skills, such as </span><strong>soft skills—</strong><span>or human skills, as I prefer to call them.</span></p><p><strong>An engineer is more than a technical skill set</strong><span>. First and foremost, an engineer is a human being immersed in a human environment. If they fail to understand how to navigate human complexity and intricacies, they will not understand how a team or an organization works,&nbsp;</span><strong>eventually reducing their ability to build meaningful things and create an impact wherever they go.</strong></p><p><span>Through years of mentoring many engineers, I’ve learned that&nbsp;</span><strong>engineers who master technical and soft skills are very rare. But those who do hold great power.</strong><span>&nbsp;They can create meaningful and significant impact wherever they go.</span></p><p><strong>Technical skills come with experience and can be easier to learn</strong><span>. That’s why I don’t worry too much about them when mentoring engineers. Instead, I prefer focusing on human skills, which I think </span><strong>are the most impactful but also the most neglected skills</strong><span>.</span></p><p><strong>If, up until this point in your career, you have focused on developing your technical skills rather than your soft skills, don’t despair</strong><span>. You are always one decision away from significantly changing your approach. You can radically change your career by focusing on developing your human skills, </span><em>i.e.</em><span>, by focusing on human development. </span></p><p><span>While “human development” is a topic that may seem alien to many engineers, that shouldn’t be a stopper. Everyone has the capacity to develop their human skills because, after all, we are all humans, and that’s all that we need. </span><strong>Human development is just a matter of being intentional and developing curiosity about the human side of things</strong><span>—and, of course, practicing. Like coding, the more you practice, the better you’ll get at it.</span></p><p><span>My aim with the&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Underrated Soft Skills&nbsp;</strong></em><span>series is to bring a fresh voice to the field of human development for engineers. </span></p><p><span>Every day, I hear more engineers interested in learning topics such as communication, stakeholder management, leadership, etc. While this is great,</span><strong>&nbsp;we are just scratching the surface;</strong><span>&nbsp;we can—and should—go deeper.</span></p><p><span>In this new series, I want to explore</span><strong>&nbsp;the most neglected topics in human development for engineers</strong><span>—or at least those few people discuss. I especially want&nbsp;to highlight the most neglected soft skills,</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>and in doing so, I want to open your eyes to a new way of seeing the engineering practice. </span><strong>I want to show you how soft skills and human development can increase your impact</strong><span>, make you a great teammate, and even make you a better human.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As I said before,&nbsp;</span><strong>engineers who master technical and soft skills are rare. But those who are curious enough to pursue mastering these skills</strong><span>&nbsp;have the power to radically change their careers, their lives, and the lives of those around them.</span></p><p><span>Please join me for </span><strong>the first entry in the&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>Underrated Soft Skills </strong></em><span>series, where we will discuss one special skill:&nbsp;</span><em><strong>charisma</strong></em><strong>,&nbsp;</strong><span>a skill that can transform everything it touches and turn you into a teammate everyone enjoys working with.</span></p><p><em>Charisma, </em><span>more than a trait,&nbsp;is a set of behaviors that are easy to recognize when you see them. You may not have a word for them, but you recognize them, as they are almost impossible to miss. The same holds true for the opposite. When you see uncharismatic behaviors, you recognize them without skipping a beat.</span></p><p><strong>Everyone in their careers has encountered someone who’s challenging to work with</strong><span>. Think of this person as someone who is constantly complaining, creating drama, or the kind of person who never listens to you and is always absorbed by their own dilemmas—so much they don’t have mind space for you. </span></p><p>Pause for a second here. Can you think of someone that fits the description? What do you think is challenging about them?</p><p><span>Of course, there are many challenges to working with someone like that, but there’s one common trait among all those challenges:&nbsp;</span><strong>these kinds of people create tense environments</strong><span>. They tend to lead other people to exhaustion. They can be demoralizing, exhausting, and irritating. They epitomize what I call </span><em>uncharismatic behavior</em><span>—</span><em>i.e.</em><span>, a behavior that arises when someone becomes so absorbed in their own dilemma that they lose sight of the person in front of them. </span><strong>For people adopting this behavior, listening to others, building empathy, non-judgment, and kindness is difficult</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Opposite to this kind of people, there are </span><strong>the ones that we would label as highly charismatic and the kind of people everyone enjoys working with</strong><span>. Pause once again for a second. Can you think of someone that fits the description? What do you enjoy about them?</span></p><p><span>Once again, you might enjoy many traits about them, but there’s a golden thread:&nbsp;</span><strong>these people lift you up and make you feel good about yourself, and when in their presence, you can feel delighted</strong><span>. They are the kind of people that make you feel comfortable and fill every room they walk in with joy. Their kind and warm aura boosts everyone around them—making you, for a split second, think everything is possible. Ideally, </span><strong>these kinds of people can also make you feel seen and understood. They are inclusive and non-judgmental</strong><span>; you know you can safely open up with them and won’t be criticized. </span><strong>They are the ones everyone enjoys working with</strong><span>.</span></p><p><em><strong>Charisma</strong></em><strong> sets enjoyable coworkers apart from difficult ones.</strong><span> Whether we realize it or not, we constantly adopt behaviors that come across as charismatic or uncharismatic—our awareness of this makes the difference.</span></p><p><span>Charismatic people have internalized these behaviors so profoundly that they seem natural, but don’t be fooled; </span><em>charisma</em><span> can be learned. The same applies to uncharismatic behaviors—they become habitual, but they can change.</span></p><p><span>Instead of labeling people as charismatic or uncharismatic, I believe it's more accurate to recognize that&nbsp;</span><strong>everyone exhibits and can learn both kinds of behaviors</strong><span>. The balance between them comes down to awareness—once you're aware of how </span><em>charisma</em><span> shows up, you can consciously choose how to cultivate it.</span></p><p><em>Charisma</em><span> is like the culture of a big country—rich, diverse, and ever-changing. It has many flavors and traditions that appeal to different people. For example, if you go to the South of your country, you’ll see that its traditions differ from those of the North. Same if you compare traditions from the western to the eastern part. Despite this, everyone stands together as one country. Even if it’s not easy to pinpoint why, there are always common things that unite everyone under the same identity. </span></p><p><span>Just like a country's culture,&nbsp;</span><em><strong>charisma</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;is complex because it is not a single trait but a broad spectrum of traits that share things in common</strong><span>. Many people can embody charismatic behaviours in many different ways;&nbsp;it’s up to you to decide how you want to do it. </span><strong>But you must keep one thing in mind: </strong><em><strong>Charisma</strong></em><strong> is all about how you make others feel.</strong><span> If you can master that, embodying charismatic behaviours will be easy for you. </span></p><p><span>Based on my experience and research,&nbsp;</span><strong>you should master three behaviors to embody charisma</strong><span>: establishing meaningful connections, building empathy, and radiating warmth. Let’s examine each one.</span></p><p><strong><span>We tend to perceive people as charismatic only when they can connect with us meaningfully [</span><a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/being_present_increases_your_charisma" rel="">1</a><span>]. </span></strong><span>Humans are naturally wired for connection. We intuitively know whether we feel connected to someone or whether an interaction feels meaningful or not. </span></p><p>For instance, imagine&nbsp;you are on a call with your manager, and they are answering messages while talking to you. You can see how their eyes move around the screen, looking at everything except you. Every time you pause and ask them something, it takes them a while before they answer—or they may even get lost in what you are saying and ask you to repeat what you just said. How would you feel in such a situation? Would you describe this interaction as highly meaningful? </p><p><span>If you felt your manager was not present and paying attention to you during the call, you would likely not label the interaction as highly meaningful. Additionally, you would likely not describe your manager as charismatic [</span><a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/being_present_increases_your_charisma" rel="">1</a><span>]. As mentioned before, we tend to perceive people as charismatic </span><strong>only when they can connect</strong><span> with us meaningfully. </span></p><p><strong>If you want to build charisma, start by establishing more meaningful connections</strong><span>. This means being present and paying attention to other people:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>Focus your attention on the other person.</strong><span> This means that the person in front of you is the only thing that matters for a short time. There’s nothing more important than them. Put away your phone or anything that may disrupt your focus on the other person. Look at their eyes, try to recognize the other human being in front of you, and try to help them feel comfortable talking to you.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Forget about yourself and your dilemmas for a second.&nbsp;</strong><span>Being present for another person is challenging when your feelings carry you away. If you don’t feel centered,&nbsp;</span><em>i.e.</em><span>, you feel stressed, anxious, or agitated. Make space for your feelings and digest them before interacting with others. This will make it easier to forget about yourself for a second and be there for the other person.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Develop a curiosity for what the other person is saying. </strong><span>Connecting with someone else is challenging if you don’t care about what they have to say. Learn to develop a curiosity for the person that is in front of you. For example, instead of just freely talking to someone, picture yourself as a curious interviewer, eager to understand more about the other person and ask unconventional questions that reveal their perspective and experiences. In doing so, you’ll understand more of the person’s background, and building empathy will become easier.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Connect by being vulnerable. </strong><span>It’s easy to hide away from the other person by merely asking questions and not sharing about yourself. Yes, sometimes, you play the role of a curious interviewer. But don’t get attached to that role. You are also another human being. Try to connect with the other by sharing how you see the world and how their experiences relate to yours—when the moment allows it. Connection is all about making the other person feel they are not alone and that you understand them—and that perhaps both of you have gone through the same.</span></p></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong><span> Be aware of undermining the power of connection in the work environment. Some people may feel tempted to think they can separate work from their feelings. But the reality is that it’s not easy. In fact, </span><strong>one of the most significant predictors of high-performing teams and good work environments</strong><span> is the amount and quality of connections you have at work—check [</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFTR-ueP9I" rel="">2</a><span>] for more info.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Empathy means putting yourself in the other person's shoes. </span><strong>Feel what they feel</strong><span>—and if that’s out of reach for you right now, at least it means acknowledging that you may not understand what they are going through, but you respect it.</span></p><p><span>Empathy is key to building meaningful connections and, ultimately, embodying&nbsp;</span><em>charisma</em><span>. Empathy brings people together and creates peace instead of division and conflict. </span><strong>This helps create work environments where everyone enjoys working instead of creating tense environments</strong><span>. </span></p><p><span>If you want to develop empathy, you need to cultivate understanding and let go of judgment.&nbsp;</span><strong>Judgment gets in the way of empathy</strong><span>. We judge other people because we don’t understand them enough and demand unfeasible things from them. However, we must understand that human beings are complex, and we cannot demand immediate change from them. A better approach is to understand where they are coming from and see what kind of help they need, if any.</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>Understand.</strong><span>&nbsp;Focus on asking questions that help you understand the other person's perspective and refrain from judging. When you understand, empathy manifests, and you make other people feel good.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Let it breathe.&nbsp;</strong><span>Many of our conflicts arise from misunderstandings and heated arguments. If you hear something you don’t like when listening to another person, consider not addressing the issue while you are upset. Let it breathe. Sometimes, when you space your reaction, it loses its power, and you have the opportunity to see things with perspective—you could even realize you don’t understand and ask for further clarification. The key to empathy also lies in understanding your limitations.</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>When I think about Charisma, I think about a cup of coffee or tea. </strong><span>A cup of coffee irradiates heat by nature. It doesn’t have to do anything; it has the power to warm you up and make you feel cozy. </span></p><p><span>Charisma is just like that; you feel good when exposed to it. Likewise, if you can find a way to irradiate the warmth of charisma, you will make others feel good just by being present. If you establish a connection with another person or you build empathy, you are already irradiating the warmth of charism. If you want to take things to another level, </span><strong>you can also try to be kind and smile</strong><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong>Use kind speech. </strong><span>Sometimes, you may prioritize direct speech over kind speech. But please keep in mind that you can also be direct while being kind; you just need to find ways to communicate in a way that is mindful of the humanity of the person in front of you; </span><strong>treat the other person as if they were a guest you decided to host in your house</strong><span>—you probably wouldn’t be rude to someone you have let into your house. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Perform small acts of kindness.</strong><span> Small of kindness can go a long way. They can reduce stress and improve our emotional well-being—and the well-being of others [</span><a href="https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/kindness-and-mental-health/random-acts-kindness" rel="">3</a><span>][</span><a href="https://www.ie.edu/center-for-health-and-well-being/blog/compassion-in-action-small-acts-of-kindness-that-make-a-big-difference/" rel="">4</a><span>]. Don’t underestimate the power of doing something good for the other person. It doesn’t have to be big—sometimes it can be as small as saying hi to someone you never say hi to, buying a cup of coffee for a co-worker, or just checking in with them.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Smile.&nbsp;</strong><span>Smile to other people, smile to yourself. In his book How to Smile, Thich Nhat Hanh states, “</span><em>Sometimes joy is the cause of your smile; sometimes your smile is the cause of your joy.</em><span>” Smiling relaxes you and the person in front of you. When talking to someone, always remind yourself to smile, even if it’s just a half-smile. A smile can go a long way.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Engineers are more than just a technical skill set; they are human beings immersed in human environments. Mastering&nbsp;</span><em>charisma</em><span>&nbsp;is a necessary human skill to develop for every engineer; </span><em><strong>charisma</strong></em><strong> is what sets great engineers apart</strong><span>. It’s how you can learn to meaningfully connect with other people, empathize, and uplift those around you by radiating warmth. When you do this, you become someone everyone enjoys working with, increasing your impact wherever you go.</span></p><p><strong>Please remember that&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>charisma</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;is not an innate trait but a set of learnable behaviors</strong><span>. You can transform not only your career but also your relationships and the environments you contribute to by developing your charisma. The choice is yours: remain solely technically proficient or become a more impactful version of yourself—one who fills every room they walk into with joy and makes other people feel good.</span></p><p><span>The journey of human development starts with small, deliberate steps. If you’re ready to explore further, I invite you to join me in the&nbsp;</span><strong>Underrated Soft Skills</strong><span>&nbsp;series. In this series, we will continue uncovering the skills that make engineers not just better professionals but better humans.</span></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charisma-Myth-Science-Personal-Magnetism/dp/1591845947" rel="">The Charisma Myth: How Anyone Can Master the Art and Science of Personal Magnetism</a><span> by Olivia Fox Cabane.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smile-Mindfulness-Essentials-Thich-Nhat/dp/1952692431" rel="">How to Smile</a><span> by Thich Nhat Hanh.</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fight-Mindfulness-Essentials-Thich-Nhat/dp/1941529860" rel="">How to Fight</a><span> by Thich Nhat Hanh. </span></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><span>[1] </span><a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/being_present_increases_your_charisma" rel="">How Being Present Increases Your Charisma</a><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><span>[2] </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asFTR-ueP9I" rel="">Why Having a Best Friend at Work Improves Engagement</a><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><span>[3] </span><a href="https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/kindness-and-mental-health/random-acts-kindness" rel="">Random acts of kindness</a><span>.</span></p></li><li><p><span>[4] </span><a href="https://www.ie.edu/center-for-health-and-well-being/blog/compassion-in-action-small-acts-of-kindness-that-make-a-big-difference/" rel="">Compassion in action: small acts of kindness that make a big difference</a><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>The Utopian Engineering Society </span><strong>is an independent, free newsletter</strong><span>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During Pebble v1, I learned how much harder it is to build a great smartwatch experience on iPhone than it is on Android. It sounds like things have actually gotten worse over the last 8 years. </p><p>I want to set expectations accordingly. We will build a good app for iOS, but be prepared - there is no way for us to support all the functionality that Apple Watch has access to. It’s impossible for a 3rd party smartwatch to send text messages, or perform actions on notifications (like dismissing, muting, replying) and many, many other things.</p><p><img src="https://ericmigi.com/assets/apple-restricts-pebble-from-being-awesome-with-iphones-0-cleanshot_2025-03-12_at_12.07.462x.png" alt="Throwback to 2015"></p><p>Throwback to 2015</p><p>Here are the things that are harder or impossible for 3rd party smartwatches (ie non Apple Watches) to do on iPhone:</p><ul><li>There’s no way for a smartwatch to send text messages or iMessages.</li><li>You can’t reply to notifications or take ‘actions’ like marking something as done.</li><li>It’s very difficult to enable other iOS apps to work with Pebble. Basically iOS does not have the concept of ‘interprocess communication’(IPC) like on Android. What we did before was publish an SDK that other apps (like Strava) could integrate to make their own BLE connection to Pebble. It was a clunky quasi-solution that other apps didn’t like, because it was hard to test (among other things)</li><li>If you (accidentally) close our iOS app, then your watch can’t talk to app or internet</li><li>Impossible for watch to detect if you are using your phone, so your watch will buzz and display a notification even if you are staring at your iPhone</li><li>You can’t easily side load apps onto an iPhone. That means we have to publish the app on the iPhone appstore. This is a gigantic pain because Apple. Every update comes with the risk that a random app reviewer could make up some BS excuse and block the update.</li><li>Because of iOS Appstore rules, it would be hard for us to enable 3rd party watchface/app developers to charge for their work (ie we can’t easily make an appstore within our app)</li><li>Getting a <a href="https://pebble.github.io/rockyjs/">Javascript engine to run in PebbleOS</a> forced us to go through many hoops due to iOS — creating a compiler inside the Pebble iPhone app that in itself needed to be written in (cross-compiled to) JS to work with Apple's restriction on downloadable code can only be JS</li><li>As a Pebble watch/app developer, using the iOS app as relay to the watch sucks since the "developer mode" terminates every few minutes</li></ul><p>As an aside, back at Pebble, we went to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/23/9788146/pebble-time-quick-message-reply">crazy lengths</a> to find a way to let Pebble users to send text messages from Pebble. Our bizdev team did an impressive custom SMS-over-IP deal with AT&amp;T to enable this, but the end result was a pretty rough user experience (messages sent from Pebble didn’t appear in the Messages app on iPhone).</p><p><strong>Here’s the kicker</strong> - it sounds like the situation has actually <em><strong>gotten worse</strong></em>. This 2024 <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jnswire/jns-media/7d/b2/15969695/showtemp_83.pdf">class action lawsuit</a> against Apple states that: </p><ul><li>You must set notifications to display full content previews on your lockscreen for them to also be sent to a 3rd party watch (new restriction added in iOS 13).</li><li>Apple closed off the ability of smartwatches after Pebble to negotiate with carriers to
provide messaging services, and now requires users to turn off iMessage (disabling iOS’s core messaging platform) if they want to take advantage of such contracts between a third-party smartwatch maker and cellular carriers.</li></ul><h3><strong>Why are things so much harder on iOS?</strong></h3><p>Well, mostly because Apple systematically makes it nearly impossible for 3rd party wearable developers to build a smartwatch experience comparable to Apple Watch experience.</p><p>Apple claims their restrictions on competitors are only about security, privacy, crafting a better experience etc etc. At least that’s what they tell you as they tuck you into bed. I personally don’t agree - they’re clearly using their market power to lock consumers into their walled ecosystem. This causes there to be less competition, which increases prices and reduces innovation. DOJ seems to agree. For now at least…Tim Apple <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/03/tim-cook-apple-donate-1-million-trump-inauguration">paid $1m</a> to <a href="https://www.tuaw.com/2025/01/22/tech-leaders-attend-trumps-inauguration-with-tim-cook/">sit near Trump at the inauguration</a>, so who knows how long until Trump tells DOJ to drop the case. There’s also an Apple Watch class-action lawsuit working its way through the system.</p><h3><strong>But we’re going to try anyways</strong></h3><p>The problem is that 40% of everyone who signed up on <a href="http://repebble.com/">rePebble.com</a> still uses an iPhone. So we’re going to make a damn iOS app. I guess we’re gluttons for punishment. Just understand a few things:</p><ul><li>Our watch will&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;appear to have less developed functionality on iOS than Android. This is Apple’s fault, not ours.</li><li>Some features will appear first on our Android app, and then eventually we’ll add them to the iOS app. This is because the majority of our development team uses Android phones, and generally we’re building things for ourselves, so naturally Android comes first.</li><li>I don’t want to see any tweets or blog posts or complaints or whatever later on about this. I’m publishing this now so you can make an informed decision about whether to buy a new watch or not. If you’re worried about this, the easiest solution is to <strong>buy an Android phone</strong>.</li></ul><h3>You can help</h3><p>Apple will never change their ways unless you, the Pebble-curious iPhone user, complain loudly or switch to Android. Which is also hard because Apple tries it’s best to lock you into their platform.</p><p><strong>Are you an iPhone user who wants to use our watches?</strong> Start by posting a comment below this post. Hopefully there will be a lot - let’s show them that people actually want this to improve.</p><p>If you live in the US, tell your elected representatives to support legislation like ACCESS Act and AICO.</p><p>If you live in Europe, thank you for voting for representatives who passed the DMA. We will be <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/ios-interoperability/">petitioning Apple</a> under DMA Article 6 to request interoperability with Apple Watch APIs. </p></div></div>]]></description>

This enables all the baseline Pebble features like receiving notifications, timeline, watchfaces, alarms, timers, calendar, music control, basic fitness tracking, etc. </p><p>The really fun part is that most of the existing 10,000+ PebbleOS watchfaces and apps will immediately work on these new watches, though some may try to access web services that no longer exist.

Read more about on the <a href="https://developer.rebble.io/developer.pebble.com/blog/2016/10/11/Emery-SDK-Beta/index.html">old Pebble dev blog</a>.</p><p>We will publish a companion mobile app for Android and iOS. My friend and past Pebble colleague, Steve, recently joined us to lead this effort. He’s joining crc32, long-time <a href="https://github.com/pebble-dev/mobile-app/actions/runs/13609363513">Cobble</a> developer, who has been working with me since last summer. We’ll also be working on an updated SDK for creating new PebbleOS watchfaces or apps.</p><h2>Availability</h2><p>These watches will be sold exclusively through <a href="http://store.repebble.com/">store.rePebble.com</a>. Due to limited supply of display inventory, both watches will be manufactured in limited quantities. I highly recommend placing a pre-order - we will be manufacturing fewer watches than the number of people who have signed up on rePebble already! A pre-order secures your watch but gives you flexibility if you change your mind - you can get a full refund at any time up until your watch ships. </p><h2>Project Progress</h2><p><img src="https://ericmigi.com/assets/introducing-two-new-pebbleos-watches-6-group_6.png" alt="Left: Core 2 Duo running PebbleOS - Right: Engineering samples"></p><p>Left: Core 2 Duo running PebbleOS - Right: Engineering samples</p><p>Schedule-wise, <strong>Core 2 Duo</strong> is quite far along. We’ve already produced dozens of Core 2 Duo watches for testing and development. We’ve tested and confirmed our <a href="https://i.imgur.com/HwdTncx.mp4">button improvements</a>. PebbleOS has been compiled for the new architecture and runs on the watch. All firmware development is open source - you can follow the fun on <a href="https://github.com/pebble-dev/pebble-firmware/commits/main/">Github</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/channels/221364737269694464/256091649996881922">Discord</a>. Our current schedule calls for shipments to begin in July. </p><p>How are we so far along, given that PebbleOS was only open-sourced in January? Two things helped: a) I took a monetary risk and began product development a bit earlier 😉,&nbsp;and b) we found a supplier who still had inventory of some Pebble 2 components. </p><p><video controls="" preload="metadata" playsinline=""><source src="https://ericmigi.com/assets/introducing-two-new-pebbleos-watches-10-outputjdis.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p><p>Core Time 2 display lighting up! </p><p>For <strong>Core Time 2</strong>, we’ve finished component selection, initial industrial and mechanical design, and found sources for long lead time components. Now, we’re in the middle of creating the first prototypes. </p><p>The grand irony of hardware development is that software development is usually the slowest part of the project. Not this time! We’re extraordinarily thankful to Google for open sourcing PebbleOS, which gave us a massive boost.</p><p>We’ll share more details (like Core Time 2 frame colour options) later this year, as we get closer to mass production. Our current schedule shows shipments beginning in December. Follow along on this <a href="https://ericmigi.com/">blog</a>, via <a href="https://repebble.com/signup">email</a>, on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ericmigi.com">Bluesky</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi">Twitter</a>.</p><h3>Why were these specific specifications selected?</h3><p>Building a smartwatch is an exhausting (😂) exercise of constraint maximization. Think of it as linear algebra - we’re solving multiple equations with multiple unknown variables. The primary constraint is display selection. This choice governs the size and shape of the physical design, as well as being the component with the most power drain and biggest cost. Other variables are Bluetooth chip (governs: cost, software compatibility, engineering time), factory selection (cost, quality, speed, risk), sensors (power, cost, software), battery (size, battery life, cost) and more!</p><p>Despite what Pebble’s second Kickstarter branding proclaimed, solving this inherently requires compromise. It’s a fine line to walk and generally the data is not 100% known upfront, so it inevitably requires some degree of trusting your gut. </p><p><strong>Touchscreen</strong>: we’re adding a touchscreen to Core Time 2. Why? Very specifically, I want to add the concept of ‘complications’ to watchfaces and widgets. Like on Apple Watch, these complications/widgets will show glanceable information like weather, next calendar event, step count, etc. The touch screen adds the ability to tap on the complication and directly open the associated app. This is much faster to use than opening an app via the button menu, and saves your quick launch (long-press on the buttons) for other apps. The touchscreen may be used for other interactions, like swiping to rapidly scroll down a list, but that will be lower priority. </p><p>Core Time 2 will be the first PebbleOS watch to ship with a touchscreen, but not the first that we designed! In 2015, Pebble designed it into a watch called Cutts (or C2) and did some (very) preliminary software development work to integrate a touchscreen into PebbleOS.</p><p><strong>Battery life</strong>: I’m really excited that battery life will be increased from 7 days to 1 month! This is due to massive improvements in Bluetooth chip power efficiency over the last 10 years. </p><p><strong>Speaker</strong>: we’re adding this primarily for potential use in apps that benefit from audio output, like a ChatGPT or other AI agent app. It can’t easily be used for making voice calls, since the watches will not support Bluetooth Classic (required for headset profiles), but theoretically someone could write a custom voice calling client (eg SIP or something).</p><p><strong>Smartstraps</strong>: neither watch will support smartstraps. Sorry. Most people don’t even remember this feature even existed, which is kinda the answer to why it will not be supported. RIP.</p><h3>You shouldn’t get one if…</h3><p><strong>You need a perfectly polished smartwatch.</strong> This project is a labour of love rather than a startup trying to sell millions of watches. There may be some rough edges (literally). Things will get delayed. Some features will not be ready at launch. Things could break. Things could not last as long as you’d like. The only thing we can guarantee is that it will be awesome and a lot of fun! Every time you look down at your watch, you will smile 🙂</p><p><strong>You’re looking for a fitness or sports watch</strong>. That’s not what we’re making. From what we hear, Garmin watches are great for runners/cyclists/triathletes!   </p><p><strong>You’re comparing this to an Apple Watch</strong>. There is NO way for a 3rd party smartwatch to compete with Apple Watch. Apple restricts 3rd parties in major ways - read <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/apple-restricts-pebble-from-being-awesome-with-iphones">my blog post</a> for more information. For example, 3rd party watches on iOS cannot send replies to notifications.   </p><p>These watches are not made for everyone. We want to be upfront with you about what to expect. </p><blockquote><p>Watch images above feature impeccably designed watchfaces from <a href="https://ttmm.is/pebble/">TTMM</a>, including one of my all-time favourites - <a href="https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/57812aa56c21044501000ed5?query=ttmm&amp;section=watchfaces">TTMMBRN</a>.
