                                        <p>ATLANTA (AP) — The first American nuclear reactor to be built from scratch in decades is sending electricity reliably to the grid, but the cost of the Georgia power plant could discourage utilities from pursuing nuclear power as a path to a carbon-free future.</p><p>Georgia Power Co. announced Monday that Unit 3 at <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-nuclear-power-plant-vogtle-rates-costs-75c7a413cda3935dd551be9115e88a64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plant Vogtle</a></span>, southeast of Augusta, has completed testing and is now in commercial operation, seven years late and $17 billion over budget.</p><p>At its full output of 1,100 megawatts of electricity, Unit 3 can power 500,000 homes and businesses. A number of other utilities in Georgia, Florida and Alabama are receiving the electricity, in addition to the 2.7 million customers of Southern Co. subsidiary Georgia Power.</p>
    

<p>“This hadn’t been done in this country from start to finish in some 30-plus years,” Chris Womack, CEO of Atlanta-based Southern Co. said Monday in a telephone interview. “So to do this, to get this done, to get this done right, is a wonderful accomplishment for our company, for the state and for the customers here in Georgia.”</p><p>A fourth reactor is also nearing completion at the site, where two earlier reactors have been generating electricity for decades. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Friday said <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-power-nuclear-reactor-vogtle-fuel-b652701435e0f74e229a6d2204ed1128" target="_blank" rel="noopener">radioactive fuel could be loaded into Unit 4</a></span>, a step expected to take place before the end of September. Unit 4 is scheduled to enter commercial operation by March.</p>





<p>The third and fourth reactors were originally supposed to cost $14 billion, but are now on track to cost their owners $31 billion. That doesn’t include $3.7 billion that original contractor Westinghouse paid to the owners to walk away from the project. That brings total spending to almost $35 billion.</p><p>The third reactor was supposed to start generating power in 2016 when construction began in 2009.</p>
    

<p>Vogtle is important because government officials and some utilities are <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-business-environment-and-nature-bill-gates-nuclear-power-90689f06e1cf0271710e07e8b3ba8e09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">again looking to nuclear power</a></span> to alleviate climate change by generating electricity without burning natural gas, coal and oil. But most focus in the U.S. currently is on smaller nuclear reactors, which advocates hope can be built without the cost and schedule overruns that have plagued Vogtle. For its part, Womack said Southern Co. isn’t looking to add any more reactors to its fleet.</p><p>“In terms of us making additional investments, at this time is not something that we’re going to do, but I do think others in this country should move in that direction,” Womack said.</p><p>In Georgia, almost every electric customer will pay for Vogtle. Georgia Power currently owns 45.7% of the reactors. Smaller shares are owned by Oglethorpe Power Corp., which provides electricity to member-owned cooperatives, the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia and the city of Dalton. Oglethorpe and MEAG plan to sell power to cooperatives and municipal utilities across Georgia, as well in Jacksonville, Florida, and parts of Alabama and the Florida Panhandle.</p><p>Georgia Power’s residential customers are projected to pay more than $926 apiece as part of an ongoing finance charge and elected public service commissioners have <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-georgia-atlanta-augusta-georgia-power-co-44dd6e5968cb58ac040fb97e8218b813" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved a rate increase</a></span>. Residential customers will pay $4 more per month as soon as the third unit begins generating power. That could hit bills in August, two months after residential customers saw a $16-a-month increase <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-power-public-service-commission-rates-bills-f907a05efb08717b39c45bd6f98b10c4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to pay for higher fuel costs</a></span>.</p><p>The high construction costs have wiped out any future benefit from low nuclear fuel costs in the future, experts have repeatedly testified before commissioners.</p>
    

<p>“The cost increases and schedule delays have completely eliminated any benefit on a life-cycle cost basis,” Tom Newsome, director of utility finance for the commission, testified Thursday in a Georgia Public Service Commission hearing examining spending.</p><p>The utility will face a fight from longtime opponents of the plant, many of whom note that power generated from solar and wind would be cheaper. They say letting Georgia Power make ratepayers pay for mistakes will unfairly bolster the utility’s profits.</p><p>“While capital-intensive and expensive projects may benefit Georgia Power’s shareholders who have enjoyed record profits throughout Vogtle’s beleaguered construction, they are not the least-cost option for Georgians who are feeling the sting of repeated bill increases,” Southern Environmental Law Center staff attorney Bob Sherrier said in a statement.</p><p>Commissioners will decide later who pays for the remainder of the costs of Vogtle, including the fourth reactor. Customers will pay for the share of spending that commissioners determine was prudent, while the company and its shareholders will have to pay for spending commissioners decide was wasteful.</p><p>Georgia Power CEO Kim Greene said the company hasn’t decided how much it will ask customers to pay.</p><p>“That will be determined as we move closer and closer to our prudence filing, but we have not made a final determination,” Greene said.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/paul-reubens-dead-pee-wee-herman-1235683504/">https://variety.com/2023/film/news/paul-reubens-dead-pee-wee-herman-1235683504/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36946107">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
	<a href="https://variety.com/t/paul-reubens/" id="auto-tag_paul-reubens" data-tag="paul-reubens">Paul Reubens</a>, the actor best known for portraying the irrepressible, joyfully childlike <a href="https://variety.com/t/pee-wee-herman/" id="auto-tag_pee-wee-herman" data-tag="pee-wee-herman">Pee-wee Herman</a>, died Sunday night after a private bout of cancer. He was 70.</p>



<p>
	“Please accept my apology for not going public with what I’ve been facing the last six years,” wrote Reubens in a statement <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CvXme4ZxAR0/?img_index=2" target="_blank">posted to Instagram</a> after his death. “I have always felt a huge amount of love and respect from my friends, fans and supporters. I have loved you all so much and enjoyed making art for you.”</p>



<p>
	The Pee-wee Herman character was known for his bright red bowtie, grey suit and flattop haircut, and delivered his well-known catchphrases like “I know you are, what am I?” in a distinctive squeaky, high-pitched voice. 

	</p>




<p>
	“Last night we said farewell to Paul Reubens, an iconic American actor, comedian, writer and producer whose beloved character Pee-wee Herman delighted generations of children and adults with his positivity, whimsy and belief in the importance of kindness,” wrote Reubens’ estate in the caption. “Paul bravely and privately fought cancer for years with his trademark tenacity and wit. A gifted and prolific talent, he will forever live in the comedy pantheon and in our hearts as a treasured friend and man of remarkable character and generosity of spirit.”</p>



<p>
	Reubens began his career in the 1970s after joining the Los Angeles live comedy troupe the Groundlings as an improvisational comedian and stage actor. In 1980, he launched “The Pee-wee Herman Show,” a stage production centered on a fictional character he had been developing for years. As Pee-wee became a cult figure, Reubens’ show ran for five sold-out months, and he landed a special at HBO. Reubens also committed to the character in his interviews and public appearances.</p>



<p>
	In 1985, he teamed with Tim Burton on “Pee-wee’s Big Adventure,” the character’s feature film debut, which was a critical and commercial success. Reubens returned three years later for a follow-up film, “Big Top Pee-wee,” helmed by Randal Kleiser. The character transitioned to television from 1986 to 1990, on CBS’ weekend morning show “Pee-wee’s Playhouse.”</p>



<p>
	Influenced by vintage kids’ shows like “Captain Kangaroo,” the artistically groundbreaking “Pee-wee’s Playhouse” won several Emmys and featured colorful postmodernist set design and music from New Wave icons like Mark Mothersbaugh, Cyndi Lauper and the Residents, along with guest stars including Laurence Fishburne, Natasha Lyonne and Jimmy Smits. </p>



<p>
	Reubens had already decided to end “Pee-wee’s Playhouse” when his image as a beloved childhood hero was tarnished in 1991, after he was arrested for indecent exposure at an adult movie theater in Sarasota, Fla. At the center of a national sex scandal, Reubens backed away from Pee-wee and began doing press as himself. In the aftermath of the arrest, he did receive support from his fans and other celebrities, and appeared <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA2wNJXx6kE" target="_blank">at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards</a>, receiving a standing ovation. “Heard any good jokes lately?” he said to the crowd.

	</p>




<p>
	He wouldn’t again reprise the iconic role until 2010, when he revived “The Pee-wee Herman Show” on Broadway and made several other appearances, on “WWE Raw” and in a couple of digital sketches for Funny or Die. In 2016, Reubens co-wrote and starred in Netflix’s “Pee-wee’s Big Holiday,” a sequel to 1988’s “Big Top,” which would serve as Reubens’ final film role before his death.</p>



<p>
	Throughout his career, Reubens starred in a variety of other projects as well, including Kinka Usher’s superhero comedy “Mystery Men” and Ted Demme’s biographical crime drama “Blow.” He also appeared in “Batman Returns,” “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” “The Nightmare Before Christmas” and “Matilda,” and his television credits include “30 Rock,” “The Blacklist,” “Pushing Daisies,” “Hercules,” “Rugrats,” “Reno 911!” and “What We Do in the Shadows.” </p>



<p>
	In 2002, after turning himself in to the Hollywood division of the Los Angeles Police Department, Reubens was charged with misdemeanor possession of obscene material improperly depicting a child under the age of 18 in sexual conduct. A self-proclaimed collector of erotica, Reubens disagreed with the city’s classification of pornography. His child pornography charges were dropped in 2004 after he agreed to plead guilty to a lesser misdemeanor obscenity charge.</p>



<p>
	In an interview with NBC News’ Stone Phillips, Herman said in 2005: “One thing I want to make very, very clear, I don’t want anyone for one second to think that I am titillated by images of children. It’s not me. You can say lots of things about me. And you might. The public may think I’m weird. They may think I’m crazy or anything that anyone wants to think about me. That’s all fine. As long as one of the things you’re not thinking about me is that I’m a pedophile. Because that’s not true.”</p>



<p>
	Before his death, Reubens was developing two Pee-wee Herman projects, one a black comedy titled “The Pee-wee Herman Story” and the other a family adventure film called “Pee-wee’s Playhouse: The Movie.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What are we doing?</h3>
<p dir="auto">We’re updating the first million selling computer book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games" rel="nofollow">BASIC Computer Games</a>, for 2022 and beyond!</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://annarchive.com/files/Basic_Computer_Games_Microcomputer_Edition.pdf" rel="nofollow">Read the original book</a> (pdf)</li>
<li><a href="https://troypress.com/wp-content/uploads/user/js-basic/index.html" rel="nofollow">Play the original games in your browser</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Where can we discuss it?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Please see <a href="https://discourse.codinghorror.com/t/-/7927" rel="nofollow">the discussion here</a> for a worklog and conversation around this project.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Project structure</h3>
<p dir="auto">I have moved all <a href="http://www.vintage-basic.net/games.html" rel="nofollow">the original BASIC source code</a> into a folder for each project in the original book (first volume). Note that Lyle Kopnicky has generously normalized all the code (thanks Lyle!) to run against <a href="http://www.vintage-basic.net/download.html" rel="nofollow">Vintage Basic</a> circa 2009:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I’ve included all the games here for your tinkering pleasure. I’ve tested and tweaked each one of them to make sure they’ll run with Vintage BASIC, though you may see a few oddities. That’s part of the fun of playing with BASIC: it never works quite the same on two machines. The games will play better if you keep CAPS LOCK on, as they were designed to be used with capital-letter input.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Each project has subfolders corresponding to the languages we’d like to see the games ported to. This is based on the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" rel="nofollow">2022 TIOBE index of top languages</a> that are <em><strong>memory safe</strong></em> and <em><strong>general purpose scripting languages</strong></em> per <a href="https://discourse.codinghorror.com/t/-/7927/34" rel="nofollow">this post</a>:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>C#</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Kotlin</li>
<li>Lua</li>
<li>Perl</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Rust</li>

</ol>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><g-emoji alias="loudspeaker" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4e2.png">📢</g-emoji> Note that in March 2022 we removed Pascal / Object Pascal and replaced it with Rust as we couldn’t determine if Pascal is effectively memory safe. We’ve also added Lua, as it made the top 20 in TIOBE (as of 2022) and it is both memory safe and a scripting language. The Pascal ports were moved to the alternate languages folder.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><g-emoji alias="warning" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/26a0.png">⚠️</g-emoji> Please note that we have decided, as a project, that we <strong>do not want any IDE-specific or build-specific files in the repository.</strong> Please refrain from committing any files to the repository that only exist to work with a specific IDE or a specific build system.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Alternate Languages</h3>
<p dir="auto">If you wish to port one of the programs to a language not in our list – that is, a language which is either not memory safe, or not a general purpose scripting language, you can do so via the <code>00_Alternate_Languages</code> folder. Place your port in the appropriate game subfolder, in a subfolder named for the language. Please note that these ports are appreciated, but they will not count toward the donation total at the end of the project.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Project goals</h3>
<p dir="auto">Feel free to begin converting these classic games into the above list of modern, memory safe languages. In fact, courtesy of @mojoaxel, you can even view the JavaScript versions in your web browser at</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://coding-horror.github.io/basic-computer-games/" rel="nofollow">https://coding-horror.github.io/basic-computer-games/</a></p>
<p dir="auto">But first, a few guidelines:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>These are very old games</strong>. They date from the mid-70s so they’re not exactly examples of what kids (or anyone, really?) would be playing these days. Consider them more like classic programming exercises to teach programming.  We’re paying it forward by converting them into modern languages, so the next generation can learn from the programs in this classic book – and compare implementations across common modern languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Stay true to the original program</strong>. These are mostly unsophisticated, simple command line / console games, so we should strive to replicate the command line / console output and behavior illustrated in the original book. See the README in the project folder for links to the original scanned source input and output. Try <a href="https://troypress.com/wp-content/uploads/user/js-basic/index.html" rel="nofollow">running the game in your browser</a>. Avoid the impulse to add features; keep it simple, <em>except</em> for modern conventions, see next item 👇</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Please DO update for modern coding conventions</strong>. Support uppercase and lowercase. Use structured programming. Use subroutines. Try to be an example of good, modern coding practices!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Use lots of comments to explain what is going on</strong>. Comment liberally! If there were clever tricks in the original code, decompose those tricks into simpler (even if more verbose) code, and use comments to explain what’s happening and why. If there is something particularly tricky about a program, edit the <strong>Porting Notes</strong> section of the <code>readme.md</code> to let everyone know. Those <code>GOTO</code>s can be very pesky..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Please don’t get <em>too</em> fancy</strong>. Definitely use the most recent versions and features of the target language, but also try to keep the code samples simple and explainable – the goal is to teach programming in the target language, not necessarily demonstrate the cleverest one-line tricks, or big system "enterprise" coding techniques designed for thousands of lines of code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Please don't check in any build specific or IDE specific files</strong>. We want the repository to be simple and clean, so we have ruled out including any IDE or build system specific files from the repository. Git related files are OK, as we are using Git and this is GitHub. 😉</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Emulation and Bugfixes</h3>
<p dir="auto">We want the general behavior of the original programs to be preserved, <em>however</em>, we also want to update them, specifically:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>allow both UPPERCASE and lowercase input and display</li>
<li>incorporate any bugfixes to the original programs; see the <code>readme.md</code> in the game folder</li>
<li>improved error handling for bad or erroneous input</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Please note that on the back of the Basic Computer Games book it says <strong>Microsoft 8K Basic, Rev 4.0 was the version David Ahl used to test</strong>, so that is the level of compatibility we are looking for. &nbsp;QBasic on the DOS emulation is a&nbsp;later version of Basic but one that retains downwards compatibility so far in our testing. To verify behavior, try <a href="https://troypress.com/wp-content/uploads/user/js-basic/index.html" rel="nofollow">running the programs in your browser</a> with <a href="https://github.com/inexorabletash/jsbasic/">JS BASIC, effectively Applesoft BASIC</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Have fun!</h3>
<p dir="auto">Thank you for taking part in this project to update a classic programming book – one of the most influential programming books in computing history – for 2022 and beyond!</p>
<p dir="auto">NOTE: per <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/updating-the-single-most-influential-book-of-the-basic-era/" rel="nofollow">the official blog post announcement</a>, I will be <strong>donating $5 for each contributed program in the 10 agreed upon languages to <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/" rel="nofollow">Girls Who Code</a></strong>.</p>

<p>With a sudden reward of mud at their feet, researchers at the EGRIP research station had successfully made it through the 2670-meter ice sheet last week after seven years of drilling. In doing so, the research group met their ultimate goal of drilling all the way through the ice and to the bedrock below.</p>
<p>"This is the first time that a deep ice core has been drilled through an ice stream, so it will be extremely exciting to analyse the material, which has much to tell us about how our planet’s climate has changed over the past 120,000 years. But we need to wrap up our work here first," says Professor Dorthe Dahl-Jensen of the University of Copenhagen’s Niels Bohr Institute, who leads research at EGRIP.</p>
<p>The mud, which had not seen the light of day for roughly a million years, was only briefly exposed to sunlight, as white light can damage ice core material. Instead, the core was retrieved in red light and immediately packed away, like a Christmas present that will need to remain unopened until some special day down the road.</p>

<p>"Though it was tempting to take a closer look, we quickly sealed the ice core, kept it frozen and sent it to Kangerlussuaq Airport, where it is now waiting for a flight to Denmark," says Dorthe Dahl-Jensen.</p>
<h2>Results could change climate models</h2>
<p>Despite the quick packaging and send off, the drilling has already delivered the scientists research "gold".</p>

<p>"The results are exceptional. The ice stream flows like a river of ice that tears itself free of the surrounding slow-flowing ice sheet. We can see that the entire 2670-meter-thick mass of ice flows like a block at a speed of 58 meters per year. This will change climate models because it redefines our basic understanding of how ice moves," explains Dorthe Dahl-Jensen, who continues:</p>
<p>"The block of ice floats on a layer of wet mud. It seems to act as a kind of layer of quicksand that allows the ice block to flow undisturbed across the bedrock. Near the bottom of the ice sheet, we find rocks and sand embedded in the ice. The measurements also show that the ice is melting at the bottom," she says.</p>
<p>Towards the base, the ice is more than 120,000 years old and dates back to the last interglacial period, a time when the atmospheric temperature above Greenland was 5°C warmer than today.</p>
<h2>Last drill got stuck</h2>
<p>The last ice core was drilled on July 21, 2023. These final 4 meters of ice were drilled using a rock coring system due to the presence of pebbles in the ice.</p>
<p>Chief ice core driller Steffen Bo Hansen of the Niels Bohr Institute was on hand when the breakthrough took place:</p>
<p>"The rock drill became stuck at the bottom and we feared that we would lose both the last core and drill itself. Loosening the drill was tough because it got stuck in the wet mud at the bottom. Fortunately, we succeeded. We have now successfully drilled through the ice stream, and it was amazing to find mud beneath the ice," he says.</p>
<h2>A 2670-meter-long account of Earth's climate</h2>
<p>All in all, the ice core is a 2670-meter-long record that tells of how our planet’s climate has changed over the past 120,000 years. It will be analyzed in dozens of laboratories around the world.</p>
<p>Due to the ice core’s outstanding quality, the scientists expect to be able to document the climate surrounding the ice during both the warmer and colder periods of the 11,700 years since the last ice age, as well as the anthropogenic changes caused by human development.</p>

<p>Analyses of the last ice cores will begin in fall, when the research group returns to Copenhagen. The EGRIP ice core is stored in the Danish ice core repository in the Copenhagen suburb Brøndby together with most of the deep Greenland ice cores. Samples from the ice cores drilled the previous years have been analyzed in more than 30 laboratories and the first 53 papers have been published.</p>

<h3>Facts about the EGRIP camp, new technology and innovation.</h3>
<div>
<p>The EGRIP camp is mobile. The main building, “The Dome”, is on skis, while the rest of the equipment and infrastructure is on sledges. This allows the entire camp to be removed and towed by tracked vehicles to new drilling sites on the Greenland Ice Sheet.</p>

<p>A drill trench and science trench were constructed beneath the snow surface by inflating balloons with a diameter of five meters and a length of 45 meters in seven-meter-deep trenches dug into the snow. Snow was then blown over the tops of the balloons. After a few days, the balloons were deflated and removed, after which the trenches were ready for drill operations and ice core analyses.</p>

<h2>A key to understanding rising sea levels</h2>
<p>The loss of ice from Greenland’s ice sheet is a major contributor to rising sea levels and is expected to increase as temperatures over Greenland edge ever upwards. Half of this ice loss comes from Greenland’s ice streams, whose behavior is still not well understood.</p>
<p>Thus, knowledge of how Greenland’s ice streams move is a key to understanding how sea levels will rise in the future and will serve to improve the accuracy of projections.</p>
<p>"I'm thrilled about the success. I’ve followed the flow of ice by measuring the borehole’s shape over the years using a borehole logger. The fact that the ice is not dislodged, but slides as a block over mud, will improve future sea level projections using recalibrated models," says Dorthe Dahl-Jensen.</p>

    <p><img src="https://www.spicyweb.dev/images/jared-white.jpg" alt=""> By <a href="https://www.spicyweb.dev/about">Jared White</a></p>
  </header>

<p>Before I give you my side of the story, I’d like to point you to <a href="https://remotesynthesis.com/blog/goodbye-jamstack/" target="_blank">Brian Rinaldi’s comprehensive take on the demise of Jamstack</a> (or as I still prefer to call it, JAMstack) for some much-needed context on what’s been going down. He asks “is Jamstack officially finished?” and this article is essentially my reply.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> the answer is <em>yes</em>.</p>

<p>As for the reason why, we must point our finger straight at <a href="https://netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>.</p>

<p>Listen, I get it. Running a successful and hopefully profitable hosting company with investors breathing down your neck is hard. I don’t begrudge them for having to pivot to enterprise cloud mumbo-jumbo in order to reel in the big bucks and justify their valuation.</p>

<p>But I can’t help but feel duped…like so much of the other “enshittification” we’ve been dealing with in tech over the last few years. <strong>The cycle repeats itself</strong>: we invest our hard-earned time and sometimes money to build on top of friendly, seemingly benign platforms—only to see those platforms wriggle out from under us and morph into something entirely different (and for our purposes, much worse).</p>

<p>Gather around folks, and listen to my story of my first experience with the JAMstack. I’ll also explain why prior to this news I’d already moved on from the it and from Netlify, and what instead I believe the web dev industry should be heading towards as a “default” stack.</p>

<h2 id="the-year-was-2015">The Year Was 2015 <a href="#the-year-was-2015">#</a></h2>

<p>I had just come off a lengthy stint trying to build and promote a paid, tablet-first CMS. With a failed startup behind me, as well as a number of WordPress sites I simply <em>hated</em> to administer because they were so buggy and insecure and expensive, I was getting desperate. Due to my experience as a Ruby on Rails developer, I even tried reaching for some Rails-based CMSes, but finding a slam-dunk improvement over WordPress was far from straightforward.</p>

<p><strong>And then I stumbled upon Jekyll.</strong> 😍</p>

<p>To this day, I have no clue why it had initially taken me so long to discover Jekyll. Jekyll was integrated into GitHub (powering their Pages product) and was built with Ruby! I do remember hearing more and more about “static site generators” (aka SSGs) as I was winding down production of my own CMS, and I filed that thought away as a possible way to salvage some of the work I’d done.</p>

<p>Eventually I <em>finally</em> gave Jekyll a real try, and I was floored. Here was an amazing developer-friendly tool where I could just to take a bunch of simple HTML / Markdown, CSS, JavaScript, and image files, run a single command, and BOOM: get a website trivially easy to deploy anywhere. I even grokked the Liquid template syntax without issue, because I was already familiar with both Shopify and my own CMS which had used Liquid.</p>

<p>The only real head-scratcher was the content authoring side of the equation—I couldn’t expect my clients to learn how to input Markdown into GitHub—but with my experience having already built authoring interfaces, I figured it wouldn’t be hard to put together a simple Rails editor app that could work with Markdown and GitHub under the hood.</p>

<p>I dogfooded Jekyll first for my own personal website at <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/" target="_blank">jaredwhite.com</a>, relaunching it in February 2016. (It’s since been resigned many times and is now built with <a href="https://www.bridgetownrb.com/" target="_blank">Bridgetown</a> instead…but it remains a static site!) From there, I worked on a variety of projects for myself and for clients. To this very day, some of those sites are still on the web humming along without issue (<a href="https://www.sengoidelc.com/" target="_blank">here’s one of my favorites</a>) because, hey, <em>static sites are awesome!</em></p>

<h2 id="along-came-aerobatic-netlify">Along Came <del>Aerobatic</del> Netlify <a href="#along-came-aerobatic-netlify">#</a></h2>

<p>When I first got into this brand-new world of modern SSGs, the gold standard for hosting Ruby-powered web applications was Heroku. I was quite familiar with Heroku and had used it on a number of projects. But Heroku had nothing to offer me when it came to SSGs. Heroku was engineered around a model of dynamic web servers and databases, not build-once-and-cache-on-a-CDN-forever deployments.</p>

<p>I suppose I could have just used GitHub Pages, but at that time I was primarily using Bitbucket for hosting my projects and those of my clients. So it was perfect timing that, right when I needed to figure this all out, along came <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151029053713/http://www.aerobatic.com:80/blog/websites-for-bitbucket-powered-by-aerobatic.html" target="_blank">Aerobatic</a>.</p>

<p>Aerobatic was basically Heroku but for static sites hosted on Bitbucket (it was literally an add-on for that platform). <strong>Perfect!</strong> I could easily get that “push via Git and automatically deploy” workflow going with no other setup required. And the deployed sites were fast, secure, and cheap as hell to operate indefinitely.</p>

<p>For my client’s content editors, I usually just spun up a cheap VPS on Digital Ocean. They didn’t need to be high-powered at all, because those servers weren’t promoted to the public or accessed by more than one person really. And because all the content was stored in a Git repo, I didn’t even need to wrestle with a database!</p>

<p><strong>However, my love affair with Aerobatic didn’t last long. Because another shiny offering soon emerged: Netlify.</strong></p>

<p>The best way I can describe Netlify when I first started using it is “like Aerobatic…except better”. I’d encountered a few technical difficulties getting Aerobatic sites up and running, and Netlify was a noticeable  improvement. Builds were fast, deploys were rock-solid, and <em>It. Just. Worked.</em> Plus it supported both GitHub &amp; Bitbucket, so either way I was golden. I forget when they added the Forms feature, but it was pretty early on and that also proved a huge advantage.</p>

<p>One issue many of us encountered when trying to market these amazing new “static site” to potential customers was the term <em>static</em>. Calling a website “static” for many people implied a site which rarely changed and couldn’t accommodate any dynamic, interactive functionality. <em>Boring.</em> For instance, surely you couldn’t run your e-commerce site as a “static” site because e-commerce is anything but static!</p>

<p>Enter <strong>JAMstack</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-jamstack-is-here-to-solve-all-our-problems-right">The JAMstack is Here to Solve All Our Problems (Right?) <a href="#the-jamstack-is-here-to-solve-all-our-problems-right">#</a></h2>

<p>Netlify’s marketing sleight of hand in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315085227/https://jamstack.org/" target="_blank">inventing and promoting the JAMstack</a> was sheer brilliance. Instead of calling these builds “static sites” and these tools “static site generators”, we could say we’re building JAMstack sites (to compete with LAMPstack sites I suppose) and using some hot new JAMstack frameworks. The JAM stood for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>APIs</li>
  <li>Markup</li>
</ul>

<p>And lest anyone get confused (because as we’ll soon discover EVERYONE eventually got very confused), the JavaScript of the J in JAM referred to <em>client-side JS</em>, not server-side. The whole point of JAMstack was that the tool building out the markup etc. could be written in anything, and just as importantly the <em>APIs used by the client-side JS could be written in anything</em>. After all, both Jekyll and Rails are Ruby-based tools, and I happily used both as part of my JAMstack deployments.￼</p>

<p>As time went on, a major appeal of the JAMstack was that it allowed a decoupling of the frontend from the backend, which is why Netlify and other hosts like it later on proved extremely popular with frontend developers. Ironically, in today’s world where SSR (server-side rendering) and progressive enhancement is now top of mind for many web developers, it’s positively <em>wild</em> to turn back the clock and realize that JAMstack architecture arose during the height of the <strong>SPA</strong> movement. You can even see it in all the marketing materials—your app “shell” could be statically deployed, and then your fancy-pants client-side app could take over and call APIs from all over the web. And a number of JAMstack sites were literally that. Disable JavaScript and what do you get? Maybe a simple header and footer if you’re lucky. <em>Everything else is blank.</em> <strong>Whoops!</strong></p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, that was never <em>my</em> JAMstack. I had intuitively understood that the exciting promise of JAM was in a sense the reverse acronym of MAJ: Markup, <em>then</em> APIs, <em>then</em> JavaScript. In other words, build as much as you can with static HTML (via templates, Markdown, etc.), <em>then</em> identify what you might need for some dynamic server interactions—which maybe you’d just write yourself as a Rails app or whatever—<em>then</em> write only the JavaScript you absolutely need to access those APIs (understanding that maybe certain dynamic pages would just get fetched directly from the server if need be).</p>

<p>In other words, <strong>progressive enhancement</strong>. 😂</p>

<p>But somehow that story got lost in the fray, and JAMstack eventually gave rise to a rebranded “Jamstack” with the major value prop being something rather entirely different: you could now build entire websites out of <em>JavaScript libraries</em> (aka React, or maybe Vue or Angular or Svelte) and <em>JavaScript frameworks</em> (aka Next.js, Gatsby, Nuxt, SvelteKit, etc.). And, whoa, look at this! You don’t need servers ever again! You can just write <em>serverless functions</em> to go along with your frontends! Fullstack, server-first web development is dead, long live frontend + serverless!</p>

<p>(Coinciding with this sea change, Jekyll began a long, slow, painful decline into irrelevance, due to the inexplicable failure of GitHub’s leadership to support its proper development and promotion as well as an unforgivable neglect of the Pages platform. It remains one of my greatest frustrations in 25+ years of web development…so much so that I forked Jekyll in 2020 and created <a href="https://www.bridgetownrb.com/" target="_blank">Bridgetown</a>. But I digress…)</p>

<p>Along with this “second generation” Jamstack mindset shift came <em>an order of magnitude</em> more build complexity. Instead of a straightforward CLI kicking off simple transformations to go from Markdown -&gt; HTML plus concatenate some (S)CSS files together or whatever, you’d get multi-minute long builds and GBs of <code>node_modules</code> and poorly-written tutorials on DEV.to about how to send emails from Gatsby functions and which distributed “web-scale” databases of the day are the coolest and crazy CLI tool churn and all sorts of other headaches. Things which used to take hours or days to accomplish in standard Rails or Laravel or Django apps—most of this stuff isn’t rocket science, folks—now took weeks or months! <em>Progress!</em> 🤪</p>

<p>This quick march of slapdash B.S. web technology under the guise of making our lives easier was <em>one hell of a whiplash</em>, and I really hadn’t seen it coming when I first entered this space. Instead of JAMstack saving us all from the horrors of WordPress, we were crushed under the weight of Jamstack! Janky SPAs, countless immature buggy frameworks, and NPM ecosystem insanity—along with the multi-headed hydra that is modern React.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.spicyweb.dev/the-great-gaslighting-of-the-js-age/">It got so bad I wrote about it.</a> (Warning: if you think <em>this</em> article has taken on a dour tone, avoid reading that spicy take! 🌶️)</p>

<h2 id="netlify-isnt-to-blameexcept-netlify-is-to-blame-">Netlify isn’t to blame…except Netlify is to blame 😬 <a href="#netlify-isnt-to-blameexcept-netlify-is-to-blame-">#</a></h2>

<p>We can’t put <em>all</em> the fault squarely on Netlify, in the sense that people mistakenly thought they needed to build their blogs with Gatsby and their business dashboards with Next.js because that’s what all the “techfluencers” and VC-backed tool vendors told them.</p>

<p>Yet I <strong>do</strong> blame Netlify, because <em>they’re the people who invented the term JAMstack!</em> Netlify proved more than happy to come along for the ride and oblige as one of the top hosting platforms of choice for this new ecosystem. They <em>could</em> have come out in favor of saner architectures and better support for languages other than JavaScript (believe me, I went around and around with them about their lack of interest in supporting Ruby-based server applications <strong>even as their own platform used Ruby under the hood!</strong>). They <em>could</em> have warned us of the dangers of complicated API spaghetti code and microservices. After all, why should Netlify care if your static site calls out to 20 different APIs or your own monolithic API you wrote in a battle-hardened, “boring” server framework? This bizarro-world focus on “serverless functions” and later “edge functions” never made a lick of sense to me (unless Netlify really thought they could somehow significantly profit off of function usage…again, a prospect which makes little sense to me).</p>

<p>Ultimately the failure of Jamstack to live up to the promise of its original JAMstack incarnation, and the industry’s manic pendulum swing into unmaintainable architectures and vendor lock-in, led me to abandon Netlify as a hosting platform of choice and look instead to more reasonable options. At this moment in time, that choice for me is <a href="https://www.render.com/" target="_blank">Render</a>. Render gives you the best of all worlds: deploy a static site to a CDN, deploy a server API written in any framework you want—even Rails!—deploy a Docker container…anything you need, <strong>BOOM</strong>, done. Want to use PostgreSQL? <em>Check.</em> Need Redis? <em>Check.</em> Would you like simultaneous deploys of all these services at once? <em>Check.</em></p>

<p>I have no business arrangement with Render, and I assure you this isn’t a sponsored post. I just really like their service. And if Render does become <em>enshittified</em> down the road, I’ll be super bummed and look for yet another alternative. (I sure hope that won’t become necessary!)</p>

<p>What saddens me is Netlify <em>could</em> have grown into a Render and meaningfully competed with Heroku—except they didn’t. They took a different road, and I would argue <strong>they failed</strong>. Hey, hindsight is 20/20…but honestly this was <em>so</em> easy to predict. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>

<p>I’m sad to see Jamstack die, but the thing is: <em>most</em> web applications deployed by most individuals and small teams only need modest server offerings and maybe a static site. Again, it’s not rocket science. Most projects never need to become “web scale” and most web architectural complexity is completely unnecessary. You can spin up a Node.js API with Fastify, or a Ruby Roda API, or, heck, some PHP, stick it on a decent cloud server somewhere, and <em>that’s totally fine</em>. Boring technology is <strong>great</strong>. And servers are in fact totally awesome, as more and more developers are thankfully coming to discover (again).</p>

<h2 id="the-legacy-of-netlify">The Legacy of Netlify <a href="#the-legacy-of-netlify">#</a></h2>

<p>What Netlify gave us originally was a vision of how to deploy HTML-first websites easily via git commits and pushes, just like Heroku had done for dynamic applications. All we need now is a modern Netlify/Heroku mashup that’s cheap, stable, and doesn’t need to reinvent the damn wheel every year.</p>

<p>What do we call this, now that Jamstack is dead? I don’t know.</p>

<p><strong>I vote for KISSstack. (Keep It Simple, Silly.)</strong> 😋</p>

<p>But seriously, I think it’s vitally important to remember that simple websites and more complex web applications all sit on a spectrum, and a good web host will be able to identify your individual needs and provision builds and runtimes accordingly—no matter what the particular service offerings might be. (<a href="https://www.spicyweb.dev/web-app-and-web-site-should-be-friends/">I wrote about this too.</a>)</p>

<p>From my vantage point, the <em>only</em> goal I care about is to make building &amp; deploying sites dramatically easier for individuals and small teams. (<a href="https://imgflip.com/memetemplate/117794993/I-dont-think-about-you-at-all-Mad-Men" target="_blank">Sorry Big Co. Enterprises, I don’t think about you at all.</a>) And while it’s a real shame that Netlify is no longer in a position to usher in this future for us, I’m optimistic we’ll see <a href="https://www.render.com/" target="_blank">Render</a>, <a href="https://fly.io/" target="_blank">Fly.io</a>, and other companies down the road pick up the slack.</p>

<p><strong>Somebody</strong> has to.￼</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  
 <p>These two links have brought to mind an issue I’ve been thinking a lot about.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://shorts.stackingthebricks.com/the-boom-times-are-over/">​"The boom times are over.“​</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.zachleat.com/web/cloudcannon/">​"Eleventy and CloudCannon: New Best Friends—zachleat.com"​</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first, Amy Hoy’s post, points out that the tech bubble—the one that has been kept inflated over the past sixteen years with low interest rates, non-existent antitrust regulation, and a legal environment for tech that, in the US at least, has effectively been a free-for-all—is now over. The incestuous startup ecosystem that largely consisted of over-funded bullshit companies buying services from each other is done. The industry’s ability to command eye-watering exits–IPOs and acquisitions—for money-losing companies with no realistic path to profitability, has been limited by increased scrutiny from authorities on both sides of the Atlantic and by increased scepticism about the promise that tech will eventually deliver magical profits.</p>
<p>The tide is going out and people are slowly realising that the only companies that make <em>real</em> money in tech are the monopolists or quasi-monopolists. A small group of multinational corporations have each locked down their user base—control every aspect of their segment of the market—and are now abusing that position to extract revenue at the expense of other companies in tech and the economy in general.</p>
<p>In the second link Zach Leatherman writes about some of the changes that are taking place in <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/"><em>Eleventy</em></a>, the open source project he runs. Development on the project used to be funded by Netlify, but they seem to be dialling down their investment in open source, so Zach was forced to reassess the path that the project was on and find new ways of keeping it sustainable.</p>
<p>Eleventy is a nicely structured piece of software that I’ve used in a few projects myself, so I’m glad to see the partnership between it and CloudCannon. The two projects <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/blog/cloudcannon-the-official-cms-partner-of-eleventy/">look very complementary</a>.</p>
<p>They also plan to simplify the project and keep it focused on what it does well, and this touches on something I’ve been thinking about for a few weeks, ever since I read a conversation on Mastodon between Zach and Jim Nielsen on Jim’s blog post <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/language-level-toll-roads/">“Language-Level Toll Roads”</a>. And that blog post makes a bunch of good points (emphasis original):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think maybe what I’m trying to put my finger on is this contrast between open source foundations with proprietary features <em>on top</em>, vs. open source foundations with proprietary features <em>built-in</em> — and the tension and competition that will take place between the two.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was trying to figure out ways of articulating the tension the relationship between free/libre/open source software (FLOSS) and the economic environment it exists in when I realised that FLOSS <em>created</em> the environment. Modern tech only exists because of free and open source software.</p>
<p>Back in the ancient days—in the before times when I first made websites—the tech world was predominantly closed source. The “dot” in dot-com were closed source servers such as those by Sun Microsystems (years before they caught the open source bug). Browsers were closed. Operating systems were closed—for the most part. The tools were largely closed. Even many of the popular programming languages used, such as ColdFusion or Java, were closed. For most users, when they visited a website, the entire stack was end-to-end closed. Database, server, browser, and operating system.</p>
<p>That took a long time to change, but now the core computing experience—browsing the web—is predominantly based on open source:</p>
<ul>
<li>Server operating system</li>
<li>Database</li>
<li>Server language</li>
<li>Server framework</li>
<li>Client operating system (Android, even Apple’s OSes have substantial OSS components)</li>
<li>Client side language</li>
<li>Client side framework</li>
<li>Browser</li>
</ul>
<p>Even in the native app domain, most of the frameworks people use to create cross-platform apps are open source.</p>
<p><em>A majority of the value created by modern software ultimately comes from free and open source software.</em></p>
<p>From this perspective most VC investments aren’t about <em>creating value</em> but about strip-mining FLOSS projects and communities. The scale is for <em>extraction</em>.</p>
<p>The tension is that these investors don’t just want to capture this value for themselves, they want to extract even more value from the communities surrounding the projects.</p>
<p>That’s why popular frameworks often start to spawn what Jim described as <em>built-in</em> proprietary features. One example is the key-value service that is being baked into the otherwise excellent Deno project. Another, more subtle example, comes from Eleventy itself: <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/edge/"><em>Eleventy Edge</em></a>.</p>
<p>There isn’t anything <em>inherently</em> proprietary about Eleventy Edge. In theory, there are a few “edge computing” services that should be able to support it, but in practice, the company that employed the project lead at the time and the only company actively funding the feature, is going to be the only one whose service is reliably supported.</p>
<p>This is the reason why I’m excited about the partnership between Eleventy and CloudCannon and the project’s refocusing. It isn’t that the project will get simpler to use (though I’d be happy if it does) but the complementary nature of the collaboration creates a dynamic where every part of the project benefits the community as a whole, in a non-extractive way.</p>
<p>The extractive dynamic between a tech company and financially dependent open source projects is incredibly common and few handle it as well as Zach seems to have, both during his time at Netlify, and with the decision now to rejig things. Netlify’s dominance over the project could have been lethal—making it incapable of surviving without Netlify’s financial support.</p>
<p>The transition that’s taking place is because with less money floating around, the tech industry is retrenching and in many cases that means they’re either not funding FLOSS any more or that they’re ramping up their attempts to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/23/red_hat_centos_move/">extract value from the community.</a> Companies invest less in FLOSS and want to take more of the value created.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the increased popularity of language models in software development, themselves a blatant strip-mining of FLOSS code, likely has the effect of deflating the size of the communities themselves. Why use an open source project when you can get a language model that’s trained on that project to rehash it and inject it into your code? Why give somebody credit for the lines of code you’ve adapted for your own project when you can get a language model to whitewash it and let you claim it as your own?</p>
<p>To me, it feels a bit like the relationship between the industry and FLOSS communities has switched from being somewhat productive and occasionally abusive to being outright <em>looting</em>.</p>
<p>Finding partnerships that are genuinely mutually beneficial, which is something I hope Eleventy has managed, is one path out of this. Another is for those working in tech to continue to try and find ways of making community-supported projects more sustainable.</p>
<p>But I’m worried that many free and open source projects, small and large, are about to have a pretty hard time, and with them their communities.</p>
<p>I don’t really know how best to mitigate that, and I’m kind of hoping that my sense of unease is just unfounded.</p>

      <p>As the social media landscape ebbs and flows, the team at BBC Research &amp; Development are researching social technologies and exploring possibilities for the BBC. One part of our work is to establish a BBC presence in the distributed collection of social networks known as the Fediverse, a collection of social media applications all linked together by common protocols. The most common software used in this area is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-63534240">Mastodon</a>, a Twitter-like social networking service with around 2 million active monthly users. We are now running an experimental BBC Mastodon server at <a href="https://social.bbc/">https://social.bbc</a> where you can follow some of the BBC’s social media accounts, including BBC R&amp;D, Radio 4 and 5 Live. We hope to be able to add more accounts from other areas of the BBC at some point.</p>

<h2>Mastodon and the Fediverse</h2>
<p>Mastodon is a “federated” social network. Federated social networks aren’t controlled by one organisation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_social_network">federation means that anyone can run a server and host users</a> and each server can offer its own moderation and membership rules, but all the servers can connect to each other. This model is more like email where you can email anyone, but as an individual, you choose which email provider you want to use.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/sites/50335ff370b5c262af000004/assets/64c7859d06d63e5047000311/fediverse-overview-16x9.png" alt="An overview illustration titled 'The Many Branches of the Fediverse' - this is a cartoon illustration of a tree, with each of the branches or parts of the tree populated by online services that work in a federated manner. There is a part of the tree for Social Networking containing services like Mastodon, one of the branches is for multimedia and contains services like Peer Tube and Pixelfed, and for writing services like WordPress and Drupal. The roots of the tree contain the ActivityPub protocol, showing that these services are all flowing and are enabled by this."></p>
<p>Federated social networks, or <a href="https://fediverse.info/">the Fediverse</a>, offer a model for future development that aligns with our own work to support a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/public-service-internet">public service internet</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/bbc-box-personal-data-management-privacy">our previous work</a> on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2022-10-social-tv-and-personal-data">decentralised data</a>. The principles of the Fediverse, with an emphasis on local control, quality content, and social value, are far more aligned with our public purposes than those of avowedly commercial networks like Threads or Twitter. Other public service and non-profit organisations already have a presence there, from <a href="https://social.overheid.nl/@avhuffelen/110700825255524685">the Dutch government</a> to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@wikimediafoundation">Wikimedia</a> to <a href="https://social.network.europa.eu/explore">the EU</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://social.bbc/">We've set up a Mastodon server for the BBC to publish content in the Fediverse</a>. Initially, our server hosts this selection of BBC social media accounts, where we’ll be publishing content just like we do on other social platforms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://social.bbc/@BBCRD" rel="me">@BBCRD@social.bbc</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://social.bbc/@BBC5Live" rel="me">@BBC5Live@social.bbc</a></strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://social.bbc/@BBC_News_Labs" rel="me">@BBC_News_Labs@social.bbc</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike most Mastodon servers where you can sign up for a personal account, we're only using this instance to host BBC accounts; it’s a place for us to publish in the Fediverse. If you have a Mastodon (or other ActivityPub) account from another server, then you can easily follow our accounts.</p>
<p>We're using social.bbc as the domain, so you can be sure <a href="https://www.icann.org/en/registry-agreements/details/bbc">these accounts are genuinely from the BBC</a>. And by linking to and from the BBC’s website, <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/verification">we have verified our identity on Mastodon</a>.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>As a large, high profile, public service organisation, we've had to work through a fair number of issues to get this far and we’ve had advice and support from several teams across the BBC.</p>
<p>Explaining the federated model can be a challenge as people are much more familiar with the centralised model of ownership. We’ve had to answer questions like “Are we running our own social network?” (well, we’re kind of hosting a small section of a social network) and “Are we hosting a user’s content?” (well, we don’t allow users to create accounts or post from our server, but they can reply to our posts from their own servers, and then their posts will appear next to ours and then they might be stored on our server and it all gets quite complicated).</p>
<p>The latter question leads on to moderation. Although we will only host BBC accounts, there will be replies from other people to our posts. What is our responsibility for moderation here? When the BBC hosts comments on our own website, as on some of our news and sports stories, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/editorialguidelines/guidelines/competitions-votes-interactivity/guidelines#commentandmoderation">we moderate these according to our guidelines</a>. Where we post on third-party social media platforms we will keep an eye on any replies and take appropriate action where necessary (such as reporting a comment to the third-party) but we also expect the third-party to have some centralised moderation in place. Because it is a decentralised service, there is no central Mastodon moderation team that we can point to, instead all Mastodon servers are responsible for their own moderation. Mastodon allows the administrators to add a content warning, remove posts, or even block all posts from another server, and many instances are effective in moderating troublesome content from their users. We think this is an acceptable risk and will apply <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/terms/what-are-the-rules-for-commenting/">the BBC’s social media moderation rules to any replies to our posts where we can</a>.</p>
<p>You might be able to see from the above why we chose to make this a BBC-only server and not host user accounts.</p>
<h2>An experiment</h2>
<p>This is an experiment - we will run it for 6 months and then decide whether and how to continue.</p>
<p>We aim to learn how much value it has provided and how much work and cost is involved. Does it reach enough people for the effort we need to put in? Are there risks or benefits from the federated model, with no centralised rules or moderation and no filtering or sorting algorithms? We're learning as we go, and we'll write about what we discover in the hope that it might be useful for others. The BBC will continue its other social media activity in the usual places.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, could we move beyond Mastodon to other ActivityPub applications for publishing content? And would this provide us with some insulation from the risks that might be created as other social media platforms continue to change and evolve? And will large, planet-scale social media platforms persist or are they gradually disappearing? What are the alternatives and what will we have in 10 years time?</p>
<p>If you have a Mastodon account already, then please follow us -&nbsp;<a href="https://social.bbc/@BBCRD">https://social.bbc/@BBCRD</a>&nbsp;- and let us know what you think. If you don’t, then you can <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">learn more about joining Mastodon</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-143">https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-143</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36943495">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Richard Heart (aka Richard Schueler) and three unincorporated entities that he controls, Hex, PulseChain, and PulseX, with conducting unregistered offerings of crypto asset securities that raised more than $1 billion in crypto assets from investors. The SEC also charged Heart and PulseChain with fraud for misappropriating at least $12 million of offering proceeds to purchase luxury goods including sports cars, watches, and a 555-carat black diamond known as ‘The Enigma’ – reportedly the largest black diamond in the world.</p>

<p>According to the SEC’s complaint, Heart began marketing Hex in 2018, claiming it was the first high-yield “blockchain certificate of deposit,” and began promoting Hex tokens as an investment designed to make people “rich.” From at least December 2019 through November 2020, Heart and Hex allegedly offered and sold Hex tokens in an unregistered offering, collecting more than 2.3 million Ethereum (ETH), including through so-called “recycling” transactions that enabled Heart to surreptitiously gain control of more Hex tokens. The complaint also alleges that, between at least July 2021 and March 2022, Heart orchestrated two additional unregistered crypto asset security offerings that each raised hundreds of millions of dollars more in crypto assets. As alleged, those funds were intended to support development of a supposed crypto asset network, PulseChain, and a claimed crypto asset trading platform, PulseX, through the offerings of their native tokens, respectively, PLS and PLSX. Heart also allegedly designed and marketed a so-called “staking” feature for Hex tokens, which he claimed would deliver returns as high as 38 percent. The complaint further alleges that Heart attempted to evade securities laws by calling on investors to “sacrifice” (instead of “invest”) their crypto assets in exchange for PLS and PLSX tokens.</p>

<p>“Heart called on investors to buy crypto asset securities in offerings that he failed to register. He then defrauded those investors by spending some of their crypto assets on exorbitant luxury goods,” said Eric Werner, Director of the Fort Worth Regional Office. “This action seeks to protect the investing public and hold Heart accountable for his actions.”</p>

<p>The SEC’s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleges that Heart, Hex, PulseChain, and PulseX violated the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint also alleges that Heart and PulseChain violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties, and other equitable relief.</p>

<p>The SEC’s continuing investigation is being conducted by Jaime Marinaro and Derek Kleinmann of the Fort Worth Regional Office, with assistance from Jamie Haussecker. The investigation is supervised by Sarah S. Mallett and Eric Werner of the Fort Worth Regional Office and by Jorge G. Tenreiro and David Hirsch of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. The litigation will be conducted by Matthew J. Gulde and supervised by B. David Fraser.</p>

      Yellow Corp., a 99-year-old trucking company that was once a dominant player in its field, halted operations Sunday and will lay off all 30,000 of its workers.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_9BB5C57B-A8BE-5DB2-8D35-A8CCF373596E@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph">
      The unionized company has been in a battle with the Teamsters union, which represents about 22,000 drivers and dock workers at the company. Just a week ago the union canceled a threatened strike that had been prompted by the company failing to contribute to its pension and health insurance plans. The union granted the company an extra month to make the required payments. 
  </p>

      But by midweek last week, the company had stopped picking up freight from its customers and was making deliveries only of freight already in its system, according to both the union and Satish Jindel, a trucking industry consultant.
  </p>

      While the union agreed not to go on strike against Yellow, it could not reach an agreement on a new contract with the trucking company, according to a memo sent to local unions Thursday by the Teamsters’ negotiating committee. The union said early Monday that it had been notified of the shutdown.

      “Today’s news is unfortunate but not surprising. Yellow has historically proven that it could not manage itself despite billions of dollars in worker concessions and hundreds of millions in bailout funding from the federal government. This is a sad day for workers and the American freight industry,” said Teamsters President Sean O’Brien in a statement.

      Company officials did not respond to numerous requests for comment Sunday and Monday.

      While the company is based in Nashville, Tennessee, it is a national company with terminals and employees spread between more than 300 terminals nationwide.<strong> </strong>Experts in the field said it was primarily an unaffordable amount of debt, more than the cost of the union contract, that did in Yellow.

      “The Teamsters had made a series of painful concessions that brought them close to wage parity with nonunion carriers,” said Tom Nightingale, CEO of AFS Logistics, a third-party logistics firm that places about $11 billion worth of freight annually with different trucking companies on behalf of shippers. He said the company began taking on significant amount of debt 20 years ago in order to acquire other trucking companies.

      “Now their debt service is just enormous,” he said, pointing to $1.5 billion in debt on its books.

      There are two other national competitors in Yellow’s segment of the trucking market which are also unionized, ABF Freight and TForce. Both were far more profitable in recent years than Yellow, which posted only a narrow operating profit in 2021 and 2022 and a $9.3 million operating loss in the first quarter.
  </p>

      There were reports last week that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2023/07/27/business/yellow-corp-bankruptcy/index.html" target="_blank">a bankruptcy filing</a> would come by July 31, although the company said last week only that it continued to be in talks with the Teamsters and that it was considering all of its options. The Teamsters said Monday the company is filing for bankruptcy.
  </p>

      The closing is bad news not only for its employees and its customers, who generally used Yellow because it offered some of the cheapest rates in the trucking sector, but also for US taxpayers. The company received a $700 million loan from the federal government in 2020, a loan that resulted in taxpayers holding 30% of its outstanding stock. And the company still owed the Treasury department more than $700 million according to its most recently quarterly report, nearly half of the long-term debt on its books.

      Yellow’s stock lost 82% of its  value between the time of that loan and Thursday close after reports of the bankruptcy plans, closing at only 57 cents a share. It bumped up 14 cents a share on Friday, but still remained a so-called penny stock.

      The company had received that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/01/business/yrc-federal-loan/index.html" target="_blank">loan</a> during the pandemic, despite the fact that at the time it was facing charges of defrauding the government by overbilling on shipments of items for the US military. The company eventually settled the dispute without admitting wrongdoing but was forced to pay a $6.85 million fine. 
  </p>

      Yellow handles pallet-sized shipments of freight, moving shipments from numerous customers in the same truck, a segment of the trucking industry known as less-than-truckload, or LTL. The company had been claiming as recently as June that it was the nation’s third largest LTL carrier.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_1B78F2A4-1D66-BA28-1DAE-A8DE89BBDBBF@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph">
      But the company handled only about 7% of the nation’s 720,000 daily LTL shipments last year, said Jindel. He said there is about 8% to 10% excess capacity in the LTL sector right now, so the closure of Yellow shouldn’t cause a significant disruption in supply chains. But he said it will cause higher rates for shippers who depend on LTL carriers, since it was the excess capacity that sent prices lower.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_12794F88-8F86-6E14-7AFA-A8DEC7AD60D8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph">
      Higher prices will hit Yellow customers, Jindel said.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_6699ED73-D9B0-E40B-84FD-A8DEC7AD3FC7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph">
      “The reason they were using Yellow was because they were cheap,” he said. “They’re finding out that price was below the cost of supporting a good operation.”
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_B6AF5876-DE05-F785-3DA7-AC9961E5BA40@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph">
      While the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2023/07/27/economy/second-quarter-gdp/index.html" target="_blank">US economy has remained strong</a>, spending by consumers has been shifting in recent years from the goods they were buying in 2020 and early 2021 when they were still stuck close to home due to the pandemic, to services, such as plane tickets and other experiences that don’t need to move by truck. Nightingale said industrywide LTL shipments fell 17% between 2021 and 2022, and another 5% in the first quarter compared to the first quarter a year earlier.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_0C14840F-AB0C-2E09-5EDA-AC9BDA13D8F0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph">
      He said that while Yellow could be profitable when demand for trucking was strong, it couldn’t get by in the face of the slowdown in freight, and the drop in trucking rates that went with it. Shippers worried about Yellow’s future started shifting to other carriers, as its shipments fell 13% in the first quarter compared a year earlier.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_0AFDBC24-6FFE-C15D-633D-ACA2DE7053F4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph">
      “It’s what Warren Buffett says, when the tide goes out you discover who’s been swimming naked,” Nightingale said.
  </p>

  

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_73AF6B10-B721-2001-48F0-ABBD256E2EFF@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph">
      When the trucking industry was deregulated nearly 40 years ago, the segment of the industry that handled full trailers of cargo, known as truckload, soon was dominated by non-union trucking companies. The only thing low-cost competitors needed to enter that segment of the industry was a truck.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_61193841-BD3A-3855-7149-ABBD275838A2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph">
      But the LTL segment requires a network of terminals to sort incoming and outgoing freight. That limited, but did not prevent, the entry of low-cost competitors. So unionized carriers such as Yellow continued to be major players, even as non-union rivals grew.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_6E4FF6E9-A2B2-12CE-9E77-ABBD275A8C60@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph">
      Eventually non-union carriers came to dominate the LTL segment as well. By early in this century, many of the remaining unionized LTL carriers, including Yellow and rivals such as Roadway Express, New Penn and Holland, merged to survive.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_6C9E526F-9A52-6BE3-597F-ABBD275BB965@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph">
      Yellow, Roadway and a third company known as CF or Consolidated Freightways had once been known as the Big Three of the trucking industry. CF went out of business in 2002. And with Yellow Corp. closing, the final two parts of the Big Three are now out of business as well.

<p>As FreeBSD marks three decades of success, we can thank open source freedom, a strong culture, a shared leadership model, modern development practices, and robust code that continues to evolve.</p>



<p>FreeBSD’s 30th birthday presents an opportunity to look back and examine why&nbsp;this open source operating system&nbsp;has not only endured, but thrived across many organizations and use cases for so long. While open source projects are born out of different circumstances, FreeBSD grew from a mold of its own. The path the project took has everything to do with its longevity and why, 30 years after FreeBSD launched, you’ll find FreeBSD code helping to power everything from your content on Netflix to your games on PlayStation.</p>

<h2 id="bsd-before-the-free">BSD (before the Free)</h2>



<p>Initially released in 1993, FreeBSD is rooted in the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) code base that had been under development since the 1970s. The pioneering BSD project introduced the socket networking interface, the first implementation of TCP/IP, file systems including VFS, FFS, and NFS, the mmap memory model, and more. While BSD was&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;open source, its licensed code still received many contributions from academic and industry users.</p>



<p>Most of BSD was made available as open source software with the 4.4BSD-Lite distribution, providing the basis for FreeBSD. The foundational nature of its technology has been a significant factor in its success ever since.</p>







<p>To manage leadership succession and avoid risks associated with the singular-leader structure common to many other open source projects, the founders of the FreeBSD project set up the FreeBSD Core Team, a group of leaders responsible for the project’s direction and controlling committer privileges. While the founders initially assigned themselves as these leaders, in 2000 the nine seats on the Core Team became elected positions. Enabling committers to vote for FreeBSD’s leadership and rise to leadership roles themselves has kept the project particularly robust and capable of evolution.</p>



<h2 id="modern-remote-development">Modern remote development</h2>



<p>FreeBSD has leveraged source code control, bug reporting, and other tools that could enable remote development from its beginning. In an era when open source project distributions were most often maintained by a single individual who personally added all code contributions, the novel advantages of FreeBSD’s strategy have since come to define modern practices. This freedom to accelerate development beyond standard limitations meant rapidly incorporating code—including valuable capabilities drawn from NetBSD and OpenBSD.</p>




<h2 id="a-discerning-approach-to-hardware">A discerning approach to hardware</h2>



<p>The FreeBSD project decided from the start to select recommended hardware and offer diligent, targeted support. As a result, FreeBSD has consistently found itself ahead of the curve when it comes to reliability and performance metrics. That distinction is why it’s been such an enduringly popular choice for companies from the dial-up age through to modern web server providers.</p>



<h2 id="stellar-communication-documentation-support-and-culture">Stellar communication, documentation, support, and culture</h2>



<p>With FreeBSD enabling remote development and global contributions, the project was particularly strategic about the mailing lists it developed to keep work and design discussions organized and efficient. Because of that, FreeBSD quickly achieved thoughtful communications management with monitoring and moderation to keep discussions civil (yes, civility!) and on topic, without limiting freedom of expression and while serving developers from diverse cultures.</p>



<p>FreeBSD has also excelled at maintaining valuable software documentation from its beginning, starting by recruiting contributors with a focus on documentation, and asking developers to participate in making sure that documentation is accurate and complete. Toward this goal, FreeBSD specifically introduced a documentation committer group with the same privileges as code committers. The project also supports a multi-language documentation framework, making FreeBSD knowledge more approachable to more developers worldwide.</p>



<p>Culture is as important as technology in open source, and FreeBSD has a welcoming and inclusive one that extends the same voting rights (and an equal voice in the community) to all committers. The thriving&nbsp;FreeBSD Foundation—which was one of the industry’s first—offers a deep set of project support services as well.</p>



<h2 id="valuable-ports">Valuable ports</h2>



<p>FreeBSD’s initial release included numerous contributed utilities and libraries, and these have only expanded into the vast FreeBSD ports collection available today. This collection offers powerful and well-supported access to advanced open source technologies on top of FreeBSD. Once again, FreeBSD was an early&nbsp;leader. FreeBSD’s package management tool, pkg, has had regular improvements over the years. Poudriere, a FreeBSD package creation and testing utility, is a great tool that leverages jails, a major strength of FreeBSD, to allow developers to reproducibly test port changes and reliably build our 30,000+ ports. And, finally, all of the ports are available in binary form to make it easier for&nbsp;the user to install applications by using the pkg command.</p>



<h2 id="last-but-never-least-in-open-source-the-licensing">Last but never least in open source… the licensing</h2>



<p>Perhaps the most significant contributor to FreeBSD’s 30 years of success is its open source Berkeley license. The Berkeley license doesn’t require organizations to share source code changes with others, whereas Linux does. Companies that must place code representing proprietary intellectual property into their products need that licensing freedom—such as those in the appliance and embedded OS market. That open source freedom, paired with strong leadership, a strong culture, and robust code that continues to evolve, is why FreeBSD is now celebrating a happy 30th birthday.</p>



<h2 id="looking-ahead-to-the-next-30-years">Looking ahead to the next 30 years</h2>



<p>FreeBSD’s 30th anniversary provides a reminder that durable success doesn’t happen by accident. Reviewing how our community tackled the massive technical changes and challenges that occurred during this period also gives insights into what we must do to ensure we can celebrate similar milestones in the decades to come. By providing the best platform for rapid experimentation and development of new technologies, coupled with a reliable foundation for commercialization and wide adoption, we expect to see FreeBSD continue to thrive. We invite and encourage you to be a part of the next 30 years.</p>

"They come off as real amateurs," says Michael Norman, a theorist at Argonne National Laboratory. "They don't know much about superconductivity and the way they've presented some of the data is fishy." On the other hand, he says, researchers at Argonne and elsewhere are already trying to replicate the experiment. "People here are taking it seriously and trying to grow this stuff."

			(DeepL Translate excerpt from article linked)<br>
On the recent people hotly debated "if really immediately can get the Nobel Prize 'South Korea room temperature superconducting materials LK-99 paper'", July 28, Nanjing University, professor of physics Wen Haihu interviewed to the surging science and technology, said. "It's really buzzing, but it's not surprising because this thing is important." "Most of the (buzz) people are not doing superconductivity." "We carefully analysed their data, and from three aspects - resistance, magnetisation and so-called magnetic levitation - none of them are sufficient to show that it is a superconducting phenomenon (material)." "We judge that (its so-called superconductivity) is most likely an illusion."<p>

As for repeating the experiment, Wen Haihu said, "In fact, we didn't even want to do it because we judged that it didn't look like superconductivity, and then we also sent one of our classmates to work on it. Many groups internationally are repeating it. With our experience, (the data published in the current paper) is not enough to show that it is superconducting."

They conducted a total of 8 preliminary replication tests, and conducted XRD structure analysis on them, the results are consistent with the papers' findings, including the samples' appearances. However we cannot directly verify whether it is room-temp sc yet. The graphs of the tests are as follows: Magnetically measuring the magnetic field 10 Oe ZFC+FC

At the bare minimum, it's a novel substance with novel properties, so still probably Noble material.<p>

Practically, it's still superconducting even if it's only superconducting in microscopic regions. That's the kind of thing that could be used in high-end computing or precision instrumentation, provided the microscopic superconducting effect forms in a predictable, regular manner. </p><p>

Long-term, this is new ground even if it's not something immediately world-changing. Expect lots of research from everyone from governments to big universities to random garage hobbyists.</p></div>

Every single reputable lab so far has failed to replicate the results of the study as far as I can tell.   </p><p>

The idea that only trace amounts of the material is a superconductor is speculation at this point as far as I understand.  </p><p>

My estimation that this is anything news worthy is drastically falling.   </p><p>

            <pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2023 13:50:15 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/31/aws_says_ipv4_addresses_cost/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/31/aws_says_ipv4_addresses_cost/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36942424">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Cloud giant AWS will start charging customers for public IPv4 addresses from next year, claiming it is forced to do this because of the increasing scarcity of these and to encourage the use of IPv6 instead.</p>
<p>It is now four years since we <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/11/25/ipv4_addresses_gone/">officially ran out</a> of IPv4 ranges to allocate, and since then, those wanting a new public IPv4 address have had to rely on address ranges being recovered, either from from organizations that close down or those that return addresses they no longer require as they migrate to IPv6.</p>
<p>If Amazon's cloud division is to be believed, the difficulty in obtaining public IPv4 addresses has seen the cost of acquiring a single address rise by more than 300 percent over the past five years, and as we all know, the business is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/28/cloud_slowdown_hits_amazon_as/">a little short of cash at the moment</a>, so is having to pass these costs on to users.</p>

    

<p>"This change reflects our own costs and is also intended to encourage you to be a bit more frugal with your use of public IPv4 addresses and to think about accelerating your adoption of IPv6 as a modernization and conservation measure," writes AWS Chief Evangelist Jeff Barr, on the company <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-public-ipv4-address-charge-public-ip-insights/">news blog</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>The update will come into effect on February 1, 2024, when AWS customers will see a charge of $0.005 (half a cent) per IP address per hour for all public IPv4 addresses. These charges will apparently apply whether the address is attached to a service or not, and like many AWS charges, appear inconsequential at first glance but can mount up over time if a customer is using many of them.</p>
<p>These charges will apply to all AWS services including EC2, Relational Database Service (RDS) database instances, Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) nodes, and will apply across all AWS regions, the company said.</p>

        

<p>However, customers will not be charged for IP addresses that they own and bring to AWS using Amazon's BYOIP feature. AWS offers a free tier for EC2, and this will include 750 hours of public IPv4 address usage per month for the first 12 months, starting from the same date the charges do.</p>
<p>To try and help customers get a handle on how this might affect their AWS bill, the company said it is adding information on public IPv4 addresses to the AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR). It also unveiled a new feature of Amazon VPC IP Address Management (IPAM) called <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/view-public-ip-insights.html">Public IP Insights</a>, which is intended to simplify analysis and auditing of public IPv4 addresses.</p>
<h3>10 years later</h3>
<p>It is now more than a decade since IPv6 was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2012/06/05/ipv6_launch_day/">officially launched</a>, but adoption has been slow and gradual as many organizations saw little need to change at first, especially when managing a migration from the older standard to the new one was likely to be complex.</p>
<p>Although the world officially ran out of unallocated IPv4 addresses in 2019, according to the European regional Internet registry RIPE, it <a target="_blank" href="https://labs.ripe.net/author/wilhelm/ipv6-10-years-out-an-analysis-in-users-tables-and-traffic/">posted figures</a> last year showing that the IPv4 routing table still has six times as many entries as that for IPv6.</p>
<p>However, this apparent disparity may be slightly misleading, it claimed, as internet registries have taken advantage of the massive 128-bit address space of IPv6 to ensure that "organizations receive blocks that are, in many cases, large enough to cover all their future addressing needs" when allocating new address ranges, whereas IPv4 saw ever smaller allocation sizes as the address space filled up.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/07/ovhcloud_ipv4/">OVHcloud opens up Bring Your Own IP service for IPv4 failover</a></li>
</ul>
<p>"Even once all networks have deployed and announced IPv6, we can expect the routing table to be smaller than that for IPv4," RIPE claimed.</p>
<p>RIPE also quoted IPv6 adoption by end users last year, as estimated by Google and APNIC, the regional internet address registry for the Asia-Pacific region, as being between 30 percent and 40 percent.</p>

        

<p>But as <em>The Register</em> wrote back when IPv4 addresses officially ran out, it is going to be with us for a good few years yet. RIPE was predicting then that it might take "five to 10 years" before the world starts to truly abandon the IPv4 address space. Four years of that have already passed, and IPv4 still seems to be going as strong as ever. ®</p>

<div><p>When you think about the Fibonacci sequence, you probably imagine a swirling vortex of oscillating points stretching outwards to infinity:</p>
<p><canvas id="teaser" width="384" height="256"><a href="https://ianthehenry.com/posts/fibonacci/hero.f8f0320540a779c19ec927ada02ec9ecbfd90a6d6d418f8e71e99ac4e5d4deca.png"><picture>

</canvas></p>
<p>Okay, no, obviously you don’t. <em>Yet</em>.</p>
<p>When you think about the Fibonacci sequence, you probably flush with a latent rage when you remember that it is, more often than not, the way that we introduce the concept of “recursive functions” to new programmers, in some sort of cruel hazing intended to make it harder for them to ever appreciate how recursion can help them write better programs. Sometimes we even add memoization, and call it “dynamic programming,” in order to impress upon them that even the most trivial problems deserve complex, inefficient solutions.</p>
<p>Er, okay, you probably don’t think about the Fibonacci sequence much at all. It doesn’t, you know, come up very often.</p>
<p>But I hope that you will spend some time thinking about it with me today, because I think that the Fibonacci sequence – despite being a terrible showcase for recursion – is a really interesting vector for discussing some techniques from linear algebra.</p>

</div>
<p>We will spend no time on the recursive Fibonaccis; I’m sure that you’ve seen them before. Instead, let’s skip right to the “obvious” way to calculate Fibonacci numbers:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>fib</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>current</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>previous</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>n</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>next</span> <span>=</span> <span>current</span> <span>+</span> <span>previous</span><span>;</span>
    <span>previous</span> <span>=</span> <span>current</span><span>;</span>
    <span>current</span> <span>=</span> <span>next</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>current</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>No recursion, no memoization. We have two pieces of state: the “current number” and the “previous” number, and at every step of the iteration we advance both of these to new values.</p>
<p>But there’s something very interesting about this function: the new values for our state are a <em>linear combination</em> of the old values.</p>
<pre><code>current'  = current + previous
previous' = current
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>x'</code> to mean “the next value for <code>x</code>.”</p>
<p>And you might recognize this as a “system of linear equations.” I think it’s more obvious when we write it like this:</p>
<pre><code>current'  = 1 * current + 1 * previous
previous' = 1 * current + 0 * previous
</code></pre>
<p>And you might remember that there’s another, more cryptic way to write down a system of linear equations:</p>

<p>This is exactly the same thing! This is just another way of writing the equation – it’s just a shorthand notation.</p>
<p>Here, let’s test it out to make sure of that:</p>

<p>Well that’s exactly what we expected – 13 is the next Fibonacci number in the sequence, and 8 was the previous one.</p>
<p>We can, of course, repeat this process, by applying the system of linear equations again:</p>

<p>Or, to put that another way:</p>

<p>And here’s why we care: matrix multiplication is associative, so we can actually think of that like this:</p>

<p>Or:</p>

<p>In other words: given a system of linear equations to find the <em>next</em> state of our iteration, we can square the matrix-of-coefficients of the system to find a new system of linear equations that represents “two states from now.”</p>
<p>Of course we don’t <em>need</em> matrices to do this. We can compute a formula for “two steps” of our iteration using term substitution:</p>
<pre><code>current'  = current + previous
previous' = current

current''  = current' + previous'
previous'' = current'

current''  = (current + previous) + current
previous'' = (current + previous)

current''  = 2 * current + previous
previous'' = current + previous
</code></pre>
<p>Which is a new system of linear equations – which we can represent as a matrix as well.</p>

<p>We got the same result, because of course we did: multiplying by this matrix really <em>means</em> “advance to the next state.” Multiplying twice means “advance to the next state and then advance to the next state after that.”</p>
<p>And we can keep going. What’s the state three steps from now?</p>

<p>Or, more concisely:</p>

<p>If we do this repeatedly, you might notice a familiar pattern start to emerge:</p>



<p>Which makes sense, doesn’t it? Because if we multiply this matrix with the matrix <code>[1 0]</code> – our starting values – then it’s going to advance forward through six steps of the Fibonacci sequence in a single leap. So naturally we have to be encoding <em>something</em> about the sequence itself in the matrix – otherwise we wouldn’t be able to advance by N steps in constant time.</p>
<p>Now, the insight that takes this from linear to logarithmic is that we don’t have to do this multiplication one step at a time. We can multiply in leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>Let’s call our original starting matrix F, for Fibonacci.</p>

<p>We’ve already calculated F<sup>2</sup>:</p>

<p>And now it’s only one more matrix multiplication to calculate F<sup>4</sup>:</p>

<p>We can use this fact to calculate arbitrary matrix powers, by breaking the problem up into sums of powers of two:</p>

<p>And by doing that, we can calculate the nth Fibonacci number in only log<sub>2</sub>(n) steps.</p>

<p>Okay, so that’s fun and all, but that’s not really what this blog post is about.</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but if I came across this matrix in the wild, I would not think “Oh, that’s the Fibonacci sequence”:</p>

<p>I would probably think “huh, I dunno, it’s like, a reflection, sort of, or maybe a shear; what’s a shear again, hang on, I need to see a picture.”</p>
<p>That is, I am used to thinking of matrices as transformations of <em>points in space</em> – scales and rotations and things like that. I’m not really used to thinking of matrices as “state machines.”</p>
<p>But this duality is the beauty of linear algebra! Matrices are transformations of points in space and graphs and state machines all at the same time.</p>
<p>So let’s take a look at the Fibonacci <em>transformation</em>, applied to arbitrary points in R<sup>2</sup>:</p>

<p>That animation is progressively applying and removing the transformation, so we can get some intuition for how it deforms a square. But we’re really more interested in repeated applications of the transformation. So let’s start with the same points, but multiply by that same matrix over and over:</p>

<p>Interesting. Over time, they have a tendency to stretch out along the long diagonals of this rhombus. Let’s zoom out:</p>

<p>Every time a point reflects over that diagonal, it reflects at a slightly different angle, slowly converging towards this straight line.</p>
<p>You might already have an idea of what that straight line means. You might know that, if you look at the ratio between subsequent Fibonacci numbers, they approximate the <em>golden ratio</em>:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<pre><code>1  /  1 = 1
2  /  1 = 2
3  /  2 = 1.5
5  /  3 = 1.666...
8  /  5 = 1.6
13 /  8 = 1.625
21 / 13 = 1.61538462
34 / 21 = 1.61904762
</code></pre>
<p>The golden ratio is irrational, but every subsequent Fibonacci number is a better and better rational approximation. (The golden ratio is around 1.618033988749 – so we’re already pretty close.)</p>
<p>It’s interesting to see that these estimations don’t “sneak up” on the golden ratio. In fact they alternate between over- and under-estimating it. Which is exactly what we saw in our visualization!</p>
<p>If you return to the “state machine” interpretation of our matrix, remember that the value we’re plotting as <code>x</code> is really “the current Fibonacci number,” and the value we’re plotting as <code>y</code> is “the previous Fibonacci number.” So the ratio between successive numbers – <code>x/y</code> – is just the slope of the lines that our points are traveling along. And we could see points reflecting over that diagonal, over- and under-shooting it, slowly converging… towards the line whose slope is the golden ratio.</p>
<p>Which is, in fact, the “long diagonal” of our rhombus.</p>
<p>And this makes sense, I think – this isn’t some weird coincidence. The golden ratio is all about the ratio between parts and wholes being the same as ratio between parts. And the Fibonacci sequence is all about adding together parts to become wholes that become parts in the next number of the sequence.</p>
<p>Here, our two parts are the “current” and “previous” values, and the whole that they make is the “next” Fibonacci number. Even if we start with two numbers that are completely unrelated to the Fibonacci sequence – say, <code>8</code> and <code>41</code> – the simple way that we pick the next number will cause us to approximate the golden ratio after only a few iterations:</p>
<pre><code>8 / 41 = 0.1951219
(8 + 41 = 49) / 8 = 6.125
(49 + 8 = 57) / 49 = 1.16326531
(57 + 49 = 106) / 57 = 1.85964912
(106 + 57 = 163) / 106 = 1.53773585
</code></pre>
<p>Why is that? Well, because of the definition of the golden ratio.</p>

<p>This is <em>extremely</em> unrigorous, but I can try to sketch out a very informal argument for why this is:</p>
<p>Let’s say the ratio between <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> is some unknown quantity <code>S</code>. It’s not the golden ratio, it might not be anywhere near the golden ratio; we have no idea what it is. In my 8 and 41 example, it wasn’t even in the right ballpark.</p>
<div>
<p>A/B = S</p>
<p>(A + B) / A = (1 + B / A) = 1 + (1/S)</p>
</div>
<p>So the ratio between the next element in our series and A will be <code>(1 + (1/S))</code>.</p>
<p>We still don’t know what <code>S</code> is! But if we do this <em>again</em>…</p>
<div>
<p>A' / B' = 1 + (1/S)</p>
<p>(A' + B') / A' =</p>
<p>(1 + (B' / A')) =</p>
<p>1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / S)))</p>
</div>
<p>After each iteration, the original <code>S</code> will become a smaller and smaller component in the final answer, until eventually we’ll just have an expression that looks like this:</p>
<div>
<p>1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / ...)))))))</p>
</div>
<p>Whatever our original <code>S</code> was, its contribution to the final result will eventually be negligible. Even after just a few iterations, we can see that the choice of <code>S</code> doesn’t make a huge difference in the outcome:</p>
<div>
<p>1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / -5000))))))) = 1.6667</p>
<p>1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / (1 + (1 / 0.001))))))) = 1.5002</p>
</div>
<p>And of course even that will fade away after a few more steps.</p>
<p>In fact the version of that expression with an infinite number of steps – where there is no <code>S</code> at all, but just an infinite sequence of divisions – is the “continued fraction” expression of the golden ratio.</p>
<p>Except, well, I’m lying here.</p>
<p>That residue will not fade away for <em>all</em> values of <code>S</code>. First of all, if <code>S</code> is zero, it doesn’t matter how small that term gets – you’re not going to squeeze a number out of it.</p>
<p>But there is another, more interesting value of <code>S</code> that breaks this rule. There is <em>one</em> other number that will not tend towards 1.618 when you repeatedly take its reciprocal and add one. It is the number that is already one plus its own reciprocal:</p>
<div>
<p>1 + (1 / 1.61803399) = 1.61803399</p>
</div>
<p>Oh, gosh, yes, the golden ratio is one plus its own reciprocal. But I was talking about the <em>other</em> number with that property:</p>
<div>
<p>1 + (1 / -0.61803399) = -0.61803399</p>
</div>
<p>This number is (1 - φ), and it is also -φ<sup>-1</sup>. The golden ratio is weird like that.</p>
<p>That number is a weird number, because if we have two numbers with that ratio – say, <code>-1.236</code> and <code>2</code> – and we applied our transformation, those points would not spread their wings towards the diagonal. What would they do instead?</p>

<p>Aha. Well, that makes sense.</p>
<p>Some points tend towards the top right, some points tend towards the bottom left, but some points get <em>stuck</em>. Sucked into the origin, cursed to forever travel along this one straight line.</p>
<p>Points along the long diagonal also travel in a straight line – they don’t bounce over the diagonal, because they’re already on it. Let’s just focus on these perfectly straight lines:</p>

<p>Not all matrices will produce straight lines like this when you apply them repeatedly. A rotation matrix, for example, will always change the direction of every single line each time you multiply a point by it.</p>
<p>These straight lines are called <em>eigenvectors</em>, which is German for something like “intrinsic vector” or “characteristic vector."<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Well, to be more precise, any particular point on those straight lines is an “eigenvector.” The vector <code>[φ 1]</code> is an eigenvector, and so is <code>[-2.1φ -2.1]</code>. And the vector <code>[-1/φ 1]</code> is an eigenvector, and so is <code>[-2/φ 2]</code>.</p>
<p>But all of the eigenvectors on each line are “similar,” so I’m just going to pick <code>[φ 1]</code> and <code>[(1-φ) 1]</code> as our two representative eigenvectors.</p>
<p>When you multiply an eigenvector of a matrix by the matrix itself, you get back a new eigenvector on “the same line.” That is to say, you get back another eigenvector that is just some scalar multiple of the original eigenvector.</p>
<p>For example, when we multiply our first eigenvector by the Fibonacci matrix:</p>

<p>Well… it’s not <em>obvious</em> that this is the case, but we actually just scaled the vector by φ. Because φ<sup>2</sup> = φ + 1. The golden ratio is weird.</p>
<p>Similarly:</p>

<p>We scaled it by (1 - φ), again somewhat cryptically:</p>
<div>
<p>(1 - φ)(1 - φ) =</p>
<p>(1 - 2φ + φ<sup>2</sup>) =</p>
<p>(1 - 2φ + φ + 1) =</p>
<p>(2 - φ)</p>
</div>
<p>So when we multiply our Fibonacci matrix with its eigenvectors, we scale those numbers by φ and (1 - φ). These scaling factors are called “eigenvalues,” and it’s <em>weird</em> that they look so much like the eigenvectors. That’s… that’s a weird Fibonacci coincidence, a weird golden ratio thing, and not a general pattern that holds for eigenvectors and eigenvalues in general.</p>
<p>Okay, so why do we care about this?</p>
<p>Well, once we know the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix, we can actually perform repeated matrix multiplication in <em>constant</em> time.</p>
<p><em>…Sort of</em>. You have to imagine a big asterisk after that sentence, which I will explain below.</p>
<p>To explain how, we’re going to need to do a little bit of linear algebra. But first, I just want to restate everything I’ve said so far in explicit notation:</p>
<p>Multiplying F with each eigenvector is the same as multiplying that eigenvector by its corresponding eigenvalue. So:</p>

<p>And:</p>

<p>Right. But there’s actually a way to write those two equalities as a single equality:</p>

<p>Instead of writing out each eigenvector as a separate column vector, I stuck them into a matrix. And instead of scaling each one by a scalar, I multiplied that matrix by a diagonal matrix.</p>
<p>This is the same statement, though: right-multiplication by a diagonal matrix just means “scale the columns of the left matrix by the corresponding diagonal value.” We can gut check this by performing the multiplcation, and seeing that we’re making the exact same statements as before:</p>


<p>But now we’re making these statement about both eigenvectors in parallel.</p>
<p>This equality – this statement about how multiplication by the Fibonacci matrix scales eigenvectors – is the secret to computing Fibonacci numbers in “constant time”:</p>

<p>The trick here is that we’re going to right-multiply both sides of the equation by the inverse of our eigenvector matrix. This will eliminate it from the left-hand side entirely:</p>

<p>And now we have a new way to calculate the “next Fibonacci number.” Previously we knew how to do it by multiplying with the matrix <code>F</code>. Now we can do it by multiplying with, uhh, this inverse eigenvector matrix thing, and then the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, and then the non-inverse matrix-of-eigenvectors.</p>
<p>Much simpler, right?</p>
<p>This is getting really long and complicated and I’m going to run out of space soon, so let’s give these things names:</p>



<p>That’s an upper-case lambda, and look, it’s just the convention for the eigenvalue matrix. Eigenvalues are called <code>λ</code>, and when you put them in a diagonal matrix you call it <code>Λ</code>. I don’t make the rules here.</p>
<p>Now that we have some abbreviations, we can write that as the much more palatable:</p>

<p>Now, the whole reason that we’re doing this is to take advantage of another trick of associativity:</p>




<p>That was very abstract, so take a second to think about what this <em>means</em>. F<sup>2</sup> is the matrix that calculates two steps of our Fibonacci state machine. And we can use this same trick to calculate <em>any</em> power of F, just by calculating powers of Λ.</p>

<p>And this is good, because Λ is a <em>diagonal</em> matrix. And it’s really easy to exponentiate a diagonal matrix! You just exponentiate each element of its diagonal. We don’t even need to use repeated squaring.</p>
<p>This means that we can actually calculate arbitrary powers of F in <em>constant</em> time… if we pretend that exponentiation of a scalar is a constant time operation.</p>
<p>It’s not, though. I mean, yes, exponentiation of an IEEE 754 64-bit floating-point <em>is</em> constant time, but that’s not what we said. We’re talking about exponentiating an irrational number, and my computer can only represent approximations of that number, and that floating-point error adds up fast. So in order to actually use this to compute large Fibonacci numbers, we would need to use arbitrary-precision floating point, and exponentiating arbitrary precision values is <em>not</em> constant time. It’s… I don’t know, probably logarithmic? But like both to the exponent and the size of the result, and the size of the result is increasing exponentially, so it nets out to linear? I don’t actually know.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>But I don’t want to spoil the fun. This is still a very interesting trick, and it’s worth understanding how it works, even if it doesn’t actually give us a way to compute arbitrarily large Fibonacci numbers in constant time.</p>
<p>So: what are we doing.</p>
<p>We moved a bunch of symbols around, and we wound up with this expression:</p>

<p>But I don’t really know what Q<sup>-1</sup> means, and it’s not really clear to me why I should care. Why is multiplying by these three weird matrices the same as multiplying by F? What, intuitively, are we doing here?</p>
<p>At a high level, we’re translating points into a different coordinate system, then doing something to it, and then translating them back into our original coordinate system.</p>
<p>You already know that we can write any point in space as a vector – X and Y coordinates. That’s what we’ve been doing this whole time.</p>
<p>But we can <em>also</em> write a point in space as the sum of two other vectors. Like, <code>[5 3]</code>. We could write that as <code>[1 2] + [4 1]</code> instead. Which, okay, sure. That’s not very interesting.</p>
<p>One “interesting” way to write <code>[5 3]</code> is as the sum of these two vectors: <code>[5 0] + [0 3]</code>. Or, to say that another way:</p>

<p>This is interesting because <code>[1 0]</code> and <code>[0 1]</code> are basically the “X axis” and “Y axis.” And we can think of the point <code>[5 3]</code> as a (trivial!) linear combination of these two axes.</p>
<p>But we could pick <em>different</em> axes. We can pick any vectors we want as our axes,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> so let’s pretend for a moment that our axes are <code>[1 1]</code> and <code>[1 -1]</code> instead. Which means that we would write <code>[5 3]</code> as:</p>

<p>Or, to write that another way:</p>

<p>Alright. Why do we care?</p>
<p>Well, we can think of this vector-of-coefficients, <code>[4 1]</code>, as another way to identify the point in space <code>x=5 y=3</code> when we we’re pretending that our axes are <code>[1 1]</code> and <code>[1 -1]</code>. Except in linear algebra we’d call these “basis vectors” instead of “axes.”</p>
<p>But how did we find the coefficients <code>[4 1]</code>? Well, I just found that one by hand; it was pretty easy. But <em>in general</em>, if we want to express some other <em>point</em> using these basis vectors – let’s say <code>[63 -40]</code> – we’ll need to solve an equation that looks like this:</p>

<p>And we can do that by, you know, regular algebra. We “divide” both sides by our matrix-of-basis-vectors, by left-multiplying with the inverse matrix:</p>

<p>And after the inverses cancel, we’re left with the following formula:</p>

<p>And the problem reduces to matrix inversion.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t know about you, but I don’t remember how to invert a matrix. I know there’s a formula in two dimensions, but the only thing I remember about it is that it involves calculating the determinant, and I forgot how to do that too. So let’s just ask a computer to invert it for us:</p>

<p>Hmm. I feel like I probably could’ve worked that out myself.</p>
<p>But that lets us solve the equation, and figure out how to write the point <code>[63 -40]</code> as a combination of the vectors <code>[1 1]</code> and <code>[1 -1]</code>:</p>

<p>Great! We did it.</p>
<p>And <em>here’s why we care:</em></p>
<p>We can use this exact same trick to write down the points in our Fibonacci sequence as a linear combination of our two eigenvectors. Like this:</p>

<p>Click or tap to add points there, to see how we can write each point in space as a combination of the “short diagonal” and “long diagonal” eigenvectors of our matrix.</p>
<p>Normally to identify a point in space we would give its XY coordinates: go this far along the X-axis, then this far along the Y-axis. But here we’re representing points in “φ” and “1 - φ” coordinates: go this far along the short diagonal, then this far along the long diagonal.</p>
<p>But how do we know how far to go along these diagonals? Well, we “divide by” the eigenvectors. In other words, we have to compute the inverse of this matrix:</p>


<p>Now, matrix inversion is boring, so I’m just presenting the answer here. This inverse matrix is how we can convert from “XY coordinates” into “eigenvector coordinates.”</p>
<p>Let’s work through a concrete example to make sure this works.</p>
<p><code>[8 5]</code> is a point on the Fibonacci sequence. We can express that as a combination of eigenvectors instead:</p>

<p>4.96 and 0.04 are the coefficients we will pair with our eigenvectors: we have to travel 4.96 units down the long diagonal, and 0.04 units along the short diagonal to arrive at the point <code>[8 5]</code>.</p>

<p>Great. It worked!</p>
<p>But that wasn’t very interesting – we just converted our point into the eigenvector basis and then right back into the normal XY basis. It was kind of a pointless transformation.</p>
<p>But we don’t have to do the unconversion immediately. We can keep the point in this “eigenbasis” for a little while, and do stuff to the vector-of-coefficients, and <em>then</em> convert it back.</p>
<p>Specifically, we can scale the coefficients by the eigenvalues of our Fibonacci matrix. We can multiply the “long diagonal” component by Φ<sup>2</sup>, and multiply the short diagonal component by (1 - Φ)<sup>2</sup>, and we’ll have a new point: something close to <code>[12.985 0.015]</code>. And if we convert that back into XY coordinates:</p>

<p>We just advanced our point two more steps along the Fibonacci sequence, with nothing more than scalar exponentiation and a constant number of vector operations.</p>
<p>This is exactly the same as the expression:</p>

<p>But as someone with no background in linear algebra, I find it easy to get lost in the notation, so it’s easier for me to think about this as operations on separate column vectors rather than as operations on matrices. Even though they are the same thing.</p>
<p>Of course, calculating two steps of the Fibonacci sequence in constant time isn’t that impressive. But we can do the same with Φ<sup>1000</sup>, and use that to calculate the thousandth Fibonacci number in constant time.</p>
<p>…Assuming we could calculate Φ<sup>1000</sup> in constant time. Which we can’t, in real life.</p>
<hr>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p>The post is over; you saw the trick. “Eigendecomposition,” this is called.</p>
<p>I glossed over a few steps – I spent absolutely no time explaining <em>how I knew</em> the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix, for example. I just asserted that they were related to the golden ratio. But in reality you can solve for them, or ask a computer to do it for you. It’s pretty mechanical, like matrix inversion – it seems linear algebra is best explored with a repl nearby.</p>
<p>In any case, I think that the <em>why</em> of eigendecomposition is more interesting than the <em>how</em>.</p>
<p>As for the Fibonacci sequence… well, this is a pretty terrible way to actually calculate Fibonacci numbers. Even if we pretend that we only care about numbers that can fit in IEEE 754 double-precision floats, we <em>still</em> can’t use this technique to calculate very many Fibonacci numbers, because the floating-point error adds up too quickly.</p>
<p>But if we only care about double-precision floats… well, there is one more Fibonacci implementation to consider. It’s an algorithm that that runs in constant time, and constant space, and covers the full gamut of floating-point numbers without accumulating any error at all…</p>

<p>In case you are one of today’s lucky 10,000: the golden ratio is also very close to the conversion rate between miles and kilometers, so you can use Fibonacci numbers to approximate conversions between miles and kilometers in your head. For example, 80km ≈ 50mi. This is a <em>weirdly</em> good conversion – the exact answer is 49.7097mi.</p>
<p>It even works when you don’t have a round Fibonacci number to work with. 120kph is probably around 90% of 130kph, and 90% of 80mph is 72mph… the correct answer would be 74.6mph, but we got a decent ballpark with nothing but eyeball math.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Straight lines are eigenvectors, but eigenvectors are not necessarily straight lines. Rotation matrices <em>also</em> have eigenvectors, but they have <em>complex</em> eigenvectors. Straight lines like this are <em>real</em> eigenvectors.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The exact same argument applies to the “logarithmic” exponentiation-by-squaring algorithm as well – squaring arbitrarily large numbers requires arbitrary precision multiplication. It feels different to me, though, because of floating point error: when you’re exponentiating eigenvalues, you need to use arbitrary precision arithmetic even when your final answer could fit into a double. But the integer squaring approach only needs bigints when the Fibonacci numbers themselves become too large to fit into words.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4" role="doc-endnote">
<p>As long as the vectors we pick are “linearly independent” – there’s no way to express <code>[5 3]</code> as a combination of <code>[1 0]</code> and <code>[2 0]</code>, for example.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:4" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

The hosts add all kinds of nonsense rules when you show up or after you book that are never disclosed and they do nothing about it. There is even a news article where the CEO spent a bunch of time living in airbnbs and said he experienced all this nonsense, but still nothing is done about it.</p><p>I really enjoy the authentic experiences at airbnb, but I've been burned too many times and think it's outrageous to spend thousands of dollars on high end airbnbs and pay fees for things like cleaning and then be expected to clean on my vacation or be subject to some nonsensical rule and worry my whole vacation. I'm really torn about whether it's a good service or whether it sucks but you should know what you're getting into.

We have such a bias for the new, it tends not to be a popular opinion. But so much of this technology innovation just leads us to create new versions of the same old, because the incentives are to financialize and exploit financial advantage and to reconcentrate wealth and fortune, not actually innovate.</p><p>It's perhaps not the most thought out thesis, but I wonder about it, and whenever Airbnb comes up it brings this question up for me. I mean landing rockets changes the economics of space… we have innovation. It’s just that most of it just seems to be merely a greater efficiency of delivery masquerading as “disruption.”

under the premise that running closer to the users produces faster response times.</p><p>But as we’ve seen, the responses times for lots of round trips to a centralised database are slower than if the app was deployed near to the database.</p><p>Logically the next step is top get a copy of your data as close to all the edge locations.</p><p><img src="https://zknill.io/img/database-near-edge.png#center" data-src="/img/database-near-edge.png#center" data-srcset="/img/database-near-edge.png#center, /img/database-near-edge.png#center 1.5x, /img/database-near-edge.png#center 2x" data-sizes="auto" alt="/img/database-near-edge.png#center" title="Edge apps with distributed databases"></p><h2 id="data-consistency">Data consistency</h2><p>Imagine a new user signs up to your app. All users need a unique username because that’s how your app identifies them:

The only safe way to do that is to ask/be told by the other copies of the data if that username is unique or not.
But to consult all the other copies of the data, we’d need to contact them.
To contact the other copies of the data we will encounter the same cross-region latency that we suffered from when we had the database in a single location.</p><p><img src="https://zknill.io/img/cross-region-db-latency.png#center" data-src="/img/cross-region-db-latency.png#center" data-srcset="/img/cross-region-db-latency.png#center, /img/cross-region-db-latency.png#center 1.5x, /img/cross-region-db-latency.png#center 2x" data-sizes="auto" alt="/img/cross-region-db-latency.png#center" title="Cross region database latency"></p><h2 id="two-choices">Two choices</h2><p>If we want to maintain a copy of the data close to the edge app, and by extension close to the user,

we have to deal with the cross region latency at some point.</p><p>The two choices we have boil down to; when do we want to deal with the cross-region latency required to make the data consistent?</p><ol><li>On writes – we can choose to contact the other copies of the data when writing a record, to make sure that no other users have already registered that username.</li><li>On reads – we can choose to handle the data consistency problems on reads.</li></ol><blockquote><p>Strictly, we can choose to do both, because my usage of “consistent” so far in this post is quite vague, but we will come to that in a moment.</p></blockquote><p>Lets start with <strong>writes</strong>.

The worst case is a little harder, because in this example we have two competing
requests that are racing to register the username. We need a way to decide which one will (and did) win.</p><h2 id="append-only-logs">Append-only logs</h2><p>Pretty much all databases solve the problem of two competing requests with an append-only log.
Often called a Write-ahead log or WAL.
Even if the database consists of only a single database server, the database still has to manage conflicting concurrent requests, and will still use a log.</p><p>These logs are append only - that is the database can only write to them - individual log events cannot be deleted. (Although outdated records in the log can be trimmed as a whole.)</p><p>The database has exactly one writer to the log,
and when our two competing requests try and “write” (register the username),
exactly one of those requests will be first,
and the second will be rejected.</p><p><img src="https://zknill.io/img/append-only-log.png#center" data-src="/img/append-only-log.png#center" data-srcset="/img/append-only-log.png#center, /img/append-only-log.png#center 1.5x, /img/append-only-log.png#center 2x" data-sizes="auto" alt="/img/append-only-log.png#center" title="Append only log"></p><p>To guarantee that there’s exactly one writer to the log that our ‘register username’ write will go into, we need one database server to be responsible for that log.
This database server called the “leader” or “master”.</p><p><img src="https://zknill.io/img/write-forwarding.png#center" data-src="/img/write-forwarding.png#center" data-srcset="/img/write-forwarding.png#center, /img/write-forwarding.png#center 1.5x, /img/write-forwarding.png#center 2x" data-sizes="auto" alt="/img/write-forwarding.png#center" title="Write forwarding"></p><p>In this diagram, the user is registering a username. The database in Australia is forwarding the write to the database in the USA. The database in the USA is the ’leader’ for the
username’s log, and writes the username to the log. The username is now ’taken’, and can’t be registered by anyone else.</p><p>We are dealing with the cross-region latency between Australia and USA when the write happens, to make sure that the data is consistent.
(To make sure that no two users can register the same username).</p><p>The problem is that the write is now in the USA database, but not in the Australia database.
If the user were to immediately make a request for their username, it wouldn’t exist in the Australia database (yet).</p><p>This property of the system / database (or lack of) is called <strong>read-your-own-writes</strong>. And describes a system where some data is available to be read immediately after its been
written.
Not being able to read your own writes creates a weird user experience for the user,
where they are unsure if they have actually completed the task they wanted to,
because they can’t immediately see the data they have just written.</p><p>To read the writes, we need replication. The log needs to be replicated back to the Australia database.</p><p><img src="https://zknill.io/img/read-own-writes.png#center" data-src="/img/read-own-writes.png#center" data-srcset="/img/read-own-writes.png#center, /img/read-own-writes.png#center 1.5x, /img/read-own-writes.png#center 2x" data-sizes="auto" alt="/img/read-own-writes.png#center" title="Read your own writes"></p><p>The Australia database should only return a successful response to the user once it has received a segment of the log that contains the write that was originally forwarded to the USA database. This ensure that the Australia database can read its own writes.</p><p>If we didn’t care about the read-your-own-writes property, we could return to the user immediately and assume the replication would happen sometime later.</p><p>When touched on the <strong>‘Two choices’</strong> earlier, we covered writes but not reads. We saw how the database suffers from the inter-region latency when forwarding a write.</p><p>The thing about reads is; we might not care.
We might be perfectly happy that the France, etc database is slightly behind the other USA database.
We might not care that the most recent write has not been replicated to the France database yet.</p><h2 id="eventually-consistent">Eventually consistent</h2><p>If we don’t care that the most recent write on the database leader (USA) has not yet been replicated to the France database, then we call this system <strong>eventually consistent</strong>.
That is, <em>eventually</em> the write will be replicated to the France database, but we don’t know exactly when. And we possibly don’t care (depending on the exact usage of the system).</p><p>If we <em>did</em> care, we’d call this system <strong>strongly consistent</strong> and we would require the leader to only consider the write successful once it had been fully replicated to all the
other databases.
In this case, all the databases would have all the data all the time, but writes would be much slower, as we would have to wait for all the databases to receive and reflect the
write.</p><h2 id="on-reads">On reads</h2><p>There is one final way to get <strong>strongly consistent</strong> properties of the databases, without requiring the inter-region latency hit on writes. (As we have just been discussing, the
new data is replicated across the regions when it’s written).</p><p>This is number 2, from when we covered the <em>‘Two choices’</em>. On reads.</p><p><img src="https://zknill.io/img/read-forwarding.png#center" data-src="/img/read-forwarding.png#center" data-srcset="/img/read-forwarding.png#center, /img/read-forwarding.png#center 1.5x, /img/read-forwarding.png#center 2x" data-sizes="auto" alt="/img/read-forwarding.png#center" title="Read forwarding"></p><p>Imagine that we hadn’t required the write to be replicated to the Australia database when it was added to the log, and instead embraced an <strong>eventually consistent</strong> system.</p><p>But we had a small number of cases where we needed to make sure that the read we were performing was <strong>strongly consistent</strong>
(that is, it reads exactly the data that any database has, not just the data that this database has received yet from replication.)</p><p>To perform a one-off strongly consistent read, we could forward that read to the leader (USA), add that read to the database log, and wait for the read to be replicated back to the Australia database.
Once the Australia database receives the read in the log, it knows that it has all the most up to date data for that specific point in time, and can safely execute the read from
its local datastore.</p><p>But once again, we have to suffer the cross-region latency for the read to be forwarded to the leader database and the log to be replicated back again.</p><h2 id="what-do-we-do">What do we do?</h2><p>As I said at the start:</p><blockquote><p>The main thing stopping developers from adopting edge computing is data consistency.</p></blockquote><p>We can put the apps near the users, and a copy of the data near the apps, but in doing so we sacrifice data consistency or we suffer network latency costs.</p><p>We can’t beat physics, and data can only be transmitted so fast across the network between regions. This means that we have to make choices about what kind of data consistency we
want, and importantly <strong>we have to decide: at which point do we want to deal with the latency</strong>.</p><p>Most internet apps are read-heavy, there are more reads than writes, so largely it makes sense to deal with the latency on writes.
We can do this by forwarding the writes to some leader for that piece of data (e.g. the log for usernames),
and waiting until that write is replicated back to us (so we can read our own writes).</p><h2 id="some-examples">Some examples</h2><p>The following are some examples of database systems that are optimised for read-heavy applications where we eat the latency cost on writes.</p><ul><li><a href="https://turso.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Turso</a>: writes are forwarded to the leader, reads are local.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/superfly/litefs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Litefs</a>: writes are forwarded to the leader, reads are local.</li><li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/warm-standby.html#SYNCHRONOUS-REPLICATION" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Postgres warm standby in ‘synchronous’ mode</a>: writes are committed to the leader and replica at the same time, reads can be from the replica.</li></ul><p>–</p><h4 id="footnote-beat-the-system">Footnote: Beat the system</h4><p>Finally it’s worth mentioning, some databases try and beat the system by structuring data in a specific way.
For example, giving the Australia database ownership over all the Australian data and user requests, and not letting region-specific datasets overlap with each other.
This can work, but it add some other difficult constraints when you want to query across datasets or join them together.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Alpine-Linux-Prolific-Packager">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Alpine-Linux-Prolific-Packager</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36940916">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="OPERATING SYSTEMS" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/operatingsystems.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
Alpine Linux remains one of the most popular lightweight Linux distributions built atop musl libc and Busybox. Alpine Linux has found significant use within containers and the embedded space while now sadly the most prolific maintainer of packages for the Linux distribution has decided to step down from her roles.
</p><p>
Alice "psykose" who is easily responsible for the highest number of commits per author over the past year has decided to step down from maintaining her packages.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2023&amp;image=alpine_package_stats" alt="Alpine package stats"></p>
<p>These <a href="https://git.alpinelinux.org/aports/stats/?period=q&amp;ofs=10">Alpine aports stats</a> put her at 13,894 commits over the past year. In comparison, the second most prolific packager saw just 2,053 commits... Or put another way, psykose has 6.7x the number of commits as the next packager. The 13.8k commits is also about half of the 26.8k commits seen in total over the past year.
</p><p>
Over the weekend I was alerted to the fact that psykose/nekopsykose has begun <a href="https://github.com/alpinelinux/aports/commit/9e88698cc296a8492a8f70938c58f5755f39609d">dropping maintainership</a> of packages she maintained. All of her recent <a href="https://github.com/alpinelinux/aports/commits?author=nekopsykose">alpinelinux/aports commits</a> two days ago were removing packages she oversaw.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=alpine-linux-311&amp;image=alpine_311_2_med"></p>
<p>Curious about the situation, I reached out to Alice and she confirmed she has dropped maintenance of anything she maintained and proceeded to lock herself out of the Alpine Linux systems she had access to. She hasn't decided what to do next but likely "catch up on a year of sleep." She doesn't believe that this will ultimately impact Alpine Linux itself but hopes that others will pick-up what's needed to keep on going with the package maintenance.
</p><p>
In any event, great job to her with all of the packaging work she's done for the Alpine Linux project.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Not as much as I'd hoped, it's probably all about string index into dict and dict management. I may recode into a radix tree. Hard to work out in advance how different it would be: People optimised core datastructs pretty well.</p><p>Uplift from normal python was trivial. Most dev time spent fixing pip3 for pypy in debian not knowing what apts to load, with a lot of "stop using pip" messaging.

This means either we switch our prod to pypy, which won't be possible because I am very new in this team and that would be seen as a big, risky change by the others, or we keep in mind the tests do not run using the exact same runtime as production servers (which might cause bugs to go unnoticed and reach production, or failing tests that would otherwise work on a live environment).</p><p>I think if I ever started a python project right now, I'd probably try and use pypy from the start, since (at least for web development) there does not seem to be any downsides to using it.</p><p>Anyways, thank you very much for your hard work !

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/31/nasa_mistakenly_disconnects_voyager_2/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/31/nasa_mistakenly_disconnects_voyager_2/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36940626">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>NASA revealed on Friday that its venerable Voyager 2 probe is currently incommunicado, because the space agency pointed its antenna in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>By the time the <a target="_blank" href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/sunspot/2023/07/28/mission-update-voyager-2-communications-pause/">news</a> was released, the antenna on the spacecraft had been pointing two degrees away from the Earth for over a week.</p>
<p>This left it without the ability to receive commands or transmit data to antennae operated by the Deep Space Network (DSN).</p>

    

<p>NASA reckons the situation is temporary and will not end the probe's nearly 46-year stint in space as it is programmed to recalibrate its position a few times a year. October 15 is the next scheduled reset.</p>

        


        

<p>The space org added that Voyager 2's trajectory is expected to remain unchanged. The probe is currently around 32 billion kilometers from Earth, and gets 15km further away every second. The glitch does not impact Voyager 1, which is currently almost 24 billion clicks away from Earth and hurtling along at 17km/sec while staying in touch with home.</p>
<p>Voyager 2's electrical systems were <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/27/nasa_tweaks_voyager_2s_power/">tweaked</a> earlier this year, in the hope of extending its working life.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/27/nasa_tweaks_voyager_2s_power/">NASA tweaks Voyager 2's power supply to avoid another sensor shutdown</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/05/square_kilometre_array_observatory_construction_commences/">Square Kilometre Array Observatory construction commences</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/31/voyager_1_telemetry_data_corrupted/">Voyager 1 data corrupted by onboard computer that 'stopped working years ago'</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/20/esa_integral_20/">How did ESA's gamma ray-spotting 'scope make it to 20? They totally overdid it</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If that procedure produces good results, a similar adjustment to Voyager 1 is on the cards.</p>
<p>In 2022, Voyager 1 also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/31/voyager_1_telemetry_data_corrupted/">experienced</a> telemetry woes. Scientist found it sent back garbled information to Mission Control. It transpired that data was being routed incorrectly by a computer that had not worked for years.</p>

        

<p>Engineers at that time performed "telesurgery" to correct the issue, which essentially meant commanding the attitude articulation and control system (AACS) to resume sending the data to the right computer. And so the probe carried on.</p>
<p>In the past, engineers have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/31/voyager_1_telemetry_data_corrupted/">compared</a> keeping the probes operational to keeping an old car running. The tech is severely outdated, yet it keeps ticking over – a trend often seen in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/20/esa_integral_20/">spacecraft of past decades</a>.</p>
<p>But while old cars can be lovingly worked on by hand in real time, the Voyagers are over 20 light hours from Earth, and communication crawls along at a tedious 160 bits per second. ®</p>

<p>If you are anything like me, you appreciate solving your every day simple tasks directly from the command line. Creating crafty single shot command lines or a small shell script to solve that special task you figured out you needed and makes your day go a little smoother. A fellow <em>command line cowboy</em>.</p>



<h2>Video presentation</h2>



<p>This feature will be described and detailed on live-streamed video. Join me then and ask me all your questions about this. The video will be done (and recorded for later watching) on <strong>Wednesday August 2 at 08:00 UTC </strong>(10:00 CEST) on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/curlhacker">the curlhacker channel on twitch</a> – as usual.</p>



<h2>Background</h2>



<p>To make life easier for curl users, the tool supports “<a href="https://everything.curl.dev/cmdline/configfile">config files</a>“. They are a set of command line options written in a text file that you can point the curl tool to use. By default curl will check for and use such a config file named <code>.curlrc</code> if placed in your home directory.</p>



<p>One day not too long ago, a user over in <a href="https://curl.se/docs/irc.html">the curl IRC channel</a> asked me if it was possible to use environment variables in such config files to avoid having to actually store secrets directly in the file.</p>







<p>This new variable system that we introduce in <strong>curl 8.3.0</strong> (commit <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/2e160c9c652504e147f474ed920ae891481e299c">2e160c9c65</a>) makes it possible to use environment variable in config files. But it does not stop there. It allows lots of other fun things.</p>



<p>First off, you can <em>set</em> named variables on the command line. Like :</p>



<pre>curl --variable name=content</pre>



<p>or in the config file:</p>



<pre>variable=name=content</pre>



<p>A variable name must only consist of a-z, A-Z, 0-9 or underscore (up to 128 characters). If you set the same name twice, the second set will overwrite the first.</p>



<p>There can be an unlimited amount of variables. A variable can hold up to 10M of content. Variables are set in a left to right order as curl parses the command line or config file.</p>



<h2>Assign</h2>



<p>You can assign a variable a plain fixed string as shown above. Optionally, you can tell curl to populate it with the contents of a file:</p>



<pre>curl --variable name@filename</pre>



<p>or straight from stdin:</p>



<pre>curl --variable name@-</pre>



<h2>Environment variables</h2>



<p>The variables mentioned above are only present in the curl command line. You can also opt to “import” an environment variable into this context. To import $HOME:</p>



<pre>curl --variable %HOME</pre>



<p>In this case above, curl will exit if there is no environment variable by that name. Optionally, you can set a default value for the case where the variable does not exist:</p>



<pre>curl --variable %HOME=/home/nouser</pre>



<h2>Expand variables</h2>



<p>All variables that are set or “imported” as described above can be used in subsequent command line option arguments – or in config files.</p>



<p>Variables must be explicitly asked for, to make sure they do not cause problems for older command lines or for users when they are not desired. To accomplish this, we introduce the <code>--expand-</code> option prefix.</p>



<p>Only when you use  the <code>--expand-</code> prefix in front of an option will the argument get variables expanded.</p>



<p>You reference (expand) a variable like <code>{{name}}</code>. That means two open braces, the variable name and then two closing braces. This sequence will then be replaced by the contents of the variable and  a non-existing variable will expand as blank/nothing.</p>



<p><strong>Trying to show a variable with a null byte causes error</strong></p>



<h2>Examples</h2>



<p>Use the variable named ‘content’ in the argument to <code>--data</code>, telling curl what to send in a HTTP POST:</p>



<pre>--expand-data “{{content}}”</pre>



<p>Create the URL to operate on by inserting the variables ‘host’ and ‘user’.</p>



<pre>--expand-url “https://{{host}}/user/{{user}}”</pre>



<h2>Expand variables</h2>



<p><code>--variable</code> itself can be expanded when you want to create a new variable that uses content from one or more other variables. Like:</p>



<pre>--expand-variable var1={{var2}}
--expand-variable fullname=’Mrs {{first}} {{last}}’
--expand-variable source@{{filename}}</pre>



<h2>Expansion functions</h2>



<p>When expanding a variable, functions can be applied. Like this: <code>{{name:function}}</code></p>



<p>Such variable functions alter how the variable is expanded. How it gets output.</p>



<p>Multiple functions can be applied in a left-to-right order:<br><code>{{name:func1:func2:func3}}</code>.</p>



<p>curl offers four different <em>functions</em> to help you expand variables in the most productive way: trim, json, url and b64:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>trim</strong> – removes leading and trailing whitespace</li>



<li><strong>json</strong> – outputs the variable JSON quoted (but without surrounding quotes)</li>



<li><strong>url</strong> – shows the string URL encoded, also sometimes called percent encoding</li>



<li><strong>b64</strong> – shows the variable base64 encoded</li>
</ul>



<h2>Function examples</h2>



<p>Expands the variable URL encoded. Also known as “percent encoded”.</p>



<pre>--expand-data “name={{name:url}}”</pre>



<p>To trim the variable first, apply both functions (in the right order):</p>



<pre>--expand-data “name={{name:trim:url}}”</pre>



<p>Send the HOME environment variable as part of a JSON object in a HTTP POST:</p>



<pre>--variable %HOME
--expand-data “{ \"homedir\": \"{{HOME:json}}\” "</pre>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
							
<p>In a landmark decision that signals a shift in the balance between user privacy and accountability on social media platforms, <a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/#!/details?id=ECLI:NL:RBDHA:2023:11254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Court of The Hague has ruled</a> that Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd must provide identifying data of an anonymous Facebook user accused of making defamatory allegations.</p>



<p>The accusations surfaced in a private Facebook group focused on dating, where users share experiences about their dates, often including personal information and pictures of the individuals involved. It is common practice in these groups to post messages anonymously, thereby shielding the identity of the person making the post.</p>



<p>In this case, the anonymous user accused the plaintiff, a male Facebook user, of transgressive behaviour, a claim the plaintiff vehemently denies. He asserts that these allegations are not only false but also damaging to his reputation.</p>



<p>The plaintiff sought Meta's assistance in the matter, requesting the removal of the offensive messages and the disclosure of the anonymous user's identity. However, Meta initially responded stating that it did not find the posts defamatory and hence would not accede to his request.</p>



<p>Unsatisfied with Meta's response, the plaintiff took the matter to court. The judge acknowledged that while it couldn't be definitively established that the accusations were baseless without more concrete information, the plaintiff's right to address the allegations was paramount. The judge stated, "Without further factual information, it cannot be completely ruled out that there may be a sound factual basis. If that basis is there, it is conceivable that - however much [the claimant] is affected by this - these statements under the circumstances of the case are not unlawful and freedom of expression should therefore not be restricted."</p>



<p>In a significant ruling, the court ordered Meta to release the identifying data of the anonymous user, stating that the plaintiff's interests outweighed those of the anonymous user and Facebook. The judge ruled that the plaintiff has a real and legitimate interest in addressing the accusations and can only do so with the data held by Meta.</p>



<p>Meta argued that Facebook users should be able to express criticism, even if it is severe and anonymous. However, the judge responded that freedom of expression "is not unlimited" and that the man cannot reply within the closed Facebook groups. Furthermore, Meta's conditions permit data from users to be shared with third parties.</p>



<p>The court's ruling mandates Meta to disclose key identifying information, including the username, email address, telephone number, and the IP address used during registration and logins. Meta faces a penalty of one thousand euros per day, up to a maximum of one hundred thousand euros, if it fails to comply with the court's decision.</p>



<p>The ruling has far-reaching implications for social media platforms and highlights the ongoing challenges faced by tech companies in navigating the delicate balance between user privacy and accountability for online actions.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I’m not a materials scientist. I may update this over time as I collate more information<br>Updated 2023-07-31 – <a href="#sbtable">Spacebattles table</a> (11 online replication efforts)</p>



<p>On 22 July 2023, two mysterious papers were suddenly published in arxiv.org – this is a website of scientific papers that is often the first step to peer-reviewed publication, but it’s not a total confirmation. They were published about two hours apart – the first one, with three authors credited, claims to have created <strong>the world’s first room-temperature-and-pressure (RTP) superconductor. </strong></p>



<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12008">This first paper is short and appears to be hastily written</a>, and has three authors attached: <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Lee%2C+S">Sukbae Lee</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kim%2C+J">Ji-Hoon Kim</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kwon%2C+Y">Young-Wan Kwon</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12037">The second paper is much more detailed</a>, though there are some signs it that was still pushed out a bit quickly. However, even more curiously, it has six authors: <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Lee%2C+S">Sukbae Lee</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kim%2C+J">Jihoon Kim</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kim%2C+H">Hyun-Tak Kim</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Im%2C+S">Sungyeon Im</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=An%2C+S">SooMin An</a>,&nbsp;and <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/cond-mat?searchtype=author&amp;query=Auh%2C+K+H">Keun Ho Auh</a>. The third author of the first paper is removed from the second.</p>



<p><strong>The purported properties of the material labeled “LK-99” are incredible.</strong> Originally synthesised in 1999, not only is it RTP, but the critical temperature is actually 127°C – above the boiling temperature of water. The synthesis method is also shockingly simple: Finely grind and mix Lanarkite (Pb<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)O) and Copper Phosphide (Cu<sub>3</sub>P) and bake it at 925°C in a vacuum chamber for a day. The ability to discover and synthesise it has theoretically been available since the industrial revolution. Now, one should be able to do it in a garage or home lab.</p>



<p>The reaction online is a rapid mix of skepticism and curiosity. Fraudulent claims have occurred before – the previous one claimed it required 10,000 atm, as a deliberate delay to independent verification. That doesn’t exist here. The authorship is also curious: The main authors are experts in superconductivity and magnetic research. It is widely noted that only a maximum of three people can recieve a Nobel Prize. Was the first paper a deliberate attempt to flag themselves as the finders?</p>



<p>Young-Wan Kwon, the removed author from the first paper, <a href="https://twitter.com/sanxiyn/status/1684970570109345792">crashes a science conference</a> several days later and talks about the discovery. He couldn’t demonstrate a sample, and was apparently expelled from the science group months ago. Is this a sign of treachery? In-fighting for credit? It makes the whole thing pass the sniff test. Many of us may not believe it yet, but <strong>they</strong> certainly do. What else could make an expert behave like that?</p>



<p>As I begin writing this post on 30 July, the live reaction – and attempts to replicate it – has been developing day-by-day on the scientific community on Twitter. A space engineering startup in the Los Angeles area <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewmccalip/status/1684821396411809792">coincidentally has all the tools on-hand and available</a>, and quickly orders the materials and blogs about the day-by-day progress of synthesis. <a href="https://twitter.com/sanxiyn/status/1685095248811413504">A Korean user fluent in English</a> begins translating news from Korean newspapers and internet forums. <a href="https://twitter.com/elsa17z/status/1685122285705859072?s=20">A Chinese user does the same</a> for Chinese social media. Scientists who maintain an online presence begin <a href="https://twitter.com/Liv_Boeree/status/1685416132612632576?s=20">explaining the implications</a> and dissect the paper. <a href="https://twitter.com/altryne/status/1685148163223719936?s=20">Someone begins compiling key figures acting as information sources across language barriers.</a></p>



<p>The magic of room-temperature superconductors is something that shows up in sci-fi, and is easily understood at the high-school physics level. But having most of these ongoing news break on Twitter… well, I’m not a heavy user of Twitter, but I never quite figured out a good way to track an event after it has occured. It’s very good for a live feed, but it gets rather scattered if you’re trying to catch up. This post is just my way of making sense of the key opening events.</p>



<p>Is it nothing? Is it less than expected? At the very least, there’s a lot of buzz right now. At the very least, I might stick additional events in chronological order below the next couple of separator lines.</p>



<hr>



<h6>What’s the Big Deal?</h6>



<p>If you need a quick high-school physics primer, here’s the deal:</p>



<p>A superconductor is an electrical conductor with zero resistance. It was first discovered when it was found that resistance drops with temperature, and for some reason, instead of dropping in a curve, some materials immediately drop to zero resistance when they pass a certain point, called the ‘critical temperature’. Zero resistance means that no heat is generated when electricity passes through; in other words, the wire is 100% efficient and energy is not lost over distance, and there’s no heat generation at super-high voltages. The caveat is that the temperature for most of these needs to be way below -200°C. You still need to spend a lot of energy keeping it cool, but the heat doesn’t come from the electricity.</p>



<p>The general result is that any device using superconducting material – such as MRI machines – are bulky and immobile, due to the constant need for cryogenics. A room-temperature superconductor allows for things like an infinitely long power cable without loss, or a portable MRI scanner.</p>



<h6>A Rough History of Original Synthesis to the Paper</h6>



<p>Based on the investigation by <a href="https://twitter.com/8teAPi/status/1684385895565365248">this user</a>, Sukbae Lee and Jihoon Kim originally found the material in 1999 – thus the label “LK-99”. They were in graduate school at the time, and their mentor was also an expert in this area, theorising that there were signs of superconductivity in this, but required more research. They seem to shelve the whole thing due to the nature of graduate school.</p>



<p>Fast-forwarding to 2017, Lee &amp; Kim have scientific careers, and are called back by their mentor, who encourages them to complete the research. However, without any backing – particularly on the English-speaking international level – they work with Young-Wan Kwon and somehow acquire funding.</p>



<p>By 2022 and early 2023, patents are filed. Something happens with Kwon, and he appears to publish the first paper without warning.</p>



<h6>The Third Paper</h6>



<p>In one of the citations for the detailed paper, one of the citations is <a href="http://journal.kci.go.kr/jkcgct/archive/articleView?artiId=ART002955269">one of their own papers</a> published several months prior about the theoretical causes of superconductivity in LK-99. The paper is written in Korean, though there is an abstract in English: The general idea is that a one-dimensional electron structure could explain the high temperature superconductivity of the material, which has a critical temperature of at least over 97°C. </p>



<p>(I’m not a materials scientist so don’t expect a good explanation.)</p>

<h2 id="what-is-matrix">What is Matrix?</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> is an open network for secure and decentralized
communication. Users from every Matrix homeserver can chat with users from all
other Matrix servers. You can even use bridges to communicate with users outside
of Matrix, like a community on Discord.</p>
<h2 id="why-conduit">Why Conduit?</h2>
<p>Conduit is a lightweight open-source server implementation of the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec">Matrix
Specification</a> with a focus on easy setup and low
system requirements. That means you can make your own Conduit setup in just
a few minutes.</p>
<p>Conduit keeps things simple, it's a single binary with an embedded database and
can be much faster than other server implementations in some cases.</p>

<h2>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2023-07-29 Free Public WiFi</h2>

<p>Remember Free Public WiFi?</p>
<p>Once, many years ago, I stayed on the 62nd floor of the Westin Peachtree Plaza
in Atlanta, Georgia. This was in the age when the price of a hotel room was
directly correlated with the price of the WiFi service, and as a high school
student I was not prepared to pay in excess of $15 a day for the internet. As I
remember, a Motel 6 that was not blocks away but within line of sight ended up
filling the role. But even up there, 62 floors from the ground, there was false
promise: Free Public WiFi.</p>
<p>I am not the first person to write on this phenomenon, I think I originally
came to understand it as a result of a 2010 segment of <em>All Things Considered</em>.
For a period of a few years, almost everywhere you went, there was a WiFi
network called "Free Public WiFi." While it was both free and public in the
most literal sense, it did not offer internet access. It was totally useless,
and fell somewhere between a joke, a scam, and an accident of history. Since
I'm not the first to write about it, I have to be the most thorough, and so
let's start out with a discussion of WiFi itself.</p>
<p>The mid-2000s were a coming of age era for WiFi. It had become ubiquitous in
laptops, and the 2007 launch of the iPhone established WiFi as a feature of
mobile devices (yes, various phones had offered WiFi support earlier, but none
sold nearly as well). Yet there weren't always that many networks out there.
Today, it seems that it has actually become less common for cafes to offer WiFi
again, presumably as LTE has reached nearly all cafe customers and fewer people
carry laptops. But in the 2010s, genuinely free, public WiFi had become far
more available in US cities.</p>
<p>Some particularly ambitious cities launched wide-area WiFi programs, and for a
brief time "Municipal WiFi" was a market sector. Portland, where I grew up, was
one of these, with a wide-area WiFi network covering the house I grew up in for
a couple of years. Like most the program didn't survive to see 2020.
Ironically, efforts to address the "digital divide" have lead to a partial
renaissance of municipal WiFi. Many cities now advertise free WiFi service at
parks, libraries, and other public places. I was pleased to see that Mexico
City has a relatively expansive municipal WiFi service, probably taking
advantage of the municipal IP network they have built out for video
surveillance and emergency phones.</p>
<p>The 2000s, though, were different. "Is there WiFi here?" was the sort of
question you heard all the time in the background. WiFi was seen as a revenue
source (less common today, although the hotel industry certainly still has its
holdouts) and so facility-offered WiFi was often costly. A surprising number of
US airports, for example, had either no WiFi or only a paid service even
through the 2010s. I'm sure there are still some like this today, but paid WiFi
seems on the way out [1], probably as a result of the strong competition it
gets from LTE and 5G. The point, though, is that back in 2006 we were all
hungry for WiFi all the time.</p>
<p>We also have to understand that the 802.11 protocol that underlies WiFi is
surprisingly complex and offers various different modes. We deal with this less
today, but in the 2000s it was part of computer user consciousness that WiFi
came in two distinct flavors. 802.11 beacon packets, used to advertise WiFi
networks to nearby devices, include a flag that indicates whether the network
operates in <em>infrastructure mode</em> or <em>ad-hoc mode</em>.</p>
<p>A network in infrastructure mode, basically the normal case, requires all
clients to communicate with the access point (AP). When two clients exchange
traffic, the AP serves as an intermediary, receiving packets from one device
and transmitting them to the other. This might at first seem inefficient, but
this kind of centralization is very common in radio systems as it offers a
simple solution to a complex problem. If a WiFi network consists of three
devices, an AP and two clients (A and B), we know that clients A and B can
communicate with the AP because they are maintaining an association. We don't
know if A and B can communicate with each other. They may be on far opposite
sides of the AP's range, there may be a thick concrete wall between A and B,
one device may have very weak transmit power, etc. Sending all traffic through
the AP solves this problem the same way a traditional radio repeater does, by
serving as an intermediary that is (by definition for an AP) well-positioned in
the network coverage area.</p>
<p>The other basic WiFi mode is the ad-hoc network. In an ad-hoc network, devices
communicate directly with each other. The main advantage of an ad-hoc network
is that no AP is required. This allowed me and a high school friend to
communicate via UnrealIRCd running on one of our laptops during our
particularly engaging US Government/Economics class (we called this
"Governomics"). The main disadvantage of ad-hoc networks is that the loss of a
central communications point makes setup and routing vastly more complicated.
Today, there is a much better established set of technologies for distributed
routing in mesh networks, and yet ad-hoc WiFi is still rare. In the 2000s it
was much worse; ad-hoc mode was basically unusable by anyone not ready to
perform manual IP address management (yes, link local addresses existed and we
even used them for our IRC client configurations, but most people evidently
found these more confusing than helpful).</p>
<p>In general, ad-hoc networks are a bit of a forgotten backwater of consumer WiFi
technology. At the same time, the promise of ad-hoc networks featured heavily
in marketing around WiFi, compelling vendors to offer a clear route to creating
and joining them. This has allowed some weird behaviors to hang around in WiFi
implementations.</p>
<p>Another thing about WiFi networks in the 2000s, and I swear this is all
building to a point, is that the software tools for connecting to them were not
very good. On Windows, WiFi adapter vendors distributed their own software.
Anyone with a Windows laptop in, say, 2005 probably remembers Dell QuickSet
Wireless, Intel PROSet/Wireless (this actually how they style the name), and
Broadcom WLAN Utility. The main thing that these vendor-supported wireless
configuration utilities shared was an astounding lack of quality control, even
by the standards of the time. They were all terrible: bizarre, intrusive,
over-branded UX on top of a network configuration framework that had probably
never worked reliably, even in the original developer's test environment.</p>
<p>Perhaps realizing that this hellscape of software from hardware companies was
undoubtedly having a negative impact on consumer perception of Windows [2],
Microsoft creaked into action. Well, this part is kind of confusing, in a
classically Microsoft way. Windows XP had a built-in wireless configuration
management utility from the start, called Wireless Zero Configuration. The most
irritating thing about the vendor utilities was that they were unnecessary;
most of the time you could just uninstall them and use Wireless Zero and
everything would work fine.</p>
<p>Wireless Zero was the superior software too, perhaps because it had fewer
features and was designed by someone with more of the perspective of a computer
user than a wireless networking engineer. Maybe I'm looking on Wireless Zero
with rose-colored glasses but my recollection is that several people I knew
sincerely struggled to use WiFi. The fix was to remove whatever garbage their
network adapter vendor had provided and show them Wireless Zero, where
connecting to a network meant clicking on it in a list rather than going
through a five-step wizard.</p>
<p>So why did the vendor utilities even exist? Mostly, I think, because of the
incredible urge PC vendors have to "add value."
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CathodeRayDude">Gravis</a>, in the context of "quick
start" operating systems, gives a good explanation of this phenomenon. The
problem with being a PC vendor is that all of the products on the market offer
a mostly identical experience. For vendors to get any competitive moat bigger
than loud industrial design (remember when you badly wanted a Vaio for the
looks?), they had to "add value" by bolting on something they had developed
internally. These value-adds were, almost without exception, worthless
garbage. And wireless configuration utilities were just another example, a way
for Intel to put their brand in front of your face (seemingly the main concern
of Intel R&amp;D to this day) despite doing the same thing everyone else did.</p>
<p>There was a second reason, as well. While it was a good fit for typical
consumer use, Wireless Zero was not as feature-complete as many of the vendor
utilities were. Until the release of Vista and SP3, Wireless Zero was basically
its own proprietary solution just like the vendor utilities. There was no
standard API to interact with wireless configuration on XP/SP1/2, so if a
vendor wanted to offer anything Zero couldn't do, they had to ship their whole
own Product. Microsoft's introduction of a WiFi config API in Vista (and
basically backporting it to SP3) was a big blow to proprietary wireless
utilities, but it probably had less of an impact than the general decline of
crapware in Vista and later.</p>
<p>This is not to say that they're gone. A surprising number of PCs still ship
with some kind of inane OEM software suite that offers a half-baked wireless
configuration utility (just a frontend on the Windows API) alongside the
world's worst backup service, a free trial offer for a streaming service you
haven't heard of but represents the death throes of a once great national cable
network, and something that tells you if your PC is "healthy" based on
something about the registry that has never and will never impact your life???
God how is the PC industry <em>still</em> like this [3].</p>
<p>I think I have adequately set the stage for our featured story. In the late
2000s, huge numbers of people were (a) desperately looking for a working WiFi
network even though they were in a place like an airport that should clearly,
by civilized standards, have a free one; (b) using Wireless Zero on XP/SP1/2;
and (c) in possession of only a vague understanding of ad-hoc networks which
were nonetheless actively encouraged by WiFi vendors and their software.</p>
<p>Oh, there is a final ingredient: Wireless Zero had an interesting behavior
around ad-hoc networks. It's the kind of thing that sounds like an incredibly
bad decision in retrospect, but I can see how Microsoft got there. Let's say
that, for some reason and some how, a consumer uses ad-hoc WiFi. It was
ostensibly possible, not even really that hard, to use ad-hoc WiFi to provide
internet access in a home (from e.g. a USB DSL modem, still common at the
time). It's just that the boxes you had to check were enough clicks deep in the
network control panel that I doubt many people ever got there.</p>
<p>One of the problems with ad-hoc WiFi, though, is that ad-hoc networks can be
annoying to join. You've got to enter the SSID and key, which is already bad
enough, but then you're going to be asked if it's WEP or WPA or WPA2 and then,
insult on injury, if the WPA2 is in TKIP or AES mode. For ad-hoc networks to be
usable <em>something</em> had to broadcast beacons, and without an AP, that had to be
the first computer in the network.</p>
<p>So, now that you have your working ad-hoc setup complete with beacons, you
might want to take your laptop, unplug it from the DSL modem, and take it
somewhere else. Maybe you go on a trip, use the WiFi at a hotel (probably $15 a
day depending on your <em>WORLD OF HYATT</em> status), then come back home and plug
things back in the way they were. You would expect your home internet setup to
pick up where you left off, but people didn't have as many devices back then
and especially not as many always-on. Your laptop, de facto "host" of the
ad-hoc network, may be the only network participant up and running when you
want to connect a new device. So what does it need to do? Transmit beacons
again, even though the network configuration has changed a few times.</p>
<p>The problem is that it's really hard for a system in an ad-hoc network to know
whether or not it should advertise it. Wireless Zero didn't really provide any
way to surface this decision to the user, and the user probably wouldn't have
understood what it meant anyway. So Microsoft took what probably seemed, in the
naivety of the day, to be a reasonable approach: once a Windows XP machine had
connected to an ad-hoc network, it "remembered" it the same way it did the
"favorite" networks, for automatic reconnection. Assuming that it might just be
the first device in the ad-hoc network to come up, if the machine had a
remembered ad-hoc network and wasn't associated with anything else, it would
transmit beacons.</p>
<p>Put another way, this behavior sounds far more problematic: if a Windows XP
machine had an ad-hoc network favorited (which would be default if it had ever
connected to one), then when it wasn't connected to any other WiFi network, it
would beacon the favorited ad-hoc network to make it easier for other hosts to
connect. Ad-hoc networks could get <em>stuck in there,</em> a ghost in Wireless Zero.</p>
<p>You can no doubt see where this goes. "Free Public WiFi" was just some ad-hoc
network that someone created once. We don't know why; most people seem to go to
ill intent but I don't think that's necessary. Maybe some well-meaning cafe
owner had an old computer with a USB DSL modem they used for Business and
decided to offer cafe WiFi with the hardware they already owned. The easiest
way (and probably only way, given that driver support for infrastructure mode
AP behavior on computer WiFi adapters remains uneven today) would be to create
an ad-hoc network and check the right boxes to enable forwarding. But who knows,
maybe it was someone intercepting traffic for malicious purposes, maybe it was
someone playing a joke, all we really know is that it happened sometime before
2006 when I find the first public reference to the phenomenon.</p>
<p>Whoever it was, they were patient zero. The first Windows XP machine to connect
became infected, and when its owner took it somewhere else and didn't connect
to a WiFi network, it helpfully beaconed Free Public WiFi. Someone else, seeing
such a promising network name, connected. Frustrated by the lack of Hotmail
access, they disconnected and moved on... but, unknowingly, they were now part
of The Ad-Hoc Network.</p>
<p>The phenomenon must have spread quickly. In 2007, a wire service column of
security tips (attributed to the Better Business Bureau, noted information
security experts) warns that "this network may be an ad-hoc network used by
hackers hunting for credit card information, Social Security numbers and
account passwords." Maybe! Stranger things have happened! I would put good
money on "no" (the same article encourages using a VPN, an early link in a
chain that leads to the worst YouTube content today).</p>
<p>By 2008-2009, when I think I had reached a high level of owning a laptop and
using it in strange places, it was almost universal. "Free Public WiFi"
enchanted me as a teenager because it was <em>everywhere.</em> I could hardly open my
laptop without seeing it there in the Wireless Zero list. Like the Morris worm,
it exploited a behavior so widespread and so unprotected that I think it must
have burned through a substantial portion of the Windows XP laptop fleet.</p>
<p>"Free Public WiFi" would reach an end. In Service Pack 3, as part of the
introduction of the new WLAN framework, Microsoft fixed the beacon behavior.
This was before the era of forced updates, though, and XP was particularly
notorious for slow uptake of service packs. "Free Public WiFi" was apparently
still widespread in 2010 when NPR's mention inspired a wave of news coverage.
Anecdotally, I think I remember seeing it into 2012. One wonders: is it still
around today?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I always have a hard time with large-scale research on WiFi
networks. WiGLE makes a tantalizing offer of an open data set to answer this
kind of question but the query interface is much too limited and the API has a
prohibitively low quota. Maxing out my API limits every day I think it'd take
over a month to extract all the "Free Public WiFi" records so that I could
filter them the way I want to. Perhaps I should make a sales inquiry for a
commercial account for my enterprise blogging needs, but it's just never felt
to me like WiGLE is actually a good resource for the security community.
They're kind of like hoarders, they have an incredible wealth of data but they
don't want to give any of it up.</p>
<p>I pulled the few thousand records I'm allowed to get today from WiGLE and then
changed tracks to WifiDB, which is much less known than WiGLE but actually
makes the data available. Unfortunately WifiDB has a much lower user count, and
so the data is clearly impacted by collection bias (namely the impressive work
of one specific contributor in Phoenix, AZ).</p>
<p>Still, I can find instances of ad-hoc "Free Public WiFi" spanning 2006 to as
late as 2018! It's hard to know what's going on there. I would seriously
consider beaconing "Free Public WiFi" today as a joke, but it may be that in
2018 there was still some XP SP2 laptop in the Phoenix area desperately hoping
for internet access.</p>
<p>WifiDB data, limited though it is, suggests that The Ad-Hoc Network peaked in
2010. Why not a crude visualization?</p>
<pre><code>2006    1   |
2007    0   
2008    39  |||||
2009    82  |||||||||

2016    3   |
2017    2   |
2018    1   |
</code></pre>
<p>That 2006 detection is the first, which lines up with NPR's reporting, but
could easily also be an artifact of WifiDB's collection. And 2018! The long
tail on this is impressive, but not all that surprising. XP had a real
reputation for its staying power. There are surely still people out there that
hold that XP was the last truly good Windows release---and honestly I might be
one of them. Every end-of-life announcement for XP triggered a wave of
complaints in the industry rags. In 2018, some niche versions of XP (e.g.
POSReady) were still under security support!</p>
<p>Most recent observations of "Free Public WiFi" are actually infrastructure-mode
networks. It's an amusing outcome that "Free Public WiFi" has been legitimized
over time. In Bloomington, Indiana I think it's actually the public WiFi at a
government building. Some office buildings and gas stations make appearances.
"Free Public WiFi" is probably more likely to work today than not... but no
guarantee that it won't steal your credit card. Pay heed to the Better Business
Bureau and take caution. Consider using a VPN... how about a word from our
sponsor?</p>
<p>Postscript: I have been uploading some YouTube videos! None of them are good,
but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOtVj3FON727juFaSDEZUXw">check it out</a>.
I'm about to record another one, about burglar alarms.</p>
<p>[1] Paid WiFi still seems alive and well at truck stops. Circumstances on a
recent cross-country trip lead to me paying an outrageous sum, something like
$20, for one day of access to a nationwide truck stop WiFi service that was
somewhere between "completely broken" and "barely usable to send an email" at
the three successive TAs I tried at. My original goal of downloading a
several-GiB file was eventually achieved by eating at a restaurant proximate to
a Motel 6. Motel 6 may be the nation's leading municipal WiFi operator.</p>
<p>[2] Can we think of another set of powerful hardware vendors consistently
dragging down the (already questionably seaworthy) Windows ecosystem by
shipping just absolute trash software that's mandatory for full use of their
hardware? Companies that are considered major centers of computer innovation
yet distribute a "driver" as an installer for an installer that takes over a
minute just to install the installer? Someone with the gall to call their
<em>somehow even less stable</em> release branch "ADRENALINE EDITION"?</p>
<p>[3] I used to have a ThinkPad with an extra button that did nothing because
Lenovo decided not to support the utility that made it do things on Vista or
later. This laptop was sold well after the release of Vista and I think shipped
with 7. That situation existed on certain ThinkPad models for <em>two
generations.</em> Things like this drive you to the edge of the Apple Store I
swear, and Lenovo isn't as bad as some.</p>
