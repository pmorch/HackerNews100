<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Back in 2009 Tim Berners-Lee drafted a web-specification for "Socially Aware Cloud Storage":</p><blockquote>There is an architecture in which a few existing or Web protocols are gathered together with some glue to make a world wide system in which applications (desktop or web application) can work on top of a layer of commodity read-write storage.<p>Crucial design issues are that principals (users) and groups are identifies by URIs, and so are global in scope, and that elements of storage are access controlled using those global identifiers. The result is that storage becomes a commodity, independent of the application running on it.</p></blockquote><figure><a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/CloudStorage.html"><div><p>Socially aware cloud storage - Design Issues</p><p><img src="https://www.w3.org/favicon.ico" alt=""></p></div><p><img src="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/diagrams/social/simondseconoart-small.png" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>Several of these ideas were going around in the late 2000s, shortly after the explosive growth of "web2" monoliths like Facebook.</p><p>Another spiritually similar idea being championed at the time came from the Opera browser folks who wanted to put <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2009/06/opera-hoping-to-reinvent-the-web-by-making-browser-a-server/">"a web server in your browser"</a>.</p><p>While 'Opera Unite' never fully materialized, Tim's spec got significant traction some years down the road as one privacy crisis after another made the case for stronger web agency self-evident.</p><p>In 2015 Tim &amp; co. <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/web-inventor-tim-berners-lees-next-project-platform-gives-users-control-their-data" rel="noreferrer">secured some funding for the Solid Protocol</a>.</p><blockquote>Right now we have the worst of both worlds, in which people not only cannot control their data, but also can’t really use it, due to it being spread across a number of different silo-ed websites. Our goal is to develop a web architecture that gives users ownership over their data, including the freedom to switch to new applications in search of better features, pricing, and policies.”</blockquote><figure><a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/04/tim-berners-lee-inventor-web-plots-radical-overhaul-creation/"><div><p>Tim Berners-Lee, Inventor of the Web, Plots a Radical Overhaul of His Creation</p><p>The creator of the web just received the equivalent of the Nobel Prize for computing.

For example, social networks would still run in the cloud. But you could store your data locally. Alternately, you could choose a different cloud server run by a company or community you trust. <p>You might have different servers for different types of information—for health and fitness data, say—that is completely separate from the one you use for financial records.</p></blockquote><p>To this day, Tim continues to eloquently champion <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/28/why-i-gave-the-world-wide-web-away-for-free">the virtues of the Solid vision</a>.</p><blockquote>We have the technical capability to give that power back to the individual. Solid is an open-source interoperable standard that I and my team developed at MIT more than a decade ago. Apps running on Solid don’t implicitly own your data – they have to request it from you and you choose whether to agree, or not. Rather than being in countless separate places on the internet in the hands of whomever it had been resold to, your data is in one place, controlled by you.<p>Sharing your information in a smart way can also liberate it. Why is your smartwatch writing your biological data to one silo in one format? Why is your credit card writing your financial data to a second silo in a different format? Why are your YouTube comments, Reddit posts, Facebook updates and tweets all stored in different places? Why is the default expectation that you aren’t supposed to be able to look at any of this stuff? <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2009/06/opera-hoping-to-reinvent-the-web-by-making-browser-a-server/">You generate all this data – your actions, your choices, your body, your preferences, your decisions. You should own it. You should be empowered&nbsp;by it.</a></p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://solidproject.org/">Solid Protocol</a> remains an excellent idea and has even culminated in an official <a href="https://www.w3.org/2024/09/linked-web-storage-wg-charter.html">web specification</a>, but Solid has not yet amounted to any mainstream adoption on the web. Its primary financial sponsor <a href="https://www.inrupt.com/" rel="noreferrer">Inrupt</a> (of which Tim is co-founder &amp; CTO) has focused on the enterprise market as a path to sustainability; it remains to be seen what resources will be directed towards web-scale adoption of Solid.</p><p>Thankfully those of us who want data ownership and agency in our web applications <em>now</em> don't have to wait. <a href="https://atproto.com/" rel="noreferrer">AT Protocol</a> was ushered in by the folks at <a href="https://bsky.social/" rel="noreferrer">Bluesky</a>, now with a network of over 30M people strong and increasingly spread across multiple federated platforms/communities like <a href="https://blackskyweb.xyz/" rel="noreferrer">Blacksky</a> or <a href="https://tangled.org/">Tangled</a>.</p><p>While the respective architectures of the <em>Solid </em>and <em>AT </em>protocols are quite different, they're pointing to the same Open Social Web, re-built on the principles of user-sovereign data storage.</p><p>What web-user sovereignty looks like in practice, from the vantage point of atproto, has been expertly illustrated by <a href="https://danabra.mov/">danabra.mov</a></p><figure><a href="https://overreacted.io/open-social/"><div><p>Open Social — overreacted</p><p>The protocol is the API.</p><p><img src="https://overreacted.io/icon.png?e0852c1e2c7f0e65" alt=""></p></div><p><img src="https://overreacted.io/open-social/opengraph-image?5b0b970dfd19bb8c" alt=""></p></a></figure><blockquote>Notice that Alice’s handle is now <code>@alice.com</code>. It is not allocated by a social media company [like facebook.com/alice]. Rather, her handle is <em>the</em> universal “internet handle”, i.e. a domain. Alice <em>owns</em> the <code>alice.com</code> domain, so she can <em>use it as a handle</em> on any open social app. (On most open social apps, she goes by <code>@alice.com</code>, but for others she wants a distinct disconnected identity, so she owns another handle she’d rather not share.)<p>Bob owns a domain too, even though he isn’t technical. He might not even know what a “domain” is. Bob just thinks of <code>@bob.com</code> as his “internet handle”. Some open social apps will offer you a free subdomain on registration, just like Gmail gives you a free Gmail address, or may offer an extra flow for buying a domain. You’re not locked into your first choice, and can swap to a different domain later.</p><p>(...) With open social, Alice’s data—her posts, likes, follows, etc—<em>is</em> hosted on the web itself. Alongside her personal site, Alice now has a <em>personal repository</em> of her data.</p></blockquote><p>This new paradigm is made technically possible by what the AT protocol refers to as a <a href="https://atproto.wiki/en/wiki/reference/core-architecture/pds" rel="noreferrer">Personal Data Server</a> or PDS for short (what Solid calls a <a href="https://solidproject.org/faq#pod">Pod</a>).</p><p>The notion of a 'PDS' quickly comes off as something very technical and nerdy which is why it's not mentioned once in Dan's explainer, even though it's still targeted at an audience of <em>web nerds</em>. But really the only obscure word here is the <em>Server</em>, which in this context is interchangeable with <em>Storage</em>, as in Personal Data Storage.</p><p>Even regular internet users have some mental model of what personalized data storage entails, especially with the complementary framing of <em>collectively owned and operated</em> data storage.</p><h2 id="data-banking-coops">Data-banking Coops</h2><p>If you're a regular internet user the PDS paradigm won't move your data from the cloud to your personal computer. Most people will still rely on an institutional cloud service, but instead of data-banking with a shareholder-controlled corporation most people’s data can be entrusted to the equivalent of member-owned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_union">credit unions</a> for data storage.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.muni.town/content/images/2025/09/IMG_2977.jpeg" alt="As the economy was transformed by industrialization and then by consumer banking, powerful new players such as Standard Oil, J.P. Morgan, and a handful of others threatened the freedom of citizens. In order to provide a counterweight to these new powers, citizens joined together to form trade unions and cooperative banking institutions, which were federally chartered to represent their members’ interests. These citizen organizations helped balance the economic and social power between large and small players and between employers and worker. The same collective organization is required to move from an individualized asset-based understanding of data control to a collective system based on rights and accountability, with legal standards upheld by a new class of representatives who act as fiduciaries for their members. In the U.S. almost 100 million people are members of credit unions, not-for-profit institutions owned by their members, and already chartered to securely manage their members’ digital data and to represent them in a wide variety of financial transactions, including insurance, investments, and benefits. The question then is, could we apply the same push for citizen power to the area of data rights in the ever-growing digital economy?" loading="lazy" width="1418" height="643" srcset="https://blog.muni.town/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/IMG_2977.jpeg 600w, https://blog.muni.town/content/images/size/w1000/2025/09/IMG_2977.jpeg 1000w, https://blog.muni.town/content/images/2025/09/IMG_2977.jpeg 1418w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Source: </span><a href="https://ide.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Data-Cooperatives-final.pdf" rel="noreferrer"><span>https://ide.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Data-Cooperatives-final.pdf</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>One in every three US adults banks with a Credit Union. Achieving similar or better numbers for data storage is far from inconceivable considering how much our collective experience with Big Banking mirrors that of Big Tech/Social.</p><p>The concept of <a href="https://www.cip.org/blog/data-cooperatives" rel="noreferrer">data cooperatives</a> has already gained a lot of traction in the fediverse with several providers like <a href="https://social.coop/">social.coop</a>, <a href="https://data.coop/">data.coop</a> and <a href="https://cosocial.ca/">cosocial.ca</a> being operational for many years and still going strong. Soon the AT network will have a similarly co-owned institution in <a href="https://northskysocial.com/" rel="noreferrer">Northsky</a>.</p><p>Whether these providers are strictly cooperatives in the formal sense isn't what's most important here though; any suffuciently transparent, democratic and community-oriented data bank (like the aforementioned Blacksky, or the forthcoming Eurosky) is a valid steward and co-creator of an Open Social.</p><p>Data Ownership as a conversation changes when data resides primarily with people-governed institutions rather than corporations. Rather than arguing for what kinds of data we <em>ought to be</em> able to download from the corporate silos, the platforms should be asking us what kinds of data they may copy from <em>our servers</em>, and only with strictly temporary allowances.</p><p>And while the separation of user data and social platform is most fully realized today in the AT network, there are exciting signs of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">cross-pollination happening</a> in the ongoing development of atproto’s predecessor <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a>. I hope to see similar openness towards technological convergence in Solid for a more <a href="https://writings.thisismissem.social/statement-on-discourse-about-activitypub-and-at-protocol/" rel="noreferrer">pluralistic social web</a>.</p><p>Personal Data Storage has long since escaped containment as a concept pertaining to any specific protocol. Some implementations of it will be more mainstream than others, but pragmatic data coops can be protocol-agnostic and storage formats are transmutable.</p><p>As long as we have sufficient control of our own data there will always be a way to restart our social graph and digital presence elsewhere in the event of platform collapse.

					<h2>Social Cooling is a name for the <em>long-term negative side effects</em> of living in a reputation economy:</h2>
					
					<div>
							<h3>1. A culture of conformity</h3>
							<p>Have you ever hesitated to click&nbsp;on a link because you thought your visit might be logged, and it could look bad?</p>
							<p>More and more people feel this pressure, and they are starting to apply self-censorship.
						</p></div>
				</div>
			<div>
							<h3>2. A culture of risk-aversion</h3>
							<div><p>When doctors in New York were given scores this had unexpected results.</p><p>
							
							Doctors that tried to help advanced cancer patients had a higher mortality rate, which translated into a lower score.</p></div>
							<p>Doctors that didn't try to help were rewarded with high scores, even though their patients died prematurely.</p>
							<p><em>Rating systems can create unwanted incentives, and increase pressure to conform to a bureaucratic average.</em></p>
						</div>
			<div>
							<h3>3. Increased social rigidity</h3>
							<p>Digital reputation systems are limiting our ability and our will to protest injustice.</p>
							<p>In China each adult citizen is getting a government mandated "<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-34592186">social credit score</a>". This represents how well behaved they are, and is based on crime records,&nbsp;what they say on social media, what they buy,&nbsp;and even the scores of their friends.</p>
							<p>If you have a low score you can't get a government job, visa, cheap loan, or even a nice online date.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>I</span>t’s not just you. The internet is getting worse, fast. The services we rely on, that we once loved? They’re all turning into piles of shit, all at once. Ask any Facebook user who has to scroll past 10 screens of engagement-bait, AI slop and surveillance ads just to get to one post by the people they are on the service to communicate with. This is infuriating. Frustrating. And, depending on how important those services are to you, <em>terrifying</em>.</p><p>In 2022, I coined a term to describe the sudden-onset platform collapse going on all around us: <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/nov/26/enshittification-macquarie-dictionary-word-of-the-year-explained" data-link-name="in body link">enshittification</a></em>. To my bittersweet satisfaction, that word is doing big&nbsp;numbers. In fact, it has achieved escape velocity. It&nbsp;isn’t&nbsp;just a way to say something got worse. It’s an analysis that explains the way an online service gets worse, how that worsening unfolds, and the contagion that’s causing everything to get worse, all at once.</p><p>This moment we’re living through, this Great Enshittening, is a material phenomenon, much like a disease, with symptoms, a mechanism and an epidemiology. When doctors observe patients who are sick with a novel pathogen, their first order of business is creating a natural history of the disease. This natural history is an ordered catalogue of the disease’s progress: what symptoms do patients exhibit, and in which order?</p><p>Here’s the natural history of enshittification:<br><strong>1</strong> First, platforms are good to their users.<br><strong>2</strong> Then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers.<br><strong>3</strong> Next, they abuse those customers to claw back all the value for themselves – and become a giant pile of shit.</p><p>This pattern is everywhere. Once you learn about it, you’ll start seeing it, too. Take <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon" data-link-name="in body link">Amazon</a>, a company that started out by making it possible to have any book shipped to your door and then became the only game in town for everything else, even as it dodged taxes and filled up with self-immolating crapgadgets and other junk.</p><p>In Jeff Bezos’s original business plan for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Amazon</a>, the company was called Relentless. Critics say that this is a reference to Bezos’s cutthroat competitive instincts, but Bezos always insisted that it was a reference to his company’s relentless commitment to customer service.</p><p>How did Amazon go from a logistics company that got packages to you quickly and efficiently to a behemoth of digital content defined by the Prime experience (which has much less to do with free shipping now and more with everything else)?</p><hr><h2 id="stage-1-good-to-users"><strong>Stage </strong><strong>1: good to </strong><strong>users</strong></h2><p>Amazon started with a large surplus of cash that it was able to allocate to its customers, and allocate it did. The company raised a fortune from early investors, then a larger fortune by listing on the stock market. Then it used that fortune to subsidise many goods, selling them below cost. It also subsidised shipping and offered a no-questions-asked, postage-paid returns policy.</p><p>This offer tempted millions of users to pile on to the platform. Once they were there, Prime membership went a long way to locking them in. Paying for shipping a year in advance is a powerful incentive to do your shopping on Amazon. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of Prime subscribers begin their e-commerce searches on Amazon and, if they find what they’re looking for, don’t shop around for a better deal.</p><p>You can think of Prime as a form of soft lock-in, Amazon binding you to its platform with a silken ribbon. But Amazon’s also got some iron chains in its toolbox. All the audiobooks and movies, and most of the ebooks and emagazines, you buy from Amazon are permanently locked to its platform.</p><p>They are sold with digital rights management (DRM), a form of encryption designed to force you to view or listen using apps that Amazon controls. Break up with Amazon and delete your apps, and you will lose all the media you’ve ever bought from the platform. For a certain kind of reader, listener or movie buff, this is a very high switching cost indeed.</p><p>Amazon has one more trick up its sleeve: after years of selling goods below cost, it has completed the work that big box stores started, eliminating swaths of small, independent, brick-and-mortar businesses. Its online predatory pricing tactics have done the same for much of the e-commerce world.</p><p>That means shopping anywhere other than Amazon has become substantially more inconvenient. These tactics – Prime, DRM and predatory pricing – make it very hard <em>not</em> to shop at Amazon. With users locked in, to proceed with the enshittification playbook,&nbsp;Amazon needed to get its business customers locked in, too.</p><hr><h2 id="stage-2-abusing-users-good-to-businesses"><strong>Stage </strong><strong>2: abusing users, good to business</strong><strong>es</strong></h2><p>Amazon was initially very good to those business customers. It paid full price for their goods, then sold them below cost to its customers. It subsidised returns and customer service, too. It ran a clean search engine, which put the best matches for shoppers’ queries at the top of the page, creating a path to glory merchants could walk merely by selling quality goods at fair prices.</p><p>Then, once those merchants were locked in, Amazon put the screws on them. Amazon brags about this technique, which it calls “the flywheel”. It brings in users with low prices and a large selection. This attracts merchants who are eager to sell to those users. The merchants’ dependence on those customers allows Amazon to extract higher discounts from those merchants, and that brings in more users, which makes the platform even more indispensable for merchants, allowing the company to require even deeper discounts – and around and around the flywheel spins.</p><p>Let’s take a step back. This flywheel is the direct product of a radical legal theory that has had the world in its grip since the late 1970s. From the 1890s until the Jimmy Carter administration, US corporations’ power was blunted by antitrust law, which treated large companies as threats <em>simply because they were large</em>. Once a company is too big to fail, it becomes too big to jail, and then too big to care. Antitrust law was designed to fight that apathy and force companies to care.</p><p>A rival – and frankly terrible – theory of antitrust law says that the only time a government should intervene against a monopolist is when it is sure that the monopolist is using its scale to raise prices or lower quality. This is the consumer welfare standard theory and its premise is that when we find monopolies in the wild, they are almost certainly large and powerful thanks to the quality of their offerings. Any time you find that people all buy the same goods from the same store, you should assume that this is the very best store, selling the very best goods. It would be perverse (goes the theory) for the government to harass companies for being so excellent that everyone loves them.</p><p>It was under this theory that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jimmy-carter" data-link-name="in body link">Jimmy Carter</a> started to remove a few of the Jenga blocks from the antitrust system. Then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ronald-reagan" data-link-name="in body link">Ronald Reagan</a> came along and tore them out by the fistful. (Most of the rightwing policies for which we remember Reagan <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2023/04/27/much-of-ronald-reagans-presidency-was-foreshadowed-by-jimmy-carters-policies/" data-link-name="in body link">started under Carter</a>, who was hoping to woo conservative voters. He failed.) Every president since – Republican or Democrat – has followed Reagan’s example, up to (but not including) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden" data-link-name="in body link">Joe Biden</a>.</p><p>The Amazon flywheel is designed to fit neatly into the consumer welfare framework. It proclaims itself to be an enemy to merchants on behalf of consumers. The flywheel is all about lowering prices, and the consumer welfare standard theory prizes low prices above all else.</p><hr><h2 id="stage-3-a-giant-pile-of-shit"><strong>Stage </strong><strong>3: a giant pile of shit</strong></h2><p>Amazon has a myriad of tactics at its disposal for shifting value from business customers to itself, some of which also involve shifting value away from end users, no matter what the cute flywheel pitch says.</p><p>It uses its overview of merchants’ sales, as well as its ability to observe the return addresses on direct shipments from merchants’ contracting factories, to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/07/independent-uk-retailers-claim-1bn-damages-against-amazon" data-link-name="in body link">cream off its merchants’ bestselling items and clone them</a>, relegating the original seller to page umpty-million of its search results.</p><p>Amazon also crushes its merchants under a mountain of junk fees pitched as optional but effectively mandatory. Take Prime: a merchant has to give up a huge share of each sale to be included in Prime, and merchants that don’t use Prime are pushed so far down in the search results, they might as well cease to exist.</p><p>Same with <a href="https://sell.amazon.co.uk/fulfilment-by-amazon?ld=SEUKFBAAdGog-Top-Kwds_14921146748_129850349469_kwd-23792740295_e_565464207487_c_sig-Cj0KCQjw_rPGBhCbARIsABjq9cerrKp9B1eCyx3wzgQTJzVZozgQC7258a5neee6dQ9lMOd6qf4PaK4aAgfiEALw_wcB_asret_&amp;amp;id=go_cmp-14921146748_adg-129850349469_ad-565464207487_kwd-23792740295_devc_ext-_prd-" data-link-name="in body link">Fulfilment by Amazon</a>, a “service” in which a merchant sends its items to an Amazon warehouse to be packed and delivered with Amazon’s own inventory. This is far more expensive than comparable (or superior) shipping services from rival logistics companies, and a merchant that ships through one of those rivals is, again, relegated even farther down the search rankings.</p><p>All told, Amazon makes so much money charging merchants to deliver the wares they sell through the platform that its own shipping is fully subsidised. In other words, Amazon gouges its merchants so much that it pays nothing to ship its own goods, which compete directly with those merchants’ goods.</p><p>Here’s where Amazon’s attacks on its merchants’ bottom lines turn into higher prices for its customers. A merchant that pays Amazon through the nose needs to make up the money somewhere. Hypothetically, merchants could eat Amazon’s fees themselves – in other words, if Amazon wants a 10% fee on an item with a 20% profit margin, the seller could split the difference, and settle for a 10% profit.</p><p>But Amazon’s fee isn’t 10%. Add all the junk fees together and an Amazon seller is being screwed out of 45-51 cents on every dollar it earns there. Even if it wanted to absorb the “Amazon tax” on your behalf, it couldn’t. Merchants just don’t make 51% margins.</p><p>So merchants must jack up prices, which they do. A lot. Now, you may have noticed that Amazon’s prices aren’t any higher than the prices that you pay elsewhere. There’s a good reason for that: when merchants raise their prices on Amazon, they are required to raise their prices everywhere else, even on their own direct-sales stores. This arrangement is called most-favoured-nation status, and it’s key to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/26/amazon-antitrust-lawsuit-analysis-big-tech" data-link-name="in body link">US Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust lawsuit against Amazon</a>.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-34">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-34" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Let the implications of most-favoured nation settle in. If Amazon is taxing merchants 45-51 cents on every dollar they make, and if merchants are hiking their prices everywhere their goods are sold, then it follows you’re paying the Amazon tax no matter where you shop – even the corner mom-and-pop hardware store.</p><p>It gets worse. On average, the first result in an Amazon search is 29% more expensive than the best match for your search. Click any of the top four links on the top of your screen and you’ll pay an average of 25% more than you would for your best match – which, on average, is located 17 places down in an Amazon search result.</p><p>Why does this happen? Because Amazon makes more than <em>$</em><em>50b</em><em>n every year</em> charging merchants for search placement. When you search for a product on Amazon, the top results aren’t the best matches: they’re the matches that pay the highest fees to Amazon to be top of the list.</p><p>Researchers Rory Van Loo and Nikita Aggarwal call this “<a href="https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/3645/" data-link-name="in body link">Amazon’s pricing paradox</a>”. Amazon gets to insist that it has the lowest prices in the business, but no one can find those prices. Instead, we all pay a massive Amazon tax every time we shop there, <em>and</em> the merchants we buy from are paying an Amazon tax, too.</p><p>That means that, on average, the stuff at the top of an Amazon search results page is <em>bad</em>. It’s low-quality, high-priced junk. Even when you’re buying a known quantity, such as a specific brand of AA batteries, the top item will usually be more expensive than the items lower down on the page – the ones without the splashy banners advertising “Best Seller” or “Amazon’s Choice”. The Amazon smile logo gets a lot more sinister when it appears next to a top search result that costs 29% more than the best match for your query, thanks to Amazon’s $50bn-a-year paid search placement.</p><p>Not that you can find lower prices through anything as simple as sorting your search results by price. The merchants that dominate the search listings will play games with quantity to have the result with the lowest price, even if the price per unit is much higher. For example, a four-pack of AAs priced at $3.99 is more expensive per battery than a 16-pack priced at $10 (ie $1 versus $0.63), but sort-by-lowest-price will bury the better deal on the third or fourth page of results.</p><p>This is only the beginning. Amazon has clawed back value from buyers and sellers in many more ways. It underinvests in anti-fraud, so the top-scoring items with the highest user ratings are often terrible but are garlanded with (paid) rave reviews. Merchants with high-quality offerings are faced with two bad options: either they sink to the bottom of the rankings, or they cheat, too. If they <em>do</em> cheat, they’ll have to raise the prices of their merchandise in order to pay for the specialised fraud-as-a-service scum who gin up all those fake reviews. Then, if they get caught, they’ll be banished from Amazon and either go bust or have to start all over again under a new business name.</p><p>But for Amazon, all of this is fine. It’s how its system works, its flywheel. Amazon makes money when you are satisfied, and when you’re furious. The costs are borne by sellers, and by you. Why <em>would</em> the company invest in fighting fraud under those circumstances?</p><p>That’s also why Amazon puts so little effort into policing rotten sellers – and why so many of the “brands” there are consonant-heavy nonsense strings, seemingly generated at random by fly-by-nights that pop up and disappear, then pop up again under a new name.</p><p>This is end-stage enshittification. Amazon locked in its customers, then squeeeeezed, counting on a few good, desperate sellers to keep the system going. Then it clawed value away from its good sellers, leaving behind bad sellers that are a further source of misery for us.</p><p>Now Amazon is in the terminal stage. We’re all still stuck to the platform, but we get less and less value out of it. And because we’re all still there, buying Prime and starting (and ending) our purchase planning with Amazon’s enshittified search results, the merchants who rely on selling to us are stuck there, too, earning less and less from every sale.</p><p>The platform has turned into a pile of shit, and we’re at the bottom of it.</p><hr><p><span>A</span> confession: I am no true believer in markets as the best arbiter of how our society should work, who should be in charge of it and how its productive capacity should be organised. Like other leftists, I am deeply suspicious of capitalism. I understand the temptation to look at all this verbiage about enshittification, throw your hands up and say, “What do you expect? Capitalism always produces crises of production. Enshittification is just a sweary euphemism for capitalism.”</p><p>But this is wrong. There are meaningful differences between the internet as it stands today – the enshitternet – and the old, good internet we once had. The enshitternet is a source of pain, precarity and immiseration for the people we love. The indignities of harassment, scams, disinformation, surveillance, wage theft, extraction and rent-seeking have always been with us, but they were a minor sideshow on the old, good internet and they are the everything and all of the enshitternet.</p><p>This has real, material consequences for our comrades in the struggle for a better world. The internet that spawned <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy" data-link-name="in body link">Occupy</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement" data-link-name="in body link">Black Lives Matter </a>has become hostile to the maintenance of radical political movements and is inimical to the founding of new ones. That really matters. Not because the internet is the most important issue facing us today. Far from it. Compared with the climate emergency, genocide, inequality, corruption, democratic backsliding, authoritarianism and sustained racist, homophobic, misogynist and transphobic attacks, the internet is just a sideshow. But the internet is the terrain upon which these fights will be waged. It is the communications medium we will use to organise to save our species and planet from their imminent eradication. We can’t win these fights without a free, fair and open internet.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/18/my-hero-audre-lorde-jackie-kay" data-link-name="in body link">Audre Lorde</a> was far smarter than I am about nearly everything, but when she wrote, “<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/audre-lorde-the-master-s-tools-will-never-dismantle-the-master-s-house" data-link-name="in body link">The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house</a>”, she was manifestly wrong. The master’s tools were used to build that house in the first place – that makes them the ideal tools to take it to bits and rebuild it to shelter us.</p><p>We can halt the creeping enshittification of every digital device. We can build a better, enshittification-resistant digital nervous system, one fit to coordinate the mass movements we will need to fight fascism, end genocide and save our planet and our species.</p><figure id="d30261f5-99f3-45df-9c5e-0edbb4e70d5f" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:54,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;‘My house filled with stuff while my bank account drained’: how I stopped impulse buying&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;d30261f5-99f3-45df-9c5e-0edbb4e70d5f&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/feb/27/how-to-stop-impulse-buying&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>You won’t be able to do it alone. Your personal consumption choices might make a difference to the merchants you patronise, but they have no effect on the policies that created our enshittogenic environment. Just as you can’t save the planet by diligently sorting your recycling, you can’t stop enshittification by “voting with your wallet” (those votes are always won by those with the thickest wallets, and that’s the billionaires who made money by enshittifying everything).</p><p>Take Amazon: to fix Amazon, we need policy solutions. We need to ban predatory pricing – selling goods below cost to keep competitors out of the market (and then jacking them up again). We need to impose structural separation on the company so it can either be a platform, or compete with the sellers that rely on it as a platform. We need to curb its junk fees, which suck 45-51 cents on every dollar merchants take in. We need to end its most favoured nation deal, which forces merchants who raise their prices on Amazon to pay these fees to raise their prices everywhere else, too. We need to unionise its drivers and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/amazon-diaries" data-link-name="in body link">warehouse workers</a>. We need to treat its rigged search results as the fraud they are.</p><p>The path to a better Amazon doesn’t lie through consumer activism, or appeals to the its conscience. Corporations, being artificial, immortal colony-organisms that use humans as their inconvenient gut flora, do not have consciences to appeal to. The path leads through coalitions: of consumers and merchants who are tired of being robbed; of workers who are tired of being immiserated and maimed; of competitors who are tired of being strong-armed by a monopolist bully; of tax-justice activists who are tired of trillion-dollar multinationals ducking their obligations. Systemic problems have systemic solutions, not individual ones. You can’t shop your way out of a monopoly.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/martin-luther-king" data-link-name="in body link">Martin Luther King Jr </a>once said, “It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can stop him from lynching me, and I think that’s pretty important, also.”</p><p>It may be true that regulation can’t force corporate sociopaths to conceive of you as a human being entitled to dignity and fair treatment, and not just an ambulatory wallet, a supply of gut bacteria for the immortal colony organism that is a limited liability corporation.

<p>Public awareness of legal sports betting has grown in recent years – and so has the perception that it is a bad thing for society and sports, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.</p>

<p>Today, 43% of U.S. adults say the fact that sports betting is now legal in much of the country is a <strong>bad thing for society. </strong>That’s up from <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/09/14/as-more-states-legalize-the-practice-19-of-u-s-adults-say-they-have-bet-money-on-sports-in-the-past-year/">34% in 2022</a>. And 40% of adults now say it’s a <strong>bad thing for sports,</strong> up from 33%.</p>



<p>Despite these increasingly critical views of legal sports betting, many Americans continue to say it has neither a bad nor good impact on society and on sports. Fewer than one-in-five see positive impacts.</p>



<details><summary>About this research</summary>
<p>This Pew Research Center analysis examines recent changes in Americans’ awareness of, attitudes about and personal experiences with sports betting. It comes as more states <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/events/details/sports-betting-on-the-rise-as-states-let-gamblers-wager-online">legalize the practice</a>.</p>



<h4 id="2c86970a0dfb1a0fb6143626d475626a">Why did we do this?</h4>



<p>The Center conducts high-quality research to inform the public, journalists and decision-makers. Studying the public’s views of and experiences with sports betting is part of our long-standing research on social trends, technology and related topics.</p>

<h4 id="61af5ad1ffc78809f7ec505aec15ab69">How did we do this?</h4>



<p>This analysis is based on findings from a survey of 9,916 U.S. adults who are part of the Center’s American Trends Panel. The survey was conducted from July 8 to Aug. 3, 2025. The survey’s overall margin of error is plus or minus 1.3 percentage points.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the share of Americans who have bet money on sports in the past year has not changed much since 2022.</p>



<p>Today, 22% of adults say they’ve<strong> personally bet money on sports in the past year.</strong> That’s a slight uptick from 19% three years ago. This figure includes betting in any of three ways:</p>



<ul>
<li>With friends or family, such as in a private betting pool, fantasy league or casual bet</li>



<li>Online with a betting app, sportsbook or casino</li>



<li>In person at a casino, racetrack or betting kiosk</li>
</ul>

<p>Commercial sports betting has spread rapidly across the United States since a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/us/politics/supreme-court-sports-betting-new-jersey.html">Supreme Court ruling in 2018</a> gave states the green light to legalize it. At least 38 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico now allow commercial sports betting in some form, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/events/details/sports-betting-on-the-rise-as-states-let-gamblers-wager-online">according to the National Conference of State Legislatures</a>.</p>



<p>In our new survey, 63% of adults say they’ve heard or read a lot or a little about the fact that sports betting is now legal in much of the U.S. That’s up from 56% in 2022. The increase in public awareness comes as betting-related advertisements <a href="https://www.espn.com/espn/betting/story/_/id/44716101/sports-betting-ads-tv-versus-alcohol-study-fantasy-spending-volume">have become common during sports broadcasts</a>.</p>



<p>The rest of this analysis takes a closer look at Americans’ views of and experiences with sports betting. It’s based on the survey of 9,916 U.S. adults, conducted in July and August.</p>

<p>Since 2022, Americans in many demographic groups have become more likely to view the widespread legalization of sports betting as a bad thing for society, as well as for sports.</p>



<p>This is true for men and women; college graduates and non-college graduates; and upper-, middle- and lower-income Americans alike. It is also the case among Democrats and Republicans, as well as among those who have personally placed a sports bet in the past year and those who have not.</p>



<p>Some of the biggest shifts in attitudes about sports betting’s societal impact have come among young Americans – especially young men. <strong>Today, 47% of men under 30 say legal sports betting is a bad thing for society, up from 22% who said this in 2022.</strong> Women under 30 have also become more likely to express this view: 35% see legal sports betting as bad for society, up from 25% three years ago.</p>



<p>The legalization of sports betting has <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/state/sports-betting-tax-revenue/">generated revenue for state governments and gambling operators</a>, but it has also raised concerns about <a href="https://www.ncpgambling.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sports-gambling_NCPGLitRvwExecSummary.pdf">gambling addiction</a> and other societal harms. Critics have also cautioned that it may <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2025/08/bad-bets-the-new-culture-of-sports-gambling/">compromise the integrity of sports</a>. In recent years, several professional and college athletes and team personnel have been punished for violating betting rules.</p>



<details><summary>Recent betting violations in professional sports</summary>
<p>The largest professional sports leagues in North America – including the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Hockey League (NHL) and Major League Soccer (MLS) – ban players, and often coaches and other personnel, from betting on their own sports. In some cases, there are also rules about betting on <em>other</em> sports. Punishments for violating the rules range from fines or suspensions to lifetime bans.</p>



<p>Since the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/us/politics/supreme-court-sports-betting-new-jersey.html">U.S. Supreme Court’s 2018 decision to allow sports betting</a>, at least 20 professional athletes in these five leagues – as well as one NFL coach and one MLB umpire – have faced disciplinary action for violating their leagues’ gambling policies. All but four of these disciplinary actions took place in 2023 and 2024, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of league announcements and media reports.</p>



<p>More than half of the athletes who have faced disciplinary action (11 of 20) were from the NFL. The rest involved players from MLB (five), MLS (two), the NBA (one) and the NHL (one).</p>



<p>In most cases, players received suspensions, ranging from several games to indefinite. However, in 2024, an <a href="https://abc7news.com/post/tucupita-marcano-gets-lifetime-mlb-ban-betting-baseball/14909938/">MLB player</a> and an <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/jontay-porter-banned-from-nba">NBA player</a> each received permanent bans for betting on their own teams’ games.</p>

<p>As was the case in 2022, some groups of Americans are more likely than others to say they’ve personally bet money on sports in the past year in any of the ways we asked about.</p>



<p><strong>Young adults are more likely than older Americans to say they’ve placed a sports bet in the past year.</strong> Some 31% of adults under 30 say this, including 36% of men and 29% of women in this age group. Sports betting is less common in all older age groups.</p>



<p><strong>Black and Hispanic adults are also especially likely to have bet money on sports in the past year:</strong> 30% and 27%, respectively, say they have done so. Roughly two-in-ten Asian (22%) and White (19%) adults say the same.</p>



<p>There are no differences between college graduates and non-college graduates on this question. In each group, 22% say they have bet on sports in the past year. Nor are there major partisan differences: 24% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they have done so, as have 22% of Republicans and Republican leaners.</p>



<h4 id="who-has-placed-an-online-sports-bet-in-the-past-year">Who has placed an online sports bet in the past year?</h4>



<p>When it comes to <em>online </em>sports betting, young adults and Black Americans again stand out.</p>



<p>Overall, 17% of adults under 30 – including 21% of men and 16% of women in this age group – say they’ve placed an online sports wager in the past year. Three years ago, 7% of those under 30 had done so – including 9% of men and 6% of women.</p>



<p>Among Black adults, 19% say they’ve placed an online sports bet in the past year, up from 10% in 2022. Smaller shares of Hispanic (12%), Asian (11%) and White (8%) adults say they’ve done this in the past year.</p>

<h2>2025.10.04: NSA and IETF: <span>Can an attacker simply purchase standardization of weakened cryptography? #pqcrypto #hybrids #nsa #ietf #antitrust</span></h2>
<p>It's normal for post-quantum cryptography
to be rolled out as an <em>extra</em> layer of security on top of traditional pre-quantum cryptography,
rather than as a <em>replacement</em>.</p>
<p>For example,
Google's <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html">CECPQ1</a> experiment
was double encryption with
traditional pre-quantum ECC
(specifically
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#safecurves">X25519</a>)
and post-quantum NewHope1024.
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment/">CECPQ2</a>,
a joint experiment between Google and Cloudflare,
was ECC+NTRUHRSS701.
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment/">CECPQ2b</a>
was ECC+SIKEp434.
<a href="https://ssh-comparison.quendi.de/comparison/kex.html">Ten SSH implementations</a>
support ECC+sntrup761.
Today's usage of post-quantum cryptography by browsers is
<a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#post-quantum-encryption-adoption">approaching half</a>
of the connections seen by Cloudflare,
where
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/vtMTuE_3u-0/m/k6JisLwXAQAJ">95% of that</a>
is ECC+MLKEM768
and 5% is ECC+Kyber768.</p>
<p>If post-quantum cryptography is designed to be super-strong,
so strong that it even survives future quantum computers,
then why are we keeping the ECC layer?
Same reason that you wear your seatbelt:
in the real world, cars sometimes crash, and seatbelts reduce the damage.</p>
<p>Google already explained this back in
<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html">2016</a>:
"The post-quantum algorithm might turn out to be breakable even with today's computers,
in which case the elliptic-curve algorithm will still provide the best security that today's technology can offer."
We've seen
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#qrcsp">many breaks of post-quantum proposals</a>
since then,
including the sudden
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/975">public</a>
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1026">collapse</a>
of SIKE
three years after CECPQ2b applied SIKE to
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment/">tens of millions</a> of user connections.
The <em>only</em> reason that this user data wasn't immediately exposed to attackers
is that CECPQ2b encrypted data with SIKE <em>and</em> with ECC,
rather than switching from ECC to just SIKE.
As another example,
the reference Kyber/ML-KEM software went through two rounds of security patches for
<a href="https://kyberslash.cr.yp.to/">KyberSlash</a> at the end of 2023,
and then had
<a href="https://pqshield.com/pqshield-plugs-timing-leaks-in-kyber-ml-kem-to-improve-pqc-implementation-maturity/">another security patch</a>
in mid-2024.</p>
<p>Deploying ECC+PQ rather than just PQ is an easy common-sense win.
ECC software is practically everywhere anyway,
and nobody has identified an application that can afford PQ without being able to afford ECC+PQ.</p>
<p>Typically people talk about deploying ECC+PQ as deploying "hybrids" rather than "non-hybrids",
although you have to be careful with this terminology
since the word "hybrid" also has other meanings in cryptography.
It's more descriptive to talk about
"double encryption" and "double signatures"
rather than
"single encryption" and "single signatures".</p>
<p><strong><a name="problem">The problem in a nutshell.</a></strong>
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20250930-stealth.html#nsa">Surveillance agency</a>
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-nsa-spying/u-s-court-mass-surveillance-program-exposed-by-snowden-was-illegal-idUSKBN25T3CK/">NSA</a>
and its
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/01/nsa-paid-gchq-spying-edward-snowden">partner</a>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/25/gchqs-mass-data-sharing-violated-right-to-privacy-court-rules">GCHQ</a>
are trying to have standards-development organizations
endorse weakening ECC+PQ down to just PQ.</p>
<p>Part of this is that
NSA and GCHQ have been endlessly repeating arguments that this weakening is a <em>good</em> thing
(in much the same way that NSA advertised
<a href="https://projectbullrun.org/dual-ec/index.html">Dual EC</a>
as providing
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250902084755/https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/events/random-number-generation-workshop-2004/documents/numbertheoreticdrbg.pdf">"increased assurance"</a>).
I have a previous blog post showing that
those arguments <a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20240102-hybrid.html">collapse upon examination</a>.
But that's not today's topic.
In today's blog post I'm instead looking at
how easy it is for NSA to simply spend money to corrupt the standardization process.</p>
<p><strong><a name="tls">Two TLS encryption drafts.</a></strong>
For concreteness,
I'll focus on what's happening in a particular standards-development organization
called the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
Within that,
I'll focus on current proposals within an IETF "working group" (WG)
that sets standards for Transport Layer Security (TLS),
the security layer inside HTTPS and inside various other protocols.
I'll look specifically at how the TLS WG handled
two drafts specifying post-quantum encryption mechanisms for TLS:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hybrid (double encryption):
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250710085814/https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-kwiatkowski-tls-ecdhe-mlkem-03.html">"Post-quantum hybrid ECDHE-MLKEM Key Agreement for TLSv1.3"</a>.
  This draft specifies ECC+PQ in TLS,
  specifically usage in TLS of "X25519MLKEM768, SecP256r1MLKEM768, and SecP384r1MLKEM1024".
  The first of those is also what I mentioned above as
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/vtMTuE_3u-0/m/k6JisLwXAQAJ">95%</a>
  of current post-quantum connections to Cloudflare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-hybrid (single encryption):
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250718131345/https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement-05.html">"ML-KEM Post-Quantum Key Agreement for TLS 1.3"</a>.
  This draft specifies usage in TLS of "ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024" without seatbelts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The non-hybrid draft was first posted in March 2024.
Of course someone asked "what the motivation is for being 'fully post-quantum' rather than hybrid".
The draft author
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/qFRxBSnEPJcdlt7MO0cIL2kW5qc/">responded</a>:
"FIPS / CNSA 2.0 compliance guidelines ...
currently are a big 'maybe' at best for 'hybrid solutions', and the
timetables for compliant browsers, servers, and services are to exclusively
use FIPS 203 at level V (ML-KEM-1024) by 2033. I figure there will be
demand for pure ML-KEM key agreement, not hybrid (with no questions that
come along with it of whether it's actually allowed or not)."</p>
<p>As context,
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States">massive U.S. military budget</a>
now publicly requires cryptographic "components" to have
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221022163808/https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Library/Instructions/CJCSI%206510.02F.pdf?ver=qUEnOsWpGPcGGMFTb4yYVA%3D%3D">NSA approval</a>.
"CNSA 2.0" refers to a public NSA document
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240927153634/https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/07/2003071834/-1/-1/0/CSA_CNSA_2.0_ALGORITHMS_.PDF">"Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0"</a>.
The document says up front that its requirements apply to
"all NSS use of public cryptographic algorithms (as opposed to algorithms NSA developed),
including those on all unclassified and classified NSS".
The <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/us/title-40/subtitle-iii/chapter-111/sec-11103/">legal definition</a>
of "national security system" (NSS)
covers practically all military information systems,
except for "routine administrative and business applications" such as "payroll".</p>
<p>In June 2024,
NSA's William Layton
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/ESCdYNwVeF4VkvoORFJLJk_87VU/">wrote</a>
that "we do not anticipate supporting hybrid in NSS".</p>
<p>In December 2024, a Cisco employee
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/S9Mwv28VEHrG189ZtoubUani7J8/">wrote</a>
the following:
"There are people whose
cryptographic expertise I cannot doubt who say that pure ML-KEM is the
right trade-off for them, and more importantly for my employer, that's
what they're willing to buy.  Hence, Cisco will implement it; I am
essentially just asking for code points."
Certainly "willing to buy" is a statement about funding,
evidently from a source large enough to dictate Cisco actions,
evidently from a source asking for non-hybrids,
evidently from "people whose cryptographic expertise I cannot doubt";
if that source isn't NSA, who is it?</p>
<p>(Side note: If you think the word "pure" in "pure ML-KEM" sounds good,
remember that replacing CECPQ2's ECC+SIKE with "pure SIKE" would have been a disaster.)</p>
<p>In June 2025,
NSA's Mike Jenkins
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/spasm/xUKIoHQwm1BjNZWS2x3xb-BhsLI/">posted</a>
the following:
"As the CNSA 2.0 profiles should make clear, we are looking for products that support /standalone/ ML-DSA-87 and /standalone/ ML-KEM-1024. If there is one vendor
that produces one product that complies, then that is the product that goes on the compliance list and is approved for use. Our interactions with vendors suggests
that this won't be a problem in most cases."
Evidently there are many companies happy to jump when NSA says jump.</p>
<p><strong><a name="dogfood">Pretending to eat your own dog food.</a></strong>
For software engineers,
"dogfooding"
(a term
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120406142929/http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/317315/vmworld_2009_virtualization_controversy_eating_your_own_dog_food/?fp=39&amp;fpid=25874&amp;rid=1">perhaps</a>
coined by Paul Maritz in the 1980s)
refers to making regular use of the software that you're writing.
This builds your confidence that the software works,
and helps iron out problems.</p>
<p>But there's also a marketing version of the same concept,
where you publicly <em>say</em> that you're using your own software
as a way to build <em>other people's</em> confidence in the software.
As in other types of marketing,
what you're saying doesn't have to be true.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, NSA
<a href="https://archive.org/details/cold_war_iii-nsa/cold_war_iii-ISCAP/page/n239/mode/2up">weakened</a>
the Data Encryption Standard to just 56 bits.
In public,
NSA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220805195031/https://cryptome.org/nsa-inman-1979.pdf">claimed</a>
that it hadn't tampered with the standard,
and that the
"implausibility of public allegations is further demonstrated by the fact that
NSA has endorsed the use of DES for the encryption of national security-related information,
including selected classified information".</p>
<p>This is powerful marketing.
Many people hearing this last quote will think
"Oh, okay, NSA is using DES, so DES is strong".
Koblitz and Menezes
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151122060827/https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1018.pdf">claimed</a>
that it's "far-fetched"
that NSA would have intentionally selected something weak
"for U.S. government usage (for both unclassified and classified communications [41])".
Many people today will think
"Oh, okay, NSA is buying single encryption, so double encryption is unimportant".</p>
<p>But DES <a href="https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/27.pdf">wasn't</a> strong.
NSA had engineered DES to be
<a href="https://archive.org/details/cold_war_iii-nsa/cold_war_iii-ISCAP/page/n239/mode/2up">"weak enough"</a>
for NSA to break.
NSA wanted DES to
<a href="https://archive.org/details/cold_war_iii-nsa/cold_war_iii-ISCAP/page/n239/mode/2up">"drive out competitors"</a>,
to "reduce the field that NSA had to be concerned about".</p>
<p>It's perfectly plausible that NSA was using DES,
but surely NSA was then using DES multiple times (Triple-DES or beyond),
which makes it much harder to break
(as long as you <a href="https://sweet32.info/">switch keys frequently</a>).
Obviously NSA wouldn't have said "use multiple layers" publicly:
NSA wanted to fool people into thinking that DES was secure.</p>
<p>Today we have better ciphers than DES.
However, for data that it cares about,
NSA still uses two independent encryption layers
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220524232250/https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/75/documents/resources/everyone/csfc/threat-prevention.pdf">"to mitigate the ability of an adversary to exploit a single cryptographic implementation"</a>.
Gee, maybe multiple encryption is important after all!</p>
<p>Try to put yourself in
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20250930-stealth.html">the mindset of NSA as an attacker</a>.
You have a
<a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2014/04/09/20130905-guard-sigint_enabling.pdf">massive budget</a>
to "covertly influence and/or overtly leverage" systems
to "make the systems in question exploitable";
"to the consumer and other adversaries, however, the systems' security remains intact".
One of your action items is to "influence policies, standards and specification
for commercial public key technologies".
Another is to "shape the worldwide commercial cryptography marketplace
to make it more tractable to advanced cryptanalytic capabilities being developed by NSA/CSS".</p>
<p>You spend this money pursuing many different attack paths,
taking whatever surveillance wins you can get.
It's not that <em>everybody</em> was using Dual EC,
for example,
but you managed to manipulate <em>some</em> people into using it,
and for you that's a win.</p>
<p>Weakening ECC+PQ to just PQ,
normalizing the practice of driving without seatbelts,
is another win for you as the attacker.
It's adding further vulnerabilities to the cryptographic ecosystem.
The point is that,
beyond SIKE and <a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#qrcsp">many other</a> publicly broken cryptosystems,
there will be some further cases where
your "advanced cryptanalytic capabilities" break the PQ part
while the "consumer and other adversaries" think the PQ part is secure.</p>
<p>What do you do with your control over the U.S. military budget?
That's another opportunity to "shape the worldwide commercial cryptography marketplace".
You can tell people that you won't authorize purchasing double encryption.
You can even follow through on having the military publicly purchase single encryption.
Meanwhile you quietly spend a negligible amount of money on an independent encryption layer
to protect the data that you care about,
so you're actually using double encryption.</p>
<p><strong><a name="callgood">Adoption of double encryption in TLS.</a></strong>
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7221">"Adoption"</a>
in IETF is a preliminary step before standardization:
when a WG is
"ready to develop a particular document, the most common mechanism is
for it to 'adopt' an existing document as a starting point".</p>
<p>In March 2025,
after the close of a two-week "WG adoption call",
the TLS WG chairs declared
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250419105450/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/iGLZeIYzsIZPYO1ezA2Eulv5x98/">"consensus to adopt"</a>
the "Post-quantum hybrid ECDHE-MLKEM Key Agreement for TLSv1.3" draft.</p>
<p>There were no objections to the declaration of consensus on adopting this draft.
I had pointed out that the patents on Kyber/ML-KEM create two issues related to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250405080704/https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8179/">IETF's patent policy</a>,
but I said that the first issue can be fixed after adoption (before standardization),
and I now think that this is also true for the second issue.
The risks from patents are orthogonal to the risks from non-hybrids,
and I won't say more about patents in this blog post.</p>
<p><strong><a name="options">Why worry about a weaker standard if there's a stronger standard?</a></strong>
At this point you might be wondering:
if people are driving with seatbelts and this is on its way to being standardized,
what's the problem with <em>also</em> having a driving-without-seatbelts standard
for reckless fools who want to use that?</p>
<p>Think about Dual EC.
Dual EC wasn't the only randomness-generation standard.
But companies paid for FIPS certification of at least
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130224022123/http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/drbg/drbgval.html">62 different implementations</a>
of Dual EC.
NSA
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-rsa-idUSBRE9BJ1C220131220">bribed</a>
the RSA company to change its popular cryptographic library
to use Dual EC by default.</p>
<p>These companies saw that Dual EC was a standard from a reputable standards organization
(in fact, from three such organizations, namely ANSI, ISO, and NIST).
Even for companies realizing that Dual EC was a controversial standard pushed by NSA,
how many companies would risk losing money by refusing to implement Dual EC?
It's <em>easy</em> for purchasing managers to use standards to set purchasing requirements.</p>
<p>What's particularly pernicious about a driving-without-seatbelts standard
is that a purchasing manager who looks at it has an incentive to pick it
instead of the driving-with-seatbelts standard.
Wow, I can save $50 for every seatbelt that I skip!
Wow, I can save <a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#pppqefs">50 picodollars</a> for every ECC operation that I skip!
The purchasing manager doesn't care whether this cost reduction matters in context:
every penny saved sounds good, right?
The purchasing manager also doesn't realize the standard is <em>dangerous</em>:
on the contrary, why would it be a standard if it were unsafe?</p>
<p>Soon we're faced with widespread non-usage of seatbelts.
And then, years too late,
we realize that, oops, something people used and thought was secure actually wasn't,
just as in the case of SIKE.</p>
<p><strong><a name="callbad">Adoption of single encryption in TLS.</a></strong>
On 1 April 2025—unfortunately not as a joke—the TLS WG chairs
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/PpVAwrBTuRb5pR6D0C1ipdQuvYc/">issued</a>
a two-week "WG adoption call for the ML-KEM Post-Quantum Key Agreement for TLS 1.3 I-D",
the non-hybrid draft mentioned above.</p>
<p>Here are some quotes (some from me, some from other people)
illustrating objections raised on the TLS mailing list during the call period:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The draft creates security risks</strong>.
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/2Dfu4x678DEKCzF-fkdvJHJkS-8/">Sample quote</a>:
  "SIKE was applied to large volumes of user data as part of the CECPQ2
  experiment in 2019. SIKE was publicly broken in 2022.
  [paragraph break]
  The <em>only</em> reason that this didn't immediately give away the user data
  to attackers is that CECPQ2 was ECC+SIKE, rather than just SIKE.
  [paragraph break]
  Should we keep rolling out post-quantum cryptosystems to <em>try</em> to stop
  future quantum attacks? Yes, of course. But, just in case this goes
  horribly wrong <em>again</em>, let's make sure to keep ECC in place. Any draft
  violating this should be rejected as a security risk not just by WGs but
  also by the ISE."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The draft violates BCP 188.</strong>
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/xJqwB30b5wf3GVlAiIP3O4tuBIE/">Sample quote</a>:
  "To the extent that this is an allusion to
  NSA purchasing, it violates BCP 188 ('IETF Will Work to Mitigate
  Pervasive Monitoring')."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The draft violates the WG charter.</strong>
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/xJqwB30b5wf3GVlAiIP3O4tuBIE/">Sample quote</a>:
  "the draft's regression from ECC+PQ to just PQ
  is certainly a technology issue; and this is fatal, as a contravention
  of the 'improve security' goal in the WG charter".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>There are no principles supporting the adoption decision.</strong>
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/toxVUv_d1pdDspbfo8OxcJeC_QU/">Sample quote</a>:
  "I don't see what criteria we might use in adopting this that
  wouldn't leave the WG open to accusations of favouritism if
  we don't adopt other pure PQ national standards that will
  certainly arise".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The draft's motivation section is circular.</strong>
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/YNSu6ZO5e0JMJ1cRlnxh6oIjyZg/">Sample quote</a>:
  there is
  "a preliminary step that
  has been skipped here, namely identifying why the proposal is claimed to
  be adding something important. The draft's motivation sentence consists
  of rearranging buzzwords without answering the question:
  'Having a fully post-quantum (not hybrid) key agreement option for TLS
  1.3 is necessary for migrating beyond hybrids and for users that need
  to be fully post-quantum.'&nbsp;"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The draft increases software complexity.</strong>
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/uOmcMEqlyekrvcOgdsf7GtIlf3w/">Sample quote</a>:
  "The main stated benefit of using a standalone ML-KEM is complexity
  reduction, but with the current progress in the deployment of the ML-KEM +
  ECC hybrid method, a standalone ML-KEM method actually increases overall
  complexity in software stacks."
  (This was responding to a claim during the adoption-call period
  that the draft provided a "compute / dependency base that is minimalist".)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a high-level survey of the objections.
These quotes aren't intended to convey the full text of objections.
They also aren't intended to convey the number of people objecting;
I'll get back to that below.</p>
<p><strong><a name="standards">Standardization procedures.</a></strong>
How does a standards-development organization handle objections?
The law on this topic in the United States has been settled for decades.</p>
<p>The starting point is that
agreements in restraint of interstate commerce are
<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2024-title15/html/USCODE-2024-title15-chap1-sec1.htm">illegal</a>.
Courts interpret this to cover various types of agreements
that are illegal <em>per se</em>,
such as price fixing and group boycotts,
along with further agreements that unreasonably interfere with competition.</p>
<p>Here's an
<a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/456/556/">example</a>
from the 1980s.
Agents of a company that was leading its market, McDonnell and Miller,
took control of a subcommittee of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers,
a standards-development organization.
They generated a letter, under ASME's apparent authority,
declaring that a new competitor's product wasn't compliant.
They distributed that letter to buyers, of course damaging the new competitor's business.</p>
<p>The competitor, HydroLevel, sued the conspirators—including ASME,
which didn't even <em>know</em> the abuse was happening.
HydroLevel won. ASME was ultimately forced to pay millions of dollars.
The Supreme Court didn't mince words in describing the anti-competitive
power of standards-development organizations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ASME wields great power in the Nation's economy. Its codes and
standards influence the policies of numerous States and cities, and,
as has been said about "so-called voluntary standards" generally,
its interpretations of its guidelines "may result in economic
prosperity or economic failure, for a number of businesses of all
sizes throughout the country," as well as entire segments of an
industry. ... ASME can be said to be "in reality, an
extragovernmental agency which prescribes rules for the regulation
and restraint of interstate commerce." ... When it cloaks its
subcommittee officials with the authority of its reputation, ASME
permits those agents to affect the destinies of businesses, and thus
gives them the power to frustrate competition in the marketplace.</p>
<p>... Many of ASME's officials are associated with members of the
industries regulated by ASME's codes. Although undoubtedly most
serve ASME without concern for the interests of their corporate
employers, some may well view their positions with ASME, at least in
part, as an opportunity to benefit their employers. When the great
influence of ASME's reputation is placed at their disposal, the less
altruistic of ASME's agents have an opportunity to harm their
employers' competitors through manipulation of ASME's codes.</p>
<p>... Only ASME can take systematic steps to make improper conduct on
the part of all its agents unlikely, and the possibility of civil
liability will inevitably be a powerful incentive for ASME to take
those steps. Thus, a rule that imposes liability on the
standard-setting organization -- which is best situated to prevent
antitrust violations through the abuse of its reputation -- is most
faithful to the congressional intent that the private right of
action deter antitrust violations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another
<a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/486/492/">Supreme Court case</a>
rejected an argument of
antitrust immunity for another standards-development organization.
The organization made various decisions by majority vote,
and had allowed
steel manufacturers to pack a standards-development group,
filling the group with pro-steel agents to take over a vote.
The Supreme Court
again recognized the importance of procedural safeguards preventing abuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The antitrust validity of these efforts is not established, without
more, by petitioner's literal compliance with the rules of the
Association, for the hope of procompetitive benefits depends upon
the existence of safeguards sufficient to prevent the
standard-setting process from being biased by members with economic
interests in restraining competition. An association cannot validate
the anticompetitive activities of its members simply by adopting
rules that fail to provide such safeguards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court declined at that point to draw a dividing line saying
which safeguards were required.
In 2004, Congress passed a
<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2024-title15/html/USCODE-2024-title15-chap69-sec4302.htm">law</a>
pinning this down:
the new law said that "standards development activity" by a "standards development organization"
isn't illegal <em>per se</em>,
and gave
<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2024-title15/html/USCODE-2024-title15-chap69-sec4301.htm">definitions</a>
of the quoted phrases.</p>
<p>In particular, a "standards development organization" is required by law to
"incorporate the attributes of openness, balance of interests, due process, an appeals process, and consensus in a manner consistent
with the Office of Management and Budget Circular Number A-119, as revised February 10, 1998".</p>
<p>That
<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1998-02-19/html/98-4177.htm">OMB rule</a>,
in turn,
defines "consensus" as follows:
"general
agreement, but not necessarily unanimity, and includes a process for
attempting to resolve objections by interested parties, as long as all
comments have been fairly considered, each objector is advised of the
disposition of his or her objection(s) and the reasons why, and the
consensus body members are given an opportunity to change their votes
after reviewing the comments".</p>
<p>The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
inserted itself into a private court case in
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250207015058/https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/file/1178246/dl">2019</a>
to say that "the United States has a significant
interest in the correct interpretation of the exemption from <em>per se</em>
treatment for standards development organizations engaging in standard setting activities".</p>
<p>Deputy Assistant Attorney General Alexander Okuliar in the same division
presented a longer statement to ANSI in
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250617062615/https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/speech/file/1281926/dl">2020</a>
regarding antitrust and standards.
The statement mentioned ANSI's compliance with the same requirements and said
"From an antitrust perspective, these requirements are central".</p>
<p>Here's a random
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250915073928/https://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/2907043f18b6c837c1256f2b00710424/0b9474d4e73bb310c12585fa0058b1ce/$FILE/C00067%20evaluation%20observations-final.pdf">example</a>
of what an objection-response document looks like in ISO, IEC, etc.
Not the best user interface, but it gets the job done.</p>
<p><strong><a name="agreement">There was not general agreement to adopt the non-hybrid draft.</a></strong>
Now that we have the concept of consensus in mind,
let's go back to what happened in the IETF TLS WG
regarding the non-hybrid draft.</p>
<p>During the adoption-call period,
there were statements from 20 people unequivocally supporting adoption:
David Adrian from Google,
Joseph Birr-Pixton,
Uri Blumenthal from Department of Defense subsidiary Lincoln Labs,
"Flo D" from GCHQ,
Quynh Dang from NIST,
Viktor Dukhovni,
Scott Fluhrer from Cisco,
Rebecca Guthrie from NSA,
Russ Housley,
Alicja Kario from IBM subsidiary Red Hat,
Kris Kwiatkowski,
Andrei Popov from Microsoft,
Tirumal Reddy from Cisco,
Yaroslav Rosomakho,
Jan Schaumann,
Sophie Schmieg from Google,
Martin Thomson from Mozilla,
Filippo Valsorda formerly from Google,
Loganaden Velvindron,
and
Thom Wiggers.</p>
<p>There were also statements from 2 people <em>conditionally</em> supporting adoption:
John Mattsson from Ericsson
("I support adoption as long as reuse of ephemeral keys is normatively forbidden, i.e.  MUST NOT reuse")
and
Yaakov Stein
("I support adoption of pure PQC KEMs drafts with Intended status: Informational
(meaning that the IETF is not recommending using)").</p>
<p>However, there were statements from 7 people unequivocally opposing adoption:
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/YyemGJF-4-hRVwOcJ47Rw4Nu8Js/">Thomas Bellebaum</a>
  ("I agree with Stephen on this one and would not support adoption of non-hybrids"),
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/uOmcMEqlyekrvcOgdsf7GtIlf3w/">Andrey Jivsov</a>
  ("I am opposed to the adoption of ML-KEM at this time"),
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/toxVUv_d1pdDspbfo8OxcJeC_QU/">Stephen Farrell</a>
  ("I'm opposed to adoption, at this time"),
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/0f6XBGPElMLNoiS1Eh3u7EhzoGc/">Rich Salz</a>
  ("I was all set to say that I am in favor of adoption, but Stephen's post
  changed my mind. [paragraph break] The conservative and safe thing is to stick to hybrids and that is what the IETF should do for now"),
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/uhWI53zIjWJT5ZiS_UthyBe2k9Y/">Rob Sayre</a>
  ("I oppose adoption"),
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/EzKcwjagajQqcRpH4TDTn70W9hc/">Sun Shuzhou</a>
  ("I'm opposed to adoption"),
and me.</p>
<p>Even assuming that the 2 statements of conditional support are treated as positive votes,
the overall situation here, 22 positive votes and 7 negative votes,
does not qualify as general agreement.
"General"
<a href="https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/general">means</a>
"shared by or affecting most people, or most of the people in a group";
"most"
<a href="https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/most">means</a>
"nearly all of the people or things in a group, or nearly all of something";
the phrase "general agreement" means that nearly everyone agrees.
Merely having three quarters agree is not good enough.</p>
<p>What happens if a standards-development organization issues a rule
declaring that "general agreement" exists
even when a quarter of the votes are in opposition?
I haven't found any court cases on point,
but I would expect courts to reject this
as being inconsistent with the plain meaning of "general agreement".</p>
<p>Anyway, IETF hasn't attempted to issue such a rule.
On the contrary, IETF
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250603130154/https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/">claims</a>
that WG decisions are <em>not</em> taken by voting:
"Decisions within WGs, as with the broader IETF, are taken by 'rough consensus' and not by voting."
This begs the question of what IETF thinks "rough consensus" means.
Letting chairs make arbitrary decisions is a violation of due process.</p>
<p>More to the point, IETF can't override the definition of "consensus" in the law.
That definition requires general agreement.
Adoption of this draft was controversial, and didn't reach general agreement.</p>
<p><strong><a name="resolution">Objections were not handled properly.</a></strong>
Within the statements in favor of adoption,
most of the statements were very short:
e.g., just the words "I support adoption" with no further comments.</p>
<p>Some statements in favor of adoption did say more,
such as stating circular arguments for the draft
(e.g.: "as time progresses, non-hybrid key exchanges will
become more and more commonplace, so why not have it already defined?"),
or expressing concerns about key reuse
(e.g.: "I also share John's concerns about key reuse,
but would prefer to litigate that in the working group, rather than during adoption"),
without responding to the content of the objections.</p>
<p>There was a response to one word in the lack-of-principles objection.
(The response was as follows:
"The NIST competition was international, and Kyber was developed by an
international team. I struggle to understand how adopting this document
would somehow be 'favoritism'.")
A brief note by one supporter tangentially related to one objection
falls far short of fair consideration of each objection by the group as a whole.</p>
<p>I tried to engage that supporter in discussion.
I started by quoting the following earlier statement in the commentator's message:
"I find it to be cognitive dissonance to simultaneously argue that the
quantum threat requires immediate work, and yet we are also somehow
uncertain of if the algorithms are totally broken. Both cannot be true
at the same time."
I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/2Dfu4x678DEKCzF-fkdvJHJkS-8/">responded</a>
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rolling out PQ is trying to reduce the damage from an attacker having a
quantum computer within the security lifetime of the user data. Doing
that as ECC+PQ instead of just PQ is trying to reduce the damage in case
the PQ part is broken. These actions are compatible, so how exactly do
you believe they're contradictory?</p>
<p>Here's an analogous example of basic risk mitigation: there's endless
work that goes into having planes not crash, not hit turbulence, etc.,
but we still ask airplane passengers to keep their seatbelts on whenever
they're in their seats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was still no reply to this
by the time the adoption call closed two weeks later.</p>
<p>The broader pattern was that
objectors were engaging in discussion while supporters were not.
The majority process wasn't "attempting to resolve each objection";
it was simply collecting positive votes,
trying to <em>override</em> objections from the minority
without even <em>answering</em> those objections,
let alone trying to <em>resolve</em> them.</p>
<p>That's in an organization saying that decisions aren't taken by voting.
The same organization also
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250528213926/https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-llc-statement-competition-law-issues/">says</a>,
as part of explaining why it's supposedly complying with antitrust law:
"IETF activities are conducted with extreme transparency, in public forums. Decision-making requires achieving broad consensus via these public processes."</p>
<p>When there's an objection,
the legal concept of consensus
requires not just fairly considering the objection,
and not just attempting to resolve the objection,
but—if resolution fails—having the group agree on
the contents of a <em>response</em> to the objection.
That's an official statement of <em>why</em> the objection was overridden.
It's something that can be appealed if it's wrong.
Consider, for example,
ISO's
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250626064256/https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/consolidated/index.html#a_2_5_3">simple rule</a>
saying "Committees are required to respond to all comments received".
In IETF, there weren't even <em>informal</em> responses to the objections listed above,
let alone official responses.</p>
<p><strong><a name="chairs">The chairs declared consensus anyway.</a></strong>
Shortly before the end of the specified adoption-call period,
the chairs
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/_AWy51BSgX1ipv0hfnAzLrDrTYI/">declared</a>
"consensus to adopt this draft as a working group item".
There were some notes on followup procedures,
but there was no explanation of the rationale for this claim of consensus.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250424144801/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/iCPW1FHzdwoYuUztIVfZvDtJYII/">challenged</a>
the claim of consensus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Um, what? There were several people (including me) raising objections on
list to basic flaws in this draft, such as (1) the failure to provide an
ECC backup to limit the damage from further security problems in the PQ
layer, (2) the failure to provide an engineering justification for this
option, and (3) the lack of any principles that would justify saying no
to options selected by other governments if this option is allowed.</p>
<p>Your message doesn't explain how you came to the conclusion that there's
consensus. Surely you aren't relying on some tally of positive votes to
ram this document through while ignoring objections; voting isn't how
IETF is supposed to work. So how <em>did</em> you come to this conclusion?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few days later,
the chairs
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250522155251/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/k7_PEqKZulXMtm-D_9pEvfqcxAU/">responded</a>
that they had declared consensus
"because there is clearly sufficient interest to work on this draft".</p>
<p>I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250513013809/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/501mDxIkopb4xubDc8YQYyiZQDU/">said</a>
that this was ambiguous (sufficient for what?);
said that in any case this criterion was improper since it "would allow a draft to be adopted
over amply justified objections of almost all WG participants,
simply because the chairs and a few participants say they have enough interest in working on the draft";
and asked for an explicit statement
of whether this was the complete explanation
of why the chairs had declared consensus.</p>
<p>The chairs
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250617140508/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/25uD_umU7uOL9LQ1sirFxyA9xmA/">responded</a>
that "sufficient" means "that there were enough people willing to review the draft".
They added that "WGs groups have adopted drafts with much less support than this one received."
Gee, that's confidence-inspiring.</p>
<p>Meanwhile
an IETF "security area director"
had jumped into the discussion,
in particular
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250517194102/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/RK1HQB7Y-WFBxQaAveeT7pHZbbc/">writing</a>
"There is clearly consensus
based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ...
The vast majority was in favour of adoption ...
There were a few dissenting opinions".</p>
<p>Remember that the actual tallies were 20 supporters, 2 conditional supporters, and 7 opponents,
even if some people (for example, me) had sent multiple messages.
Nobody had posted the actual tallies at this point:
there was just this "security area director" claiming that the "vast majority" of the "67 responses" were in favor
while there were only "a few dissenting opinions".
Also remember that this is an organization that claims
that it doesn't make decisions by voting.</p>
<p>The "security area director"
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250517194102/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/RK1HQB7Y-WFBxQaAveeT7pHZbbc/">continued</a>
that "you cherry-picking when to call
consensus evaluation 'voting' depending on whether misnaming this
is in your advantage ... is dishonestly manipulative";
that I was violating the "code of conduct";
and that if I did not "voluntarily stop this kind of behaviour"
there would be "measures under the terms of RFC3934 which is part of BCP25".</p>
<p>In a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250513185456/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/nqouPVfPtU7hm-RF0lSDHCfze54/">followup message</a>,
the "security area director" wrote
"you calling into question this consensus
call of the WG chair is abusive and follows a repetitive pattern.
Nevertheless, for now this is your right ...
you are attempting to bait the chairs to
say they took inventory of the public emails ...
there comes a point where you will be prevented from further playing these games".</p>
<p>Wait a minute: "<em>for now</em> this is your right" (emphasis added)
and "you will be prevented from further playing these games"?
Sounds ominous.
What did the "security area director" mean by this?
No more objections in IETF?
No more appeals?
NSA's minions can just ram their non-consensual drafts through IETF
without opponents even being allowed to <em>speak up</em>?</p>
<p>Actually, yes, there's a stealth activity going on right now
that will have this effect unless enough people take action by Tuesday the 7th.
I hope to have another blog post up in a day or two saying what's going on here.</p>
<p>Anyway,
I've filed a formal
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20250812-non-hybrid.pdf">complaint</a>
regarding the claim of consensus to adopt.
So far the complaint hasn't been handled properly,
but hope springs eternal.
I don't have an answer yet to the subtitle question of this blog post.</p><hr><span size="1"><b>Version:</b>

<p>What’s the catch? Seems to good to be true? Well, this thing sits between your devices and the wall. So you need to neatly run extension cables from every room in the house to the “sun box”, and then run one cable from the box to the panels, and another to the wall (optional, just so it can fall back to pulling power from the wall). Photos of this are coming soon.</p>

<p>Will it ever push power back into the wall? Nope! It’ll only ever draw from the wall in the event that both the sun is down and the battery is dead (so your fridge won’t go off overnight for example).</p>

<p>Is this legal? Yes, see above. No difference to plugging your fridge into your wall, as far as the utility is concerned.</p>

The only change </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/uks-demands-apple-break-encryption-emergency-us-all"><span>since the last time</span></a><span> they demanded this is that the order is allegedly limited to only apply to British users. That doesn’t make it any better.</span></p>
<p><span>The demand uses a power called a “Technical Capability Notice” (TCN) in the U.K.’s Investigatory Powers Act. </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/investigatory-powers-bill-and-apple"><span>At the time of its signing</span></a><span> we noted this law would likely be used to demand Apple spy on its users. <br></span></p>
<p><span>After the U.K. government first issued the TCN in January, </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/cornered-uks-demand-encryption-backdoor-apple-turns-its-strongest-security-setting"><span>Apple was forced</span></a><span> to either create a backdoor or block its </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-encrypt-your-iphone"><span>Advanced Data Protection</span></a><span> feature—which turns on end-to-end encryption for iCloud—for all U.K. users. The company decided to remove the feature in the U.K. instead of creating the backdoor.</span></p>
<p><span>The initial order from January targeted the data of </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> Apple users. In August, the </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-spy-chief-gabbard-says-uk-agreed-drop-backdoor-mandate-apple-2025-08-19/"><span>US claimed the U.K. withdrew the demand</span></a><span>, but Apple did not re-enable Advanced Data Protection. The new order provides insight into why: the U.K. was just rewriting it to only apply to British users. <br></span></p>
<p><span>This is still an unsettling overreach that makes U.K. users less safe and less free. As we’ve said</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/clipper-chips-birthday-looking-back-22-years-key-escrow-failures"> <span>time</span></a><span> and</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption"> <span>time again</span></a><span>,</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/10/salt-typhoon-hack-shows-theres-no-security-backdoor-thats-only-good-guys"> <span>any backdoor built for the government</span></a><span> puts everyone at greater risk of hacking, identity theft, and fraud. It sets a dangerous precedent to demand similar data from other companies, and provides a runway for other authoritarian governments to issue comparable orders. The news of continued server-side access to users' data comes just days after the UK government announced an </span><a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/press-releases/id-cards-uk-risks-sleeping-walking-into-pre-crime-state/"><span>intrusive mandatory digital ID scheme</span></a><span>, framed as a measure against illegal migration.</span></p>
<p><span>A tribunal hearing was initially set to </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c740r0m4mzjo"><span>take place in January 2026</span></a><span>, though it’s currently unclear if that will proceed or if the new order changes the legal process. Apple must continue to refuse these types of backdoors. Breaking end-to-end encryption for one country breaks it for everyone. These repeated attempts to weaken encryption violates</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/european-court-human-rights-confirms-undermining-encryption-violates-fundamental"> <span>fundamental human rights</span></a><span> and destroys our right to private spaces.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content-blocks"><p><span>The numbers are in: </span><span><strong>no one is paying for Microsoft 365 Copilot</strong></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>No, not the official numbers designed by Microsoft to </span><span><a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/numbers-designed-to-please" target="_blank" rel="">support their narrative</a></span><span>. I’m talking about something that MS would prefer not to address as these numbers tell a whole different story. As a result, they are from a source that we cannot verify and therefore something that every reader needs to evaluate the trustworthiness of.</span></p><div translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><p>❝</p><p><span><em>“A source that has seen materials related to sales has confirmed that, as of August 2025, Microsoft has around </em></span><span><em><strong>eight million active licensed users of Microsoft 365 Copilot</strong></em></span><span><em>, amounting to a 1.81% conversion rate across the 440 million Microsoft 365 subscribers.”</em></span></p></div><p><span>I know, Ed Zitron is hardly a neutral observer of the tech industry. He is doing something that almost no one else out there bothers to do, though. Which is checking whether the numbers released by tech vendors (especially OpenAI) make any sense. This is the foundation upon which his case against the financial validity of GenAI is built on, and being a regular reader of his premium newsletter issues, I find it fairly convincing.</span></p><p><span>So, when someone on the inside wants to find a channel to bring out the inconvenient truth about AI adoption, Ed is where they would likely reach out to. These numbers that have been disclosed about Microsoft’s commercial success (failure) of selling Copilot licenses are in line with those reported about the adoption rate of other paid AI plans from other vendors.</span></p><p><span>The story can be summarized as follows:</span></p><p><span>M365 Copilot became available for enterprise customers to purchase on November 1st, 2023. That was almost 2 years ago. Now, if we assume that the adoption rate is constant, the conversion rate mentioned by Ed could grow to around 2% by the time we reach November 2025.</span></p><p><span><strong>The 2% adoption rate in 2 years is diabolically bad.</strong></span><span> This is not just any lil’ Power Apps product that was promoted as a new tool for citizen developers to improve personal productivity. It has been the centerpiece of everything Microsoft has done and talked about for over 2 years now. I have never seen a bigger push for any MS product.</span></p><p><span>After all this — what do we even have here? 8 million active licensed users. For some tech products that might be a sizeable user base. But let’s be real here: Microsoft has at least 400,000 channel partners. If each partner org would have bought on average 20 seats of Microsoft 365 Copilot for their employees, that would already make up the 8M figure.</span></p><p><span>Indeed, most partners have to pay for the M365 Copilot seats. There are hardly any freebies available in the partner benefits packages. I pay €800 a year for MS licenses in </span><span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/membership/partner-success-core-benefits" target="_blank" rel="">Partner Success Core</a></span><span> and that doesn’t give me a single M365 Copilot seat. I have to pay the full price of €337 per year to get a chance to use the premium Copilot experience in my tenant for my solopreneur </span><span><a href="https://niiranenadvisory.com/" target="_blank" rel="">Power Platform advisory business</a></span><span>.</span></p><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://niiranenadvisory.com/"><img src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,quality=80,format=auto,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/1048e07d-ae52-43b3-b9f0-f0a89a45f137/Need_more_than_Perspectives.png" alt=""></a></p></div><p><span>This, of course, makes it easier to evaluate whether I get value from the license or not. While I acknowledge that I’m not the typical user persona for M365 Copilot, it has given me just a fraction of the value that my ChatGPT Plus subscription does. At a lower price point. Since I don’t have to sell and promote this product to customers, like many MS partners do, I’m free to tell everyone about this experience. As I’ve done in this newsletter for the past year on many, many occasions.</span></p><p><span>It could have been just me who’s a cranky old CRM consultant shouting at the AI cloud. Well, based on these adoption numbers for Microsoft 365 Copilot, I’m not in the minority. </span><span><strong>The vast majority of people out there who use Microsoft cloud tools don’t see Copilot as giving them enough value to justify the $30 per month cost.</strong></span></p><p><span>Remember: even though these aren’t individual users buying things for themselves, we’re not talking about just another MS license. This is AI! It’s the thing that’s </span><span><em>“no longer optional”</em></span><span> at so many companies — thanks to all the AI CEOs forcing their employees to adopt it or else. We read about these initiatives from media of how business leaders want to transform their company via AI on a daily basis.</span></p><p><span>There must be loads of companies who have gone and ticked the AI box by choosing to purchase M365 Copilot licenses. And despite all this blind support from management, this is as far as Microsoft has gotten with the paid Copilot product sales.</span></p><p id="agents-arent-doing-any-better"><h2 translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><span>Agents aren’t doing any better</span></h2></p><p><span>Another interesting figure from Ed’s newsletter was about SharePoint agents:</span></p><div translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><p>❝</p><p><span><span><em>“I’m also hearing that less than SharePoint — another popular enterprise app from Microsoft with 250 million users — had less than 300,000 weekly active users of its AI copilot features in August.”</em></span></span></p></div><p><span>Hmm, let’s see now. What other numbers do we have of agents that we could compare this with? Oh, right! The 3 million agents in FY25 story. Let’s revisit a screenshot I shared in my </span><span><a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/numbers-designed-to-please" target="_blank" rel="">Numbers designed to please</a></span><span> article a couple of months ago:</span></p><div><p><img src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,quality=80,format=auto,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/d3ff173e-686b-4c23-bd8b-d57c9561ef38/3_million_agents_Jeff_Teper.png" alt=""></p></div><p><span>My theory (as well as Suhail’s) was that most of the 3M agents would be in SharePoint, and they wouldn’t be in production use. Weekly usage could well be considered a threshold for an AI agent being in production, so that would give us 10% when comparing it to the 300k figure in Ed’s newsletter.</span></p><p><span>But that was about </span><span><strong>users</strong></span><span>. Unlike Copilot, which is supposed to be a personal AI assistant, agents are meant to be tools that many individuals tap into with their Copilot. Now, let’s ignore for a moment the crazy fact that you can’t use SharePoint agents in the Microsoft 365 Copilot UI. Out of the 300 million users of SharePoint Online (I don’t know why Ed said only 250M), 0.1% of them interacted with an agent during a week in August 2025. </span><span><strong>One user out of a thousand</strong></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Can you feel the AI transformation already?</span></p><p id="where-does-microsoft-go-from-here"><h2 translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><span>Where does Microsoft go from here?</span></h2></p><p><span>If this were a normal software product, the industry would have moved on already and invented something else to pitch to customers. In practice, it is anything but normal. GenAI is the only story left for Big Tech to tell when chasing for ever greater growth percentages. And yet the only thing growing are the capex investments.</span></p><p><span>Getting people to use AI services that they either want to (ChatGPT, all the AI coding assistants) or can’t avoid (Google search AI overviews, free Copilot features in MS products) is one thing. Making them voluntarily open their wallets and insert a credit card to purchase some of the AI magic dust is a whole different game. That’s the game where everyone has been losing so far, as no one besides NVidia or the IT consulting companies is making profits from GenAI at this point.</span></p><p><span>It’s not like all those GPUs could be left underutilized, though. The growth of especially the US economy relies on AI related activities. If they were to be removed, the </span><span><a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/what-bubble-oh-that-bubble" target="_blank" rel="">bubble would burst</a></span><span>. So, rolling back AI features is not an option, understandably. The only possibility is to reimagine the monetization model and hope that it works this time. And that’s exactly what Microsoft is actively pursuing.</span></p><p><span>First of all, the idea of bundling more of Copilot into the licenses customers already have is the obvious way to boost AI adoption.

What has been disguised as a marketing campaign to ride on the popularity of the vibe coding concept is actually an indirect admittance of the fact that GPT based M365 Copilot has been a disappointment for everyone. That’s why Microsoft is now teaming up with OpenAI’s biggest competitor Anthropic and building its new Office Agent features on top of Claude:</span></p><div translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><p>❝</p><p><span><em>“Today we’re introducing Office Agent, a multi-agent system that builds upon an open-source stack, </em></span><span><em><strong>Anthropic's Claude model</strong></em></span><span><em>, and a new taste-driven development (TDD) paradigm to deliver polished PowerPoint presentations, ready-to-use Word documents, and soon Excel spreadsheets.”</em></span></p></div><p><span>All of that is preview stuff, of course.

Well, tech industry reporters have been talking about how Charles Lamanna &amp; crew are embracing Claude for a while now, so I see it as only a matter of time before models like the new </span><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/copilot-studio/available-today-claude-sonnet-4-5-in-microsoft-copilot-studio/" target="_blank" rel="">Claude Sonnet 4.5</a></span><span> are running on Azure in addition to AWS. Because otherwise the Office Agent won’t be as good with spreadsheets and docs like competing products that tap into the best LLM for the job.</span></p><p><span>How good is Office Agent then?

Then, I gave it a task: </span><span><em>“build me a 5-year investor-ready financial model for a SaaS startup.”</em></span><span> Like a user of our </span><span><a href="https://www.finmodeler.com/" target="_blank" rel="">FinModeler SaaS app</a></span><span> might do.</span></p><p><span>What was the result? 12 minutes of work, timing out after endless verifications and “finalizing” steps.

Given how quickly things change in the MS AI roulette table, it might of course not arrive in the format that Charles Lamanna was telling in the internal memo in August. But one thing that I’m increasingly confident of is that </span><span><strong>we will see a per-agent monetization model emerge</strong></span><span>. Simply because the per user M365 Copilot commercial model has failed so dramatically.</span></p><p><span>The latest announcement of </span><span><strong><em>“Bring Your Own Copilot”</em></strong></span><span> model with the new personal and family </span><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/10/01/meet-microsoft-365-premium-your-ai-and-productivity-powerhouse/" target="_blank" rel="">Microsoft 365 Premium SKU</a></span><span> is </span><span><u><strong>not</strong></u></span><span> a sign of the premium value of Copilot. On the contrary, the basic AI features in Office apps are now such a commodity that MS is simply creating a new model to allow individual employees to sneak in a paid Copilot license via their personal MS account into work context inside M365 tenants. Since only 2% of the workers had premium Copilot licenses anyway, getting a bigger audience opening the AI tools through any means necessary is now on the table.</span></p><p><span>And so we get the “BYOAI” model, something that will irritate every single enterprise IT admin, of course. But the thing is: a personal M365 Premium won’t unlock any of the premium features like MS Graph grounding for Copilot. Which should lead everyone to asking: “what exactly is premium anymore”? The answers from </span><span><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/employees-can-bring-copilot-from-their-personal-microsoft-365-plans-to-work---wh/4458212" target="_blank" rel="">this blog post</a></span><span> aren’t very detailed nor convincing:</span></p><div translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><p>❝</p><p><span><strong><em>Q: What features are available with personal Copilot subscriptions?</em></strong></span><br><span><em>A: Features like Researcher, Analyst, Photos Agent, and Actions may be available depending on the subscription tier.

There isn’t any concrete context given on what specifically is not working in the current mode of operation at Microsoft, just the general notion that everyone at the company needs to do better in these unprecedented times. Aside from the key thing about Nadella making way to Althoff, it’s pretty shallow. Here’s how the internal memo ends:</span></p><div translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><p>❝</p><p><span><em>This will also allow our engineering leaders and me to be laser focused on our highest ambition technical work—across our datacenter buildout, systems architecture, AI science, and product innovation—to lead with intensity and pace in this generational platform shift.

Hardly a surprise, given how much the business success of people selling and consulting M365 Copilot depends on the product being seen as something desirable.</span></p><p><span>I’m not saying all is lost for MS. My main point is that whatever they tried to pull off with the $30pupm M365 Copilot license backfired dramatically.

But we, the people working with Microsoft tech every day, deserve to know what happened and remember it the next time a similar stunt is played.</span></p><p><span>To illustrate my point, and give it a perspective that’s not just “my opinion with no facts whatsoever” (as some people on the professional network said), I asked Claude Sonnet 4.5 to crunch the same numbers.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/privacy-harm-harm">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/privacy-harm-harm</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45474441">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p>Every day, corporations track our movements through license plate scanners, building detailed profiles of where we go, when we go there, and who we visit. When they do this to us in violation of data privacy laws, we’ve suffered a real harm—period. We shouldn’t need to prove we’ve suffered additional damage, such as physical injury or monetary loss, to have our day in court.</p>
<p>That's why EFF is proud to join an <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/2025-09-25-mata-v-dnr-amicus-br-aclu-eff-etc">amicus brief</a> in <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/102042-texas-company-violated-privacy-millions-california-drivers-claims.html"><em>Mata v. Digital Recognition Network</em></a>, a lawsuit by drivers against a corporation that allegedly violated a California <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&amp;division=3.&amp;title=1.81.23.&amp;part=4.&amp;chapter=&amp;article=">statute</a> that regulates Automatic License Plate Readers (<a href="https://sls.eff.org/technologies/automated-license-plate-readers-alprs">ALPRs</a>). The state trial court erroneously dismissed the case, by misinterpreting this data privacy law to require proof of extra harm beyond privacy harm. The brief was written by the <a href="https://www.aclunc.org/home">ACLU of Northern California</a>, Stanford’s <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/juelsgaard-intellectual-property-and-innovation-clinic/">Juelsgaard Clinic</a>, and UC Law SF’s <a href="https://www.uclawsf.edu/center-for-constitutional-democracy/">Center for Constitutional Democracy</a>.</p>
<p>The amicus brief explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>This case implicates critical questions about whether a California privacy law, enacted to protect people from harmful surveillance, is not just words on paper, but can be an effective tool for people to protect their rights and safety.</p>
<p>California’s Constitution and laws empower people to challenge harmful surveillance at its inception without waiting for its repercussions to manifest through additional harms. A foundation for these protections is article I, section 1, which grants Californians an inalienable right to privacy.</p>
<p>People in the state have long used this constitutional right to challenge the privacy-invading collection of information by private and governmental parties, not only harms that are financial, mental, or physical. Indeed, widely understood notions of privacy harm, as well as references to harm in the California Code, also demonstrate that term’s expansive meaning.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>What’s At Stake</h4>
<p>The defendant, Digital Recognition Network, also known as <a href="https://drndata.com/">DRN Data</a>, is a subsidiary of Motorola Solutions that provides access to a massive searchable database of ALPR data collected by private contractors. Its customers include law enforcement agencies and private companies, such as insurers, lenders, and repossession firms. DRN is the sister company to the infamous surveillance vendor <a href="https://drndata.com/blog/vigilant-solutions-bolsters-commercial-lpr-database-agreement-plate-locate/">Vigilant Solutions</a> (now Motorola Solutions), and together they have <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/ICE-to-see-car-locations-through-Bay-Area-12529140.php">provided data to ICE</a> through a contract with <a href="https://www.aclunc.org/docs/DOCS_031319.pdf">Thomson Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>The consequences of weak privacy protections are already playing out across the country. This year alone, authorities in multiple states have used license plate readers to hunt for <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/05/she-got-abortion-so-texas-cop-used-83000-cameras-track-her-down">people seeking reproductive healthcare</a>. Police officers have used these systems to <a href="https://local12.com/news/nation-world/police-chief-gets-caught-using-license-plate-cameras-to-track-his-ex-girlfriend-228-times-arrests-charges-probation-flock-safety-follow-stalk-new-boyfriend-broke-up-out-of-town-misuse">stalk romantic partners</a> and <a href="https://www.404media.co/california-cops-investigate-immigration-protest-with-ai-camera-system/">monitor political activists</a>. ICE has tapped into these networks to <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/">track down immigrants</a> and their families for deportation.</p>
<h4>Strong Privacy Laws</h4>
<p>This case could determine whether privacy laws have real teeth or are just words on paper. If corporations can collect your personal information with impunity—knowing that unless you can prove bodily injury or economic loss, you can’t fight back—then privacy laws lose value.</p>
<p>We need <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/privacy-first-better-way-address-online-harms">strong data privacy laws</a>. We need a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/01/you-should-have-right-sue-companies-violate-your-privacy">private right of action</a> so when a company violates our data privacy rights, we can sue them. We need a broad definition of “harm,” so we can sue over our lost privacy rights, without having to prove collateral injury. EFF wages this battle when <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/07/americans-deserve-more-current-american-data-privacy-protection-act">writing privacy laws</a>, when <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/01/victory-illinois-supreme-court-protects-biometric-privacy">interpreting those laws</a>, and when asserting “standing” in <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/04/our-privacy-act-lawsuit-against-doge-and-opm-why-judge-let-it-move-forward">federal</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/12/california-courts-must-protect-data-privacy">state</a> courts.</p>
<p>The fight for privacy isn’t just about legal technicalities. It’s about preserving your right to move through the world without being constantly tracked, catalogued, and profiled by corporations looking to profit from your personal information.</p>

<li>Technical decisions are often made for <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45441068">completely selfish reasons</a> that cannot be influenced by a well-meaning engineer</li>
<li>Powerful stakeholders are typically <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45442587">so stupid and dysfunctional</a> that it’s effectively impossible for you to identify their needs and deliver solutions to them</li>
<li>The political game being played depends on private information that software engineers do not have, so any attempt to get involved will result in just blundering around</li>
<li>Managers and executives spend most of their time playing politics, while engineers spend most of their time doing engineering, so engineers are at a serious political disadvantage before they even start</li>
</ul>
<p>The general idea here is that <strong>software engineers are simply not equipped to play the game at the same level as real political operators</strong>. This is true! It would be a terrible mistake for a software engineer to think that you ought to start scheming and plotting like you’re in <em>Game of Thrones</em>. Your schemes will be immediately uncovered and repurposed to your disadvantage and other people’s gain. Scheming takes practice and power, and neither of those things are available to software engineers.</p>
<p>It is simply a fact that software engineers are tools in the political game being played at large companies, not players in their own right. However, there are many ways to get involved in politics without scheming.</p>
<p>The easiest way is to <strong>actively work to make a high-profile project successful</strong>. This is more or less what you ought to be doing anyway, just as part of your ordinary job. If your company is heavily investing in some new project - these days, likely an AI project - using your engineering skill to make it successful<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> is a politically advantageous move for whatever VP or executive is spearheading that project. In return, you’ll get the rewards that executives can give at tech companies: bonuses, help with promotions, and positions on future high-profile projects. I wrote about this almost a year ago in <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/ratchet-effects"><em>Ratchet effects determine engineer reputation at large companies</em></a>.</p>
<p>A slightly harder way (but one that gives you more control) is to <strong>make your pet idea available for an existing political campaign</strong>. Suppose you’ve wanted for a while to pull out some existing functionality into its own service. There are two ways to make that happen.</p>
<p>The hard way is to expend your own political capital: drum up support, let your manager know how important it is to you, and slowly wear doubters down until you can get the project formally approved. The easy way is to <strong>allow some executive to spend their (much greater) political capital on your project</strong>. You wait until there’s a company-wide mandate for some goal that aligns with your project (say, a push for reliability, which often happens in the wake of a high-profile incident). Then you suggest to your manager that your project might be a good fit for this. If you’ve gauged it correctly, your org will get behind your project. Not only that, but it’ll increase your political capital instead of you having to spend it.</p>
<p>Organizational interest comes in waves. When it’s reliability time, VPs are desperate to be <em>doing something</em>. They want to come up with plausible-sounding reliability projects that they can fund, because they need to go to their bosses and point at what they’re doing for reliability, but they don’t have the skillset to do it on their own. They’re typically happy to fund anything that the engineering team suggests. On the other hand, when the organization’s attention is focused somewhere else - say, on a big new product ship - the last thing they want is for engineers to spend their time on an internal reliability-focused refactor that’s invisible to customers.</p>
<p>So if you want to get something technical done in a tech company, <strong>you ought to wait for the appropriate wave</strong>. It’s a good idea to prepare multiple technical programs of work, all along different lines. Strong engineers will do some of this kind of thing as an automatic process, simply by noticing things in the normal line of work. For instance, you might have rough plans:</p>
<ul>
<li>to migrate the billing code to stored-data-updated-by-webhooks instead of cached API calls</li>
<li>to rip out the ancient hand-rolled build pipeline and replace it with Vite</li>
<li>to rewrite a crufty high-volume Python service in Golang</li>
<li>to replace the slow CMS frontend that backs your public documentation with a fast static site</li>
</ul>
<p>When executives are concerned about billing, you can offer the billing refactor as a reliability improvement. When they’re concerned about developer experience, you can suggest replacing the build pipeline. When customers are complaining about performance, you can point to the Golang rewrite as a good option. When the CEO checks the state of the public documentation and is embarrassed, you can make the case for rebuilding it as a static site. <strong>The important thing is to have a detailed, effective program of work ready to go for whatever the flavor of the month is.</strong></p>
<p>Some program of work will be funded whether you do this or not. However, if you don’t do this, you have no control over what that program is. In my experience, <strong>this is where companies make their worst technical decisions</strong>: when the political need to do <em>something</em> collides with a lack of any good ideas. When there are no good ideas, a bad idea will do, in a pinch. But nobody prefers this outcome. It’s bad for the executives, who then have to sell a disappointing technical outcome as if it were a success<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>, and it’s bad for the engineers, who have to spend their time and effort building the wrong idea.</p>
<p>If you’re a very senior engineer, the VPs (or whoever) will quietly blame you for this. They’ll be right to! <strong>Having the right idea handy at the right time is your responsibility.</strong></p>
<p>You can view all this in two different ways. Cynically, you can read this as a suggestion to make yourself a convenient tool for the sociopaths who run your company to use in their endless internecine power struggles. Optimistically, you can read this as a suggestion to let executives set the overall priorities for the company - that’s their job, after all - and to tailor your own technical plans to fit<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>. Either way, you’ll achieve more of your technical goals if you push the right plan at the right time.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Self-hosting an email server is useful for automating tasks like mailing lists, newsletters, or email verification APIs.
</p>

<p>
The elephant in the room is real-world deliverability. <b>With self-hosting you risk not receiving mail or someone missing your mail.</b> I accept this for my personal projects, but you may not. Keep this in mind.
</p>

<p>
For me the selling point of self-hosting is that it’s practically free. If you’re already self-hosting a website, installing some extra packages on your server and just a bit of your time is all that’s required. Mail takes very little storage and the software is light, so you’re unlikely to significantly change energy consumption or disk usage.
</p>

<p>
For the longest time, I perceived self-hosting email as too difficult, but after doing it for one of my projects, I can say it’s not much harder or more time-consuming than configuring some email SaaS.
</p>

<p>
I changed my goals a bit to make the setup easier though. Self-hosting a multi-user webmail looks heavy and is more involved than I was willing to get into, so I just skipped it. That way, I didn’t have to bother with user accounts, databases, or the web at all, and the task became easy.
</p>

<p>
With my config, manually sending and receiving email is possible if you SSH to your mail server and use the minimal sendmail or mailx commands, or Mutt if you like TUI. The setup is enough for me now, but I could expand it in the future, and multi-user webmail isn’t off the table anyway. Maybe I’ll even write a simple webmail package myself!
</p>


<h2>Setting up Postfix</h2>

<p>
You just need to open port 25, and install and configure <a href="https://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a> and <a href="http://www.opendkim.org/">OpenDKIM</a> on your machine. Postfix is a complete SMTP server, and is enough for basic mail alone, but in practice you also need OpenDKIM to get your mail delivered to popular services like Gmail.
</p>

<p>
Here's my Postfix config to show how easy it is. I left the master.cf file as it was, because I’m always submitting email locally. Notice there's no mention of POP3 or IMAP. I didn't set them up, because I didn't need them.
</p>

<p>
The default alias and header check config files are practically self-explanatory (just open them and read the comments!).
</p>

<details>
<summary>/etc/postfix/main.cf</summary>
<pre>compatibility_level = 3.8
mail_owner = postfix

myhostname = mx.idx.cy
myorigin = idx.cy
mydestination = localhost, idx.cy, maxadamski.com, localchat.cc
inet_interfaces = all
inet_protocols = ipv4

# Addresses
alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/aliases
alias_database = $alias_maps
recipient_delimiter = +

# I'm the only user on my machine, so I send from whichever address I want.
#smtpd_sender_login_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sender_login_maps
#smtpd_sender_restrictions = reject_authenticated_sender_login_mismatch

# spam
#in_flow_delay = 1s
header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/header_checks
setgid_group = postdrop

# TLS (strict)
smtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/ssl/tls/mx.idx.cy.crt
smtpd_tls_key_file = /etc/ssl/tls/mx.idx.cy.key
smtpd_tls_security_level = encrypt
smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3, !TLSv1, !TLSv1.1
smtpd_tls_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3, !TLSv1, !TLSv1.1
smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt
smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3, !TLSv1, !TLSv1.1
smtp_tls_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3, !TLSv1, !TLSv1.1

# DKIM
smtpd_milters = inet:localhost:8891
non_smtpd_milters = inet:localhost:8891
milter_default_action = accept
</pre>
</details>

<h2>TLS</h2>

<p>
You will also need an SSL certificate for encryption in transit. I hate getting and renewing SSL certificates, because the tools are bulky and automation is yet another moving part in your system (I used the lego package, with the manual DNS challenge for simplicity, but I’m not too happy about it). I won’t give you a tutorial on getting SSL certificates, but note that you don’t have to get and renew a certificate for each of your custom domains!
</p>

<p>
You just need one SSL certificate for your machine to encrypt data in transit to other SMTP servers. If you create an A record mx.example.com pointing to your email machine’s IP address, then grab a free certificate for mx.example.com from Let’s Encrypt. Then point to it in the Postfix configuration, and you’ve got transport encryption! In short, only the MX hostname needs a cert for STARTTLS to be used for encryption.
</p>

<p>
Why no certificates for your actual email domains like example.com? Because the email domain has little to do with transport encryption. TLS only secures the connection between servers. You can still set whatever you want in the From header.
</p>

<h2>DKIM, SPF, and DMARC</h2>

<p>
You should prove that your emails actually come from your domain to make your mail trustworthy and deliver to Gmail and co. That’s what DKIM is for, and fortunately it’s a one-time deal per email domain. First you generate a key pair for each domain with OpenDKIM, and then you publish the public key in a TXT record in DNS. The keys don’t expire automatically, but it’s best practice to rotate them periodically. My config uses a naming scheme that allows smooth rotation, but it doesn’t complicate things if you skip it.
</p>

<p>
There are two more TXT records that you need to publish in DNS: the SPF and DMARC records. You say which hosts are allowed to send mail from your email domain, and give instructions to other email servers about what to do with mail that fails DKIM checks. In my case I told others to reject mail that can’t be verified as coming from my domains, and send reports to my postmaster address.
</p>

<p>
Take a look at my OpenDKIM config to understand how things come together.
</p>

</details>

<details>

<pre>127.0.0.1

</details>

<p>
I generate DKIM keys with the following command:
</p>

<pre>opendkim-genkey -D /etc/opendkim/keys/example.com -d example.com -s key1
</pre>

<p>
And for each email domain I have the following records in DNS:
</p>

<div>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Type</th><th>Name</th><th>Value</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>MX</td><td>example.com</td><td>mx.idx.cy</td></tr>
    <tr><td>TXT</td><td>example.com</td><td>v=spf1 mx a -all</td></tr>
    <tr><td>TXT</td><td>key1._domainkey</td><td>v=DKIM1; k=rsa; s=email; p=&lt;public-key&gt;</td></tr>
    <tr><td>TXT</td><td>_dmarc</td><td>v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:postmaster@idx.cy</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

<h2>Reverse DNS</h2>

<p>
One more thing about email trust. I've read that reverse DNS (PTR record) will boost the reputation of your email server. The thing is that your ISP has to set it up, and I suspect my ISP to reply with a polite "no", so I didn't do it yet. As you'll see in the next section, my email gets delivered to Gmail just fine. GMX and outlook.com also didn't mark my mail as spam. I also managed to sign up to reddit.com using my idx.cy email (I received the verification code without delay).
</p>

<p>
However, if you want wide deliverability, PTR isn't optional.
</p>

<h2>Testing with Gmail</h2>

<p>To try it out, let's send a test mail to Gmail with the sendmail command:</p>

<pre>sendmail -vt &lt; test.mail</pre>

<details>
<summary>test.mail</summary>
<pre>Content-Type: text/html
From: max@idx.cy
To: myaddress@gmail.com
Subject: DKIM test
Test message from idx.cy!
</pre>
</details>

<p>I got the mail instantly and Gmail confirmed TLS encryption.</p>

<img src="https://maxadamski.com/blog/2025/10/test-mail-1.png">

<p>Click "Show original" in Gmail to see the raw mail. There's lots of text in the headers, so let's just focus on passing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC :)</p>

<img src="https://maxadamski.com/blog/2025/10/test-mail-2.png">

<p>You'll also get a mail with a report because of the <tt>-v</tt> option. I receive mail with Heirloom Mail like this:</p>

<pre>You have new mail in /var/mail/max
fool ~ | mailx
Heirloom Mail version 12.5 7/5/10.  Type ? for help.
"/var/mail/max": 1 message 1 new
&gt;N  1 Mail Delivery System  Sat Oct  4 15:40  74/2437  "Mail Delivery Status Report"
</pre>

<p>I use the <tt>p</tt> command to print the mail.</p>

<details>
<summary>&amp; p</summary>
<pre>Message  1:

                   The mail system

&lt;myaddress@gmail.com&gt;: delivery via

</pre>
</details>

<p>Great, everything is working! And I'm feeling the spirit of the 80s thanks to mailx :)</p>

<p>
If something isn't working for you, please double-check your DNS records, and triple-check that TLS certificates are readable by the Postfix user, and that DKIM keys are readable by the OpenDKIM user. Postfix and OpenDKIM logs will also be useful. The OpenDKIM config file is especially unforgiving of typos, so watch out for small mistakes!
</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>
In my next post on email, I'll show you how to use Python to build useful email applications. Thanks for reading!
</p>

<p>
Btw, if you notice anything about my config (or just want to share some thoughts) just email me at <a href="mailto:max@idx.cy">max@idx.cy</a> :)

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p><span>Flock Safety, the police technology company most notable for their extensive network of </span><a href="https://sls.eff.org/technologies/automated-license-plate-readers-alprs"><span>automated license plate readers</span></a><span> spread throughout the United States, is rolling out a new and troubling product that may create headaches for the cities that adopt it: detection of “human distress” via audio. As part of their suite of technologies, Flock has been pushing </span><a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/webinar/introducing-raven"><span>Raven</span></a><span>, their version of </span><a href="https://sls.eff.org/technologies/gunshot-detection"><span>acoustic gunshot detection</span></a><span>. These devices capture sounds in public places and use machine learning to try to identify gunshots and then alert police—but EFF has </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/07/its-time-police-stop-using-shotspotter"><span>long warned</span></a><span> that they are also high powered microphones parked above densely-populated city streets. Cities now have one more reason to follow the lead of </span><a href="https://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/austin-license-plate-readers-ends-privacy-concerns/269-4dc64690-c6c0-4ace-a009-fd8a13f69113"><span>many other municipalities</span></a><span> and cancel their Flock contracts, before this new feature causes civil liberties harms to residents and headaches for cities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In marketing materials, Flock has been touting new features to their Raven product—including the ability of the device to alert police based on sounds, including “distress.” The </span><a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/distress-early-access"><span>online ad</span></a><span> for the product, which allows cities to apply for early access to the technology, shows the image of police getting an alert for “screaming.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s unclear how this technology works. For acoustic gunshot detection, generally the microphones are looking for sounds that would signify gunshots (though in practice they often mistake car backfires or fireworks for gunshots). Flock needs to come forward now with an explanation of exactly how their new technology functions. It is unclear how these devices will interact with state “</span><a href="https://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/RECORDING-CONVERSATIONS-CHART.pdf"><span>eavesdropping</span></a><span>” laws that limit listening to or recording the private conversations that often take place in public.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Flock is no stranger to causing legal challenges for the cities and states that adopt their products. In Illinois, Flock was </span><a href="https://www.25newsnow.com/2025/08/28/hundreds-police-departments-use-camera-company-accused-breaking-state-law/"><span>accused of violating state law</span></a><span> by allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a federal agency, access to license plate reader data taken within the state. That’s not all. In 2023, a North Carolina judge halted the installation of Flock cameras statewide for </span><a href="https://www.govtech.com/public-safety/north-carolina-judge-halts-alpr-deployment-over-licensing"><span>operating in the state without a license</span></a><span>. When the city of Evanston, Illinois recently canceled its contract with Flock, it ordered the company to take down their license plate readers–only for Flock to </span><a href="https://evanstonroundtable.com/2025/09/25/city-covers-up-flock-cameras-while-waiting-for-removal/"><span>mysteriously reinstall</span></a><span> them a few days later. This city has now sent Flock a cease and desist order and in the meantime, has put </span><a href="https://evanstonroundtable.com/2025/09/25/city-covers-up-flock-cameras-while-waiting-for-removal/"><span>black tape over the cameras</span></a><span>. For some, the technology isn’t worth its mounting downsides. As one </span><a href="https://derekeder.com/blog/why-i-voted-to-cancel-flock"><span>Illinois village trustee wrote </span></a><span>while explaining his vote to cancel the city’s contract with Flock, “According to our own Civilian Police Oversight Commission, over 99% of Flock alerts do not result in any police action.”</span></p>
<p><br><span>Gunshot detection technology is dangerous enough as it is—police showing up to alerts they think are gunfire only to find children playing with fireworks is a recipe for innocent people to get hurt. This isn’t hypothetical: in Chicago a </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/responding-shotspotter-police-shoot-child-lighting-fireworks"><span>child really was shot at by police</span></a><span> who thought they were responding to a shooting thanks to a ShotSpotter alert. Introducing a new feature that allows these pre-installed Raven microphones all over cities to begin listening for human voices in distress is likely to open up a whole new can of unforeseen legal, civil liberties, and even bodily safety consequences. </span></p>

<p><em>Lucent’s revenue peaked at $37.92B in 1999 , crashed 69% to $11.80B by 2002 , never recovered. Merged with Alcatel in 2006.</em></p>
<p>In 1999 , Lucent Technologies reached $37.92 billion in revenue at the peak of the dot-com bubble. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Lucent was the #1 North American telecommunications equipment manufacturer with 157,000 employees &amp; dominated markets alongside Nortel Networks (combined 53% optical transport market share). <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Behind the scenes , equipment makers extended billions in vendor financing to telecom customers. Lucent committed <strong>$8.1B</strong><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> , Nortel extended $3.1B with $1.4B outstanding , &amp; Cisco promised $2.4B in customer loans.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>The strategy seemed brilliant : lend money to cash-strapped telecom companies so they could buy your equipment. Everyone wins—until the merry-go-round stops.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="nvidias-playbook">Nvidia’s Playbook</h2>
<p>Fast forward to 2025. Nvidia’s vendor financing strategy totals <strong>$110 billion in direct investments</strong> plus another <strong>$15+ billion in GPU-backed debt</strong>. The largest commitment is $100B to OpenAI (September 2025)<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> , structured as 10 tranches of $10B each tied to infrastructure deployment milestones. The first $10B was valued at a $500B OpenAI valuation , with subsequent tranches priced at prevailing valuations. Payment comes via lease arrangements , not upfront GPU purchases. OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar confirmed : “Most of the money will go back to Nvidia”<sup id="fnref1:14"><a href="#fn:14" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Beyond OpenAI , Nvidia holds a $3B stake in CoreWeave<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> , a company that has spent $7.5B on Nvidia GPUs , &amp; $3.7B in other AI startup investments<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> through NVentures.</p>
<p>The GPU-backed debt market adds another layer. CoreWeave alone carries $10.45B in debt using GPUs as collateral<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. An additional $10B+ in GPU-backed debt has emerged for “Neoclouds” including Lambda Labs ($500M GPU-backed loan)<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Lucent in 1999-2000 had vendor financing commitments of $8.1B (20% of $41.4B revenue). Nvidia’s direct investments total 85% of annual revenue ($110B against $130B). Nvidia’s exposure is 4x larger relative to revenue than Lucent’s official outstanding loans , though Lucent’s off-balance-sheet guarantees masked the true exposure.</p>

<p>Cerno Capital raises the question : “Are these policies a reflection of genuine economic &amp; technological realities? Or are these policies a lever by which hyperscalers are enhancing the optics of their investment programs amid rising investor concerns?”<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="4-the-use-of-spvs">4. The Use of SPVs</h3>
<p>Tech companies use Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) to finance AI datacenter construction. A hyperscaler like Meta partners with a private equity firm like Apollo , contributing capital to a separate legal entity that builds &amp; owns the datacenter.</p>
<p>As investor Paul Kedrosky explains : “I have a stake in it as Meta. Some giant private debt provider has a stake in it. The datacenter is under my control. But I don’t own it, so you don’t get to roll it back into my balance sheet.”<sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>*</p>
<p><strong>The Structure</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Entity Creation</strong> : Hyperscaler &amp; PE firm form separate legal entity (SPV)</li>
<li><strong>Capital Structure</strong> : Typically 10-30% equity, 70-90% debt from private credit markets</li>
<li><strong>Lease Agreement</strong> : SPV leases capacity back to hyperscaler</li>
<li><strong>Balance Sheet Treatment</strong> : SPV debt doesn’t appear on hyperscaler’s balance sheet</li>
</ol>
<p>The hyperscaler maintains operational control through long-term lease agreements. Because it doesn’t directly own the SPV , the debt remains off its balance sheet under current accounting standards.</p>
<p>The appeal is straightforward. “I don’t want the credit rating agencies to look at what I’m spending. I don’t want investors to roll it up into my income statement.”<sup id="fnref2:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>*</p>
<p><strong>Market Scale</strong></p>
<p>American tech companies are projected to spend $300-400 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025. Hyperscaler capital expenditures have reached approximately 50% of operating income<sup id="fnref3:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, levels historically associated with government infrastructure buildouts rather than technology companies.</p>
<p><strong>Where the Risk Sits</strong></p>
<p>Datacenter assets now represent 10-22% of major REIT portfolios<sup id="fnref4:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> , up from near zero two years ago. The thin equity layer (10-30%) means if datacenter utilization falls short of projections or if GPUs depreciate faster than projected , equity holders face losses before debt holders experience impairment.</p>
<p><em>*Quotes lightly edited for clarity &amp; brevity</em></p>
<h3 id="5-custom-silicon-threat">5. Custom Silicon Threat</h3>
<p>Hyperscalers are building their own AI accelerators to reduce Nvidia dependence. Microsoft aims to use “mainly Microsoft silicon” , specifically Maia accelerators , in datacenters.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> Google deploys <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu">TPUs</a> , Amazon builds <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium/">Trainium</a> &amp; <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/inferentia/">Inferentia</a> chips , &amp; Meta develops <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/next-generation-meta-training-inference-accelerator-AI-MTIA/">MTIA</a> processors. If customers shift to in-house silicon , CoreWeave’s GPU collateral value &amp; Nvidia’s vendor financing become exposure to customers building competitive alternatives.</p>

<h2 id="what-im-watching">What I’m Watching</h2>
<p>Is AI demand real (like cloud computing) or speculative (like dot-com fiber)?</p>
<p>Here’s what I’m watching :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>GPU utilization rates</strong> : Are data centers actually using the chips or just stockpiling?</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI’s monetization</strong> : Can they generate enough revenue to justify the buildout?</li>
<li><strong>Debt defaults</strong> : Any cracks in the $15B GPU-backed debt market?</li>
<li><strong>AR trends</strong> : AR improved from 68% (FY24) to 30% (Q2 FY26) , but still watch for deterioration</li>
<li><strong>Customer adds</strong> : Are new customers emerging , or is Nvidia dependent on the same 2-4 hyperscalers?</li>
<li><strong>Custom silicon threat</strong> : Microsoft developing Maia accelerators , aiming to use “mainly Microsoft silicon in the data center.”<sup id="fnref1:33"><a href="#fn:33" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> If hyperscalers shift to in-house chips , Nvidia’s vendor financing becomes exposure to customers building competitive alternatives.</li>
<li><strong>Vendor consolidation</strong> : Many companies are in a period of experimentation trying 2-3 competing vendors. Those experimental budgets may thin with time , reducing overall spend.</li>
</ol>
<p>AI is already broadly deployed—40% of US employees used AI at work by September 2025 , double the 20% rate in 2023.<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> Questions persist about effectiveness : the oft cited MIT study found 95% of AI pilots failed to deliver measurable P&amp;L impact , primarily due to poor integration rather than technical failures.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup></p>
<p>Yet the pace of improvement is tremendous. Labor market data shows wages rising twice as fast in AI-exposed industries , &amp; workers using AI boost performance up to 40%.<sup id="fnref1:40"><a href="#fn:40" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> Many of Nvidia’s customers are profitable &amp; sophisticated hyperscalers—Microsoft , Google , Amazon , Meta—generating $451B in operating cash flow in 2024 , with tremendous pull from their own enterprise customers demanding AI. OpenAI is not profitable , reporting a $4.7B loss in H1 2025 on $4.3B revenue , though nearly half the loss is stock-based compensation.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup></p>
<p>Unlike the telecom bubble , where demand was speculative &amp; customers burned cash , this merry-go-round has paying riders.</p>

<h2 id="coda--lucents-accounting-fraud">Coda : Lucent’s Accounting Fraud</h2>
<p>Behind the vendor financing disaster was systematic accounting fraud.

<p>Reserve Manipulation : Lucent improperly established &amp; maintained excess reserves to smooth earnings , violating GAAP.<sup id="fnref5:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The SEC charged 10 Lucent executives with securities fraud.<sup id="fnref6:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> The company paid a $25 million fine—the largest ever for failing to cooperate with an SEC investigation.<sup id="fnref7:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> The accounting manipulation masked deteriorating fundamentals until too late.</p>
<p>The WinStar Collapse : Lucent committed $2 billion in vendor financing to WinStar Communications , a CLEC. When WinStar struggled , Lucent refused a final $90 million loan extension.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>A friend called me last week. Someone who’d built web applications back for a long time before moving exclusively to backend and infra work. He’d just opened a modern React codebase for the first time in over a decade.</p>

<p>“What the hell is this?” he asked. “What are all these generated class names? Did we just… cancel the cascade? Who made the web work this way?”</p>

<p>I laughed, but his confusion cut deeper than he realized. He remembered a web where CSS cascaded naturally, where the DOM was something you worked <em>with</em>, where the browser handled routing, forms, and events without twenty abstractions in between. To him, our modern frontend stack looked like we’d declared war on the platform itself.</p>

<p>He asked me to explain how we got here. That conversation became this essay.</p>

<p><strong>A disclaimer before we begin</strong>: This is one perspective, shaped by having lived through the first browser war. I applied <code>pngfix.js</code> to make 24-bit PNGs work in IE6. I debugged hasLayout bugs at 2 AM. I wrote JavaScript when you couldn’t trust <code>addEventListener</code> to work the same way across browsers. I watched jQuery become necessary, then indispensable, then legacy. I might be wrong about some of this. My perspective is biased for sure, but it also comes with the memory that the web didn’t need constant reinvention to be useful.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>There’s a strange irony at the heart of modern web development. The web was born from documents, hyperlinks, and a cascading stylesheet language. It was always messy, mutable, and gloriously side-effectful. Yet over the past decade, our most influential frontend tools have been shaped by engineers chasing functional programming purity: immutability, determinism, and the elimination of side effects.</p>

<p>This pursuit gave us powerful abstractions. React taught us to think in components. Redux made state changes traceable. TypeScript brought compile-time safety to a dynamic language. But it also led us down a strange path. A one where we fought against the platform instead of embracing it. We rebuilt the browser’s native capabilities in JavaScript, added layers of indirection to “protect” ourselves from the DOM, and convinced ourselves that the web’s inherent messiness was a problem to solve rather than a feature to understand.</p>

<p>The question isn’t whether functional programming principles have value. They do. The question is whether applying them dogmatically to the web (a platform designed around mutability, global scope, and user-driven chaos) made our work better, or just more complex.</p>

<h2 id="the-nature-of-the-web">The Nature of the Web</h2>

<p>To understand why functional programming ideals clash with web development, we need to acknowledge what the web actually is.</p>

<p><strong>The web is fundamentally side-effectful.</strong> CSS cascades globally by design. Styles defined in one place affect elements everywhere, creating emergent patterns through specificity and inheritance. The DOM is a giant mutable tree that browsers optimize obsessively; changing it directly is fast and predictable. User interactions arrive asynchronously and unpredictably: clicks, scrolls, form submissions, network requests, resize events. There’s no pure function that captures “user intent.”</p>

<p><strong>This messiness is not accidental.</strong> It’s how the web scales across billions of devices, remains backwards-compatible across decades, and allows disparate systems to interoperate. The browser is an open platform with escape hatches everywhere. You can style anything, hook into any event, manipulate any node. That flexibility and that refusal to enforce rigid abstractions is the web’s superpower.</p>

<p>When we approach the web with functional programming instincts, we see this flexibility as chaos. We see globals as dangerous. We see mutation as unpredictable. We see side effects as bugs waiting to happen. And so we build walls.</p>

<h2 id="enter-functional-programming-ideals">Enter Functional Programming Ideals</h2>

<p>Functional programming revolves around a few core principles: functions should be pure (same inputs → same outputs, no side effects), data should be immutable, and state changes should be explicit and traceable. These ideas produce code that’s easier to reason about, test, and parallelize, in the right context of course.</p>

<p>These principles had been creeping into JavaScript long before React. Underscore.js (2009) brought map, reduce, and filter to the masses. Lodash and Ramda followed with deeper FP toolkits including currying, composition and immutability helpers. The ideas were in the air: avoid mutation, compose small functions, treat data transformations as pipelines.</p>

<p>React itself started with class components and <code>setState</code>, hardly pure FP. But the conceptual foundation was there: treat UI as a function of state, make rendering deterministic, isolate side effects. Then came Elm, a purely functional language created by Evan Czaplicki that codified the “Model-View-Update” architecture. When Dan Abramov created Redux, he explicitly cited Elm as inspiration. Redux’s reducers are directly modeled on Elm’s update functions: <code>(state, action) =&gt; newState</code>.</p>

<p>Redux formalized what had been emerging patterns. Combined with React Hooks (which replaced stateful classes with functional composition), the ecosystem shifted decisively toward FP. Immutability became non-negotiable. Pure components became the ideal. Side effects were corralled into <code>useEffect</code>. Through this convergence (library patterns, Elm’s rigor, and React’s evolution) Haskell-derived ideas about purity became mainstream JavaScript practice.</p>

<p>In the early 2010s, as JavaScript applications grew more complex, developers looked to FP for salvation. jQuery spaghetti had become unmaintainable. Backbone’s two-way binding caused cascading updates (ironically, Backbone’s documentation explicitly advised against two-way binding saying “it doesn’t tend to be terribly useful in your real-world app” yet many developers implemented it through plugins). The community wanted discipline, and FP offered it: treat your UI as a pure function of state. Make data flow in one direction. Eliminate shared mutable state.</p>

<p>React’s arrival in 2013 crystallized these ideals. It promised a world where <code>UI = f(state)</code>: give it data, get back a component tree, re-render when data changes. No manual DOM manipulation. No implicit side effects. Just pure, predictable transformations.</p>

<p>This was seductive. And in many ways, it worked. But it also set us on a path toward rebuilding the web in JavaScript’s image, rather than JavaScript in the web’s image.</p>

<h2 id="how-fp-purism-shaped-modern-frontend">How FP Purism Shaped Modern Frontend</h2>

<h3 id="css-in-js-the-war-on-global-scope">CSS-in-JS: The War on Global Scope</h3>

<p>CSS was designed to be global. Styles cascade, inherit, and compose across boundaries. This enables tiny stylesheets to control huge documents, and lets teams share design systems across applications. But to functional programmers, global scope is dangerous. It creates implicit dependencies and unpredictable outcomes.</p>

<p>Enter CSS-in-JS: styled-components, Emotion, JSS. The promise was component isolation. Styles scoped to components, no cascading surprises, no naming collisions. Styles become <em>data</em>, passed through JavaScript, predictably bound to elements.</p>

<p>But this came at a cost. CSS-in-JS libraries generate styles at runtime, injecting them into <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags as components mount. This adds JavaScript execution to the critical rendering path. Server-side rendering becomes complicated. You need to extract styles during the render, serialize them, and rehydrate them on the client. Debugging involves runtime-generated class names like <code>.css-1xbq8d9</code>. And you lose the cascade; the very feature that made CSS powerful in the first place.</p>

<p>Worse, you’ve moved a browser-optimized declarative language into JavaScript, a single-threaded runtime. The browser can parse and apply CSS in parallel, off the main thread. Your styled-components bundle? That’s main-thread work, blocking interactivity.</p>

<p>The web had a solution. It’s called a stylesheet. But it wasn’t <em>pure</em> enough.</p>

<p>The industry eventually recognized these problems and pivoted to Tailwind CSS. Instead of runtime CSS generation, use utility classes. Instead of styled-components, compose classes in JSX. This was better, at least it’s compile-time, not runtime. No more blocking the main thread to inject styles. No more hydration complexity.</p>

<p>But Tailwind still fights the cascade. Instead of writing <code>.button { padding: 1rem; }</code> once and letting it cascade to all buttons, you write <code>class="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500"</code> on every single button element. You’ve traded runtime overhead for a different set of problems: class soup in your markup, massive HTML payloads, and losing the cascade’s ability to make sweeping design changes in one place.</p>

<p>And here’s where it gets truly revealing: when Tailwind added support for nested selectors using <code>&amp;</code> (a feature that would let developers write more cascade-like styles), parts of the community revolted. David Khourshid (creator of XState) <a href="https://x.com/DavidKPiano/status/1969054758318051432">shared examples</a> of using nested selectors in Tailwind, and the backlash was immediate. Developers argued this defeated the purpose of Tailwind, that it brought back the “problems” of traditional CSS, that it violated the utility-first philosophy.</p>

<p>Think about what this means. The platform has cascade. CSS-in-JS tried to eliminate it and failed. Tailwind tried to work around it with utilities. And when Tailwind cautiously reintroduced a cascade-like feature, developers who were trained by years of anti-cascade ideology rejected it. We’ve spent so long teaching people that the cascade is dangerous that even when their own tools try to reintroduce platform capabilities, they don’t want them.</p>

<p>We’re not just ignorant of the platform anymore. We’re ideologically opposed to it.</p>

<h3 id="synthetic-events-abstracting-away-the-platform">Synthetic Events: Abstracting Away the Platform</h3>

<p>React introduced synthetic events to normalize browser inconsistencies and integrate events into its rendering lifecycle. Instead of attaching listeners directly to DOM nodes, React uses event delegation. It listens at the root, then routes events to handlers through its own system.</p>

<p>This feels elegant from a functional perspective. Events become data flowing through your component tree. You don’t touch the DOM directly. Everything stays inside React’s controlled universe.</p>

<p>But native browser events already work. They bubble, they capture, they’re well-specified. The browser has spent decades optimizing event dispatch. By wrapping them in a synthetic layer, React adds indirection: memory overhead for event objects, translation logic for every interaction, and debugging friction when something behaves differently than the native API.</p>

<p>Worse, it trains developers to avoid the platform. Developers learn React’s event system, not the web’s. When they need to work with third-party libraries or custom elements, they hit impedance mismatches. <code>addEventListener</code> becomes a foreign API in their own codebase.</p>

<p>Again: the web had this. The browser’s event system is fast, flexible, and well-understood. But it wasn’t <em>controlled</em> enough for the FP ideal of a closed system.</p>

<h3 id="client-side-rendering-and-hydration-reinventing-the-browser">Client-Side Rendering and Hydration: Reinventing the Browser</h3>

<p>The logical extreme of “UI as a pure function of state” is client-side rendering: the server sends an empty HTML shell, JavaScript boots up, and the app renders entirely in the browser. From a functional perspective, this is clean. Your app is a deterministic function that takes initial state and produces a DOM tree.</p>

<p>From a web perspective, it’s a disaster. The browser sits idle while JavaScript parses, executes, and manually constructs the DOM. Users see blank screens. Screen readers get empty documents. Search engines see nothing. Progressive rendering which is one of the browser’s most powerful features, goes unused.</p>

<p>The industry noticed. Server-side rendering came back. But because the mental model was still “JavaScript owns the DOM,” we got <em>hydration</em>: the server renders HTML, the client renders the same tree in JavaScript, then React walks both and attaches event handlers. During hydration, the page is visible but inert. Clicks do nothing, forms don’t submit.</p>

<p>This is architecturally absurd. The browser already rendered the page. It already knows how to handle clicks. But because the framework wants to own all interactions through its synthetic event system, it must re-create the entire component tree in JavaScript before anything works.</p>

<p>The absurdity extends beyond the client. Infrastructure teams watch in confusion as every user makes <em>double the number of requests</em>: the server renders the page and fetches data, then the client boots up and fetches the exact same data again to reconstruct the component tree for hydration. Why? Because the framework can’t trust the HTML it just generated. It needs to rebuild its internal representation of the UI in JavaScript to attach event handlers and manage state.</p>

<p>This isn’t just wasteful, it’s expensive. Database queries run twice. API calls run twice. Cache layers get hit twice. CDN costs double. And for what? So the framework can maintain its pure functional model where all state lives in JavaScript. The browser had the data. The HTML had the data. But that data wasn’t in the right <em>shape</em>. It wasn’t a JavaScript object tree, so we throw it away and fetch it again.</p>

<p>Hydration is what happens when you treat the web like a blank canvas instead of a platform with capabilities. The web gave us streaming HTML, progressive enhancement, and instant interactivity. We replaced it with JSON, JavaScript bundles, duplicate network requests, and “please wait while we reconstruct reality.”</p>

<h3 id="the-modal-problem-teaching-malpractice-as-best-practice">The Modal Problem: Teaching Malpractice as Best Practice</h3>

<p>Consider the humble modal dialog. The web has <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code>, a native element with built-in functionality: it manages focus trapping, handles Escape key dismissal, provides a backdrop, controls scroll-locking on the body, and integrates with the accessibility tree. It exists in the DOM but remains hidden until opened. No JavaScript mounting required. It’s fast, accessible, and battle-tested by browser vendors.</p>

<p>Now observe what gets taught in tutorials, bootcamps, and popular React courses: build a modal with <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements. Conditionally render it when <code>isOpen</code> is true. Manually attach a click-outside handler. Write an effect to listen for the Escape key. Add another effect for focus trapping. Implement your own scroll-lock logic. Remember to add ARIA attributes. Oh, and make sure to clean up those event listeners, or you’ll have memory leaks.</p>

<p>You’ve just written 100+ lines of JavaScript to poorly recreate what the browser gives you for free. Worse, you’ve trained developers to <em>not even look</em> for native solutions. The platform becomes invisible. When someone asks “how do I build a modal?”, the answer is “install a library” or “here’s my custom hook,” never “use <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code>.”</p>

<p>The teaching is the problem. When influential tutorial authors and bootcamp curricula skip native APIs in favor of React patterns, they’re not just showing an alternative approach. They’re actively teaching malpractice. A generation of developers learns to build inaccessible <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> soup because that’s what fits the framework’s reactivity model, never knowing the platform already solved these problems.</p>

<p>And it’s not just bootcamps. Even the most popular component libraries make the same choice: shadcn/ui builds its Dialog component on Radix UI primitives, which use <code>&lt;div role="dialog"&gt;</code> instead of the native <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> element. There are open GitHub issues requesting native <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> support, but the implicit message is clear: it’s easier to reimplement the browser than to work with it.</p>

<h3 id="when-frameworks-cant-keep-up-with-the-platform">When Frameworks Can’t Keep Up with the Platform</h3>

<p>The problem runs deeper than ignorance or inertia. The frameworks themselves increasingly struggle to work with the platform’s evolution. Not because the platform features are bad, but because the framework’s architectural assumptions can’t accommodate them.</p>

<p>Consider why component libraries like Radix UI choose <code>&lt;div role="dialog"&gt;</code> over <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code>. The native <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> element manages its own state: it knows when it’s open, it handles its own visibility, it controls focus internally. But React’s reactivity model expects all state to live in JavaScript, flowing unidirectionally into the DOM. When a native element manages its own state, React’s mental model breaks down. Keeping <code>isOpen</code> in your React state synchronized with the <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> element’s actual open/closed state becomes a nightmare of refs, effects, and imperative calls. Precisely what React was supposed to eliminate.</p>

<p>Rather than adapt their patterns to work with stateful native elements, library authors reimplement the entire behavior in a way that fits the framework. It’s architecturally easier to build a fake dialog in JavaScript than to integrate with the platform’s real one.</p>

<p>But the conflict extends beyond architectural preferences. Even when the platform adds features that developers desperately want, frameworks can’t always use them.</p>

<p>Accordions? The web has <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code>. Tooltips? There’s <code>title</code> attribute and the emerging <code>popover</code> API. Date pickers? <code>&lt;input type="date"&gt;</code>. Custom dropdowns? The web now supports styling <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements with <code>appearance: base-select</code> and <code>::picker(select)</code> pseudo-elements. You can even put <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements with images inside <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> elements now. It eliminates the need for the countless JavaScript select libraries that exist solely because designers wanted custom styling.</p>

<p>Frameworks encourage conditional rendering and component state, so these elements don’t get rendered until JavaScript decides they should exist. The mental model is “UI appears when state changes,” not “UI exists, state controls visibility.” Even when the platform adds the exact features developers have been rebuilding in JavaScript for years, the ecosystem momentum means most developers never learn these features exist.</p>

<p>And here’s the truly absurd part: even when developers <em>do</em> know about these new platform features, the frameworks themselves can’t handle them. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Customizable_select">MDN’s documentation</a> for customizable <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements includes this warning: “<strong>Some JavaScript frameworks block these features; in others, they cause hydration failures when Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is enabled.</strong>” The platform evolved. The HTML parser now allows richer content inside <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> elements. But React’s JSX parser and hydration system weren’t designed for this. They expect <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> to only contain text. Updating the framework to accommodate the platform’s evolution takes time, coordination, and breaking changes that teams are reluctant to make.</p>

<p>The web platform added features that eliminate entire categories of JavaScript libraries, but the dominant frameworks can’t use those features without causing hydration errors. The stack that was supposed to make development easier now lags behind the platform it’s built on.</p>

<h3 id="routing-and-forms-javascript-all-the-way-down">Routing and Forms: JavaScript All the Way Down</h3>

<p>The browser has native routing: <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags, the History API, forward/back buttons. It has native forms: <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> elements, validation attributes, submit events. These work without JavaScript. They’re accessible by default. They’re fast.</p>

<p>Modern frameworks threw them out. React Router, Next.js’s router, Vue Router; they intercept link clicks, prevent browser navigation, and handle routing in JavaScript. Why? Because client-side routing feels like a pure state transition: URL changes, state updates, component re-renders. No page reload. No “lost” JavaScript state.</p>

<p>But you’ve now made navigation depend on JavaScript. Ctrl+click to open in a new tab? Broken, unless you carefully re-implement it. Right-click to copy link? The URL might not match what’s rendered. Accessibility tools that rely on standard navigation patterns? Confused.</p>

<p>Forms got the same treatment. Instead of letting the browser handle submission, validation, and accessibility, frameworks encourage JavaScript-controlled forms. Formik, React Hook Form, uncontrolled vs. controlled inputs; entire libraries exist to manage what <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> already does. The browser can validate <code>&lt;input type="email"&gt;</code> instantly, with no JavaScript. But that’s not <em>reactive</em> enough, so we rebuild validation in JavaScript, ship it to the client, and hope we got the logic right.</p>

<p>The web had these primitives. We rejected them because they didn’t fit our FP-inspired mental model of “state flows through JavaScript.”</p>

<h2 id="what-we-lost-in-the-process">What We Lost in the Process</h2>

<p>Progressive enhancement used to be a best practice: start with working HTML, layer on CSS for style, add JavaScript for interactivity. The page works at every level. Now, we start with JavaScript and work backwards, trying to squeeze HTML out of our component trees and hoping hydration doesn’t break.</p>

<p>We lost built-in accessibility. Native HTML elements have roles, labels, and keyboard support by default. Custom JavaScript widgets require <code>aria-*</code> attributes, focus management, and keyboard handlers. All easy to forget or misconfigure.</p>

<p>We lost performance. The browser’s streaming parser can render HTML as it arrives. Modern frameworks send JavaScript, parse JavaScript, execute JavaScript, then finally render. That’s slower. The browser can cache CSS and HTML aggressively. JavaScript bundles invalidate on every deploy.</p>

<p>We lost simplicity. <code>&lt;a href="/about"&gt;</code> is eight characters. A client-side router is a dependency, a config file, and a mental model. <code>&lt;form action="/submit" method="POST"&gt;</code> is self-documenting. A controlled form with validation is dozens of lines of state management.</p>

<p>And we lost alignment with the platform. The browser vendors spend millions optimizing HTML parsing, CSS rendering, and event dispatch. We spend thousands of developer-hours rebuilding those features in JavaScript, slower.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-happened">Why This Happened</h2>

<p>This isn’t a story of incompetence. Smart people built these tools for real reasons.</p>

<p>By the early 2010s, JavaScript applications had become unmaintainable. jQuery spaghetti sprawled across codebases. Two-way data binding caused cascading updates that were impossible to debug. Teams needed discipline, and functional programming offered it: pure components, immutable state, unidirectional data flow. For complex, stateful applications (like dashboards with hundreds of interactive components, real-time collaboration tools, data visualization platforms) React’s model was genuinely better than manually wiring up event handlers and tracking mutations.</p>

<p>The FP purists weren’t wrong that unpredictable mutation causes bugs. They were wrong that the solution was avoiding the platform’s mutation-friendly APIs instead of learning to use them well. But in the chaos of 2013, that distinction didn’t matter. React worked. It scaled. And Facebook was using it in production.</p>

<p>Then came the hype cycle. React dominated the conversation. Every conference had React talks. Every tutorial assumed React as the starting point. CSS-in-JS became “modern.” Client-side rendering became the default. When big companies like Facebook, Airbnb, Netflix and others adopted these patterns, they became industry standards. Bootcamps taught React exclusively. Job postings required React experience. The narrative solidified: this is how you build for the web now.</p>

<p>The ecosystem became self-reinforcing through its own momentum. Once React dominated hiring pipelines and Stack Overflow answers, alternatives faced an uphill battle. Teams that had already invested in React by training developers, building component libraries, establishing patterns are now facing enormous switching costs. New developers learned React because that’s what jobs required. Jobs required React because that’s what developers knew. The cycle fed itself, independent of whether React was the best tool for any particular job.</p>

<p>This is where we lost the plot. Somewhere in the transition from “React solves complex application problems” to “React is how you build websites,” we stopped asking whether the problems we were solving actually needed these solutions. I’ve watched developers build personal blogs with Next.js. Sites that are 95% static content with maybe a contact form, because that’s what they learned in bootcamp. I’ve seen companies choose React for marketing sites with zero interactivity, not because it’s appropriate, but because they can’t hire developers who know anything else.</p>

<p>The tool designed for complex, stateful applications became the default for everything, including problems the web solved in 1995 with HTML and CSS. A generation of developers never learned that most websites don’t need a framework at all. The question stopped being “does this problem need React?” and became “which React pattern should I use?” The platform’s native capabilities like progressive rendering, semantic HTML, the cascade, instant navigation are now considered “old-fashioned.” Reinventing them in JavaScript became “best practices.”</p>

<p>We chased functional purity on a platform that was never designed for it. And we built complexity to paper over the mismatch.</p>

<h2 id="the-way-forward">The Way Forward</h2>

<p>The good news: we’re learning. The industry is rediscovering the platform.</p>

<p>HTMX embraces HTML as the medium of exchange. Server sends HTML, browser renders it, no hydration needed. Qwik resumable architecture avoids hydration entirely, serializing only what’s needed. Astro defaults to server-rendered HTML with minimal JavaScript. Remix and SvelteKit lean into web standards: forms that work without JS, progressive enhancement, leveraging the browser’s cache.</p>

<p>These tools acknowledge what the web is: a document-based platform with powerful native capabilities. Instead of fighting it, they work with it.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean abandoning components or reactivity. It means recognizing that <code>UI = f(state)</code> is a useful model <em>inside</em> your framework, not a justification to rebuild the entire browser stack. It means using CSS for styling, native events for interactions, and HTML for structure and then reaching for JavaScript when you need interactivity beyond what the platform provides.</p>

<p>The best frameworks of the next decade will be the ones that feel like the web, not in spite of it.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In chasing functional purity, we built a frontend stack that is more complex, more fragile, and less aligned with the platform it runs on. We recreated CSS in JavaScript, events in synthetic wrappers, rendering in hydration layers, and routing in client-side state machines. We did this because we wanted predictability, control, and clean abstractions.</p>

<p>But the web was never meant to be pure. It’s a sprawling, messy, miraculous platform built on decades of emergent behavior, pragmatic compromises, and radical openness. Its mutability isn’t a bug. It’s the reason a document written in 1995 still renders in 2025. Its global scope isn’t dangerous. It’s what lets billions of pages share a design language.</p>

<p>Maybe the web didn’t need to be purified. Maybe it just needed to be understood.</p>
