            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://thirty-five.com/overengineered-anchoring">https://thirty-five.com/overengineered-anchoring</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43570324">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-wrapper">  <p>Anchor links are deceptively simple at first glance: click a button, scroll to the heading, and done. But if you ever had to implement them, you might have encountered the <astro-island uid="Z2kKYgx" component-url="/_astro/tile-creator.CDert_z5.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.DwCUistV.js" props="{&quot;slot&quot;:[0,&quot;tile-slot&quot;],&quot;color&quot;:[0,&quot;red&quot;],&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;component-tile-lm24m68ldyj&quot;],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;“active anchor problem”&quot;],&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;component&quot;],&quot;forceAspectRatio&quot;:[0,false]}" ssr="" client="only" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;TileCreator&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;react&quot;}" await-children=""><template data-astro-template=""><astro-island uid="1JX5wf" component-url="/_astro/AnchorProblem.GGiwfq1Z.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.BBblIl08.js" props="{}" ssr="" client="only" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;AnchorProblem&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;vue&quot;}"></astro-island></template><!--astro:end--></astro-island>.
The issue being that, headings towards the bottom of the page can be too far down to scroll them to the desired position. The example component above shows how the ‘conclusion’ heading can never be reached.
Surely this will be detrimental to the user experience. We need to come up with a solution. In this blog post, I’ll show some of the solutions I’ve come up with — from a hotfix all the way to unhinged. But before we do that, let’s create a more <astro-island uid="Z1MksBG" component-url="/_astro/tile-creator.CDert_z5.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.DwCUistV.js" props="{&quot;slot&quot;:[0,&quot;tile-slot&quot;],&quot;color&quot;:[0,&quot;green&quot;],&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;component-tile-5t0ccesj14q&quot;],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;abstract visualization&quot;],&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;component&quot;],&quot;forceAspectRatio&quot;:[0,false]}" ssr="" client="only" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;TileCreator&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;react&quot;}" await-children=""><template data-astro-template=""><astro-island uid="Z2ucBWu" component-url="/_astro/PageViewportVisualization.Cjt7_c79.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.BBblIl08.js" props="{&quot;version&quot;:[0,&quot;default&quot;]}" ssr="" client="only" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;PageViewportVisualization&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;vue&quot;}"></astro-island></template><!--astro:end--></astro-island>. Here, we see a viewport moving down the page, with the trigger line being set at 25vh from the top of the viewport. This is what we’ll use to visualize the different solutions.</p>

<p>The most simple solution is to add <astro-island uid="27A0Xm" component-url="/_astro/tile-creator.CDert_z5.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.DwCUistV.js" props="{&quot;slot&quot;:[0,&quot;tile-slot&quot;],&quot;color&quot;:[0,&quot;green&quot;],&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;component-tile-rge2ndsw839&quot;],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;extra\npadding.&quot;],&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;component&quot;],&quot;forceAspectRatio&quot;:[0,false]}" ssr="" client="only" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;TileCreator&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;react&quot;}" await-children=""><template data-astro-template=""><astro-island uid="12OCzC" component-url="/_astro/PageViewportVisualization.Cjt7_c79.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.BBblIl08.js" props="{&quot;version&quot;:[0,&quot;extra-padding&quot;]}" ssr="" client="only" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;PageViewportVisualization&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;vue&quot;}"></astro-island></template><!--astro:end--></astro-island> We calculate the height of the padding by taking the delta between the last
heading and the lowest point the anchor trigger can reach. Perfect, right? Well, sometimes the
design team is not so fond of random extra padding, so lets keep searching.</p>
<h2 id="practical-shift-the-trigger-line">Practical: shift the trigger line</h2>
<p>Maybe instead of adding extra padding, <astro-island uid="qP9nn" component-url="/_astro/tile-creator.CDert_z5.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.DwCUistV.js" props="{&quot;slot&quot;:[0,&quot;tile-slot&quot;],&quot;color&quot;:[0,&quot;green&quot;],&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;component-tile-jtcl7bygbvh&quot;],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;shift the\ntrigger line.&quot;],&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;component&quot;],&quot;forceAspectRatio&quot;:[0,false]}" ssr="" client="only" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;TileCreator&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;react&quot;}" await-children=""><template data-astro-template=""><astro-island uid="Gvykj" component-url="/_astro/PageViewportVisualization.Cjt7_c79.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.BBblIl08.js" props="{&quot;version&quot;:[0,&quot;shift-triggers&quot;]}" ssr="" client="only" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;PageViewportVisualization&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;vue&quot;}"></astro-island></template><!--astro:end--></astro-island> This is also quite simple to do, we just need to calculate how far
from the bottom the last heading is, and put the trigger line there as well. But, this would mean
that when the users clicks an anchor tag, the heading could be put all the way at the bottom of the
viewport. This is of course not great, since most people put the text they read on the top half of
the screen. We need to keep looking.</p>
<h2 id="good-translate-the-trigger-points">Good: translate the trigger points</h2>
<p>Instead of shifting the trigger line, we could <astro-island uid="D59lS" component-url="/_astro/tile-creator.CDert_z5.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.DwCUistV.js" props="{&quot;slot&quot;:[0,&quot;tile-slot&quot;],&quot;color&quot;:[0,&quot;green&quot;],&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;component-tile-3tievcl9v6v&quot;],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;translate&quot;],&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;component&quot;],&quot;forceAspectRatio&quot;:[0,false]}" ssr="" client="only" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;TileCreator&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;react&quot;}" await-children=""><template data-astro-template=""><astro-island uid="dqbkI" component-url="/_astro/PageViewportVisualization.Cjt7_c79.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.BBblIl08.js" props="{&quot;version&quot;:[0,&quot;translate-points&quot;]}" ssr="" client="only" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;PageViewportVisualization&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;vue&quot;}"></astro-island></template><!--astro:end--></astro-island> the headings upwards. Instead of using the actual location of the headings as the ones causing the triggers, we create <strong>virtual headings</strong> and translate them upwards. A virtual heading is not actually visible in the article, its just the position we use to dictate the active state.
One might argue that this is pretty much the same as shifting the trigger line, and they’d be right conceptually. However, thinking about translating the trigger points gives us more mental flexibility, as it allows us to consider applying <em>different</em> adjustments based on each heading’s position, which will be crucial later.</p>
<p><em><strong>The example visualizations now show the location of these ‘virtual headings’. So, while the heading is still at the same place in the article, we visualize where its trigger point is.</strong></em></p>
<p>In the example, we see one problem arising: the first heading is now too far up. The nice part of this new approach is that we can fix this quite elegantly, since we can shift the individual virtual headings with ease. But what would be a good way to do this?</p>
<h2 id="great-translate-trigger-points-fractionally">Great: translate trigger points fractionally</h2>
<p>If we think about it, we don’t need to translate all the trigger points. There’s only a few conditions
that need to be met:</p>
<ol>
<li>The headings need to be reachable.</li>
<li>The headings need to stay in order.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can meet these conditions by translating the trigger points <astro-island uid="1s7jNo" component-url="/_astro/tile-creator.CDert_z5.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.DwCUistV.js" props="{&quot;slot&quot;:[0,&quot;tile-slot&quot;],&quot;color&quot;:[0,&quot;green&quot;],&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;component-tile-q6z2eo6ppnh&quot;],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;fractionally.&quot;],&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;component&quot;],&quot;forceAspectRatio&quot;:[0,false]}" ssr="" client="only" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;TileCreator&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;react&quot;}" await-children=""><template data-astro-template=""><astro-island uid="mlTOP" component-url="/_astro/PageViewportVisualization.Cjt7_c79.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.BBblIl08.js" props="{&quot;version&quot;:[0,&quot;translate-points-fractionally&quot;]}" ssr="" client="only" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;PageViewportVisualization&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;vue&quot;}"></astro-island></template><!--astro:end--></astro-island> Here,
the first heading doesn’t move, and the last heading moves up by the full amount necessary to become reachable. The other headings move up by a proportional amount based on their position between the first and last heading. Now we are getting somewhere! This is a solid solution. You might want to stop here before your product manager starts giving you puzzled looks, wondering how “fixing anchor links” has suddenly turned into a three-week epic.</p>
<h2 id="awesome-create-a-custom-mapping-function">Awesome: create a custom mapping function</h2>
<p>While the fractional solution works, in the sense that our conditions are met, it does have some
flaws. We have chosen a trigger line that’s 25% down from the top of the viewport. It would be nice
if we can actually minimize the deviation from this ideal line across all headings. The closer the triggers happen to this (mind you — semi-arbitrarily chosen) line, the better the user experience <em>should</em> be. Minimizing deviation feels like a good heuristic. This for sure will make the users happier and result in increased shareholder value.</p>
<p>Let’s minimize the <astro-island uid="Z1sJ5Uy" component-url="/_astro/tile-creator.CDert_z5.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.DwCUistV.js" props="{&quot;slot&quot;:[0,&quot;tile-slot&quot;],&quot;color&quot;:[0,&quot;green&quot;],&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;component-tile-15vvr9sn5ml&quot;],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;mean squared error&quot;],&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;component&quot;],&quot;forceAspectRatio&quot;:[0,false]}" ssr="" client="only" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;TileCreator&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;react&quot;}" await-children=""><template data-astro-template=""><astro-island uid="1XpdHr" component-url="/_astro/PageViewportVisualization.Cjt7_c79.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.BBblIl08.js" props="{&quot;version&quot;:[0,&quot;minimize-mse&quot;]}" ssr="" client="only" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;PageViewportVisualization&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;vue&quot;}"></astro-island></template><!--astro:end--></astro-island> (MSE) of the delta between the headings’ original positions and their virtual positions. We use MSE because it heavily penalizes large deviations, pushing the system towards a state where most virtual headings are close to their original spots, while still satisfying our reachability constraints. Of course, the constraint that headings must stay in order still applies.
This results in all points that are reachable staying at their original position. Seems that we have an issue. headings are bunched up at the bottom. This makes sense, since minimization of the mean squared error only cares about proximity to the original position; it has no ‘force’ that opposes this bunching. We need to define something that encourages the virtual trigger points to maintain a certain distance from each other, ideally related to their original spacing. Considering the user experience, we might assume that it’s nice to have the scroll <em>distance</em> needed to activate the next section’s anchor be somewhat proportional to the actual content length of that section. This ‘sections wanting to preserve their relative scroll length’-force is what we’ll use.</p>
<h3 id="side-quest-minimization-functions">Side quest: minimization functions</h3>
<p>To explore this idea we need to bust out… Python.

The core of the optimization lies in a loss function with two competing terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anchor penalty:</strong> How far a virtual heading is moved from its original location. Minimizing this keeps virtual headings close to their original position.

<h3 id="realizations">Realizations</h3>
<p>Staring at that optimization graph sparked a thought. Okay, maybe two thoughts. First, that need to preserve section spacing really kicks in towards the <em>end</em> of the page, where headings get forcibly shoved upwards to stay reachable, squashing the final sections together. Second, let’s consider the behavior of the ‘fractional translation’ method on an edge case.</p>
<p>Imagine, if you will, taking the entire Bible, from the “In the beginning” of Genesis to the final “Amen” of Revelation, and rendering it as one continuous, scrollable webpage. (For the tech bros among us: you could alternatively imagine gluing all of Paul Graham’s essays back-to-back). Now, suppose the very last heading, maybe “Revelation Chapter 22”, is just 200 pixels too low to hit our trigger line when scrolled to.</p>
<p>Does our previous ‘fractional translation’ make sense here? It means taking those 200 pixels of required uplift and meticulously spreading that adjustment across <em>every single heading</em> all the way back to the start. The Ten Commandments get a tiny bump, the Psalms slightly more, all culminating in Revelation 22 getting the full 200px boost.</p>
<p>Actually, if you think about it, with a fractional translation, the error (the distance between the virtual and original headings) grows with the page length. So if the page tends to infinity, so does the error! This would of course be sloppy, and something users could immediately notice as feeling off. So how are we going to fix this?</p>
<h3 id="the-final-version">The final version</h3>
<p>This leads to our desired behavior for a smarter mapping function:</p>
<ul>
<li>For headings near the end of the page, apply more adjustment (act like high <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>w</mi><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">w_{section}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>).</li>
<li>For headings near the beginning of the page, apply less (or ideally no) adjustment (act like high <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>w</mi><mrow><mi>a</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>h</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>r</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">w_{anchor}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>).</li>
<li>The transition between these states should be smooth.</li>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Please note that InitWare is still alpha software</strong>. But all disclosed
security concerns have now been addressed. Running InitWare as an auxiliary
service manager under NetBSD can now, then, be regarded as safe; but beware
relying on this in production until a first stable release is made.</p>
<p dir="auto">The InitWare Suite of Middleware allows you to manage services and system
resources as logical entities called units. It runs on NetBSD, GNU/Linux, and
all the other modern BSD systems.</p>
<p dir="auto">Units are automatically scheduled by a job scheduler according to their
dependency specifications. A user session manager facilitates tracking of users'
login sessions, with each user provided their own dedicated service manager.
Finally the InitWare System Log provides a system-wide event log aggregating
diverse log sources.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Suite may run either as an init system or as an auxiliary service management
system under another init system. InitWare originates as a fork of systemd and
retains compatibility with many systemd interfaces, even on non-Linux platforms.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

  

  <article>
    <p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Deck</a> is a great gaming system. This isn’t because of it’s great battery life. A Nintendo Switch would probably have better battery life. It’s not because of its great performance. I don’t usually play AAA games, so I wouldn’t know. The Steam Deck is great because of the philosophy on which it is built.</p>

<p>The popularity of Steam Decks is directly tied to the betterment of support for games on Linux. This is because the Steam Deck really is a linux computer in a handheld form-factor with a gamepad, among other things, attached to it. According to <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProtonDB</a>, over 5000 PC games are certified Verified on the Steam Deck, and over 15,000 games are considered playable. This means that there are tens of thousands of games that can be run on Linux in some way.</p>

<p>Thanks to Steam’s efforts, the state of compatibility of games on Linux systems have heavily improved. Not all these thousands of games running on the Deck have binaries that run natively on Linux. Pivotal to the success of the Deck is Proton, a middle-layer compatibility software, that makes this (mostly) seamless emulation possible. Nonetheless, the greater the adoption of Decks, the likelier we are to normalize prioritizing game-builds for Linux.</p>

<p>We run software because it serves us some purpose. In this, running software is no different from utilizing everyday objects, and playing games are no different from running software. Yet, this teleological view of computing would miss a lot of context. When picking an operating system, we may want to make a choice that aligns with the goals of transparency or software freedom. But this would not be realistic if the programs we would like to run on top are not supported in such an ecosystem. Since large parts of Proton is open-source, and are released under permissive licenses, gaming on a Deck takes us closer to using a principled software stack for daily use.</p>

<p>Purchasing everyday objects give us ownership over them. With media, software and computing equipment, this is less so. When you buy a book, you may lend it to others, sell it, earmark the pages and even rip it in two if you like. This is very different from the experience of buying a smartphone. You can’t run arbitrary programs of your choice on an Android phone without rooting, or on an iPad or an iPhone without jailbreaking. In most scenarios, you’d be forced to sign away your legal ability to root or jailbreak before you can engage with the device in any meaningful way.</p>

<p>The Steam Deck does not engage in this practice. It runs a heavily customized version of Arch Linux. This means that you can plug in a keyboard and mouse into it, and pretend that it is your desktop computer. If you like, you can install the LibreOffice suite on it, and prepare presentations.</p>

<p>The matter of using your computers the way you like is more than just a symbolic debate about the nature of ownership. It is a political matter of freedom of expression. When they control the apps that you run on your device, they are in charge of deciding which content is Kosher, and which content is obscene. It is also an economic matter of having efficient markets. The mythological power of the free market works only when the consumers can switch between different producers at will. When the operators of the market themselves try to capitalize on chokepoints and direct the consumers to buy products from their allies, this is no longer the case.</p>

<p>Switch owners buy games from the Switch Store not because that is the best market, but because that is the only marketplace from which they can install games. This is thankfully, less of a case with the Steam Deck. The Steam Deck encourages you to buy and play Steam games, of course. Nonetheless, I had <a href="https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no issues</a> installing <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoG</a> or even <a href="https://itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">itch.io</a> launchers on my Deck and playing games from them. The Deck also includes a “non-steam game” tab in its UI to let users conveniently access them.</p>

<p>When your shoe tears up, you are welcome to visit the cobbler of your choice. They all understand the internals of a shoe. And when they need to fix them, they all can gather the nails, glue and the pieces of fabric that they might need. This is less so for many computing products. Many manufacturers try to discourage third party vendors from repairing them. Worse, they sometimes purposely use proprietary parts in their products, replacements of which would be hard to find. Thankfully, Valve has been different. Valve has released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3011210954776539264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a video</a> explaining the internal organization of the Steam Deck and how one should approach replacing parts, should they wish to do so.</p>

<p>This post is not really necessarily about the Steam Deck (or Valve Corporation) itself. That said, the Steam Deck is an excellent demonstration that the commercial interest of making profit does not necessarily have to overpower the civic interests of the people.</p>

<hr>

<p>Valve’s libertarian ideology has not always been an unquestionable force for good. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9aCwCKgkLo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMmNy11Mn7g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people</a> have criticized that their company culture of libertarianism sometimes takes precedence over other important values including equity and inclusion. During the peak of the ‘Black Lives Matter’ movement, Valve was pressured to make a statement. Valve responded by giving each of their employees an amount of money which they were free to donate to a charity of their choice. This was regarded as a non-statement by many since there may have been employees who have donated their shares to an organizations with interests opposing the cause.</p>

<p>Valve has also generally refused to take a stance against gambling websites which plug into their ecosystem, despite the allegation that this harms many users (including minors). This maybe a consequence of their libertarian philosophy, but the worse possibility is that they are disinterested in tuning down a part of their system that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMmNy11Mn7g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">profits themselves</a>.</p>

<p>A very large share of the PC gaming market is Steam, which is a fact I do not admire. They do take a 30% cut on the sales of Steam games, which can arguably be considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rent seeking</a>, even if it is the industry standard. I do hope the marketplace of game distribution sees more healthy competition. Nonetheless, I appreciate Valve for not pursuing aggressively anti-competitive tactics.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
				<p><u>On the foolishness of "natural language programming"</u>.</p>
				<p>Since the early days of automatic computing we have had people that have felt it as a shortcoming that programming required the care and accuracy that is characteristic for the use of any formal symbolism. They blamed the mechanical slave for its strict obedience with which it carried out its given instructions, even if a moment's thought would have revealed that those instructions contained an obvious mistake. "But a moment is a long time, and thought is a painful process." (A.E.Houseman). They eagerly hoped and waited for more sensible machinery that would refuse to embark on such nonsensical activities as a trivial clerical error evoked at the time.</p>
				<p>Machine code, with its absence of almost any form of redundancy, was soon identified as a needlessly risky interface between man and machine. Partly in response to this recognition so-called "high-level programming languages" were developed, and, as time went by, we learned to a certain extent how to enhance the protection against silly mistakes. It was a significant improvement that now many a silly mistake did result in an error message instead of in an erroneous answer. (And even this improvement wasn't universally appreciated: some people found error messages they couldn't ignore more annoying than wrong results, and, when judging the relative merits of programming languages, some still seem to equate "the ease of programming" with the ease of making undetected mistakes.) The (abstract) machine corresponding to a programming language remained, however, a faithful slave, i.e. the nonsensible automaton perfectly capable of carrying out nonsensical instructions. Programming remained the use of a formal symbolism and, as such, continued to require the care and accuracy required before.</p>
				<p>In order to make machines significantly easier to use, it has been proposed (to try) to design machines that we could instruct in our native tongues. this would, admittedly, make the machines much more complicated, but, it was argued, by letting the machine carry a larger share of the burden, life would become easier for us. It sounds sensible provided you blame the obligation to use a formal symbolism as the source of your difficulties. But is the argument valid? I doubt.</p>
				<p>We know in the meantime that the choice of an interface is not just a division of (a fixed amount of) labour, because the work involved in co-operating and communicating across the interface has to be added. We know in the meantime —from sobering experience, I may add— that a change of interface can easily increase at both sides of the fence the amount of work to be done (even drastically so). Hence the increased preference for what are now called "narrow interfaces". Therefore, although changing to communication between machine and man conducted in the latter's native tongue would greatly increase the machine's burden, we have to challenge the assumption that this would simplify man's life.</p>
				<p>A short look at the history of mathematics shows how justified this challenge is. Greek mathematics got stuck because it remained a verbal, pictorial activity, Moslem "algebra", after a timid attempt at symbolism, died when it returned to the rhetoric style, and the modern civilized world could only emerge —for better or for worse— when Western Europe could free itself from the fetters of medieval scholasticism —a vain attempt at verbal precision!— thanks to the carefully, or at least consciously designed formal symbolisms that we owe to people like Vieta, Descartes, Leibniz, and (later) Boole.</p>
				<p>The virtue of formal texts is that their manipulations, in order to be legitimate, need to satisfy only a few simple rules; they are, when you come to think of it, an amazingly effective tool for ruling out all sorts of nonsense that, when we use our native tongues, are almost impossible to avoid.</p>
				<p>Instead of regarding the obligation to use formal symbols as a burden, we should regard the convenience of using them as a privilege: thanks to them, school children can learn to do what in earlier days only genius could achieve. (This was evidently not understood by the author that wrote —in 1977— in the preface of a technical report that "even the standard symbols used for logical connectives have been avoided for the sake of clarity". The occurrence of that sentence suggests that the author's misunderstanding is not confined to him alone.) When all is said and told, the "naturalness" with which we use our native tongues boils down to the ease with which we can use them for making statements the nonsense of which is not obvious.</p>
				<p>It may be illuminating to try to imagine what would have happened if, right from the start our native tongue would have been the only vehicle for the input into and the output from our information processing equipment. My considered guess is that history would, in a sense, have repeated itself, and that computer science would consist mainly of the indeed black art how to bootstrap from there to a sufficiently well-defined formal system. We would need all the intellect in the world to get the interface narrow enough to be usable, and, in view of the history of mankind, it may not be overly pessimistic to guess that to do the job well enough would require again a few thousand years.</p>
				<p><u>Remark</u>. As a result of the educational trend away from intellectual discipline, the last decades have shown in the Western world a sharp decline of people's mastery of their own language: many people that by the standards of a previous generation should know better, are no longer able to use their native tongue effectively, even for purposes for which it is pretty adequate. (You have only to look at the indeed alarming amount of on close reading meaningless verbiage in scientific articles, technical reports, government publications etc.) This phenomenon —known as "The New Illiteracy"— should discourage those believers in natural language programming that lack the technical insight needed to predict its failure. (End of remark.)</p>
				<p>From one gut feeling I derive much consolation: I suspect that machines to be programmed in our native tongues —be it Dutch, English, American, French, German, or Swahili— are as damned difficult to make as they would be to use.</p>

<time datetime="2025-04-01">Published on: April 1, 2025</time>


<p><a href="https://pilledtexts.com/images/screenshots/screenshot_20250401_231923.jpg"><img src="https://pilledtexts.com/images/screenshots/screenshot_20250401_231923.jpg" alt="Portrait of Nassim Nicholas Taleb" width="150"></a></p>
<blockquote>
If a book has been in print for forty years, I can expect it to be in print for another forty years. But, and that is the main difference, if it survives another decade, then it will be expected to be in print another fifty years. This, simply, as a rule, tells you why things that have been around for a long time are not "aging" like persons, but "aging" in reverse. Every year that passes without extinction doubles the additional life expectancy. This is an indicator of some robustness. The robustness of an item is proportional to its life<p>
― Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Antifragile
</p></blockquote>
<p>Nassim Nicholas Taleb contrasts <strong>fragile</strong> systems—those that suffer serious harm under volatility—with <strong>robust</strong> systems that can endure stress with minimal damage. He extends this concept with <strong>antifragile</strong> systems, which can actually benefit from disorder, but we’ll focus here on the divide between fragile and robust.</p>
<p>Taleb also introduces the <strong>Lindy Effect</strong> as an idea about longevity: if something non-perishable has been around for a long time, that track record suggests it’s likely to keep going. We’ll see how this relates to two laptops—one from 2008, the other from 2021.</p>
<p><a href="https://pilledtexts.com/images/screenshots/screenshot_20250402_021001.jpg"><img src="https://pilledtexts.com/images/screenshots/screenshot_20250402_021001.jpg" alt="My t400 Thinkpad" width="150"></a></p>
<h2 id="old-thinkpads-modular-robust-survivors">Old Thinkpads: Modular, Robust Survivors</h2>
<p>IBM and early Lenovo Thinkpads showcases a design built for longevity. Despite their age, these business-class laptop are still serviceable and useful for web browsing, ‘office work’, and light coding. These machine are too slow to handle tasks like video editing or gaming, but they remain consistent in handling everyday tasks without failing under normal wear and tear.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons that old Thinkpads stand out is their <strong>design philosophy</strong>. They are made with swappable components with the intention of user upgradeability. The battery, RAM, storage drive, keyboard, and even the CPU can be easily replaced. I can open the bottom of my T400 with a regular screwdriver and clean the fan. A battery swap is trivial thanks to a removable pack. No single failure is catastrophic because there’s a straightforward path to replacement or repair.</p>
<p>The <strong>build quality</strong> greatly contributes to old Thinkpads robustness. They are made with a sturdy chassis with plastic and magnesium alloy elements, giving it a solid feel. The design absorbs bumps and small impacts without major issues. They can easily take accidental knocks and remain fully operational.</p>
<p>Old Thinkpads benefits from an <strong>open ecosystem</strong>. They uses standard PC architecture (x86), so installing various operating systems is easy. On the hardware side, replacement parts are widely available on the secondary market. This broad compatibility keeps the machine relevant long past its original release date. By Taleb’s Lindy Effect, the fact that my T400 can still work well after so many years suggests <strong>it’s likely to remain functional as people have already figured out the ways to significantly extend its lifespan</strong>.</p>
<p>All these factors show how the my Thinkpad is <strong>robust</strong>: it resists sudden failures, and when problems do arise, their are documented way to fit it. Old beat up Thinkpads are Lindy.</p>
<p><a href="https://pilledtexts.com/images/screenshots/screenshot_20250402_222549.jpg"><img src="https://pilledtexts.com/images/screenshots/screenshot_20250402_222549.jpg" alt="My t400 Thinkpad" width="150"></a></p>
<h2 id="modern-macbooks-high-performance-but-fragile">Modern MacBooks: High Performance, But Fragile</h2>
<p>My MacBook offers exceptional speed and efficiency an order of magnitude more than my Thinkpad. It handles tasks—like video editing or running large LLM’s without breaking a sweat. Under ideal conditions, it’s reliable and powerful.</p>
<p>However, from a Talebian perspective, my MacBook’s design is <strong>fragile</strong>. Most components of the laptop are soldered onto the logic board. If the SSD or RAM fails, there’s no simple replacement option. A single failure in a component of my MacBook can render the entire laptop unusable. The tightly integrated design of modern Apple hardware increases the stakes of any malfunction.</p>
<p>The <strong>repairability</strong> of Apple products is extremely limited. Apple uses proprietary screws and adhesives, and parts are incompatible with third-party replacements. A battery replacement (usually one of the first things that fails in mobile electronics) involves carefully prying out a glued component. Routine maintenance tasks that are straightforward on the Thinkpad can require specialized tools and authorized service for the MacBook. This lack of modularity means the system can easily become bricked from hardware fails from component parts.</p>
<p>Another aspect contributing to the fragility of MacBooks is Apple’s <strong>software control</strong>. Apple’s software updates and security updates to macOS essentially determines how long the MacBook remains safe to use. Once Apple ends official support for a machine the user has to buy a new MacBook or use an increasingly compromised system. Apple hardware uses an arm architecture that cannot ‘dual boot’ Windows or Linux easily. Once macOS support dies for a modern MacBook it becomes obsolete.</p>
<p>While my MacBook is great to use, the machine has a lifespan built into its OS support and cannot recover easily from physical damage. MacBooks are not modular, completely proprietary, and have a perishability built into them. Additionally (this is true of all new laptops), when something does go wrong with a new MacBook it hard to fix as <strong>it’s not old enough for people to have figured out if their are ways to extend its lifespan as none have broke yet</strong>. Shiny Macbooks are not very Lindy.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>My Thinkpad is robust because it can face stress (e.g. a broken part, a needed upgrade) without losing its core functionality. It’s modular and benefits from it being old enough that other people know how to extend its lifespan. If something breaks, I replace it. If I need a new feature, I can potentially slot it in. My MacBook despite its phenomenal power, is fragile: if Apple discontinues support or a soldered part dies, there is not much I can do. There is not a knowledge base yet on how to significantly extend the life of these Apple Silicon machines, and there likely never will because of the machines inherent lack of modality.</p>
<p>Right now I’m using both my Macbook and my Thinkpad a lot. I continue to use my MacBook because I like using proprietary software like Camtasia or Alfred, I like being able to use local LLM’s, and I enjoy the modern screen and ports that my MacBooks has. But if I had to guess which machine I will still be using in another 17 years I’d point to my ThinkPad with its battery latch and standard screws; I see no reason why it will not be able to manage email management, website development, and internet browsing indefinitely.</p>

Law firms are warning that denial rates for high-skilled visas could<b> </b>rise, as they did during President Donald Trump’s first term. And the administration’s efforts to end automatic citizenship for those born<b> </b>in the U.S. is making immigrant tech workers fear that their future children could be stateless.</p></div><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2JIXTLYKNFEJFBLLH6J7KOHP6A" data-el="text" dir="null">In recent weeks, the government has also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/03/09/columbia-arrest-mahmoud-khalil/" target="_blank">revoked visas and green cards</a> of people it accuses of sympathizing with Hamas and Hezbollah, adding to the uncertainty for people who until now thought following immigration rules and being employed in high-tech industries meant they could confidently build lives in America.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WZXUSQONGZEWFLIMTGJEBETJEA" data-el="text" dir="null">“What we’re seeing right now is just a lot of worry and panic,” said Malcolm Goeschl, principal attorney for Goeschl Law, a San Francisco-based firm focused on business immigration that serves clients in the tech industry. “It seems like [the administration is] just getting more and more momentum, and we don’t know what’s around the corner.”</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NHJRXMMRIJGNJN5B5NGAUEQGPQ" data-el="text" dir="null">The uncertainty and fear are rattling Silicon Valley’s immigrant tech community, long viewed as one of the key pillars of success in producing innovative technology and boosting U.S. competitiveness. A 2018 study from the National Foundation for American Policy, a think tank focused on trade and immigration, found that more than half of U.S. start-ups valued at more than $1 billion had an immigrant founder or co-founder. The CEOs of Microsoft, Google, Uber and chip giant Nvidia are all immigrants. Experts say cutting the visas for immigrant tech workers could damage the industry’s ability to compete with China in the global race to develop sophisticated technology such as artificial intelligence.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5SHWZAUX7RBSXKX4Q3RC5AF77U" data-el="text" dir="null">“That’s just the beauty of our tech ecosystem — that you can hire the best and brightest from anywhere,” said Divyansh Kaushik, a vice president at think tank Beacon Global Strategies who advises tech companies on geopolitical risks.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ITUHI6OVYRE27MA4UHPYSINULM" data-el="text" dir="null">Silicon Valley tech giants employ thousands of workers on H1B visas, the visa category at the center of the debate. About 65,000 visas are approved each year via a lottery system, with people coming from India having the highest number of approvals, followed by China and Canada, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Among Big Tech companies, Amazon had the highest number of H1B visas approved, followed by Google, Meta, Microsoft and Apple. Tesla, whose CEO Elon Musk has been leading Trump’s efforts to cut the federal government, had 1,767 approved H1Bs in the fiscal year ending in September 2024.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y2UD3HDX35AYHMQJE4I3NWPRGI" data-el="text" dir="null">Spokespeople for Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5JEHXPJQIJCB5N6LOT5CTKAIFY" data-el="text" dir="null">The H1B visa can be used by a wide range of workers with specialized skill sets. Many Americans associate the visa with IT outsourcing firms that use it to bring workers from India and China at a cheaper cost than paying U.S. workers.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7S5O722KOJFNPI7EEPB34IZIRI" data-el="text" dir="null">IT outsourcing companies such as Infosys and Cognizant account for a large portion of H1B applications, but Big Tech companies are among the top 10 biggest employers of H1B holders as well. In Silicon Valley, the visa is generally seen as a key tool for filling the relentless demand for top engineering talent, with H1B workers sometimes considered less likely to switch jobs because transferring the visa from one employer to another requires approval from the government.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WJ5TBRHPLBFARCML3JX7Z4SEMI" data-el="text" dir="null">H1B visas have opened up a rift inside Trump’s coalition, between tech leaders whose companies employ immigrants and others who want to slow immigration to the U.S. That rift erupted in December when the two sides argued on X over whether Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/27/h-1b-visas-elon-musk-trump-immigration/" target="_blank">should boost or suppress</a> skilled immigration.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WGYW7THFT5GGNAFWRWZWXUQ7QU" data-el="text" dir="null">“The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low,” Musk wrote on X on Christmas. “If you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be.” Some Republicans, including former presidential hopeful Nikki Haley, pushed back, saying the country should invest in U.S. education to train more American-born tech workers.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A5PZLKSZIVEVJEDVUX23RYZZHU" data-el="text" dir="null">Trump hasn’t said he will end the H1B program or other skilled visas.

Musk immigrated also, from South Africa, via Canada, in his 20s.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LJ3Y5FYK4FGZHGPOC5XMTDHZIU" data-el="text" dir="null">Still, the unpredictability is already leading major immigration law firms to warn about the risk of sudden changes to visa rules, the potential for processing times to slow, and increased scrutiny of applicants’ political views and social media activity.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7UI5O6LE5ZFJJHX5LBZMTIQQ3Q" data-el="text" dir="null">“In the past Trump administration, the statistics show that it was less nice to skilled immigration despite everything they said,” said Deedy Das, an investor at venture capital firm Menlo Ventures. He said he’s concerned that legitimate criticisms of the H1B program — such as the fact that some IT consulting firms have been accused of visa fraud — could lead to the government scrapping the entire program.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FLWP6ZBIK5DZFFVDZ2IMA3IUBI" data-el="text" dir="null">A spokesperson for the White House did not provide a comment.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VMXV7NYBWZG5PE66ZYEW2OQYPA" data-el="text" dir="null">Concerns about Trump’s impact on immigrant tech workers were growing even before he took office.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7NA4FIO6XNBGNJHBFDF462W5LE" data-el="text" dir="null">Late last year, law firms working for Google and Amazon warned the companies’ employees with visas to think twice before traveling abroad, out of concern they might not be allowed back into the U.S., according to documents obtained by The Washington Post. Denial rates for skilled visas spiked to 15 percent during the first Trump administration, and law firms warn that the same will probably happen now.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GUCYREGTMVDMXMGDEWFTF476BM" data-el="text" dir="null">Immigration attorneys are ramping up one-on-ones with workers, hosting company town halls, and providing written FAQs for companies to disseminate to their workers. In some cases, attorneys are giving blanket advice such as telling workers to carry their immigration documents, keep their address and job information up to date with authorities, stay connected with their attorneys and HR representatives, and be careful about social media posts.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7FFTOXPFPBAXBICB4EGHGZJOSE" data-el="text" dir="null">“Everything will be under a heightened level of scrutiny, and people should be prepared for that,” said Audrea Golding, a Silicon Valley-based partner at the law firm Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen &amp; Loewy who represents small and medium-size companies in tech, pharmaceuticals and biotech.</p><p data-qa="article-body"><h3 data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="I3RZ6UQBXJCNBKNHNZYUW6RGAY" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="I3RZ6UQBXJCNBKNHNZYUW6RGAY"><b>Difficult path to the ‘American Dream’</b></h3></p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UOT6IT56GJBKVPG2LZOOM5XMOQ" data-el="text" dir="null">Every year, thousands of students travel to the U.S. to study computer science and other tech subjects at prestigious universities. The best among them compete for entry-level jobs at tech companies willing to apply for H1Bs once their student-work visas expire. Once they secure an H1B, they can begin the path to a green card. But for people from some countries, especially India, there is such a backlog of green card applicants that many wait years or even decades before getting permanent status.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D57Y7ZCJMZF2JMQH3HR3V4Y72A" data-el="text" dir="null">In October, the CEO of fast-rising AI company Perplexity, Aravind Srinivas, <a href="https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/1851700699756925059?lang=en" target="_blank">posted on X</a> that he has been waiting for a green card for three years, despite founding and building a company recently valued at $9 billion that employs hundreds of people.</p><p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IY6T2OUSGFFXFCJ27TRWIAK7NQ" data-el="text" dir="null">“People mostly have no idea when they talk about immigration,” Srinivas posted on X.

<p>"So, is everyone losing their minds yet?" </p>

<p>My ex-coworker asked me over yahoo messenger. He quit after getting enraged by new work policies that specifically targeted him. I looked up from my screen, and saw that the team of developers who used to work alongside my ex-coworker were now silently working on their respective machines in the row next to me. His old monitor had been taken away. His tower was sitting on the now open office desk, collecting its first coat of dust. </p>

<p>"Yes. It's complete chaos." I replied. Well, I lied. It wasn't chaos. They weren't happy either. The reality was that his old team was indifferent. They missed him of course, he was a great guy. I missed him, he was a true friend in this chaotic world of technology. But the fact that he was the only .Net developer in the entire company went unnoticed.</p>

<p>By himself, he maintained multiple money making websites. They all ran on a brittle .Net infrastructure. He knew all there was to know about them, and would respond in seconds whenever they experienced an issue. There was no realistic way to replace my ex-coworker, the .Net developer, and there were no plans in place to address this issue. He was hired to write code, so the best way to get back at a company who didn't value him, was to stop writing code. So he quit.</p>

<p>"lol the website is down," he wrote to me the next day. I checked and he was right, the website was down. I looked in the next row and it was complete silence. A whole hour passed and I was getting nervous. Not a single person in his old team was talking about it. I sent a message to one of them. "Hey I think your website is down." </p>

<p>"Oh, you are right." She answered. "I'll investigate." </p>

<p>After lunch, The QA guy in Mexico sent me a message on AIM, asking if I knew the credentials to the server. I shared the credentials. Then he said "Is SSH disabled on this server? It just times out."</p>

<p>"It's a windows server," I answered. "You have to use RDP to connect."</p>

<p>"Oh boy! I never used a Windows server before."</p>

<p>I helped him access the server and went on my way. Before the day was over, the website was back up. He was later promoted and became the new .Net guy. The QA guy in Mexico resolved the issue by simply restarting the machine.</p>

<p>My old friend, once a crucial part of the organization, was no longer needed. They built a new UI written in PHP and plugged the same database. Not only was he replaced, but now his position had been phased out. .Net was no longer a thing in the company. The promoted employee in Mexico was soon let go.</p>

<hr>

<p>I thought I had been hired for my ability to write code as well. I posed as the JavaScript guru. Everyone consulted with me before deploying any code. In 2011, you needed an expert to guarantee your code would run on the plethora of broken browsers. We wouldn't dream of the tools available today. I was that expert. Yet when I left, my team moved on.</p>

<p>Despite my skills as a JavaScript developer, my position had been gradually diluted into a larger team of developers who were capable of handling the job just fine.</p>

<p>I was once proud of my self-developed methods for testing my scripts across various browsers and effectively implementing feature detection. However, the company eventually switched to using jQuery instead of my custom-built methods. Similarly, my custom tools were replaced with a third-party vendor's offering. While I was previously the go-to person for building new features, I was unable to contribute to the implementation of Angular due to my lack of experience with it. </p>

<p>I was proudest of an A/B testing suite I built for the company. It rivaled Google's Web Optimizer, and it was customizable. It ran both on the server side and the client side. It was the result of years of internal feedback and fine tuning. I even made a fun little logo for it. One day, a new manager came in and said we should use VWO as an alternative to Google's. And that was it. My work was tossed away without a second thought.</p>

<p>If they had hired me to write code, or if my old friend was hired to maintain what was exotic code, then why was it so easy to discard it?</p>

<p>I later realized that in the fast-paced tech industry, companies prioritize delivering products and features above all else. Managers are responsible for delivering results to higher-ups. As such, it is crucial for developers to work on building and maintaining the company's products and features, regardless of their coding specializations.</p>

<p>My experiences as a consultant further highlighted the importance of delivering visual results to clients and stakeholders. I often spent night and day fixing bugs and performance issues only for the company to ask me if I did any work. But when I produced "A Subscription Model" or "An Architecture" or "A build system" these were highly praised. Even though they came in as a PowerPoint instead of working code. They would hand it over to a team to write the code later, if ever.</p>

<p>Does it mean that we shouldn't write code or shouldn't try to get better at it? Not at all. When working in a team, what matters most is that the weakest developer be at the very least competent. The rest is to try to build and maintain the company's product and features.</p>

<p>Not as fun or inspiring as we make the programming world to be. But the reality is we are not hired to write code. That's only incidental.</p>

<p dir="auto">Tailscale is <a href="https://tailscale.com/" rel="nofollow">a modern VPN</a> built on top of
<a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" rel="nofollow">Wireguard</a>.
It <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/" rel="nofollow">works like an overlay network</a>
between the computers of your networks - using
<a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/" rel="nofollow">NAT traversal</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Everything in Tailscale is Open Source, except the GUI clients for proprietary OS
(Windows and macOS/iOS), and the control server.</p>
<p dir="auto">The control server works as an exchange point of Wireguard public keys for the
nodes in the Tailscale network. It assigns the IP addresses of the clients,
creates the boundaries between each user, enables sharing machines between users,
and exposes the advertised routes of your nodes.</p>
<p dir="auto">A <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1136/tailnet/" rel="nofollow">Tailscale network (tailnet)</a> is private
network which Tailscale assigns to a user in terms of private users or an
organisation.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Design goal</h2><a id="user-content-design-goal" aria-label="Permalink: Design goal" href="#design-goal"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Headscale aims to implement a self-hosted, open source alternative to the
<a href="https://tailscale.com/" rel="nofollow">Tailscale</a> control server. Headscale's goal is to
provide self-hosters and hobbyists with an open-source server they can use for
their projects and labs. It implements a narrow scope, a <em>single</em> Tailscale
network (tailnet), suitable for a personal use, or a small open-source
organisation.</p>

<li>In the game, when hosting a new lobby, just make sure to set the server to <strong>Use Local Lan Server</strong> (AoE II),
select <strong>LAN</strong> before creating the Lobby (AoE III) or select the "LAN" menu option (AoE I). In AoE I/II, setting it
to

            <span>Abstract:</span>Soft attention is a critical mechanism powering LLMs to locate relevant parts within a given context. However, individual attention weights are determined by the similarity of only a single query and key token vector. This "single token attention" bottlenecks the amount of information used in distinguishing a relevant part from the rest of the context. To address this issue, we propose a new attention method, Multi-Token Attention (MTA), which allows LLMs to condition their attention weights on multiple query and key vectors simultaneously. This is achieved by applying convolution operations over queries, keys and heads, allowing nearby queries and keys to affect each other's attention weights for more precise attention. As a result, our method can locate relevant context using richer, more nuanced information that can exceed a single vector's capacity. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that MTA achieves enhanced performance on a range of popular benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms Transformer baseline models on standard language modeling tasks, and on tasks that require searching for information within long contexts, where our method's ability to leverage richer information proves particularly beneficial.

The FAQ explains that the assembly will be performed by an “assembly pro” from “one of our trusted partners, Wayfair Home Services or Angi.” Assemblers are “background-checked and highly rated by customers.” All you have to do is add-on assembly when you buy the bed, then schedule it using the app. </p><p>So Jane paid $84.99 and scheduled assembly for the day after delivery. The boxes were dropped by FedEx at the wrong apartment door, a common occurrence with FedEx in this area, and Jane’s elderly neighbor had to push them down the hallway to her door. The next day, the Angi assembler arrived and began assembly. After several hours, the assembler told Jane she couldn’t finish: Wayfair had sent the wrong part. </p><p>Jane sent a photo of the bed to Wayfair, who promised to send a replacement part. But then the photo made its way to the Wayfair parts department, where someone looked closer: it wasn’t the wrong part. The assembler had just assembled the bed incorrectly. </p><p>Jane got in touch with Angi and asked for a new assembler to come  reassemble the bedframe. She kindly requested that they send a different person than they’d sent before. A few hours later, Jane received notification that her assembly had been scheduled. With the same assembler. Who then failed to show up for the appointment. </p><p>She was at wit’s end. She cancelled the assembly. She’ll eventually have the $84.99 refunded, but only after she fills out an online form and waits several weeks for a check to arrive in the mail. </p><p>Jane was telling a friend about the whole fiasco, and they volunteered to come reassembly. He quickly discovered that the entire frame had been assembled incorrectly, beginning with step one. The Angi assembler was probably good at all sorts of other things in her life. But she was not good at assembling. </p><p><span>Jane’s bedframe saga reminded me of a conversation I was having with a </span><em>different</em><span> friend last weekend, about the Apple Store’s inability to get her iPhone to ring with an incoming call. After a two hour phone call and a visit to the store, the phone remained broken. She started trying different Google queries —&nbsp;and fixed it herself. </span></p><p>After that conversation, I checked our island NextDoor to see that several FedEx packages had either been delivered to bushes or the wrong house —&nbsp;a frequent occurrence. Soon thereafter, my prescription was refilled incorrectly. At Fred Meyer, our local Kroger-owned grocery store, a bagger in his 70s put all my frozen items in a normal bag, and my chips in the cold storage bag I’d brought from home. </p><p><span>Small stuff, all of it. None of it super inconveniencing. But a series of inconveniences add up. Maybe you’ve experienced something similar over the last few years, contributing to a vague conviction that </span><em>people are bad at their jobs</em><span>. </span></p><p><em>People are bad at their jobs</em><span> is a sibling, of course, to </span><em>no one wants to work anymore</em><span>: the refrain of peak pandemic years. But both are deflections from what actually makes people “bad” at their jobs —&nbsp;or disincentivizes people to work. The truth is: </span><em>the jobs are bad</em><span>. </span></p><p><span>What makes a job bad? Take a look at Angi, which, like food delivery apps, Thumbtack, Taskrabbit, Instacart, and hundreds of other “gig economy” employers, promises consumers cheap ease: just a few clicks, and some part of your life will be easier. In reality, the business model that creates both the cheapness and the ease makes the end product significantly worse: the only way the company can make a profit is by taking a significant cut off the top of the service and by exclusively hiring part-time “independent contractors” (and thus circumventing labor laws; economist David Weil calls this phenomenon “</span><a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674975446" rel="">the fissured workplace</a><span>.”) </span></p><p><span>As a result, the majority of people who sign-up to do the work are making very little money. At Angi, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wayfair/comments/yf5mr3/do_not_use_wayfair_professional_assembly/" rel="">assemblers report making around $25 for a single assembly</a><span>. A bed is scheduled to take two hours. Add in transportation, gas, and/or parking costs, and you’re making less than minimum wage ($16.66 in Washington State). So who’s doing this work? Someone who’s desperate for some control over their schedule. Someone who’s desperate, generally. Not someone who can market their skills themselves — like a local handyperson, working for themselves, who’d charge their hourly rate (mine charges $50 an hour) or a local furniture assembly specialist (the one I called charges $150 minimum for assembly; more for a larger project). </span></p><p>If you wanted to reverse engineer a job to ensure that the people doing it would do it badly, you’d build something like Angi. It doesn’t provide training. It doesn’t provide tools. It doesn’t provide benefits, or job security, or anything close to a living wage. If you get better at assembling, or if you’re so good you amass a client base, you can bet you’re not doing those jobs through Angi anymore. </p><p><span>Or take the example of FedEx —&nbsp;delivering to the wrong door and throwing packages in the bushes. We’ll start with FedEx’s primary competitor: UPS. UPS is </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/11/1193448000/ups-union-negotiated-a-historic-contract-now-workers-have-the-final-say" rel="">unionized</a><span> and directly employs its hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers. The average pay for a UPS driver is $95,000 a year, plus over $50,000 in healthcare and pension contributions. Part-time workers receive the same benefits. Working for UPS is a </span><em>good job</em><span> —&nbsp;and that’s part of why UPS workers are </span><em>good at their jobs</em><span>. </span></p><p>Delivering for FedEx, by contrast, is a bad job. It subcontracts its routes to smaller entities that then hire their own drivers; a scrape of job listings for drivers shows an average pay of $22 an hour. Most subcontractors pay their drivers using a “fixed daily rate,” which means they’re paid the same no matter how long the work takes. If they’re done early, they go home early; if they take longer, they’re not paid overtime. For a route like the one here on the island, they’re not receiving any extra pay for the time spent waiting in the ferry line on both sides. </p><p>It’s a bad job, which is part of the reason we have new drivers all the time — drivers who don’t know the island, or where to leave packages, but are desperate to finish the route as soon as possible. Again, the parameters of the job itself make it far more likely for whoever’s doing it to be “bad” at it. </p><p><span>Then there’s the botched prescription refill. I use the Walgreens Pharmacy out of convenience —&nbsp;but Walgreens, like every other chain pharmacy in the US, has been significantly understaffed for years. Chain pharmacies are now forced to negotiate with Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), who serve as middlemen between insurance companies and the pharmacies themselves, ostensibly saving insurees millions by negotiating lower prices from the pharmacies themselves. In practice, PMBs save </span><em>the insurance company</em><span> millions —&nbsp;but not necessarily the insuree, who, even if they do save a few dollars on a prescription, is paying for “low cost” drugs by spending endless hours on hold or in line to get their prescription filled. </span></p><p><span>At the same time, the non-pharmacy parts of the drugstores themselves are </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/18/why-walgreens-cvs-retail-pharmacies-are-struggling.html" rel="">pulling in less money</a><span>, placing even more pressure on the pharmacy as a profit center. Thousands of chain pharmacies have closed since the pandemic, effectively funneling more customers into fewer outposts. (Or, as happened with me, the PMB that represented my insurance company offered my previous pharmacy at Fred Meyer a “take it or leave it” deal; when Fred Meyer declined, I could no longer have my prescriptions filled there. Hence: Walgreens, along with thousands of other local residents who can no longer fill their prescriptions at Fred Meyer). </span></p><p>More customers + more pressure to create profit + stagnant wages = fewer employees working more hours for less pay, which also leads to burnout —&nbsp;and people being bad at their jobs. And as for working in an environment that effectively forces you to be bad at something you’re good at —&nbsp;that leads people to leave the industry altogether. Cue: even more understaffing, even more pressure on the people who remain, and a much higher likelihood of a prescription renewal getting screwed up. </p><p>Okay, but what about the Fred Meyer bagger? Working at Fred Meyer is actually a pretty okay job: you start at minimum wage (again, $16 an hour here in Washington) and then get bumped up when you become part of the union. A full-time gig offers full medical benefits, paid vacation and sick leave, even Sunday overtime ($1 more an hour). </p><p><span>The vast majority of baggers I encounter are actually quite good at their job, but I also encounter fewer and fewer baggers, because Fred Meyer has decided that the best way to lower costs is to only have one checkout with an actual checker open and funnel all other customers to self check-out. This particular bagger was bad at this job because he probably shouldn’t be working this job, but it’s one of the few jobs available to someone who has to work into their 70s. (The bagger couldn’t get hired at Costco, which is right across the street and </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/bigs/costco-and-other-retailers-prove-a-good-jobs-strategy-works" rel="">a very good job</a><span>). </span></p><p>As for my friend’s iPhone —&nbsp;well, working at the Apple Store is also a good job. Even if you start at the bottom of the pay scale, they promote from within, offer full health benefits for full-time employees, 401k matching, and stock discounts. The Genius Bar appointment system is unrivaled. I recently messed up my computer and since I live two hours from the nearest Genius Bar, they sent me an overnight box (via FedEx, that time they got the delivery right) to ship it to them, did the repair, and shipped it back (also via FedEx, but this package didn’t get here overnight because the weekend delivery person couldn’t find my front door. Yes, she was new.) </p><p><span>Sometimes the product is just weird —&nbsp;or, as we used to say about certain cars, a </span><em>lemon</em><span>. But we’ve had enough experiences with people in bad jobs that it sure feels like everyone, no matter the industry, is doing bad work. We blame it on lack of ambition, lack of pride, laziness, rudeness, </span><em>whatever</em><span>, because it’s always easier to blame the individual who made our life difficult, instead of the systems that don’t just foster but incentivize bad work. </span></p><p>As a society, we have decided that we want more for less: more convenience, more purchases, more technology, but none of it at prices that render it out of reach. For years, we allowed immediate gratification to blind ourselves to the reality that making something cheaper and more accessible almost always makes it worse. It didn’t matter if the shirt fell apart or the couch collapsed — you could always buy a new one and survive on the glow of its novelty until it had to be replaced as well. </p><p>The exploitation (of workers, of natural resources) that made that abundant cheapness possible was largely invisible and thus ignorable. Some people paid the time tax and figured out new homes for their discarded items, but most people pile it into Goodwill or the dumpster, telling themselves a story about how it’d find a second life, or telling themselves nothing at all. </p><p><span>A badly made pair of sandals is annoying but survivable. But people being bad at their jobs </span><em>in your everyday life</em><span> is far more difficult to ignore. It adds unanticipated rupture. It blows up your carefully planned day. It exacts a stiff time tax —&nbsp;and while you have money (in part because everything is so cheap!) your time has become far more precious. You’re just standing there in line at Walgreens, stewing about </span><em>how there has to be a better way</em><span>, absolutely indignant that they can’t manage to figure out </span><em>one prescription</em><span> that refills </span><em>every three months</em><span> seriously </span><em>how hard can it be</em><span>. Our hunt for the frictionless deal turns a purchase into a quagmire that takes weeks to fully undo, restore, and solve. </span></p><p>Even if you don’t personally hold these values, the vast majority of us are members of societies that do. But resistance is very possible. If everyone’s good at their job, shop there. If you need help with something, find a local company or self-employed person to pay directly —&nbsp;and tip them. If something feels like a massive deal, someone or some part of the earth is paying steeply for it, and chances are high you will pay more for it (in replacement costs, in labor, in time) later. And if you’re forced to use a company with bad services and bad products, the fault is very rarely the worker themselves, but the organization that makes it so difficult for them to be good at their job. </p><p>I’m not saying we should all spend more money on everything. Or that we should collectively lower our standards and accept shoddy work. I keenly understand that part of the reason we rely on these exploitative services is because we, ourselves, are subject to the demands of the same economy: one that tells us our time is always better spent working or recovering from work, instead of helping others with their bedframe assembly or, say, shopping in person. </p><p>But I do think it’s worth wondering: what would happen, how might the paradigm shift, if we continue normalizing paying far more for far less?  ●</p><p><em><strong>Just want to be clear here that companies and consumers are all part of this —&nbsp;but if you’ve found yourself in the position of buying something like the Wayfair bedframe, I don’t think you’ve done anything wrong. I have ALSO bought a Wayfair bedframe!! (Although my assembly saga was far less fraught than Jane’s). I’m not trying to make anyone feel like shit; instead, I’m trying to have us think about our reactions to “bad” products and “bad” service.</strong></em><strong> </strong></p><p><em>So, for today’s discussion: What have you paid less money for —&nbsp;product-wise, service-wise —&nbsp;but ended up paying more in other ways? What are your strategies for normalizing (receiving) less for (paying) more, particularly in the US, which valorizes (receiving) more for (paying) less? </em></p><p><strong>The comments are, as always, a subscriber-only space; don’t be butts and let’s keep it one of the good places on the internet.</strong></p></div></div>]]></description>

President Trump’s trade policy during his first term. The tariffs he imposed on
China allowed production in those countries to expand, and for them to grow

disadvantaged in this way could cost those companies dearly. They may try to

will President Trump gain the extra revenues he hopes for. If they change their
buying habits, that penalises those trading partners but he doesn’t get that
tariff cash.

        Our mission is to enable developers with services that 
        help them rapidly prototype on the web.  We want to make it
        easier than ever for developers to share their projects with the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our services allow users to publish content without needing to install anything.
        We accomplish this with the SSH tools (<code>rsync</code>, <code>sftp</code>,
        <code>sshfs</code>) you already have installed on your system.
      </p>

      <p>
        Use our platform entirely using SSH and our TUI.

<p><em>Earlier today, CEO Matt Mullenweg shared with Automattic employees the following message.</em></p>



<hr>



<p>I have had to make difficult decisions to protect&nbsp;Automattic’s long-term future. This post will outline why the changes are happening and the next steps in our organizational restructuring. I wish to be transparent and acknowledge immediately that this will be difficult news to hear. We will do everything to ensure that all Automatticians, those staying and those leaving, are supported.</p>



<h2 id="why-we-re-making-changes">Why We’re Making Changes<a href="https://updateomattic.wordpress.com/2025/04/02/restructuring-announcement/#why-we-re-making-changes"></a></h2>



<p>We have reached an important crossroads. While our&nbsp;revenue&nbsp;continues to grow, Automattic operates in a highly competitive market, and technology is evolving at unprecedented levels. To support our customers and products, we must improve our productivity, profitability, and capacity to invest.</p>



<p>As difficult as this decision has been, we are restructuring the company to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Become more agile and responsive.</li>



<li>Break down silos that have created inefficiencies.</li>



<li>Focus on product quality, doing fewer things better.</li>



<li>Ensure a viable financial model for long-term success.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="what-this-means">What This Means<a href="https://updateomattic.wordpress.com/2025/04/02/restructuring-announcement/#what-this-means"></a></h2>



<p>This restructuring will result in an approximately 16% workforce reduction. HR will email those impacted to inform them they will leave Automattic with financial and support benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="supporting-those-affected">Supporting Those Affected<a href="https://updateomattic.wordpress.com/2025/04/02/restructuring-announcement/#supporting-those-affected"></a></h2>



<p>This process is complex with Automatticians in 90 countries, but we’re committed to communicating clearly and compassionately. Colleagues who will be leaving will receive:</p>



<ul>
<li>A comprehensive package covering severance pay and benefits.</li>



<li>Retention of company laptops.</li>



<li>Job placement resources.</li>
</ul>



<p>They also have our enduring gratitude for their time with the company.</p>



<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward<a href="https://updateomattic.wordpress.com/2025/04/02/restructuring-announcement/#looking-forward"></a></h2>



<p>Automattic has multiple products with world-touching potential in WordPress and beyond. I’m confident we will come out of this situation in a better position, poised to create a vibrant, profitable, well-designed company that will continue our mission to democratize the internet. I would ask that you take a moment to thank and appreciate the efforts of your teammates who have left the company, reflect on how you will move forward as an individual and Automattician, and join me in the vital work we have in front of us. I recognize this is a difficult time. In the coming weeks, we’ll share more about our path forward and how we’ll work together to strengthen our company.</p>



<p>We understand that you may wish to access support and discuss this with those close to you. I’d like to remind you that Automattic partners with Workplace Options, which provides emotional and practical well-being support if you seek advice from an external provider.</p>

</ul>



<p>As always, your HR Wranglers are here to talk with you and support you.</p>
