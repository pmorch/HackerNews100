<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article> <div id="markdown-content"> <p><em>tl;dr:</em></p> <ul> <li>Historically, general approaches always win in AI.</li> <li>Founders in AI application space now repeat the mistakes AI researchers made in the past.</li> <li>Better AI models will enable general purpose AI applications. At the same time, the added value of the software around the AI model will diminish.</li> </ul> <p>Recent AI progress has enabled new <code>products</code> that solve a broad range of <code>problems</code>. I saw this firsthand watching over 100 pitches during YC alumni Demo Day. These problems share a common thread - they’re simple enough to be solved with <code>constrained</code> AI. Yet the real power of AI lies in its <code>flexibility</code>. While <code>products</code> with fewer constraints generally work better, current AI <code>models</code> aren’t reliable enough to build such products at scale. We’ve been here before with AI, many times. Each time, the winning move has been the same. AI founders need to learn this history, or I fear they’ll discover these lessons the hard way.</p> <p>In 2019, Richard Sutton started his famous essay “The Bitter Lesson” with:</p> <p>“The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin”.</p> <p>He points out that throughout AI’s history, researchers have repeatedly tried to improve systems by building in human domain knowledge. The “bitter” part of the title comes from what happens next: systems that simply use more computing power end up outperforming these carefully crafted solutions. We’ve seen this pattern in speech recognition, computer chess, and computer vision. If Sutton wrote his essay today, he’d likely add generative AI to that list. And he warns us: this pattern isn’t finished playing out.</p> <p>“As a field, we still have not thoroughly learned it, as we are continuing to make the same kind of mistakes (…). We have to learn the bitter lesson that building in how we think we think does not work in the long run. The bitter lesson is based on the historical observations that 1) AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents, 2) this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but 3) in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and 4) breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation”</p> <p>From an AI research perspective, the Bitter Lesson deals with clear definitions of “better.” In computer chess, it’s your win rate; in speech recognition, it’s word accuracy. But this post looks at AI <code>products</code> in the application layer (see Figure 1), where “better” means both <code>performance</code> and <code>adoption</code> in the market. We’ll cover adoption in Chapter 2. For now, let’s focus on product performance - the amount of economically valuable work a product can replace. Better performance means handling more complex problems, which unlocks more value.</p> <p><img src="https://lukaspetersson.com/assets/img/stack.png" alt="stack"></p> <p><em>Figure 1, illustration of different types of AI products. In this post, we talk about the application layer.</em></p> <p>AI <code>products</code> are typically an AI <code>model</code> wrapped in some <code>packaging software</code>. You can improve their performance in two ways:</p> <ol> <li>Through engineering effort: using domain knowledge to build constraints into the packaging software</li> <li>Through better models: waiting for AI labs to release more capable models</li> </ol> <p>You can pursue both paths, but here’s the crucial insight: as models improve, the value of engineering effort diminishes. Right now, there are huge gains to be made in building better packaging software, but only because current models make many mistakes. As models become more reliable, this will change. Eventually, you’ll just need to connect a model to a computer to solve most problems - no complex engineering required.</p> <p><img src="https://lukaspetersson.com/assets/img/perf-vs-effort.png" alt="perf-vs-effort"></p> <p><em>Figure 2, illustration of the diminishing returns of engineering effort when building AI products in the application layer. The value diminishes both as more engineering effort is made and as better models are released.</em></p> <p>The graph above shows how engineering effort becomes less valuable as models improve. Current models have significant limitations, which means companies can still gain a lot from engineering work. I saw this at YC alumni Demo Day, where companies were finding success. The landscape splits into two groups: those with products in production at scale (solving simple problems) - a small group for now - and those targeting slightly more complex problems. This second group is doing well because their proof-of-concepts suggest their goals are achievable with enough engineering effort.</p> <p>But here’s the key question these companies face: will the next model release make all that engineering work obsolete, destroying their competitive advantage? The launch of OpenAI’s o1 model illustrates this risk. I spoke with many founders in the AI application layer who were worried because they’d invested heavily in perfecting prompts to boost performance. But with o1, prompt engineering matters less. As Figure 2 shows, o1 is smarter, but this means there’s less value in the engineering work these companies did.</p> <p>At its core, this engineering effort aims to constrain AI and reduce its mistakes. From observing many solutions, I’ve identified two main types of constraints:</p> <ul> <li> <code>Specificity</code>: This represents how focused a solution is. A <code>vertical</code> solution has packaging software built for one specific problem. A <code>horizontal</code> product, in contrast, can handle many different types of problems.</li> <li> <code>Autonomy</code>: This measures how independently the AI can operate. Following Anthropic’s terminology, we have <code>workflows</code> - systems where LLMs and tools follow predefined code paths - and <code>agents</code> - systems where LLMs control their own processes and tool usage, deciding how to complete tasks.</li> </ul> <p>These two types of constraints create a framework for categorizing AI products:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>&nbsp;</th> <th><strong>Vertical</strong></th> <th><strong>Horizontal</strong></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Workflow</strong></td> <td>Harvey</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Agent</strong></td> <td>Devin</td> <td>Claude computer-use</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><em>Table 1: Classification of famous AI products. Note that ChatGPT likely follows a predefined code path for each message, making it a workflow rather than an agent.</em></p> <p>Let’s explore how each category might be implemented for the same task: a business analyst creating investment pitch slides. Here’s one possible approach for each:</p> <ul> <li> <code>Vertical</code> <code>workflow</code>: A fixed sequence of steps: First, makes a RAG query on a company database, passes this to a small LLM for summarization, then to a more capable LLM that extracts key numbers and uses a calculator tool. The LLM checks if these numbers make sense before writing slide content. Finally, a slide generator creates the presentation. This exact sequence runs every time.</li> <li> <code>Vertical</code> <code>agent</code>: An LLM runs in a loop, using its output from one iteration as input for the next. It has access to the same tools as the workflow version but decides for itself when to use them. The loop continues until the agent determines the results meet its quality threshold.</li> <li> <code>Horizontal</code> <code>workflow</code>: ChatGPT and similar tools could assist with parts of the task, but can’t complete it end-to-end. They lack both the specialization and autonomy needed for the full job.</li> <li> <code>Horizontal</code> <code>agent</code>: Claude computer-use gets access to standard company software. The analyst provides instructions in natural language, and the agent operates the computer like a human would, adapting its approach as needed.</li> </ul> <p>Almost all products at Demo Day fell into the vertical workflow category. This makes sense - current models aren’t reliable enough for other approaches. As a result, even problems too complex for vertical workflows are being forced into this mold since it’s the only way to get close to acceptable performance with current model capabilities. While engineering can improve these solutions, there’s an upper limit to what it can achieve. For problems that are out of reach with current models, the better strategy would be to wait for more capable models that can handle them with minimal engineering. As Leopold Aschenbrenner argues in “Situational Awareness,” for many problems, the engineering work will take longer than the wait for better models:</p> <p>“It seems plausible that the schlep will take longer than the unhobbling, that is, by the time the drop-in remote worker is able to automate a large number of jobs, intermediate models won’t yet have been fully harnessed and integrated”</p> <p>This pattern should sound familiar. Let’s return to the Bitter Lesson. AI researchers repeatedly tried to engineer their way to “acceptable performance,” only to be overtaken by more general solutions that simply used more compute. The parallel to how today’s AI products are built is striking. And we can make this connection even clearer by examining how the Bitter Lesson applies to our two types of constraints:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Bitter Lesson Observation</th> <th>Autonomy</th> <th>Specificity</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1) AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents</td> <td>The developer experiments with an autonomous agent but finds it unreliable. Instead, they hardcode the execution steps to follow the workflow that they would go through themselves when solving the task.</td> <td>The developer starts building a general document analysis system but finds it unreliable. Instead, they constrain it to just analyze financial statements, hardcoding specific metrics and validation rules.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2) This always helps in the short term and is personally satisfying to the researcher</td> <td>The developer finds that this increases reliability.</td> <td>The developer finds that specialization improves accuracy since the model only needs to handle a narrow set of documents and metrics.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3) In the long run, it plateaus and even inhibits further progress</td> <td>The constrained workflow sometimes does not give the correct output when faced with novel situations that weren’t considered in the hardcoded steps.</td> <td>The specialized system can’t handle related tasks like analyzing merger documents or earnings calls, requiring separate specialized systems for each type of analysis.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4) Breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation</td> <td>New model releases enable reliable agents that can figure out the right approach dynamically, backtracking and correcting mistakes as needed.</td> <td>New model releases can understand any business document holistically, extracting relevant information regardless of format or type, making specialized systems unnecessary.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>For problems with unclear solution paths, products with more autonomy will achieve better performance. Similarly, when dealing with large, complex input spaces, less specific products will perform better.</p> <p>This is the first in a four-part series examining the role of startups in AI. We’ve observed a historical pattern: AI models that leverage domain knowledge consistently get overtaken by those that leverage compute. Today’s AI products show striking parallels to this pattern.</p> <p>Though I’ve tried to focus on observations rather than opinions in this first part, my view likely shows through. Building software to compensate for current model limitations seems like fighting a losing battle, especially given how rapidly models are advancing. As Jarred, partner at YC, noted in the Lightcone podcast: “that first wave of LLM apps [vertical workflows] mostly did get crushed by the next wave of GPTs.”</p> <p>Sam Altman has repeatedly advocated for building startups that make you excited for releases of better models, rather than scared of them. Many of the founders in the AI application layer I speak to are excited about model releases, but for the sake of their startup, I don’t think they should be. They might be missing the insight from Figure 2; better models might actually reduce your edge, not enhance it. Of course, this is from the point of view of product performance - building something that can solve harder problems more effectively. In the next part, we’ll explore a different dimension: market adoption. After all, having better performance doesn’t guarantee winning the market.</p> <h3 id="appendix-a-statistical-view-of-the-bitter-lesson"><strong>Appendix A: Statistical View of The Bitter Lesson</strong></h3> <p>There’s another way to understand the Bitter Lesson using basic statistics. When building models, you typically face a tradeoff. You can either make a model that’s very precise in how it approaches problems (high bias) or one that’s more flexible but less predictable (high variance). The Bitter Lesson suggests choosing the flexible approach.</p> <p>Why? Because with more compute power and data, you can make flexible models more reliable. It’s like having more practice shots in basketball - eventually, you’ll become consistent even with a less rigid shooting form. The reverse isn’t true - a overly rigid approach will always be limited by its built-in assumptions.</p> <p>This maps directly to our discussion of AI products. Vertical workflows and specific constraints are like adding rigid rules - they make the AI more reliable now but limit how good it can eventually become. In contrast, letting AI operate more freely might seem risky today, but it allows the AI to find better solutions as models improve. As we’ve seen throughout this essay, betting against flexibility has historically been a losing strategy.</p> <h3 id="appendix-b-end-to-end-vs-feature-engineering"><strong>Appendix B: End-to-end vs Feature Engineering</strong></h3> <p><img src="https://lukaspetersson.com/assets/img/e2e.png" alt="e2e"></p> <p><em>Figure 1: Comparison of traditional machine learning, which requires manual feature engineering, with deep learning’s end-to-end approach. The traditional approach needs humans to define what’s important in the data, while deep learning figures this out by itself.</em></p> <p>Traditional machine learning requires humans to decide what’s important in the data. You take raw input, like an image, and manually extract meaningful patterns or “features” - like counting specific shapes or measuring certain properties. Deep learning, in contrast, learns these patterns automatically.</p> <p><img src="https://lukaspetersson.com/assets/img/car-features.png" alt="car-features"></p> <p><em>Figure 2: Self-driving car visualization showing feature extraction in action. The system identifies and tracks specific objects like cars, pedestrians, and lane markings. This represents the traditional approach of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, defined pieces.</em></p> <p>Let’s use self-driving cars as an example. You could build it two ways:</p> <ol> <li>Feature engineering: Break down what the car sees into specific pieces - where are the other cars, where are the lanes, how fast is that pedestrian moving?</li> <li>End-to-end: Feed raw video directly into a neural network and let it figure out how to drive.</li> </ol> <p>The feature engineering approach feels safer and more controlled. That’s why it dominated early AI. But as George Hotz observed: “if anything about the history of AI has taught us anything, it’s that feature engineering approaches will always be replaced and loose to end-to-end.”</p> <p><img src="https://lukaspetersson.com/assets/img/sholto.png" alt="sholto"></p> <p><em>Figure 3: Tweet from Sholto Douglas</em></p> <p>This connects directly to our discussion of AI products. Building vertical-specific tools is like feature engineering - you’re deciding what information matters ahead of time. When you constrain a model’s autonomy, you’re doing the same thing. While this might work better today, history suggests betting on end-to-end approaches will win in the long run.</p> <p>Follow me on <a href="https://x.com/lukaspet" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">X</a> to stay updated.</p> </div> </article></div>]]></description>

<p> <strike>Any and all proceeds will fund graduate students
whose work may impact the discovery, diagnosis or treatment of 
genetic disorders.</strike> </p>

<p>
Any and all proceeds will fund graduate students (and postdocs)
doing work in biology that may 
impact treatment of diseases of cellular metabolism.
</p>

<p>
<b>Update</b>: If you're interested in <a href="http://www.glycobiology.org/news_display.php?id=1546">being that postdoc</a>, get in touch with me!
</p>

<p> It is available at 
<a href="http://www.magcloud.com/browse/Issue/105539">$6.50</a>
thanks to
Hewlett-Packard's high-quality on-demand publishing service, MagCloud.
</p>

<p> It's sixteen pages, saddle-stitch bound and in full color.</p>

<p>
It's a good gift for new students, the recently defended and relatives thereof.
</p>


<p> <b>Why biology?</b>  </p>

<p>If you zoom in on the boundary of human knowledge in the direction of genetics, there's
something just outside humanity's reach:</p>

<p><img src="https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/images/BertrandsLife.png" width="440">
</p>


<p> My wife and I chose to start funding these graduate students after we learned
that <a href="http://overcomingmovementdisorder.blogspot.com//">our
son</a> has a rare, fatal genetic disorder.  </p>



<p>
It may be too late for my son, but it's not too late for other children.
</p>

<p>
Even one child suffering is one child too many.
</p>

<p>
The only way to end this kind of suffering is science.
</p>

<p>
And, the best way to do science is through graduate students.
</p>


<p>
<em><b>Update</b>: When I first wrote this post, my son's specific disorder was unknown.
Thanks to a scientific advance made in genetic diagnostics--specifically exome sequencing--we were able to isolate the mutations in my son's genome and determine that he is the very first documented case of a new disease: N-glycanase deficiency.

<p>

One small dent in the circle of knowledge; one giant leap for my son.

            <h2 id="goodbye-clojure">Goodbye, Clojure</h2>
<p>After ~7 years, I was <em>done</em> with <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>. I was writing a some
<a href="https://github.com/djha-skin/degasolv">CLI</a>
<a href="https://github.com/djha-skin/zic">apps</a>, and I <em>hated</em> how long they took to
start up. The community at large seemed not to care about this problem, except
for the <a href="https://github.com/babashka/babashka">babashka</a> folks. However, I spent
long, hard hours banging my head against
<a href="https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/">native-image</a>
and it just wasn't working out. It was incredibly painful, and at the end of it,
I still didn't have standalone, fast-starting native executables. I decided that
that was a requirement for my main driving hobby language, and that Clojure didn't
have it. It was then that I decided to move on from Clojure.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-hunt-for-a-new-lisp">On the Hunt for a New Lisp</h2>
<p>I started shopping around for a new lisp to use after hours like I'd done before
with my home projects. I had specific requirements in mind, though I didn't
actually list them when I started. I can list them now in hindsight, though:</p>
<ol>
<li>It must be easy to create standalone, fast-starting executables using a
   reasonable toolchain (to address my main concern with Clojure)</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.djhaskin.com/blog/emacs-users-im-okay-i-promise/">I can't use
   Emacs</a>, so
   it's got to be usable in Vim.</li>
<li>It must have good support for Windows and Mac, in addition just Linux/POSIX
   operating systems.</li>
<li>It would be nice if it allows plugging into some other, large-community
   imperative language, like Clojure does with Java.</li>
<li>It must have a reasonably fast runtime -- hopefully as good or better as
   Clojure's.</li>
<li>The language must have a strong multithreading story. It would be grand if
   whatever language it was didn't have a
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock">GIL</a>, for example.</li>
<li>Must have a strong community.</li>
<li>Must have a good ecosystem, with at least the following libraries
   well-implemented, thus supporting my common use cases of making CLI tools:<ol>
<li>JSON parsing and serialization</li>
<li>Sqlite3 support</li>
<li>HTTP requests library </li>
<li>Would be nice if it had functional data structures like Clojure's (this
   ended up being less of an issue later)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I looked at <a href="https://www.scheme.org/">Scheme</a>, but that community seemed to
still be fractured over the
<a href="https://elmord.org/blog/?entry=20171001-r6rs-r7rs">r6rs</a>/<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/scheme-reports-wg2/c/xGd0_eeKmGI/m/q-xM5fbuAQAJ?pli=1">r7rs</a>
mess. Also, there wasn't <a href="https://akkuscm.org/packages/">a big enough ecosystem</a>
to suit my liking.</p>
<p>I'd already tried <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> in school and didn't like it. The runtime was a bit
slow and bloated for my tastes.</p>
<p>I had seen <a href="https://lisp-lang.org/">lisp-lang.org</a> shared on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28725958">the Orange
Site</a>. I was impressed with the
site. I came back to it later after I first saw it and thought, why not. Maybe
I'll give Common Lisp a shot.</p>
<h2 id="magic-happens-here">Magic Happens Here</h2>
<p>I will spare the reader the full narrative of my learning CL.
It was a rough ride learning the language. (I went about it the wrong way,
getting
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Common-LISP-Language-Second-Steele/dp/1555580416/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2W8Y093RT5UQN&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ZDcuOzchQwO4txmVOLrlDRGU3K0TMYMsM0OMVdMocZUW_Wj2K3YYFfB8bATRFvKaR-Vz-P1ai5hpSAzE1q6Ii1FwQK7zu1d8vn3qa88EQCipfnbJoYsHbiNQKbl8NJBhuhZu410r8KXjyJNjG_gvC7r9TX_PSp6VDNLcalMgo4g9xI7m52SnG1BOdFxZ44tmKdn97DKpv0Oqw9ngYg_dDm5_6MUuPan0hPrbrMKcp58.H5QKWhJtzda3Xl9dXb_siYXClmIBIseqGTy3IKAkN-0&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=common+lisp+the+language&amp;qid=1736648071&amp;sprefix=common+lisp+the+language+%2Caps%2C146&amp;sr=8-1">CLtLv2</a>
for Christmas and reading through that. I eventually found the
<a href="https://clhs.lisp.se/">HyperSpec</a> and started reading that as well.)</p>
<p>There were some weird things I didn't expect to find about CL. It's a
<em>standardized</em> language, more like C than Java that way. There are many
compilers, interpreters, and runtimes that implement that standard. There's even
<a href="https://github.com/roswell/roswell">a tool to help install them all and wrangle
them</a>. The most popular one <a href="https://blog.djhaskin.com/blog/common-lisp-community-survey-2024-results/">according to
the
community</a>
is <a href="https://www.sbcl.org/">SBCL</a>.</p>
<p>If I had heard about <a href="https://janet-lang.org/">Janet</a> when starting this hunt,
I might have stopped there and not gone on to CL. Nice syntax, small, fast
executables, <a href="https://janet-lang.org/docs/ffi.html">C FFI</a>, <a href="https://janet.guide/">a fun intro
book</a>. It checks all my boxes.</p>
<p>However, I'm glad I did learn CL first, because I think I'd miss the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Object_System">CLOS</a> and the
Conditions System, things I learned about later in my journey. Common Lisp is
just a bit of a stronger language.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-met">Requirements Met</h2>
<p>I found answers to all my questions, and decided my next lisp was going to be
Common Lisp. I've been coding in it ever since. Here are the things I found:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Standalone Executables</strong>: there are lots of ways to do this in Common Lisp. I
   summarize my favorite way in <a href="https://blog.djhaskin.com/blog/release-common-lisp-on-your-first-day/">another blog
   post</a>.
   Start up times range from a fraction of a second to nearly instant, depending
   on if you compile the executable with compression or not. This is not a
   bolt-on feature; it's a first-class-citizen way to distribute Lisp programs.</li>
<li><strong>Vim Workflow</strong>: There are a lot of good ones here, but I eventually settled
   into <a href="https://blog.djhaskin.com/blog/developing-common-lisp-using-vim-with-tmux-or-conemu/">a Vim workflow of my
   own</a>.
   Readers may also be interested to know that <a href="https://blog.djhaskin.com/blog/experience-report-using-vs-code-alive-to-write-common-lisp/">I found VS Code perfectly
   usable</a>
   as a Common Lisp IDE.</li>
<li><strong>Windows/Mac/Linux Support</strong>: SBCL, a popular implementation and compiler for
   Common Lisp, supports The Big Three relatively well, as outlined in the
   blog post linked in point #1.</li>
<li><strong>Larger Imperative Ecosystem</strong>: Most implementations actually hook into the C
   programming language pretty well through the
   <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cffi">CFFI</a>. That works for me.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime Speed</strong>: SBCL is <a href="https://github.com/niklas-heer/speed-comparison">crazy
   fast</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Multithreading</strong>: While the Common Lisp standard does not make provisions
   for multithreading, all major implementations do support it and their
   differences are papered over with a library called
   <a href="https://sionescu.github.io/bordeaux-threads/">Bordeaux-Threads</a>. This

<p>I wrote this blog post because I noticed that there have been more newcomers on
the <a href="https://discord.gg/HsxkkvQ">Common Lisp Discord</a> and they've been asking the same questions I was
when I was first looking at the language. I wanted to lay down a bit of history
around why I came to Common Lisp, and how I acclimated to the language. I hope
it may be helpful to those new to or curious about Common Lisp.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>For the last ten years I’ve worked for American tech companies as an Australian based in Australia. First I worked in a satellite office for Zendesk. My direct manager was Australian, but many other managers and teams (and of course the top executives) were America-based. Now at GitHub I work fully-remote on a mixed team for an American manager based in America.</p>
<h3>Timezones</h3>
<p>The biggest difference in working for an American company is the timezones. I have three or four hours overlap with folks working on the west coast, and maybe one hour overlap with the east coast. Fortunately my American managers have been based on the west coast. I think it’d be hard to manage otherwise. At Zendesk, timezone overlap only mattered when working with American teams, but at GitHub half my team (including my manager) is in America.</p>
<p>When I sit down to work in the morning, the first thing I do is to catch up to half a day of work that’s happened while I was asleep. That means spending around thirty minutes reading emails, notifications, and so on. Slack “remind me later” is a lifesaver - I don’t reply to anything right away unless it’s critical, but I do tag messages that need a reply so they ping me in half an hour once I’m done catching up. The morning is usually quite busy, because I have to fit in any calls or synchronous chats in that time. If I don’t have calls, I try to work as quickly as possible so I can resolve any blockers before everyone else signs off for the day.</p>
<p>Afternoons are almost always clear. This is one of the biggest benefits to working cross-timezones: I have a few hours of deep work available every day where I can be confident my manager isn’t going to pull everyone in for a meeting. It can also be pretty lonely. For the first nine months at GitHub I was the only APAC-timezone based engineer, so every afternoon was just me<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I give a lot of credit to GitHub for having excellent “writing things down” culture. At a lot of companies it would be really hard to keep up with what was going on when you’re not in the right timezone. But I rarely felt like decisions were being made in meetings I couldn’t attend.</p>
<p>One other big benefit to being in a different timezone is the ability to hand off work so that it never really stops. Because of the hand-off cost, we only do this for some types of work (e.g. important bugs or really critical features), but when we do it feels like a superpower. The team can literally move 2x as fast. It’s also great for customers when they report an issue and it’s fixed by the next morning - an all-American team would have to work late to get that done, but for a split-timezone team it’s just par for the course.</p>
<h3>Instability</h3>
<p>Working for an American company as a non-American feels more unstable. There’s always the possibility that the American company might decide to terminate the Australian experiment and shutter the entire team. I’ve seen this happen multiple times to other satellite offices or teams outside of the USA. You can try to be as valuable as possible, but ultimately there’s nothing you can do if the C-staff suddenly decide that working across timezones isn’t worth the hassle.</p>
<p>Australia does have a healthy tech sector, but it’s nothing compared to America’s. If I lived in San Francisco, I’d have ~100x more available jobs to apply to if I lost my current one. </p>
<p>For this reason, I operate a little less idealistically and a little more tactically than I would in an Australian-based company. American engineers seem happier to be disagreeable or to push back hard against company strategy. I put a lot of thought into <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-to-ship">how to align</a> with company strategy (and when I push back, how to make sure that’s in service of the company’s current goals.)</p>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>Australians and Americans are culturally similar, but not identical<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. Australians typically play down their achievements, while Americans like to talk themselves up. Americans naturally read to Australians as boastful, while Australians naturally read to Americans as meek (or not very competent). American office culture is more enthusiastic and tonally positive than Australian office culture. Americans tend to be enthusiastic about their company mission - in the extreme, believing that they’re saving the world - while Australians are more liable to think “it’s just a job, mate”.</p>
<p>In my experience, there’s not much meeting-in-the-middle here: if you work for an American company, you’ve got to talk like an American. It’s an adjustment. I can’t speak for how it’d be to make this adjustment if you were from a less similar culture, but I bet it’d be tough.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Why do it? Why wouldn’t I work for Australian tech companies? In general, American companies tend to operate at a bigger scale, offer better comp (Australian companies don’t typically offer RSUs) and have better brand recognition. So when I’m looking to work at scale at a company I’ve heard of, American companies are more competitive.</p>
<p>I’ve also grown to love the rhythm of busy mornings and deep-work afternoons. And of course working fully remote is great. I think it’s a pretty good deal for the company too - follow-the-sun work and on-call is a big benefit - so I hope I get to keep doing it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/about-us/events-conferences/health-care-conference">J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference</a>, starting Monday in San Francisco, 8,000 insurance providers, pharma investors, and execs from Open AI, Amazon, and Meta will announce mergers, discuss advances in AI diagnostics and gene therapies, and puzzle over&nbsp;FDA scrutiny and compliance issues. But many of the sessions and “what’s next” debates will follow the Chatham House Rule — a gag order that prevents attendees from attributing information to speakers or sharing names or affiliations of other guests.</p><p>“The rule makes it terrible for networking,” said Malcolm Ocean, a Bay Area “<a href="https://malcolmocean.com/">renegade anthropologist</a>” who will not attend the conference. “In principle, it prohibits you from saying to your team, hey, I talked to this guy, and he’s working on this startup.”</p><p>But the Chatham House Rule (it’s singular but is often misused in the plural) has caught fire in the business world, especially within the secrecy-obsessed tech industry, and now become ubiquitous at events across the Bay Area. At an <a href="https://app.glueup.com/en/event/responsible-adoption-of-general-purpose-ai-108941/">AI summit</a> in Redwood City, an intimate dinner party in Los Altos Hills, <a href="https://lu.ma/brexupfront">Brex Supper Club salons</a>, Facebook’s <a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2019/what-worked-and-what-didnt-from-facebooks-local-news-summit/">local news summit</a>, Scale AI’s<a href="https://www.scale.com/legal/ai-leadership-summit"> leadership summit</a>, and the <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/AM13/WEF_AM13_CodeofConduct.pdf">World Economic Forum at Davos</a>, the rules of the house are increasingly Chatham.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also become prevalent, somewhat contentiously, on college campuses and has even crept into pop culture, via Netflix’s “The Diplomat,” a political thriller that dropped a reference to the Chatham House Rule in its heavily watched first season. Google Trends backs this up, indicating a 1,550% spike in searches for “Chatham house rules” as of Jan 7.</p><p>“I find that basically my whole life is Chatham House rules,” <a href="https://x.com/lessin/status/1844156064805392617">Sam Lessin</a>, a general partner at Slow Ventures, tweeted in November.&nbsp;</p><p>For the uninitiated, the Chatham House Rule dates to 1927, when the Royal Institute of International Affairs, a policy institute located at Chatham House in London, introduced the policy to foster free speech among analysts. It gained traction in the turbulent pre- and postwar period among academics, who appreciated the candor it allowed them.</p><p>Ocean’s first brush with the rule came in 2018, at a weekend “ideas” conference. His welcome email contained a throwaway line about the rule, in addition to the wifi password and information on where to check in, “so you can reasonably assume that most people didn’t read it.” That’s a problem, he said: If there isn’t common knowledge about the existence of the Chatham House Rule, “it diminishes the effect of confidentiality.”</p><p>He has since become frustrated by the term’s overuse, noting that it has popped up even at dinner parties and small coffee meetups. “There’s no clear reason why we’re using it,” he said. “I haven’t noticed people saying spicier stuff.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.askalinguist.org/">Jenny Lederer</a>, a linguistics professor at San Francisco State University, argued that the Chatham House Rule has intrinsic flaws. “The rule dissociates ideas and opinions from the speaker, allowing them to express something controversial without taking personal ownership,” she explained. But that’s a fallacy, because “when humans process language, they always pay attention to who the speaker is.”</p><p>Jeremy Nixon, the 31-year-old founder of <a href="https://agihouse.ai/">AGI House</a>, an AI-themed co-living house in San Francisco, believes there’s value to the rule if it’s properly implemented. He has run events that delve into taboo topics — the experience of living with bipolar disorder or psychosis, for example —&nbsp; and said people wouldn’t have shared without the gag rule being in place. “That was not a conversation that could leave the room because of the reputational consequences to the person revealing it,” he said. “If you can have a conversation that’s impossible anywhere else, it feels really freeing and special.”</p><p>But Nixon no longer applies the rule at his events. “It became treated just as something you should do,” he said. “It doesn’t work nearly as well if not taken seriously.” Instead, his groups have moved to signing NDAs or explicitly stating that conversations are not to be shared externally.</p><p>But the rule continues to proliferate in the Bay Area. In December, the Foresight Institute, a nonprofit that has received support from the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fund for Strategic Innovation and investor Mitch Kapor, hosted a $1,000-a-head Vision Weekend. It kicked off with a VIP bash at <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/10/23/salesforce-tower-secret-institute/">The Institute</a>, a secret club atop Salesforce Tower, then continued on to the Internet Archive, where 250 techies and researchers dived into panels on AI, machine consciousness, and “longevity cities.” The Chatham House Rule was in effect for the majority of events.&nbsp;</p><p>“The rule lends a sense of authority, credibility, and institutional sanction,” said SFSU’s Lederer. “The motivation is liberating ideas but removing accountability for those ideas is a shield for expressing controversial or unsavory ideas.”</p><p>But what one person sees as unsavory another calls long-overdue freedom of speech. A <a href="https://www.thefire.org/news/fire-survey-only-20-university-faculty-say-conservative-would-fit-well-their-department">December survey</a> found that 87% of U.S. college faculty struggled with hot-button topics; hence, the <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/us-universities-mull-adoption-chatham-house-rule-classes">spread of the Chatham House Rule on campuses</a>. Last year, Stanford University floated the rule as a policy to protect students from harassment, with <a href="https://freespeech.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/privacy/chatham-house-rule">violators facing penalties</a> like lower grades.</p><p>This can be dangerous, said Lederer, as removing identity from speech “can potentially remove our own sense of morality.”</p><p>But as we enter a new political era, and political and cultural divisions deepen, the rule’s popularity shows no signs of fading. “In corporate culture, there’s a liberating and freeing quality to the idea that this is a safe space for me to say unpopular things and not get labeled as a conservative or racist,” Lederer said.&nbsp;</p><p>Or, as Ocean put it, “maybe it’s just a bad solution to a worse problem.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h3>Press Release</h3>


<p>10 January 2025</p>




<p>On December 24th, AES Andes, a subsidiary of the US power company AES Corporation, submitted a project for a massive industrial complex for environmental impact assessment. This complex threatens the pristine skies above ESO’s Paranal Observatory in Chile’s Atacama Desert, the darkest and clearest of any astronomical observatory in the world <a href="#1">[1]</a>. The industrial megaproject is planned to be located just 5 to 11 kilometres from telescopes at Paranal, which would cause irreparable damage to astronomical observations, in particular due to light pollution emitted throughout the project’s operational life. Relocating the complex would save one of Earth's last truly pristine dark skies.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">An irreplaceable heritage for humanity&nbsp;</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Since its inauguration in 1999, Paranal Observatory, built and operated by the European Southern Observatory (ESO), has led to significant astronomy breakthroughs, such as the first image of an exoplanet and confirming the accelerated expansion of the Universe. The Nobel Prize in Physics in 2020 was awarded for research on the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, in which Paranal telescopes were instrumental. The observatory is a key asset for astronomers worldwide, including those in Chile, which has seen its astronomical community grow substantially in the last decades. Additionally, the nearby Cerro Armazones hosts the construction of ESO’s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), the world’s biggest telescope of its kind — a revolutionary facility that will dramatically change what we know about our Universe.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“The proximity of the AES Andes industrial megaproject to Paranal poses a critical risk to the most pristine night skies on the planet,”</em> highlighted ESO Director General, Xavier Barcons. <em>“Dust emissions during construction, increased atmospheric turbulence, and especially light pollution will irreparably impact the capabilities for astronomical observation, which have thus far attracted multi-billion-Euro investments by the governments of the ESO Member States.”</em></p>
<h4 dir="ltr">The unprecedented impact of a megaproject&nbsp;</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The project encompasses an industrial complex of more than 3000 hectares, which is close to the size of a city, or district, such as Valparaiso, Chile or Garching near Munich, Germany. It includes constructing a port, ammonia and hydrogen production plants and thousands of electricity generation units near Paranal.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thanks to its atmospheric stability and lack of light pollution, the Atacama Desert is a unique natural laboratory for astronomical research. These attributes are essential for scientific projects that aim to address fundamental questions, such as the origin and evolution of the Universe or the quest for life and the habitability of other planets.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">A call to protect the Chilean skies&nbsp;</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“Chile, and in particular Paranal, is a truly special place for astronomy —&nbsp;its dark skies are a natural heritage that transcends its borders and benefits all humanity,”</em> said Itziar de Gregorio, ESO’s Representative in Chile.<em> “It is crucial to consider alternative locations for this megaproject that do not endanger one of the world's most important astronomical treasures.”</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">The relocation of this project remains the only effective way to prevent irreversible damage to Paranal's unique skies. This measure will not only safeguard the future of astronomy but also preserve one of the last truly pristine dark skies on Earth.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3><p dir="ltr"><a name="1"></a>[1] A <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/519/1/26/6936422">study</a> by Falchi and collaborators, published in 2023 in <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>, compared light pollution at all 28 major astronomical observatories, finding Paranal to be the darkest site among them.</p>
