<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-episode="34">
    <article>
      <span></span>
      
      <p>Sometimes, improving your application CSS just takes a one-line upgrade or enhancement! Learn about 12 properties to start incorporating into your projects, and enjoy reducing technical debt, removing JavaScript, and scoring easy wins for user experience.</p>
<p>Properties are explored for the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="#stable-upgrades">Stable Upgrades</a></strong>: fix a hack or issue by replacing older techniques</li>
<li><strong><a href="#stable-enhancements">Stable Enhancements</a></strong>: provide an improved experience with well-supported modern properties</li>
<li><strong><a href="#progressive-enhancements">Progressive Enhancements</a></strong>: provide an upgraded experience when these properties are supported without causing harm in unsupporting browsers</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h2 id="stable-upgrades"><strong>Stable Upgrades</strong></h2>
</div>
<p>The following well-supported properties can help fix a hack or long-standing issue by replacing older techniques.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="aspect-ratio">aspect-ratio</h3>
</div>
<p>Have you ever used the “<a href="https://css-tricks.com/aspect-ratio-boxes/">padding hack</a>” to force an aspect ratio such as 16:9 for video embeds? As of September 2021, the <code>aspect-ratio</code> property is stable in evergreen browsers and is the only property needed to define an aspect ratio.</p>
<p>For an HD video, you can just use <code>aspect-ratio: 16/9</code>. For a perfect square, only <code>aspect-ratio: 1</code> is required since the implied second value is also <code>1 </code>.</p>
<details open="">
  <summary>CSS for "Basic use of aspect-ratio"</summary>
<pre><code><span>.aspect-ratio-hd</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>aspect-ratio</span><span>:</span> 16/9<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>.aspect-ratio-square</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>aspect-ratio</span><span>:</span> 1<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</details>


<p>Of note, an applied <code>aspect-ratio</code> is forgiving and will allow content to take precedence. This means that when content would cause the element to exceed the ratio in at least one dimension, the element will still grow or change shape to accommodate the content. To prevent or control this behavior, you can add additional dimension properties, like <code>max-width</code>, which may be necessary to avoid expanding out of a flex or grid container.</p>
<details open="">
  <summary>CSS for "Forgiving aspect-ratio"</summary>
<pre><code><span>/* Applied to the flexbox children which have a size constraint from their parent */</span>
<span>.aspect-ratio-square</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>aspect-ratio</span><span>:</span> 1<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</details>

<div>
  <p>
    Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Iste molestias maiores velit quaerat debitis incidunt delectus nulla, quibusdam fugit eos? Fugiat asperiores assumenda nulla corrupti, sit repellendus ducimus necessitatibus voluptates.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Iste molestias maiores velit quaerat debitis incidunt delectus nulla, quibusdam fugit eos?
  </p>
</div>
<p>If you are hesitant to fully replace the padding hack and still want to provide some dimension guardrails, review the <a href="https://smolcss.dev/#smol-aspect-ratio-gallery">Smol Aspect Ratio Gallery</a> for a progressively enhanced solution to <code>aspect-ratio</code>.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="object-fit">object-fit</h3>
</div>
<p>This is actually the oldest property in this list, but it solves an important issue and definitely fits the sentiment of a one-line upgrade.</p>
<p>The use of <code>object-fit</code> causes an <code>img</code> or other <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element">replaced element</a> to act as the container for its contents and have the those contents adopt resizing behavior similar to <code>background-size</code>.</p>
<p>While there are a few values available for <code>object-fit</code>, the following are the ones you’re most likely to use:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cover</code> - the image resizes to <em>cover</em> the element, and maintains its aspect-ratio so that the content is not distorted</li>
<li><code>scale-down</code> - the image resizes (if needed) <em>within</em> the element so that it is fully visible without being clipped and maintains its aspect-ratio, which may lead to extra space (”letterboxing”) around the image if the element has a different rendered aspect-ratio</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, <code>object-fit</code> is an excellent property pairing with <code>aspect-ratio</code> to ensure images are not distorted when you apply a custom aspect ratio.</p>
<details open="">
  <summary>CSS for "Use of object-fit with aspect-ratio"</summary>
<pre><code><span>.image</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>object-fit</span><span>:</span> cover<span>;</span>
  <span>aspect-ratio</span><span>:</span> 1<span>;</span>

  <span>/* Optional: constrain image size */</span>
  <span>max-block-size</span><span>:</span> 250px<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</details>

<p>One of many logical properties, <code>margin-inline</code> functions as a shorthand for setting the inline (left and right in horizontal writing modes) margin.</p>
<p>The replacement here is simple:</p>
<pre><code><span>/* Before */</span>
<span>margin-left</span><span>:</span> auto<span>;</span>
<span>margin-right</span><span>:</span> auto<span>;</span>

<span>/* After */</span>
<span>margin-inline</span><span>:</span> auto<span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Logical properties have been available for a couple of years and now have <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-logical-props">support upwards of 98%</a> (with occasional prefixing). Review this article from Ahmad Shadeed to learn more about <a href="https://ishadeed.com/article/css-logical-properties/">using logical properties</a> and their importance for sites with international audiences.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="stable-enhancements"><strong>Stable Enhancements</strong></h2>
</div>
<p>These well-supported modern CSS properties can provide an improved experience, and may also allow replacing older methods or even JavaScript-aided solutions. Fallback solutions are not likely to be needed, although this is dependent on your specific application considerations, and testing is always encouraged.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="text-underline-offset">text-underline-offset</h3>
</div>
<p>The use of <code>text-underline-offset</code> allows you to control the distance between the text baseline and the underline. This property has become a part of my standard reset, applied as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>a:not([class])</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>text-underline-offset</span><span>:</span> 0.25em<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>You can use this offset to clear descenders as well as (subjectively) improve legibility, particularly when links are grouped in close proximity, such as a bulleted list of links.</p>
<p>This upgrade may replace older hacks like a border or pseudo-element, or even a gradient background, especially when used with its friends:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-color">text-decoration-color</a> to change the underline color</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-thickness">text-decoration-thickness</a> to change the underline stroke thickness.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3 id="outline-offset">outline-offset</h3>
</div>
<p>Have you been using <code>box-shadow</code> or perhaps a pseudo-element to supply a custom outline when you wanted distance between the element and outline on focus?</p>
<p>Good news! The long-available <code>outline-offset</code> property (<a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=outline-offset">as early as 2006</a>!) may be one you missed, and it enables pushing the outline away from the element with a positive value or pulling it into the element with a negative value.</p>
<p>In the demo, the gray solid line is the element border, and the blue dashed line is the outline being positioned via <code>outline-offset</code>.</p>
<details open="">
  <summary>CSS for "Positive and negative outline-offset"</summary>
<pre><code><span>.outline-offset</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>outline</span><span>:</span> 2px dashed blue<span>;</span>
  <span>outline-offset</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span>--outline-offset<span>,</span> .5em<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</details>

<div>
<p><span>Positive offset</span>
  <span>Negative offset</span>
</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Reminder</strong>: outlines are <em>not</em> computed as part of the element’s box size, so increasing the distance will not increase the amount of space an element occupies. This is similar to how <code>box-shadow</code> is rendered without impacting the element size as well.</p>

</blockquote>
<div>
<h3 id="scroll-margin-topbottom">scroll-margin-top/bottom</h3>
</div>
<p>The <code>scroll-margin</code> set of properties (and corresponding <code>scroll-padding</code>) allows adding an offset to an element in the context of the scroll position. In other words, adding <code>scroll-padding-top</code> can increase scroll offset above the element but doesn’t affect its layout position within the document.</p>
<p>Why is this useful? Well, it can alleviate issues caused by a sticky nav element covering content when an anchor link is activated. Using <code>scroll-margin-top</code> we can increase the space above the element when it is scrolled to via navigation to account for the space occupied by the sticky nav.</p>
<p>I like to include a generic starting rule in my reset for any element with an <code>[id]</code> attribute given it has the potential to become an anchor link.</p>
<pre><code><span>[id]</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>scroll-margin-top</span><span>:</span> 2rem<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>An alternative selector is explored in the Modern CSS article on <a href="https://moderncss.dev/modern-css-for-dynamic-component-based-architecture/#css-reset-additions">component-based architecture</a> and is also in use on this site, as can be tested by using the links from the article table of contents sidebar.</p>
<p>For a more robust solution when accounting for the overlap of sticky, fixed, or absolute positioned elements, you may want to use a custom property with a fallback value. Then, with the assistance of JavaScript, measure the real distance needed and <a href="https://12daysofweb.dev/2021/css-custom-properties/#accessing-and-setting-custom-properties-with-javascript">update the custom property value</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span>[id]</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>/* Update --scroll-margin with JS if needed */</span>
	<span>scroll-margin-top</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span>--scroll-margin<span>,</span> 2rem<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>I encourage you to also update this solution further and use the logical property equivalents: <code>scroll-padding-block-start</code> and <code>-block-end</code>.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="color-scheme">color-scheme</h3>
</div>
<p>You may be familiar with the <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> media query to customize dark and light themes. The CSS property <code>color-scheme</code> is an opt-in to adapting browser UI elements including form controls, scrollbars, and CSS system colors. The adaptation asks the browser to render those items with either a <code>light</code> or <code>dark</code> scheme, and the property allows defining a preference order.</p>
<p>If you’re enabling adapting your entire application, set the following on the <code>:root</code>, which says to preference a <code>dark</code> theme (or flip the order to preference a <code>light</code> theme).</p>
<pre><code><span>:root</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>color-scheme</span><span>:</span> dark light<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>You can also define <code>color-scheme</code> on individual elements, such as adjusting form controls within an element with a dark background for improved contrast.</p>
<pre><code><span>.dark-background</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>color-scheme</span><span>:</span> dark<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Learn from Sara Joy’s presentation about how to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lye56NHGtLA">use color-scheme for easy dark mode</a>, and more about incorporating this feature.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="accent-color">accent-color</h3>
</div>
<p>If you’ve ever wanted to change the color of checkboxes or radio buttons, you’ve been seeking <code>accent-color</code>. With this property, you can modify the <code>:checked</code> appearance of radio buttons and checkboxes and the filled-in state for both the progress element and range input. The browser’s default focus “halo” may also be adjusted if you do not have another override.</p>
<details open="">
  <summary>CSS for "Effect of using accent-color"</summary>
<pre><code><span>:root</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>accent-color</span><span>:</span> mediumvioletred<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</details>

<div>
<p><label>

  </label>
  <label>
    Progress<br>
    <progress max="100" value="70">70%</progress>
  </label>
</p>
</div>
<p>Consider adding both <code>accent-color</code> and <code>color-scheme</code> to your baseline application styles for a quick win toward custom theme management.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you need more comprehensive custom styling for form controls, review the Modern CSS series beginning with <a href="https://moderncss.dev/pure-css-custom-styled-radio-buttons/">radio buttons</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<div>
<h3 id="width-fit-content">width: fit-content</h3>
</div>
<p>One of my favorite CSS hidden gems is the use of <code>fit-content</code> to “shrink wrap” an element to its contents.</p>
<p>Whereas you may have used an inline display value such as <code>display: inline-block</code> to reduce an element’s width to the content size, an upgrade to <code>width: fit-content</code> will achieve the same effect. The advantage of <code>width: fit-content</code> is that it leaves the <code>display</code> value available, thereby not changing the position of the element in the layout unless you adjust that as well. The computed box size will adjust to the dimensions created by <code>fit-content</code>.</p>
<details open="">
  <summary>CSS for "Basic usage of fit-content"</summary>
<pre><code><span>.fit-content</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>width</span><span>:</span> fit-content<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</details>

<div>
<p>Using fit-content</p>
<p>Without the use of fit-content</p>
</div>
<p>The <code>fit-content</code> value is one of several <a href="https://moderncss.dev/contextual-spacing-for-intrinsic-web-design/">keywords that enable intrinsic sizing</a>.</p>
<p>Consider the secondary upgrade for this technique to the logical property equivalent of <code>inline-size: fit-content</code>.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="progressive-enhancements"><strong>Progressive Enhancements</strong></h2>
</div>
<p>This last set of properties provides an upgraded experience when they are supported and can be used without fear of causing harm in unsupporting browsers. This means they do not need a fallback method even though they are more recent additions to modern CSS.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="overscroll-behavior">overscroll-behavior</h3>
</div>
<p>The default behavior of contained scroll regions - areas with limited dimensions where overflow is allowed to be scrolled - is that when the scroll runs out in the element, the scroll interaction passes to the background page. This can be jarring at best, and frustrating at worst for your users.</p>
<p>Use of <code>overscroll-behavior: contain</code> will isolate the scrolling to the contained region, preventing continuing the scroll by moving it to the parent page once the scroll boundary is reached. This is useful in contexts such as a sidebar of navigation links, which may have an independent scroll from the main page content, which may be a long article or documentation page.</p>
<details open="">
  <summary>CSS for "Basic usage of overscroll-behavior"</summary>
<pre><code><span>.sidebar, .article</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>overscroll-behavior</span><span>:</span> contain<span>;</span>

<div>
<h3 id="text-wrap">text-wrap</h3>
</div>
<p>One of the newest properties (as of 2023) is <code>text-wrap</code>, which has two values that solve the type-setting problem of unbalanced lines. This includes preventing “orphans,” which describes a lonely word sitting by itself in the last text line.</p>
<p>The first available value is <code>balance</code>, which has a goal of evening out the number of characters per line of text.</p>
<p>There is a limitation of six lines of wrapped text, so the technique is best used on headlines or other shorter text passages. Limiting the scope of application also helps limit the impact on page rendering speed.</p>
<details open="">
  <summary>CSS for "Applying text-wrap: balance"</summary>
<pre><code><span>:is(h1, h2, h3, h4, .text-balance)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>text-wrap</span><span>:</span> balance<span>;</span>

  <span>/* For demonstration */</span>
  <span>max-inline-size</span><span>:</span> 25ch<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</details>

<div>
<p>This text has been balanced by text-wrap</p>
<p>This text has not been balanced by text-wrap</p>
</div>
<p>The other value of <code>pretty</code> specifically addresses preventing orphans and can be more broadly applied. The algorithm behind <code>pretty</code> will evaluate the last four lines in a text block to work out adjustments as needed to ensure the last line has two or more words.</p>
<details open="">
  <summary>CSS for "Applying text-wrap: balance"</summary>
<pre><code><span>p</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>text-wrap</span><span>:</span> pretty<span>;</span>

  <span>/* For demonstration */</span>
  <span>max-inline-size</span><span>:</span> 35ch<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</details>

<div>
<p><strong>With text-wrap: pretty</strong></p>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Dolore cupiditate aliquid, facere explicabo voluptatibus iure! Saepe nostrum quasi corporis totam accusamus beatae obcaecati rerum fugiat minima perferendis voluptatibus.</p>
<p><strong>Without</strong></p>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Dolore cupiditate aliquid, facere explicabo voluptatibus iure! Saepe nostrum quasi corporis totam accusamus beatae obcaecati rerum fugiat minima perferendis voluptatibus.</p>
</div>
<p>Use of <code>text-wrap</code> is a great progressive enhancement. However, any adjustments do not change an element's computed width, so a side-effect in some layouts may be an increase in unwanted space next to the text.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="scrollbar-gutter">scrollbar-gutter</h3>
</div>
<p>In some scenarios, the appearance or disappearance of scrollbars can cause an unwanted layout shift. For example, when a dialog overlay is displayed and the background page adds <code>overflow: hidden</code> to prevent scrolling, causing a shift from removing the no longer needed scrollbars.</p>
<p>The modern CSS property <code>scrollbar-gutter</code> enables a reservation of space for scrollbars in the layout, which prevents that undesirable shift. When there’s no need for a scrollbar, the browser will still paint a gutter as extra space created in addition to any padding on the scroll container.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: This property only has an effect when the user’s system settings are <em>not</em> for “overlay” scrollbars, as in the default for Mac OS, where the scrollbar only appears as an overlay on content that is actively being scrolled. Do not drop padding in favor of <code>scrollbar-gutter</code> since you will lose all intended space when overlay scrollbars are in use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since this is visually apparent extra space, you may choose to assign this property using two keywords: <code>scrollbar-gutter: stable both-edges</code>. The use of <code>stable</code> by itself only adds a gutter where the scrollbar would otherwise be, while the addition of <code>both-edges</code> preferences adding the space to the opposite side of the scroll container, too. This ensures visual balance when the layout doesn’t yet need scrollbars to be visible. See <a href="https://defensivecss.dev/tip/scrollbar-gutter/">a visual of using scrollbar-gutter</a> from Ahmad Shadeed.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Ubuntu-Low-Lat-Generic-Kernel">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Ubuntu-Low-Lat-Generic-Kernel</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39173229">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="UBUNTU" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/ubuntu.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
Ubuntu has long provided a "low-latency" kernel build intended for industrial embedded systems and other latency sensitive environments. Ahead of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, Canonical is looking at applying those low-latency optimizations to their generic kernel build.
</p><p>
Ubuntu 24.04 LTS keeps getting more interesting from the performance department... From being aggressive in <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Ubuntu-24.04-Will-Use-Linux-6.8">targeting the Linux 6.8 kernel</a>, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Ubuntu-Frame-Pointers-Default">frame pointers by default</a>, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/ubuntu-x86-64-v3-benchmark">experimenting with Ubuntu x86-64-v3 builds</a>, and more, this next long-term support release of Ubuntu Linux is looking quite interesting. The latest is now considering applying their low-latency changes to the generic kernel build used by Ubuntu.
</p><p>
Ubuntu's low-latency kernel is mostly Kconfig configuration changes applied to their kernel build that they are now at least considering to make by default. <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/2051342">This Launchpad bug report elaborates</a>:
</p><blockquote>Ubuntu provides the "lowlatency" kernel: a kernel optimized for applications that have special "low latency" requirements.
<p>
Currently, this kernel does not include any specific UBUNTU SAUCE patches to improve the extra "low latency" requirements, but the only difference is a small subset of .config options.
</p><p>
Almost all these options are now configurable either at boot-time or even at run-time, with the only exception of CONFIG_HZ (250 in the generic kernel vs 1000 in the lowlatency kernel).
</p><p>
Maintaining a separate kernel for a single config option seems a bit overkill and it is a significant cost of engineering hours, build time, regression testing time and resources. Not to mention the risk of the low-latency kernel falling behind and not being perfectly in sync with the latest generic kernel.
</p><p>
Enabling the low-latency settings in the generic kernel has been evaluated before, but it has been never finalized due to the potential risk of performance regressions in CPU-intensive applications (increasing HZ from 250 to 1000 may introduce more kernel jitter in number crunching workloads). The outcome of the original proposal resulted in a re-classification of the lowlatency kernel as a desktop-oriented kernel, enabling additional low latency features (LP: #2023007).</p></blockquote>
<p>Among the changes in the low-latency kernel are enabling CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL for full tickless mode, CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU for moving RCU callbacks to the KThread context, CONFIG_RCU_LAZY for batch RCU callbacks, and CONFIG_HZ=1000 for 1000Hz to improve system responsiveness.
</p><p>
The worry is primarily over risking HPC / server workload performance. But, hey, I invite that as an opportunity now to run some fresh Phoronix benchmarks of the Ubuntu kernel offerings in the coming days...
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=epyc-8324p-siena&amp;image=amd_epyc8324_3_med" alt="AMD EPYC server CPUs"></p>
<p>The matter of applying the low-latency settings to Ubuntu's generic kernel build are still to be determined and those wanting to find the latest can do so via <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/2051342">this Launchpad bug</a>. It will be interesting to see what they decide and what other performance changes they may pursue for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                                            <div><p>For the 89 passengers and crew aboard USAir flight 1493, it had been an unremarkable flight from takeoff in Columbus, Ohio, to touchdown at Los Angeles International Airport. That evening, the first of February 1991, the weather was perfectly clear, the Boeing 737 had a clean sheet with no mechanical faults, and with the runway in sight from 25 miles out, the approach was uneventful. Flying the plane from the right seat, First Officer David Kelly pulled the nose up to ease the touchdown and greased it onto runway 24 Left. He then brought the nose back down, smooth and steady. And then, without time to even shout, all hell broke loose.</p><p>&nbsp;Kelly would later recall seeing the brief flash of a propeller before he instinctively pushed the brake pedal to the floor, but it was much too late. With a powerful jolt and a metallic screech, the 737 plowed into a small commuter plane, crushing the hapless turboprop beneath and propelling it forward down the runway at over 90 miles an hour. In the cabin of the 737, the lights went out and fire billowed past the windows. Locked together, the two planes veered left, crossed a grass strip and a taxiway, and collided at freeway speed with an abandoned airport fire station.</p><p>The impact instantly killed all 12 people aboard the commuter plane, as well as the USAir captain, Colin Shaw, but the ordeal for the survivors was far from over. The small plane’s fuel tanks burst during the crash. A pool of fuel ignited underneath the USAir 737, sending plumes of smoke into the cabin. Passengers fought their way to the exits amid choking fumes, braving long drops and roaring flames in their frantic rush to escape. Not everyone made it: firefighters would later discover the bodies of 19 passengers and a flight attendant lying in the aisle, where they collapsed. Two more badly burned passengers would later die in hospital, bringing the final death toll to 35.</p><p>But that was yet to come. In fact, in the first few minutes after the accident, airport officials didn’t even know that two planes were involved. Air traffic controllers told fire crews that a Boeing 737 crashed, but as firefighters worked the scene, they reported discovering a propeller in the wreckage. The Boeing 737 is a jet; it doesn’t have any propellers. Clearly another airplane was involved, but which one — and why was it there?</p><p>***</p></div>
                                            <div><p>At the LAX control tower, local controller Robin Lee Wascher was taken off duty — as is standard practice after a crash. After hearing about the propeller, she knew she must have cleared USAir flight 1493 to land on an occupied runway. As tower supervisors searched for any sign of a missing commuter flight, Wascher left the room. Replaying the events in her mind, she realized that the missing plane was SkyWest flight 5569, a 19-seat Fairchild Metroliner twin turboprop bound for Palmdale. Several minutes before clearing the USAir jet to land, she had told flight 5569 to “taxi into position and hold” on runway 24L. But she could not recall having cleared it for takeoff. The plane was probably still sitting “in position” on the runway waiting for her instructions when the USAir 737 plowed into it from behind. It was a devastating realization, but an important one, so in an act of great bravery, she returned to the tower, pointed to flight 5569, and told her supervisor, “This is what I believe USAir hit.”</p><p><strong>***</strong></p><p>According to the timeline later reconstructed by the National Transportation Safety Board, the pilot of SkyWest 5569 asked for permission to take off from a location partway down the runway called Intersection 45. Wascher cleared the flight to enter the runway at this location, but she didn’t give takeoff clearance because another Metroliner from a rival commuter airline already had permission to cross the runway ahead of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Several events then occurred in quick succession. First, the second Metroliner tuned in to the wrong frequency, and she had to track it down and reissue its clearance to cross the runway. Then a Southwest flight announced that it was ready to enter runway 24L, so she told it to hold short. And finally, another SkyWest flight took off on runway 24R and had to be handed to the next controller. Unfortunately, amid these multiple distractions, she simply forgot that SkyWest 5569 was still sitting on runway 24L, awaiting takeoff clearance. Moments later, she cleared USAir flight 1493 to land, unaware that she was making a catastrophic error.</p><p>The fact that Wascher made a mistake was self-evident, as was the fact that that mistake led, more or less directly, to the deaths of 35 people. The media and the public began to question the fate of Ms. Wascher. Should she be punished? Should she lose her job? Did she commit an offense?&nbsp;</p><p>How the authorities choose to handle such a mistake says a lot about our society’s conceptions of justice, culpability, agency, empathy, and even vengeance, because the moral dilemma of what to do about Robin Wascher exists as a struggle between diverging values and, in fact, diverging <em>value systems</em>, rooted in the relative prioritization of individual and systemic responsibility.</p><p>Cutting straight to the case, Wascher was not punished in any way. At first, after being escorted, inconsolable, from the tower premises, her colleagues took her to a hotel and stood guard outside her room to keep the media at bay. Months later, Wascher testified before the NTSB hearings, providing a faithful and earnest recounting of the events as she recalled them. She was even given the opportunity to return to the control tower, but she declined. No one was ever charged with a crime.&nbsp;</p><p>As the aviation industry has learned through hard-won experience, that’s usually how it should be.</p></div>

                                            <p><h2><strong>A brief history of blame</strong></h2>
</p>
                                            <div><p>In the aftermath of a disaster, our immediate reaction is often to search for some <em>person</em> to blame. Authorities frequently vow to “find those responsible” and “hold them to account,” as though disasters happen only when some grinning mischief-maker slams a big red button labeled “press for catastrophe.” That’s not to say that negligence ought to go unpunished. Sometimes there really is a malefactor to blame, but equally often there isn’t, and the result is that normal people who just made a mistake are caught up in the dragnet of vengeance, like the famous 2009 case of six Italian seismologists who were charged for failing to predict a deadly earthquake. But when that happens, what is actually accomplished? Has anything been made <em>better</em>? Or have we simply kicked the can down the road?&nbsp;</p><p>It’s often much more productive to ask <em>why</em> than to ask <em>who</em>. In some industries, this is called a “blameless postmortem,” and in aviation, it’s a long-standing, internationally formalized tradition. In the mid-20th century, when technical investigations of aircraft accidents were first being standardized, an understanding emerged that many crashes were not the result of any particular person’s actions. Most famously, in 1956, the Civil Aeronautics Board’s Bureau of Aviation Safety, the predecessor to today’s NTSB, concluded that no one was at fault in a collision of two airliners over the Grand Canyon because the two crews likely could not have seen each other coming until it was too late. The cause of the accident, they determined, was the lack of any positive means to prevent midair collisions.&nbsp;</p><p>The exact origins of this norm are debatable, but we might speculate that it arose from several factors, including the lack of survivors or witnesses in many early aircraft accidents, which left scant evidence with which to assign fault; the fact that pilots held high status in society and many were reluctant to blame them in the absence of such evidence; and the presumption that flying was dangerous and that disaster was not always an aberration of nature. These realities likely predisposed aeronautical experts to think in terms other than blame.</p><p>The end result was that the aviation industry became one of the first to embrace the concept of a “blameless postmortem” as a legally codified principle underpinning all investigations. In 1951, compelled by the reality that their industry was not widely regarded as safe, aviation experts from around the world gathered to compose Annex 13 to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation. This seminal document aimed to standardize the conduct of air accident investigations among all member states of the International Civil Aviation Organization.&nbsp;</p><p>Annex 13 holds that the primary purpose of an aircraft accident investigation is to prevent future accidents — a decision that implicitly privileged prevention above the search for liability. Conducting a police-style investigation that faults a deceased pilot does nothing to affect the probability of future accidents. To follow the spirit of Annex 13, investigators must ask how others could be prevented from making the same mistakes in the future. This document, and in particular this provision, formed the basis for the modern practice of aircraft accident investigation. Most aircraft accident reports around the world today open with some variant of the principle, such as the NTSB’s disclaimer:</p><p>The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, “accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties…and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person.”</p><p>When liability is not a concern, an investigation has leeway to draw more meaningful conclusions. In the case of the disaster in Los Angeles, if you listen to the tower tapes, you can easily identify the moment Wascher cleared two planes to use the same runway. But if you remove her from the equation, you haven’t made anything safer. That’s because there was nothing special about Wascher — she was simply an average controller with an average record, who came into work that day thinking she would safely control planes for a few hours and then go home. That’s why in interviews with national media her colleagues hammered home a fundamental truth: that what happened to her could have happened to any of them. And if that was the case, then the true cause of the disaster lay somewhere higher, with the way air traffic control was handled at LAX on a systemic level.</p></div>
                                            <p><h2><strong>Lessons in Los Angeles</strong></h2>
</p>
                                            <div><p>If 35 people can die because a single controller made a single mistake, that’s not a system in which we can place our trust. Humans are fallible creatures who make poor decisions, misinterpret data, and forget things. In a system where lives may depend on the accuracy of a single person, disaster is not only probable but, given enough time, <em>inevitable</em>. Barring cases of anomalous recklessness or incompetence, it won’t matter who is sitting in the controller’s chair when the collision happens. And the only way to fix such a system is to end the reliance on individuals by putting in place safeguards against error.</p><p>That’s where the NTSB steps in to uncover the overarching circumstances that made disaster possible. Why was the system dependent on one controller’s accuracy? What factors increased the probability of a mistake? The agency ultimately wrote a lengthy report on these questions, but the findings can be boiled down to the following:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> LAX was equipped with ground radar that helped identify the locations of airplanes on the airport surface. However, it was custom built and finding spare parts was hard, so it was frequently out of service. The ground radar display at Wascher’s station was not working on the day of the accident.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> It was difficult for Wascher to see Intersection 45, where the SkyWest plane was located, because lights on a newly constructed terminal blocked her view.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After clearing the USAir plane to land, Wascher failed to recognize her mistake because she became distracted searching for information about another plane. This information was supposed to have been passed to her by another controller but was not. The information transmission hierarchy at the facility was such that the task of resolving missing data fell to Wascher rather than intermediate controllers whose areas of responsibility were less safety-critical.</p><p><strong>4</strong>. Although it’s inherently risky to instruct a plane to hold on the runway at night or in low visibility, it was legal to do so, and this was done all the time.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Although there was an alarm system to warn of impending midair collisions, it could not warn controllers about traffic conflicts on the ground.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Pilot procedure at SkyWest was to turn on most of the airplane’s lights only after receiving takeoff clearance. Since SkyWest flight 5569 was never cleared for takeoff, most of its lights were off, rendering it almost impossible for the USAir pilots to see.</p><p>With these facts in mind, the events of that night begin to make a lot more sense. In fact, it becomes plain that Wascher’s mistake was only one factor among many, a slight jolt that toppled a house of cards, rather than an earthquake that brought down a solidly constructed edifice. And as a result of these findings, genuine safety improvements have been made, including more reliable ground radar at more airports, automated ground collision alerting technologies, and a national ban on clearing planes to hold on the runway in low visibility. None of these improvements would have been made if the inquiry stopped at <em>who</em> instead of asking <em>why</em>.</p><p>The key takeaway from the success of this approach is that safety improvements are best achieved when an honest mistake is treated as such, regardless of the consequences. This principle underpins what is known in several advanced industries as the “just culture” concept. A just organizational culture recognizes that a high level of operational safety can be achieved only when the root causes of human error are examined; who made a mistake is far less important than why it was made.&nbsp;</p><p>A just culture encourages self-reporting of errors in order to gather as much data about those errors as possible. In contrast, an organization without a just culture will be left unaware of its own vulnerabilities because employees hide their mistakes for fear of retribution. Such an organization will discover those vulnerabilities only when they result in consequences that are impossible to hide.</p><p>Sometimes disasters happen anyway, and when they do, it’s equally critical that the just culture is upheld. Although it can be hard to accept that a mistake that led to loss of life might go unpunished, just culture doesn’t permit us to discriminate based on the magnitude of the consequences — only on the attitude of the person who committed the error. If they were acting in good faith when the mistake occurred, then a harsh reaction would undermine the trust between employees and management that facilitates the just culture. But even more importantly, it would undermine the blameless investigative process that makes modern aviation so safe. Investigative agencies like the NTSB rely on truthful statements from those involved in an accident in order to determine what happened and why, and the truth can’t be acquired when individuals fear punishment for speaking it. Indeed, if Wascher were charged with a crime, her lawyers would have been required to produce a defense, and the investigative waters would have been forever clouded.</p></div>

                                            <p><h2><strong>Sticking the landing</strong></h2>
</p>
                                            <div><p>Examples of this problem can be found throughout aviation history. For instance, in 1983 an Air Canada Boeing 767 famously landed on a drag strip in Manitoba after running out of fuel in flight, an incident known as the “Gimli Glider.” The captain of the flight was found to have taken off without working fuel gauges, in direct contradiction of airworthiness requirements, which stipulate that at least one gauge must be working.</p><p>At that time accident investigations in Canada were assigned to a commission of inquiry led by a judge who possessed the power to recommend criminal prosecution of anyone involved (a power that the NTSB does not wield). During the investigation, the flight’s captain told investigators that he examined the master minimum equipment list, which describes the systems that may be inoperative when dispatching an airplane. He allegedly observed that at least one fuel gauge was required but then learned from a maintenance technician that Air Canada “Maintenance Central” had cleared the plane to fly in that condition, overriding the MMEL.</p><p>However, everyone else who was present, including the first officer and two maintenance techs, denied that anyone had mentioned a clearance from Maintenance Central or that the MMEL was ever consulted. Indeed, not only did Maintenance Central not give the claimed clearance, it lacked the authority to do so even if it wanted to. Considering this testimony, it seems likely that the captain simply failed to check whether dispatch with two inoperative fuel gauges was allowed. But because he could have exposed himself to the threat of prosecution if he admitted to such a lapse, he (or his lawyers) may have come up with the alternative story in order to preclude the possibility of retaliation. Therefore, the exact reason why he decided to take off with no fuel gauges couldn’t be determined conclusively.</p><p>Fortunately, in many countries (including present-day Canada) this is not the case. Not only does the NTSB have no law enforcement power, but its findings are legally inadmissible as evidence of liability. In the United States, Robin Wascher is a shining example of bravery in truth-telling, but plenty of other pilots and controllers who made mistakes have done the same, because assurances exist that what they tell the NTSB will not be used in court.</p><p>Sometimes, employers independently decide to fire pilots involved in accidents, but the practice is subject to heavy criticism from pilots’ unions and just culture experts. Equally as often, pilots who make honest mistakes get to keep their jobs, such as the first officer aboard American Airlines flight 1420, whose failure to arm the ground spoilers before landing in Little Rock in 1999 contributed to a runway overrun accident that killed 11 people. As of 2019 he was still flying for American Airlines — and had been promoted to captain — because his mistake was due to deeper cultural issues in the airline industry. And besides, given what he went through, it’s hard to imagine that he would ever forget to arm the spoilers again.</p><p><strong>***</strong></p><p>The efficacy of just culture and the blameless postmortem is hardly in doubt. The United States has achieved the safest airline industry in the world through rigorous root cause analysis made possible only by a commitment to transparency, justice, and truth. While nothing humanity builds is invincible, the safeguards that we have erected against human error are so formidable that in the 33 years since the crash at LAX, there hasn’t been another fatal runway collision at any U.S. airport with a control tower, even as the media breathlessly reports every near miss. Globally, airline accidents of all causes have been almost eliminated, even as global air traffic increases year-on-year. In 1972, by most measurements the nadir of global aviation safety, approximately one in 200,000 airline passengers worldwide did not reach their destination alive. Half a century later in 2022, this number was one in 17 million. In the U.S., where airline safety has always led the global average, no scheduled passenger airline has had a fatal crash in 15 years.</p><p>The laws of the universe dictate that this unbroken record will one day end, but it’s also true that if we believe responsibility for human errors to lie with the individual, then many more people would be senselessly sacrificed — not only those of the passengers aboard our planes but those of the pilots and air traffic controllers who are responsible for them. Recognizing that mistakes are inevitable has made us all safer by directing our collective energy toward the cause, rather than the symptoms — because the cause of the Los Angeles disaster was not Robin Wascher forgetting about an airplane, but rather an unforgiving system that required her to act with inhuman consistency. Our own humanity compels us to withhold judgment because it makes flying safer, because justice demands it, and because empathy is rewarded in kind.</p></div>

	<div>
		<p>Recently, GTK gained not one, but two new renderers: one for GL and one for Vulkan.</p>
<p>Since naming is hard, we reused existing names and called them “ngl” and “vulkan”. They are built from the same <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/tree/main/gsk/gpu">sources</a>, therefore we also call them “unified” renderers.</p>
<p>But what is exciting about them?</p>
<h3>A single source</h3>
<p>As mentioned already, the two renderers are built from the same source. It is modeled to follow Vulkan apis, with some abstractions to cover the differences between Vulkan and GL (more specifically, GL 3.3+ and GLES 3.0+). This lets us share much of the infrastructure for walking the scene graph, maintaining transforms and other state, caching textures and glyphs, and will make it easier to keep both renderers up-to-date and on-par.</p>
<p>Could this unified approach be extended further, to cover a Metal-based renderer on macOS or a DirectX-based one on Windows? Possibly. The advantage of the Vulkan/GL combination is that they share basically the same shader language (GLSL, with some variations). That isn’t the case for Metal or DirectX. For those platforms, we either need to duplicate the shaders or use a translation tool like <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Cross">SPIRV-Cross</a>.</p>
<p>If that is the kind of thing that excites you, help is welcome.</p>
<h3>Implementation details</h3>
<p>The old GL renderer uses simple shaders for each rendernode type and frequently resorts to offscreen rendering for more complex content. The unified renderers have (more capable) per-node shaders too, but instead of relying on offscreens, they will also use a complex shader that interprets data from a buffer. In game programming, this approach is known as a <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2017/07/30/ubershaders/">ubershader</a>.</p>
<p>The unified renderer implementation is less optimized than the old GL renderer, and has been written with a focus on correctness and maintainability. As a consequence, it can handle much more varied rendernode trees correctly.</p>
<p>Here is an harmless-looking example:</p>
<pre>repeat {
  bounds: 0 0 50 50;
  child: border {
    outline: 0 0 4.3 4.3;
    widths: 1.3;
  }
}</pre>

<h3>New capabilities</h3>
<p>We wouldn’t have done all this work, if there wasn’t some tangible benefit. Of course, there’s new features and capabilities. Lets look at some:</p>
<p><em>Antialiasing. </em>A big problem with the old GL renderer is that it will just lose fine details. If something is small enough to fall between the boundaries of a single line of pixels, it will simply disappear. In particular this can affect&nbsp; underlines, such as mnemonics. The unified renderers handle such cases better, by doing antialiasing. This helps not just for preserving fine detail, but also prevents jagged outlines of primitives.</p>
<figure id="attachment_9805" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9805"><a href="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2024/01/aa.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2024/01/aa-300x150.png" alt="" width="300" height="150" srcset="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2024/01/aa-300x150.png 300w, https://blog.gtk.org/files/2024/01/aa-1024x512.png 1024w, https://blog.gtk.org/files/2024/01/aa-768x384.png 768w, https://blog.gtk.org/files/2024/01/aa-1200x600.png 1200w, https://blog.gtk.org/files/2024/01/aa.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9805">Close-up view of GL vs NGL</figcaption></figure>
<p><em>Fractional scaling. </em>Antialiasing is also the basis that lets us handle fractional scales properly. If your&nbsp; 1200 × 800 window is set to be scaled to 125 %, with the unified renderers, we will use a framebuffer of size 1500 × 1000 for it, instead of letting the compositor downscale a 2400 × 1600 image. Much less pixels, and a sharper image.</p>
<p><em>Arbitrary gradients. </em>The old GL renderer handles linear, radial and conic gradients with up to 6 color stops. The unified renders allow an <em>unlimited</em> number of color stops. The new renderers also apply antialiasing to gradients, so sharp edges will have smooth lines.</p>
<figure id="attachment_9895" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9895"><a href="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2024/01/lg1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.gtk.org/files/2024/01/lg1.png" alt="" width="301" height="47"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9895">A linear gradient with 64 color stops</figcaption></figure>
<p><em>Dmabufs. </em>As a brief detour from the new renderers, we worked on dmabuf support and graphics offloading <a href="https://blog.gtk.org/2023/11/15/introducing-graphics-offload/">last fall</a>. The new renderers support this and extend it to create dmabufs when asked to produce a texture via the <a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gsk4/method.Renderer.render_texture.html">render_texture</a> api (currently, just the Vulkan renderer).</p>
<h3>Any sharp edges?</h3>
<p>As is often the case, with new capabilities comes the potential for new gotchas. Here are some things to be aware of, as an app developer:</p>
<p><em>No more glshader nodes.</em> Yes, they made for some fancy demos for 4.0, but they are very much tied to the old GL renderer, since they make assumptions about the GLSL api exposed by that renderer. Therefore, the new renderers don’t support them.</p>
<p>You have been warned in the docs:</p>
<blockquote><p>If there is a problem, this function returns FALSE and reports an error. You should use this function before relying on the shader for rendering and use a fallback with a simpler shader or without shaders if it fails.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thankfully, many uses of the glshader node are no longer necessary, since GTK has gained new features since 4.0, such as mask nodes and support for straight-alpha textures.</p>
<p><em>Fractional positions.</em> The old GL renderer is rounding things, so you could get away with handing it fractional positions. The new renderers will place things where you tell it. This can sometimes have unintended <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/6361">consequences</a>, so should be on the lookout and make sure that your positions are where they should be.</p>
<p>In particular, look out for out for cairo-style drawing where you place lines at half-pixel positions so they fill out one row of pixels precisely.</p>
<p><em>Driver problems. </em>The new renderers are using graphics drivers in new and different ways, so there is potential for triggering problems on that side.</p>
<p>Please file problems you see against GTK even if they look like driver issues, since it is useful for us to get an overview how well (or badly) the new code works with the variety of drivers and hardware out there.</p>
<h3>But is it faster?</h3>
<p>No, the new renderers are not faster (yet).</p>
<p>The old GL renderer is heavily optimized for speed. It also uses much simpler shaders, and does not do the math that is needed for features such as antialiasing. We want to make the new renderers faster eventually, but the new features and correctness make them very exciting, even before we reach that goal. All of the GPU-based renderers are more than fast enough to render todays GTK apps at 60 or 144 fps.</p>
<p>That being said, the Vulkan renderer comes close to matching and surpassing the old GL renderer in some unscientific benchmarks. The new GL renderer is slower for some reason that we have not tracked down yet.</p>
<h3>New defaults</h3>
<p>In the just-released 4.13.6 snapshot, we have made the ngl renderer the new default. This is a trial balloon — the renderers need wider testing with different apps too verify that they are ready for production. If significant problems appear, we can revert back to the gl renderer for 4.14.</p>
<p>We decided not make the Vulkan renderer the default yet, since it is behind the GL renderers in a few application integration aspects: the webkit GTK4 port works with GL, not with Vulkan, and GtkGLArea and GtkMediaStream currently both produce GL textures that the Vulkan renderer can’t directly import. All of these issues will hopefully be addressed in the not-too-distant future, and then we will revisit the default renderer decision.</p>
<p>If you are using GTK on very old hardware, you may be better off with the old GL renderer, since it makes fewer demands on the GPU. You can override the renderer selection using the GSK_RENDERER environment variable:</p>
<pre>GSK_RENDERER=gl</pre>
<h3>Future plans and possibilities</h3>
<p>The new renderers are a good foundation to implement things that we’ve wanted to have for a long time, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper color handling (including HDR)</li>
<li>Path rendering on the GPU</li>
<li>Possibly including glyph rendering</li>
<li>Off-the-main-thread rendering</li>
<li>Performance (on old and less powerful devices)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these will be a focus of our work in the near and medium-term future.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>I spent a fair portion of my adult life working for large tech companies. In all my interactions with peers, no other topic caused as much cynicism and angst as the question of performance management — that is, the labyrinthine processes the companies follow for deciding who to fire and who to reward for exemplary work.</p><p>Much of this anxiety arose from the belief that Big Tech wanted to instill a cutthroat environment where you’re always compelled to do your best. I don’t think that’s true: in rapidly growing companies with easy access to funding, there is no intrinsic incentive to fire mediocre staff. The process is stressful to managers, legally risky, and harmful to morale. This tendency to accumulate slack is precisely why profitable tech companies panic and go through overdue layoffs whenever the economic outlook turns for the worse.</p><p>The actual reason for performance management is that your employees are sticklers for fairness. The exact dollar figure on your paycheck matters a lot less than knowing there’s another person who does less and somehow earns more. As a manager, in every other 1:1, you hear your subordinates comparing themselves to others and demanding explanations for any perceived slights. Harboring low performers has corrosive effects on team dynamics — doubly so in places that attract talent through the mythos of only hiring the best.</p><p>For a long time, the prevailing corporate approach to performance management was to let the manager decide. After all, they had the expertise and the familiarity with the problem space, so it was believed that they’re best equipped to dole out punishment and deliver rewards. But this led to problems: some teams developed a reputation for leniency, and others for being too harsh. More insidiously, the setup allowed rumors to spread: a manager could be accused of giving preferential treatment to their buddies or love interests, with no way to disprove such claims; every company sooner or later developed extensive lore of this sort.</p><p>All this changed with Google. In its early years, the company sought to do things differently, and reinventing performance management was fair game. Google ultimately converged on a peer-based system where your performance is evaluated not by your boss, but by a selection of your coworkers. This promised greater fairness and improved transparency. Over the years, the model spread like a wildfire to other tech companies — and sometimes beyond.</p><p>Of course, the model imposed considerable burden across the company: once or twice a year, the entire business would grind to a halt as every employee was writing self-assessments and peer feedback, and then a significant proportion of senior staff was serving on committees. But the benefits seemed obvious — and well worth the price.</p><p>Except, the benefits never really materialized. The problem is that every employee is judged by their ability to get work done; in most roles, this depends on being able to get along with others, including strangers with different sensibilities and unfamiliar backgrounds. Providing honest, critical feedback is a significant and ultimately unnecessary social risk. It doesn’t help that the burden of the process prompts most to put the bare minimum of effort into individual reviews; a handful of platitudes is usually enough to get you through it and get back to work.</p><p>In the end, the feedback for most employees ends up being overwhelmingly positive — and uniformly bland. The usual exceptions are the absolute worst performers who wouldn’t survive under any other performance management regime; as well as a handful of unlucky folks who deliver solid results but lack social grace and self-promotion skills.</p><p>This outcome puts the organization in an unenviable position. To fix this, the managers are tasked with “interpreting” the feedback to arrive at some sort of a normalized ranking that can be used as a basis for firings, promotions, and bonuses. This happens behind the scenes in stuffy multi-hour meetings where the data is shuffled and massaged until it fits on some reasonable curve. The illusion of a peer-driven system is maintained — but in reality, for layoffs and compensation, the manager almost always makes the call, and peer feedback seldom reveals anything new.</p><p>To be fair, the promotion process can be different: in many places, it’s delegated to an independent committee of senior employees. The panel is unlikely to promote if the manager doesn’t support the bid, but on the flip side, having your manager’s blessing doesn’t guarantee success. The goal is to maintain a consistently high bar, but this comes at a hefty price. The committee is tasked with deciphering voluminous but sloppy feedback without the benefit of knowing the employee or understanding their work. In the end, they regularly deliver random, unsatisfying verdicts. “You’re doing great, we just need to structure your packet differently for the next cycle” is a common utterance when delivering the bad news.</p><p>The kicker is that the internal perception of this Google-originating process isn’t necessarily any better than that of what it sought to replace. At a great organizational cost, it merely traded the accusations of manager-level favoritism for grander conspiracy theories — sinister corporate agendas divined from the words of secretive, amorphous committees.</p><p>The promise of a more egalitarian performance management process is a part of the mythos of Big Tech; but it’s also a fascinating study of painting oneself into a corner, unable to walk back.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-162064">

	
	
	
	<div>
		<!-- Ad-Auris -->
		
		<p><span>T</span><span>he story was charming:</span> a short article about soups, continually replenished for decades, secreted in jars across oceans. The soups, according to one source, were “older than Taylor Swift.” I devoured the article, published in December 2022 on <em><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Atlas Obscura</a></em>, an online publication billed as “best-in-class journalism about hidden places, incredible history, scientific marvels, and gastronomical wonders,” and texted it to a few soup-obsessed friends. Then I forgot about it for months until the weather turned chilly and I pulled up the link again, only to notice the article had changed. An italicized editor’s note had been added to the top, which began: “This article has been retracted as it does not meet Atlas Obscura’s editorial standards.” The note went on to state that multiple details and interviews had been fabricated. </p>

<p>Intrigued, I did a Google search for the author, Blair Mastbaum. His social media profiles and Wikipedia page suggested an American writer in his mid-forties, very active on Instagram, where he posted captionless photos of his travels in Europe. Mastbaum had written ten other articles for <em>Atlas Obscura</em>, eight of which, it turned out, had similar retractions. Topics ranged widely: acoustic archeology, Hawaiian cultural appropriation, an obscure dialect of sign language. Mastbaum’s first retracted story had been published in January 2022; the last one more than a year later. </p>

<p>His final article, from February 2023, was about the Scottish town of Moffat implementing “dark weeks” to protect the night sky from artificial lighting. Except: the townsfolk of Moffat had never done such a thing; experts and locals quoted in the story had never been contacted or interviewed, and at least one does not seem to actually exist. It was an astonishing volume of lies packed neatly into an 1,100-word article. Fiction masquerading as journalism is nothing new, but in the age of Google Alerts and plagiarism checkers, it seems like it ought to be impossible to sustain a year-long series of audacious lies. How can a writer still pull off a con like this? And given the endless opportunities for scamming anonymously, why would anyone undertake such revealing and labour-intensive deceptions? </p>
<p>Founded in 2009, <em>Atlas Obscura</em> is an online publication specializing in descriptions and stories of offbeat destinations, created as the antithesis of the well-trod itineraries offered by popular guidebooks. It has attracted millions of dollars in funding and expanded into a travel planning app, a retail review site, and a food-focused vertical called Gastro Obscura. The editorial mission is to tell true stories that seem, at first glance, to be stranger than fiction, which is perhaps why Mastbaum’s strange fictions seemed so plausible. His stories weren’t outlandish; they were well researched and populated with factual details, with believable quotes attributed to real people. Writing them was at least as much work as reporting truthfully would have been, suggesting they weren’t born of intellectual or professional laziness but some other, more inscrutable, motivation. </p>
<p>It seems likely that everything unravelled with the final article about Moffat, which also bore the longest editor’s note—perhaps Mastbaum had gotten carried away with his ornamental flourishes. One of the sources who denied speaking with Mastbaum, an urban planner from Poland named Agata Łopuszyńska, replied to my message in which I’d asked how she had found out about the article. “That’s a crazy story,” she wrote back. Łopuszyńska learned about the article when a man from a dark-sky organization in the UK emailed to ask her about it. She had never been to Scotland or heard of Mastbaum and was shocked to see quotes, and even photographs included in the article, attributed to her. Soon after other baffled sources reached out to <em>Atlas Obscura</em>, Łopuszyńska was contacted by an editor, who told her about an email exchange between himself and Łopuszyńska that Mastbaum had provided as proof that he had interviewed her. It even included a fake Polish phone number, Łopuszyńska said, which Mastbaum had told <em>Atlas Obscura</em> he had used to contact her on WhatsApp. Łopuszyńska doesn’t use WhatsApp. The email exchange had been fabricated. Most bizarre was a one-word email (“hello”) Łopuszyńska found in her junk folder, sent by Mastbaum two weeks after the story had been published. </p>

<p>Łopuszyńska wished the entire article had been removed from <em>Atlas Obscura</em>’s website, not just appended with an editor’s note. “For me it would be best to no longer see my name in such a scam,” she wrote to me. When I spoke with Samir S. Patel, editor-in-chief of <em>Atlas Obscura</em>, he acknowledged that they had unpublished some of Mastbaum’s stories. “But that’s not proper journalistic practice,” he said. When the errors in the Moffat piece came to light, the website conducted an investigation and temporarily unpublished stories as other issues emerged. Afterward, they republished those stories, without their images and with the addition of editor’s notes. “We want there to be a record,” he explained. It was the same approach taken by the <em>New York Times</em> in 2002, when its editors discovered errors and fabrications in Michael Finkel’s reporting on child slavery in West Africa, and in 2003, when the newspaper discovered that staff reporter Jayson Blair had fabricated details in at least thirty-six stories.</p>
<p>For Patel, a Brooklyn-based science journalist who joined <em>Atlas Obscura</em> in 2017, the incident was perplexing and painful. Mastbaum’s stories didn’t raise any red flags, he said; details were spot-checked by editors, and notes were provided whenever they had questions. They didn’t suspect anything was amiss until a reader reached out to them. Once they realized there were problems with the story, he explained, they did a complete review of all of Mastbaum’s work, reaching out to every single source and documenting the inconsistencies in an editor’s note. According to Patel, Mastbaum ghosted them after the editors notified him of the full review. Patel still stands behind their editorial process. “I wouldn’t say we’ve changed it,” he says. “But I’ll put it this way: it’s changed us a little bit.” They’re a little less trusting than they used to be. </p>
<p>A constellation of online profiles suggests Mastbaum is a lapsed novelist and former copywriter who lives in Europe with his partner, filmmaker Scott Coffey. Coffey is best known for writing and directing the 2005 film <em>Ellie Parker</em>, starring the Australian actress Naomi Watts. When Mastbaum organized a GoFundMe for Coffey’s dental expenses in the summer of 2023, a donor named Naomi Watts contributed $2,000—a detail worthy of a fabulist. On Instagram, Mastbaum documented his travels in the UK and Spain, places that later appeared in his <em>Atlas Obscura</em> stories. Online, it’s easy to glean enough details about a stranger’s life to assemble a vivid but superficial portrait of them—but impossible to map their mysterious interior trajectory, from writing queer coming-of-age novels to publishing fraudulent travel journalism. </p>
<p>Aside from <em>Atlas Obscura</em>, his only significant journalism credit, Mastbaum published similar stories on a now-idle Substack: quirky, detailed digressions into cultural practices and his experiences abroad. Most were about Europe, but one caught my eye because it was about a nation closer to home: the Kwakwaka’wakw tribes of coastal BC. The post included a quote from Jennifer Kramer, an associate professor of anthropology and museum curator at the University of British Columbia. I sent her an email to ask if she had ever spoken with this writer. No, she wrote back quickly, adding, “It is disturbing to learn that he has falsely cited me.” Some details included in the post, Kramer told me, were accurate, while others were completely wrong. I looked up a quote attributed to the famous anthropologist Franz Boas and found that it came from a book by another scholar, written eight years after Boas died. The overall effect of the post was similar to that of one of those AI-generated images of a person with too many fingers: almost but not quite convincing. “Parts of the descriptions stem from accuracy but they have become distorted or read completely wrong to produce stereotypical or offensive results,” Kramer replied. (I ran the Substack post through Copyleaks, an online tool that promises to tell you “with exceptional accuracy” whether a piece of text has been authored by AI. It came back as definitively human.)</p>
<p>Patel said the review of Mastbaum’s reporting by <em>Atlas Obscura</em> editors revealed a similarly confounding mix of fact and fiction. “Some [of his sources] got back to us and said, ‘Yes, this is an accurate reflection of the conversation that I had with this writer.’ Others got back to us and said, ‘I feel like I said this, but I don’t think I said this in this case.’ Or ‘I have said this, but I didn’t talk to this writer and I’ve never heard of this person in my life.’” Two of Mastbaum’s earliest articles passed editorial review, apparently free of falsehoods. </p>

<p>Mastbaum’s stories continue a long tradition of journalistic fabrications, which often involve the distortion of some exotic culture or milieu: Finkel’s falsified reporting on child slavery in West Africa; Stephen Glass’s fictionalized voyage into the heart of a hacker convention; Janet Cooke’s story “Jimmy’s World,” a sordid tale about the eponymous eight-year-old heroin addict that was briefly honoured with a Pulitzer Prize before Cooke’s lies unravelled. There’s a kind of dynamic voyeurism at play, appealing to stereotypes and preconceived ideas, which lends it the quality that Stephen Colbert once described as “truthiness.” The reader feels as though they are peering through a window into the real world, unaware that the very pane of glass they are looking through is warped. The lies themselves are harmful, but so too is our inability to recognize them. </p>
<p>For Nieman Lab, professor and journalist Charlie Beckett writes, “In the wake of all the untrustworthy content online, journalists have forgotten that it used to be axiomatic that ‘you shouldn’t believe what you read in the papers.’” Patel pointed out the same thing to me. “Go back a hundred years . . . and people took journalism with a grain of salt,” he said. “Then there was a period where journalists were really trusted and seen as gatekeepers—the Cronkite era.” Now we’re back in a cynical phase: in 2023, the Reuters Institute Digital News Report found only 37 percent of English-speaking Canadians trust the news. </p>
<p>It’s not a bad thing that we’re more skeptical of the media, that we challenge what confronts us with questions. The problem is that skepticism itself does not equip us to distinguish between fact and fiction. In 2019, almost 40 percent of surveyed Canadians admitted in an Ipsos poll that they had been suckered at least once by fake news, a percentage that perhaps not coincidentally spiked with the advent of AI tools like Midjourney and DALL-E 3, which can produce increasingly realistic-looking images. And after another year of layoffs that continued to decimate the hollowed-out media industry, it’s also harder for media organizations to stay on top of. Patel acknowledged that <em>Atlas Obscura</em> relies on editors to check articles, but few outlets allocate a budget or time to dedicated fact checking. </p>
<p>Distrust of mainstream media is one reason why a growing number of people are relying on social media, like TikTok, as a primary source of news, despite the fact that platforms are rife with misinformation: a 2022 investigation by NewsGuard found that one in five search results on TikTok contained false claims. But examples of misinformation spawn indiscriminately across platforms, because they share a fundamental structure: they are designed to incentivize engagement. It’s a technological expression of the fabricator’s logic—a hierarchy of attention over accuracy. </p>
<p>Mastbaum’s fabrications were convincing for the same reason any fakery is: burnished with captivating details and memorable quotes, they were almost better than real. Why a middle-aged former novelist would craft such elaborate fabrications and lies about old broth for fifty cents a word is harder to answer. Mastbaum didn’t respond to my emails or DMs on Instagram for comment, but I didn’t really expect him to. He knows as well as I do that the real explanation could never be as interesting as a story.</p>

It started out well enough. They offered me sweat equity upfront (no cliffs or vesting) so that showed a lot of trust. 
As time went on, him and his partner began spooling off different companies with no intimation and conflicts of interests. They even diluted my stake without informing. I waited till I was 4 years complete, asked them to hike up my equity stake by a few points as the business while running was not making a load of cash and the salary I was drawing was peanuts compared to the market offers I was saying no to.
They didn't respond on that request for a year. Put in my papers. As to how our childhood friendship fared. He had a child recently and I found out via common friends :-)<p>After a stint in another startup, have joined another friend at his startup. It is hard but there is much better transparency. Only time will tell though if the friendship will survive the stint (I hope it does).

A bit later I got an email from someone in their office that they regretted they didn’t have any positions that fit my experience.</p><p>Later my friend (and his wife) encouraged me to do the homework thing again but I laughed them off. I didn’t want to work for a small company that somehow had hamstrung itself with unnecessary processes that kept the founder from hiring someone he wanted to hire.</p><p>A few years later they sold and a couple engineers I know made multiple millions.

I had a former manager and friend work for me, and there are definitely friends I would work for in a heartbeat in the future.<p>It will also probably be hard for your friend to deliver tough feedback to you, so you may have to work extra hard to solicit real feedback.

That type of work I find soul draining, because I refuse to be at the whims of bad corporates with big wallets.</p><p>I had also wanted to put more effort to improving the developer experience of the project as it was poor, but could never quite slot in enough time or motivation, and felt it went unappreciated.</p><p>Eventually the higher ups pulled me in to effectively put me on a PIP.

I didn't take equity, but asked for more cash compensation, with a specific time duration. We parted ways amicably when we didn't come to terms around my compensation package almost a year later. We're still friends and chat often.<p>I think being very clear with yourself, your partner (if applicable), and your friend-employer, while being able to engage in potentially tough conversations in a friendly manner will go a long way to managing expectations on all sides.

Simply because some trust is required on both sides. Otherwise it's hard to build skilled team to work for a company that dont offer any benefits except for equity while can go down at any moment.<p>IMO this is all about expectations. If you never lied to your friend about your actual experience and skillset and your friend offers reasonable compensation then it's win win situation. Working on a team of like-minded people is amazing.

On the employee side, you now have to respect your friend as a leader (so it will no longer be a friendship on equal terms) and not expect any beneficial treatment as that will reflect badly on his relationship with other employees. On the employer side your friend now has a greater responsibility for your financial stability, which is quite stressful because there will be a greater emotional attachment to this responsibility. My advice is: if you want to help your friend out offer them a casual liberal contract until their business gets rolling. If you want to work for your mate because you have trouble finding another job always remember that your friend is doing you a massive favour and try your best to be a model employee. Otherwise do not do it, and retain your friend as someone you can complain to about your asshol boss who is not your friend :)</span></p></div></td></tr>

Meanwhile our employees were constantly late being paid, and we were at risk of eviction from our office. Since I was the “technical one” (we are both software engineers) and his other company was fintech, we both agreed he should be responsible for the money but I don’t think he ever paid a bill on time and I would constantly have to remind him.</p><p>As soon as the money from the accelerator hit the bank account, he stopped paying for everything and left town with all the money, leaving the car he had shipped out sitting in the parking lot for months. I went to our investors and was advised to resign to shield myself from legal consequences. He accepted my resignation, the company failed, and we haven’t spoken since.

  <p>
    nullprogram.com/blog/2024/01/28/
  </p>

  <p>Over the past couple months I’ve discovered a couple of handy tricks for
working with GDB breakpoints. I figured these out on my own, and I’ve not
seen either discussed elsewhere, so I really ought to share them.</p>

<h3 id="continuable-assertions">Continuable assertions</h3>

<p>The <code>assert</code> macro in typical C implementations <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2022/06/26/">leaves a lot to be
desired</a>, and so I’ve suggested alternative definitions that
behave better under debuggers:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#define assert(c)  while (!(c)) __builtin_trap()
#define assert(c)  while (!(c)) __builtin_unreachable()
#define assert(c)  while (!(c)) *(volatile int *)0 = 0
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Each serves a slightly <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2023/10/08/#macros">different purpose</a> but still has the most
important property: Immediately halt the program <em>directly on the defect</em>.
None have an occasionally useful secondary property: Optionally allow the
program to continue through the defect. If the program reaches the body of
any of these macros then there is no reliable continuation. Even manually
nudging the instruction pointer over the assertion isn’t enough. Compilers
assume that the program cannot continue through the condition and generate
code accordingly.</p>

<p>The MSVC ecosystem has a solution for this on x86: <code>int3</code>. The portable
name is <code>__debugbreak</code>, a name <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2022/07/31/">I’ve borrowed elsewhere</a>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#define assert(c)  do if (!(c)) __debugbreak(); while (0)
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>On x86 it inserts an <code>int3</code> instruction, which fires an interrupt,
trapping in the attached debugger, or otherwise abnormally terminating the
program. Because it’s an interrupt, it’s expected that the program might
continue. It even leaves the instruction pointer on the next instruction.
As of this writing, GCC has no matching intrinsic, but Clang recently
added <code>__builtin_debugtrap</code>. In GCC you need some less portable inline
assembly: <code>asm ("int3")</code>.</p>

<p>However, regardless of how you get an <code>int3</code> in your program, GDB does not
currently understand it. The problem is that feature I mentioned: The
instruction pointer does not point at the <code>int3</code> but the next instruction.
This confuses GDB, causing it to break in the wrong places, possibly even
in the wrong scope. For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
    <span>int3_assert</span><span>(...);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With <code>int3</code> at the very end of the loop, GDB will break at the <em>top</em> of
the next loop iteration, because that’s where the instruction pointer
lands by the time GDB is involved. It’s a similar story when placed at the
end of a function, leaving GDB to break in the caller. To resolve this, we
need the instruction pointer to still be “inside” the breakpoint after the
interrupt fires. Easy! Add a <code>nop</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#define breakpoint()  asm ("int3; nop")
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This behaves beautifully, eliminating all the problems GDB has with a
plain <code>int3</code>. Not only is this a solid basis for a continuable assertion,
it’s also useful as a fast conditional breakpoint, where conventional
conditional breakpoints are far too slow.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>1000000000</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>/* rare condition */</span><span>)</span> <span>breakpoint</span><span>();</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>As far as I know there is no ARM equivalent compatible with GDB (or even
LLDB). The closest instruction, <code>brk #0x1</code>, does not behave as needed.</p>

<h3 id="named-positions">Named positions</h3>

<p>GDB’s built-in user interface understands three classes of breakpoint
positions: symbols, context-free line numbers, and absolute addresses.
When you set some breakpoints and (re)start a program under GDB, each kind
of breakpoint is handled differently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Resolve each symbol, placing a breakpoint on its run-time address.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Map each file+lineno tuple to a run-time address, and place a breakpoint
on that address. If the line does not exist (i.e. the file is shorter),
skip it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Place breakpoints exactly on each absolute address. If it’s not a mapped
address, don’t start the program.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The first is the best case because it adapts to program changes. Modify
the code, recompile, and the breakpoint generally remains where you want
it.</p>

<p>The third is the least useful. These breakpoints rarely survive across
rebuilds, and sometimes not even across reruns.</p>

<p>The second is in the middle between useful and useless. If you edit the
source file which has the breakpoint — likely, because you placed the
breakpoint there for a reason — chances are high that the line number is
no longer correct. Instead it drifts, requiring manual replacement. This
is tedious and GDB ought to do better. Think that’s unreasonable? The
Visual Studio debugger does exactly that <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~skeeto/public-inbox/%3C2d3d7662a361ddd049f7dc65b94cecdd%40disroot.org%3E#%3C20240112210447.mxhvo7bg4mjp4jyz@nullprogram.com%3E">quite effectively</a> through
external code edits! GDB front ends tend to handle it better, especially
when they’re also the code editor, and so directly observes all edits.</p>

<p>As a workaround we can get the first kind by temporarily <em>naming</em> a line
number. This requires editing the source, but remember, the very reason we
need it is because the source in question is actively changing. How to
name a line? C and C++ labels give a name to program position:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>example</span><span>(</span><span>double</span> <span>*</span><span>nums</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>...)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>loop:</span>  <span>// named position at the start of the loop</span>
        <span>// ...</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The name <code>loop</code> is local to <code>example</code>, but the qualified <code>example:loop</code> is
a global name, as suitable as any other symbol. I could, say, reliably
trace the progress of this loop despite changes to its position in the
source.</p>

<div><pre><code>(gdb) dprintf example:loop,"nums[%d] = %g\n",i,nums[i]
</code></pre></div>

<p>One downside is dealing with <code>-Wunused-label</code> (enabled by <code>-Wall</code>), and so
I’ve considered disabling the warning in <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2023/04/29/">my defaults</a>. I more often
use an assembly label, usually named <code>b</code> for convenience:</p>

<div><pre><code>    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>asm</span> <span>(</span><span>"b:"</span><span>);</span>
        <span>// ...</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Like <code>int3</code>, sometimes it’s necessary to give it a <code>nop</code> so that GDB has
something on which to break. “Enabling” it at any time is quick:</p>



<p>Because it’s not <a href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/Global.html"><code>.globl</code></a>, it’s a weak symbol, and I can place up to
one per translation unit, all covered by the same GDB breakpoint item
(less useful than it sounds). I haven’t actually checked, but I probably
more often use <code>dprintf</code> with such named lines than actual breakpoints.</p>

<p>If you have similar tips and tricks of your own, I’d like to learn about
them!</p>

1906w"></figure><div><p>Quick side note: How the actual fuck does GitHub NOT have a report button on a piece of user generated content. Do you know the process of reporting this? <strong>Copy Link</strong> -&gt; <strong>Go to user’s profile page</strong> -&gt; <strong>Click Block &amp; Report</strong> -&gt; <strong>Click Report Abuse button</strong> -&gt; <strong>*New page* Click “I want to report harmful… cryptocurrency abuse”</strong> -&gt; <strong>Click “I want to report suspicious cryptocurrency or mining content.” button</strong> -&gt; <strong>FINALLY</strong> paste the link you copied 10 years ago into the form box and give your justification on why this user did a bad thing and hope that the link still works/content is still up by the time they get around to looking at it…</p><p>That is 7 different steps on 3 different pages with multiple models/dropdowns… Come on, that is WAY to much. I have never reported these before because it was too much work, I legit gave up and just ignored it because I knew it was a scam and wasn’t going to fall for it. <em>IF YOU WANT YOUR USERS TO HELP YOU, MAKE IT EASY FOR THEM!</em></p><p>*Sorry, had to get that off my chest. It always seems that Trust and Safety UI/UX things like that are give little time and thought because they are not the cool sexy and flashy features that users see or care about most of the time…. until the spam starts!</p></div><h2>The Fix</h2><p>So what can be done about this? What can GitHub do? I have a couple of “simple” ideas. I say simple because I realize that not only is user-generated content moderation an uphill battle, but doing it at scale adds another level of complexity to it all.<br></p><div><p>If a user is posting multiple comments in a relatively short period of time (lets say a day), have some system that checks to see if it’s a 95% copy and paste to all of their other issues? Ok, this could snag some real users who, say, use templates in their PRs or issues. Fine, there must be some way to rate that account on a number of other factors and their past activity. If they have no repos, no commits in any repos (public or private), no profile picture, no bio, no SSH keys, etc etc, and all they are doing is making comments…. That is a lot of red flags to me personally. </p><p>Another “simple” idea, is to compare comments site wide with each other. They are using the same heading, same body, same image, same links, and just checking who they are tagging. That is a pretty big red flag for me as well. Also, tagging 20 people (even 10 people) at a time can be a red flag. Maybe not once or twice, but if they do it multiple times and always to different users, then that should trigger something to prevent them from posting.</p></div><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>With the rise of generative AI and ChatGPT being able to write endless variations of 1 spam template to bypass the similarity check I just proposed above, content moderation will continue to be an uphill battle. It most likely will get even harder! I am a bit surprised though about GitHub’s, seemingly, lack of ability to handle this sort of spam. I am 100% sure (no proof, though) that intelligent people are already working on this at GitHub, but it’s a clear that they need a concrete plan moving forward. They need to put some real effort into it. Hell, train some AI to auto-filter or auto-rank comments before they get posted. If there are too many red flags, then hold those comments for human moderation before letting it be posted. Spam is nothing new, and I am sure that spam on GitHub is nothing new, but it seems to be getting worse and the only thing getting better are the spammers.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Today, as you must sure­ly know, marks the 50th&nbsp;anniver­sary of John F. Kennedy’s assas­si­na­tion and also sure­ly marks a revival of inter­est in the myr­i­ad con­spir­a­cy the­o­ries that abound in the absence of a sat­is­fac­to­ry expla­na­tion for the events at Dealey Plaza on Novem­ber 22nd, 1963. One the­o­ry I’ve nev­er heard float­ed before comes to us via <a href="http://www.mml.cam.ac.uk/french/staff/am260/">Andy Mar­tin</a>, lec­tur­er in French at Cam­bridge Uni­ver­si­ty and author of <a href="http://amzn.to/1bHskdg"><i>The Box­er and the Goal­keep­er: Sartre vs Camus</i></a>. In an <a href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/art-books/camus-sartre-fbi-hoover/#.Uo7ii6UkTwK">arti­cle for <i>Prospect</i> mag­a­zine</a>, Mar­tin writes:</p>
<p>To the massed ranks of the CIA, the Mafia, the KGB, Cas­tro, Hoover, and LBJ, we can now add: Jean-Paul Sartre. FBI and State Depart­ment reports of the 1960s had drawn atten­tion to Sartre’s mem­ber­ship of the Fair Play for Cuba Com­mit­tee, of which Lee Har­vey Oswald was also a mem­ber. And—prophetically?—Sartre had “dis­missed the US as a head­less nation.” […] Could he, after all, have been the Sec­ond Shoot­er?</p>
<p>It’s prob­a­bly fair to say that Martin’s tongue is wedged firm­ly in his cheek through­out this open­ing of his fas­ci­nat­ing chron­i­cle of the FBI’s sur­veil­lance of <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sartre/">Sartre</a> and his one­time friend and edi­tor <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/camus/">Albert Camus</a>. But Martin’s inter­est in the mis­al­liance of Sartre and the Feds is very seri­ous. What he finds dur­ing his inves­ti­ga­tion of the FBI files on exis­ten­tial­ism is that “the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Man_(slang)">G‑men</a>, ini­tial­ly so anti-philo­soph­i­cal, find them­selves reluc­tant­ly phi­los­o­phiz­ing. They become (in GK Chesterton’s phrase) <i>philo­soph­i­cal police­men</i>.”</p>


<p>While we have become accus­tomed, since the days of Joe McCarthy, to ide­o­log­i­cal witch hunts, it seems that Sartre and Camus served as test cas­es for the sort of thing that fre­quent­ly plays out in over­heat­ed Con­gres­sion­al hear­ings and media denunciations—agents with fur­rowed brows and lit­tle philo­soph­i­cal train­ing des­per­ate­ly try­ing to work out whether such and such abstruse aca­d­e­m­ic is part of a grand con­spir­a­cy to under­mine truth, jus­tice, the Amer­i­can Way, etc.. Sartre appeared ear­ly on the anti-Com­mu­nist radar, though, iron­i­cal­ly, he did so as a plant of sorts, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/us/when-sartre-and-camus-met-hoovers-g-men.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;">brought over in 1945</a> by the Office of War Infor­ma­tion as part of a group of jour­nal­ists the Unit­ed States’ gov­ern­ment hoped would put out good pro­pa­gan­da.</p>
<p>“Hoover won­dered,” how­ev­er, writes Mar­tin, “what kind of good pro­pa­gan­da you can hope to get out of the author of <i>Nau­sea</i> and <i>Being and Noth­ing­ness</i>.” It turned out, not much, but a year lat­er Hoover latched on to Sartre’s friend and edi­tor Albert Camus, whose name he and his agents spelled, var­i­ous­ly, as “Canus” or “Corus.” Where Sartre had breezed into the country—smitten by its lit­er­a­ture and music—Camus was held at immi­gra­tion on Hoover’s orders. He would spend a brief, depress­ing time and nev­er return.</p>
<p>How we get from post-war sur­veil­lance of French exis­ten­tial­ist philoso­phers to Sartre and the grassy knoll is a long and com­pli­cat­ed tale, befit­ting the para­noid imag­in­ings of J. Edgar Hoover. He was, after all, the con­spir­a­cy the­o­rist <i>par excel­lence</i> and “he need­ed to know,” writes Mar­tin, “if Exis­ten­tial­ism and Absur­dism were some kind of front for Com­mu­nism. To him, every­thing was poten­tial­ly a cod­ed re-write of the Com­mu­nist Man­i­festo.” What Hoover feared from Sartre, how­ev­er, was that the lat­ter was him­self an influ­en­tial believ­er in a con­spir­a­cy, one that cast doubt on the FBI’s strong­ly-held belief that Oswald was the lone gun­man.</p>
<p>Despite gath­er­ing years of NSA-wor­thy sur­veil­lance on the philoso­phers, Hoover’s agents were nev­er able to dis­cern the ide­o­log­i­cal pro­gram of the French. “I can’t work out,” wrote one in a note in Sartre’s file, “if he’s pro-Com­mu­nist or anti-Com­mu­nist.” The black-and-white, spy-vs-spy world of the FBI left lit­tle room for philo­soph­i­cal nuance and lit­er­ary ambi­gu­i­ty, after all. But they nev­er stopped watch­ing Sartre, con­vinced that “there must be some kind of con­spir­a­cy between com­mu­nists, blacks, poets and French philoso­phers.” As it turns out, there were several—political and aes­thet­ic con­spir­a­cies involv­ing such ter­ri­fy­ing fig­ures as Frantz Fanon and Aimé Césaire. These poets and close rela­tions of Sartre did, indeed, help foment rev­o­lu­tion in the Caribbean and elsewhere—but theirs are sto­ries for anoth­er day.</p>

<p>Years ago I spent some time <a href="https://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2013/12/08/hacking-a-candleflicker-led/">analyzing Candle-Flicker LEDs</a> that contain an integrated circuit to mimic the flickering nature of real candles. Artificial candles have evolved quite a bit since then, now including magnetically actuated “flames”, an even better candle-emulation. However, at the low end, there are still simple candles with candle-flicker LEDs to emulate tea-lights.</p>



<p>I was recently <a href="https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/482929">tipped off</a> to an upgraded variant that includes a timer that turns off the candle after it was active for 6h and turns it on again 18h later. E.g. when you turn it on at 7 pm on one day, it would stay active till 1 am and deactive itself until 7 pm on the next day. Seems quite useful, actually. The question is, how is it implemented? I bought a couple of these tea lights and took a closer look.</p>

<p>Nothing special on the outside. This is a typical LED tea light with CR2023 battery and a switch.</p>

<p>On the inside there is not much – a single 5mm LED and a black plastic part for the switch. Amazingly, the switch does now only move one of the LED legs so that it touches the battery. No additional metal parts required beyond the LED. As prevously, there is an IC  integrated together with a small LED die in the LED package.</p>

<p>Looking top down through the lens with a microscope we can see the dies from the top. What is curious about the IC is that it rather large, has plenty of unused pads (3 out of 8 used) and seems to have relatively small structures. There are rectangular regular areas that look like memory, there is a large area in the center with small random looking structure, looking like synthesized logic and some part that look like hand-crafted analog. Could this be a microcontroller?</p>



<p>Interestingly, also the positions of the used pads look quite familiar.</p>

<p>The pad-positions correspond exactly to that of the PIC12F508/9, VDD/VSS are bonded for the power supply and GP0 connects to the LED. This pinout has been adopted by the ubiqitous <a href="https://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2019/08/12/the-terrible-3-cent-mcu/">low-cost 8bit OTP controller</a>s that can be found in every cheap piece of chinese electronics nowadays.</p>



<p>Quite curious, so it appears that instead of designing another ASIC with candle flicker functionality and accurate 24h timer they simply used an OTP microcontroller and molded that into the LED. I am fairly certain that this is not an original microchip controller, but it likely is one of many PIC derivatives that  cost around a cent per die.</p>

<p>For some quick electrical characterization is connected the LED in series with a 220 Ohm resistor to measure the current transients. This allows for some insight into the internal operation. We can see that the LED is driven in PWM mode with a frequency of around 125Hz.  (left picture)</p>



<p>When synchronizing to the rising edge of the PWM signal we can see the current transients caused by the logic on the IC. Whenever a logic gate switches it will cause a small increase in current. We can see that similar patterns repeat at an interval of 1 µs. This suggests that the main clock of the MCU is 1 MHz. Each cycle looks slightly different, which is indicative of a program with varying instruction being executed.</p>



<h2>Sleep mode</h2>

<p>To gain more insights, I measured that LED after it was on for more than 6h and had entered sleep mode. Naturally, the PWM signal from the LED disappeared, but the current transients from the MCU remained the same, suggesting that it still operates at 1 MHz.</p>



<p>Integrating over the waveform allows to calculate the average current consumption. The average voltage was 53mV and thus the average current is 53mV/220Ohn=240µA.</p>



<h2>Can we improve on this?</h2>



<p>This is a rather high current consumption. Employing a MCU with sleep mode would allow to bring this down significiantly. For example the <a href="https://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2021/02/07/ultra-low-power-led-flasher/">PFS154 allows</a> for around 1µA idle current, the <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/attiny402">ATtiny402 even</a> a bit less.</p>



<p>Given a current consumption of 240µA, a CR2023 with a capacity of 220mAh would last around 220/0.240 = 915h or 38 days. </p>



<p>However, during the 6h it is active a current of several mA will be drawn from the battery. Assuming an average current of 2 mA, the battery woudl theoretically last 220mAh/3mA=73h. In reality, this high current draw <a href="https://www.dmcinfo.com/Portals/0/Blog%20Files/High%20pulse%20drain%20impact%20on%20CR2032%20coin%20cell%20battery%20capacity.pdf">will reduce its capacity significantly</a>. Assuming 150mAh usable capacity of a low cost battery, we end up  with around 50h of active operating time.</p>



<p>Now lets assume we can reduce the idle current consumption from 240µA to 2µA (18h of off time per day), while the active current consumption stays the same (mA for 6h):</p>



<p>a) Daily battery draw of current MCU: 6h*2mA + 18h*240µA = 16.3mAh<br>b) Optimzed MCU: 6h*2mA + 18h*2µA = 12mAh</p>



<p>Implementing a proper power down mode would therefore allows extending the operating life from 9.2 days to 12.5 days – quite a significant improvement. The main lever is the active consumption, though. </p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>In the year 2023, it appears that investing development costs in a candle-flicker ASIC is no longer the most economical option. Instead, ultra-inexpensive 8-bit OTP microcontrollers seem to be taking over low-cost electronics everywhere.</p>



<p>Is it possible to improve on this candle-LED implementation? It seems so, but this may be for another project.</p>

        <p>The McMurdo Dry Valleys, located in the Antarctic Victoria Land, are considered to be the most similar earthly equivalent to Mars. They make up one of the driest and most hostile environments on our planet, where strong winds scour away even snow and ice. Only so-called cryptoendolithic microorganisms, capable of surviving in cracks in rocks, and certain lichens can withstand such harsh climatological conditions.</p><p>A few years ago a team of European researchers travelled to these remote valleys to collect samples of two species of cryptoendolithic fungi: <em>Cryomyces antarcticus</em> and <em>Cryomyces minteri</em>. The aim was to send them to the International Space Station (ISS) for them to be subjected to Martian conditions and space to observe their responses.</p><p>The tiny fungi were placed in cells (1.4 centimetres in diameter) on a platform for experiments known as EXPOSE-E, developed by the European Space Agency to withstand extreme environments. The platform was sent in the Space Shuttle Atlantis to the ISS and placed outside the Columbus module with the help of an astronaut from the team led by Belgian Frank de Winne.</p><p>For 18 months half of the Antarctic fungi were exposed to Mars-like conditions. More specifically, this is an atmosphere with 95% CO<sub>2,</sub> 1.6% argon, 0.15% oxygen, 2.7% nitrogen and 370 parts per million of H<sub>2</sub>O; and a pressure of 1,000 pascals. Through optical filters, samples were subjected to ultra-violet radiation as if on Mars (higher than 200 nanometres) and others to lower radiation, including separate control samples.</p><p>“The most relevant outcome was that more than 60% of the cells of the endolithic communities studied remained intact after ‘exposure to Mars’, or rather, the stability of their cellular DNA was still high,” highlights Rosa de la Torre Noetzel from Spain’s National Institute of Aerospace Technology (INTA), co-researcher on the project.</p><div>

            </div>
            </div><p>The scientist explains that this work, published in the journal ‘<em>Astrobiology’</em>, forms part of an experiment known as the Lichens and Fungi Experiment (LIFE), “with which we have studied the fate or destiny of various communities of lithic organisms during a long-term voyage into space on the EXPOSE-E platform.”</p><p>“The results help to assess the survival ability and long-term stability of microorganisms and bioindicators on the surface of Mars, information which becomes fundamental and relevant for future experiments centred around the search for life on the red planet,” states De la Torre.</p><p><strong>Also lichens from Gredos and the Alps</strong></p><p>Researchers from the LIFE experiment, coordinated from Italy by Professor Silvano Onofri from the University of Tuscany, have also studied two species of lichens (<em>Rhizocarpon geographicum</em> and <em>Xanthoria elegans</em>) which can withstand extreme high-mountain environments. These have been gathered from the Sierra de Gredos (Avila, Spain) and the Alps (Austria), with half of the specimens also being exposed to Martian conditions.</p><p>Another range of samples (both lichens and fungi) was subjected to an extreme space environment (with temperature fluctuations of between -21.5 and +59.6 ºC, galactic-cosmic radiation of up to 190 megagrays, and a vacuum of between 10<sup>-7</sup> to 10<sup>-4</sup> pascals). The effect of the impact of ultra-violet extraterrestrial radiation on half of the samples was also examined.</p><p>After the year-and-a-half-long voyage, and the beginning of the experiment on Earth, the two species of lichens ‘exposed to Mars’ showed double the metabolic activity of those that had been subjected to space conditions, even reaching 80% more in the case of the species <em>Xanthoria elegans</em>.</p><p>The results showed subdued photosynthetic activity or viability in the lichens exposed to the harsh conditions of space (2.5% of samples), similar to that presented by the fungal cells (4.11%). In this space environment, 35% of fungal cells were also seen to have kept their membranes intact, a further sign of the resistance of Antarctic fungi.</p><div>

It came to be known as the “Bloody Third” due to its rough reputation, thanks in part to the high number of saloons and brawls.&nbsp;</p><p>After a massive fire in 1892 destroyed more than 400 buildings and left some 2,000 people homeless, Italian immigrants moved into the neighborhood.&nbsp;</p><p>Most, including my father’s family, came from Sicily. And many of them made a living in the produce business, selling fruits and vegetables – first from push carts, then horse-drawn wagons and eventually trucks. The Palmisano and Spicuzza families were among them.</p><p>Augie grew up helping at his father’s produce business in the heart of what was then known as Commission Row — a gritty stretch of Broadway that was packed with fruit and vegetable merchants.

I’ve been told so many Sicilian Americans attended Lincoln High that at one point plays were called from the sideline in Italian. It was the same school that Frank Balistrieri graduated from a decade earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1952, Augie married Jean Rose Lassa. They had four children together and bought a home for the family in Whitefish Bay. He worked second shift at American Motors while helping run the family produce company. After his father died in 1964, Augie took over the company, which by then was named Palmisano Produce.&nbsp;</p><p>In the years that followed, Augie started running the tavern adjacent to Palmisano Produce. It was called Richie’s on Broadway, but he eventually renamed it Palmy’s.</p><p>Augie’s side-by-side businesses – perched on the corner of North Broadway and East St. Paul Avenue – became a gateway of sorts to Commission Row.&nbsp;</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><media-image image-set="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/01/05/PLOU/72114623007-augie-bar-and-fruit.jpg bestCrop, https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/01/05/PLOU/72114623007-augie-bar-and-fruit.jpg?crop=2426,1819,x1125,y0 4:3, https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/01/05/PLOU/72114623007-augie-bar-and-fruit.jpg?crop=1365,1819,x2250,y0 3:4, https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/01/05/PLOU/72114623007-augie-bar-and-fruit.jpg?crop=3235,1819,x675,y0 16:9" image-alt="" credit="Provided" caption="A painting behind Augie’s bar portrayed him as the “King of Commission Row.” Palmisano standing next to a fruit display." orientation="horizontal" util-module-path="elements/media"></media-image><p>The tavern was especially popular with Commission Row’s produce workers.

Pistone said people scrambled to clear a table in a prime spot for Balistrieri and his entourage.&nbsp;</p><p>“It had to be a couple hundred people. Everything just stopped when they saw him. The maitre d’ came over and said, ‘Oh, Mr. Balistrieri, I didn't know you were coming,'" Pistone remembered. "It was like, you know, if you were in a foreign country, a president walking in. Or the queen walked in, I mean, you could see that that everybody knew who he was. And either they were terribly afraid of him or respected him."</p><p>“But he was the man," Pistone said. "He was the man in Milwaukee.”</p><p>Despite Pistone’s encyclopedic knowledge of the Mafia, he didn’t have a lot of answers when it came to Augie.</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><p>Pistone told me he doesn’t believe he ever met my cousin, but clearly remembers his murder – which he also wrote about in his book.&nbsp;</p><p>“He wasn’t a boss,” Pistone said. “I think he probably was involved in bookmaking operations.”</p><p>He did recall Balistrieri claiming that Augie was “a snitch.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Whether he was, I don't know,” Pistone said, adding that he made it a point not to know.</p><p>“It's human nature,” he said. “You’re going to act differently if you know that somebody, you know, is on your side.”</p><p>Pistone’s work in Milwaukee in 1978 would eventually help dismantle organized crime here.

Augie waited for three hours but Vince never showed up. Augie later found out that Vince had arrived in Milwaukee but immediately took a flight back to Hawaii.&nbsp;Denton told police that Augie was very upset and frightened, and thought Vince may have been threatened when he arrived at the airport.</p><p>Then, a month before the murder, Vince again called Augie and told him that he was having trouble finding a job, and wanted to come home to Milwaukee.</p><p>“It’s better for you to stay where you are, and I’ll stay where I am.

It’s people doing things that could kill innocent people easily.”</p><p>When I asked if he thought Balistrieri got away with murder, Franke fell silent.&nbsp;</p><p>“The most compelling statement from Frank was not recorded,” he said after a long pause. “That would be ‘they can't find his skin.

Because I'm sure if we thought that was enough, we would have pursued it. But, proving beyond a reasonable doubt that he ordered it just because he was gloating about someone's death,” Franke said. “I don't know. Maybe we missed something.

He did everything he could to get them to do his dirty work.”</p><p>FBI documents corroborate that there was bad blood between the two, including a July 1978 report stating that Augie had “openly showed his disgust with Balistrieri for having a bomb placed in Vincent Maniaci’s vehicle.”&nbsp;</p><p>The report also said that Balistrieri had previously accused Augie of operating a bookmaking business without paying off “the LCN,” or La Cosa Nostra.</p><partner-banner util-module-path="elements/partner" fluid="" bottom="" lazy="" min-height="390" outstream=""></partner-banner><p>Family history suggests the bad blood may have started years earlier, when Augie’s brother married Balistrieri’s sister, against the Palmisano family's wishes.

        <p>
  New research on the effect of AI-powered GitHub Copilot on software development cites some adverse results.
  
</p>



<p>
  The "<a href="https://www.gitclear.com/coding_on_copilot_data_shows_ais_downward_pressure_on_code_quality" target="_blank">Coding on Copilot</a>" whitepaper from GitClear sought to investigate the quality and maintainability of AI-assisted code compared to what would have been written by a human. In other words: "Is it more similar to the careful, refined contributions of a Senior Developer, or more akin to the disjointed work of a short-term contractor?" 
  
</p>



<p>
  The answer to that is summarized in this paragraph from the whitepaper's abstract:
  
</p>



<blockquote>
  <i>
    "We find disconcerting trends for maintainability. Code churn -- the percentage of lines that are reverted or updated less than two weeks after being authored -- is projected to double in 2024 compared to its 2021, pre-AI baseline. We further find that the percentage of 'added code' and 'copy/pasted code' is increasing in proportion to 'updated,' 'deleted,' and 'moved 'code. In this regard, AI-generated code resembles an itinerant contributor, prone to violate the DRY-ness [don't repeat yourself] of the repos visited."
    
  </i>
</blockquote>




<p>
  That serves as a counterpoint to findings of some other studies, including <a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2022/09/13/copilot-impact.aspx" target="_blank">one from GitHub in 2022</a> that found, for one thing: "developers who used GitHub Copilot completed the task significantly faster -- 55 percent faster than the developers who didn't use GitHub Copilot." That study was noted in the new whitepaper from GitClear, which sells a cloud-based code review tool. In addition to productivity, the GitHub study also measured positive effects in developer satisfaction and conserving mental energy.
  
</p>



<p>
  GitClear's research, however, investigated "how the composition of code changes when AI is used." GitClear said its report sheds light on:
  
</p>



<ul>
<li>What are the three significant changes since Copilot's introduction?
</li>
<li>What do Technical Leaders need to be on the lookout for 2024?
</li>
<li>How can you measure the impact of AI on your team's code quality?</li>
</ul>

    





<p>
  Regarding that first item, the paper indicated the three most significant changes associated with Copilot's rise concerned "Churn"  and "Moved" and "Copy/Pasted" code:
  
</p>



<ul>
<li><b>Burgeoning Churn: </b> "The bottom line is that 'using Copilot' is strongly correlated with 'mistake code' being pushed to the repo."

<figcaption> <b>[Click on image for larger view.]</b> Code Churn by Year <em>(source: GitClear).</em></figcaption>
</figure></div>

</li>
<li><b>Less Moved Code Implies Less Refactoring, Less Reuse:</b> "Combined with the growth in code labeled 'Copy/Pasted,' there is little room to doubt that the current implementation of AI Assistants discourages code reuse. Instead of refactoring and working to DRY ('Don't Repeat Yourself') code, these Assistants offer a one-keystroke temptation to repeat existing code."
</li>
<li><b>More Copy/Pasted Code Implies Future Headaches:</b> "There is perhaps no greater scourge to long-term code maintainability than copy/pasted code. In effect, when a non-keyword line of code is repeated, the code author is admitting 'I didn't have the time to evaluate the previous implementation.' By re-adding code instead of reusing it, the chore is left to future maintainers to figure out how to consolidate parallel code paths that implement repeatedly-needed functionality."</li>
</ul>




<p>
  The paper concludes: "How will Copilot transform what it means to be a developer? There's no question that, as AI has surged in popularity, we have entered an era where code lines are being added faster than ever before. The better question for 2024: who's on the hook to clean up the mess afterward?"
  
</p>



<p>
   Some other studies on the topic include:
  
</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2209.01766v2" target="_blank">"Exploring the Verifiability of Code Generated by GitHub Copilot</a>: "We found evidence which corroborates the current consensus in the literature: Copilot is a powerful tool; however, it should not be 'flying the plane' by itself."
</li>
<li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3558489.3559072" target="_blank">"Assessing the Quality of GitHub Copilot's Code Generation</a>: "Our empirical analysis shows that GitHub Copilot is a promising tool based on the results we obtained, however further and more comprehensive assessment is needed in the future."</li>

<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15033" target="_blank">Sea Change in Software Development: Economic and Productivity Analysis of the AI-Powered Developer Lifecycle</a>: "As more developers embrace these tools and acquire proficiency in the art of prompting with generative AI, it becomes evident that this novel approach to software development has forged a unique inextricable link between humans and artificial intelligence. This symbiotic relationship has the potential to shape the construction of the world's software for future generations."</li>

<li>
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.06590.pdf" target="_blank">The Impact of AI on Developer Productivity: Evidence from GitHub Copilot</a>: "Observed heterogenous effects show promise for AI
  pair programmers to help people transition into software development careers."
</li>

<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.04991.pdf" target="_blank">Study of software developers' experience using the Github Copilot Tool in the software development process</a>: "The results of the research indicate that developers' opinions are divided. Most of them met Github Copilot before attending the survey. The attitude to the tool was mostly positive but not many participants were willing to use it. Concerns are caused by security issues associated with using of Github Copilot."</li>

</ul>




<p>
  For its study, GitClear collected and analyzed 153 million changed lines of code, authored between January 2020 and December 2023.
