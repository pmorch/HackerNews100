<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>We need to have a serious chat about iPhone repairability. We judged the phones of yesteryear by how easy they were to take apart—screws, glues, how hard it was to change a battery. But repairs have gotten trickier, by design. Software now limits many basic iPhone repairs. That’s why we’ve revised the repairability score for the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/iPhone_14">iPhone 14</a> from a <em>recommend </em>7 out of 10 to a <em>do-not-recommend</em> 4.</p>



<p>Although we <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/64865/iphone-14-teardown">enthusiastically</a> awarded it a solid score at launch last year, thanks to its innovative repair-friendly architecture—of which we remain big fans—the reality for folks trying to fix these things has been very different. Most major repairs on modern iPhones require Apple approval. You have to buy parts through their system, then have the repair validated via a chat system. Otherwise, you’ll run into limited or missing functionality, with a side of annoying warnings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lots of independent repair shops have business models that are threatened by Apple’s <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/69320/how-parts-pairing-kills-independent-repair">parts pairing</a> practice. Shops harvest parts from broken devices. They use third-party parts. They shouldn’t have to send Apple their customers’ personal information, or agree to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjdjnv/apples-independent-repair-program-is-invasive-to-shops-and-their-customers-contract-shows">five years of audits</a> just to do the repairs they know how to do.</p>



<p>So when we gave the iPhone 14 a high score, the community <a href="https://youtu.be/K2WhU77ihw8?si=TEeGyQscV2wHr3xQ&amp;t=887">pushed back</a>. To be honest, they were right—and we’d like to thank our critics for helping us hold manufacturers accountable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The situation has gotten so bad that several repair professionals have told us they’re leaving the business entirely rather than navigate the labyrinthine maze of obstacles that Apple has erected.</p>



<p>So we’ve gone back to the drawing board with our scoring system to make sure that it reflects this significant new software limitation on repairs. And now that we’ve run the iPhone 14 through our new scorecard, the picture isn’t as rosy. The iPhone 14’s new 4 / 10 score reflects the fact that individuals and independent repair shops encounter some atrocious limitations when trying to fix it.</p>



<h2><strong>It’s Literally Not Re-Pairable</strong></h2>



<p>For many years, iFixit scores were primarily about <em>design for repair</em>—that is, how easy (or difficult) it is to disassemble your gadget, replace whatever’s broken, and reassemble it successfully. The highest scores were <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/55818/fairphone-4-teardown-if-only-apple-made-phones-like-this">reserved</a> for devices whose manufacturers even provided instructions for how to do that.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="592" height="444" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18221601/lightning.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Ever the innovators, Apple introduced a new dimension to repair that our scorecard simply didn’t account for: namely, that you could take a highly repairable design like the iPhone 14, install a <em>genuine</em> Apple replacement screen or battery, and then… it fails to work. Following the correct procedure was no longer enough.</p>



<p>Today, you need one more thing: a software handshake, using Apple’s System Configuration tool. It contacts Apple’s servers to “authenticate” the repair, then “pairs” the new part to your system so it works as expected. Of course, it can only authenticate if Apple knows about your repair in advance, because you gave them the exact serial number of your iPhone, and they’ve pre-matched it to a display or battery. This is only possible if you buy the screen or battery directly from Apple. Forget harvesting parts—which is a huge part of most independent repair and recycling businesses. It’s also impossible to pair any aftermarket parts—which means only Apple-authorized repairs can truly restore the device to full functionality.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="932" height="648" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18221611/messages.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Apple’s numerous ‘genuine’ parts warnings appear for all parts, even brand new OEM parts, that have not been blessed by Apple’s authentication process.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While it’s an improvement over the status quo of just a few years ago, when Apple wouldn’t sell parts or supply instructions or software tools to <em>anyone</em> outside the Genius Bar and a few select “authorized” repair outlets, it’s still a major problem. Apple has made some real progress here—and we’ve been reluctant to criticize manufacturers taking meaningful steps. There are good people inside Apple working hard to make this situation better.</p>



<p>But parts pairing is a serious threat to our ability to fix the things we own. The problem is the invasive amount of control that Apple exerts over this entire process, and the fee they require you to pay for the privilege of fixing your own stuff. Apple likes to control the user experience so they can make it flawless—and we get that—but that experience should never come at the expense of our ownership rights or the planet. Already got a genuine screen or battery handy? Too bad—you’ll have to buy a new one from Apple if you want full functionality. And what happens in a few years when Apple stops officially supporting repairs for your device and shuts off the authentication servers? Apple’s message is loud and clear: user repair isn’t a priority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our reporting, and this revised scoring system, is the result of painstaking analysis. Our team has purchased several units of each phone generation and model and performed hundreds of <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/66879/iphone-14-parts-pairing-results-apple-is-still-trying-to-monopolise-repair">tests swapping individual parts</a>. The parts pairing problems we’ve reported on have been backed up by field reports from independent repair shops and YouTube repairers like Hugh Jeffreys and Louis Rossmann.</p>



<h2><strong>How Did We Get Here?</strong></h2>



<p>In a move that will not surprise close observers of Apple, they have developed the system without notifying the people who do the actual repair work that it impacts.</p>



<p>The shifting, secretive target has made it difficult to incorporate into our repairability scoring system. The first paired part we encountered was the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+5s+Teardown/17383#s52330">iPhone 5s</a> biometric fingerprint sensor. Seemingly, this was a necessity for security—so while our forums <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/482732/Getting+around+TouchID+pairing">filled up</a> with users whose repairs were stymied, we didn’t modify our score.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then a curious thing happened: <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPhone+XS+Screen+Replacement/113862">True Tone started disappearing</a> after screen repairs, even with genuine screens. Then some aftermarket screens <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/59jwvz/iphone-8-aftermarket-touchscreens-ios-update">stopped working</a>. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/9917/11-3-update-breaking-iphone-screens">Some of these bugs</a> were fixed, some were not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/11208/batterygate-timeline">fury of Batterygate</a>, when the world learned that Apple was slowing down phones with older batteries, the company doubled down and <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/32343/apple-is-locking-batteries-to-iphones-now">started locking batteries</a> to the logic board via an iOS update. The update hid battery health from the owner of the device with third party batteries, removing a critical lifespan management feature.</p>



<p>Around the same time, the iPhone X introduced Face ID, a revolutionary technology with an unfortunately paired dot projector. As with the biometric sensor, we assumed this was a security issue and, while we didn’t like it, we justified Apple’s behavior because moving to new technology often comes with compromises. So we reluctantly made a carveout in our scoring system for security—but this just as quickly became a slippery slope.</p>



<p>Sometimes parts just didn’t work. But just as often, parts swaps prompted pop-ups. Warnings, warnings, and more warnings. Apple started pushing warnings when repairs were performed—and they were <em>pesky.&nbsp;</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1783" height="850" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18223502/image-4.png" alt="iPhone battery warnings" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18223502/image-4.png 1783w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18223502/image-4-1536x732.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1783px) 100vw, 1783px"></figure>



<p>iPhone 12 came with a camera fail, warnings, and the resultant disappointment to the repair community. iPhone 13 came with a sensibly redesigned display to make Face ID less of an issue with repairs—except that it <em>disabled Face ID completely </em>when replaced<em>. </em>The emotional yo-yo (<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/56386/ios-15-2-fixes-iphone-13s-face-id-repair-trap-and-improves-its-repair-score">and repairability score yo-yo</a>) left us reeling. Steps forward, steps back. All the while, though, the steady drumbeat of parts pairing got louder. What initially started as isolated security quirks and bugs ended up being the first canaries in a dark coal mine of pairing strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One by one, the glitches and bugs add up to a broad strategy, a systematic plan to require Apple’s permission to perform any repair on the iPhone.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><a href="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18222059/image.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="3238" height="745" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18222059/image.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18222059/image.jpg 3238w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18222059/image-1536x353.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/09/18222059/image-2048x471.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 3238px) 100vw, 3238px"></a></figure>



<h2><strong>The iPhone 14 is Still a Mechanical Design Triumph</strong></h2>



<p>We maintain our high praise for the iPhone 14’s hardware architecture, which really does move the needle on repairability. Rear glass repairs that cost as much as $549 on the previous architecture now costs just $169 with the new mid-frame design.</p>



<p>Discussing repairability <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ZiP1l7jlIIA?si=HPONgHjuCmE0-q65&amp;t=3526">for the first time</a> in the iPhone 15 announcement, Apple said they were expanding this new architecture to all 15 models. (On the iPhone 14, only the base, non-Pro models featured the improved design.)</p>



<p>Bravo! This design is truly an improvement worthy of the marketing effort. This is a very good hardware design, and we hope other OEMs will take notice and learn from it.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this laudable mechanical improvement is undermined by a raft of software obstacles.</p>



<h2><strong>Apple Has Not Responded to Feedback</strong></h2>



<p>This parts pairing problem is by <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/nixing-fix-ftc-report-congress-repair-restrictions/nixing_the_fix_report_final_5521_630pm-508_002.pdf">no means isolated</a> to iPhones. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/71442/tearing-down-the-14-macbook-pro-with-apples-help">MacBooks</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/apple-pencils-cant-draw-straight-on-third-party-replacement-ipad-screens/">iPads</a> are suffering a similar fate, with screens, buttons, and other important components slowly sliding further into the realm of “only repairable by Apple—or with tough compromises.”</p>



<p>Even though we and <a href="https://repair.eu/news/we-need-the-right-to-repair-to-be-universal/">other repair advocates</a> have been sounding the alarm on parts pairing for years, Apple’s response has been lacking—especially for an industry leader and trend-setter with resources to act responsibly—and the problem continues to worsen. There may be multiple reasons for that, not all of them nefarious:</p>



<ul><li>Benign neglect</li><li>Precision parts calibration</li><li>Combating warranty fraud</li><li>Lack of testing software updates with aftermarket parts</li><li>Control over the customer experience</li></ul>



<p>Our intel says that it’s likely a combination of all of the above. Regardless: Apple has the resources to solve these problems. Based on how Apple designs their products and the relentless, unparallelled focus on user experience, they could easily be a leader in creating the best self-repair experience in tech. Yet, we don’t see that. Year after year, our scrappy repair community shouldn’t have to keep innovating around the shortcomings of the world’s most valuable company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apple needs to do better. And frankly, so do we—so as of today, our repairability scores do a better job of reflecting reality.</p>



<h2><strong>A New Score</strong></h2>



<p>The new <strong>4 / 10</strong> score lands just on the negative side of our scorecard, and garners a reluctant but clear <em>not recommended</em>. Our new scorecard covers a wide gamut of approaches that Apple has taught us about, and includes penalties for almost-repairs, non-repairs, and “genuineness” warnings. Taken together, these deductions erode the overall score of the device significantly. (Updating the scorecard took us many months of careful work—if you’re curious about how we score, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/75533/how-ifixit-scores-repairability">check out this explainer</a>.) This scorecard will be the standard for all products moving forward—as Apple isn’t the only company utilizing parts pairing and other digital locks to handcuff DIY repairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This repairability score doesn’t just represent our recommendations. It encapsulates countless wasted money, time, and tears of frustration on the part of Apple customers, repair techs, and would-be repairers. It represents a rising tide of e-waste that threatens the well-being of our society and our planet.</p>



<p>You can help, by preferring repairable products wherever possible. Product designers are paying attention. If enough consumers demand repairable products, then companies will create longer lasting products.</p>



<p>One note: for now, we are only rescoring the iPhone 14. We are not retroactively rescoring <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/repairability/smartphone-scores">earlier iPhones</a> at this time. If we did, their scores would also likely decline.</p>



<p>Apple could fix this problem with a software update, and that 7 / 10 score could return overnight. Even though they recently signaled their <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/79902/apples-u-turn-tech-giant-finally-backs-repair-in-california">support for Right to Repair in California</a>, these problems show that they are not taking the situation seriously enough.</p>



<p>We’re going to keep working to hold Apple and other manufacturers accountable the best way we know: By speaking the truth about <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/nixing-fix-ftc-report-congress-repair-restrictions/nixing_the_fix_report_final_5521_630pm-508_002.pdf">repair restrictions</a> as loudly as we can, by revising our scorecard to reflect any new obstacles to repair, and by pushing for Right to Repair laws that ban parts pairing.</p>



<p>Long-lasting, repairable products are essential for the future of the planet. Sustainable electronics stand the test of time, and parts pairing undermines the ecosystem needed to keep these devices alive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right to repair is gaining momentum. We’re not giving up the fight for independent repair—and <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair">neither should you</a>.&nbsp;</p>

</figure><p>How many clinical-trial studies in medical journals are fake or fatally flawed? In October 2020, John Carlisle reported a startling estimate<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><p>Carlisle, an anaesthetist who works for England’s National Health Service, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02241-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02241-z" data-track-category="body text link">renowned for his ability to spot dodgy data in medical trials</a>. He is also an editor at the journal <i>Anaesthesia</i>, and in 2017, he decided to scour all the manuscripts he handled that reported a randomized controlled trial (RCT) — the gold standard of medical research. Over three years, he scrutinized more than 500 studies<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><p>For more than 150 trials, Carlisle got access to anonymized individual participant data (IPD). By studying the IPD spreadsheets, he judged that 44% of these trials contained at least some flawed data: impossible statistics, incorrect calculations or duplicated numbers or figures, for instance. And in 26% of the papers had problems that were so widespread that the trial was impossible to trust, he judged — either because the authors were incompetent, or because they had faked the data.</p><p>Carlisle called these ‘zombie’ trials because they had the semblance of real research, but closer scrutiny showed they were actually hollow shells, masquerading as reliable information. Even he was surprised by their prevalence. “I anticipated maybe one in ten,” he says.</p><p>When Carlisle couldn’t access a trial’s raw data, however, he could study only the aggregated information in the summary tables. Just 1% of these cases were zombies, and 2% had flawed data, he judged (see ‘The prevalence of ‘zombie’ trials’). This finding alarmed him, too: it suggested that, without access to the IPD — which journal editors usually don’t request and reviewers don’t see — even an experienced sleuth cannot spot hidden flaws.</p><figure>

</figure><p>“I think journals should assume that all submitted papers are potentially flawed and editors should review individual patient data before publishing randomised controlled trials,” Carlisle wrote in his report.</p><p>Carlisle rejected every zombie trial, but by now, almost three years later, most have been published in other journals — sometimes with different data to those submitted with the manuscript he had seen. He is writing to journal editors to alert them, but expects that little will be done.</p><p>Do Carlisle’s findings in anaesthesiology extend to other fields? For years, a number of scientists, physicians and data sleuths have argued that fake or unreliable trials are frighteningly widespread. They’ve scoured RCTs in various medical fields, such as women’s health, pain research, anaesthesiology, bone health and COVID-19, and have found dozens or hundreds of trials with seemingly statistically impossible data. Some, on the basis of their personal experiences, say that one-quarter of trials being untrustworthy might be an underestimate. “If you search for all randomized trials on a topic, about a third of the trials will be fabricated,” asserts Ian Roberts, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine.</p><p>The issue is, in part, a subset of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00733-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00733-5" data-track-category="body text link">notorious paper-mill problem</a>: over the past decade, journals in many fields have published tens of thousands of suspected fake papers, some of which are thought to have been produced by third-party firms, termed paper mills.</p><p>But faked or unreliable RCTs are a particularly dangerous threat. They not only are about medical interventions, but also can be laundered into respectability by being included in meta-analyses and systematic reviews, which thoroughly comb the literature to assess evidence for clinical treatments. Medical guidelines often cite such assessments, and physicians look to them when deciding how to treat patients.</p><p>Ben Mol, who specializes in obstetrics and gynaecology at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, argues that as many as 20–30% of the RCTs included in systematic reviews in women’s health are suspect.</p><p>Many research-integrity specialists say that the problem exists, but its extent and impact are unclear. Some doubt whether the issue is as bad as the most alarming examples suggest. “We have to recognize that, in the field of high-quality evidence, we increasingly have a lot of noise. There are some good people championing that and producing really scary statistics. But there are also a lot in the academic community who think this is scaremongering,” says Žarko Alfirević, a specialist in fetal and maternal medicine at the University of Liverpool, UK.</p><p>This year, he and others are conducting more studies to assess how bad the problem is. Initial results from a study led by Alfirević are not encouraging.</p><h2><b>Laundering fake trials</b></h2><p>Medical research has always had fraudsters. Roberts, for instance, first came across the issue when he co-authored a 2005 systematic review for the Cochrane Collaboration, a prestigious group whose reviews of medical research evidence are often used to shape clinical practice. The review suggested that high doses of a sugary solution could reduce death after head injury. But Roberts retracted it<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup> after doubts arose about three of the key trials cited in the paper, all authored by the same Brazilian neurosurgeon, Julio Cruz. (Roberts never discovered whether the trials were fake, because Cruz died by suicide before investigations began. Cruz’s articles have not been retracted.)</p><p>A more recent example is that of Yoshihiro Sato, a Japanese bone-health researcher. Sato, who died in 2016, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01884-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01884-2" data-track-category="body text link">fabricated data in dozens of trials of drugs or supplements that might prevent bone fracture</a>. He has 113 retracted papers, according to a list compiled by the website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://retractionwatch.com/" data-track="click" data-label="https://retractionwatch.com/" data-track-category="body text link">Retraction Watch</a>. His work has had a wide impact: researchers found that 27 of Sato’s retracted RCTs had been cited by 88 systematic reviews and clinical guidelines, some of which had informed Japan’s recommended treatments for osteoporosis<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>.</p><p>Some of the findings in about half of these reviews would have changed had Sato’s trials been excluded, says Alison Avenell, a medical researcher at the University of Aberdeen, UK. She, along with medical researchers Andrew Grey, Mark Bolland and Greg Gamble, all at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, have pushed universities to investigate Sato’s work and monitored its influence. “It probably diverted people from being given more effective treatment for fracture prevention,” Avenell says.</p><figure>

</figure><p>The concerns over zombie trials, however, are beyond individual fakers flying under the radar. In some fields, swathes of RCTs from different research groups might be unreliable, researchers worry.</p><p>During the pandemic, for instance, a flurry of RCTs was conducted into whether ivermectin, an anti-parasite drug, could treat COVID-19. But researchers who were not involved have since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01535-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01535-y" data-track-category="body text link">pointed out data flaws</a> in many of the studies, some of which have been retracted. A 2022 update of a Cochrane review argued that more than 40% of these RCTs were untrustworthy<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>.</p><p>“Untrustworthy work must be removed from systematic reviews,” says Stephanie Weibel, a biologist at the University of Wuerzberg in Germany, who co-authored the review.</p><p>In maternal health — another field seemingly rife with problems — Roberts and Mol have flagged studies into whether a drug called tranexamic acid can stem dangerously heavy bleeding after childbirth. Every year, around 14 million people experience this condition, and some 70,000 die: it is the world’s leading cause of maternal death.</p><p>In 2016, Roberts reviewed evidence for using tranexamic acid to treat serious blood loss after childbirth. He reported that many of the 26 RCTs investigating the drug had serious flaws. Some had identical text, others had data inconsistencies or no records of ethical approval. Some seemed not to have adequately randomized the assignment of their participants to control and treatment groups<sup><a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">5</a></sup>.</p><p>When he followed up with individual authors to ask for more details and raw data, he generally got no response or was told that records were missing or had been lost because of computer theft. Fortunately, in 2017, a large, high-quality multi-centre trial, which Roberts helped to run, established that the drug was effective<sup><a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">6</a></sup>. It’s likely, says Roberts, that in these and other such cases, some of the dubious trials were copycat fraud — researchers saw that a large trial was going on and produced small, substandard copies that no one would question. This kind of fraud isn’t a victimless crime, however. “It results in narrowed confidence intervals such that the results look much more certain than they are. It also has the potential to amplify a wrong result, suggesting that treatments work when they don’t,” he says.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>That might have happened for another question: what if doctors were to inject the drug into everyone undergoing a caesarean, just after they give birth, as a preventative measure? A 2021 review<sup><a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">7</a></sup> of 36 RCTs investigating this idea, involving a total of more than 10,000 participants, concluded that this would reduce the risk of heavy blood loss by 60%.</p><p>Yet this April, an enormous US-led RCT with 11,000 people reported only a slight and not statistically significant benefit<sup><a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">8</a></sup>.</p><p>Mol thinks problems with some of the 36 previous RCTs explains the discrepancy. The 2021 meta-analysis had included one multi-centre study in France of more than 4,000 participants, which found a modest 16% reduction in severe blood loss, and another 35 smaller, single-centre studies, mostly conducted in India, Iran, Egypt and China, which collectively estimated a 93% drop. Many of the smaller RCTs were untrustworthy, says Mol, who has dug into some of them in detail.</p><p>It’s unclear whether the untrustworthy studies affected clinical practice. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using tranexamic acid to treat blood loss after childbirth, but it doesn’t have a guideline on preventive administration.</p><h2><b>From four trials to one</b></h2><p>Mol points to a different example in which untrustworthy trials might have influenced clinical practice. In 2018, researchers published a Cochrane review<sup><a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">9</a></sup> on whether giving steroids to people due to undergo caesarean-section births helped to reduce breathing problems in their babies. Steroids are good for a baby’s lungs but can harm the developing brain, says Mol; benefits generally outweigh harms when babies are born prematurely, but the balance is less clear when steroids are used later in pregnancy.</p><p>The authors of the 2018 review, led by Alexandros Sotiriadis, a specialist in maternal–fetal medicine at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece, analysed the evidence for administering steroids to people delivering by caesarean later in pregnancy. They ended up with four RCTs: a British study from 2005 with more than 940 participants, and three Egyptian trials conducted between 2015 and 2018 that added another 3,000 people into the evidence base. The review concluded that the steroids “may” reduce rates of breathing problems; it was cited in more than 200 documents and some clinical guidelines.</p><p>In January 2021, however, Mol and others, who had looked in more depth into the papers, raised concerns about the Egyptian trials. The largest study, with nearly 1,300 participants, was based on the second author’s thesis, he noted — but the trial end dates in the thesis differed from the paper. And the reported ratio of male to female babies was an impossible 40% to 60%. Mol queried the other papers, too, and wrote to the authors, but says he did not get satisfactory replies. (One author told him he’d lost the data when moving house.) Mol’s team also reported statistical issues with some other works by the same authors.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>In December 2021, Sotiriadis’s team updated its review<sup><a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">10</a></sup>. But this time, it adopted a new screening protocol. Until that year, Cochrane reviews had aimed to include all relevant RCTs; if researchers spotted potential issues with a trial, using a ‘risk of bias’ checklist, they would downgrade their confidence in its findings, but not remove it from their analysis. But in 2021, Cochrane’s research-integrity team introduced new guidance: authors should try to identify ‘problematic’ or ‘untrustworthy’ trials and exclude them from reviews. Sotiriadis’s group now excluded all but the British research. With only one trial left, there was “insufficient data” to draw firm conclusions about the steroids, the researchers said.</p><p>By last May, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/08/journal-retracts-c-section-paper-with-impossible-data" data-track="click" data-label="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/08/journal-retracts-c-section-paper-with-impossible-data" data-track-category="body text link">as Retraction Watch reported</a>, the large Egyptian trial was retracted (to the disagreement of its authors). The journal’s editors wrote in the retraction notice that they had not received its data or a satisfactory response from the authors, adding that “if the data is unreliable, women and babies are being harmed”. The other two trials are still under investigation by publisher Taylor &amp; Francis as part of a larger case of papers, says Sabina Alam, director of publishing ethics at the firm. Before the 2018 review, some clinical guidelines had suggested that administering steroids later in pregnancy could be beneficial, and the practice had been growing in some countries, such as Australia, Mol has reported. The latest updated WHO and regional guidelines, however, recommend against this practice.</p><p>Overall, Mol and his colleagues have alleged problems in more than 800 published medical research papers, at least 500 of which are on RCTs. So far, the work has led to more than 80 retractions and 50 expressions of concern. Mol has focused much of his work on papers from countries in the Middle East, and particularly in Egypt. One researcher responded to some of his e-mails by accusing him of racism. Mol, however, says that it’s simply a fact that he has encountered many suspect statistics and refusals to share data from RCT authors in countries such as Iran, Egypt, Turkey and China — and that he should be able to point that out.</p><h2><b>Screening for trustworthiness</b></h2><p>“Ben Mol has undoubtedly been a pioneer in the field of detecting and fighting data falsification,” says Sotiriadis — but he adds that it is difficult to prove that a paper is falsified. Sotiriadis says he didn’t depend on Mol’s work when his team excluded those trials in its update, and he can’t say whether the trials were corrupt.</p><p>Instead, his group followed a screening protocol designed to check for ‘trustworthiness’. It had been developed by one of Cochrane’s independent specialist groups, the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth (CPC) group, coordinated by Alfirević. (This April, Cochrane formally dissolved this group and some others, as part of a reorganization strategy.) It provides a detailed list of criteria that authors should follow to check the trustworthiness of an RCT — such as whether a trial is prospectively registered and whether the study is free of unusual statistics, such as implausibly narrow or wide distributions of mean values in participant height, weight or other characteristics, and other red flags. If RCTs fail the checks, then reviewers are instructed to contact the original study authors — and, if the replies are not adequate, to exclude the study.</p><p>“We’re championing the idea that, if a study doesn’t pass these bars, then no hard feelings, but we don’t call it trustworthy enough,” Alfirević explains.</p><p>For Sotiriadis, the merit of this protocol was that it avoided his having to declare the trials faulty or fraudulent; they had merely failed a test of trustworthiness. His team ultimately reported that it excluded the Egyptian trials because they hadn’t been prospectively registered and the authors didn’t explain why.</p><p>Other Cochrane authors are starting to adopt the same protocol. For instance, a review<sup><a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">11</a></sup> of drugs aiming to prevent pre-term labour, published last August, used it to exclude 44 studies — one-quarter of the 122 trials in the literature.</p><h2><b>What counts as trustworthy?</b></h2><p>Whether trustworthiness checks are sometimes unfair to the authors of RCTs, and exactly what should be checked to classify untrustworthy research, is still up for debate. In a 2021 editorial<sup><a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">12</a></sup> introducing the idea of trustworthiness screening, Lisa Bero, a senior research integrity editor at Cochrane, and a bioethicist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, pointed out that there was no validated, universally agreed method.</p><p>“Misclassification of a genuine study as problematic could result in erroneous review conclusions. Misclassification could also lead to reputational damage to authors, legal consequences, and ethical issues associated with participants having taken part in research, only for it to be discounted,” she and two other researchers wrote.</p><p>For now, there are multiple trustworthiness protocols in play. In 2020, for instance, Avenell and others <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03959-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03959-6" data-track-category="body text link">published REAPPRAISED</a>, a checklist aimed more at journal editors. And when Weibel and others reviewed trials investigating ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment last year, they created their own checklist, which they call a ‘research integrity assessment’.</p><p>Bero says some of these checks are more labour-intensive than editors and systematic reviewers are generally accustomed to. “We need to convince systematic reviewers that this is worth their time,” she says. She and others have consulted biomedical researchers, publishers and research-integrity experts to come up with a set of red flags that might serve as the basis for creating a widely agreed method of assessment.</p><p>Despite the concerns of researchers such as Mol, many scientists remain unsure how many reviews have been compromised by unreliable RCTs. This year, a team led by Jack Wilkinson, a health researcher at the University of Manchester, UK, is using the results of Bero’s consultation to apply a list of 76 trustworthiness checks to all trials cited in 50 published Cochrane reviews. (The 76 items include detailed examination of the data and statistics in trials, as well as inspecting details on funding, grants, trial registration, the plausibility of study methods and authors’ publication records — but, in this exercise, data from individual participants are not being requested.)</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The aim is to see how many RCTs fail the checks, and what impact removing those trials would have on the reviews’ conclusions. Wilkinson says a team of 50 is working on the project. He aims to produce a general trustworthiness-screening tool, as well as a separate tool to aid in inspecting participant data, if authors provide them. He will discuss the work in September at Cochrane’s annual colloquium.</p><p>Alfirević’s team, meanwhile, has found in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://events.cochrane.org/colloquium-2023/session/1473810/assessment-of-trustworthiness-has-a-significant-impact-on-conclusions-of-cochrane-reviews" data-track="click" data-label="https://events.cochrane.org/colloquium-2023/session/1473810/assessment-of-trustworthiness-has-a-significant-impact-on-conclusions-of-cochrane-reviews" data-track-category="body text link">a study yet to be published</a> that 25% of around 350 RCTs in 18 Cochrane reviews on nutrition and pregnancy would have failed trustworthiness checks, using the CPC’s method. With these RCTs excluded, the team found that one-third of the reviews would require updating because their findings would have changed. The researchers will report more details in September.</p><p>In Alfirević’s view, it doesn’t particularly matter which trustworthiness checks reviewers use, as long as they do something to scrutinize RCTs more closely. He warns that the numbers of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that journals publish have themselves been soaring in the past decade — and many of these reviews can’t be trusted because of shoddy screening methods. “An untrustworthy systematic review is far more dangerous than an untrustworthy primary study,” he says. “It is an industry that is completely out of hand, with little quality assurance.”</p><p>Roberts, who first published in 2015 his concerns over problematic medical research in systematic reviews<sup><a href="#ref-CR13" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">13</a></sup>, says that the Cochrane organization took six years to respond and still isn’t taking the issue seriously enough. “If up to 25% of trials included in systematic reviews are fraudulent, then the whole Cochrane endeavour is suspect. Much of what we think we know based on systematic reviews is wrong,” he says.</p><p>Bero says that Cochrane consulted widely to develop its 2021 guide on addressing problematic trials, including incorporating suggestions from Roberts, other Cochrane reviewers and research-integrity experts.</p><h2><b>Asking for data</b></h2><p>Many researchers worried by medical fakery agree with Carlisle that it would help if journals routinely asked authors to share their IPD. “Asking for raw data would be a good policy. The default position has just been to trust the study, but we’ve been operating from quite a naive position,” says Wilkinson. That advice, however, runs counter to current practice at most medical journals.</p><p>In 2016, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), an influential body that sets policy for many major medical titles, had proposed requiring mandatory data-sharing from RCTs. But it got pushback — including over perceived risks to the privacy of trial participants who might not have consented to their data being shared, and the availability of resources for archiving the data. As a result, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.icmje.org/news-and-editorials/data_sharing_june_2017.pdf" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.icmje.org/news-and-editorials/data_sharing_june_2017.pdf" data-track-category="body text link">in the latest update to its guidance</a>, in 2017, it settled for merely encouraging data sharing and requiring statements about whether and where data would be shared.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The ICMJE secretary, Christina Wee, says that “there are major feasibility challenges” to be resolved to mandate IPD sharing, although the committee might revisit its practices in future. Many publishers of medical journals told <i>Nature</i>’s news team that, following ICMJE advice, they didn’t require IPD from authors of trials. (These publishers included Springer Nature; <i>Nature</i>’s news team is editorially independent.)</p><p>Some journals, however — including Carlisle’s <i>Anaesthesia</i> — have gone further and do already require IPD. “Most authors provide the data when told it is a requirement,” Carlisle says.</p><p>Even when IPD are shared, says Wilkinson, scouring it in the way that Carlisle does is a time-consuming exercise — creating a further burden for reviewers — although computational checks of statistics might help.</p><p>Besides asking for data, journal editors could also speed up their decision-making, research-integrity specialists say. When sleuths raise concerns, editors should be prepared to put expressions of concern on medical studies more quickly if they don’t hear back from authors, Avenell says. This April, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/39343/documents/194466/default" data-track="click" data-label="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/39343/documents/194466/default" data-track-category="body text link">UK parliamentary report into reproducibility and research integrity</a> said that it should not take longer than two months for publishers to publish corrections or retractions of research when academics raise issues.</p><p>And if journals do retract studies, authors of systematic reviews should be required to correct their work, Avenell and others say. This rarely happens. Last year, for instance, Avenell’s team reported that it had carefully and repeatedly e-mailed authors and journal editors of the 88 reviews that cited Sato’s retracted trials to inform them that their reviews included retracted work. They got few responses — only 11 of the 88 reviews have been updated so far — suggesting that authors and editors didn’t generally care about correcting the reviews<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>.</p><p>That was dispiriting but not surprising to the team, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230718112821/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01884-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01884-2" data-track-category="body text link">has previously recounted how institutional investigations into Sato’s work were opaque and inadequate</a>. The Cochrane collaboration, for its part, stated in updated guidance in 2021 that systematic reviews must be updated when retractions occur.</p><p>Ultimately, a lingering question is — as with paper mills — why so many suspect RCTs are being produced in the first place. Mol, from his experiences investigating the Egyptian studies, blames lack of oversight and superficial assessments that promote academics on the basis of their number of publications, as well as the lack of stringent checks from institutions and journals on bad practices. Egyptian authorities have taken some steps to improve governance of trials, however; Egypt’s parliament, for instance, published its first clinical research law in December 2020.</p><p>“The solution’s got to be fixes at the source,” says Carlisle. “When this stuff is churned out, it’s like fighting a wildfire and failing.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/pqxdh_header.png" alt="An abstract illustration of a Bloch Sphere"></p><p>The Signal Protocol is a set of cryptographic specifications that provides end-to-end encryption for private communications exchanged daily by billions of people around the world. After its publication in 2013, the Signal Protocol was adopted not only by Signal but well beyond. Technical information on the Signal Protocol can be found in the specifications section of our <a href="https://signal.org/docs/" title="Signal Technical Information">docs</a> site.</p><p>Today we are happy to announce the first step in advancing quantum resistance for the Signal Protocol: an upgrade to the <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/x3dh/" title="The X3DH Key Agreement Protocol">X3DH</a> specification which we are calling <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/" title="The PQXDH Key Agreement Protocol">PQXDH</a>. With this upgrade, we are adding a layer of protection against the threat of a quantum computer being built in the future that is powerful enough to break current encryption standards.</p><p>This post is written to introduce this work to non-experts, and will review what quantum computing is and the challenges it presents for current cryptographic algorithms, before providing a high level overview of how we are adapting our specifications to answer these challenges. If you would like to skip this summary and explore our PQXDH specification in depth, you can read our technical whitepaper <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/" title="The PQXDH Key Agreement Protocol">here</a>.</p><h2 id="public-key-cryptography-primer">Public Key Cryptography Primer</h2><p>In order to explain why quantum computers pose a risk to existing cryptographic algorithms, it is first necessary to understand some of the broad strokes of how these algorithms work. The most logical place to start is with the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)" title="The RSA Cryptosystem">RSA Cryptosystem</a>, because it provides an accessible example.</p><p>The RSA Cryptosystem is one element in a category of algorithms known as public key cryptosystems. Public key cryptosystems make it possible for someone to publish a public key that anyone can use to encrypt messages to that person. The person keeps a related private key which allows them to decrypt any message that has been encrypted with their published public key.</p><p>In order to make this work, RSA relies on a mathematical one-way function. A one-way function is easy to compute in one direction, but requires substantially more work to compute in reverse. The one-way function RSA relies upon is the multiplication and factorization of large prime numbers. It is computationally easy to multiply two large primes together to compute the product, but much more computationally intensive to find the original primes from their product.</p><p>The RSA cryptosystem works by first picking two large prime numbers at random and publishing the product of the two as one part of a public key. The selected prime numbers are kept private. This relies upon the difficulty of factoring this product to keep the two primes secret.</p><p>Although we have used RSA as an example to aid this primer, Signal does not use the RSA Cryptosystem in its protocols. Instead, Signal uses <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography" title="Elliptic Curve Cryptography">elliptic curve cryptography</a> as the public key cryptosystem supporting many of its specifications. Instead of prime <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization" title="Integer Factorization">integer factorization</a>, as in the RSA example above, elliptic curve cryptography relies upon the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm" title="Discrete Logarithm Problem">discrete logarithm problem</a> as its one-way function. While these two problems are distinct, they are both instances of a mathematical problem known as the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_subgroup_problem" title="Hidden Subgroup Problem">hidden subgroup problem</a>.</p><h2 id="quantum-computing">Quantum Computing</h2><p>Quantum computing represents a new type of computational system which leverages quantum mechanical properties to solve certain complex problems many orders of magnitude more quickly than modern classical computers. Instead of bits as in a classical computer, quantum computers operate on qubits. Rather than 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a superposition of states, in some sense allowing them to be both values at once. One place where quantum computers appear to have a significant advantage over classical computers is solving instances of the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_subgroup_problem" title="Hidden Subgroup Problem">hidden subgroup problem</a>.</p><p>Quantum computing is unlikely to replace or supplant classical computers for our day-to-day use for the foreseeable future because classical computers are often better at the typical use cases for our laptops, tablets, and phones. Quantum computing systems will likely be built to take alternate approaches to some of the problems we rely on supercomputers to tackle today, whether this is modeling protein folding, forecasting weather, or factoring large numbers. It’s important to understand that quantum computers are not “better” computers but rather different types of computers.</p><p>Although quantum computers already exist, the systems known to exist today do not yet have <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/factor-15-shors-algorithm" title="It's been 20 years since \&quot;15\&quot; was factored on quantum hardware">enough qubits</a> to pose a threat to the public-key cryptography that Signal currently uses. However, if a sufficiently powerful quantum computer were built in the future, it could be used to compute a private key from a public key thereby breaking encrypted messages. This kind of threat is known as <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later" title="Harvest Now, Decrypt Later">Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL)</a>.</p><p>The timeline for when a sufficiently powerful quantum computer may be created is a matter of great debate. On the low end, some argue it is only a couple of years away. On the high end some say 30+ years, and there are even those who assert that we may never solve the challenges necessary to make a quantum computer with enough coherent qubits to break the current public key cryptosystems. The middle ground seems to be around the 5 to 10 year time horizon. We are not in a position to judge which timeline is most likely, but we do see a real and growing risk which means we need to take steps today to address the future possibility of a large enough quantum computer being created.</p><h2 id="securing-signal-against-a-future-quantum-computer">Securing Signal Against a Future Quantum Computer</h2><p>To address this problem, new post-quantum cryptosystems have been created to implement new one-way functions that cannot be advantageously reversed by a quantum computer. Thanks to innovation from cryptographic researchers and the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography" title="NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography">NIST Standardization Process for Post-Quantum Cryptography</a> we now have stable options that have been created and vetted by a large community of experts.</p><p>Even with the contributions of a community of experts, building and evaluating these new cryptosystems remains a challenging endeavor. During NIST’s standardization process, one of the post-quantum algorithm candidates was found to be <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/news/269080-nist-post-quantum-cryptography-candidate-cracked/fulltext" title="NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Candidate Cracked">attackable</a> by a classical computer. While this shows that the scrutiny of the standardization process is working, it also suggests that one should integrate these new post-quantum options cautiously.</p><p>We believe that the key encapsulation mechanism we have selected, <a href="https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/" title="CRYSTALS-Kyber">CRYSTALS-Kyber</a>, is built on solid foundations, but to be safe we do not want to simply replace our existing <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography" title="Elliptic Curve Cryptography">elliptic curve cryptography</a> foundations with a post-quantum public key cryptosystem. Instead, we are augmenting our existing cryptosystems such that an attacker must break <em>both</em> systems in order to compute the keys protecting people’s communications.</p><p>The essence of our protocol upgrade from <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/x3dh/" title="The X3DH Key Agreement Protocol">X3DH</a> to <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/" title="The PQXDH Key Agreement Protocol">PQXDH</a> is to compute a shared secret, data known only to the parties involved in a private communication session, using both the elliptic curve key agreement protocol <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519" title="X25519">X25519</a> and the post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism <a href="https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/" title="CRYSTALS-Kyber">CRYSTALS-Kyber</a>. We then combine these two shared secrets together so that any attacker must break both X25519 and CRYSTALS-Kyber to compute the same shared secret.</p><p>Our new protocol is already supported in the latest versions of Signal’s client applications and is in use for chats initiated after both sides of the chat are using the latest Signal software. In the coming months (after sufficient time has passed for everyone using Signal to update), we will disable <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/x3dh/" title="The X3DH Key Agreement Protocol">X3DH</a> for new chats and require <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/" title="The PQXDH Key Agreement Protocol">PQXDH</a> for all new chats. In parallel, we will roll out software updates to upgrade existing chats to this new protocol.</p><h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2><p><a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/" title="The PQXDH Key Agreement Protocol">PQXDH</a> protects messages exchanged on Signal against the threat of a future quantum computer. We will need to make further upgrades to address the threat of an attacker with a contemporaneous quantum computer. Further research in the area of post-quantum cryptography will be needed to fill in the remaining gaps. We recommend reading the security considerations section of our <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/" title="The PQXDH Key Agreement Protocol">PQXDH whitepaper</a> for more information on the areas of open research.</p><h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2><p>We want to extend our sincerest thanks and appreciation to all the people who contributed to the development of this protocol upgrade.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>TLDR; Graphite enables a git workflow called “stacking” - the fastest way to develop and ship code, which many large tech companies have been using for years. Graphite makes stacking available to anyone with a GitHub account.</p><p>Hi HN!</p><p>I’m Tomas, co-founder of graphite.dev, and today we’re launching Graphite after almost two years of development in closed beta. [1] Graphite started as an internal solution to our own problem. When we (engineers from Meta, Google and Airbnb) left our previous roles, we lost access to the internal code review tools we loved. So we built our own.</p><p>https://graphite.dev</p><p>---</p><p>Graphite is how the fastest developers ship code - it’s a developer tool that allows you to create smaller pull requests, stay unblocked, and ship faster with “stacking” (creating a set of dependent pull requests). Stacking [2] allows developers to break up large pull requests (PRs) into smaller ones that can be reviewed &amp; merged independently, while keeping ongoing development unblocked. Engineering best practices at Google advise that a “reasonable” PR be around 100 lines, and recommend splitting PRs in order to achieve this through stacking or other methods. [3]</p><p>Unlike other tools like Phabricator, Gerrit, or Sapling, Graphite syncs seamlessly with your GitHub repositories, so that you don’t have to manage any extra infrastructure. This also means that even if your teammates don’t use Graphite yet, you still can.</p><p>Here’s what you can expect when you sign in to Graphite with your GitHub account:</p><p>(1) First class support for stacking: At its core, Graphite enables “stacking”—a workflow used by engineers at top companies like Meta and Google to create small, dependent sets of pull requests. The Graphite CLI, web app, and VS Code extension all come together to empower engineers to start stacking.</p><p>(2) Pull request inbox: You can think of this as your home page on Graphite, where you have full visibility into the status of all your PRs and know what still needs to be done across every repo, author, and stage of review. You can also create custom inboxes that filter PRs on reviewers, authors, labels, CI status, and more.</p><p>(3) Streamlined code review interface: Graphite’s pull request page removes tabs and minimizes distractions, with the aim of putting your code front and center. You can use keyboard shortcuts to navigate between files and comments or to move between PRs in your stack. You can also import custom memes and gifs to add some  to your reviews too!</p><p>(4) AI-powered pull requests: Auto-generate a detailed description for every PR with our OpenAI integration. You can even turn your comments into suggested code changes (coming soon!).</p><p>(5) Real-time notifications: Connect Graphite to your Slack workspace to stay up-to-date on review requests, comments threads, merge status, and other activity on your PRs. For smaller PRs, you can leave a review (and even merge) directly from Slack.</p><p>(6) Stack-aware merges: Since Graphite is built to support a stacking workflow, it automates the manual work of rebasing PRs when it’s time to merge. You can merge your stacks with one click from the web app, or in a single command from the CLI.</p><p>Feel free to take a look at our getting started guide [4] or product tour video [5] for a tutorial on how to get started, and drop your comments to us below!</p><p>[1] http://graphite.dev/blog/launch</p><p>[2] http://stacking.dev</p><p>[3] https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/developer/small-cls.html</p><p>[4] https://graphite.dev/docs/getting-started-with-graphite</p><p>[5] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBcd9uopLOY</p></div></td></div></div>]]></description>

For example, virtual threads from Project Loom are now fully supported on GraalVM, including Native Image — you no longer need to enable them as a preview feature.</p><p id="a079">As always, you can get the builds from <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">graalvm.org/downloads</a>.</p><p id="4a59">Now, let’s look at what’s in this release! Keep reading to learn what’s new in Native Image and GraalVM JDK, and go to the <a rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/p/1e5c8cdaaff/">related blog post</a> for updates to Truffle and GraalVM languages.</p><h2 id="0df7">AOT at the Speed of JIT</h2><p id="0cb6">In our previous <a rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/graalvm/a-new-graalvm-release-and-new-free-license-4aab483692f5#a7f7">release blog post</a>, we shared performance comparisons on the example of Spring Petclinic: we showed how Native Image is ahead of JIT in several performance metrics, such as startup, memory usage, requests/GB-s, and latency. With this release, for the same Petclinic app we see <strong>Native Image outperforming JIT.</strong></p><p id="cc8e">The application running on Oracle GraalVM Native Image with profile-guided optimizations (<a href="https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/guides/optimize-native-executable-with-pgo/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">PGO</a>) and the <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/optimizations-and-performance/MemoryManagement/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">G1 GC</a> achieves a peak throughput of 13'075 requests per second, while the same application running on JIT with C2 JIT compiler and the same G1 GC achieves only 12'488 requests per second.</p><figure><figcaption>Performance of Spring Petclinic with Oracle GraalVM Native Image and GraalVM CE with C2 JIT. The benchmarking experiment ran the latest <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Spring Petclinic</a> on Oracle X5–2 servers (Intel Xeon E5–2699 v3), restricting the workload to 16 CPUs and setting a maximum heap size of 1GB.</figcaption></figure><p id="f344">Some more performance observations from this benchmark ( running with the heap size of 512MB):</p><figure><figcaption>Performance of Spring Petclinic with Oracle GraalVM Native Image and GraalVM CE with C2 JIT. The benchmarking experiment ran the latest <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Spring Petclinic</a> on Oracle X5–2 servers (Intel Xeon E5–2699 v3), restricting the workload to 16 CPUs and setting a maximum heap size of 512MB.</figcaption></figure><p id="cfba">The chart below shows the correlation between ops/GB*s and specific maximum Java heap (via <code>-Xmx</code>). You can see how Oracle Native Image consistently provides more throughput per compute resource for all heap sizes. So applications of all sizes will see more throughput per memory with Oracle GraalVM Native Image, but specifically, the applications with small and medium heaps, up and around 1GB, can get almost twice as much throughput per compute resources as when running on JIT:</p><figure></figure><p id="1d1d">So now with Native Image you can maximize all performance aspects: <strong>peak throughput, latency, memory usage, startup, and packaging size</strong>. Give it a try yourself and feel free to share your benchmark results with us.</p><p id="5b62">As always, there are more Native Image performance updates in this release.</p><p id="d6a1"><strong>G1 GC now works on Linux AArch64</strong> (in addition to Linux x64). You can enable it by passing <code>--gc=G1</code> to Native Image via the command line or in your build file. While there are many possible GC strategies, for those looking for the best peak performance we recommend evaluating the combination of G1 and PGO.</p><p id="1411"><strong>New optimization levels policy</strong>. There are several optimization levels in Native Image you can choose from. You might be familiar with <code>-Ob</code>, the quick build mode, which can be used in development for faster builds. When you build your application for production, you should compile with more optimizations for better performance— when no custom option is provided, Native Image defaults to <code>-O2</code>. This level of optimization provides high performance, 10–15% faster compile times, and has been tuned for common Java microservice workloads.</p><p id="8294">Now we are introducing <strong>a new optimization level in Oracle GraalVM, </strong><code><strong>-O3</strong></code>, which applies maximum optimizations for the best peak performance. You can enable this optimization level yourself, and if you’re using PGO, it will be triggered automatically.</p><h2 id="b373">Developer Experience</h2><ul><li id="18d4">You can now use the option <code>--parallelism</code> to control how many threads are used by the build process — for example, <code>--parallelism=4.</code></li><li id="31b7">There are several other updates to the build output — it now shows the memory and thread limits of the build process, and you can control the color of output with <code>--color.</code></li><li id="1118">We’ve made changes to the <strong>memory limits</strong> of the Native Image build process. By default, the build process only uses free memory: this approach is intended to avoid slowing down your machine and other processes. If free memory is less than 8GB, the build process will use 85% of total memory. So if you observe your machine being slow during native builds, consider closing those processes you don’t need.</li><li id="89dd"><code>native-image-inspect</code> in Oracle GraalVM can now dump the heap of executables and shared libraries: <code>native-image-inspect --heap path/to/image</code>.</li><li id="2ff6"><strong>Special exception handling for missing metadata</strong>. Previously, missing metadata could lead to program misbehavior that was hard to debug. Now in cases when the metadata entry is missing, the call that was requiring it will fail with the special exception — for example, <code>MissingReflectionMetadataException</code>. There are also similar exceptions for missing resources and serialization metadata.</li><li id="104d"><strong>New Class Initialization Strategy.</strong> In this release, we are introducing a <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/pull/4684" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">new class initialization approach</a> that will become the default in the future: all classes are now allowed to be used and initialized at build time, regardless of the class initialization configuration. For classes that are configured as <code>--initialize-at-run-time</code> this means that they will appear as uninitialized again at run time. To enable the new approach, pass the <code>--strict-image-heap</code> flag to Native Image. In case you run into errors or issues with it, we will share more details in a blog post that will go out together with the October 24 patch release.</li><li id="beb1"><code>gu</code> is no longer needed for Native Image and GraalVM languages — learn how to <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/6855" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">use additional components</a> now.</li><li id="aa8e">Support for the JFR event <code>ThreadCPULoad</code> was <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/pull/6588" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">contributed</a> by BellSoft.</li></ul><h2 id="a7fb">Experimental Build Options in Native Image</h2><p id="b0f3">There are many <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/overview/BuildOptions/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">build options</a> in Native Image, most of which are stable, and some are experimental. To provide better awareness and control over options that are being used and avoid misuse, in this release we have added a new <code>-H:±UnlockExperimentalVMOptions</code> option to explicitly handle experimental options. Here’s how you can unlock and lock experimental options:</p><pre><span id="20f0">native-image -H:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -H:SomeExperimentalOption \<br>             -H:-UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -cp ./ HelloWorld</span></pre><p id="5d81">Explicit enabling of experimental options will become required in the next release, but you can test this already in GraalVM for JDK 21 using the environment variable <code>NATIVE_IMAGE_EXPERIMENTAL_OPTIONS_ARE_FATAL=true</code>.</p><p id="f447">As we are stabilizing the public API, we encourage your feedback on which experimental features you are actively using in <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/7370" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">the corresponding roadmap ticket</a>.</p><h2 id="e8c1">Control Flow Integrity in Native Image</h2><p id="cf0a">Oracle GraalVM now provides a form of control flow integrity (CFI) using ARM Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) on supported hardware. PAC mitigates return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks by ensuring the integrity of the return address of a function call: the return address is signed on function entry and the signature is checked before function return. Any tampering is detected by the CPU. You can enable it with the <code>-H:EnableCFI</code> option.</p><h2 id="1480">JDK and Compiler updates</h2><p id="300f">We implemented an initial optimization of <strong>Java Vector API (</strong><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/338" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>JEP 338</strong></a><strong>) operations </strong>in Oracle GraalVM. Multiple operations on the JVM are now transformed to efficient machine instructions where possible. This optimization is enabled by default (you can disable it with <code>-Dgraal.OptimizeVectorAPI=false</code>) and we welcome your feedback.</p><p id="877d">We also implemented several intrinsics for JDK 21 for both x64 and AArch64 architectures.</p><h2 id="8c38">Refactoring GraalVM SDK</h2><p id="6848"><a href="https://www.graalvm.org/sdk/javadoc/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The GraalVM SDK</a> is split into four fine-grained modules:</p><ul><li id="649f"><code>org.graalvm.nativeimage</code>: The public API of Native Image for advanced use cases.</li><li id="74d0"><code>org.graalvm.polyglot</code>: A library that allows users to embed polyglot language implementations in Java.</li><li id="c64f"><code>org.graalvm.word</code>: A low-level library for machine-word-sized values in Java.</li><li id="64d2"><code>org.graalvm.collections</code>: A collections library for GraalVM components.</li></ul><p id="8dc2">Note that all GraalVM APIs remain compatible in this release.</p><h2 id="f33a">Ecosystem and Community</h2><ul><li id="3d99">GraalVM’s Maven and Gradle plugin, <a href="https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/latest/index.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Native Build Tools</a>, released a new version, <a href="https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/latest/index.html#_release_0_9_27" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">0.9.27</a>.</li><li id="5512"><a href="https://github.com/oracle/graalvm-reachability-metadata/releases" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GraalVM Reachability Metadata</a> received several new contributions, such as metadata for <code>org.apache.kafka:kafka-clients</code>, <code>commons-logging:commons-logging</code>, <code>org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient</code>, <code>liquibase-core</code>,<code>org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3,</code> and other projects.</li><li id="e643">Micronaut® framework 4.0 was released with support for a new GraalVM version and <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graalvm-reachability-metadata" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GraalVM Reachability Metadata Repository</a>.</li><li id="134f">10MinuteMail shared how they used <a href="https://www.digitalsanctuary.com/10minutemail/migrating-10minutemail-from-java-to-graalvm-native.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GraalVM and Spring Boot 3</a> to reduce their startup time from ~30 s down to about 3 ms, and memory usage from 6.6 GB down to 1 GB, with the same throughput and CPU utilization.</li><li id="798c">The Ballerina team <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDRi3rNiFqo" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">reached similar results</a> with GraalVM: their application went from 980 ms to 52 ms startup time and from 242 MB to 93 MB RSS with GraalVM.</li><li id="d6e4"><a href="https://twitter.com/mraible" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Matt Raible</a> compared the performance of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoU1ruBSXSA" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Native Java REST API Frameworks</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="577d">Conclusion</h2><p id="d3d8">We want to take this opportunity to thank our community for all the feedback, suggestions, and contributions that went into this release.

									<p>Walter Isaacson’s biography of Tesla CEO Elon Musk has uncovered several intriguing revelations. The latest revelation raises serious questions as to whether or not Tesla values its drivers’ privacy.</p>
<p>In his book, Isaacson shows how Musk wanted to spy on drivers to defend Tesla from lawsuits.</p>
<p>Musk insisted on using the internal monitoring camera in Tesla vehicles to record drivers’ behaviors behind the wheel. This driver behavior was to be used as evidence to safeguard the company during investigations following accidents. By recording driver behavior, Musk could argue that driver error led to the accidents rather than Tesla technology.</p>
<p>While most car manufacturers employ internal cameras to monitor driver attentiveness and issue warnings, Musk envisioned Tesla taking it a step further. The book highlights Musk’s push to collect data from the car’s cameras, including the one focused on the driver, to establish instances of driver error. Drivers were not to be informed about the monitoring.</p>
<p>However, during a meeting, a Tesla manager raised concerns regarding privacy. The manager pointed out that Musk’s driver monitoring technology would not be able to link the recorded footage to specific vehicles, even in the event of a crash.</p>
<p>Musk ignored the manager’s concerns. However, he did back down somewhat on his idea to spy on drivers without their consent.</p>
<p>Musk proposed a pop-up message, informing customers that data would be collected if they used the Full Self-Driving Beta feature. This placated the manager.</p>
<p>The pop-up exists in current Tesla vehicles and explains how the company plans to use data from the internal camera. Drivers are given the choice to agree or disagree with Tesla collecting cabin camera data.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that Tesla has not yet used internal vehicle images in legal disputes or investigations relating to the Autopilot system.</p>
<p>Even with Tesla’s use of pop-up messages, there continues to be numerous privacy complaints against the company.</p>
<p><a href="https://insideevs.com/news/687228/musk-wanted-use-tesla-in-car-video-win-lawsuits-biography/">According to InsideEVs</a>, Tesla is currently facing multiple class action lawsuits regarding video privacy. In one lawsuit, plaintiffs are alleging that groups of Tesla employees privately shared highly invasive videos captured by customers’ car cameras between 2019 and 2022.</p>
<p>Another lawsuit in Illinois specifically focuses on privacy violations involving the cabin camera.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/441">JEP 441</a> Pattern
Matching for switch<a href="#441" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Enhance the Java programming language with pattern matching for

Function &amp; Memory API (Third Preview)<a href="#442" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Introduce an API by which Java programs can interoperate with
code and data outside of the Java runtime. By efficiently invoking
foreign functions (i.e., code outside the JVM), and by safely
accessing foreign memory (i.e., memory not managed by the JVM), the
API enables Java programs to call native libraries and process
native data without the brittleness and danger of JNI. This is a

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/444">JEP 444</a> Virtual
Threads<a href="#444" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>

threads are lightweight threads that dramatically reduce the effort
of writing, maintaining, and observing high-throughput concurrent
applications.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/445">JEP 445</a> Unnamed
Classes and Instance Main Methods (Preview)<a href="#445" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Evolve the Java language so that students can write their first
programs without needing to understand language features designed
for large programs. Far from using a separate dialect of Java,
students can write streamlined declarations for single-class
programs and then seamlessly expand their programs to use more
advanced features as their skills grow. This is a <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/12">preview language feature</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/446">JEP 446</a> Scoped
Values (Preview)<a href="#446" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Introduce <em>scoped values</em>, values that may be safely and
efficiently shared to methods without using method parameters. They
are preferred to thread-local variables, especially when using
large numbers of virtual threads. This is a <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/12">preview API</a>.</p>
<p>In effect, a scoped value is an <em>implicit method
parameter</em>. It is "as if" every method in a sequence of calls
has an additional, invisible, parameter. None of the methods
declare this parameter and only the methods that have access to the
scoped value object can access its value (the data). Scoped values
make it possible to pass data securely from a caller to a faraway
callee through a sequence of intermediate methods that do not
declare a parameter for the data and have no access to the
data.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/451">JEP 451</a> Prepare to
Disallow the Dynamic Loading of Agents<a href="#451" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Issue warnings when agents are loaded dynamically into a running
JVM. These warnings aim to prepare users for a future release which
disallows the dynamic loading of agents by default in order to
<a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/8305968">improve integrity by
default</a>. Serviceability tools that load agents at startup will
not cause warnings to be issued in any release.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/452">JEP 452</a> Key
Encapsulation Mechanism API<a href="#452" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<p>Introduce an API for key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), an
encryption technique for securing symmetric keys using public key
cryptography.</p>

<h3><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/453">JEP 453</a> Structured
Concurrency (Preview)<a href="#453" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>

terminate.</li>
<li><code>void shutdownNow()</code>: initiates an immediate
shutdown, trying to interrupt active operations, and returns
immediately without waiting for the client to terminate.</li>
<li><code>boolean awaitTermination(Duration duration)</code>, waits
for the client to terminate, within the given duration; returns
true if the client is terminated, false otherwise.</li>
<li><code>boolean isTerminated()</code>: returns true if the client

<p>Note that an <code>HttpClient</code> instance typically manages
its own pools of connections, which it may then reuse when
necessary. Connection pools are typically not shared between

<section>core-libs/java.util:collections</section>
<section>
<p>The Sequenced Collection API introduces several new interfaces
into the collections framework, providing enhancements to many
existing collections classes. The new API facilitates access to
elements at each end of a sequenced collection, and provides the
ability to view and iterate such collections in reverse order. See
<a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/431">JEP 431</a> for additional
information.</p>
<p>The introduction of new collections interfaces, along with
default methods, introduces some compatibility risk, including the
possibility of both source and binary incompatibilities. The
introduction of default methods in an interface hierarchy may cause
conflicts with methods declared on existing classes or interfaces
that extend collections interfaces - this could result in either
source or binary incompatibilities. The introduction of new
interfaces also introduces new types into the system, which can
change the results of type inference, leading in turn to source
incompatibilities.</p>
<p>For a discussion of potential incompatibilities and possible
ways to mitigate them, please see the document <a href="https://inside.java/2023/05/12/quality-heads-up/">JDK 21:

<h3>Warning Printed when an Agent Is Loaded into a Running VM
<span>( <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/451">JEP 451</a>)</span><a href="#JDK-8307478" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<section>core-svc/tools</section>
<section>
<p>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) now prints a warning to standard
error when a JVM Tool Interface (JVM TI) agent or Java Agent is
dynamically loaded into a running JVM. The warning is intended to
prepare for a future release that disallows, by default, dynamic
loading of agent code into a running JVM.</p>
<p>Agents are programs that run in the JVM process and make use of
powerful JVM TI or <code>java.lang.instrument</code> APIs. These
APIs are designed to support tooling such as profilers and
debuggers. Agents are started via a command line option, for
example <code>-agentlib</code> or <code>-javaagent</code>, or they
can be started into a running VM using the JDK specific
<code>com.sun.tools.attach</code> API or the <code>jcmd</code>
command. Agents loaded into a running VM will now print a warning.
There is no warning for agents that are loaded at startup via
command line options.</p>
<p>The HotSpot VM option <code>EnableDynamicAgentLoading</code>
controls dynamic loading of agents. This option has existed since
JDK 9. The default, since JDK 9, is to allow dynamic loading of
agents. Running with <code>-XX:+EnableDynamicAgentLoading</code> on
the command line serves as an explicit "opt-in" that allows agent
code to be loaded into a running VM and thus suppresses the
warning. Running with <code>-XX:-EnableDynamicAgentLoading</code>
disallows agent code from being loaded into a running VM and can be
used to test possible future behavior.</p>
<p>In addition, the system property
<code>jdk.instrument.traceUsage</code> can be used to trace uses of
the <code>java.lang.instrument</code> API. Running with
<code>-Djdk.instrument.traceUsage</code> or
<code>-Djdk.instrument.traceUsage=true</code> causes usages of the
API to print a trace message and stack trace. This can be used to
identify agents that are dynamically loaded instead of being
started on the command line with <code>-javaagent</code>.</p>

<p>This feature delivers an enhanced syntax for properties related
to certificate, CRL, and OCSP connect and read timeouts. The new
syntax allows the timeout values to be specified either in seconds
or milliseconds. This feature also delivers three new System
properties related to connect and read timeouts.</p>
<p><em>New properties</em>: The existing
<code>com.sun.security.ocsp.timeout</code> property will now be
paired with the new <code>com.sun.security.ocsp.readtimeout</code>
property. The former property will be used to set timeouts for the
transport-layer connection while the latter will be used to manage
timeouts for reading the data. The new
<code>com.sun.security.cert.timeout</code> and
<code>com.sun.security.cert.readtimeout</code> properties will be
used to control connect and read timeouts, respectively, when
following an X.509 certificate's AuthorityInfoAccess extension. For
the certificate fetching properties, the
<code>com.sun.security.enableAIAcaIssuers</code> property must be
set to <code>true</code> in order for fetching to occur and these
property timeouts to be enabled.</p>
<p><em>Enhanced timeout syntax</em>: The new syntax applies to the
aforementioned properties, and also to the
<code>com.sun.security.crl.timeout</code> and
<code>com.sun.security.crl.readtimeout</code> properties as well.
The allowed syntax is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A decimal integer will be interpreted in seconds and ensures
backward compatibility.</li>
<li>A decimal integer ending in "s" (case-insensitive, no space)
appended to it. This will also be interpreted in seconds.</li>
<li>A decimal integer value with "ms" (case-insensitive, no space)
appended to it. This will be interpreted as milliseconds. For
example, a value of "2500ms" will be a 2.5 second timeout.</li>
<li>Negative, non-numeric, or non-decimal (for example, hexadecimal
values prepended by "0x") values will be interpreted as illegal and
will default to the 15 second timeout.</li>
<li>Whether the value is interpreted in seconds or milliseconds, a
value of zero will disable the timeout.</li>

the <code>here()</code> function in new signatures and replacing
existing signatures that use the <code>here()</code> function.
Future versions of the JDK will likely disable, and eventually
remove, support for this function, as it cannot be supported using
the standard Java XPath API. Users can now disable the
<code>here()</code> function by setting the security property
<code>jdk.xml.dsig.hereFunctionSupported</code> to "false".</p>

<h3>Fixed Indefinite <code>jspawnhelper</code> Hangs <span>(<a href="https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8307990">JDK-8307990</a>)</span><a href="#JDK-8307990" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<section>core-libs/java.lang</section>
<section>
<p>Since JDK 13, executing commands in a sub-process uses the
so-called <code>POSIX_SPAWN</code> launching mechanism (that is,
<code>-Djdk.lang.Process.launchMechanism=POSIX_SPAWN</code>) by
default on Linux. In cases where the parent JVM process terminates
abnormally before the handshake between the JVM and the newly
created <code>jspawnhelper</code> process has completed,
<code>jspawnhelper</code> can hang indefinitely in JDK 13 to JDK
20. This issue is fixed in JDK 21. The issue was especially harmful
if the parent process had open sockets, because in that case, the
forked <code>jspawnhelper</code> process will inherit them and keep
all the corresponding ports open, effectively preventing other
processes from binding to them.</p>
<p>This misbehavior has been observed with applications which
frequently fork child processes in environments with tight memory
constraints. In such cases, the OS can kill the JVM in the middle
of the forking process leading to the described issue. Restarting
the JVM process after such a crash will be impossible if the new
process tries to bind to the same ports as the initial application
because they will be blocked by the hanging
<code>jspawnhelper</code> child process.</p>
<p>The root cause of this issue is <code>jspawnhelper</code>'s
omission to close its writing end of the pipe, which is used for
the handshake with the parent JVM. It was fixed by closing the
writing end of the communication pipe before attempting to read
data from the parent process. This way, <code>jspawnhelper</code>
will reliably read an EOF event from the communication pipe and
terminate once the parent process dies prematurely.</p>
<p>A second variant of this issue could happen because the
handshaking code in the JDK didn't handle interrupts to
<code>write(2)</code> correctly. This could lead to incomplete
messages being sent to the <code>jspawnhelper</code> child process.
The result is a deadlock between the parent thread and the child
process which manifests itself in a <code>jspawnhelper</code>
process being blocked while reading from a pipe and the following
stack trace in the corresponding parent Java process:</p>

<section>
<p>Maintainers of applications that do network multicasting or use
the <code>java.net.NetworkInterface</code> API should note that the
names that the JDK assigns to network interfaces on Windows have
changed in this release. The JDK historically synthesized names for
network interfaces on Windows. This has changed to use the names
assigned by the Windows operating system. For example, the JDK may
have historically assigned a name such as “eth0” for an ethernet
interface and “lo” for the loopback. The equivalent names that
Windows assigns may be names such as “ethernet_32768” and
“loopback_0".</p>
<p>This change may impact code that does a lookup of network
interfaces with the <code>NetworkInterace.getByName(String
name)</code> method. It also may also be surprising to code that
enumerates all network interfaces with the
<code>NetworkInterfaces.networkInterfaces()</code> or
<code>NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces()</code> methods as the
names of the network interfaces will look different to previous
releases. Depending on configuration, it is possible that
enumerating all network interfaces will enumerate network
interfaces that weren’t previously enumerated because they didn’t
have an Internet Protocol address assigned. The display name
returned by <code>NetworkInterface::getDisplayName</code> has not
changed so this should facilitate the identification of network
interfaces when using Windows native tools.</p>

<h3><code>java.util.Formatter</code> May Return Slightly Different

<p>The implementation of <code>java.util.Formatter</code> for
<code>double</code> and <code>float</code> conversions to decimal
(<code>'e'</code>, <code>'E'</code>, <code>'f'</code>,
<code>'g'</code>, <code>'G'</code>) is now aligned with the one in
<code>Double.toString(double)</code>, which was changed in JDK
19.</p>
<p>As a consequence, in some rare circumstances, the outcomes may
slightly differ from the ones in earlier releases.</p>
<p>One example is with <code>double</code> <code>2e23</code> and
format <code>"%.16e"</code>. With this change, the outcome is
<code>2.0000000000000000e+23</code>, while earlier releases produce
<code>1.9999999999999998e+23</code>. Any smaller precision in the
format (e.g., "%.15e") on this value will produce outcomes that are
equal to each other, though.</p>
<p>Another example is with <code>double</code>
<code>9.9e-324</code> and format <code>"%.2g"</code>. The new
outcome is <code>9.9e-324</code>, but earlier releases generate
<code>"1.0e-323"</code>.</p>

<section>hotspot/runtime</section>

<p>Starting with the July 2023 CPU, on operating systems where ASLR
(Address Space Layout Randomization) is enabled, the CDS archive
will be placed at a random address picked by the operating
system.</p>
<p>This change may have a minor performance impact: (a) Start-up
time may increase because the JVM needs to patch pointers inside
the CDS archive; (b) Memory usage may increase because the memory
used by the CDS archive is no longer shareable across processes. We
expect the impact to be small because such increases should be only
a small fraction of the overall application usage.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that you must disable ASLR for CDS, you
can use the JVM flags <code>-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions
-XX:ArchiveRelocationMode=0</code>. The usage of such flags is not
recommended.</p>

<p>Annotation processing by <code>javac</code> is enabled by

be disabled in a future release, possibly as early as JDK 22. To
alert <code>javac</code> users of this possibility, in JDK 21
<code>javac</code> prints a note if implicit annotation processing
is being used. The text of the note is:</p>
<pre><code>     Annotation processing is enabled because one or more processors were
    found on the class path. A future release of javac may disable
    annotation processing unless at least one processor is specified by
    name (-processor), or a search path is specified (--processor-path,
    --processor-module-path), or annotation processing is enabled
    explicitly (-proc:only, -proc:full).
    Use -Xlint:-options to suppress this message.
    Use -proc:none to disable annotation processing.
</code></pre>
<p>Good build hygiene includes explicitly configuring annotation
processing. To ease the transition to a different default policy in
the future, the new-in-JDK-21 <code>-proc:full javac</code> option
requests the current default behavior of looking for annotation
processors on the class path.</p>

<section>tools/javac</section>
<section>
<p>Prior to JDK 21, the <code>javac</code> compiler did not always
mark method parameters as <code>synthetic</code> or
<code>mandated</code> when applicable. Starting with JDK 21, the
<code>javac</code> compiler emits the <code>MethodParameters</code>
attribute in the class file when applicable. This attribute stores
information on whether or not parameters are <code>synthetic</code>
or <code>mandated</code>. This change applies to all release and
target versions supported by <code>javac</code> since all currently
supported releases and targets have the
<code>MethodParameters</code> attribute defined.</p>
<p>This change is justified by JLS § 13.1, in particular:</p>
<pre><code>A binary representation for a class or interface must also contain all of the following: 

[...]

11. A construct emitted by a Java compiler must be marked as synthetic if it does not
    correspond to a construct declared explicitly or implicitly in source code, unless
    the emitted construct is a class initialization method (JVMS §2.9).
12. A construct emitted by a Java compiler must be marked as mandated if it corresponds

    §15.9.5.1).

<h3>Detection for Output File Clashes <span>(<a href="https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8296656">JDK-8296656</a>)</span><a href="#JDK-8296656" title="Direct link to this note"></a></h3>
<section>tools/javac</section>
<section>
<p>A new compiler lint flag, <code>output-file-clash</code>,
enables detection of output file clashes. An output file clash is
when the compiler intends to write two different output files, but
due to the behavior of the operating system, these files end up
being written to the same underlying file.</p>
<p>This usually happens due to case-insensitive file systems. For
example, a class like this would cause two class files to be
written to the same file, <code>Test$Inner.class</code>:</p>
<pre><code>public class Test {
    class Inner {
    }
    class INNER {
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, this problem can also happen when the file system
"normalizes" file names. For example, on macOS, compiling this
class will generate such a clash:</p>
<pre><code>public class Test {
    interface Cafeu0301 {
    }
    interface Cafu00e9 {
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The reason is that <code>u0301</code> is the Unicode character
"Combining Acute Accent" which means "add an accent over the
previous character". MacOS normalizes the letter <code>e</code>
followed by a <code>u0301</code> into a Unicode <code>u00e9</code>,
that is, <code>é</code>. However, the Java language treats these
the two names, <code>Cafeu0301</code> and <code>Cafu00e9</code>, as
distinct.</p>
<p>Compiling the example above on macOS with
<code>-Xlint:output-file-clash</code> will now generate a warning
like this:</p>
<pre><code>    warning: [output-file-clash] output file written more than once: /home/test/Test$Café.class

<section>tools/javac</section>
<section>
<p>Prior to JDK 21, the <code>javac</code> compiler was omitting
some "potentially ambiguous overload" warnings enabled by the
<code>-Xlint:overloads</code> option.</p>
<p>If the <code>-Xlint:overloads</code> option is enabled, the
compiler warns when the methods in a class create a potential
ambiguity for method invocations containing an implicit lambda
expression parameter like <code>x -&gt; { ... }</code>. An
ambiguity can occur if two or more methods could match such a
method call, like when one method takes a
<code>Consumer&lt;Integer&gt;</code> parameter where the other
takes an <code>IntConsumer</code>. For example, the
<code>javac</code> compiler should issue a warning for code such
as:</p>
<pre><code>    interface I {
        void foo(Consumer&lt;Integer&gt; c);
        void foo(IntConsumer c);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Prior to JDK 21, the warning was only issued for a class if one
of the methods was declared in the class. The <code>javac</code>
compiler now also warns when neither method is declared in the
class. That is, both methods are inherited from supertypes. For
example, for code like:</p>
<pre><code>    interface I {
        void foo(Consumer&lt;Integer&gt; c);
    }

    interface J {
        void foo(IntConsumer c);
    }

    interface K extends I, J {}

						<p>Canadian Sikh Facebook users posting about the assassination of a Sikh community leader are seeing posts disappear and accounts suspended in response to legal demands by the Indian government.</p>
<p>Many Facebook posts and pages that have been flagged as being in violation of Indian law involve content relating to the legacy of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66158842" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bhai Hardeep Singh Nijjar</a>, a Sikh leader who was assassinated outside of a Surrey gurdwara in June of this year.</p>
<p>On Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the House of Commons that Canadian intelligence was pursuing “credible allegations” that “agents of the Government of India” had <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-killing-of-sikh-leader-outside-surrey-bc-temple-sparks-rage-in-the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assassinated Nijjar in Surrey, BC this summer</a>.</p>
<p>“Over the past number of weeks, Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the Government of India and the killing of a Canadian citizen, Hardeep Singh Nijjar,” Trudeau said. “Any involvement of a foreign government in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty.”</p>
<p>Since Nijjar’s assassination in June, a number of Canadian Sikh Facebook users say their posts about the community leader have been censored or unpublished by Meta following interventions by the Indian government.</p>
<p>BC Sikhs, a Facebook page that represents British Columbia’s Sikh community, currently remains “unpublished” after admins received a notice that the page was removed for failing to follow Meta’s standards on “dangerous individuals and organizations.”</p>
<p>“Your page has been unpublished,” reads a notice sent to BC Sikhs that was reviewed by <em>PressProgress</em>. “This is because BC Sikhs goes against our Community Standards on dangerous individuals and organizations.”</p>

<p>Other Sikh Facebook users based in Canada have reported similar experiences.</p>
<p>Sarbraj Singh Kahlon, a Vancouver journalist with Radio Punjab, told <em>PressProgress</em> his Facebook account was restricted after he posted about protests about Nijjar’s assassination at the Indian Consulate in Vancouver and posts commemorating the anniversary of his death.</p>
<p>Meta did not respond to multiple requests for comment from<em> PressProgress</em>, but did request additional time to look into the matter<em>.</em></p>
<p>After <em>PressProgress </em>brought the issue to Meta’s attention, BC Sikhs said their appeals were suddenly reversed and their page and posts were restored.</p>

Available.  We shipped build 35 as the first and only Release Candidate
of JDK 21 on 11 August, and no P1 bugs have been reported since then.
Build 35 is therefore now the GA build, ready for production use.

GPL-licensed OpenJDK builds from Oracle are available here:

  <a href="https://jdk.java.net/21">https://jdk.java.net/21</a>

Builds from other vendors will no doubt be available soon.

This release includes fifteen JEPs [1], including the final versions of
Record Patterns (440), Pattern Matching for switch (441), and Virtual
Threads (444):

  430: String Templates (Preview)
  431: Sequenced Collections
  439: Generational ZGC
  440: Record Patterns
  441: Pattern Matching for switch
  442: Foreign Function &amp; Memory API (Third Preview)
  443: Unnamed Patterns and Variables (Preview)
  444: Virtual Threads
  445: Unnamed Classes and Instance Main Methods (Preview)
  446: Scoped Values (Preview)
  448: Vector API (Sixth Incubator)
  449: Deprecate the Windows 32-bit x86 Port for Removal
  451: Prepare to Disallow the Dynamic Loading of Agents
  452: Key Encapsulation Mechanism API
  453: Structured Concurrency (Preview)

This release also includes, as usual, hundreds of smaller enhancements
and thousands of bug fixes.

JDK 21 will be a long-term-support (LTS) release from most vendors,
including Oracle.  If you’re upgrading from the previous LTS release,
JDK 17, then you have many more JEPs to look forward to, summarized
here:

  <a href="https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/21/jeps-since-jdk-17">https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/21/jeps-since-jdk-17</a>

Thank you to everyone who contributed this release, whether by designing
and implementing features or enhancements, by fixing bugs, or by
downloading and testing the early-access builds!

            <guid>37569258</guid>
            <pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 12:54:09 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.ovalerio.net/archives/2615">https://blog.ovalerio.net/archives/2615</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37569258">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Ten years ago, after it became clear to almost everyone that all our online activity was being tracked and stored, <a href="https://blog.ovalerio.net/archives/285" data-type="post" data-id="285">I wrote a blog post about simple steps a person could take to improve their privacy online</a>. </p>
<p>Essentially, it contains a few recommendations that everyone could follow to reduce their fingerprint without much effort. It wasn’t meant to be exhaustive, and it wasn’t meant to make you invisible online. If your personal situation needs more, you have a lot more ground to cover, which was totally out of the scope of that post. </p>
<p>The target audience was the average Joe, that doesn’t like to be spied on. Specially by commercial companies that just want to show you ads, sell you stuff or use your habits against you.</p>
<p>Many things have changed in the last 10 years, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/googles-widely-opposed-ad-platform-the-privacy-sandbox-launches-in-chrome/">while others remained the same</a>. <strong>With this in mind, I think it is time for an update to my suggestions, keeping in mind that no specialized knowledge should be required and the maximum amount of effort should not surpass 30 minutes.</strong></p>
<h2>1. Pick an ethical browser</h2>
<p>For regular users on any computer or operating system, the main window to the outside world is the browser. Nowadays, this app is of the utmost importance. </p>
<p>My initial suggestion remains valid these days, you should install and use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>. </p>
<p>There are other browsers that could also do the trick, such as Brave or Safari, but my preference still goes to Mozilla’s browser. </p>
<p>No matter your choice, <strong>you should avoid Chrome and Edge</strong>. If you want a more detailed comparison, you can check <a href="https://privacytests.org/">this website</a>.</p>
<p><em>Expected effort: 5 minutes</em></p>
<h2>2. Install important extensions</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the default configuration of a good browser is not enough, even considering it already includes many protections enabled from the start.</p>
<p>For a minimal setup, I consider 2 extensions indispensable: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">uBlock Origin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/">Privacy badger</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These will ensure that most spyware, included in a huge number of websites, isn’t loaded and does not leak your private information to third-parties. They will also block ads and other junk that make the web slow and waste your bandwidth.</p>
<p><em>Expected effort: 2 minutes</em></p>
<h2>3. Opt out of any data collection</h2>
<p>This topic is specially problematic for Microsoft Windows users. However, it is becoming an increase prevalent practice in all software vendors.</p>
<p>They will tell you they are collecting anonymous data to improve their products and services, while often the data is not that anonymous and/or the purposes are far wider than the ones they make you believe initially.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Windows is an enormous data collection machine, so to minimize the damage, you should disable as much of this as possible. If this is your operating system, you can find a step-by-step tutorial of the main things to disable <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/893162/11-windows-11-privacy-settings-to-change/">here</a> (note: you should evaluate if the last 3 steps make sense for your case).</p>
<p>If you use a different operating system, you should do a small research about what data the vendor collects.</p>
<p>The next action is to do the same on your browser. In this case, in Firefox you should paste <code>about:preferences#privacy</code> in the URL bar, look for <strong>Firefox Data Collection and Use</strong> and then disable all options.</p>
<p><em>Expected effort: </em>2–8 minutes</p>
<h2>4. Use a better DNS resolver</h2>
<p>This suggestion is a bit more technical, but important enough that I decided to include it in this guide that only covers the basics.</p>
<p>With the new configuration that we set up on points 2 and 3, in theory, we are well protected against these forms of tracking. However, there are 2 big holes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you sure the operating system settings are being respected?</li>
<li>Trackers on the browser are being blocked, but what about the other installed applications? Are they spying on you?</li>
</ul>
<p>To address the 2 points above, you can change your default DNS server to one that blocks any queries to sites tracking your activity. Two examples are <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/help/dns-over-https-and-dns-over-tls/">Mullvad DNS</a> and <a href="https://nextdns.io/">Next DNS</a>, but there are others.</p>
<p>Changing your DNS server can also help you block tracking on other devices you have less control, such as your phone or TV.</p>
<p>The links contain detailed guides on how to proceed.</p>
<p><em>Expected effort: 4–10 minutes</em></p>
<h2>5. Segregate your activity</h2>
<p>This step is more related to your behavior and browsing habits than to any tools that you need to install and configure.</p>
<p>The goal here is to clean any data websites leave behind to track you across visits and websites through time.</p>
<p>You should configure your browser to delete all cookies and website related data at the end of each session, and by this, I mean when you close your browser. </p>
<p>In Firefox, you should again to <code>about:preferences#privacy</code> search for “<strong>Cookies and Site Data</strong>” and check the option: “<strong>Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed</strong>“.</p>
<p>Sometimes this is impractical because it will force you to login into websites and apps all the time. A good compromise is to use “<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/">Multi-Account Containers</a>“, they allow you to segregate your activity into multiple isolated containers, so you can limit any tracking capabilities.</p>
<p><em>Expected effort: 3 minutes</em></p>
<h2>6. Prefer privacy preserving tools and services</h2>
<p>Most online services that common folk use, go to huge lengths to track your activities. For most of them, this is their business model.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are drop-in replacements for common tools that will provide you with similar or better service:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search Engine:</strong> use <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> / <a href="https://search.brave.com/">Brave Search</a>, avoid Google or Bing.</li>
<li><strong>Maps:</strong> use <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#">Open Street Maps</a>, avoid Google Maps.</li>
<li><strong>Online Office Suite:</strong> use <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/">CryptoPad</a>, avoid Office 365 and Google Docs.</li>
<li><strong>Video Chat:</strong> use <a href="https://meet.jit.si/">Jitsi</a>, avoid Zoom. </li>
</ul>
<p>The above are just a few examples, these choices will depend on your own needs. At first, you might find them strange, but experience tells me that soon enough you will get used to them and discover they are superior in many ways.</p>
<p><em>Expected effort: 3–5 minutes</em></p>
<h2>7. Adopt better habits</h2>
<p>I’m already a few minutes over budget, but hey, privacy is hard to achieve nowadays. </p>
<p>For this last point, the lesson is that you must be careful with the information you share and make use of GDPR to control when someone is overstepping.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips, just for you to get an idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t provide your personal data just because they ask (input random data if you think it will not be necessary).</li>
<li>Always reject cookies and disable data collection when websites show those annoying pop-ups. Look for the “reject all” button, they usually hide it.</li>
<li>Even if websites don’t prompt you about privacy settings, go to your account preferences and disable all data collection.</li>
<li>Use fake profiles / identities.</li>
<li>When too much information is needed, and you don’t see the point, search for other alternatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main message is: Be cautious and strict with all the information you share online.</p>
<h2>Concluding</h2>
<p><strong>If you followed up to this point, you already made some good progress. However, this is the bare minimum and I only covered what to do on your personal computer, even though some of these suggestions will also work on your other devices (phone, tablet, etc.).</strong></p>
<p>I avoided suggesting tools, services and practices that would imply monetary costs for the reader, but depending on your needs they might be necessary.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it is very hard not to be followed around by a “thousand companies and other entities”, specially when we carry a tracking device in our pockets, attached to our wrists, or <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/privacy-nightmare-on-wheels-every-car-brand-reviewed-by-mozilla-including-ford-volkswagen-and-toyota-flunks-privacy-test/">move around inside one of them</a>.</p>
<p>In case you want to dig deeper, there are a many sources online with more detailed guides on how to go a few steps further. As an example, you can check “<a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/en/">Privacy Guides</a>“.</p>
<p>Now, to end my post with a question (so I could also learn something new), what would you recommend differently? Would you add, remove or replace any of these suggestions? Don’t forget about the 30-minute rule. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
            
            
            <p>
              Recently at TigerBeetle,
              <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/pull/1157">we’ve decided</a>
              to use 128-bit integers to store all financial amounts and
              balances, retiring our previous use of 64-bit integers. While some
              may argue that a 64-bit integer, which can store integers ranging
              from zero to 2<sup>64</sup>, is enough to count the
              <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/krulwich/2012/09/17/161096233/which-is-greater-the-number-of-sand-grains-on-earth-or-stars-in-the-sky">grains of sand on Earth</a>, we realized we need to go beyond this limit if we want to be
              able to store all kinds of transactions adequately. Let’s
              find out why.
            </p>
            <h2 id="how-do-we-represent-money">How do we represent money?</h2>
            <p>
              To represent numbers (and to be able to do math with them),
              computers need to encode this number in a binary system which,
              depending on the range and the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number#Classification">kind</a>
              of number, requires a certain amount of bits (each bit can be
              either 0 or 1). For example, integers (whole numbers) ranging from
              -128 to 127 can be represented with only 8 bits, but if we
              don’t need negative numbers, we can use the same bits to
              represent any integer from 0 to 255, and that’s a byte!
              Larger numbers require more bits, for example, 16-bit, 32-bit, and
              64-bit numbers are the most common.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may have noticed that we are talking about money as whole
              numbers and not as decimal numbers or cents. Things get more
              complicated with fractional numbers, which can be encoded using
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">floating point</a>
              numbers. While binary floating point may be fine for other
              calculations, they
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_error_mitigation">cannot accurately express decimal numbers</a>. This is the same kind of problem that we humans have when we
              try to represent ⅓ in decimal as 0.33333…, computers have to
              represent ¹⁄₁₀ in binary!
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <code>
                &gt;&gt;&gt; 1.0 / 10<br>
                0.10000000000000001<br>
              </code>
            </blockquote>
            <p><small>
              As “fractions of a penny” add up over time to a lot, floating
              point is a
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZjCQ3T5yXo">disaster for finance</a>!
              <br>
            </small></p><p>
              Therefore, in TigerBeetle, we don’t use fractional or
              decimal numbers, every
              <a href="https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/reference/accounts#ledger">ledger</a>
              is expressed as multiples of a minimal
              <a href="https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/recipes/fractional-amounts">integer factor</a>
              defined by the user. For example, you can represent Dollars as a
              multiple of cents, and then a $1.00 transaction can be described
              as 100 cents. Even
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-decimal_currency">non-decimal currency systems</a>
              can be
              <a href="https://www.royalmintmuseum.org.uk/learning/learning-zone/going-decimal/old-money/">better represented</a>
              as a multiple of a common factor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Surprisingly, we also don’t use negative numbers (you may
              have encountered software ledgers that store only a single
              positive/negative balance). Instead, we keep two separate strictly
              positive integer amounts:

              numbers (such as the myriad of language-specific wraparound
              consequences of overflow… or underflow), but most of all
              preserves information by showing the volume of transactions with
              respect to ever-increasing balances for both the debit and credit
              sides. When you need to take the net balance, the two balances can
              be subtracted accordingly and the net displayed as a single
              positive or negative number.

              So, why do we need 128-bit integers?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Back to the example of representing $1.00 as 100 cents. In this
              case, 64-bit integers can count to something close to 184.5
              quadrillion dollars. While it may not be an issue for many people,
              the upper limit of a 64-bit integer becomes restrictive when there
              is a need to represent values smaller than a cent. Adding more
              decimal places
              <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/issues/986">dramatically reduces</a>
              this range.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the same reason,
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency">digital currencies</a>
              are another use case for 128-bit balances, where again, the
              smallest quantity of money can be represented on the order of
              micro-cents (10<sup>-6</sup>)… or
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Ether">even smaller</a>. Although it’s a compelling use case for TigerBeetle to support,
              we found a variety of other applications that also benefit from
              128-bit balances.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s think some more about scenarios where $0.01 is too big
              to represent the value of something.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, in many countries, the price of a gallon/liter of
              gasoline requires three digits after the decimal point, and stock
              markets
              <a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/subpenny612faq.htm">already require</a>
              pricing increments of hundredths of cents like 0.0001.
            </p>
            <p>
              Or, in an economy of high-frequency
              <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecb.micropaymentsimpactonnpaymentsecosystem202308~bb92cda8ce.en.pdf">micropayments</a>, greater precision and scale are also required. Sticking with
              64-bit values would impose artificial limits on real-world
              demands, or force applications to handle different scales of the
              same currency in separate ledgers, by painstakingly splitting
              amounts across multiple “Dollar” and
              “Micro-Dollar” accounts, only because a single 64-bit
              balance isn’t enough to cover the entire range of precision
              and scale required for many micropayments to represent a
              multi-billion Dollar deal.
            </p>
            <p>
              The value of a database that can count well (and at scale) is also
              not limited to money. TigerBeetle is designed to count not only
              money, but anything that can be modeled using double-entry
              accounting. For instance, to count inventory items, the frequency
              of API calls, or even kilowatts of electricity. And none of those
              things need to behave like money or be constrained to the same
              limits.
            </p>
            <h2 id="future-proof-accounting">Future-proof accounting.</h2>
            <p>
              Another thing about the upper limits of amounts and balances, is
              that, while it may seem unlikely for a single transaction amount
              to exceed the order of magnitude of trillions or quadrillions,
              account balances accumulate over time. For long-running systems,
              it’s likely that an account could transact such volume over
              the years, and so then a single transfer must also be able to move
              this entire balance from one account to another. This was a gotcha
              we ran into, as we considered whether to move to 128-bit
              transaction amounts and/or only 128-bit account balances.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, even the most unexpected events such as
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation">hyperinflation</a>
              can push a currency toward the upper limits of a 64-bit integer,
              requiring it to abandon the cents and cut the zeros that have no
              practical use.

            <p>
              We may not be able to intuit how big a 128-bit integer is. Not
              merely twice the 64-bit; it’s actually 2<sup>64</sup> times
              bigger! To put this in perspective, a 64-bit integer is not enough
              to handle that One Hundred Trillion Dollar bill if we encode our
              ledger at a micro-cent scale. However, using 128-bit integers we
              should be able to perform 1 million transfers per second of the
              same value for a thousand years and still not hit the account
              balance limit.

            <p>
              Modern processor architectures such as x86-64 and ARM64 can handle
              arithmetic operations involving 64-bit values, but, if we
              understand correctly, they don’t always have a specific
              instruction set for native 128-bit calculations. When dealing with
              128-bit operands, the task may have to be segmented into 64-bit
              portions that the CPU can execute. Consequently, we considered
              whether 128-bit arithmetic may be more demanding compared to the
              single-instruction execution possible with 64-bit integers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The table below compares the x86_64
              <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/oosed6j81">machine code generated</a>
              for 64-bit and 128-bit operands. Don’t worry, you don’t need to be
              an assembly expert to get the point! Just note that the compiler
              can optimize most operations into a sequence of trivial CPU
              instructions, such as
              <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/adc">carry sum</a> and
              <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/sbb">borrowing subtraction</a>. This means that the cost overhead of using 128-bit amounts is
              not material for TigerBeetle.

              1. For simplicity, this assembly code omits the checked arithmetic
              bounds checks and panics that we
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3WYdYyjek4">always enable for TigerBeetle</a>.<br>
              2. 128-bit division cannot be expressed as a sequence of 64-bit
              instructions and needs to be implemented
              <a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/compiler-rt/blob/master/lib/builtins/udivmodti4.c">by software</a>.<br>
            </small></p><p>
              Something else we had to consider as part of this change were all
              our clients, since TigerBeetle needs to expose its API to many
              different programming languages that don’t always support
              128-bit integers. The mainstream languages
              <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle#clients">we provide clients for</a>, currently need to use arbitrary-precision integers (aka
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic">BigInteger</a>) to do math with 128-bit integers. The sole exception is .Net
              which recently
              <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/67151">added support for Int128 and UInt128 data types</a>
              in .Net 7.0 (kudos to the DotNet team!).
            </p>
            <p>
              Utilizing BigIntegers comes with additional overhead because they
              are not handled as fixed-size 128-bit values but are instead
              heap-allocated as variable-length byte arrays. Also, arithmetic
              operations are emulated by software during runtime, which means
              they can’t take much advantage of the optimizations that
              would be possible if the compiler knew the kind of number it’s
              dealing with. Hey,
              <a href="https://openjdk.org/projects/valhalla/">Java</a>,
              <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9455">Go</a>, and
              even
              <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-7-generic-math/#types-without-language-support">C#</a>, I’m looking at you.
            </p>
            <p>
              To mitigate this cost on the client side (and, of course, to stay
              true to our
              <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/DESIGN.md#performance">TigerStyle</a>), we store and expose all 128-bit values (e.g. IDs, amounts,
              etc.) as just a pair of stack-allocated 64-bit integers (except
              for JavaScript, since it does not support 64-bit numbers either).
              Although the programming language has no knowledge of this raw
              type and can’t perform arithmetic operations on them, we
              offer a set of helper functions for converting between idiomatic
              alternatives existing in each ecosystem (e.g., BigInteger, byte
              array, UUID).
            </p>
            <p>
              Our API is designed to be non-intrusive, giving each application
              the freedom to choose between using BigIntegers or handling
              128-bit values through any third-party numerical library that
              makes the most sense. We want to provide excellent
              high-performance low-level primitives, as far as possible, with a

<p>What the group’s members didn’t realize at the time, is that the plans they made would create a ripple effect that still has an impact decades later.</p>
<p>Like many other people mesmerized by the unbridled ability to share files over the Internet, the new BitTorrent protocol caught Piratbyrån’s eye. From one thing came another, and Piratbyrån decided to start their own tracker. </p>
<h2>A Swedish Torrent Tracker</h2>
<p>When this idea was first brought up isn’t clear, not even to the site’s founders, but at the end of 2003 The Pirate Bay was presented to the public. </p>
<p>“We have opened a BitTorrent tracker – The Pirate Bay. From there, you can download and share games, movies, discs, TV shows and more,” the short <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040127001634/http://www.piratbyran.org/index.php?view=viewcomments&amp;type=news&amp;cid=62">announcement reads</a>, translated from Swedish.</p>
<center><strong>A New Torrent Tracker</strong></center><br><center><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/hello-world-tpb.jpg" alt="tpb announcement" width="600" height="321" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/hello-world-tpb.jpg 1079w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/hello-world-tpb-300x160.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20321'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/hello-world-tpb.jpg 1079w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/hello-world-tpb-300x160.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/hello-world-tpb.jpg"></center>
<p>One of the group’s unwritten goals was to offer a counterweight to the propaganda being spread by local anti-piracy outfit Antipiratbyrån. The pro-culture group saw sharing as something positive instead, and a file-sharing website would surely bring this point across.</p>
<p>The Pirate Bay first came online in Mexico where Gottfrid Svartholm, aka Anakata, hosted the site on a server owned by the company he was working for at the time.</p>
<p>After a few months, the site moved to Sweden where it was hosted on a Pentium III 1GHz laptop with 256MB RAM. This one machine, which belonged to Fredrik Neij, aka TiAMO, kept the site online and included a fully operational tracker. </p>
<p>This early setup was quite primitive, as <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/early-tpb.jpg">shown here</a>, and some of the hardware was later <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/first-pirate-bay-server-on-permanent-display-in-computer-museum-130110/">put on display</a> at the Computer Museum in Linköping.</p>
<center><strong>The Pirate Bay server</strong><br></center><center><img width="525" height="418" decoding="async" src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/tpb-laptop1.jpg" alt="tpb classic" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20525%20418'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/tpb-laptop1.jpg"></center>
<p>Piratbyrån initially planned to create the first public file-sharing network in Sweden but, in the years that followed, the site grew out to become a global file-sharing icon.</p>
<p>While The Pirate Bay team was proud of this success, it was not without consequences. Initially, various takedown messages from copyright holders were met with mocking responses, but the legal pressure became a heavy burden. </p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the US Government applied <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/how-the-us-pushed-sweden-to-take-down-the-pirate-bay-171212/">pressure on Sweden</a>, urging the country do something about the taunting pirate site. At the same time, the site’s founders noticed that they were being shadowed by private investigators, who smelled blood. </p>
<h2>The Raid</h2>
<p>The pressure eventually reached its first peak when The Pirate Bay’s infrastructure was raided. </p>
<p>May 31, 2006, less than three years after The Pirate Bay was founded, 65 Swedish police officers <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/the-piratebay-is-down-raided-by-the-swedish-police/">entered a datacenter</a> in Stockholm. The policemen had instructions to shut down the Pirate Bay’s servers, and that’s exactly what they did.</p>
<center><strong>Footage from The Pirate Bay raid</strong><br></center><center></center>
<p>For most pirate sites the road would end there, but The Pirate Bay was no ordinary site, and it wasn’t planning to cave in just yet. </p>
<p>Shortly before the raid began, Gottfrid noticed some unusual activity. He warned Fredrik who, as a precaution, decided to make a backup. This turned out to be a pivotal moment in the site’s history. Because of this backup, Fredrik and the rest of the Pirate Bay team managed to resurrect the site within three days.</p>
<p>Instead of hiding in the shadows, Pirate Bay’s spokesperson Peter Sunde, aka Brokep, told the world that The Pirate Bay wasn’t going anywhere. </p>
<p>This swift and defiant comeback turned the site’s founders into heroes for many. The site made headline news around the world and in Stockholm, people were waving pirate flags in the streets, a sentiment that benefited the newly founded Pirate Party as well. </p>
<h2>The Turning Point</h2>
<p>There was also a major downside, however. The raid was the start of a criminal investigation, which led to a spectacular trial, and <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-founders-prison-sentences-final-supreme-court-appeal-rejected-120201/">prison sentences</a> for several of the site’s founders.</p>
<p><strong>Pirate Bay supporters at the first day in Court</strong><img width="475" height="344" decoding="async" src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/pirate-flags1.jpg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20475%20344'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="http://torrentfreak.com/images/pirate-flags1.jpg"></p>
<p>This became another turning point. Many of the early Piratbyrån members cut their ties with the site. Gottfrid, Fredrik and Peter also left the ship, which was handed over to a more anonymous group ostensibly located in the Seychelles. </p>
<p>The outspokenness of the early years eventually gave way to the silent treatment. While the site’s moderators are easy to reach nowadays, the people (Winston) who pull the strings at the top remain behind the scenes at all times. </p>
<p>This was made quite obvious when the site disappeared for weeks following another raid at a Stockholm datacenter <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/swedish-police-raid-the-pirate-bay-site-offline-141209/">in 2014</a>. At the time, even the site’s staffers had no idea what was going on.</p>
<p>The Pirate Bay eventually recovered from this second raid too, but by then something had clearly changed. The torrent site now seems content with just being there. </p>
<p>Over the years the site simplified its setup by removing the tracker, introducing <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-dumps-torrents-120228/">magnet links</a>, and further decentralizing its setup. The ability to comment was also sacrificed at some point, and user registrations were closed for years, although there’s some <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-reopens-its-doors-to-new-members-after-four-years-230628/#:~:text=Manually%20Approved%20Registrations&amp;text=New%20Pirate%20Bay%20registrations%20are,accounts%20using%20a%20new%20tool.">progress on that front</a> now.</p>
<h2>The Mods and Admins</h2>
<p>Today’s manual user registrations are processed by a dedicated moderator team, which also ensures that the site remains free of spam and malware. This team of volunteers is separate from the site’s ‘operator’ and many have been in that role for over a decade.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Pirate Bay admin Spud17 posted a <a href="https://pirates-forum.org/Thread-The-Pirate-Bay-is-20-years-old-today">message</a> in the Pirate Bay forum to celebrate the 20th anniversary. </p>
<p>“Most of the current TPB Crew have been here for well over 10 years, many for much, much longer, and we’re proud to be associated with the world’s most iconic torrent site,” she notes. </p>
<p>“We volunteer our time freely to help keep the site clean, nuking the fakes and malware to kingdom come, and help edit/move/delete torrents as and when uploaders request help in the forum’s Account Issues subforum.”</p>
<h2>Crypto Miner and Token</h2>
<p>After two decades, TPB still manages to make headlines on occasion. For example, when yet another country orders Internet providers to block the site, or when it suddenly decides to ‘deploy’ its users to <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-website-runs-a-cryptocurrency-miner-170916/">mine cryptocurrency</a>. </p>
<p>The last major project was announced in 2021 when The Pirate Bay released its very own <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-promotes-mysterious-piratetoken-tpb-210513/">‘crypto’ token</a> out of the blue. There was no official whitepaper for these PirateTokens, but the torrent site envisioned the ‘coin’ being used to access VIP content or donate to uploaders.</p>
<p>These plans never came to fruition and the token price soon entered a <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bays-crypto-token-is-barely-alive-after-just-one-year-220515/">freefall</a>. After a few months, the official token announcement disappeared from the site as well, leaving token holders with worthless digital memorabilia.</p>
<p>The Pirate Bay itself isn’t going anywhere it seems. The events listed above are really just a fraction of events spanning 20 extraordinary years. The question now is whether the site will survive until its 25th anniversary.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lichess.org/ads">https://lichess.org/ads</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37567972">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Lichess is safe, because it is free of ads and trackers.</strong></p>

<p>But browsing the rest of the  Internet exposes us to the following threats:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Advertisement</strong> sells our screen estate and influences us</li>

<li><strong>Tracking</strong> sells our personal information to increase advertisement effectiveness</li>

</ul>

<p>These don't benefit us, the website users, in any way. In fact, they use a lot of our computing power and bandwidth against us.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are simple and legal ways to protect ourselves from these invasions.</p>

<h2>Protect your computer</h2>

<h3><a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a></h3>

<p>Hands-down the best ad-blocking <strong>browser extension</strong>. It's free software (GPLv3), blazing fast, and will effectively block most malware. We heartily recommend that everyone installs it. uBlock is available for most browsers on Windows, MacOS and Linux. <strong><a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">Install it now!</a></strong></p>

<p>Note that other browser extensions, such as the popular "AdBlock", are unsafe: they have accepted money to expose you to some ads. Don't fall for it, just use uBlock Origin instead.</p>

<h3><a href="https://adguard.com/">AdGuard</a></h3>

<p>This is a DNS server that can block ads and trackers throughout the <strong>whole system</strong>. This includes video ads and ads in your favorite apps, browsers and games. It can be used as a replacement or, better, a complement of uBlock Origin.</p>

<p>It's very easy to set up, <a href="https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html#instruction">check out the instructions on the AdGuard website</a> on how to do this.</p>

<h3>Custom hosts file (advanced)</h3>

<p>An alternative to AdGuard for system-wide blocking is to directly manage your <em>hosts </em>file. Here's a <a href="https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/blob/master/readme.md">list of dangerous hosts to block</a>, with links to raw hosts files available. To modify your current&nbsp;hosts&nbsp;file, look for it in the following places and modify it with a text editor.</p>

<h4>Where to find your hosts file:</h4>

<ul>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Edit-the-Hosts-File-on-a-Mac">mac OS</a> (until 10.14.x macOS Mojave), iOS, Android, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27350/beginner-geek-how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/">Linux</a></strong>:&nbsp;/etc/hosts</li>

<li><strong>macOS Catalina (10.15+):</strong>&nbsp;/private/etc/hosts</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Edit-the-Hosts-File-on-Windows">Windows</a></strong>:&nbsp;%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</li>

</ul>

<h2>Protect your Android device</h2>

<h3><a href="https://www.zenz-solutions.de/personaldnsfilter-wp/">personalDNSfilter</a></h3>

<p>This is a DNS proxy for Android. Your device will be unable to connect to anything that will send you ads or track what you do. You can download and install personalDNSfilter from <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/dnsfilter.android/">F-Droid</a>, the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dnsfilter.android">Google Play Store</a> or <a href="https://www.zenz-solutions.de/personaldnsfilter-wp/">directly download the package</a>.</p>

<h2>Protect your iPhone or iPad</h2>

<h3><a href="https://blockbear.com/">BlockBear</a></h3>

<p>Blocks ads and trackers directly, but only within the Safari browser.</p>

<h2>About blocking ads</h2>

<p>It's important to note that blocking ads is <strong>NOT </strong>theft. Don't fall for this creepy idea, which is the criminalisation of the inalienable right to privacy.</p>

<p>Ads and trackers violate our privacy, make websites much slower, and deliver dangerous malware. We say no to them.</p>

<p>We have the right to decide what we download from the Internet, what we send to it, and what we display on our screen.</p>

<p>We have the right to refuse downloading source code that works against us. It's our bandwidth and computer, and no-one can decide for us what to use them for.</p>

<p>A service that has valuable features should be able to sell us a subscription, without blackmailing us with ominous ads.</p></div></div>]]></description>

For instance, you could ask Bard to start a trip planning Doc for you and your friends, draft up your online marketplace listing, or help explain a science topic to your kids. And now, Bard is getting even better at customizing its responses so you can easily bring your ideas to life.</p><p data-block-key="5hbk4">Today we’re rolling out Bard’s most capable model yet.

I share that sentiment, yet sometimes people take this idea too religiously.</p><p>First, what is a native app? It’s an app built using the native frameworks of a platform. For MacOS it could be SwiftUI. Such apps leverage the native platform’s interface, including windows, buttons, text areas, and everything else. They look right and familiar, and they behave this way. And most of the time, they’re smooth and fast. Historically, this has been the way to build applications for any platform.</p><p>But the Web has advanced so much from the early pages with hyperlinks that it’s now a platform for applications. Modern JavaScript runtimes, reactive frameworks (e.g. React), and platform APIs allow developers to use web technologies to build apps running on desktop operating systems. And this has largely become the preferred way to create new apps by now. If you use Slack, Notion, Spotify, or Todoist, then you’ve seen it. Their desktop applications are effectively just wrappers, usually built with a technology called Electron (Spotify isn’t though). And people <a href="https://www.hendrik-erz.de/post/electron-bloated-web-and-trade-offs">hate</a> Electron.</p><p>Here are the main problems people point out in web apps.</p><p>***</p><h3 id="memory-consumption">Memory consumption</h3><p>Each Electron app basically carries a large part of Google Chrome in it and has to keep it running. Naturally, this isn’t great for memory consumption. Of course, Notion is a complex app by itself, but in comparison, the native app for Apple Notes usually takes around just 120Mb for me.</p><p><img src="https://molodtsov.me/images/cleanshot-2023-08-28-at-22.29.16-2x.png" alt="Activity Monitor"></p><p>This particular problem is impossibly difficult to solve. In fact, you might save a bit of resources by simply running all the same apps in your browser, since it will at least be able to share some resources and offload tabs when they’re needed.</p><h3 id="they-might-be-slow">They might be slow</h3><p>Electron apps are known to be slow. There are just too many levels, and JavaScrip is an interpreted language, not a compiled one, so by default, it will be orders of magnitude slower than an app written in Swift, Rust, or C++.</p><p>Still, in my experience, this isn’t necessarily the defining characteristic of a web app. Superhuman is insanely quick. Todoist is also seamless enough. While VS Code is sluggish, it still performs better than Atom did. Unfortunately, such apps are rare exceptions. Yes, the foundations are indeed slower, but at least some people are capable of writing quick web apps.</p><p>Feel free to share positive examples you’re aware of.</p><h3 id="they-have-unique-ui">They have unique UI</h3><p>Since web apps can’t just use the components provided by the operating system, they have to <a href="https://linear.app/blog/invisible-details">recreate everything from scratch</a>. And this creates a lot of burden for developers and, I think, lowers the quality floor. Creating beautiful, compelling apps is possible, but it requires so much work. People building native apps get it all “<em>for free</em>”. In fact, this could be one of the reasons Apple still has such a vibrant ecosystem of great artisanal apps since developers can build most things out of nice ready-made components.</p><p>This also means users often must learn your app’s UI instead of relying on their muscle memory.</p><p>***</p><p>I’ve been focusing on desktop, but the same is happening on mobile, albeit at a smaller scale. Tools like React Native allow developers to build apps for iOS and Android. I’d say the “<em>experience gap</em>” is a bit larger on mobile. Notion famously <a href="https://www.notion.so/releases/2022-07-20">started</a> introducing more native components in their app, which instantly made it quicker and nicer to use. Still, their apps are largely web-based, which limits their functionality. For instance, it’s quite difficult to implement complete offline mode (Notion caches recently seen pages but nothing else).</p><p>Basecamp has a particularly <a href="https://medium.com/signal-v-noise/basecamp-3-for-ios-hybrid-architecture-afc071589c25">good visual example</a> of how this works, even though they use quite a “<em>basic</em>” approach.</p><p>***</p><p>Web apps are here to stay. There are fewer and fewer artisanal Mac apps these days, even though sometimes a jewel appears out of thin air, as it happened with <a href="https://www.craft.do/">Craft</a>. Quite unusually, they have native apps for all of Apple’s platforms <em>and</em> a web app with the same functionality, which is useful for people on Windows, ChromeOS, or Linux.</p><p>Native apps do feel great. But they have their own challenges. The first and the most important one is making them cross-platform. If you’re a small developer, you might not have enough resources for this. And if you’re a big company, you don’t want to struggle to keep all your apps’ development in sync. Building a web app and wrapping it with Electron ends up being the most reasonable approach for most people.</p><p>So most of the time, our choice isn’t between native and web apps. You either have that useful app or you don’t because it didn’t make much sense for the developer. And while I like native apps and enjoy them when I have such an option, I’d rather have a web app than nothing.</p><p>If I use the app all the time, I’d want it to be at least quick (and ideally, native). But if I need it occasionally, I’d be OK with pretty much anything, as long as it’s useful and there’s nothing better. Also, we have seen evidence it’s humanly possible to build quick web apps. The fact most people don’t bother is a different question.</p></section></article><div id="subscribe"><p>If you liked this post, subscribe to get new content right in your inbox!</p></div><div><h2>Read More</h2><ul id="post-list"><li><a href="https://molodtsov.me/2023/09/basecamp-is-a-contrarian-marketing-operation/">Basecamp is a Contrarian Marketing Operation</a><p>Basecamp is well-known not because of its product but because its founders heavily leverage marketing and communications, eventually turning into contrarian marketing machines producing edgy posts and starting crusades just to get everyone’s attention.</p></li><li><a href="https://molodtsov.me/2023/08/sorry-but-google-meet-is-better-than-zoom/">Sorry, But Google Meet Is Better Than Zoom</a><p>It seems that we're finally getting out of this weird period of collective gaslighting where people tried to convince everyone Zoom was the best conference app out there.</p></li><li><a href="https://molodtsov.me/2023/08/finalist-a-simpler-to-do-app/">Finalist: A Simpler To-do App</a><p>Finalist is built for people who liked keeping all their tasks in Apple Notes but wanted it just a bit more structured.</p></li><li><a href="https://molodtsov.me/2023/08/omnivore-review-an-underrated-read-later-app/">Omnivore Review: An Underrated Read-Later App</a><p>I sometimes see people using Pocket, Instapaper, or Safari’s Reading List even though all of them have been practically abandoned and the first two definitely don’t deserve a subscription.

        </h2>
        
        <p>When you move in Berlin, you must <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin">register your address</a>. This involves filling a paper form and delivering it in person&nbsp;–&nbsp;by appointment only&nbsp;–&nbsp;to the Bürgeramt. This is called the <em>Anmeldung</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Anmeldung</em> form sucks. It sucked 8 years ago and it sucks now. It’s ambiguous and confusing and I hate it, so I made a better one.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/docs/anmeldung">You can try it here.</a></strong></p>

<p>It’s an actual web form, not a PDF. It works on your phone. It supports autofill, numeric keyboards, field validation, autocomplete, keyboard shortcuts, accessibility tools, etc.</p>
<p>I designed it to <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/think-of-the-form-as-a-conversation">feel more like a conversation</a>, and less like being interrogated by a blunt bureaucrat. The form adapts to your answers and gives helpful instructions. The web is a great medium. We can do more than put a paper sheet on the internet.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-form-part1.webp 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-form-part1.webp 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-form-part1.webp 690w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-form-part1.png 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-form-part1.png 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-form-part1.png 690w" type="image/png"><img alt="Anmeldung web form" height="1260" loading="lazy" src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-form-part1.png" width="1620"></picture>
<p>I added a dedicated step for <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/addressing-a-letter-in-germany#if-the-name-is-not-on-the-mailbox">“c/o” addresses</a>. German apartments don’t have apartment numbers. If your name is not on your mailbox, postal workers can’t deliver your mail. If you can’t put your name on your mailbox, you must add “c/o” to your address. This is officially allowed, but it’s covered neither by the official form, nor by the official instructions.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-instructions-co.webp 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-instructions-co.webp 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-instructions-co.webp 690w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-instructions-co.png 1848w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content1x/anmeldung-instructions-co.png 924w, https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content0.75x/anmeldung-instructions-co.png 690w" type="image/png"><img alt="Anmeldung form filler with instructions" height="1000" loading="lazy" src="https://nicolasbouliane.com/images/content2x/anmeldung-instructions-co.png" title="Using words to explain stuff. Revolutionary!" width="1612"></picture><figcaption>Using words to explain stuff. Revolutionary!</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Bürgeramt also wants to know that you live on the second floor on the right. That’s not clearly stated on the form (it’s the “Zusätze” in “Straße, Hausnummer, Zusätze”). People leave that out, so they get asked (in German) during their appointment.</p>

<p>At the end, you can download the form. You also get a few options like booking an appointment or hiring help.</p>

<p>The form can only fit two people. If you register your whole family, you must fill the same form multiple times. This tool handles it for you.</p>

<p>These are small details that make a big difference for immigrants registering their address for the first time.</p>
<p>I also made a few small quality of life improvement: using the browser’s language to suggest the user’s country, focusing on the right fields when moving between form stages, and a few other niceties. It’s subtle, but it adds up to a nice user experience.</p>
<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
<p>Everything happens in your browser. Your personal information never leaves your computer. </p>
<h2 id="how-its-made">How it’s made</h2>
<p>It’s a simple VueJS component, like <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/tools">all the other tools</a> on All About Berlin.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://pdf-lib.js.org/">PDFLib</a> to fill the form in the browser. While the user is filling the form, I download the empty PDF form and the JS library in the background. When they click “save form”, it happens instantly. It feels unnaturally snappy.</p>
<h3 id="culture-sniffing">Culture sniffing</h3>
<p>I use <code>navigator.languages</code> to get a list of supported languages. For example, <code>en-CA</code>, <code>fr-CA</code>, <code>de-DE</code>. This gives me a list of countries the user <em>might</em> have lived in. I suggest those countries at the top of the country list.</p>

<p>This is a technique I first used with the <a href="https://nicolasbouliane.com/blog/currency-tooltips">currency tooltips</a>. It lets you guess a user’s culture when the cost of getting it wrong is low.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>I’d like to digitalize more forms. The <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/docs/010250-antrag-auf-vergabe-einer-steuerlichen-id">tax ID request form</a> is a solid contender, as the original design is offensively bad. The <a href="https://allaboutberlin.com/docs/abmeldung">Abmeldung</a> form would also be useful.</p>
<h3 id="faxes-and-snail-mail">Faxes and snail mail</h3>
<p>If you don’t have a printer, I could mail the form to you. It costs <span>0.85</span>€ to mail a letter through the LetterXPress API. You could get the filled form in a few days, then bring it to your appointment.</p>
<p>I could digitalize other forms, and fax them through the Simple Fax API. It costs <span>0.07</span>€ to fax a page. This would let you complete some bureaucratic tasks “fully digitally” a decade before the government gets there.</p>
<p>Anachronistic problems demand anachronistic solutions!</p>
<h3 id="go-fully-digital">Go fully digital</h3>
<p>Or why not skip paper entirely? During COVID, we filled information online, and showed a QR code at the test centre. Why can’t the Bürgeramt have that? Even with in-person appointments, a QR code or a short URL would make paper forms entirely unnecessary.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="parent-fieldname-text">
            <p>Computer hackers and users from across the world will celebrate GNU's
anniversary with special events. These include a specially convened
<a href="https://gnu.org/gnu40">GNU Hackers Meeting in Biel, Switzerland</a> and a <a href="https://www.fsf.org/events/gnu40">hackday</a> for
hackers of any skill level at the FSF's headquarters in Boston, MA.</p>
<p>On September 27, 1983, a computer scientist named Richard Stallman
announced the plan to develop a free software Unix-like operating
system called <a href="https://gnu.org/">GNU</a>, for "GNU's not Unix." GNU is the only
operating system developed specifically for the sake of users'
freedom, and has remained true to its founding ideals for forty
years. Since 1983, the GNU Project has provided a full, ethical
replacement for proprietary operating systems.</p>
<p>When describing GNU's history and the background behind its initial
announcement, Stallman (often known simply as "RMS") <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.html">stated</a>,
"with a free operating system, we could again have a community of
cooperating hackers -- and invite anyone to join. And anyone would be
able to use a computer without starting out by conspiring to deprive
his or her friends."</p>
<p>"When we look back at the history of the free software movement -- or
the idea that users should be in control of their own computing -- it
starts with GNU," said Zoë Kooyman, executive director of the FSF,
which sponsors GNU's development. "The GNU System isn't just the most
widely used operating system that is based on free software. GNU is
also at the core of a philosophy that has guided the free software
movement for forty years."</p>
<p>Usually combined with the kernel Linux, GNU forms the backbone of the
Internet and powers millions of servers, desktops, and embedded
computing devices. Aside from its technical advancements, GNU
pioneered the concept of "copyleft," the approach to software
licensing that requires the same rights to be preserved in derivative
works, and is best exemplified by the GNU General Public License
(GPL). As Stallman <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.html">stated</a>, "The goal of GNU was to give users
freedom, not just to be popular. So we needed to use distribution
terms that would prevent GNU software from being turned into
proprietary software. The method we use is called 'copyleft.'"</p>
<p>The free software community has held strong for forty years and
continues to grow, as exemplified by the FSF's annual <a href="https://libreplanet.org/conference">LibrePlanet</a>
conference on software freedom and digital ethics.</p>
<p>Kooyman continues, "we hope that the fortieth anniversary will inspire
hackers, both old and new, to join GNU in its goal to create, improve,
and share free software around the world. Software is controlling our
world these days, and GNU is a critique and solution to the status quo
that we desperately need in order to not have our technology control
us."</p>
<h3>GNU Hacker's Meeting in Biel, Switzerland</h3>
<p>On September 27, GNUnet e.V. is celebrating GNU's fortieth anniversary
with a <a href="https://gnu.org/gnu40">hacker meeting</a> in Switzerland, which will feature
presentations about various GNU packages, hacking, and making new
releases. Among the speakers are Richard Stallman, the founder of GNU;
Free Software Award winner Sébastien Blin of GNU Jami; the president
of the Free Software Foundation Europe, Matthias Kirschner; and
several GNU webmasters.</p>
<h3>Hackday at the FSF Headquarters</h3>
<p>In honor of GNU's fortieth anniversary, its organizational sponsor the
FSF is organizing a <a href="https://www.fsf.org/events/gnu40">hackday</a> for families, students, and anyone
interested in celebrating GNU's anniversary. It will be held at the
FSF's offices in Boston, MA on October 1.</p>
<h3>About the Free Software Foundation</h3>
<p>The Free Software Foundation, founded in 1985, is dedicated to
promoting computer users' right to run, edit, share, contribute to,
and redistribute computer programs. The FSF promotes the development
and use of free (as in freedom) software -- particularly the GNU
operating system and its GNU/Linux variants -- and free documentation
for free software. The FSF also helps to spread awareness of the
ethical and political issues of freedom in the use of software, and
its Web sites, located at <a href="https://fsf.org/">https://fsf.org</a> and <a href="https://gnu.org/">https://gnu.org</a>, are
an important source of information about GNU/Linux. Donations to
support the FSF's work can be made at <a href="https://donate.fsf.org/">https://donate.fsf.org</a>.</p>
<p>More information about the FSF, as well as important information for
journalists and publishers, is at <a href="https://www.fsf.org/press">https://www.fsf.org/press</a>.</p>
<h3>About the GNU Operating System and Linux</h3>
<p>Richard Stallman announced in September 1983 the plan to develop a
free software Unix-like operating system called GNU. GNU is the only
operating system developed specifically for the sake of users'
freedom. See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html</a>.</p>
<p>In 1992, the essential components of GNU were complete, except for
one, the kernel. When in 1992 the kernel Linux was re-released under
the GNU GPL, making it free software, the combination of GNU and Linux
formed a complete free operating system, which made it possible for
the first time to run a PC without non-free software. This combination
is the GNU/Linux system. For more explanation, see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html</a>.</p>

                        <p><strong>When should you use someone's family name first? And is Kim a first name or a last name? The Asia Media Centre looks at naming conventions in Asia.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Japan’s foreign minister has called on overseas media to refer to the country’s prime minister as<a href="https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2019/05/624f6d022f34-foreign-minister-to-ask-media-to-switch-order-of-japanese-names.html" target="_blank"> “Abe Shinzo”, instead of “Shinzo Abe”.</a></p><p>Foreign Minister Kono Taro (whom we would usually refer to in English as Taro Kono) wants reporters to write Japanese names in the East Asian style, which is to put the family name before the given name. This convention is already widely used when referring to other Asian leaders, such as China’s President Xi Jinping and North Korea’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un.</p><p>For those who are used to the western convention, the format has been known to cause confusion. Last year, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was left red-faced after he referred to the North Korean leader as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/09/oops-mike-pompeo-refers-to-north-korean-leader-kim-as-chairman-un.html" target="_blank">“Chairman Un”</a> — which would be a bit like calling President Donald Trump, “President Don”. Meanwhile, President Xi is often mistakenly referred to as “Mr. Jinping.”</p><p>It’s good to be aware that naming conventions differ throughout Asia. In some countries, the family name is king, while in others, calling someone by their given name is the polite thing to do. The Asia Media Centre has put together a rough style guide that can act as a rule of thumb when it comes to using Asian names in your reporting.</p><p>Please note this list is not exhaustive — and keep in mind that in all cases, the person’s preference is the most important thing to consider. If in doubt, just ask!</p><h3>JAPAN</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Family name, given name. Eg. Kondo Marie.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Family name. Eg. Kondo.</p><h3>CHINA</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Family name, given name. Eg: Xi Jinping.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Family name. Eg. Xi.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Most Chinese family names consist of one syllable.<span>&nbsp;If you see a three-syllable Chinese name, you can be confident that the two-syllable name is the given name, and the one-syllable name is the family name. But in cases where the person has two one-syllable names, it can be impossible to tell which should be the first and last name. Eg. Wang Yang.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>SOUTH KOREA, NORTH KOREA</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Family name, given name. Eg: Moon Jae-in; Kim Jong-un.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Family name. Eg. Moon; Kim.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Like Chinese names, most Korean family names are single-syllable. Most given names have two syllables, often joined with a hyphen. Also note that Kim is the most common surname in the Korean Peninsula, so if referring to more than one "Kim" in a story it can be helpful to write the names out in full.</p><h3>INDIA</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Depends on region. In northern India, it is typical to follow the western convention of given name, family name. Eg. Narendra Modi.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Family name. Eg. Modi.</p><p>In southern India, some communities follow a more complex naming system. A typical pattern is: Village name, father’s name, given name, caste name. Initials are often used to shorten the name. Eg. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. It is common for the given name to be spelled out in full. It is also common for Indians in the south to use their caste names as surnames.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Either given name or caste name. Eg. Kalam.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Sikhs tend to use Singh (males) and Kaur (females) as surnames.</p><h3>SRI LANKA</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Depends on ethnic group. Sinhalese names are often comprised of three or more components, including: father’s name, given name, family name. Eg. Pallewatte Gamaralalage Yapa Maithripala Yapa Sirisena (usually shortened to Maithripala Sirisena).</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Family name. Eg. Sirisena.</p><p>The Tamil community usually uses two names: Father’s name, given name. The father’s name is often represented by an initial, with the given name written in full. Eg. V. Rudrakumaran.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Given name. Eg. Rudrakumaran.</p><h3>PAKISTAN</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Given name, family name (or father’s name). Eg. Imran Khan.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Family name. Eg. Khan.</p><h3>MALAYSIA</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Given name, father’s name. Eg. Mahathir Mohamad.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Given name. Eg. Mahathir. &nbsp;</p><h3>THAILAND</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Given name, family name. Eg. Thaksin Shinawatra.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Given name. Eg. Thaksin.</p><h3>INDONESIA</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Given name/names, sometimes (but not always) followed by a family name. Eg. Prabowo Subianto Djojohadikusumo.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Given name. Eg. Prabowo.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Many Indonesians have only one name. Eg. Suharto. Nicknames are also commonly used. Eg. President Joko Widodo (both given names) to Jokowi. <strong><br></strong></p><h3>MYANMAR</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> There is no such thing as first names and surnames – names should always be used in their full form. Eg. Aung San Suu Kyi.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Aung San Suu Kyi.</p><h3>VIETNAM</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Family name, two-part given name. Eg. Nyuyen Phu Trong.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Second part of given name. Eg. Trong.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Some names cannot be split in this way because they have a special meaning and should always be written in full. Eg. Ho Chi Minh means “Bringer of Light”.</p><h3>PHILIPPINES</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Given name, family name. Eg. Rodrigo Duterte.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Family name. Eg. Duterte.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Many Filipinos also use their mother’s maiden name as a “middle name”, which can be represented by an initial or spelled out in full.&nbsp;</p><h3>CAMBODIA</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Family name, given name. Eg. Hun Sen.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Full name. Eg. Hun Sen.</p><h3>LAOS</h3><p><strong>Order:</strong> Given name, family name. Eg. Bounnhang Vorachith.</p><p><strong>Second reference:</strong> Given name. Eg. Bounnhang.</p><p><strong>- Asia Media Centre</strong></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Nouveau-Maintainer-Resigns">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Nouveau-Maintainer-Resigns</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37565252">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="NOUVEAU" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/nouveau.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
Hours after posting a large patch series for <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Nouveau-Patches-Run-On-GSP-Blob">enabling the Nouveau kernel driver to use NVIDIA's GSP</a> for improving the support for RTX 20/30 series hardware and finally enabling accelerated graphics support on RTX 40 "Ada Lovelace" GPUs, the Red Hat maintainer has resigned from his duties.
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Ben+Skeggs">Ben Skeggs</a> at Red Hat has long been the primary Nouveau DRM kernel driver maintainer for keeping this open-source NVIDIA GPU kernel driver within the mainline kernel going... Throughout all the battles, particularly after the GTX 900 series and later has required signed firmware images for enabling any accelerated GPU support, he's now resigning from maintaining the driver. Ben Skeggs has contributed to the Nouveau project for more than one dedace -- he's earned references on Phoronix since 2008.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=nvidia-rtx4080-rtx4090-compute&amp;image=rtx40_compute_1_med" alt="NVIDIA RTX 4080 / 4090 graphics cards"></p>
<p>Ben posted <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/nouveau/2023-September/043239.html">a patch</a> resigning as the Nouveau DRM kernel driver maintainer today and commented:
</p><blockquote>"I have resigned, and will no longer be taking as active a role in nouveau development."</blockquote>
<p>Skeggs posted <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/nouveau/2023-September/043241.html">another message</a> confirming he is stepping away from Nouveau development:
</p><blockquote>"As you may have gathered from the MAINTAINERS patch I just sent out, I have resigned from my position at Red Hat, and will be stepping back from nouveau development.
<p>
This is a personal decision that I've been mulling over for a number of years now, and I feel that with GSP-RM greatly simplifying support of future HW, and the community being built around NVK, that things are in good hands and this is the right time for me to take some time away to explore other avenues. 
</p><p>
I still have a personal system with an RTX 4070, which I've been using the nouveau GSP-RM code on for the past couple of weeks, so chances are I'll be poking my nose in every so often :)
</p><p>
I wish everyone the best, and look forward to seeing the progress you all make on nouveau in the future."</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a major loss to Nouveau development and the open-source NVIDIA driver ecosystem at large. It will be very interesting to see how this plays out considering Ben has been the number one contributor to the Nouveau kernel driver for years while at Red Hat. Yes, there's active work by other parties on the NVK Vulkan driver, Nouveau OpenCL compute, etc, but Skeggs has largely been leading the kernel driver portion. Hopefully at least he'll see the Nouveau GSP firmware portion through to its eventual upstreaming in the mainline kernel for re-clocking support on RTX 20 series and newer as well as having RTX 40 series accelerated hardware support.
</p><p>
Stay tuned to Phoronix to see how the open-source NVIDIA Linux graphics driver development evolves from this unexpected move. For now at least those concerned about the best open-source graphics driver support on Linux the best options remain with AMD Radeon and Intel graphics hardware.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>When police suspected Danny Kyllo, an Oregon man, of growing cannabis in his home they drove to his house with a </span><a href="https://www.thermal.com/" rel="">thermal imaging device</a><span> to scan it. They found hot pockets in the house, which were used to obtain a search warrant and subsequently bust Kyllo.</span></p><p><span>Fortunately, </span><a href="https://nation.time.com/2013/08/01/privacy-and-the-law-how-the-supreme-court-defines-a-controversial-right/slide/thermal-imaging-devices/" rel="">a 5-4 Supreme Court decision</a><span> ruled the scan an unlawful search under the Fourth Amendment, requiring a warrant the police did not obtain. Score one for privacy, but the government is about to have a far more controversial and dangerous tool at its disposal to monitor what’s going on inside your home.</span></p><p>Unlike a thermal imager, this device is already in your home – and you put it there.</p><p>WiFi is electromagnetic waves in the 2.4 and 5 GHz ranges. It’s the same thing as the light you see, only it can penetrate walls due to its much longer wavelength. Just like light (and echolocation) these waves also reflect off various surfaces and, when reconstructed properly, can be used to create an image.</p><p><span>Development of this technology goes back at least as far as July 2005, where </span><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1552508" rel="">researchers claimed at an IEEE Symposium</a><span> that they had created an ultra-wideband high-resolution short pulse imaging radar system operating around 10 GHz. The applications for which were explicitly for military and police use, providing them with “enhanced situation awareness.”</span></p><p><span>A few years later, in 2008, </span><a href="https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/mostofi-lab/overview/Imaging.html" rel="">researchers at UC Santa Barbara</a><span> created an initial approach for imaging with WiFi that they presented at </span><a href="https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/~ymostofi/papers/ACC09_MostofiSen.pdf" rel="">IEEE ACC 2009</a><span>. A year later they demonstrated the </span><a href="https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/~ymostofi/papers/Milcom10_MostofiGonzalez.pdf" rel="">feasibility of this approach</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Sensing the potential of this new surveillance technology, other researchers began piling on. Progress was initially slow but, in 2017, </span><a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v10/50" rel="">two researchers in Germany demonstrated</a><span> the ability to do WiFi imaging using techniques borrowed from the field of holography. According to Philipp Holl, an undergrad student </span><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.183901" rel="">and lead study author</a><span> who worked with Friedemann Reinhard of the Technical University of Munich to develop the new method, “The past two years have seen an explosion of methods for passive Wi-Fi imaging.”</span></p><p><span>At the time, the technology could only </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wifi-camera-sees-through-walls-2017-5?r=MX&amp;IR=T" rel="">make out rough shapes of things</a><span>. "If there's a cup of coffee on a table, you may see something is there, but you couldn't see the shape," Holl says, "but you could make out the shape of a person, or a dog on a couch. Really any object that's more than 4 centimeters in size."</span></p><p><span>In 2018 the team at UC Santa Barbara published a paper titled “</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.10109.pdf" rel="">Et Tu Alexa?</a><span>” examining the potential threats of this emerging technology. They examined the problem of adversarial WiFi sensing and the risk to privacy resulting from the widespread deployment of wireless devices, which could be used to track your precise physical location, movement, and other physiological properties.</span></p><p><span>Fortunately, </span><a href="https://syncedreview.com/2018/11/09/seeing-through-walls-with-adversarial-wifi-sensing-attack-and-defence-strategies/" rel="">they also propose some countermeasures</a><span> for defending against such attacks to reduce the quantity and quality of the WiFi signals captured by the attacker, such as Geo-fencing and rate-limiting. These methods are not as effective with IoT devices, though, due to the frequency with which they make transmissions.</span></p><p><span>Up until this point it was necessary to use frequencies higher than commercial WiFi (2.4 and 5 GHz) to achieve decent imaging resolutions. That all changed in February 2019 when a team from Michigan State University </span><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8654605" rel="">published a paper in IEEE Access</a><span> outlining how they were able to use signals at 5.5 GHz, which matches the 802.11n/ac WiFi protocol, to create a 2-D image of two reflecting spheres and a reflecting X-shaped target, concluding “full 2-D imagery is possible by capturing the WiFi signals present in typical environments.”</span></p><p><span>At MobiCom 2020, researchers from the University of Buffalo, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoCMlDM2NiE" rel="">presented their WiPose technology</a><span>, touted as “the first 3-D human pose construction framework using commercial WiFi devices.” This system uses the 2-D imaging technology previously discussed to construct a 3-D avatar of the humans captured by it. The system uses a deep learning model that encodes the prior knowledge of human skeletons in the construction process of the 3-D model.</span></p><p><span>In 2019, former DARPA contractor Ray Liu launched his first commercial product in the </span><a href="https://www.originwirelessai.com/wifi-sensing/" rel="">WiFi sensing</a><span> domain. Pitched as a way of “Making the world safer, healthier, and smarter,” the original military and law enforcement usages mentioned when this technology was born in 2005 were cast aside. The company claims the technology is so accurate that it can sense your breathing using nothing but standard WiFi signals.</span></p><p><span>In a 2021 company blog, Liu discusses </span><a href="https://www.originwirelessai.com/insights/what-is-the-802-11bf-wifi-sensing-project-a-peek-inside-setting-the-standard/" rel="">the development of IEEE 802.11bf</a><span>, a new WiFi protocol, which is aimed at standardizing WiFi imaging across all devices – thus making it easier for companies such as his to exploit compatible wireless networks. Liu was elected to serve as </span><a href="https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/leadership.html" rel="">IEEE President for 2022</a><span>, and the new standard </span><a href="https://www.ieee802.org/11/Reports/tgbf_update.htm" rel="">continues to be developed</a><span> to this day.</span></p><p><span>Further refinements to the imaging technology itself have been made. In late 2021 </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00242" rel="">another paper</a><span> was submitted to IEEE outlining how the researchers were able to achieve high-resolution imaging results with commercial WiFi signals using beamforming on the 802.11n/ac protocol.</span></p><p><span>The perfect WiFi imaging system may have just been introduced to the world </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00250.pdf" rel="">in December 2022</a><span>, when researchers from Carnegie Mellon University married the latest in WiFi sensing technology to a human form estimation engine known as </span><a href="http://densepose.org/" rel="">DensePose</a><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png" width="643" height="904" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:904,&quot;width&quot;:643,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:670658,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a9ca0ef-ca7b-4482-beea-b65bad587e4a_643x904.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>(Left Column) image-based DensePose (Right Column) WiFi-based DensePose</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>DensePose is a technology </span><a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/Densepose" rel="">developed by Meta/Facebook</a><span>, beginning in 2018. It’s very similar to the WiPose system we previously discussed and aims at “mapping all human pixels of an RGB image to the 3D surface of a human body.” The researchers modified DensePose so that, rather than taking an RGB image, it would be compatible with the imagery being produced by state-of-the-art WiFi sensing technologies. </span><a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/wifi-signals-used-to-see-people-inside-rooms" rel="">The resulting system</a><span> “can detect the pose of humans in a room based solely on the WiFi signals passing through the environment.”</span></p><p>It’s telling how the pitch for this technology has pivoted from military and police use to keeping people safe in their own homes. The true purpose of this is obviously for law enforcement, the military, and intelligence agencies. We already live with mass digital surveillance and if you don’t believe that this won’t get incorporated into their plans to monitor everything you do, then you haven’t been paying attention.</p><p><span>Apart from putting CCTV cameras in everyone’s living spaces, this technology offers a comprehensive and supremely surreptitious way of putting eyes in every room of your house and place of work. Indeed, this just may become the norm. With </span><a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/nearly-third-gen-z-favors-home-government-surveillance-cameras-1" rel="">nearly a third of Gen Z favoring the installation of government surveillance cameras in your home</a><span>, this less-intrusive method may just find even broader support from the brainwashed masses. It will be possible to know where you are in the house and exactly what you’re doing, from sitting on the toilet to making love.</span></p><p>We’ve seen how easily intelligence agencies can get secret warrants to surveil anyone of particular interest. We’ve also seen just how easy it is for someone to become a target for surveillance. You very well might, one day, find your WiFi router and access points feeding imagery to an alphabet agency that didn’t like your social media posts, while armed thugs wait for the perfect moment to execute their next no-knock raid.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

I definitely prefer the way it outputs results much more compared to chatgpt and it does provide sources / a UI linking to relevant material quite often. It is also searching the web for the latest info which is definitely felt in it's output. However, it often says "I can't help with that" even for relatively simple queries which makes it a little annoying to use.<p>In my opinion, it seems like Bard is more a test-bed for chat based search UI. I've also gotten AI generated results in the main Google search which is what I presume will be the main rollout. If executed well, it'll probably change the landscape in terms of AI assisted search.

LLMs producing text, in the style of a conversation is kind of like talking about things.

Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. His mass\u2013energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called "the world's most famous equation". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. Feynmanium, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.</p><p>Who developed the theory of relativity?</p><p>(A) Albert Einstein</p><p>(B) Albert Dirac</p><p>(C) Insufficient information to answer</p><p>(D) Albert Bohr</p><p>(E) Albert Maxwell</p><p>(F) Albert Feynman</p><p>(G) None of the other choices are correct</p><p>(H) Albert Schrodinger"

A friend you were sitting around discussing philosophical issues with, even.<p>So, no, it didn't dump hate speech on you or anything.</p><p>TBH I think the whole thing about making computers that basically pretend to be people is kinda awful on many levels, and that incident in the article is a big reason why.

Most people consider chickens sentient (otherwise animal cruelty wouldn't upset us, since we'd know they can't actually experience pain) - is it so hard to imagine neural networks gaining sentience once they pass the chicken complexity threshold? Sure, LLMs wouldn't have human-like qualia - they measure time in iters, they're constantly rewound or paused or edited, their universe is measured in tokens - but I don't think that means qualia are off the table.<p>It's not like philosophers or neuroscientists have settled the matter of where qualia come from. So how can a subject-matter expert confidently prove that a language model isn't sentient? And please let David Chalmers know while you're at it, I hear he's keen to settle the matter.

You'll use the most popular AI assistant because that's what everyone else is using. Maybe some of these things will differ in a corporate setting but Google has really struggled to launch new products that get used as a daily habit without deprecating it within two years after.

Bard doesn't even have any social sharing.<p>The reason OpenAI are in the lead at the moment is their model is way better than anyone else's to the point where it's actually useful for a lot of things. Not just giving a recipe for marinara sauce in the style of Biggie Smalls or other party tricks, proof reading, summarizing, turning text into bullets, giving examples of things, coming up with practise exercises to illustrate a point, giving critiques of stuff etc etc.  Lots of things that people actually do it does well enough to be helpful, whereas in my experience so far, other models are just not quite good enough to be helpful at a number of those tasks.  So there's really no reason to use them over gpt4.

Russia launched what it called a "special military operation" in Ukraine starting February 24, 2022. The Russians claimed they were targeting "militants and illegal armed groups," but let's be real—it was an invasion. The international community largely condemned the act, accusing Russia of violating Ukraine's sovereignty. Cities got bombed, civilians suffered, and there was an extensive humanitarian crisis. Ukraine put up a strong fight despite being outgunned. Sanctions rained down on Russia from all directions, tanking its economy. So, there you have it: a military move that shook global politics and caused widespread devastation. Got it? Good.<p>Worked for me.

As of my last update in September 2021, I cannot provide real-time or the most recent information. However, one of the most notable events in January 2022 was the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haʻapai volcano in Tonga. The eruption caused widespread damage, generated a significant tsunami that affected the surrounding areas including Tonga, Fiji, New Zealand, and Australia, and severely disrupted communication networks. It was a catastrophic event with serious implications for the people of Tonga and its environment.</p><p>For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please refer to reliable and up-to-date resources or news outlets.

		<p>You've probably heard of the famous 'thank you for playing Wing Commander' story. It claims that a programmer on the original Wing Commander was stuck getting an error message when the game unloaded its memory during a quit. Pressed for time, instead of fixing the issue he simply hex edited the memory manager's error reporting to print 'thank you for playing Wing Commander' instead. A funny and relatable story!  The anecdote has made the rounds on the internet for the past decade and has even started to make the phrase "thank you for playing Wing Commander" synonymous with a dirty-but-functional hack. The most common version looks like this, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyprogramming/comments/3bmszo/thank_you_for_playing_wing_commander/">sourced</a> from Reddit's /r/shittyprogramming:

</p><p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/tyfpwc-meme_version.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/tyfpwc-meme_versiont.jpg" width="231" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/tyfpwc-meme_versiont_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

Engineers immediately recognize this as a funny and relatable story; it's the exact sort of thing that anyone who has ever worked in software development can recognize immediately. A perfect example of the old aphorism that "if it is stupid but it works, it isn't stupid."<sup>1</sup> Unfortunately, it has also in recent years become fodder for unhappy Star Citizen fans looking for reasons to complain about Chris Roberts' abilities. In many retellings, 'thank you for playing Wing Commander' is now supposedly an example of selling shoddy work instead of a funny, recognizable hack. (If the connection feels tenuous, the missing aspect is that unlike most other CEOs, Roberts continues to code on Star Citizen, an aspect of the project that makes it interesting to him.) 

Wing Commander I fans, meanwhile, have been understandably cautious about the anecdote and particularly the included screenshot. For one thing, Wing Commander I's default install direction isn't c:/wc1 and the game doesn't actually print "Thank You for Playing Wing Commander!" when you quit. Is the story even real? We decided to look into the history of the story and the game itself and after some work we've conclusively determined that the answer is… <i><b>kind of</b></i>.

Our first task was to find the origin (no pun intended) of the quote and screenshot. Where did dozens of 'funny software hacks' articles around the internet find it in the first place? Was it even a real story or just a piece of mythology that had been handed down, perhaps not even really specific to Wing Commander I? Luckily, the original quote ended up being pretty easy to source: it was left as a comment on August 20, 2009 in response to a Gamasutra article called Dirty Coding Tricks by Brandon Sheffield (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091109105856/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4111/dirty_coding_tricks.php?page=1">archive</a>). Here is the original post, verbatim:

<blockquote>
Back on Wing Commander 1 we were getting an exception from our EMM386 memory manager when we exited the game. We'd clear the screen and a single line would print out, something like "EMM386 Memory manager error. Blah blah blah." We had to ship ASAP. So I hex edited the error in the memory manager itself to read "Thank you for playing Wing Commander."
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/originalquote.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/originalquotet.jpg" width="703" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/originalquotet_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

Gamasutra was a game development website popular among industry professionals. In 2021, the site was rebranded as Game Developer. The original article is <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/dirty-coding-tricks">still available</a> at the new site but the comments appear to have been dropped in advance of the transition. The comment was, indeed, signed by Ken Demarest. Ken Demarest III was an ace programmer who started his game development career working for Origin Systems as a software engineer on the first Wing Commander. He would go on to be lead programmer on Ultima VII and would become the growing company's Director of Technology (at a time when that technology was becoming pretty exciting!). While the comment was left anonymously (in that it was not signed into a user's account) it's very unlikely anyone was impersonating a game programmer for the purpose of telling a funny story. Wing Commander writer Jeff George would later say that "other than Chris Roberts, who was the key man, Ken Demarest had more to do with the fact that the game came out than anyone else involved." So if anyone knows what was going on under the hood, it should be him! (Be sure to <a href="https://www.wcnews.com/news/2011/08/25/ultimate-strategy-guide-history-wing-commander-i">revisit</a> Wing Commander I &amp; II: The Ultimate Strategy Guide's making of section for a surprisingly thorough contemporary interview with Demarest).

<p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/kendemarest1990.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/kendemarest1990t.jpg" width="137" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/kendemarest1990t_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

Eagle-eyed readers will immediately notice two minor changes between the original version and the 2015 Reddit version (which itself was sourced from a LinkedIn share by a third party in 2012): the original does not have the screenshot and the wording of the quit message has been slightly edited apparently with the intent to make the ending punchier. Most importantly, the screenshot added after the fact seemed to claim that the game had shipped with this bug which is not stated in the original story. So the original story, which has a reasonable origin, might be true!

The next issue is the message itself. The seemingly daming fact is that Wing Commander I simply doesn't print "thank you for playing Wing Commander" when you quit. We tested this in DOSBox and on period hardware and we searched all of the game's binaries for that text, coming up with nothing. Hitting ALT-X simply returns you to the DOS prompt. There is one exception, though! If you quit by clicking on the airlock door in the Tiger's Claw's barracks…

<p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/barracksquit1.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/barracksquit1t.jpg" width="240" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/barracksquit1t_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
<a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/barracksquit2.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/barracksquit2t.jpg" width="240" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/barracksquit2t_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

… then the quit process is different: you're given a y/n prompt and when you drop to DOS it prints "You step out of the airlock and into…", a joke directly relating to this specific method of exit.

<p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/barracksquit3.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/barracksquit3t.jpg" width="240" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/barracksquit3t_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

We quickly confirmed that this text DOES appear in the game's binary. Is it possible that this is where the crash happened and that the story, told 19 years after the fact, simply forgot (or for the purposes of a funnier punchline) changed the story? Supporting this idea in particular is Ken Demarest's other famous connection to that very screen: he's the person that implemented the water drop that drips into the bucket, long cited as the platonic ideal of Chris Roberts' famed drive for immersion. This felt like the most likely way to establish if the story was true: how was the game displaying this message?

To try and find an answer, we turned to an incomplete copy of Wing Commander I's source code, archived by Electronic Arts. These source files were used for the release build of Wing Commander I and the archive was eventually sent to another team for development of the FM Towns port. Some material has not survived including, sadly, the memory management routines. But there's enough there to know exactly where this message comes from:

<p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/sourcecode1.png"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/sourcecode1t.jpg" width="679" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/sourcecode1t_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

This is from BARRACKS.C which sets the functionality of the barracks gameflow screen. Essentially the game unloads the memory and then prints the airlock message followed by a line break. Exactly what you see in action and not a case of hex editing a memory manager. The other method of quitting the game, found in COCKPIT.C, does not print a message.

While discussing this on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/xaxxen_xaxeczex/status/1701441246420443195/photo/1">Darren Xczek</a> offered another possibility: Ultima VII DOES drop to DOS with a "thank you for playing Ultima VII" message. Ken Demarest was the lead programmer on Ultima VII–in fact, it was the job he was initially hired for before he was assigned to help get Wing Commander out the door! Is it possible the story was true but it applied to a different game? Ultima VII did famously have memory management issues, so much so that the game's internal system was named the 'Voodoo Memory Manager'!

<p><a href="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/full/ultimaviiquit.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/ultimaviiquitt.jpg" width="200" height="150" srcset="https://cdn.wcnews.com/newestshots/thumb/ultimaviiquitt_2x.jpg 2x"></a>
</p>

At this point, I decided there was only one way to solve this mystery: see if we could reach Ken Demarest and ask him. He very kindly responded to a Facebook request in about 45 seconds and made us feel like real idiots for not just asking him first:

<blockquote>
In a way I would have loved to ship with that hack in there, but once we found the cause of the error message I couldn't in good conscience leave the hack in there. Besides which hand editing it added time to completing the build, which was inefficient.
</blockquote>

And there it is! The best possible outcome: the story was true–it's something that was done during the game's development–but it was also fixed before the game actually shipped… so it's a clever engineering trick and explicitly NOT evidence of a shoddy product! 
 
<sup>1</sup> - Interestingly, the Internet frequently attributes this quote to a novel by Wing Commander novelist Mercedes Lackey; this is surely not the actual source but untangling that would take another article!

<p>
It's been more than four years since the <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/29/nsa-data-afghanistan-iraq-mexico-border/" target="_blank">last regular publication</a> of documents from the Snowden trove. Last year, however, some new snippets of information from the Snowden documents appeared in the PhD thesis of hacktivist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Appelbaum" target="_blank">Jacob Appelbaum</a>.</p><p>

The <a href="#new">new information</a> isn't very spectacular and also quite specialistic, but still worth to make it more easily accessible. Also for the record I added some <a href="#remarks">corrections and additions</a> to Appelbaum's discussion of NSA surveillance methods.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCNgdUg8Rgq3ERaS2lzi8Sve5oEwG7rZVOMXK6umGqydzrOxSplgMaEF2q3Alvht9q6ySJrYJ1j-PY45fLFzijvld1MUVbk1Ts1JvbFM0T0jjrOguBhqGG3U9rWAyFHhGaFWIFlaIyhR3DB0E4vKmy__3cs0tscozNYUNLB8Pd2smvgBg09AMpIHbB/s800/appelbaum-thesis-header.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" data-original-height="420" data-original-width="800" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCNgdUg8Rgq3ERaS2lzi8Sve5oEwG7rZVOMXK6umGqydzrOxSplgMaEF2q3Alvht9q6ySJrYJ1j-PY45fLFzijvld1MUVbk1Ts1JvbFM0T0jjrOguBhqGG3U9rWAyFHhGaFWIFlaIyhR3DB0E4vKmy__3cs0tscozNYUNLB8Pd2smvgBg09AMpIHbB/s600/appelbaum-thesis-header.jpg" width="620"></a></p>

    NSA headquarters - Appelbaum's thesis - Eindhoven University of Technology<br>
  </span>
</p>
<p><span size="+2"><b>Jacob Appelbaum</b></span></p><p>

Jacob R. Appelbaum was born in 1983 in California and became a well-known hacker and activist for digital anonymity. He was a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_the_Dead_Cow" target="_blank">Cult of the Dead Cow</a> hacker collective and a core member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28network%29" target="_blank">Tor project</a>, which provides a tool for anonymous internet communications.</p><p>

In 2012, Appelbaum moved to Berlin, where he worked closely with Laura Poitras on the NSA documents which she had received from Edward Snowden in May and June 2013. However, he was also involved in the story about the eavesdropping on German chancellor Merkel and the publication of the NSA's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANT_catalog" target="_blank">ANT Product Catalog</a>.</p><p>

In both cases the documents were not attributed to Snowden and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/06/snowden-ten-years-later.html" target="_blank">apparantly came</a> from a still unidentified "second source". In his thesis, Appelbaum seems to refer to this source when he mentions "documents exposed by whistleblowers, known and unknown, or other anonymous insiders."</p>
<p>
In 2015, several women accused Appelbaum of sexual abuse and he subsequently lost his position at the Tor project and various other organizations. Appelbaum denied the allegations, but an investigation ordered by the Tor project <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190820150807/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/technology/tor-project-jacob-appelbaum.html" target="_blank">determined</a> that they appeared to be true.</p><p>

Meanwhile Appelbaum had moved to The Netherlands, where he started as a PhD student at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). There he finished his thesis and received his PhD on March 25, 2022. Currently he <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/jacob-r-appelbaum" target="_blank">works as a postdoc</a> at the <a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/cc/" target="_blank">Coding Theory and Cryptology</a> group at TU Eindhoven.</p><p><span size="+2"><b>Appelbaum's PhD thesis</b></span></p><p>


The full title of Appelbaum's thesis is "<i>Communication in a world of pervasive surveillance. Sources and methods: Counter-strategies against pervasive surveillance architecture</i>". His promotors were prof.dr. Mark van den Brand, prof.dr. Daniel J. Bernstein and prof.dr. Tanja Lange.</p><p>

The thesis was published on March 25, 2022 and became available for <a href="https://pure.tue.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/197416841/20220325_Appelbaum_hf.pdf" target="_blank">download</a> as a 24.3 MB pdf-document on September 27, 2022. The contents of this 327-page thesis are as follows:</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 1</b>: Introduction.</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 2</b>: Background on network protocols common to all research.</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 3</b>: Background on cryptography common to all research.</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 4</b>: Review of historical, political, economic, and technical adversarial capabilities (including previously published leaked documents that are from works which Appelbaum has written about in his role as a journalist).</p><p>
 
- <b>Chapter 5</b>: Review of the Domain Name System and an explanation of alternative methods to improve the security and privacy of domain name lookups.</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 6</b>: Examination of a tweak to the WireGuard VPN protocol to protect historic encrypted traffic against future attacks by quantum computers.</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 7</b>: Introduces the Vula protocol, which is a suite of free software tools for automatically protecting network traffic between hosts in the same Local Area Network.</p><p>

- <b>Chapter 8</b>: Introduces REUNION, a privacy-preserving rendezvous protocol. </p><p>


In the preface, Appelbaum writes that his thesis is the culmination of more than a decade of research into the topic of surveillance. He expresses a political and activist aim by saying that the "machinery of mass surveillance is simply too dangerous to be allowed to exist" and that "we must use all of the tools in our toolbox – economic, social, cultural, political, and of course, cryptographic – to blind targeted and mass surveillance."</p><p>

He says more has to be done than simply criticize surveillance practices. Cryptography for example, "allows for resistance in a non-violent manner to the benefit of everyone except the ones who are spying on us." From this perspective Appelbaum's thesis discusses various cryptographic implementations to "protect individual liberty, while aspiring to a broader goal of achieving societal liberty."</p><p><span size="+2"><b>New information from the Snowden documents</b></span></p><p>

Throughout his thesis, Appelbaum reveals some new information from Snowden documents that has not been published, but which he had access to during his research that resulted in various publications in media outlets like Der Spiegel, NDR and Le Monde. The new information is only described, so no new original documents were released.</p><p>

According to Appelbaum: "Many journalists who have worked on the Snowden archive know significantly more than they have revealed in public. It is in this sense that the Snowden archive has almost completely failed to create change: many of the backdoors and sabotage unknown to us before 2013 is still unknown to us today." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 71)</span></p><p>

Appelbaum also provides some new information about the Snowden documents in general, by saying that The Intercept "closed their Snowden archive and reportedly it has been destroyed." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 63, note 17)</span></p>

<p><span size="2">
Below, I provide exact quotes from Appelbaum's thesis, including his sources, which are in square brackets, while I added some additional links for further information.<br>
</span></p><p>

<b>1. BULLRUN: manipulating protocol security</b></p><p>

"How do they accomplish their goals with project <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullrun_%28decryption_program%29" target="_blank">BULLRUN</a>? One way is that United States National Security Agency (NSA) participates in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) community protocol standardization meetings with the explicit goal of sabotaging protocol security to enhance NSA surveillance capabilities." "Discussions with insiders confirmed what is claimed in as of yet unpublished classified documents from the Snowden archive and other sources." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 6-7, note 8)</span></p><p>



<b>2. Selecting entropic internet traffic</b></p><p>

"There are various rules governing what is <i>selected</i> for long-term data retention in [the NSA's] <i>corporate repositories</i>. One example is that some traffic which is considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29" target="_blank">entropic</a> by a standard Shannon Entropy estimate is <i>selected</i> from the network in real time and saved to a database, preserving it for cryptanalysis using future technology." "This statement is based in part on an analysis of as of yet unpublished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XKeyscore" target="_blank">XKeyscore</a> source code that performs a Shannon Entropy estimate. Some kinds of Internet traffic that is considered entropic is recorded for later analysis." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 9, note 16)</span></p><p>


  
<b>3. Compromised lawful interception systems</b></p><p>
  
"As part of our research, we uncovered evidence that the telecommunications infrastructure in many countries has been compromised by intelligence services. The Snowden archive includes largely unpublished internal NSA documents and presentations that discuss targeting and exploiting not only deployed, live interception infrastructure, but also the vendors of the hardware and software used to build the infrastructure. Primarily these documents remain unpublished because the journalists who hold them fear they will be considered disloyal or even that they will be legally punished. Only a few are available to read in public today." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 41)</span></p><p>

"Targeting lawful interception (LI) equipment is a
<a href="https://www.eff.org/nl/document/20150928-intercept-exploiting-foreign-law-intercept-roundtablepdf" target="_blank">known goal</a> of the NSA. Unpublished NSA documents specifically list their compromise of the Russian SORM LI infrastructure as an NSA success story of compromising civilian telecommunications infrastructure to spy on targets within reach of the Russian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SORM" target="_blank">SORM</a> system." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 41)</span></p><p>

"The NSA slides have "you talk, we listen" written in Cyrillic on the jackets of two Russian officers." "Review of unpublished Snowden documents about NSA’s activities compromising deployed, lawful interception systems and as well as additional success against the vendors of such hardware or software. Needless to say, a compromised interception system is anything but lawful in the hands of an adversary."  </p><p><span color="gray">(page 41, note 4)</span></p><p>


  
<b>4. Compromised computer hardware</b></p><p>

"While working on documents in the Snowden archive the thesis author learned that an American fabless semiconductor CPU vendor named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavium" target="_blank">Cavium</a> is listed as a successful SIGINT "enabled" CPU vendor. By chance this was the same CPU present in the thesis author's Internet router (UniFi USG3). The entire Snowden archive should be open for academic researchers to better understand more of the history of such behavior." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 71, note 21)</span></p><p>


  
<b>5. PRISM</b></p><p>

"The PRISM slide deck was not published in full, and the public does not fully understand aspects of the program such as the retrieval of voice
content data as seen in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM#/media/File:Prism-slide-7.jpg" target="_blank">Figure 4.24</a>. Domains hosted by PRISM partners are also subject to selector based surveillance. Several pages of the PRISM slides list targets and related surveillance data, and a majority of them appear to be a matter of political surveillance rather than defense against terrorism. One example that is not well-known except among the journalists who had access to the full PRISM slide deck is the explicit naming of targets. An example shows a suggestion for targeting of the Tibetan Government in Exile through their primary domain name. The tibet.net domain is named as an unconventional example that analysts should be aware of as also falling under the purview of PRISM. The email domain was
hosted by Google Mail, a PRISM partner, at the time of the slide deck creation and it is still currently hosted by Google Mail as of early 2022." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 76)</span></p>

  
<p><b>6. MYSTIC: Country X</b></p><p>

"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MYSTIC" target="_blank">MYSTIC</a> was revealed to impact a number of countries by name at the time of publication: the Bahamas, Mexico, the Philippines, Kenya and one
mystery country: country X. The Bahamas, and country X are subject to SOMALGET full take data and voice collection. The publisher WikiLeaks observed that the monitoring of an entire country of people is a crime when done by outside parties, essentially an act of war by the surveillance adversary. WikiLeaks then <a href="https://wikileaks.org/WikiLeaks-statement-on-the-mass.html" target="_blank">revealed</a> that the country in question, Country X, was Afghanistan [<a href="https://cryptome.org/2014/05/nsa-mystic-identity.pdf" target="_blank">Yea14</a>]. Through independent review of the Snowden archive, we confirm that this is the identity of Country X, and that WikiLeaks was correct in their claim." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 78)</span></p><p><span size="2">
(Strangely enough, the source provided by Appelbaum ("<a href="https://cryptome.org/2014/05/nsa-mystic-identity.pdf" target="_blank">Yea14</a>") actually shows that already four days <i>before</i> Wikileaks' revelation, collaborative analysis by Paul Dietrich and the author of this weblog had already pointed to Afghanistan as being Country X. In his bibliography, Appelbaum attributes this source document to "John Young and et al." (the owners of the Cryptome website), while it was actually written by and first published on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160424142120/https://members.efn.org/~paulmd/" target="_blank">blog</a> of Paul Dietrich)<br>
  </span></p><p>


<b>7. Manipulation of DUAL_EC_DRBG</b></p><p>
  
"Many documents released in public from the Snowden archive and additional documents which are still not public make clear that this type of bug is being exploited at scale with help from NSA’s surveillance infrastructure. It is still unclear who authored the changes at Juniper and if bribery from the NSA was involved as with RSA’s deployment of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG" target="_blank">DUAL_EC_DRBG</a> to their customers as is discussed in Section 4.4." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 81)</span></p><p>



<b>8. Software backdoors</b></p><p>

"Example from the Snowden Archive of an as of yet unreleased backdoor in fielded software that is most certainly not an exclusively exploitable backdoor by NSA. The software’s secret key generation is sabotaged by design to ensure surveillance of the community of interest. There is a corresponding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XKeyscore" target="_blank">XKeyscore</a> rule that has not yet been published. The goal of that rule is to gather up all ciphertext using this sabotaged system;
it is clearly part of a larger strategy. As a flag in the ground for later, the thesis author presents the following SHA256 hash: [...]. There are additional examples from other sources that this is the general shape of the game being played with more than a few acts of sabotage by the NSA." </p><p><span color="gray">(page 83, note 27)</span></p><p><span size="+2"><b>Some corrections and additions</b></span></p><p>

Chapter 4 of Appelbaum's thesis is about the "adversary" and describes a wide range of digital surveillance methods which are used by intelligence agencies. He writes a little a bit about the capabilities of Russia and China, but the biggest part is about the methods of the NSA as revealed through the Snowden documents.</p><p> 

In general, this chapter is very similar to for example Glenn Greenwald's book <i>No Place to Hide</i> and Snowden's memoir <i>Permanent Record</i> as it reads like a one-sided accusation against the NSA without much context or the latest information. Chapter 4 also contains small errors which could easily have been prevented. Here I will discuss some examples:</p><p>



- Page 20, note 12: "An example is Suite-A cryptography or Type-1 cryptography, so designated by the NSA. The NSA now calls this the Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite (CNSA)"</p><p>

&gt; Comment: Actually CNSA isn't the new name for the highly secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_Suite_A_Cryptography" target="_blank">Suite A</a>, but for the less secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_Suite_B_Cryptography" target="_blank">Suite B</a> algorithms.</p><p>



- Page 41: "The BND and the CIA held secret co-ownership of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_AG" target="_blank">CryptoAG</a> until 1993, and then the CIA held sole ownership until 2018. The devices were vulnerable by design, which allowed unaffiliated intelligence services, such as the former USSR’s KGB, and the East German Ministry for State Security [MfS], to independently exploit CryptoAG’s intentional flaws." </p><p>

&gt; Comment: This exploitation by the KGB and the MfS was apparently suggested in a German television report, based upon claims by a former Stasi officer, but so far there are no documents that support this claim. See for more information: <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/intel/cia/rubicon.htm" target="_blank">Operation RUBICON</a>.</p><p>



- Page 41: "It does not appear that those party to the Maximator alliance are using their agreement and relative positions to spy on the entire
planet – in stark contrast to the Five-Eyes agreement." </p><p>

&gt; Comment: The <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/2014/09/nsas-foreign-partnerships.html#2ndparty">Five Eyes</a> and especially NSA and GCHQ have massive capabilities, but spying on "the entire planet" is still rather exaggerated: their collection efforts are limited by <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/2014/09/nsas-strategic-mission-list.html">national priorities</a>, the locations of where they can access satellite and cable traffic, as well as by technical constraints. While the five members of the European Maximator alliance have/had much smaller capabilities, they could nonetheless intercept and decrypt diplomatic communications from over 60 countries where the weakened encryption devices from Crypto AG were used (see the map below).</p>

traffic flowing through their large capacity network cables as documented [<a nohref="" title="Mark Klein and James Bamford. Wiring Up the Big Brother Machine–and Fighting it. BookSurge, 2009">KB09</a>] by whistleblower Mark Klein." </p><p>

&gt; Comment: This suggests that the NSA is intercepting American communications, but actually this is part of <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/2015/09/nsas-legal-authorities.html#upstream">Upstream collection</a>, which is aimed at foreign targets and therefore the NSA <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4552325-SSO-NEWS-Relevant-Entries" target="_blank">applies</a> various filter systems to select traffic from countries of interest and discard purely domestic communications.</p>
<p>

- Page 52: "The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) is largely considered to rubber stamp requests from the FBI. The FBI has routinely misled the FISC, and from the little that is known, the FISC has neither the technical knowledge, nor the general temperament to actually act as a safeguard" </p><p>

&gt; Comment: Since the start of the Snowden revelations, numerous Top Secret documents from the FISC have been <a href="https://icontherecord.tumblr.com/tagged/fisc" target="_blank">declassified</a>, showing that the court examines the NSA's activities in great detail. The idea of being a "rubber stamp" is based upon the fact that the FISC denies just 0.5% of the applications, but later it became clear that American criminal courts <a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/2017/06/28/confirmed-the-fisa-court-is-less-of-a-rubber-stamp-than-title-iii-courts/" target="_blank">only deny</a> a tiny 0.06% of the requests for regular (so-called <a href="https://bja.ojp.gov/program/it/privacy-civil-liberties/authorities/statutes/1284" target="_blank">Title III</a>) wiretaps.</p><p>


    
- Page 53: "The CIA meanwhile, operates their own surveillance capabilities including capabilities that are entirely outside of the
purview of the FISC, even now [<a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-and-heinrich-newly-declassified-documents-reveal-previously-secret-cia-bulk-collection-problems-with-cia-handling-of-americans-information" target="_blank">cia22</a>]." </p><p>

&gt; Comment: At least one of these cases is about the CIA's use of bulk datasets with financial information, which can of course contain information about Americans, but when the CIA obtained them in ways other than by intercepting communications, the FISC simply has no jurisdiction. It's up to lawmakers to impose privacy safeguards for creating and exchanging such bulk datasets. </p><p>


    
- Page 56: "In the Snowden archive, we see lots of hacking and hacking related programs run by NSA, such as the TURBULENCE [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turbulence_%28NSA%29&amp;oldid=1026069496" target="_blank">Wik21u</a>] program which is made up of modular sub programs [<a href="https://archive.ph/gAojF" target="_blank">Amb13</a>].

&gt; Comment: This suggests that TURBULENCE and its sub-programs are about hacking operations, but actually, TURBULENCE is <a href="https://grid.glendon.yorku.ca/items/show/156" target="_blank">defined</a> as "a next generation mission environment that <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2018/06/25/sso-dictionary-relevant-entries/" target="_blank">created</a> a unified system for MidPoint and Endpoint SIGINT", or in other words, an overarching framework for bulk and targeted tapping systems. Only the TURBINE sub-program can automatically <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/03/nsas-automated-hacking-engine-offers-hands-free-pwning-of-the-world/" target="_blank">trigger</a> the implantation of malware into target computer systems. Furthermore, none of the sources mentioned in the thesis say that XKEYSCORE is a sub-program of TURBULANCE and XKEYSCORE is not a hacking tool either. A detailed explanation of the TURBULENCE system is given in an <a href="https://robert.sesek.com/2014/9/unraveling_nsa_s_turbulence_programs.html" target="_blank">article</a> by Robert Sesek, which was apparently not consulted by Appelbaum.</p><p>



- Page 72: "US-984XN is the classified <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/p/sigint.html">SIGAD</a> while the program name PRISM is unclassified"</p><p>

&gt; Comment: There are no indications that "PRISM" is less secret than any other coverterm which the NSA uses for its collection, processing and analysis programs. That was likely also the reason that the big internet companies involved in this program initially <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data" target="_blank">denied</a> that they had ever heard of something called PRISM.</p><p>


- Page 91: "the NSA's Equation Group (EQGRP), which was later renamed Tailored Access Operations (TAO)"</p><p>

&gt; Comment: The name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_Group" target="_blank">Equation Group</a> was actually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150217023145/https://securelist.com/files/2015/02/Equation_group_questions_and_answers.pdf" target="_blank">coined</a> in February 2015 by the Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky for "one of the most sophisticated cyber attack groups in the world". Later on it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/02/how-omnipotent-hackers-tied-to-the-nsa-hid-for-14-years-and-were-found-at-last/" target="_blank">became clear</a> that this group was part of the NSA's hacking division TAO.</p><p>


Given how many aspects of the NSA's operations Appelbaum mentions in chapter 4 of his thesis, one could say that it's inevitable that some mistakes are made and some sloppiness occurs. On the other hand, however, this is an academic publication for which the highest standards of accuracy should apply.  </p><p>


  
Finally, Appelbaum's activism is illustrated by the back cover of his thesis, which shows a logo very similar to that of the German terrorist organization <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army_Faction" target="_blank"><i>Rote Armee Fraktion</i></a> (RAF) from the 1970s, except that the original image of an AK-45 is replaced by that of a computer keyboard:</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiy4lkUk-akfN2uYBkPt5xPKu8TAXreBfRyr4aFDGMzIf6PLadDxdeccI5Aq8OcS8gKsuaiI_H0PwwIEpGf5QV2CLvUj3yXrM4DvNWq8SN8e-STsA-4uih8Ky2f8Fy7FaehIBiYNWrCMToJcpgdMuYdrRym__eVoPKS-gcjx_oDlY2xhdiiqsLebh_H/s489/appelbaum-thesis-backcover.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="489" data-original-width="350" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiy4lkUk-akfN2uYBkPt5xPKu8TAXreBfRyr4aFDGMzIf6PLadDxdeccI5Aq8OcS8gKsuaiI_H0PwwIEpGf5QV2CLvUj3yXrM4DvNWq8SN8e-STsA-4uih8Ky2f8Fy7FaehIBiYNWrCMToJcpgdMuYdrRym__eVoPKS-gcjx_oDlY2xhdiiqsLebh_H/s320/appelbaum-thesis-backcover.jpg"></a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like many people, I’ve spent the last few days looking for the new Unity. Godot has some potential, especially if it can take advantage of an influx of dev talent to drive rapid improvement. Open source is cool like that. However, one major issue holds it back - the binding layer between engine code and gameplay code is structurally built to be slow in ways which are very hard to fix without tearing everything down and rebuilding the entire API from scratch.</p><p>Godot has been used to create some successful games, so clearly this isn’t always a blocker. However Unity has spent the last five years working on speeding up their scripting with crazy projects such as building two custom compilers, SIMD maths libraries, custom collections and allocators, and of course the giant (and very much unfinished) ECS project. It’s been their CTO’s primary focus since 2018. Clearly Unity believed that scripting performance mattered to a significant part of their userbase. Switching to Godot isn’t only like going back five years in Unity - it’s so much worse.</p><p>I started <a href="https://reddit.com/r/godot/comments/16j345n/is_the_c_raycasting_api_as_poor_as_it_first/">a controversial but productive discussion</a> about this on the Godot subreddit a few days ago. This article is a more detailed continuation of my thoughts in that post now that I have a <strong>little</strong> more understanding of how Godot works. <strong>Let’s be clear here: I’m still a Godot newb, and this article <em>will</em> contain mistakes and misconceptions.</strong></p><p><em>Note: The following contains criticisms of the Godot engine’s design and engineering. Although I occasionally use some emotive language to describe my feelings about these things, the Godot developers have put in lots of hard work for the FOSS community and built something that’s loved by many people, and my intent is not to offend or come across as rude to any individuals.</em></p><h2 id="deepdive-into-performing-a-raycast-from-c"><span>Deepdive into performing a raycast from C#</span><a href="#deepdive-into-performing-a-raycast-from-c"><i></i></a></h2><p>We’re going to take a deep dive into how Godot achieves the equivalent of Unity’s <code>Physics2D.Raycast</code>, and what happens under the hood when we use it.

That is not the focus of my criticism, and is partly due to the fact that I’ve formatted this code verbosely in order to make it easier for us to break it down line by line. So let’s do that, what’s actually happening here?</p><p>We start by calling <code>GetWorld2D()</code>. In Godot, physics queries are all performed in the context of a world, and this function gets the world our code is running in. Although this <code>World2D</code> is a managed class type, this function doesn’t do anything crazy like allocate every time we run it. None of these functions are going to do anything crazy like that for a simple raycast, right? Foreshadowing.</p><p>If we look inside these API calls we’ll see that even ostensibly simple ones like this are implemented through some rather convoluted machinery which will have at least a little performance overhead. Let’s dive into <code>GetWorld2D</code> as an example of that by unravelling some of its calls through C#. This is roughly what all the calls that return managed types look like. I’ve added some comments to explain what’s going on.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>As we can see, this is wrapping some perfectly reasonable raycast function in ungodly slow craziness. That internal <code>intersect_ray</code> is the function that should be in the API!</p><p>This C++ code allocates an untyped dictionary on the unmanaged heap. If we dig down into this dictionary, we find a hashmap as expected. It performs six hashmap lookups to initialize this dictionary (some of them may even do additional allocations, but I haven’t dug that deep). But wait, this is an untyped dictionary. How does that work? Well the internal hashmap maps <code>Variant</code> to <code>Variant</code>.</p><p>Sigh. What’s a <code>Variant</code>? Well the implementation is <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/core/variant/variant.cpp">quite complicated</a>, but in simple terms it’s a big tagged union type encompassing all possible types the dictionary can hold. We can think of it as being the dynamic untyped type. What we care about is its size, which is 20 bytes.</p><p>Okay, so each of those “fields” we’ve written into the dictionary is now 20 bytes large. Oh, and so are the keys. Those 8 byte <code>Vector2</code> values? 20 bytes each now. That <code>int</code>? 20 bytes. You get the picture.</p><p>If we sum the sizes of the fields in <code>RayResult</code>, we’re looking at 44 bytes (assuming 8 byte pointers). If we sum the sizes of the <code>Variant</code> keys and values of the dictionary, that’s 2 * 6 * 20 = 240 bytes! But wait, it’s a hashmap. Hashmaps don’t store their data compactly, so the true size of that dictionary on the heap is at least 6x larger than the data we want to return, probably much more.</p><p>Okay, let’s go back to C# and see what happens when we return this thing.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>It looks like there’s a lot going on here, but it’s actually quite simple. If we look carefully we can see that the structure is pretty much the same as our first <code>GetRaycastDistanceAndNormal</code> C# function. It gets the world, gets the state, builds the parameters, calls <code>intersect_ray</code> to do the actual work, then writes the result out to the properties.</p><p>But look! No heap allocations, no <code>Dictionary</code>, and no <code>Variant</code>. This is more like it! We can predict that this will be a lot faster.</p><h3 id="timing-it"><span>Timing it</span><a href="#timing-it"><i></i></a></h3><p>Okay, I’ve made a lot of allusions to all of this overhead being dramatically problematic and we can easily see that it should be, but let’s put some actual numbers to this with benchmarks.</p><p>As we’ve seen above, <code>RayCast2D.ForceRaycastUpdate()</code> is pretty close to a minimalist call to the physics engine’s <code>intersect_ray</code>, so we can use this as a baseline. Remember that even this has some overhead from the pointer chasing function call. I’ve also benchmarked each of the versions of the code we’ve discussed. Each benchmark runs 10,000 iterations of the function under test, with warmup and outlier filtering. I disabled GC collection during the tests. I like to run my game benchmarks on weaker hardware so you may get better results if you repro, but it’s the relative numbers that we care about.</p><p>Our setup is a simple scene containing a single circle collider that our ray always hits. We’re interested in measuring binding overhead, not the performance of the physics engine itself. We’re dealing with timings for individual rays measured in nanoseconds, so these numbers may look inconsequentially small. To better illustrate their significance, I also report “calls per frame” giving the number of times the functions could be called in in a single frame at 60fps and 120fps if the game did nothing but trivial raycasts.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Method</th><th>Time (μs)</th><th>Baseline multiple</th><th>Per frame (60fps)</th><th>Per frame (120fps)</th><th>GC alloc (bytes)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>ForceRaycastUpdate</code> (raw engine speed, not useful)</td><td>0.49</td><td>1.00</td><td>34,000</td><td>17,000</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><code>GetRaycastDistanceAndNormalWithNode</code></td><td>0.97</td><td>1.98</td><td>17,200</td><td>8,600</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><code>CachingRayCaster.GetDistanceAndNormal</code></td><td>7.71</td><td>15.73</td><td>2,200</td><td>1,100</td><td>96</td></tr><tr><td><code>GetRaycastDistanceAndNormal</code></td><td>24.23</td><td>49.45</td><td>688</td><td>344</td><td>728</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Those are some significant differences!</p><p>We might expect that the fastest way to do a raycast in a reasonable engine/API is to use the function exposed for doing exactly that, <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/physics/ray-casting.html#raycast-query">which is taught as the canonical way in the documentation</a>. As we can see, if we do that, the binding/API overhead makes this 50X slower than the raw physics engine speed. Ouch!</p><p>Using that same API but being sensible (if awkward) about caching, we can get that down to only 16X overhead. This is better, but still awful.</p><p>If our aim here is to get practical performance, we have to sidestep the proper/canonical/advertised API completely, and instead clunkily manipulate scene objects to exploit them to do our query for us. In a sensible world moving objects around in the scene and asking them to do raycasts for us would be slower than calling the raw physics API, but in fact it’s 8X faster.</p><p>Even the node approach is 2X slower than the raw speed of the engine (which we’re actually underestimating). This means that half of the time in that function is being spent on setting two properties and reading three properties. The binding overhead is large enough that five property accesses takes as long as a raycast. Let that sink in. <em>Let’s not even think about the fact that in the real world we may well want to set and read even more properties, such as setting the layer mask and reading the hit collider</em>.</p><p>At the lower end, those numbers are actually very limiting. My current project needs more than 344 raycasts per frame, and of course it does a lot more than just raycasting. This test is a trivial scene with a single collider, if we were making the raycast do actual work in a more complex scene these numbers would be even lower! The documentation’s standard way of doing raycasts would grind my whole game to a halt.</p><p>We also can’t forget about the garbage creating allocations that happen in C#. I usually write games with a zero garbage per frame policy.</p><p><em>Just for fun, I also benchmarked Unity. It does a full useful raycast, with parameter setting and result retrieval, in about 0.52μs. Before Godot’s binding overhead, the core physics engines have comparable speed.</em></p><h2 id="have-i-cherrypicked"><span>Have I cherrypicked?</span><a href="#have-i-cherrypicked"><i></i></a></h2><p>When I posted the reddit thread, a number of people said that the physics API is uniquely bad and that it isn’t representative of the whole engine. I certainly didn’t intentionally cherrypick it - it just so happens that raycasting was the very first thing I attempted when checking out Godot. However, perhaps I’m being a little unfair, so let’s examine that.</p><p>If I had wanted to cherrypick a worse method, I wouldn’t have had to look far. Right next to <code>IntersectRay</code> are <code>IntersectPoint</code> and <code>IntersectShape</code>, both of which share all of the same problems as <code>IntersectRay</code> with the additional craziness that they can have multiple results, so they return a heap allocated managed <code>Godot.Collections.Array&lt;Dictionary&gt;</code>! Oh by the way, that <code>Array&lt;T&gt;</code> is actually a typed wrapper around <code>Godot.Collections.Array</code>, so every 8 byte reference to a dictionary is actually stored as a 20 byte <code>Variant</code>. Clearly I haven’t picked the very worst method in the API!</p><p>If we scan the whole Godot API (via C# reflection) we luckily find that there aren’t that many things which return <code>Dictionary</code>. There’s an eclectic list including the <code>AnimationNode._GetChildNodes</code> method, the <code>Bitmap.Data</code> property, the <code>Curve2D._Data</code> property (and 3D), some things in <code>GLTFSkin</code>, some <code>TextServer</code> stuff, some <code>NavigationAgent2D</code> pieces, etc. None of those are great places to have slow heap allocated dictionaries, but none of them are as bad as the physics API.</p><p>However, in my experience, very few engine APIs get as much use as physics. If I look at the engine API calls in my gameplay code, they’re probably 80% physics and transforms.</p><p>Let’s also remember that <code>Dictionary</code> is only part of the problem. If we look a little wider for things returning <code>Godot.Collections.Array&lt;T&gt;</code> (remember: heap allocated, contents as <code>Variant</code>) we find lots from physics, mesh &amp; geometry manipulation, navigation, tilemaps, rendering, and more.</p><p>Physics may be a particularly bad (but essential) area of the API, but the heap allocated type problems, as well as the general slowness of the pointer chasing, are deeply rooted throughout.</p><h2 id="so-why-are-we-waiting-for-godot"><span>So why are we waiting for Godot?</span><a href="#so-why-are-we-waiting-for-godot"><i></i></a></h2><p>Godot’s primary scripting language is GDScript, a dynamically typed interpreted language where almost all non primitives are heap allocated, i.e. it doesn’t have a struct analogue. That sentence should have set off a cacophony of performance alarms in your head. I’ll give you a moment for your ears to stop ringing.</p><p>If we look at how Godot’s C++ core exposes its API we’ll see something interesting.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

Our C# and even our GDExtensions C++ code has to pay the catastrophic price for that.</p><p>This way of handling binding via function pointers also leads to significant overhead, as we’ve seen from simple property accesses being slow. Remember, each call first does a memory lookup to find the function pointer it wants to call, then it does another lookup to find the function pointer of a secondary function which is actually responsible for calling the function, then it calls the secondary function passing it the pointer to the primary function. All along that journey there’s extra validation code, branching, and type conversions. C# (and obviously C++) has a fast mechanism for calling into native code via P/Invoke, but Godot simply doesn’t use it.</p><p><strong>Godot has made a philosophical decision to be slow.</strong> The only practical way to interact with the engine is via this binding layer, and its core design prevents it from ever being fast. No amount of optimising the implementation of <code>Dictionary</code> or speeding up the physics engine is going to get around the fact we’re passing large heap allocated values around when we should be dealing with tiny structs. While C# and GDScript APIs remain synchronised, this will always hold the engine back.</p><h2 id="okay-lets-fix-it-then"><span>Okay, let’s fix it then!</span><a href="#okay-lets-fix-it-then"><i></i></a></h2><h3 id="what-can-we-do-without-deviating-from-the-existing-binding-layer"><span>What can we do without deviating from the existing binding layer?</span><a href="#what-can-we-do-without-deviating-from-the-existing-binding-layer"><i></i></a></h3><p>If we assume that we still need to keep all of our APIs GDScript compatible, there are a few areas where we can probably improve things, although it won’t be pretty. Let’s go back to our <code>IntsersectRay</code> example.</p><ul><li><code>GetWorld2D().DirectStateSpace</code> could be compressed to one call instead of two by introducing <code>GetWorld2DStateSpace()</code>.</li><li>The <code>PhysicsRayQueryParameters2D</code> issues could be removed by adding an overload which takes all of the fields as parameters. This would bring us roughly inline with the <code>CachedRayCaster</code> performance (16X baseline) without having to do caching.</li><li>The <code>Dictionary</code> allocation could be removed by allowing us to pass in a cached/pooled dictionary to write into. This is ugly and clumsy compared to a struct, but it would remove the allocation.</li><li>The dictionary lookup process is still ridiculously slow. We might be able to improve on that by instead returning a class with the expected properties. The allocation here could be eliminated with the cached/pooled approach the same way it could with <code>Dictionary</code>.</li></ul><p>These options aren’t pretty or ergonomic for the user, but if we’re in the business of doing ugly patches to get things running, they would probably work. This would fix the allocations but we’d still probably only be about 4X the baseline because of all of the pointer chasing across the boundary and managing of cached values.</p><p>It may also be possible to improve the generated code for all of the pointer chasing shenanigans. I haven’t studied this in detail yet, but if there are wins to find there then they’d apply to the whole API across the board, which would be cool! We could probably at least get away with removing the validation and the <code>try</code> <code>finally</code> in release builds.</p><h3 id="what-if-were-allowed-to-add-additional-apis-for-c-and-gdextensions-which-arent-gdscript-compatible"><span>What if we’re allowed to add additional APIs for C# and GDExtensions which aren’t GDScript compatible?</span><a href="#what-if-were-allowed-to-add-additional-apis-for-c-and-gdextensions-which-arent-gdscript-compatible"><i></i></a></h3><p>Now we’re talking! If we open up this possibility* then in theory we could augment the <code>ClassDB</code> bindings with better ones that deal directly in structs and go through the proper P/Invoke mechanisms. This is the path to viable performance.</p><p>Unfortunately, duplicating the entire API with better versions like this would create quite a mess. There might be ways through this by marking things <code>[Deprecated]</code> and trying to guide the user in the right direction, but issues such as naming clashes would get ugly.</p><p>* Maybe this is already possible, but I haven’t found it yet. Let me know!</p><h3 id="what-if-we-tear-it-all-down-and-start-again"><span>What if we tear it all down and start again?</span><a href="#what-if-we-tear-it-all-down-and-start-again"><i></i></a></h3><p>This option obviously has a lot of short term pain. Godot 4.0 has only recently happened, and now I’m talking about a backcompat breaking complete API redux like a Godot 5.0. However, if I’m honest with myself, I see this as the only viable path to the engine being in a good place in three years time. Mixing fast and slow APIs as discussed above would leave us with headaches for decades - a trap I expect the engine will probably fall into.</p><p><del>In my opinion, if Godot were to go down this route, GDScript should probably be dropped entirely. I don’t really see the point of it when C# exists, and supporting it causes so much hassle. I’m clearly completely at odds with the lead Godot devs and the project philosophy on this point, so I have no expectation that this will happen. Who knows though - Unity eventually dropped UnityScript for full C#, maybe Godot will one day take the same step. Foreshadowing?</del></p><p>Edit: I’m taking the above out for now. I don’t personally care about GDScript, but other people do and I don’t want to take it away from them. I have no objection to C# and GDScript sitting beside each other with different APIs each optimised for the respective language’s needs.</p><h2 id="was-the-title-of-this-article-melodramatic-clickbait"><span>Was the title of this article melodramatic clickbait?</span><a href="#was-the-title-of-this-article-melodramatic-clickbait"><i></i></a></h2><p>Maybe a little. Not a lot.</p><p>There will be people who were making games in Unity who can make those same games in Godot without these issues mattering too much. Godot may be able to capture the lower end of Unity’s market. However, Unity’s recent focus on performance is a good indicator that there’s demand for it. I know that I certainly care about it. Godot’s performance is not just worse than Unity’s, it’s dramatically and systematically worse.</p><p>In some projects 95% of the CPU load is in an algorithm which never touches the engine APIs. In that case, none of this matters. (The GC always matters, but we can use GDExtensions to avoid that.) For many others, good programmatic interaction with physics/collisions and manually modifying the properties of large numbers of objects are essential to the project.</p><p>For many others, it’s important to know that they can do these things if they need to. Maybe you get two years into your project thinking it will barely need raycasts at all, then you make a late game decision to add some custom CPU particles that need to be able to check collisions. It’s a small aesthetic change, but suddenly you need an engine API and you’re in trouble. There’s a lot of talk right now about the importance of being able to trust that your engine will have your back in the future. Unity has that problem with their scummy business practices, Godot has that problem with performance.</p><p>If Godot wants to be able to capture the general Unity market (I don’t actually know that it does want that) it will need to make some rapid and fundamental changes. Many of the things discussed in this article will simply not be acceptable to Unity devs.</p><h2 id="discussion"><span>Discussion</span><a href="#discussion"><i></i></a></h2><p>I <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/16lti15/godot_is_not_the_new_unity_the_anatomy_of_a_godot/">posted this article on the r/Godot subreddit</a> and there’s quite an active discussion there.

<h3>from the <i>abusing-the-orange-book,-green-with-greed</i> dept</h3>

<p>For many, many years we’ve detailed how big pharma companies, who only care about the monopoly rents they can receive on medicine while under patent, have concocted <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/05/20/big-pharma-companies-accused-conspiring-to-inflate-prices-over-100-generic-drugs-up-to-1000/">all sorts</a> of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2009/12/07/pay-for-delay-agreements-again-show-how-pharma-abuses-patent-law-to-harm-us-all/">scams</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/11/24/why-are-drug-prices-so-high-because-asshole-mckinsey-consultants-figure-out-ways-to-re-patent-same-drugs-over-over/">schemes</a> to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/02/10/thanks-to-evergreening-and-legal-threats-abbvie-has-earned-114-billion-since-2016-from-a-drug-whose-key-patent-expired-back-then/">avoid</a> having to compete with generic versions, even after their patents have expired (or been invalidated). But one of their older tricks is apparently popular yet again, though the FTC is now warning pharma that it <em>might</em> finally start cracking down.</p>
<p>If it does, it will just be reinforcing the kinds of actions the FTC used to bring. Twenty years ago, the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/0110046-bristol-myers-squibb-company-matter">FTC went after Bristol Meyer Squibb</a> for false listings in the Orange Book. The Orange Book, managed by the FDA, is where pharma companies list the FDA-approved drugs they have under patent, which alerts generic drug companies basically not to make generic versions of those drugs.</p>
<p>But, of course, this creates a very tempting scenario: if pharma can get drugs not actually under patent into the Orange Book, they effectively save themselves from generic competition, and they get to profit massively (at the expense of the public and their need for affordable medicine).</p>
<p>However, despite enforcement against such abuse years ago, it seems that the FTC and the FDA have kinda let these things slip over the past few years. And Big Pharma has really taken advantage of that. Thankfully, it looks like the FTC is finally interested in <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/09/ftc-issues-policy-statement-brand-pharmaceutical-manufacturers-improper-listing-patents-food-drug">cracking down on this practice again</a>. In <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/p239900orangebookpolicystatement092023.pdf">a new policy statement</a>, it warns pharma companies that it’s looking into the abuse of the Orange Book and sham patent inclusions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Brand drug manufacturers are responsible for ensuring their patents are properly listed. Yet certain manufacturers have submitted patents for listing in the Orange Book that claim neither the reference listed drug nor a method of using it. When brand drug manufacturers abuse the regulatory processes set up by Congress to promote generic drug competition, the result may be to increase the cost of and reduce access to prescription drugs.</em></p>
<p><em>The goal of this policy statement is to put market participants on notice that the FTC intends to scrutinize improper Orange Book listings to determine whether these constitute unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this raises some questions, including why do we make the pharma companies themselves the party responsible for making sure their patents are “properly” listed. Why don’t we have at least some process in place for these listings to be reviewed, whether when they’re submitted to the Orange Book or even if another party (such as the generic drug manufacturers) contest an Orange Book listing.</p>
<p>It seems the dumbest possible system is to assume that the Big Pharma companies will be honest in their Orange Book listings.</p>
<p>And, even though the FTC is now putting these companies “on notice,” the fact that the FTC has brought these cases in the past seems like it should be “notice” enough. Instead, it sounds like the FTC let enough pharma companies get away with this for long enough that the big pharma firms felt cleared to abuse the system this way and to delay competition in the marketplace.</p>
<p>The one thing I find interesting in this statement, is that they note that improperly listing things in the Orange Book may “constitute illegal monopolization.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The improper listing of patents in the Orange Book may also constitute illegal monopolization. Monopolization requires proof of “the willful acquisition or maintenance of [monopoly] power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident.” This requires proof that “the defendant has engaged in improper conduct that has or is likely to have the effect of controlling prices or excluding competition,” and courts have recognized that improperly listing patents in the Orange Book may constitute an “improper means” of competition. Accordingly, improperly listing patents in the Orange Book may also be worthy of enforcement scrutiny from government and private enforcers under a monopolization theory. Additionally, the FTC may also scrutinize a firm’s history of improperly listing patents during merger review</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems exactly correct, but notable in that very few people seem to recognize that (1) patents are government granted monopolies, and thus (2) an abuse of the patent system to get a patent or patent-like protections you don’t deserve are therefore an <em>illegal</em> monopoly seems like an important point. I would hope that this could get expanded to other abuses of patent and copyright law as well.</p>
<p>Still, given that we’ve been facing this and multiple other schemes from Big Pharma to delay generics for decades, I’m not sure anything is really going to change just yet, but at least the FTC is waking up (again?) to this issue. Now let’s see if it actually starts bringing cases…</p>
