    <div>
        <p>Many years ago, my favorite podcast was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Totally_Rad_Show?ref=birchtree.me">The Totally Rad Show</a>. It was a fun video podcast where the hosts reviewed movies, games, TV shows, and other general nerd stuff. The hosts were Jeff Cannata (who last year <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/jeff-cannata-is-the-podcasting-g-o-a-t/">I called the podcasting GOAT</a>), Dan Trachtenberg (who went on to direct 10 Cloverfield Lane and last year's Prey), and Alex Albrecht (who seems to have a nice life going, but is less in the public eye today).</p><p>Anyway, I linked to the show's Wikipedia page because the original episodes are no longer available to download from the official source (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110309024639/http://revision3.com/trs/">here's an archived version</a>). Happily, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TRSarchive?ref=birchtree.me">a kind soul</a> has recently uploaded many episodes to YouTube, but that's just lucky, and those aren't guaranteed to be eternal either.</p><p>Back in the day, you could stream shows like this, but more often than not you would download them and watch them locally. That's what I did, so I had every episode on my computer at one point, but I deleted each one when I was done with it. In retrospect, I wish I'd saved most of these episodes to an external drive.</p><p>This applies to other things as well. There are little internet videos from the pre-YouTube days that I think about and would love to see again, but can't. There are versions of songs that you can't get on streaming services. There are just some things I remember from years ago that I can't see again, and that's a shame.</p><p>Things on the internet <em>can</em> be forever, but you can't assume someone else will keep them going, especially when it's stuff like video, which costs real money to host. If you love something, try to get a local copy and store it on a hard drive you control.</p><p>For video content around the web, I highly recommend trying out <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?ref=birchtree.me">yt-dlp</a>, which is an astoundingly great command line tool for downloading video from most big sites.</p>

<h2 id="web-llm">Web LLM</h2>

<p><strong>Llama 2 7B/13B are now available in Web LLM!!</strong> Try it out in our <a href="#chat-demo">chat demo</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Llama 2 70B is also supported.</strong> If you have a Apple Silicon Mac with 64GB or more memory, you can follow the <a href="#instructions">instructions</a> below to download and launch Chrome Canary and try out the 70B model in Web LLM.</p>

<p>This project brings large-language model and LLM-based chatbot to web browsers. <strong>Everything runs inside the browser with no server support and accelerated with WebGPU.</strong> This opens up a lot of fun opportunities to build AI assistants for everyone and enable privacy while enjoying GPU acceleration. Please check out our <a href="https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm">GitHub repo</a> to see how we did it.</p>

<p><img src="https://webllm.mlc.ai/img/fig/pitts.png" width="100%"></p>

<p>We have been seeing amazing progress in generative AI and LLM recently. Thanks to the open-source efforts like LLaMA, Alpaca, Vicuna and Dolly, we start to see an exciting future of building our own open source language models and personal AI assistant.</p>

<p>These models are usually big and compute-heavy. To build a chat service, we will need a large cluster to run an inference server, while clients send requests to servers and retrieve the inference output. We also usually have to run on a specific type of GPUs where popular deep-learning frameworks are readily available.</p>

<p>This project is our step to bring more diversity to the ecosystem. Specifically, can we simply bake LLMs directly into the client side and directly run them inside a browser? If that can be realized, we could offer support for client personal AI models with the benefit of cost reduction, enhancement for personalization and privacy protection. The client side is getting pretty powerful.</p>

<p>Won’t it be even more amazing if we can simply open up a browser and directly bring AI natively to your browser tab? There is some level of readiness in the ecosystem. This project provides an affirmative answer to the question.</p>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>

<p>WebGPU just shipped to Chrome. You can try out the latest Chrome 113. Chrome version ≤ 112 is not supported, and if you are using it,
the demo will raise an error like <code>Find an error initializing the WebGPU device OperationError: Required limit (1073741824) is greater than the supported limit (268435456). - While validating maxBufferSize - While validating required limits.</code></p>

<p>Select the model you want to try out. Enter your inputs, click “Send” – we are ready to go!
The chat bot will first fetch model parameters into local cache. The download may take a few minutes, only for the first run.
The subsequent refreshes and runs will be faster. We have tested it on Windows and Mac, you will need a GPU with about 6GB memory to run Llama-7B, Vicuna-7B, and about 3GB memory to run RedPajama-3B.</p>

<p><strong>Some of the models requires fp16 support. To enable fp16 shaders, you will need to use the following instruction(<code>allow_unsafe_apis</code>) to turn on the support in Chrome Canary.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Install <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/">Chrome Canary</a>, a Chrome nightly build for developers.</li>
  <li>Launch Chrome Canary from terminal with the following command:
    <div><pre><code>/Applications/Google\ Chrome\ Canary.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome\ Canary --enable-dawn-features=allow_unsafe_apis
</code></pre></div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chat-demo">Chat Demo</h2>

<p>The chat demo is based on <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/">Llama 2</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-delta-v1.1">vicuna-7b-v1.1</a> model and <a href="https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/RedPajama-INCITE-Chat-3B-v1">RedPajama-INCITE-Chat-3B-v1</a> model. More model supports are on the way.</p>

The near-extinction of Indian vultures in the mid-1990s proved fatal for humans too, causing the mortality rate to rise by 4% in districts once populated by the birds.</p><figure data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure data-infographic-js="1"></figure><p>Vultures act as nature’s sanitation service. In India, their diet consisted largely of rotting livestock carcasses—numbering 30m a year in the cattle-revering country. A group of vultures can polish off a cow’s carrion in 40 minutes. Their strongly acidic digestive tracts destroy most germs.</p><p>Historically, vultures were widespread in India. But between the 1990s and early 2000s their numbers plummeted by more than 90%, from around 40m. The cause was diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory drug that farmers began using to treat their cattle. Though the drug was harmless to both cows and humans, birds that consumed animals treated with diclofenac suffered from kidney failure and died within weeks.</p><p>Without vultures, carcasses attracted feral dogs and rats. Not only do these animals carry rabies and other diseases that threaten humans, they are far less efficient at finishing off carrion. The rotting remains they left behind were full of pathogens that then spread to drinking water.</p><p>The abrupt demise of the vultures made it possible to quantify their impact on public health. A new working paper, by Eyal Frank of the University of Chicago and Anant Sudarshan of Warwick University, used a statistical method called “difference-in-differences” to compare changes in the death rate in districts with habitats well suited to vultures with those in less suitable places, just as diclofenac use took off.</p><p>In districts with vulture-suitable habitats, more people began to die just as diclofenac sales increased. The effect was greatest in urban areas with large livestock populations. The authors estimated that, between 2000 and 2005, the loss of vultures caused 500,000 additional human deaths.</p><p>“Keystone species” like the vulture hold ecosystems together. Conserving these animals should be a priority. They may not be cute or cuddly, but they are important.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p><small>illustrations: olivier heiligers</small></p></div><p>This article appeared in the Graphic detail section of the print edition under the headline "Carrion call"</p><div orientation="vertical" data-test-id="vertical"><div orientation="vertical"><figure><img alt="Xi’s failing model: Why he won’t fix China’s economy" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1684" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/16/21/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/32/42/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/48/63/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/64/84/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/96/126/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/128/168/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/256/336/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/360/473/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/384/505/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/480/631/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/789/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/834/1097/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/960/1263/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1096/1441/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1684/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/1873/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/1873/90/media-assets/image/20230826_DE_EU.jpg"></figure></div><div orientation="vertical"><h3 orientation="vertical">From the August 26th 2023 edition</h3><p orientation="vertical">Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents </p><a href="https://www.economist.com/printedition/2023-08-26" data-analytics="sidebar:weekly_edition"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M12 1c6.075 0 11 4.925 11 11s-4.925 11-11 11S1 18.075 1 12 5.925 1 12 1zm.142 4.5l-1.008 1.062c3.33 3.276 4.194 4.14 4.608 4.5-1.602-.018-3.168-.018-10.242-.018v1.584c7.074 0 8.73 0 10.242-.018-.432.36-1.314 1.206-4.608 4.536l1.008 1.044 6.354-6.354L12.142 5.5z" fill="#2E45B8" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></g></svg><span>Explore the edition</span></a></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks" id="incArticle"><p>Close aerial combat is a game of fractions of a second, quick decision-making, and squeezing every ounce of performance out of fighter aircraft. Perceive. Analyze. Decide. React. Variations of this chain of events are taught at all stages of a fighter pilot’s career.</p><p>Some air forces have painted ‘false canopies’ on the bottoms of their combat aircraft in an attempt to confuse adversaries. Debate rages about the effectiveness of such attempts to mislead. I can tell you unequivocally that it <em>does</em> sometimes work – and that I almost died one day as a result.</p><p>On a day like any other, I sat in a briefing for a 2v1 (two versus one) Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM) training flight. I was feeling pretty good – my CF-18 Hornet basic course was going well, and I had moved beyond the basics of flying the jet to learning how to fight with it. This was a solo, where I would fly as the wingman to my instructor, Mike Hoch. Another instructor was to fly as our adversary (the bandit).&nbsp;</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A pair of Canadian Hornets takeoff on a training mission. Credit: RAF-YYC/wikicommons </span></figure><p>The lesson to be learned involved having one fighter engage the bad guy in close combat, while the other fighter maneuvered to get free of the fight, then turn back in and attack the bad guy from a bit further away. In close aerial combat, it was often difficult to get a shot in at the other aircraft. Both aircraft are turning very hard and doing everything to deny the adversary a valid shot, whether it was with a missile or with the gun. The fighter that was ‘free’ was usually the one who got a valid shot away first.</p><p>Since this was a ‘canned’ training scenario, the bandit sat in on the whole briefing, to make sure that we would get the most training out of every set-up. Throughout the Hornet basic course, every pound of jet fuel was spoken for, and there was little margin for making mistakes and wasting fuel. I’d been thoroughly indoctrinated in the ‘fuel is life’ school of thought, in much the same way as we saw speed as life.</p><p>There were to be some offensive set-ups, where we attacked the bandit from a position of advantage, then some defensive where he would attack from behind, and finally some neutral set-ups where we’d merge head-on. To ensure I saw both aspects, the bandit was told each time which fighter I was in. Some set-ups I was ‘engaged,’ while some I was ‘free.’</p><p>Sounds simple?&nbsp;</p><p>Well, it’s not.&nbsp;</p><p>Each fight was very dynamic, happening in three dimensions. One big change from fighting the CF-5 Freedom Fighter was that dogfighting usually involved vertical turning fights. These were egg-shaped, larger at the bottom and tighter at the top (due to gravity), and sometimes canted at an angle from the vertical toward the horizon. The main tactic was to draw the bandit into a ‘single-circle’ fight, meaning that one aircraft was chasing the other around the circle. Ideally, the friendly aircraft would be chasing the bandit, keeping him predictable but not in immediate danger of being shot by the bandit.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A CF-18 breaks away from its leader. Credit: RCAF </span></figure><p>Each was doing their damnedest to shoot or avoid getting shot. The instructors thoroughly enjoyed these flights, because they could exercise their own best Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM), while still providing training to me, the student. One of the biggest lessons we were supposed to glean from this was the longer you got wrapped up in a turning fight, the more chance somebody from outside the fight would take a shot and kill you.</p><p>On what turned out to be the last engagement on that flight, I was getting confident. Things had gone really well so far, both as free and engaged. As was standard before each engagement, we made quick ready calls.</p><p>“Tango Two, ready with 5,000.” Fuel quantity checks and confirmations were always made in training before each engagement. In afterburner (AB), a Hornet can burn about 1,000 pounds of fuel each <em>minute</em>. From where we were flying, about 50 miles north of Cold Lake, Alberta, we needed to stop fighting when we had 3,500 lbs remaining, so we could make it back to base with the minimum of 2,000 lbs remaining. I made a mental note that I had at most one and a half minutes of fuel in AB before I had to stop (knock it off). In training, unlike real combat, when we reached certain fuel remaining, we stopped fighting and went home, no questions asked.</p><p>My instructor and I flew a side-by-side formation, separated by about 2 miles. We met the bandit head-on, and he immediately got engaged with my lead. My job was to fly away from the fight, out of their ‘plane of motion’ (the circle they were turning in), then come back, figure out who was who, and shoot the bad guy. Things were complicated by the fact that we were all flying the same type of aircraft, and there was no way to tell which was which visually.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">CF-18s and their false canopies in view. Credit: RCAF </span></figure><p>I pulled up and away from their turning fight, selecting AB, and climbed as I accelerated. Glancing over my shoulder, I could see a tight turning fight developing. My instructor gave me short, concise radio calls, effectively a play-by-play of the fight, so that when I came back to shoot I’d quickly identify and shoot the bandit.</p><p>“I’m defensive. Nose high. Bandit is low man.” All calls that told me which he’d be when I turned back and had a clear view of the fight. They looked about the right distance behind me (about three miles). Time to go shoot the bandit and save my lead’s butt. I quickly did a ‘split s’ (flipped onto my back and pulled the nose down to loop back toward them).&nbsp;</p><p>I craned my neck, looking way back in my bubble canopy, to spot the other two Hornets. By now I was so used to pulling six or seven Gs that I barely felt any discomfort. I was completely focused on what I needed to do, and not thinking about minor things like physical pain as I was crushed into my ejection seat in the turn. The other fighters were just visible, albeit as two tiny specks high up in my canopy and behind. I made a small adjustment in the angle of my wings to put my ‘lift vector’ (an imaginary arrow coming up out of my canopy) on them. As the distance closed slightly between us, I could just pick up what I thought was a false canopy on the belly of one Hornet.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">An appreciation of what air combat really looks like. I took this photo a few years after the events in this story. My wingman in the blue circle is another CF-18 flying over Germany, three miles away. The red circle is around a Luftwaffe F-4 Phantom, pulling up to attack. He is also about two miles away. The wing shape and smoke trail make identifying the F-4 easy. With my eyes (better perception than the camera), I could see his belly (no canopy), indicating he was turning away from me. </span></figure><p>Okay. They’re turning away from me, and I’m coming around behind them. Sweet. From the latest radio calls, I knew that my lead was the one in front, so I continued pulling hard to point at the bandit. With my left thumb, I toggled the radar into boresight acquisition mode, meaning that it would lock on whatever I pointed at, then selected AIM-9M missile mode with the weapons select switch on the stick. All of these actions were done by reflex without looking inside – the Hands-On Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) being very well designed for air fighting while keeping my eyes out of the cockpit.</p><p>Satisfied that the geometry would work, I thought about my fuel quantity. I’d been burning jet fuel at a huge rate for a while now, and I wanted to make sure I was okay. The fuel gauge was down by my left knee on the instrument panel, so I flicked my eyes briefly down into the cockpit while keeping my head canted back. Moving my head under that G load would have seriously hurt my neck muscles.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A CF-18 in full afterburner.

Satisfied with my fuel quantity, I let my eyes flit back up, expecting to see the tails of the two aircraft turning away. I was momentarily confused as I saw in my Head-Up Display (HUD) that my radar had indeed locked onto the bandit, but instead of showing an expected valid shot, it displayed a ‘break X’ – meaning he was too close to shoot.&nbsp;</p><p>While my mind struggled to process the HUD’s symbology, I was shocked to see my lead flash by me, opposite direction, very, <em>very</em> close. Instinctively, I slacked off my turn and snapped my head to the left to watch him go by. My ‘spidey senses’ tingled, too late.&nbsp;</p><p>Like a spectator at a tennis match, my head snapped back to the right, just in time to see the trailing aircraft (the bandit) go by, even closer than my lead had. My aircraft rocked violently in the wake turbulence behind his hard-turning jet as he passed me.</p><p>“Knock it off, knock it off” came a terse radio transmission from my lead. I responded “Two, knock it off” and the other aircraft said “Bandit, knock it off.” A brief pause, and my lead said “Let’s call it a day. Two, rejoin echelon left, Bandit, you’re cleared off for RTB (return to base).” Shakily, I turned back toward my lead and rejoined on him..&nbsp;</p><p>We flew back to base in silence.&nbsp;</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A pair of RCAF CF-18s refueling, their false canopies clearly visible.

Today, though, I was immersed in my thoughts, and went through the motions of landing and unstrapping. The groundcrew who took over my jet must have found me to be uncharacteristically moody.</p><p>I looked at my instructor when I joined him at the servicing desk. Clearly, he was not ready to talk, especially in a crowded room with maintenance personnel everywhere. Nothing was said as we signed in our aircraft and we walked over to the Air Combat Manoeuvring Range/Instrumentation (ACMR/I) building together, in silence. Our aircraft had internal telemetry pods installed inside the gun door (forward left fuselage), which passed precise location and flight data down to ground receivers and recording systems back at base. By the time we got to the ACMR/I debrief room, the contractor who ran the system had it all set up to play back. There were large screens on which our aircraft were represented as simple 3D drawings.The flight data included distances between aircraft were constantly displayed and updated.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">An ACMR/I graphic from the era I was on the Hornet course.

I had seen this system being used with F-15s training at Luke AFB in Phoenix Arizona in 1981, courtesy of Major Dave Bashow, a CF-104 Starfighter pilot on exchange with the USAF. Seeing a debrief on ACMR/I was still quite impressive in 1986. Today, however, the cool factor was lost on me. I was still trying to process having nearly collided and died less than an hour ago.</p><p>In the Cold Lake debriefing room, the two instructors looked at each other, as if a silent question were being asked. The bandit nodded and Mike Hoch said “Let’s start with playback of the last engagement.” Shortly, we saw the single-circle fight develop, with my aircraft ‘spitting out’ to the west, then turning back toward them. That’s when I finally understood what had happened. When I turned back in toward them, they were not turning away from me – they were turning <em>toward</em> me.&nbsp;</p><p>Mike said “Run it back about 20 seconds. Switch to cockpit view from number Two (my aircraft).” The operator complied and soon we were seeing the view out of my cockpit, as I pulled back hard toward them. From my cockpit, the wire frame aircraft (about three miles away) could be seen turning, but the direction of turn was not evident since they were far away, and tiny.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A view of the CF-18's false canopy.

From two miles away, it is impossible to tell. </span></figure><p>I remembered how I had looked way back above my head to spot them, then glanced inside to check the fuel quantity. As my cockpit view was played back in real time, I saw how quickly the two other aircraft approached, and could see exactly how my glance inside came at a crucial time when I failed to recognize they were approaching, and not turning away.</p><p>How did I get fooled? I had seen the real canopies, but thought they were the false ones. As I turned toward them, I had failed to notice that their turn was taking them closer to me than I ever imagined.</p><p>“Freeze!” said Mike. “Let’s see how close we came.” After playing back in slow motion, and seeing both near-collisions, we figured out that I had missed my lead by 400 feet, head-on, and came within 150 feet of the bandit who was trailing. Our closing speed was about 900 kts, or roughly 1,700 kph. Imagine trying to fly within 150 feet of another aircraft, head-on, while travelling at such speeds!</p><p>Clearly, the false canopy fooled me. In other engagements over several years similar false canopy illusions were evident, but I was now more aware of how tricky they could be. Yes, in some cases opponents gained a slight advantage due to my hesitation, but at least I didn’t come close to a mid-air collision again. Flying against other allied fighters, we sometimes heard them express how our false canopies had fooled them. For sure, a false canopy cannot help against a missile or gunfire, but it was another tool in our arsenal when we needed it the most – close combat.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">False canopy on a Italian Navy AV-8B+ Harrier.

<p>The conventional venture capital funding path – from raising an institutional Seed, Series A, B, C, D, E, etc, all the way to exit via IPO – has long been treated as gospel. Its verses are most heavily preached by VC board members, whose business model it also supports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there is an influential tide of founders on the rise that is opting out of this path and quietly plotting a new one that leads to building generational companies.</p>



<p>It’s a hybrid path, combining the growth of targeted venture funding with the durability found in bootstrapping (i.e. profitability). It’s a path with less venture capital and more self-reliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it’s the direct result of founders emerging from a tumultuous period of feast (with 5x more venture capital offered to startups over the past decade) and a brief flirtation with famine from the recent pullback that has left some venture-dependent companies in starvation mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For many founders, a steady reliance on venture capital, as it is heavily prescribed today, is often seen as unhealthy, if not risky.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Increasingly, these founders are seeking freedom from the risk and control of the perpetual pursuit of venture capital. Instead, they’re ready to reroute their time, efforts, and attention to building enduring companies on their own terms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These founders are choosing to raise less and build more.</p>











<p>“<strong>Foie gras” venture capital&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The clearest trend in the venture industry over the past decade is VCs offering startups more money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To gain visibility into this trend, we can examine the ratio of VC capital raised to new startups in any given year. An imperfect but close proxy for viable new startups is the annual number of Seed deals (inclusive of Angel, Pre-Seed, and Seed deals). When you take total VC dollars raised, divided by the number of new companies, you’ll see the average startup today has 5x more VC capital available than its counterpart did in 2013:</p>

<p>The primary driver of this trend is VCs increasing their fund sizes, particularly larger firms. Nearly every single major fund has implemented this change. No other strategy has been so universally adopted.</p>



<p>As a result, every single type of round, from Seed to Series C on, has also increased in size. Here are some averages over time:</p>

<p>While 2023 will likely prove to be a down year for total VC capital raised, both the average and median fund size will remain up. The average fund size went from $336M in 2020 to $386M in 2022 to $538M in 2023 (PitchBook). The trend has become the new baseline.</p>











<p><strong>More isn’t always better&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Why is this trend so pervasive?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Do today’s startups need more money?&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Well, no.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main driver of a startup’s burn is salaries. Salaries over time have increased, but not by 5x (the rate VC capital has increased). Even the new increased infastructue costs with AI will ultimately come down as companies scale and the industry matures. None of this justifies the rate and breadth of this capital increase from VCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contrary to popular myth, statistically venture backed startups aren’t staying “private longer,” either. Between 2011 and 2021, the median time from venture funding to IPO exit in the US has fluctuated between 5 and 7 years, with no visible increase in time (Statistica 2023).&nbsp; Granted, SPACs may have impacted these numbers, but it’s nonetheless interesting that the data does not align to the myth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Do bigger funds perform better?</em></p>



<p>Again, no.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smaller funds consistently outperform large funds (on a multiple basis). More on this, below.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Does giving a startup more capital make it reliably perform better?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Another no. There is no conclusive data to support this. There is no empirical study that I know of that suggests that raising more capital increases a startup’s odds of success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking at case studies, for every Stripe ($8.7B raised), there are countless startups who raised too much and did not make it. To avoid speaking ill of the dead or the fatally wounded, I’ll withhold names (the headlines will tell this story).</p>



<p>The lack of conclusive evidence seems to have had little impact on the VC bias that startups – as a general rule – should raise more VC capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consider some of the more persuasive funding conventions prescribed by VCs:</p>



<p><em>If you can, raise more capital as opposed to less capital&nbsp;</em></p>



<ul>
<li>For founders, the case for more capital is easy to hear – hire faster, be offensive, save for a rainy day. But too much capital, especially too early, can depress urgency and innovation, all while contributing to unnecessarily high headcount and burn. These can be company killers. For every Figma, who raised a large but not unreasonable Seed round (for its time), there is a Seed company that raised that mega round (read $10M), which may do them more harm than good. Once you’ve raised for multiple years of runway, including hiring well and adding a buffer budget, what is any extra capital really doing? Who is that mega round really serving?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p><em>Raise at every round, or when you have explosive growth&nbsp;</em></p>



<ul>
<li>For many founders, taking on regular capital can be extremely valuable, as can taking on capital for hyper growth. But for startups that are already profitable and growing, raising can be a costly distraction. It can swallow founder time during company-making moments, resulting in potential loss of discipline, premature hiring, and unnecessary spending. It also can alert competition, hinder hiring (via ‘less attractive’ stock options), impact dilution, and potentially even affect board composition. Companies like Vanta chose to delay Series A to focus on building instead of raising, with others raising their huge Series As at the ‘standard’ time, because they ‘should,’ before fading into history. You have to wonder – how many of those momentum Series A companies would still be around if they just chose to build (profitably) instead of raise?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p><em>Prioritize growth over profitability to achieve outlier success</em></p>



<ul>
<li>For many founders, opting for growth over profitability has clear advantages: you can hire more, build more, market more; in short you can be generally more offensive. But for founders with the goal of creating a sustainable and durable business, prioritizing profitability growth over growth-at-all costs makes more sense. During a time when VCs were fawning over him, Ivan at Notion famously told investors that he’d “prefer to raise from his customers” as opposed to taking outside capital. Countless high-potential startups would still be around today if they had the same discipline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>No doubt more venture capital can help, but it can also certainly hurt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>VCs sell a product to founders. That product has ballooned over time in ways so that it can now potentially do harm. Like any other consumers, it falls to the founders of the companies to understand what they’re buying, and why it’s being sold in a particular way.</p>











<p><strong>Foolproof rich</strong></p>



<p>Here are the economics and incentives of the VC funds and why funds tend to grow over time.</p>



<p>The bigger the fund size, the more GPs get paid. A typical venture fund has a 2% management fee, paid <em>irrespective of performance</em> and based on fund size, and 20% carry, based on return of capital.</p>



<p>Consider this simplified model:</p>



<ul>
<li>A $100M fund which does 4x earns the GPs $80M ($60M in carry, plus $20M in management fees)</li>



<li>A $1B fund which does 1.5x earns the GPs $300M ($100M in carry, plus $200M in management fees)</li>
</ul>



<p>A large, poorly performing fund (1.5x) pays its GPs dramatically more than a smaller, higher performing (4x) fund. Stunningly, the large fund GPs would earn dramatically more on simple management fees alone (i.e. even if the fund was 0x, the GPs earn $200M). Granted, the $1B fund may have more GPs, but the payout differential is eye opening.</p>



<p>Further, smaller funds historically achieve higher returns than larger funds. For example, funds with $200M in AUM (assets under management) or less have an average top decile IRR of 62% over that last 10 years (2010-2020), versus funds with $1B-10B with an average top decile IRR of 27% (PitchBook). That’s more than a 2x difference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a larger fund, GPs are opting into a model that will likely yield poorer returns, but certainly pay them more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Across investment management, the larger the AUM, the lower (yet hopefully more stable) the returns, the more management tends to be paid. It’s not controversial, but it does have implications for founders:</p>



<p>When that large, multi-stage VC offers you a term sheet with 2x the capital than all the other term sheets – pause.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That larger sum of capital might be the right thing for your company, or it might not be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it is certainly the right thing for that VC’s business model.&nbsp;</p>











<p><strong>Raise less, build more</strong></p>



<p>After watching their peers fall victim to excess (from too much capital) and more recently to starvation (from too little VC capital with the recent pullback), more founders are questioning the wisdom of the current conventional venture funding path.</p>



<p>Instead of treating venture as a default, founders are going back to first principles and asking new questions:</p>



<p>What, exactly, is the right fundraising strategy for <em>my</em> company? What options exist?</p>



<p>Today, there is a growing common awareness amongst founders that a VC-only path can put them out of business, from either too little capital or pressure to take too much capital. If their company doesn’t exist, the chance of success is zero. On the other hand, if they are constrained by just profitability, they might not be able to build what they need to build, or others can outrun them. Bootstrapping alone can also impede.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve had similar conversations with dozens of founders on this topic, and I’m seeing them quietly start to pursue a new path – one that doesn’t perfectly fit within the lines prescribed by Sand Hill Road.</p>



<p>They are seeking to combine the growth of targeted venture funding with the durability found in bootstrapping (i.e. profitability).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their goal is to build a viable business <em>first</em>, while also harnessing the growth, network, and brand benefits of strategically raising capital from top investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a new hybrid path, and one that maximizes their odds of survival <em>and</em> breakout success.</p>



<p>Bootstrapping ethos encourages becoming profitable early, or having a path to profitability – which makes it more likely a company will stick around independent of venture capital. While targeted venture brings appropriate capital for growth as well as access to the networks and brand signals brought by top investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Practically, these new principles are translating into the following tactics:</p>



<ul>
<li>Raising a seed round with the primary aim of becoming profitable (as opposed to the primary aim of raising a Series A)</li>



<li>Raising a venture round from a top fund, gaining one top board member, but from there, opting out of raising a series of rounds</li>



<li>Raising smaller, disciplined amounts of capital, or delaying raises if the company is profitable and growing well</li>
</ul>



<p>In the past, some of these tactics were seen as controversial, if not renegade. Going forward, I see a groundswell movement and eventual wide-scale practice of this approach. We’ve already seen standout companies over the past 15 years – including Notion, Zapier, and Vanta to name a few – implement portions of these tactics to great success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More startups will adopt this approach as they come to understand its advantages, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>A more disciplined, focused culture: </em>Operating with financial constraints instills a culture of fiscal literacy and responsibility throughout the organization. It also primes creativity and inventiveness.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><em>A sharper, more coordinated product</em>: To keep customers paying, companies must keep customers delighted. A mandate to generate compounding revenue sustains pressure on product teams to listen to their users, understand the wider market, and craft a beloved product. It also forces product and engineering teams to work in concert with sales, marketing, and support on a common goal.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><em>More control, ownership, and upside: </em>Founders will likely retain authority on everything from company decisions to exit scenarios. For example, less capital creates less of a preference stack for founders and employees on M&amp;A exits; it’s also more likely to ensure founder control of the exit decision, including whether to go public.</li>
</ul>



<p>It yields all these benefits without sacrificing the growth and value brought by VC funds.</p>



<p>Founders who choose to raise less are liberating themselves from the venture hamster wheel, and in the process, are giving themselves more power to build generational companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In short, the “raise less, build more” approach empowers founders to be builders again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that makes for better products, better teams, and better, more valuable, companies.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>A few weeks ago, I was part of a talk at DEF CON 31 called <a href="https://forum.defcon.org/node/245742">The Hackers, The Lawyers, and the Defense Fund</a>. I was asked to share my experience receiving a legal threat for good-faith security research from my classmates.</p><p>This story has been told before (e.g., by my <a href="https://saligrama.io/blog/post/firebase-insecure-by-default/">classmate Aditya</a> who was also involved and by the <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2022/11/01/opinion-fizz-previously-compromised-its-users-privacy-it-may-do-so-again/">Stanford Daily</a>), but I wanted to share my talk here for posterity.</p><p>The following is an approximate transcript. I’ve added a few links and cleaned up some of the language for clarity.</p><h2 id="the-hack-itself">The hack itself</h2><p>Hey everyone! I’m going to briefly share my experience receiving a legal threat for good-faith security research, and then I’m going to share three key takeaways I had from this quite unpleasant experience.</p><p>But first, shoutout to <a href="https://saligrama.io/">Adi</a> and the whole Applied Cybersecurity crew. Adi was one of my collaborators on this disclosure, and we wouldn’t have been able to stand up for ourselves like we did if it wasn’t for the Stanford Applied Cyber community.</p><p>Last October, a Stanford student startup called Fizz started getting popular on campus. It was an anonymous social media app that claimed to be something like “100% secure”. What could go wrong?</p><p>Well, a me and few security-minded friends were drawn like moths to a flame when we heard that. Our classmates were posting quite sensitive stories on Fizz, and we wanted to make sure their information was secure.</p><p>So one Friday night, we decided to explore whether Fizz was really “100% secure” like they claimed. Well, dear reader, Fizz was not 100% secure. In fact, they hardly had any security protections at all.</p><p>In only a few hours, we were able to gain full read and write access to their database, where they were storing all their user and post information — entirely deanonymized.</p><h2 id="disclosing-the-vulnerability-to-fizz">Disclosing the vulnerability to Fizz</h2><p>So we did what any good security researcher does: We responsibly disclosed what we found. We wrote a detailed vulnerability disclosure report. We suggested remediations. And we proactively agreed not to talk about our findings publicly before an embargo date to give them time to fix the issues. And then we sent them the report via email.</p><p>At first, they were grateful. They thanked us for our report and said that fixing the issues was their top priority. Then a few weeks passed. They sent us some updates.</p><p>And then, one day, they sent us a threat. A <em>crazy</em> threat. I remember it vividly. I was just finishing a run when the email came in. And my heart rate went <em>up</em> after I stopped running. That’s not what’s supposed to happen.</p><p>They said that we had violated state and federal law. They threatened us with civil and criminal charges. 20 years in prison. They really just threw everything they could at us.</p><p>And at the end of their threat they had a demand: don’t ever talk about your findings publicly. Essentially, if you agree to silence, we won’t pursue legal action. We had five days to respond.</p><p>They wanted to scare us into silence.</p><h2 id="were-going-to-need-a-lawyer">We’re going to need a lawyer</h2><p>What do you do when you get a letter like this? Well, I kind of freaked out. I was angry and scared.</p><p>Here’s the first thing my friend Cooper said in our disclosure group chat when we got the threat: “Stay calm. Don’t do anything fucking stupid. We’re going to need a lawyer.” If you can’t tell from his wisdom: It was not Cooper’s first time dealing with legal threats.</p><p>We started asking for help in our network, and within a few days, we were connected with Kurt and Andrew at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Kurt and Andrew generously agreed to represent us in our response to the letter pro bono.</p><p>We walked them through our disclosure and all our documentation. And with their advice, we made the decision not to cave to Fizz’s threats. That’s why I’m here on stage right now talking to you.</p><p>Kurt and Andrew drafted a response to Fizz. They really shut it down. As an aside, The Stanford Daily <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2022/11/01/opinion-fizz-previously-compromised-its-users-privacy-it-may-do-so-again/">published</a> Fizz’s threat and EFF’s response. I really recommend that you read these docs if you haven’t already. They’re crazy.</p><p>The Fizz team then asked to meet, and we were able to resolve the situation amicably. We pushed Fizz to proactively disclose the issues to their own users, which they eventually did.</p><h2 id="relecting-on-a-stressful-time">Relecting on a stressful time</h2><p>Now let’s take a quick step back. Getting a legal threat for our good-faith security research was incredibly stressful. And the fact that it came from our classmates added insult to injury.</p><p>I have three key takeaways from this experience I want to share.</p><ol><li><p><em>Keep your research above-board and well-documented.</em> Ahead of time, think about what you’re trying to accomplish with your research and make sure that you’re not crossing any ethical lines. A big reason why we were able to resolve this amicably — and why EFF was able to respond to Fizz’s threat so thoroughly — was that we played by the rules.</p><p>We didn’t save or leak the data we had access to. We didn’t mess with anyone’s account. We didn’t cause any damage. And we kept detailed documented of everything we did. That clean documentation was incredibly helpful for us as we wrote up our vulnerability disclosure report. I imagine it also made Kurt and Andrew’s job representing us a lot easier.</p></li><li><p><em>Stay calm.</em> I can’t tell you how much I wanted to curse out the Fizz team over email. But no. We had to keep it professional — even as they resorted to legal scare tactics.</p><p>Your goal when you get a legal threat is to stay out of trouble. To resolve the situation. That’s it. The temporary satisfaction of saying “fuck you” isn’t worth giving up the possibility of an amicable resolution.</p></li><li><p><em>Get a lawyer.</em> We could have tried to navigate the process on our own. But that would have been a profound mistake. They would have likely escalated. After all, they were banking on us being naive and caving to their scare tactics. Thankfully, Kurt and Andrew swooped in and saved the day.</p><p>Now, not everyone has the ability to get EFF to represent them pro bono. But there are an increasing number of resources available to good-faith security researchers who face legal threats, and you should make use of them. Don’t try to fly solo.</p></li></ol><p>Thank you.</p><p><img src="https://miles.land/posts/classmates-legal-threat-fizz-defcon-media/talk.jpeg" alt="A photo of us after the talk.

  <p>People join social media to enhance their social lives, make new friends and build an online identity while expressing themselves. However, as they delve deeper into these digital realms, their behavior changes.</p>
<p>Engaging in likes, shares, posts and retweets becomes habitual, eclipsing the original motivations that initially drew them to the platform. What was once a conscious choice transforms into automatic, almost impulsive action.</p>
<p>Those are the findings of a new study by researchers at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>Despite public health experts <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/23/surgeon-general-issues-new-advisory-about-effects-social-media-use-has-youth-mental-health.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising concerns</a> about the negative impact on mental health and overall well-being, particularly among young users, a significant majority of Americans — 70%, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/04/07/social-media-use-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Pew Research</a> — still find themselves drawn to their apps daily, some even hourly.</p>
<p><a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/psyc/">Psychology</a> researchers <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/profile/wendy-wood/">Wendy Wood</a> and <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/psyc/profile/ian-anderson/">Ian Anderson</a> at USC Dornsife compared posting rates of frequent, habitual users with those of infrequent, nonhabitual users. They wanted to know if those groups’ rates varied in response to the reactions and comments they received from others. The <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2023-66902-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research</a> was published online earlier this year in <em>Motivation Science</em>.</p>
<p>Building on <a href="https://news.usc.edu/204782/usc-study-reveals-the-key-reason-why-fake-news-spreads-on-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous work</a>, the researchers conducted three consecutive studies focused on Instagram and Facebook posting behavior. They found evidence that users develop posting habits that differ based on how frequently they use the two apps.</p>
<p>The studies highlighted how a daily habit of posting can become insidious over time — shifting from posting with a goal in mind to posting automatically with little thought. And this behavior can lead to a never-ending urge to share content on these platforms.</p>
<p>Using metrics from Facebook and comparing habitual users with infrequent or new users, the researchers investigated whether social rewards motivate the two types of users in the same way.</p>
<p>Anderson said he and Wood also looked at whether automatic, habitual, repeated posting on Facebook or Instagram happens when social motivation is limited or absent. “In other words, do these frequent users just post no matter if they are receiving likes or comments from their posting? Or are they posting just out of sheer habit?” he asked.</p>
<h2>Social rewards only work for some</h2>
<p>The researchers found that likes, comments and shares had less impact on frequent habitual users’ motivation to post than on infrequent users and new users.</p>
<p>In a preliminary study using Instagram user data gathered from a study conducted by Emilio Ferrara of the <a href="https://viterbischool.usc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USC Viterbi School of Engineering</a>, Woods and Anderson found, as expected, that social rewards in the form of likes indeed did motivate users to engage more frequently and faster. The more likes a user received, the more frequently they posted. Fewer likes resulted in a slower posting rate.</p>
<p>However, digging a little deeper, the researchers made an intriguing discovery: Social rewards such as likes increased engagement primarily among new or infrequent users. In contrast, frequent users continued posting at their usual rate regardless of the reactions they received from others.</p>
<p>Woods and Anderson conducted a second study to test this theory further, examining more than 1,900 Facebook posts.</p>
<p>They found that positive reactions motivated increased and faster engagement only among infrequent and new users but not among frequent users. Replicating the results from Instagram<em>,</em> habitual Facebook users continued to post quickly regardless of whether they received positive or negative recognition.</p>
<h2>Habitual users don’t care what you think</h2>
<p>The findings confirmed what Woods and Anderson suspected: With enough repetition, users form habits or mental associations tied to specific contextual cues. Context cues include factors such as the location or time when they use the app or receive notifications. For example, a user who frequently uses the app while lying in bed, sitting on the couch or at a particular time of day will start associating using the app with those specific situations. Once these habits are formed, users respond quickly and automatically whenever they encounter these context cues, with minimal deliberation.</p>
<p>In this second study, the researchers also surveyed the participants and found that for those with really strong habits, even though they said they cared about the social rewards and reactions from other people, their behavior told a different story. These users post at roughly the same rate, no matter how many likes they get. This can have adverse consequences, Anderson said.</p>
<p>“They’re not just ignoring the likes, they’re also ignoring the consequences of posting, which is how misinformation starts to spread,” he said.</p>
<p>The study indicates that motivational interventions won’t impact habitual and nonhabitual users in the same way. Simply telling people not to share certain types of content that could be harmful, dangerous or false will not be effective for habitual users, even if it works for nonhabitual users.</p>
<h2>Structural site changes may work</h2>
<p>To further test the hypothesis that frequent habitual users are not motivated by positive feedback or warnings about not posting harmful or misinformation, the researchers examined whether a structural change in a social media platform would alter the posting rates of such users.</p>
<p>In 2007, Facebook changed its platform design to increase engagement, launching a status update bar and placing content from a user’s friends at the forefront of their news feed.</p>
<p>The change initially slowed down highly frequent posters’ automatic responses. But, for infrequent users, the structural change did what it intended to do: increase engagement with others and speed up their posting rate after receiving positive reactions.</p>
<p>The study demonstrated that the design of social platforms could have an impact for the better on the posting rates of habitual posters by slowing them down for a moment.</p>
<p>However, over time, these users regained their posting speed, suggesting that they re-trained their habitual posting behavior to fit the platform’s new design.</p>
<p>Anderson concluded that if social media companies are serious about addressing issues such as misinformation, hate speech and adolescent mental health, they must also change their platforms’ structure to impact habitual users.</p>
<p>“Interventions that work for one type of user just don’t work for the other. There will have to be something really disruptive structurally on these social media sites to change the behavior of habitual users,” he said.</p>
<p>He said that if Facebook and Instagram wanted to move behavior in another direction, they would have had to change the structures to make users post accurate content. That has not happened to the degree necessary to break frequent users’ bad habits.</p>

		<p>It was only 11 months ago that I wrote an Article entitled <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/nvidia-in-the-valley/">Nvidia In the Valley</a>; the occasion was yet another plummet in their stock price:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/nvidia-4.png?resize=640%2C331&amp;ssl=1" alt="Nvidia's current stock price drop" width="640" height="331" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/nvidia-4.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/nvidia-4.png?resize=300%2C155&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/nvidia-4.png?resize=1024%2C529&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/nvidia-4.png?resize=768%2C397&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/nvidia-4.png?resize=1200%2C620&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1">
</p></blockquote>
<p>To say that the company has turned things around is, needless to say, an understatement:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-6.png?resize=640%2C310&amp;ssl=1" alt="Nvidia's latest stock rise" width="640" height="310" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-6.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-6.png?resize=300%2C145&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-6.png?resize=1024%2C496&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-6.png?resize=768%2C372&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-6.png?resize=1200%2C581&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>That big jump in May was Nvidia’s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-earnings-jenson-huangs-defense-training-versus-inference/">last earnings</a>, when the company shocked investors with an incredibly ambitious forecast; this last week Nvidia vastly exceeded those expectations and forecasted even bigger growth going forward. From the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/nvidia-nvda-q2-earnings-report-2024-814cf32d">Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Chip maker Nvidia said revenue in its recently completed quarter more than doubled from a year ago, setting a new company record, and projected that surging interest in artificial intelligence is propelling its business faster than expected. Nvidia is at the heart of the boom in artificial intelligence that made it a $1 trillion company this year, and it is forecasting growth that outpaces even the most bullish analyst projections.</p>
<p>  Nvidia’s stock, already the top performer in the S&amp;P 500 this year, rose 7.5% following the results, which would be about $87 billion in market value. The company said revenue more than doubled in its fiscal second quarter to about $13.5 billion, far ahead of Wall Street forecasts in a FactSet survey. Even more strikingly, it said revenue in its current quarter would be around $16 billion, besting expectations by about $3.5 billion. Net profit for the company’s second quarter was $6.19 billion, also surpassing forecasts.</p>
<p>  The results show a wave of investment in artificial intelligence that began late last year with the arrival of OpenAI’s ChatGPT language-generation tool is gaining steam as companies and governments seek to harness its power in business and everyday life. Many companies see AI as indispensable to their future growth and are making large investments in computing infrastructure to support it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now the big question on everyone’s mind is if Nvidia is the new Cisco:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/stockgeekTV/status/1694459398934905113"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-1.png?resize=640%2C774&amp;ssl=1" alt="Is Nvidia Cisco?" width="640" height="774" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-1.png?w=1184&amp;ssl=1 1184w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-1.png?resize=248%2C300&amp;ssl=1 248w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-1.png?resize=847%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 847w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-1.png?resize=768%2C929&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-1.png?resize=521%2C630&amp;ssl=1 521w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>I don’t think so, at least in terms of the near-term: there are some fundamental differences between Nvidia and Cisco that are worth teasing out. The bigger question is the long term, and here the comparison might be more apt.</p>
<h3>Nvidia and Cisco</h3>
<p>The first difference between Nvidia and Cisco is in the above charts: Nvidia already went through a crash, thanks to the double whammy of Ethereum moving to proof-of-stake and the COVID cliff in terms of PC sales; both left Nvidia with huge amounts of inventory it had to write-off over the second half of last year. The bright spot for Nvidia was the steady growth of data center revenue, thanks to the increase of machine learning workloads; I included this chart in that Article last fall:</p>
<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>What has happened over the last two quarters is that data center revenue is devouring the rest of the company; here is an updated version of that same chart:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-2.png?resize=640%2C370&amp;ssl=1" alt="Nvidia's sky-rocketing AI revenue" width="640" height="370" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-2.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-2.png?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-2.png?resize=1024%2C592&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-2.png?resize=768%2C444&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-2.png?resize=1090%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1090w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Here is Nvidia’s revenue mix:</p>

<p>This dramatic shift in Nvidia’s business provides some interesting contrasts to Cisco’s dot-com run-up. First, here was Cisco’s revenue, gross profit, net profit, and stock price in the ten years starting from its 1993 IPO:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-5.png?resize=640%2C398&amp;ssl=1" alt="Cisco's revenue, profit, and stock price in the 90s" width="640" height="398" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-5.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-5.png?resize=300%2C186&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-5.png?resize=1024%2C636&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-5.png?resize=768%2C477&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-5.png?resize=1014%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1014w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Here is Nvidia’s last ten years:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-4.png?resize=640%2C397&amp;ssl=1" alt="Nvidia's revenue, profit, and stock price" width="640" height="397" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-4.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-4.png?resize=300%2C186&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-4.png?resize=1024%2C634&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-4.png?resize=768%2C476&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nvidia-4.png?resize=1017%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1017w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>The first thing to note is the extent to which Nvidia’s crash last year looks similar to Cisco’s dot-com crash: in both cases steady but steep revenue increases initially outpaced the stock price, which eventually overshot just a few quarters before big inventory write-downs led to big decreases in profitability (score one for crypto optimists hopeful that the current doldrums are simply their own dot-com hangover).</p>
<p>Cisco, though, didn’t have a second act, unlike this data center explosion. What is notable is the extent to which Nvidia’s revenue increase is matching the slope of the stock price increase (obviously this is inexact given the different axis); it seems likely that the stock will overshoot revenue growth soon enough, but it hasn’t really happened yet. It’s also worth noting how much more disciplined Nvidia appears to be in terms of below-the-line costs: its net profit is moving in concert with its revenue, unlike Cisco in the 90s; I suspect this is a function of Nvidia being a much larger and more mature company.</p>
<p>Another difference is the nature of Nvidia’s customers: over 50% of the company’s Q2 revenue came from the large cloud service providers, followed by large consumer Internet companies (i.e. Meta). This category does, of course, include the startups that once might have purchased Cisco routers and Sun servers directly, and now rent capacity (if they can get it); cloud providers, though, monetize their hardware immediately, which is good for Nvidia.</p>
<p>Still, there is an important difference from other cloud workloads: previously a new company or line of business only ramped their cloud utilization with usage, which ought to correlate to customer acquisition, if not revenue. Model training, though, is an up-front cost, not dissimilar to the cost needed to buy those Sun servers and Cisco routers in the dot-com era; that is cloud revenue that has a much higher likelihood of disappearing if the company in question doesn’t find a market.</p>
<p>This point is relevant to Nvidia given that training is the part of AI where the company is the most dominant, thanks to both its software ecosystem and the ability to operate huge fleet of Nvidia chips as a single GPU; inference is where Nvidia will first see challenges, and that is also the area of AI that is correlated with usage, and thus more durable from a cloud provider perspective.</p>
<p>Those points about a software ecosystem and hardware scalability are also the biggest reason why Nvidia is different than Cisco. Nvidia has a moat in both, along with a substantial manufacturing advantage thanks to its upfront payments to TSMC over the last several years to secure its own 4nm line (and having the good fortune of asking for more scale at a time when TSMC’s other sources of high performance computing revenue are in a slump). There is certainly a massive incentive for both the cloud providers and large Internet companies to bridge Nvidia’s moats — see AWS’s investments in its own chips, for example, or Meta’s development of and support for PyTorch — but right now Nvidia has a big lead and the frenzy inspired by ChatGPT is only deepening their install base, with all of the positive ecosystem effects that entails.</p>
<h3>GPU Demand</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge facing Nvidia is the one that is ultimately out of their control: what does the final market look like?</p>
<p>Go back to the dot-com era, and the era that proceeded it. The advent of computing, first in the form of mainframes and then the PC, digitized information, making it endlessly duplicable. Then came the Internet which made the marginal cost of distributing that content go to zero (with the caveat that most people had very low bandwidth). This was an obvious business opportunity that plenty of startups jumped all over, even as telecom companies took on the bandwidth problem; Cisco was the beneficiary of both.</p>
<p>The missing element, though, was demand: consistent consumer demand for Internet applications only started to arrive with the advent of broadband connections in the 2000s (thanks in part to a buildout that bankrupted said telecom companies), and then exploded with smartphones a decade later, which made the Internet accessible anytime, anywhere. It was demand that made the router business as big as dot-com investors thought it might be, although by then Cisco had a host of competitors, including large cloud providers who built (and open-sourced) their own.</p>
<p>There are lots of potential starting points to choose for AI: machine learning has obviously been a thing for a while, or you might point to the 2017 invention of the transformer; the release of GPT-3 in 2020 was perhaps akin to the release of the Mosaic web browser, which would make ChatGPT the Netscape IPO. One way to categorize this emergence is to characterize training as being akin to digitization in the previous era, and creation —&nbsp;i.e. inference — as akin to distribution. Once again there are obvious business opportunities that arise from combining the two, and once again startups are jumping all over them, along with the big incumbents.</p>
<p>However you want to make the analogy, what is important to note is that the missing element is the same: demand. ChatGPT took the world by storm, and the use of AI for writing code is both proliferating widely and is extremely high leverage. Every SaaS company in tech, meanwhile, is hard at work at an AI strategy, for the benefit of their sales team if nothing else. That is no small thing, and the exploration and implementation of those strategies will use up a lot of Nvidia GPUs over the next few years. The ultimate question, though, is how much of this AI stuff is actually used, and that is ultimately out of Nvidia’s control.</p>
<p>My best guess is that the next several years will be occupied building out the most obvious use cases, particularly in the enterprise; the analogy here is to the 2000s build-out of the web. The question, though, is what will be the analogy to mobile (and the cloud), which exploded demand and led to one of the most profitable decades tech has ever seen? The answer may be an already discarded fad: the metaverse.</p>
<h3>A GPU Overhang and the Metaverse</h3>
<p>In April 2022, when Dall-E 2 came out, I wrote <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/dall-e-the-metaverse-and-zero-marginal-content/">DALL-E, the Metaverse, and Zero Marginal Content</a>, and highlighted three trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the gaming industry was increasingly about a few AAA games, small indie titles, and the huge sea of mobile; the limiting factor in further development was the astronomical cost of developing high quality assets.</li>
<li>Second, social media succeeded by virtue of making content creation free, because users created the content of their own volition.</li>
<li>Third, TikTok pointed to a future where every individual not only had their own feed, but also where the provenance of that content didn’t matter.</li>
</ul>
<p>AI is how those three trends might intersect:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What is fascinating about DALL-E is that it points to a future where these three trends can be combined. DALL-E, at the end of the day, is ultimately a product of human-generated content, just like its GPT-3 cousin. The latter, of course, is about text, while DALL-E is about images. Notice, though, that progression from text to images; it follows that machine learning-generated video is next. This will likely take several years, of course; video is a much more difficult problem, and responsive 3D environments more difficult yet, but this is a path the industry has trod before:</p>
<ul>
<li>Game developers pushed the limits on text, then images, then video, then 3D</li>
<li>Social media drives content creation costs to zero first on text, then images, then video</li>
<li>Machine learning models can now create text and images for zero marginal cost</li>
</ul>
<p>  In the very long run this points to a metaverse vision that is much less deterministic than your typical video game, yet much richer than what is generated on social media. Imagine environments that are not drawn by artists but rather created by AI: this not only increases the possibilities, but crucially, decreases the costs.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I wrote in the conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Machine learning generated content is just the next step beyond TikTok: instead of pulling content from anywhere on the network, GPT and DALL-E and other similar models generate new content from content, at zero marginal cost. This is how the economics of the metaverse will ultimately make sense: virtual worlds need virtual content created at virtually zero cost, fully customizable to the individual.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Zero marginal cost is, I should note, aspirational at this point: inference is expensive, both in terms of power and also in terms of the need to pay off all of that money that is showing up on Nvidia’s earnings. It’s possible to imagine a scenario a few years down the line, though, where Nvidia has deployed countless ever more powerful GPUs, and inspired massive competition such that the world’s supply of GPU power far exceeds demand, driving the marginal costs down to the cost of energy (which hopefully will have become cheaper as well); suddenly the idea of making virtual environments on demand won’t seem so far-fetched, opening up entirely new end-user experiences that explode demand in the way that mobile once did.</p>
<h3>The GPU Age</h3>
<p>The challenge for Nvidia is that this future isn’t particularly investable; indeed, the idea assumes a capacity overhang at some point, which is not great for the stock price! That, though, is how technology advances, and even if a cliff eventually comes, there is a lot of money to be made in the meantime.</p>
<p>That noted, the biggest short-term question I have is around Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s insistence that the current wave of demand is in fact the dawn of what he calls accelerated computing; from the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4630703-nvidia-corp-nvda-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript">Nvidia earnings call</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I’m reluctant to guess about the future and so I’ll answer the question from the first principle of computer science perspective. It is recognized for some time now that…using general purpose computing at scale is no longer the best way to go forward. It’s too energy costly, it’s too expensive, and the performance of the applications are too slow. And finally, the world has a new way of doing it. It’s called accelerated computing and what kicked it into turbocharge is generative AI. But accelerated computing could be used for all kinds of different applications that’s already in the data center. And by using it, you offload the CPUs. You save a ton of money in order of magnitude, in cost and order of magnitude and energy and the throughput is higher and that’s what the industry is really responding to.</p>
<p>  Going forward, the best way to invest in the data center is to divert the capital investment from general purpose computing and focus it on generative AI and accelerated computing. Generative AI provides a new way of generating productivity, a new way of generating new services to offer to your customers, and accelerated computing helps you save money and save power. And the number of applications is, well, tons. Lots of developers, lots of applications, lots of libraries. It’s ready to be deployed.</p>
<p>  And so I think the data centers around the world recognize this, that this is the best way to deploy resources, deploy capital going forward for data centers. This is true for the world’s clouds and you’re seeing a whole crop of new GPU-specialized cloud service providers. One of the famous ones is CoreWeave and they’re doing incredibly well. But you’re seeing the regional GPU specialist service providers all over the world now. And it’s because they all recognize the same thing, that the best way to invest their capital going forward is to put it into accelerated computing and generative AI.
</p></blockquote>
<p>My interpretation of Huang’s outlook is that all of these GPUs will be used for a lot of the same activities that are currently run on CPUs; that is certainly a bullish view for Nvidia, because it means the capacity overhang that may come from pursuing generative AI will be back-filled by current cloud computing workloads. And, to be fair, Huang has a point about the power and space limitations of current architectures.</p>
<p>That noted, I’m skeptical: humans — and companies — are lazy, and not only are CPU-based applications easier to develop, they are also mostly already built. I have a hard time seeing what companies are going to go through the time and effort to port things that already run on CPUs to GPUs; at the end of the day, the applications that run in a cloud are determined by customers who provide the demand for cloud resources, not cloud providers looking to optimize FLOP/rack.</p>
<p>If GPUs are going to be as big of a market as Nvidia’s investors hope it will be, it will be because applications that are only possible with GPUs generate the demand to make it so. I’m confident that time will come; what I, nor Huang, nor anyone else can be sure of is when that time will arrive.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
          Washington D.C.,           Aug. 28, 2023 —
        </p><div><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Impact Theory, LLC, a media and entertainment company headquartered in Los Angeles, with conducting an unregistered offering of crypto asset securities in the form of purported non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Impact Theory raised approximately $30 million from hundreds of investors, including investors across the United States, through the offering.</p>

<p>According to the SEC’s order, from October to December 2021, Impact Theory offered and sold three tiers of NFTs, known as Founder’s Keys, which Impact Theory called “Legendary,” “Heroic,” and “Relentless.” The order finds that Impact Theory encouraged potential investors to view the purchase of a Founder’s Key as an investment into the business, stating that investors would profit from their purchases if Impact Theory was successful in its efforts. Among other things, Impact Theory emphasized that it was “trying to build the next Disney,” and, if successful, it would deliver “tremendous value” to Founder’s Key purchasers. The order finds that the NFTs offered and sold to investors were investment contracts and therefore securities. Accordingly, Impact Theory violated the federal securities laws by offering and selling these crypto asset securities to the public in an unregistered offering that was not otherwise exempt from registration.</p>

<p>“Absent a valid exemption, offerings of securities, in whatever form, must be registered,” said Antonia Apps, Director of the SEC’s New York Regional Office. “Without registration, investors of all types are deprived of the protections afforded them by the robust disclosures and other safeguards long provided by our securities laws.”</p>

<p>Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Impact Theory agreed to a cease-and-desist order finding that it violated registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and ordering it to pay a combined total of more than $6.1 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The order also establishes a Fair Fund to return monies that injured investors paid to purchase the NFTs. Impact Theory agreed to destroy all Founder’s Keys in its possession or control, publish notice of the order on its websites and social media channels, and eliminate any royalty that Impact Theory might otherwise receive from future secondary market transactions involving the Founder’s Keys.</p>

<p>The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Benjamin Mishkin, Jessica Quinn, and Judith Weinstock of the SEC’s New York Regional Office. Hane L. Kim of the Division of Examinations, Gwen Licardo, Pamela Sawhney, and Mark R. Sylvester of the Enforcement Division’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit (CACU) and Carmen Taveras Alam, Ignacio Franceschelli, and Joshua Mallett of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis provided assistance. The investigation was supervised by Sheldon Pollock, David Hirsch, and Jorge Tenreiro.&nbsp;</p>

I am a hot-air balloon pilot and I love everything that flies with the lighter-than-air principle.<p>One limitation I could see for your business model is that airships can only be flown in a controlled direction at rather slow wind speeds. That is because they just have such a huge attack surface and the motors have limited thrust.</p><p>Did you do an estimate how many days per year you could fly your vehicle in a given economic area of interest? I fly balloons in Switzerland and I think you can get at most 100 days of good flight conditions a year. But yeah, with some climate data and your operational limitations you can probably estimate how many days you get in a given area...

I was wondering, what are the benefits and drawbacks to flying a lighter-than-air ship under 1,000 feet? Or even closer to the ground/tops of buildings? &lt;500 feet? Are there simply too many regulatory issues?<p>I have a dream that some day there will be airships floating around cities, ferrying passengers and freight, and they will float only 30-100 meters above the tallest buildings.

Presumably, the regulations were written before remotely operated or autonomous airships were envisioned, but even so we opted to baseline helium to avoid the risk of a waiver being denied. I assume other countries have similar airworthiness rules.<p>[1] <a href="https://tc.canada.ca/en/corporate-services/acts-regulations/list-regulations/canadian-aviation-regulations-sor-96-433/standards/airworthiness-chapter-541-airships-canadian-aviation-regulations-cars" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://tc.canada.ca/en/corporate-services/acts-regulations/...</a>

We asked the same question to the EU aviation authority and they told us that were  not seeing any problem with using H2 as a lifting gas because of the great record of the Gordon Bennett Cup: <a href="https://balloonfiesta.com/Gordon-Bennett-2023" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://balloonfiesta.com/Gordon-Bennett-2023</a>.

There's been multiple cases in the US of people intentionally shooting down drones operating above their property, including in urban areas, and it has not yet been heard by the Supreme Court.  Common Law held that property owners controlled their property from the Earth to the Heavens, which is inclusive of airspace.  The current law in the US says that property owners control their airspace within their "reasonable control".<p>I am not a lawyer, but is is a very open question if you're flying low enough someone can visually sight you and shoot you down over their property, whether or not that this is a violation of the law /for unmanned vehicles/.  Drones in particular have become a serious nuisance and many property owners have taken actions against them in the US triggering court cases, most of which haven't yet reached their conclusion.</p><p>EDIT to add that the rules here even vary by state in the US, in some states you own 83 feet over your property of airspace, in others it could be as much as 400 feet (above 400 feet is controlled airspace under the jurisdiction of the FAA).  Generally speaking, shooting any aircraft, jamming any radio signal, or shining laser pointers on any aircraft is already federally illegal in the US and violates FAA/FCC regulations, but it's not clear that these regulations are actually constitutional and enforceable, or that it cannot be an act of self-defense to shoot down a low-flying aircraft intruding on your property.

We had some issues with background separation - given the conductor hung at varying heights and the drone flew at a constant height, the camera was always refocusing - it was hard to get consistent results. It ended up resulting in false positives more than anything.</p><p>I'm also interested in how you discern defects. Some sort of anomaly detection? ML? If so, how did you source training data? Also would be interested in how you determine speciation for underclearance of lines.</p><p>So many cool elements of this to nerd out about. Congrats on launch, will be following closely!

It does increase leak potential but the materials and glues are in constant improvements. And, we do not need to oversize the envelope this much because the airship is extremely energy efficient and consume very little energy (during all our flight test we are always amazed when we have 80% left of battery or H2 at the end of the flights). 
But yes, for now, we keep fuel and lighter than air gas separated and we will keep this possibility for a long time.</p><p>Thank you for the feedback!

        <p>LFortran is a modern open-source (BSD licensed) interactive Fortran compiler
built on top of LLVM. It can execute user’s code interactively to allow
exploratory work (much like Python, MATLAB or Julia) as well as compile to
binaries with the goal to run user’s code on modern architectures such as
multi-core CPUs and GPUs.</p>
<p>LFortran is in development (alpha stage), and as of spring 2023 we are able to
compile and run both legacy and modern Minpack, see the following blog post for
more information:

            <h2 id="feature-highlights">Feature Highlights</h2>
<p>LFortran is in development, there are features that work today, and there are
features that are being implemented.</p>
<h2 id="works-today">Works today</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Full Fortran 2018 parser</strong><br>
LFortran can parse any Fortran 2018 syntax to AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
and format it back as Fortran source code (<code>lfortran fmt</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interactive, Jupyter support</strong><br>
LFortran can be used as a Jupyter kernel, allowing Python/Julia-style rapid
prototyping and an exploratory workflow (<code>conda install jupyter lfortran</code>).
It can also be used from the command-line with an interactive prompt
(REPL).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clean, modular design, usable as a library</strong><br>
LFortran is structured around two independent modules, AST (Abstract Syntax
Tree) and ASR (Abstract Semantic Representation), both of which are
standalone (completely independent of the rest of LFortran) and users are
encouraged to use them independently for other applications and build tools
on top. See the <a href="https://docs.lfortran.org/design/">Design</a> and
<a href="https://docs.lfortran.org/developer_tutorial/">Developer Tutorial</a> documents for
more details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create executables</strong><br>
It can create executables just like other Fortran compilers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Runs on Linux, Mac, Windows and WebAssembly</strong><br>
All four platforms are regularly tested by our CI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Several backends</strong>
The LLVM can be used to compile to binaries and for interactive usage. The
C++ backend translates Fortran code to a readable C++ code. The x86 backend
allows very fast compilation directly to x86 machine code. The WebAssembly
backend can quickly generate WASM.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="under-development">Under Development</h2>
<p>These features are under development:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Full Fortran 2018 support</strong><br>
The parser can now parse all of Fortran 2018 syntax to AST. A smaller
subset can be transformed into ASR and even smaller subset compiled via
LLVM to machine code. We are now working on extending the subset that
LFortran can fully compile until we reach full Fortran 2018 support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support for diverse hardware</strong><br>
LLVM makes it possible to run LFortran on diverse hardware and take
advantage of native Fortran language constructs (such as <code>do concurrent</code>)
on multi-core CPUs and GPUs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please vote on issues in our <a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/issues">issue tracker</a> that you want us to prioritize
(feel free to create new ones if we are missing anything).</p>

The scope of the combined project expanded beyond tracing to cover all of observability. OTEL's mission is to help organizations deliver </span><strong>high-quality, ubiquitous, and portable telemetry.</strong></p><p>Four years later, OTEL is making good on its promise. It has to date provided a stable standard for the three pillars of observability (metrics, logs, and traces), a collector that can receive, process, and export telemetry in any environment, and SDKs to instrument code in all major languages. It has also continued to expand its scope and introduced additional standards around semantic conventions and agent management.</p><p>Today, OTEL is the second most active project in the CNCF, behind only Kubernetes in popularity. Its contributors are spread across all major observability vendors and its protocol has near-universal adoption among observability providers.</p><p>In this post, we'll go over where OTEL is today, provide a summary of the various projects that fall under its domain, and talk about where it's going next.</p><p>OTEL consists mainly of two types of projects: specifications and implementations.</p><p>Specifications are the foundation of OTEL. They describe how telemetry should be captured, collected, processed, and exported. Specifications tend to be vendor-focused as they define the common standard that vendors have to implement to be compatible with OTEL.</p><p>Implementations are the specific client libraries and tooling that are used to handle telemetry data. Implementations tend to be end-user-focused as they consist of the parts that end-users use to instrument their code.</p><p>A project's stability is typically marked on a signal-by-signal basis. Each signal is a specific type of telemetry data - in OTEL, this means metrics, logs, and traces.</p><p>OTEL today consists of the following sub-projects:</p><ul><li><p>OpenTelemetry Specification (specification)</p></li><li><p>OpenTelemetry SDKs (implementation)</p></li><li><p>OpenTelemetry Protocol (specification)</p></li><li><p>OpenTelemetry Collector (implementation)</p></li><li><p>Open Agent Management Protocol (specification)</p></li><li><p>OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions (specification)</p></li></ul><p><span>The </span><a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/overview/" rel="">Open Telemetry specification</a><span> is the foundation of OTEL - it provides the APIs, SDKs, and data models that all other OTEL standards are derived from.</span></p><p>A brief timeline of its development:</p><ul><li><p><span>2020-09: Tracing marked </span><a href="https://medium.com/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-collector-achieves-tracing-stability-milestone-80e34cadbbf5" rel="">stable</a></p></li><li><p><span>2021-11: Metrics marked </span><a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/pull/2104" rel="">stable</a></p></li><li><p><span>2023-04: Logs marked </span><a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/pull/3376" rel="">stable</a></p></li></ul><p><span>In terms of maturity, the OTEL spec is now </span><strong>stable for all signals</strong><span>.

<p>Every few months we get an alert from our database monitoring to warn us that we are about to run out of space. Usually we just provision more storage and forget about it, but this time we were under quarantine, and the system in question was under less load than usual. We thought this is a good opportunity to do some cleanups that would otherwise be much more challenging.</p>
<p>To start from the end, <strong>we ended up freeing more than 70GB of un-optimized and un-utilized space</strong> without dropping a single index or deleting any data!</p>
<p>Using conventional technics such as rebuilding indexes and tables we cleared up a lot of space, but then <strong>one surprising find helped us clear an additional ~20GB of unused indexed values!</strong></p>
<p>This is what the free storage chart of one of our databases looked like in the process:</p>

<h2 id="the-usual-suspects"><a href="#the-usual-suspects">The Usual Suspects</a></h2>
<p>Provisioning storage is something we do from time to time, but before we throw money at the problem we like to make sure we make good use of the storage we already have. To do that, we start with the usual suspects.</p>
<h3 id="unused-indexes"><a href="#unused-indexes">Unused Indexes</a></h3>
<p>Unused indexes are double-edged swords; you create them to make things faster, but they end up taking space and slow inserts and updates. Unused indexes are the first thing we always check when we need to clear up storage.</p>
<p>To find unused indexes we use the following query:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span>
    <span>relname</span><span>,</span>
    <span>indexrelname</span><span>,</span>
    <span>idx_scan</span><span>,</span>
    <span>idx_tup_read</span><span>,</span>
    <span>idx_tup_fetch</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pg_size_pretty</span><span>(</span><span>pg_relation_size</span><span>(</span><span>indexrelname</span><span>::</span><span>regclass</span><span>))</span> <span>as</span> <span>size</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    <span>pg_stat_all_indexes</span>
<span>WHERE</span>
    <span>schemaname</span> <span>=</span> <span>'public'</span>
    <span>AND</span> <span>indexrelname</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>LIKE</span> <span>'pg_toast_%'</span>
<span>    <span>AND</span> <span>idx_scan</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
</span><span>    <span>AND</span> <span>idx_tup_read</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
</span><span>    <span>AND</span> <span>idx_tup_fetch</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
</span><span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span>
    <span>pg_relation_size</span><span>(</span><span>indexrelname</span><span>::</span><span>regclass</span><span>)</span> <span>DESC</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The query is looking for <strong>indexes that were not scanned or fetched</strong> since the last time the statistics were reset.</p>
<p>Some indexes may seem like they were not used but they were in-fact used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-ALL-INDEXES-VIEW" rel="noopener">The documentation</a> lists a few scenarios when this is possible. For example, when the optimizer uses meta data from the index, but not the index itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indexes used to enforce unique or primary key constraints for tables that were not updated in a while. The indexes will look like they were not used, but it doesn't mean we can dispose of them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To find the unused indexes you can actually drop, you usually have to go over the list one by one and make a decision. This can be time consuming in the first couple of times, but after you get rid of most unused indexes it becomes easier.</p>
<p>It's also a good idea to <strong>reset the statistics counters from time to time</strong>, usually right after you finished inspecting the list. PostgreSQL provides a few <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-STATS-FUNCS-TABLE" rel="noopener">functions to reset statistics</a> at different levels. When we find an index we suspect is not being used, or when we add new indexes in place of old ones, we usually reset the counters for the table and wait for a while:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- Find table oid by name</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>oid</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_class</span> <span>c</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>relname</span> <span>=</span> <span>'table_name'</span><span>;</span>
<span>-- Reset counts for all indexes of table</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_stat_reset_single_table_counters</span><span>(</span><span>14662536</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We do this every once in a while, so in our case there were no unused indexes to drop.</p>
<h3 id="index-and-table-bloat"><a href="#index-and-table-bloat">Index and Table Bloat</a></h3>
<p>The next suspect is bloat. When you update rows in a table, PostgreSQL marks the tuple as dead and adds the updated tuple in the next available space. This process creates what's called "bloat", which can cause tables to consume more space than they really need. Bloat also affects indexes, so to free up space, bloat is a good place to look.</p>
<p>Estimating bloat in tables and indexes is apparently not a simple task. Lucky for us, some good people on the world wide web already <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Show_database_bloat" rel="noopener">did the hard work</a> and wrote queries to estimate <a href="https://github.com/ioguix/pgsql-bloat-estimation/blob/master/table/table_bloat.sql" rel="noopener">table bloat</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ioguix/pgsql-bloat-estimation/blob/master/btree/btree_bloat.sql" rel="noopener">index bloat</a>. After running these queries you will most likely find <em>some</em> bloat, so the next thing to do it clear up that space.</p>
<h4 id="clearing-bloat-in-indexes"><a href="#clearing-bloat-in-indexes">Clearing Bloat in Indexes</a></h4>
<p>To clear bloat in an index, you need to rebuild it. There are several ways to rebuild an index:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Re-create the index</strong>: If you re-create the index, it will be built in an optimal way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rebuild the index</strong>: Instead of dropping and creating the index yourself, PostgreSQL provides a way to re-build an existing index in-place using the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-reindex.html" rel="noopener"><code>REINDEX</code></a> command:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><span></span><span>REINDEX</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>index_name</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<ol>
<li><strong>Rebuild the index concurrently</strong>: The previous methods will obtain a lock on the table and prevent it from being changed while the operation is in progress, which is usually unacceptable. To rebuild the index without locking it for updates, you can <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-reindex.html#SQL-REINDEX-CONCURRENTLY" rel="noopener">rebuilt the index concurrently</a>:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><span></span><span>REINDEX</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>CONCURRENTLY</span> <span>index_name</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When using <code>REINDEX CONCURRENTLY</code>, PostgreSQL creates a new index with a name suffixed with <code>_ccnew</code>, and syncs any changes made to the table in the meantime. When the rebuild is done, it will switch the old index with the new index, and drop the old one.</p>
<figure>
<figcaption>Clearing bloat in Indexes</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If for some reason you had to stop the rebuild in the middle, the new index will not be dropped. Instead, it will be left in an invalid state and consume space. To identify invalid indexes that were created during <code>REINDEX</code>, we use the following query:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- Identify invalid indexes that were created during index rebuild</span>
<span>SELECT</span>
    <span>c</span><span>.</span><span>relname</span> <span>as</span> <span>index_name</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pg_size_pretty</span><span>(</span><span>pg_relation_size</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>.</span><span>oid</span><span>))</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    <span>pg_index</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>pg_class</span> <span>c</span> <span>ON</span> <span>i</span><span>.</span><span>indexrelid</span> <span>=</span> <span>c</span><span>.</span><span>oid</span>
<span>WHERE</span>
    <span>-- New index built using REINDEX CONCURRENTLY</span>
    <span>c</span><span>.</span><span>relname</span> <span>LIKE</span>  <span>'%_ccnew'</span>
    <span>-- In INVALID state</span>
    <span>AND</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>indisvalid</span>
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Once the rebuild process is no longer active, it should be safe to drop any remaining invalid indexes.</p>
<h4 id="activating-b-tree-index-deduplication"><a href="#activating-b-tree-index-deduplication">Activating B-Tree Index Deduplication</a></h4>
<p>PostgreSQL 13 introduced a new efficient way of storing duplicate values in B-Tree indexes called <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/btree-implementation.html#BTREE-DEDUPLICATION" rel="noopener">"B-Tree Deduplication"</a>.</p>
<p>For each indexed value, a B-Tree index will hold in its leaf both the value and a pointer to the row (TID). The larger the indexed values, the larger the index. Up until PostgreSQL 12, when the index contained many duplicate values, all of these duplicate values would be stored in the index leaves. This is not very efficient and can take up a lot of space.</p>
<figure>
<figcaption>B-Tree Index Deduplication</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Starting at PostgreSQL 13, when B-Tree deduplication is activated, duplicate values are only stored once. This can make a huge impact on the size of indexes with many duplicate values.</p>
<p>In PostgreSQL 13 index deduplication in enabled by default, unless you deactivate it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- Activating de-deduplication for a B-Tree index, this is the default:</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>index_name</span> <span>ON</span> <span>table_name</span><span>(</span><span>column_name</span><span>)</span> <span>WITH</span> <span>(</span><span>deduplicate_items</span> <span>=</span> <span>ON</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you are migrating from PostgreSQL versions prior to 13, you need to rebuild the indexes using the <code>REINDEX</code> command in order to get the full benefits of index de-deduplication.</p>
<p>To illustrate the effect of B-Tree deduplication on the size of the index, create a table with a unique column and a non unique column, and populate it with 1M rows. On each column create two B-Tree indexes, one with deduplication enabled and another with deduplication disabled:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db</span><span>=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>test_btree_dedup</span> <span>(</span><span>n_unique</span> <span>serial</span><span>,</span> <span>n_not_unique</span> <span>integer</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span>

<span>db</span><span>=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>test_btree_dedup</span> <span>(</span><span>n_not_unique</span><span>)</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>(</span><span>random</span><span>()</span> <span>*</span> <span>100</span><span>)::</span><span>int</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>generate_series</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1000000</span><span>);</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>0</span> <span>1000000</span>

<span>db</span><span>=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>ix1</span> <span>ON</span> <span>test_btree_dedup</span> <span>(</span><span>n_unique</span><span>)</span>     <span>WITH</span> <span>(</span><span>deduplicate_items</span> <span>=</span> <span>OFF</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span>

<span>db</span><span>=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>ix3</span> <span>ON</span> <span>test_btree_dedup</span> <span>(</span><span>n_not_unique</span><span>)</span> <span>WITH</span> <span>(</span><span>deduplicate_items</span> <span>=</span> <span>OFF</span><span>);</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Next, compare the sizes of the four indexes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Column</th>
<th>Deduplication</th>
<th>Size</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Not unique</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>6840 kB</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>As expected, deduplication had no effect on the unique index, but it had a significant effect on the index that had many duplicate values.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for us, PostgreSQL 13 was still fresh at the time, and our cloud provider did not have support for it yet, so we were unable to use deduplication to clear space.</p>
<h4 id="clearing-bloat-in-tables"><a href="#clearing-bloat-in-tables">Clearing Bloat in Tables</a></h4>
<p>Just like in indexes, tables can also contain dead tuples that cause bloat and fragmentation. However, unlike indexes that contain data from an associated table, a table can not just simply be re-created. To re-create a table you would have to create a new table, migrate the data over while keeping it synced with new data, create all the indexes, constraints and any referential constraints in other tables. Only after all of this is done, you can switch the old table with the new one.</p>
<figure>
<figcaption>Clearing bloat in Tables</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are several ways to rebuild a table and reduce bloat:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Re-create the table</strong>: Using this method as described above often requires a lot of development, especially if the table is actively being used as it's being rebuilt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vacuum the table</strong>: PostgreSQL provides a way to reclaim space occupied by bloat and dead tuples in a table using the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html" rel="noopener"><code>VACUUM FULL</code> command</a>. Vacuum full requires a lock on the table, and is not an ideal solution for tables that need to be available while being vacuumed:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- Will lock the table</span>
<span>VACUUM</span> <span>FULL</span> <span>table_name</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The two options above require either a significant effort, or some down time.</p>
<h4 id="using-pg_repack"><a href="#using-pg_repack">Using pg_repack</a></h4>
<p>Both built-in options for rebuilding tables are not ideal unless you can afford downtime. One popular solution for rebuilding tables and indexes without downtime is the <a href="https://reorg.github.io/pg_repack/" rel="noopener">pg_repack extension</a>.</p>
<p>Being a popular extension, <code>pg_repack</code> is likely available from your package manager or already installed by your cloud provider. To use <code>pg_repack</code>, you first need to create the extension:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>pg_repack</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To "repack" a table along with its indexes, issue the following command from the console:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$</span> pg_repack -k --table table_name db_name
</pre></div>


<p>To rebuild a table with no downtime, the extension creates a new table, loads the data from the original table into it while keeping it up to date with new data, and then also rebuilds the indexes. When the process is finished, the two tables are switched and the original table is dropped. See <a href="https://reorg.github.io/pg_repack/#details" rel="noopener">here</a> for full details.</p>

<p>There are two caveats to be aware of when using <code>pg_repack</code> to rebuild tables:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Requires amount of storage roughly the amount of the table to rebuild</strong>: the extension creates another table to copy the data to, so it requires additional storage roughly the size of the table and its indexes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>May require some manual cleanup</strong>: if the "repack" process failed or stopped manually, it may leave intermediate objects laying around, so you may need to do some manual cleanup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these caveats, <code>pg_repack</code> is a great option for rebuilding tables and indexes with no downtime. However, because it requires some additional storage to operate, it's not a good option when you are <em>already</em> out of storage. It's a good idea to monitor the free storage space and plan rebuilds in advance.</p>

<p>At this point we already used all the conventional techniques we could think of and cleared up <em>a lot</em> of space. We dropped unused indexes and cleared bloat from tables and indexes, but... there was still more space to shave off!</p>
<h3 id="the-aha-moment"><a href="#the-aha-moment">The "Aha Moment"</a></h3>
<p>While we were looking at the sizes of the indexes after we finished rebuilding them, an interesting thing caught our eye.</p>
<p>One of our largest tables stores transaction data. In our system, after a payment is made, the user can choose to cancel and get a refund. This is not happening very often, and only a fraction of the transactions end up being cancelled.</p>
<p>In our transactions table, there are foreign keys to both the purchasing user and the cancelling user, and each field has a B-Tree index defined on it. The purchasing user has a NOT NULL constraint on it so all the rows hold a value. The cancelling user on the other hand, is nullable, and only a fraction of the rows hold any data. Most of the values in the cancelling user field are NULL.</p>

</p><figcaption>Transactions table with FK to purchasing and cancelling user</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We expected the index on the cancelling user to be significantly smaller than the index on the purchasing user, but they were exactly the same. Coming from Oracle, I was always taught that <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/sqlrf/CREATE-INDEX.html#GUID-1F89BBC0-825F-4215-AF71-7588E31D8BFE" rel="noopener">NULLs are not indexed</a>, but in PostgreSQL they are! This "Aha" moment led us to the realization that <strong>we were indexing a lot of unnecessary values for no reason</strong>.</p>
<p>This was the original index we had for the cancelling user:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>transaction_cancelled_by_ix</span> <span>ON</span> <span>transactions</span><span>(</span><span>cancelled_by_user_id</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To check our thesis, we replaced the index with a partial index that excludes null values:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>DROP</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>transaction_cancelled_by_ix</span><span>;</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>transaction_cancelled_by_part_ix</span> <span>ON</span> <span>transactions</span><span>(</span><span>cancelled_by_user_id</span><span>)</span>
<span><span>WHERE</span> <span>cancelled_by_user_id</span> <span>IS</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
</span></pre></div>


<p>The full index after we reindexed it was 769MB in size, with more than 99% null values. The partial index that excluded null values was less than 5MB. That's more than 99% percent of dead weight shaved off the index!</p>

<p>To make sure those NULL values were indeed unnecessary, we reset the stats on the table and waited a while. Not long after, we observed that the index is being used just like the old one! <strong>We just shaved off more than 760MB of unused indexed tuples without compromising performance!</strong></p>

<p>In the table above we can identify several types of results:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tx_cancelled_by_ix</code> is a large index with many null values: great potential here!</li>
<li><code>tx_op_1_ix</code> is a large index with few null values: there's not much potential</li>
<li><code>tx_token_ix</code> is a small index with few null values: I wouldn't bother with this index</li>
<li><code>tx_op_name_ix</code> is a large index with no null values: nothing to do here</li>
</ul>
<p>The results show that by turning <code>tx_cancelled_by_ix</code> into a partial index that excludes null we can potentially save ~1.3GB.</p>
<p><strong>Is it always beneficial to exclude nulls from indexes?</strong></p>
<p>No. <code>NULL</code> is as meaningful as any other value. If your queries are searching for null values using <code>IS NULL</code>, these queries might benefit from an index on <code>NULL</code>.</p>
<p><strong>So is this method beneficial only for null values?</strong></p>
<p>Using partial indexes to exclude values that are not queried very often or not at all can be beneficial for any value, not just null values. <code>NULL</code> usually indicate a lack of value, and in our case not many queries were searching for null values, so it made sense to exclude them from the index.</p>
<p><strong>So how did you end up clearing more than 20GB?</strong></p>
<p>You may have noticed that the title mentions more than 20GB of free space but the charts only show half, well... indexes are also dropped from replications! When you release 10GB from your primary database, you also release roughly the same amount of storage from each replica.</p>

<p>This story is taken from a large application built with Django. To put the above techniques to practice with Django, there are several things to note.</p>
<h3 id="prevent-implicit-creation-of-indexes-on-foreign-keys"><a href="#prevent-implicit-creation-of-indexes-on-foreign-keys">Prevent Implicit Creation of Indexes on Foreign Keys</a></h3>
<p>Unless you explicitly set <code>db_index=False</code>, <a href="https://hakibenita.com/9-django-tips-for-working-with-databases#fk-indexes">Django will implicitly create a B-Tree index on a <code>models.ForeignKey</code> field</a>. Consider the following example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.db</span> <span>import</span> <span>models</span>
<span>from</span> <span>django.contrib.auth.models</span> <span>import</span> <span>User</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Transaction</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span># ...</span>
<span>    <span>cancelled_by_user</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>ForeignKey</span><span>(</span>
</span>        <span>to</span><span>=</span><span>User</span><span>,</span>
        <span>null</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span>
        <span>on_delete</span><span>=</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>CASCADE</span><span>,</span>
    <span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The model is used to keep track of transaction data. If a transaction is cancelled, we keep a reference to user that cancelled it. As previously described, most transactions don't end up being cancelled, so we set <code>null=True</code> on the field.</p>
<p>In the <code>ForeignKey</code> definition above we did not explicitly set <code>db_index</code>, so Django will implicitly create a full index on the field. To create a partial index instead, make the following changes:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.db</span> <span>import</span> <span>models</span>
<span>from</span> <span>django.contrib.auth.models</span> <span>import</span> <span>User</span>

<p>We first tell Django not to create the index on the FK field, and then add a partial index using <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/indexes/" rel="noopener"><code>models.Index</code></a>.</p>
<div>
<p>take away</p>
<p>Nullable foreign keys are good candidates for a partial index!</p>
</div>
<p>To prevent implicit features such as this one from sneaking indexes without us noticing, <a href="https://hakibenita.com/automating-the-boring-stuff-in-django-using-the-check-framework">we create Django checks</a> to force ourselves to <a href="https://hakibenita.com/automating-the-boring-stuff-in-django-using-the-check-framework#h008-must-set-db_index-explicitly-on-a-foreignkey-field">always explicitly set <code>db_index</code> in foreign keys</a>.</p>
<h3 id="migrate-exiting-full-indexes-to-partial-indexes"><a href="#migrate-exiting-full-indexes-to-partial-indexes">Migrate Exiting Full Indexes to Partial Indexes</a></h3>
<p>One of the challenges we were facing during this migration is to replace the existing full indexes with partial indexes without causing downtime or degraded performance during the migration. After we identified the full indexes we want to replace, we took the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Replace full indexes with partial indexes</strong>: Adjust the relevant Django models and replace full indexes with partial indexes, as demonstrated above. The migration Django generates will first disable the FK constraint (if the field is a foreign key), drop the existing full index and create the new partial index. Executing this migration may cause both downtime and degraded performance, so we won't actually run it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create the partial indexes manually</strong>: Use Django's <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-sqlmigrate" rel="noopener"><code>./manage.py sqlmigrate</code></a> utility to produce a script for the migration, extract only the <code>CREATE INDEX</code> statements and adjust them to create the indexes <code>CONCURRENTLY</code>. Then, create the indexes manually and concurrently in the database. Since the full indexes are not dropped yet, they can still be used by queries so performance should not be impacted in the process. It is possible to <a href="https://hakibenita.com/how-to-create-django-index-without-downtime">create indexes concurrently in Django migrations</a>, but this time we decided it's best to do it manually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reset full index statistics counters</strong>: To make sure it's safe to drop the full indexes, we wanted to first make sure the new partial indexes are being used. To keep track of their use we reset the counters for the full indexes using <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-STATS-FUNCTIONS" rel="noopener"><code>pg_stat_reset_single_table_counters(&lt;full index oid&gt;)</code></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitor use of partial indexes</strong>: After reseting the stats we monitored both overall query performance and the partial index usage by observing the values of <code>idx_scan</code>, <code>idx_tup_read</code> and <code>idx_tup_fetch</code> in the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-ALL-INDEXES-VIEW" rel="noopener"><code>pg_stat_all_indexes</code></a> tables, for both the partial and the full indexes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drop the full indexes</strong>: Once we were convinced the partial indexes are being used, we dropped the full indexes. This is a good point to check the sizes of both partial and full indexes to find out exactly how much storage you  are about to free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fake the Django migration</strong>: Once the database state was effectively in-sync with the model state, we fake the migration using <code>./manage.py migrate --fake</code>. When faking a migration, Django will register the migration as executed, but it won't actually execute anything. This is useful for situations like this when you need better control over a migration process. Note that on other environments such as dev, QA or staging where there is not downtime considerations, the Django migrations will execute normally and the full indexes will be replaced with the partial ones. For more advanced Django migration operations such as "fake", check out <a href="https://hakibenita.com/move-django-model">How to Move a Django Model to Another App</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Optimizing disks, storage parameters and configuration can only affect performance so much. At some point, to squeeze that final drop of performance you need to make changes to the underlying objects. In this case, it was the index definition.</p>
<p>To sum up the process we took to clear an much storage as we could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove unused indexes</li>
<li>Repack tables and indexes (and activate B-Tree deduplication when possible)</li>
<li>Utilize partial indexes to index only what's necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully, after applying these techniques you can gain a few more days before you need to reach into your pocket and provision more storage.</p>

        <p>Our hosting set up is really simple: a few cloud servers behind a 
load balancer. Our customers send us more than 1,000 requests/second,
and it's important for deploys to have zero downtime. This is how we do it
using Hetzner cloud servers, load balancers, and our Ansible script.</p>
<p>Of course, you can skip all of this and
<a href="https://github.com/scratchdata/ScratchDB/blob/main/deploy/web.yaml">read the Ansible playbook</a> yourself.</p>
<h2>Deployment Steps</h2>
<p>For each server, our deploy has three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the server's /healthcheck endpoint to "unhealthy"</li>
<li>Wait for the loadbalancer to remove the server from the pool</li>
<li>Gracefully shutdown and redeploy the server</li>
</ol>
<p>What follows are code snippets for each of these steps.</p>
<h3>Set the server's /healthcheck to unhealthy</h3>
<p>At the start our Ansible deploy, we just upload a file called "unhealthy" to the server.
If that file is present, then the server will return a 500 error on its healthcheck.</p>
<pre><code>- name: Set server status to unhealthy
    copy:
    content: ""
    dest: ./unhealthy</code></pre>
<p>And the corresponding Go code. We're using the <a href="https://gofiber.io/">Fiber</a> 
web framework.</p>
<pre><code>func HealthCheck(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
    _, err := os.Stat("./unhealthy")

    if !os.IsNotExist(err) {
        return fiber.ErrBadGateway
    }

    return c.SendString("ok")
}</code></pre>
<h2>Wait for the load balancer to stop sending traffic</h2>
<p>The tricky part was #2 - there is not a straightforward Ansible module
to wait for the load balancer to stop sending traffic to the, node being
deployed. But we figured it out!</p>
<p>This makes use of two Hetzner API endpoints:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#server-metadata">Server Metadata</a>. This endpoint runs on the server 
   and returns information about itself: ip address, hostname, etc. In our case, we just wanted the
   <code>instance-id</code>, which is Hetzner's unique identifier for a server.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#load-balancers-get-a-load-balancer">Get Load Balancer</a>. This returns
   information about a load balancer, including each of its nodes and healthcheck status. We need the
   <code>instance-id</code> from step 1 to check the status in step 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>To get the <code>instance-id</code>, we run this Ansible stanza:</p>
<pre><code>- name: Get Hetzner server ID
  uri:
    url: "http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/instance-id"
    return_content: true
  register: server_id</code></pre>
<p>Now, this is the magic to wait for the LB to mark our server as unhealthy.
This is important because we want to make sure we aren't sending any traffic
before we deploy.</p>
<pre><code>- name: Wait for Hetzner to remove node from LB
  uri:
    url: "https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/load_balancers/{{hetzner_lb_id}}"
    return_content: true
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer {{hetzner_api_key}}"
  register: lb_response
  until: &gt;-
      (
      lb_response.json.load_balancer.targets
      | selectattr('server.id', '==', server_id.content | int)
      ).0.health_status.0.status == 'unhealthy'
  retries: 5
  delay: 5</code></pre>
<p>I couldn't have gotten this without help from this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/76988240/3788">StackOverflow</a>
answer. It is tricky, but here is how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fetches the status of the load balancer and stores the JSON API response into <code>lb_response</code></li>
<li>Uses <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/#jinja-filters.selectattr">Jinja's selectattr filter</a>
   to parse out the status of the specific server being deployed.</li>
<li>Checks to see if that status is unhealthy.</li>
<li>If this doesn't happen after 5 retries, cancel the deploy</li>
</ol>
<p>From here, we can safely shut down the server and proceed with our deploy.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We've been happy with Hetzner's servers, which are the best value options
we can find on the market today. With a little bit of cleverness we're able
to deploy our service, one node at a time, without any interruption in traffic.</p>

<p>If a thermometer is wrapped in a water-moistened cloth, it will behave differently. The drier and less humid the air is, the faster the water will evaporate.  The faster water evaporates, the lower the thermometer's temperature will be relative to air temperature.
</p><p>Water can evaporate only if the air around it can absorb more water. This is measured by comparing how much water is in the air to the maximum that could be in the air—the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_humidity" title="Relative humidity">relative humidity</a>. 0% means the air is completely dry, and 100% means the air contains all the water it can hold in the present circumstances and it cannot absorb any more water (from any source).
</p><p>This is part of the cause of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_temperature" title="Apparent temperature">apparent temperature</a> in humans. The drier the air, the more moisture it can take up beyond what is already in it, and the easier it is for extra water to evaporate. The result is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat" title="Sweat">sweat</a> evaporates more quickly in drier air, cooling down the skin faster. If the relative humidity is 100%, no water can evaporate, and cooling by sweating or evaporation is not possible.
</p><p>When relative humidity is 100%, a wet-bulb thermometer can also no longer be cooled by evaporation, so it will read the same as an unwrapped thermometer.

<h2><span id="General">General</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wet-bulb_temperature&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: General">edit</a><span>]</span></span></h2>

<p>The wet-bulb temperature is the lowest temperature that may be achieved by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporative_cooling" title="Evaporative cooling">evaporative cooling</a> of a water-wetted, ventilated surface.
</p><p>By contrast, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point" title="Dew point">dew point</a> is the temperature to which the ambient air must be cooled to reach 100% <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_humidity" title="Relative humidity">relative humidity</a> assuming there is no further evaporation into the air; it is the temperature where condensation (dew) and clouds would form.
</p><p>For a parcel of air that is less than saturated (i.e., air with less than 100 percent relative humidity), the wet-bulb temperature is lower than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry-bulb_temperature" title="Dry-bulb temperature">dry-bulb temperature</a>, but higher than the dew point temperature. The lower the relative humidity (the drier the air), the greater the gaps between each pair of these three temperatures. Conversely, when the relative humidity rises to 100%, the three figures coincide.
</p><p>For air at a known pressure and dry-bulb temperature, the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature corresponds to unique values of the relative humidity and the dew point temperature. It therefore may be used for the practical determination of these values. The relationships between these values are illustrated in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychrometric_chart" title="Psychrometric chart">psychrometric chart</a>.
</p><p>Lower wet-bulb temperatures that correspond with drier air in summer can translate to energy savings in air-conditioned buildings due to:

<p>The thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature is the temperature a volume of air would have if cooled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_process" title="Adiabatic process">adiabatically</a> to saturation by evaporation of water into it, all latent heat being supplied by the volume of air.
</p><p>The temperature of an air sample that has passed over a large surface of liquid water in an insulated channel is the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature—the air has become saturated by passing through a constant-pressure, ideal, adiabatic saturation chamber.
</p><p>Meteorologists and others may use the term "isobaric wet-bulb temperature" to refer to the "thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature".  It is also called the "adiabatic saturation temperature", though meteorologists also use "adiabatic saturation temperature" to mean "temperature at the saturation level", i.e. the temperature the parcel would achieve if it expanded adiabatically until saturated.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

<p>Wet-bulb temperature is measured using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometer" title="Thermometer">thermometer</a> that has its bulb wrapped in cloth—called a <i>sock</i>—that is kept wet with distilled water via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_action" title="Capillary action">wicking</a> action. Such an instrument is called a <i>wet-bulb thermometer.</i>  A widely used device for measuring wet- and dry-bulb temperature is a <i>sling psychrometer</i>, which consists of a pair of mercury bulb thermometers, one with a wet "sock" to measure the wet-bulb temperature and the other with the bulb exposed and dry for the dry-bulb temperature.  The thermometers are attached to a swivelling handle, which allows them to be whirled around so that water evaporates from the sock and cools the wet bulb until it reaches <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_equilibrium" title="Thermal equilibrium">thermal equilibrium</a>.
</p><p>An actual wet-bulb thermometer reads a temperature that is slightly different from the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature, but they are very close in value. This is due to a coincidence: for a water-air system the psychrometric ratio (see below) happens to be close to 1, although for systems other than air and water they might not be close.
</p><p>To understand why this is so, first consider the calculation of the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature.
</p><p><b>Experiment 1</b>
</p><p>In this case, a stream of unsaturated air is cooled. The heat from cooling that air is used to evaporate some water which increases the humidity of the air. At some point the air becomes saturated with water vapor (and has cooled to the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature). In this case we can write the following balance of energy per mass of dry air:
</p><div><p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/17ec8c5c9e299adfec2713eeee94c3689d20ec67" aria-hidden="true" alt="{\displaystyle (H_{\mathrm {sat} }-H_{0})\cdot \lambda =(T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {sat} })\cdot c_{\mathrm {s} }}"></p></div>


<p><b>Experiment 2</b>
</p><p>For the case of the wet-bulb thermometer, imagine a drop of water with unsaturated air blowing over it. As long as the vapor pressure of water in the drop (function of its temperature) is greater than the partial pressure of water vapor in the air stream, evaporation will take place. Initially, the heat required for the evaporation will come from the drop itself.
</p><p>Instead, as the drop starts cooling, it is now colder than the air, so convective heat transfer begins to occur from the air to the drop. Furthermore, the evaporation rate depends on the difference of concentration of water vapor between the drop-stream interface and the distant stream (i.e. the "original" stream, unaffected by the drop), and on a convective mass transfer coefficient, which is a function of the components of the mixture (i.e. water and air).
</p><p>After a certain period, an equilibrium is reached: the drop has cooled to a point where the rate of heat carried away in evaporation is equal to the heat gain through convection. At this point, the following balance of energy per interface area is true:
</p><div><p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4c40fedb288cdbbc365da7082c3c92a522a0d542" aria-hidden="true" alt="{\displaystyle (H_{\mathrm {sat} }-H_{0})\cdot \lambda \cdot k'=(T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {eq} })\cdot h_{\mathrm {c} }}"></p></div>


<p>Note that:
</p>

<p>Let us rearrange that equation into:
</p><div><p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9677e02c0523e01c6c5fee890b3c60a34b1146ec" aria-hidden="true" alt="{\displaystyle (H_{\mathrm {sat} }-H_{0})\cdot \lambda =(T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {eq} })\cdot {\frac {h_{\mathrm {c} }}{k'}}}"></p></div>
<p>Now let's go back to our original "thermodynamic wet-bulb" experiment, Experiment 1. If the air stream is the same in both experiments (i.e. <span><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/43910602a221b7a4c373791f94793e3008622070" aria-hidden="true" alt="H_{0}"></span> and <span><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/55b9e7d7b96196b5a6a26f4349caa3ac82fd67e3" aria-hidden="true" alt="T_{0}"></span> are the same), then we can equate the right-hand sides of both equations:
</p><div><p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/963f05fa9fd90a71ff3e8d3eb21778fd8092f54b" aria-hidden="true" alt="{\displaystyle (T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {sat} })\cdot c_{\mathrm {s} }=(T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {eq} })\cdot {\frac {h_{\mathrm {c} }}{k'}}}"></p></div>
<p>Rearranging:
</p><div><p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2c6a080ad8026b95468628f27d101d9b053f475f" aria-hidden="true" alt="{\displaystyle T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {sat} }=(T_{0}-T_{\mathrm {eq} })\cdot {\frac {h_{\mathrm {c} }}{k'\cdot c_{\mathrm {s} }}}}"></p></div>
<p>If <span><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/138cb3443a730d751f0d02bef57f6645dade10c5" aria-hidden="true" alt="{\dfrac {h_{\mathrm {c} }}{k'c_{\mathrm {s} }}}=1"></span> then the temperature of the drop in Experiment 2 is the same as the wet-bulb temperature in Experiment 1. Due to a coincidence, for the mixture of air and water vapor this is the case, the ratio (called <i>psychrometric ratio</i>) being close to 1.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>Experiment 2 is what happens in a common wet-bulb thermometer, meaning that its reading is fairly close to the thermodynamic ("real") wet-bulb temperature.
</p><p>Experimentally, the wet-bulb thermometer reads closest to the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature if:
</p>
<ul><li>The sock is shielded from radiant heat exchange with its surroundings</li>
<li>Air flows past the sock quickly enough to prevent evaporated moisture from affecting evaporation from the sock</li>
<li>The water supplied to the sock is at the same temperature as the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature of the air</li></ul>
<p>In practice the value reported by a wet-bulb thermometer differs slightly from the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature because:
</p>
<ul><li>The sock is not perfectly shielded from radiant heat exchange</li>
<li>Air flow rate past the sock may be less than optimum</li>
<li>The temperature of the water supplied to the sock is not controlled</li></ul>
<p>At relative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity" title="Humidity">humidities</a> below 100 percent, water <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporates" title="Evaporates">evaporates</a> from the bulb, cooling it below ambient temperature. To determine relative humidity, ambient temperature is measured using an ordinary thermometer, better known in this context as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry-bulb_temperature" title="Dry-bulb temperature">dry-bulb thermometer</a>. At any given ambient temperature, less relative humidity results in a greater difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures; the wet-bulb is colder. The precise relative humidity is determined by reading from a  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychrometric_chart" title="Psychrometric chart">psychrometric chart</a> of wet-bulb versus dry-bulb temperatures, or by calculation.
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychrometer" title="Psychrometer">Psychrometers</a> are instruments with both a wet-bulb and a dry-bulb thermometer.
</p><p>A wet-bulb thermometer can also be used outdoors in sunlight in combination with a <i>globe thermometer</i> (which measures the incident <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_radiant_temperature" title="Mean radiant temperature">radiant temperature</a>) to calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_Bulb_Globe_Temperature" title="Wet Bulb Globe Temperature">Wet Bulb Globe Temperature</a> (WBGT).

</p><p>"The relationship between the isobaric and adiabatic processes is quite obscure. Comparisons indicate, however, that the two temperatures are rarely different by more than a few  tenths of a degree Celsius, and the adiabatic version is always the smaller of the two for unsaturated air.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-testid="paragraph-0">SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TSLA.O" target="_blank">(TSLA.O)</a> is set to defend itself for the first time at trial against allegations that failure of its Autopilot driver assistant feature led to death, in what will likely be a major test of Chief Executive Elon Musk's assertions about the technology.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-1">Self-driving capability is central to Tesla’s financial future, <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-says-tesla-likely-launch-full-self-drive-technology-this-year-2023-04-20/">according to Musk,</a> whose own reputation as an engineering leader is being challenged with allegations by plaintiffs in one of two lawsuits that he personally leads the group behind technology that failed. Wins by Tesla could raise confidence and sales for the software, which costs up to $15,000 per vehicle.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">Tesla faces two trials in quick succession, with more to follow.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-3">The first, scheduled for mid-September in a California state court, is a civil lawsuit containing allegations that the Autopilot system caused owner Micah Lee’s Model 3 to suddenly veer off a highway east of Los Angeles at 65 miles per hour, strike a palm tree and burst into flames, all in the span of seconds.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">The 2019 crash, which has not been previously reported, killed Lee and seriously injured his two passengers, including a then-8-year old boy who was disemboweled. The lawsuit, filed against Tesla by the passengers and Lee's estate, accuses Tesla of knowing that Autopilot and other safety systems were defective when it sold the car.</p><h2 data-testid="Heading">MUSK 'DE FACTO LEADER' OF AUTOPILOT TEAM</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-5">The second trial, set for early October in a Florida state court, arose out of a 2019 crash north of Miami where owner Stephen Banner’s Model 3 drove under the trailer of an 18-wheeler big rig truck that had pulled into the road, shearing off the Tesla's roof and killing Banner. Autopilot failed to brake, steer or do anything to avoid the collision, according to the lawsuit filed by Banner's wife.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">Tesla denied liability for both accidents, blamed driver error and said Autopilot is safe when monitored by humans. Tesla said in court documents that drivers must pay attention to the road and keep their hands on the steering wheel.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">"There are no self-driving cars on the road today," the company said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">The civil proceedings will likely reveal new evidence about what Musk and other company officials knew about Autopilot’s capabilities – and any possible deficiencies. Banner’s attorneys, for instance, argue in a pretrial court filing that internal emails show Musk is the Autopilot team's "de facto leader".</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">Tesla and Musk did not respond to Reuters’ emailed questions for this article, but Musk has made no secret of his involvement in self-driving software engineering, often tweeting about his test-driving of a Tesla equipped with "Full Self-Driving" software. He has for years promised that Tesla would achieve self-driving capability only to miss his own targets.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">Tesla <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-jury-set-decide-test-case-tesla-autopilot-crash-2023-04-21/">won a bellwether trial</a> in Los Angeles in April with a strategy of saying that it tells drivers that its technology requires human monitoring, despite the "Autopilot" and "Full Self-Driving" names. The case was about an accident where a Model S swerved into the curb and injured its driver, <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-autopilot-never-claimed-be-self-pilot-juror-2023-04-21/https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-autopilot-never-claimed-be-self-pilot-juror-2023-04-21/" target="_blank">and jurors told Reuters</a> after the verdict that they believed Tesla warned drivers about its system and driver distraction was to blame.</p><h2 data-testid="Heading">STAKES HIGHER FOR TESLA</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-11">The stakes for Tesla are much higher in the September and October trials, the first of a series related to Autopilot this year and next, because people died.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">"If Tesla backs up a lot of wins in these cases, I think they're going to get more favorable settlements in other cases," said Matthew Wansley, a former General Counsel of nuTonomy, an automated driving startup and Associate Professor of Law at Cardozo School of Law.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">On the other hand, "a big loss for Tesla - especially with a big damages award" could "dramatically shape the narrative going forward," said Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">In court filings, the company has argued that Lee consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel and that it is not clear whether Autopilot was on at the time of crash.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">Jonathan Michaels, an attorney for the plaintiffs, declined to comment on Tesla’s specific arguments, but said "we're fully aware of Tesla's false claims including their shameful attempts to blame the victims for their known defective autopilot system."</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">In the Florida case, Banner's attorneys also filed a motion arguing punitive damages were warranted. The attorneys have deposed several Tesla executives and received internal documents from the company that they said show Musk and engineers were aware of, and did not fix, shortcomings.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-17">In one deposition, former executive <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-tells-regulator-that-full-self-driving-cars-may-not-be-achieved-by-year-2021-05-07/">Christopher Moore</a> testified there are limitations to Autopilot, saying it "is not designed to detect every possible hazard or every possible obstacle or vehicle that could be on the road," according to a transcript reviewed by Reuters.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-18">In 2016, a few months after a fatal accident where a Tesla crashed into a semi-trailer truck, Musk told reporters that the automaker was updating Autopilot with improved radar sensors that likely would have prevented the fatality.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-19">But Adam (Nicklas) Gustafsson, a Tesla Autopilot systems engineer who investigated both accidents in Florida, said that in the almost three years between that 2016 crash and Banner’s accident, no changes were made to Autopilot’s systems to account for cross-traffic, according to court documents submitted by plaintiff lawyers.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-20">The lawyers tried to blame the lack of change on Musk. "Elon Musk has acknowledged problems with the Tesla autopilot system not working properly," according to plaintiffs' documents. Former Autopilot engineer Richard Baverstock, who was also deposed, stated that "almost everything" he did at Tesla was done at the request of "Elon," according to the documents.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-21">Tesla filed an emergency motion in court late on Wednesday seeking to keep deposition transcripts of its employees and other documents secret. Banner’s attorney, Lake "Trey" Lytal III, said he would oppose the motion.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-22">"The great thing about our judicial system is Billion Dollar Corporations can only keep secrets for so long," he wrote in a text message.</p><p data-testid="Body">Reporting by Dan Levine and Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco, Editing by Peter Henderson and Grant McCool</p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

Their search was fruitless and they looked to outside experts for help.</p><p>“Canberra is a small place, so we sent the worm, which was still alive, straight to the laboratory of a CSIRO scientist who is very experienced with parasites,” Senanayake said. “He just looked at it and said, ‘Oh my goodness, this is <em>Ophidascaris robertsi</em>’.”</p><p><em>Ophidascaris robertsi</em> is a roundworm usually found in pythons. The Canberra hospital patient marks the world-first case of the parasite being found in humans.</p><p>The patient resides near a lake area inhabited by carpet pythons. Despite no direct snake contact, she often collected native grasses, including warrigal greens, from around the lake to use in cooking, Senanayake said.</p><p>The doctors and scientists involved in her case hypothesise that a python may have shed the parasite via its faeces into the grass. They believe the patient was probably infected with the parasite directly from touching the native grass or after eating the greens.</p><p>Senanayake said the patient needed to be treated for other larvae that might have invaded other parts of her body, such as the liver. But given no patient had ever been treated for the parasite before, care was taken. Some medications for example could trigger inflammation as the larvae died off. An inflammation can be harmful to organs such as the brain, so they also needed to administer medications to counteract any dangerous side-effects.</p><figure id="771e23b8-7288-424a-95bb-8aaad0faf990" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47e92ba069a49f6113b7f927dd2a682cafef75d1/1193_1561_2355_1413/master/2355.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47e92ba069a49f6113b7f927dd2a682cafef75d1/1193_1561_2355_1413/master/2355.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47e92ba069a49f6113b7f927dd2a682cafef75d1/1193_1561_2355_1413/master/2355.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47e92ba069a49f6113b7f927dd2a682cafef75d1/1193_1561_2355_1413/master/2355.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47e92ba069a49f6113b7f927dd2a682cafef75d1/1193_1561_2355_1413/master/2355.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47e92ba069a49f6113b7f927dd2a682cafef75d1/1193_1561_2355_1413/master/2355.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A carpet python" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47e92ba069a49f6113b7f927dd2a682cafef75d1/1193_1561_2355_1413/master/2355.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A carpet python – the more conventional host for  <em>Ophidascaris robertsi</em>.</span> Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAP</figcaption></figure><p>“That poor patient, she was so courageous and wonderful,” Senanayake said. “You don’t want to be the first patient in the world with a roundworm found in pythons and we really take our hats off to her.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>My software developer colleagues often ask me where I do get all the time for reading all the tech books or articles, watching conference talks and listening to podcasts. I analyzed my consumption for November and December and here is, what I did (and that’s only the tech related content):</p>
<ul>
<li>Listened to 7 podcast episodes: 5 hours</li>
<li>Listened to 1/2 of an audiobook: 7 hours</li>
<li>Watched 6 videos talks from some conferences: 6 hours</li>
<li>Read 3 books: 12 hours</li>
<li>Read plenty of articles on the internet and offline medium: 30 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, that’s 60 hours for two months (that seems huge) and 30 hours per months (seems reasonable), which means around 7 hours per week (seems doable) and 1 hour per day (that sounds easy!).</p>
<p>That’s <strong>one hour</strong> per day that has to be available for learning!</p>
<p>“Wait a minute! Should I sacrifice one hour of my precious spare time for learning things that I need for work? No way!!!”</p>
<p>You don’t have to (because you need that time for writing blog posts, coding and to prepare conference talks!)! It’s not “free time” aka time where I can do what I want (for parents: care and play with the children 😉 ). It’s the time between working hours, free time and sleeping time. Let’s call it “duty time” (isn’t there a better term for that?). Duty time is the time that we have to spent for going to work, purchase food, cook dinner, going to sleep and so on – all activities we have to do besides your primary work.</p>
<p><strong>The trick is to refine some of the duty time to learning time!<br>
</strong></p>
<p>For example, I’m commuting every day 2×45 minutes to my workplace and back home. I need</p>
<ul>
<li>5 minutes to get to the train station with my bike</li>
<li>10 minutes to wait for the (connecting) trains</li>
<li>25 minutes actually on the trains</li>
<li>5 minutes to get from the train to my working place</li>
</ul>
<p>…and vice versa. That alone makes 90 minutes of duty time per day! Or 80 almost freely available learning time (I don’t like listening to podcasts while I’m riding my bike, which makes 10 minutes that I can’t use per day)!</p>
<p>I also love cooking (but I also have to clean up the kitchen afterward 🙁 ). Let’s say that takes me 40 minutes: 40 minutes duty time = 40 minutes time for watching videos of conference talks.</p>
<p>If I want to, I read in the evening (ok, that’s free time, so it doesn’t count) or listen to an audiobook to calm down or before falling asleep (yes, that’s also duty time!). That gives me easily another 30 minutes per day for free!</p>
<p>So I can easily transform 2.5 hours of duty time per day that I can use for at least 1 hour of learning time. I don’t even have to use half of the available time (that’s good because I’m not good at listening while I cope vegetables with a sharp knife)!</p>
<p>I think it also depends on the right tools for using the duty time efficiently, too. For example, I can’t do any housekeeping fully cabled or with a stationary desktop PC. So I’ve invested some money in optimizing my media consumption:</p>
<ul>
<li>A small tablet (Dell Venue 8 Pro) for watching talks while working in the kitchen and traveling by train (luckily, a few sites allow you to download videos for offline viewing)</li>
<li>A smartphone with plenty of storage (Nexus 5, 32 GB) with a very good podcast app (Podcast Republic)</li>
<li>Two (because one for spare if the other is charging 😉 )Bluetooth headphones (Philips SHB4000) for high quality, interruption free listening. I use them if I’m doing something alone or nobody in my family has to talk with me.</li>
<li>Wired Earphones with a good noise shielding capabilities.</li>
<li>A Bluetooth headset (Plantronics M55) and (since a week) bone conduction headphones (Aftershokz Sportz 3). That’s great if you still want to understand somebody while listening to something.</li>
<li>Some Bluetooth transmitters (CSL Bluetooth transmitter) for connecting non-Bluetooth audio devices to my Bluetooth headphones.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I’m on the move, I mostly use my smartphone and the wired earphones. At home, it depends: If the kids are around while I’m doing work, I use the headset or bone conduction headphones, otherwise the headsets.</p>
<p>I also think it doesn’t matter that you’re 100% concentrated on all the stuff you consume this way. You’ll always get the key facts or main ideas. Really important information will be spared to be consumed in my free time anyway (because it’s worthwhile). For important stuff, I also write down some notes in a notebook that I have almost always on me. These notes will be (hopefully) featured in some upcoming blog posts.</p>
<p>There is plenty of time out there that wants to be spent well!</p>
<p>Update August 2023: I still do it this way and can keep up with the news in IT and more. What I would now also recommend: Practice listening to audio in at least twice the speed as the original! To get used to that, increase the speed every month by +0.1x !</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>When I first told my readers about an Austin-made Tesla Model Y with a cracked front casting, the owner had yet to confirm how serious the problem was. It did not take long: apart from using a flashlight and a mechanic pick to show it affected more than the skinny paint that component has, NK also told me more about his lengthy struggle to correct his brand-new Model Y – which led to a more extensive investigation.</p><div><p>
		The electric <span data-url="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/s.html#ge-sport-utility-vehicle" title="SUV - click for definition">SUV</span> owner told me he still prefers that I use only his initials and his other nickname (Cracked_Tesla) because he wants to give another <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/Tesla%20Service%20Center/">Tesla Service Center</a> a chance to do the right thing. Believe me: NK is spending a lot of energy to get a proper response from the battery electric vehicle (<span data-url="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/b.html#ge-battery-electric-vehicle" title="BEV - click for definition">BEV</span>) maker. The Model Y owner discovered the issue in May, two months after taking delivery of the vehicle. It is his first Tesla.</p><p>

<em>"At delivery, I inspected the car based on the main things other owners said to check. At the time, everything was fine, but I did not check the frame or structural members, as the car was new from the factory, and one shouldn't have to check that."</em></p><div><a id="xaegal_11" href="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/gallery/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting_11.jpg" onclick="return open_lght(11, this)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images-webp/news-gallery-860x/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting-thumbnail_11.jpg.webp"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting-thumbnail_11.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting-thumbnail_11.jpg" width="860" height="484" alt="Tesla Model Y owner wants to discover if other Austin\-made units also have cracked front castings" title="Tesla Model Y owner wants to discover if other Austin\-made units also have cracked front castings" data-gidm="1932617" data-gida="220165" data-gidx="17"></picture></a><p>Photo: NK/Cracked_Tesla</p></div>
<p>
NK denied his car was ever involved in any collisions. Ironically, he discovered the cracked front casting when he was investigating another serious issue that his <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/Tesla%20Model%20Y/">Model Y</a> could present: a missing brake fluid reservoir cap. Believe it or not, for anyone to check if the brake fluid reservoir is in place, they will have to remove the plastic cover on the base of the windscreen. The second embedded video here shows that on a Model 3, which shares several components with the electric SUV.</p><p>

<em>"I saw this post <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/13nbeo8/missing_brake_fluid_cap/">on Reddit</a> and thought it was extremely dangerous if there was no cap to the brake fluid. And based on Tesla's track record of issues, I had to check my car."<br>
</em><br>
An open brake fluid reservoir is a death trap: the vehicle can either lose brake fluid, or this substance may absorb moisture as time goes by, which will make the brakes fail. As much as a Tesla may have regenerative braking, it is not enough to stop the car in emergencies. If it were, the BEV maker would have found a way to eliminate it and save some bucks, rest assured. Cracked_Tesla's car had the cap, but its front casting was cracked, as the images I've published in my first article show.</p><p>

<em>"May is when I first saw the cracks and submitted the service request. I was not able to take the car to the service center until July, so that's when the whole saga began."</em></p><div><a id="xaegal_4" href="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/gallery/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting_4.jpg" onclick="return open_lght(4, this)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images-webp/news-gallery-860x/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting-thumbnail_4.jpg.webp"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting-thumbnail_4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting-thumbnail_4.jpg" width="860" height="484" alt="There's a flashlight behind this cracked front casting, as the light denounces" title="There's a flashlight behind this cracked front casting, as the light denounces" data-gidm="1932610" data-gida="220165" data-gidx="5"></picture></a><p>Photo: NK/Cracked_Tesla</p></div>
<p>
I'd count all four months since the issue was discovered, but NK generously says he has been dealing with the problem with Tesla for the last two. If the company had offered to correct that right from the start, we probably would have never heard of the flaw. Unfortunately, that was not how Tesla decided to deal with NK's concerns.</p><p>

<em>"The manager of the service center said multiple times that 'the car is safe to drive' and that he had been assured by 'engineers' that it is 'safe.' However, he will not give me anything in more detail or any official Tesla documentation to confirm that."</em></p><p>

The <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/Tesla%20Files/">Tesla Files</a> episode revealed that the BEV maker instructs its technicians always to provide feedback orally. Internal documents obtained by Handelsblatt stated: <em>"Do not copy the report below into an email, text message, or leave it in a voicemail to the customer."</em> That was not acceptable for NK, notably after he managed to see and film light beams from his flashlight crossing the cracked front casting. You can check the video below, which Cracked_Tesla published on his YouTube channel and allowed me to embed in this article.</p><div><a id="xaegal_6" href="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/gallery/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting_6.jpg" onclick="return open_lght(6, this)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images-webp/news-gallery-860x/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting-thumbnail_6.jpg.webp"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting-thumbnail_6.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/new-images-and-video-confirm-austin-made-tesla-model-y-has-cracked-front-casting-thumbnail_6.jpg" width="860" height="484" alt="There's a flashlight behind this cracked front casting, as the light denounces" title="There's a flashlight behind this cracked front casting, as the light denounces" data-gidm="1932612" data-gida="220165" data-gidx="7"></picture></a><p>Photo: NK/Cracked_Tesla</p></div>
<p>
Pay careful attention to the area of the crack right below where it bifurcates. The flashlight shines there right at the beginning of the video. I recommend you watch this on your cellphone, where the video format is more favorable. It leaves no doubt about how deep the damage is. The mechanic pick was not even necessary to confirm the issue, but NK used it as well.</p><p>

<em>"I was shocked, scared, and nervous for my safety as it is my only method of transportation."</em></p><p>

So far, Cracked_Tesla has not heard of any other cases like the one involving his <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/BEV/">BEV</a>. Although even the Model Y owner wishes his car to be the only one affected, that is very unlikely. Giga Grünheide faced 60% of rejected cast parts about a year ago. There are pictures of these rejected parts pilling up in Fremont. If NK's Model Y received a component that should also have been discarded by quality control, others may have reached production units as well.</p><p>

NK's alert should get Austin-made BEV owners to verify that. If you repair <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/Tesla/">Tesla</a> vehicles and have ever seen anything like this, please let NK and me know. If the BEV maker is so sure that this is not serious, it should provide Cracked_Tesla at least with a document that gives him some peace of mind. I'll let you know about all the developments this story may have. <i></i></p><iframe width="480" height="857" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Aspt2QM7waM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J03NDWdm2Xg" data-embed="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J03NDWdm2Xg?wmode=transparent" target="_blank" title="Click to play video"><img alt="Video thumbnail" data-gidx="-1" width="480" height="360" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi_webp/J03NDWdm2Xg/hqdefault.webp"><span><i></i></span></a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>My current day job is now again a C++ role. And so, I find myself again
focusing in this blog post on the downsides of C++.</p>
<p>Overall, I have found returning to active C++ dev to be exactly what
I expected: I still have the skills, and can still be effective in it,
but now that I have worked in a more modern programming language with
less legacy cruft, the downsides of C++ sting more. There are so many
features I miss from Rust, not only the obvious safety features, or even
primarily those, but also features that C++ could easily add, like sum
types (called <code>enum</code>s in Rust), or first-class support for tuples.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I will focus on the minor problems of C++ that
have affected me the most, the little usability <em>papercuts</em>, the petty
inconveniences that just waste time. Instead of focusing on comparing
them to Rust or other programming languages, I will focus on why they
don’t make sense from a C++ point of view, with reference to just C++.
I know better than to hope that by doing this that die-hard C++ fans will
accept my criticism, but perhaps it will be relatable to C++ programmers
who don’t have Rust experience.</p>
<p>Before I start getting into the papercuts, though, I want to address
one of the primary defenses I’ve seen of C++, one that I’ve found
particularly baffling. It goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C++ is a great programming language. The complaints are just from
people who aren’t up to it. If they were better programmers,
they’d appreciate the C++ way of doing things, and they wouldn’t
need their hand-held. Languages like Rust are not helpful for
such true professionals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, the phrasing is a bit of a parody, but I’ve seen this
sort of attitude so many times. The most charitable view I can take
of it is a claim that C++’s difficulty is a sign of its power, and
the natural cost of using a powerful programming language. What it
reads like to me in many cases, however, is as a form of elitism:
a general idea that making things easy for poorer programmers is
pointless, and that good programmers don’t benefit from making
things easier.</p>
<p>As someone who has programmed C++ professionally for a majority of my
career, and who has taught (company-internal) classes in advanced C++,
this is nonsense to me. I do know how to navigate the many papercuts
and foot-guns of C++, and am happy to do so when working on a C++
codebase. But experienced as I am, they still slow me down and
distract me, taking focus away from the actual problems I’m trying
to solve, and resulting in less maintainable code.</p>
<p>And as for the upside, I see very little – any way in which C++ is
more performant or more appropriate than Rust is in terms of platform
support, legacy codebases, optimizations that are only available in
specific compilers that happen to not support Rust, or other concerns
irrelevant to the actual design of the programming language.</p>
<p>While I am proud of my C++ skills, I am not too proud to appreciate
that better technology can render them partially obsolete. I am not
too proud to appreciate having features that make it easier. In most
cases, it’s not a matter of the programming language doing more work
for me, but of C++ creating unnecessary extra make-work, often
due to decisions that made sense when they were made, but have long
since stopped making sense – don’t get me started on header files!</p>
<p>But I also want my programming language to be beginner-friendly. I am
always going to work with other programmers with a variety of skill-sets,
and I would rather not have to clean up my colleagues' mistakes –
or mistakes of earlier, more foolish versions of myself. If making a
programming language more beginner-friendly sacrifices power, then I
agree that some programming languages should not do it. But many, even
most of C++’s beginner-unfriendly (and expert-annoying) features do not
in fact make the language more powerful.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, here are the biggest papercuts I’ve noticed
in the past month of returning to C++ development.</p>
<h2 id="const-is-not-the-default"><code>const</code> is not the default<a href="#const-is-not-the-default" arialabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>It is very easy to forget to mark a parameter <code>const</code> when it can be.
You can just forget to type the keyword. This is especially true for
<code>this</code>, which is an implicit parameter: there is no time when you are
typing out the <code>this</code> parameter explicitly, and therefore it won’t sit
there looking funny without the appropriate modifiers.</p>
<p>If C++ had the opposite default, where every value, reference, and pointer
was <code>const</code> unless explicitly declared mutable, then we’d be much more
likely to have every parameter declared correctly based on whether the
function needs to mutate it or not. If someone includes a <code>mutable</code> keyword,
it would be because they know they need it. If they need it and forget it,
the compiler error would remind them.</p>
<p>Now, you might not think this is important, because you can just not
use <code>const</code> and have functions with capabilities they don’t need –
but sometimes you have to take things by <code>const</code> in C++. If you take a
parameter by non-<code>const</code> reference, the caller can only use lvalues to
call your function. But if you take a parameter by <code>const</code> reference,
the caller can use lvalues or rvalues.  So some functions, in order to
be used in natural ways, must take their parameters by <code>const</code> reference.</p>
<p>Once you have a <code>const</code> reference, you can only (easily) call functions
with it that accept <code>const</code> references, and so if any of those functions
forgot to declare the parameter <code>const</code>, you have to include a <code>const_cast</code>
– or go change the function later to correctly accept <code>const</code>.</p>
<p>Lest you think this is just a sloppy newbie error, note that
many functions in the standard library had to be updated to take
<code>const_iterator</code> instead of or in addition to <code>iterator</code> when it was
discovered correctly that they made sense with a <code>const_iterator</code>:
functions like <code>erase</code>. It turns out that for functions like <code>erase</code>,
the collection is what has to be mutable, not the iterator – a fact
that the maintainers of the C++ library simply got wrong at first.</p>
<h2 id="obligatory-copying">Obligatory Copying<a href="#obligatory-copying" arialabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>In C++, for an object to be copyable is the default, privileged way
for an object to behave. If you don’t want your object to be copyable,
and all its fields are copyable, you often have to mark the copy constructor
and copy assignment operator as <code>= delete</code>. The default is for the compiler
to write code for you – code that can be incorrect.</p>
<p>If you do make your class move-only, however, beware, because
that means that there are situations where you can’t use
it. In C++11, there is no ergonomic way to do a lambda capture
by move – which is usually how I want to capture variables
into a closure.</p>
<p>Similarly, <code>std::function</code> expects the object it manages
to be copyable, and will fail to compile if your closure
object is move-only. This is going to be addressed in C++23, with
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/move_only_function/move_only_function"><code>std::move_only_function</code></a>
– but in the meantime, I have been forced to write classes with a copy
constructor that throws some sort of run-time logic exception.
And even in C++23, copyable functions will be the default, assumed
situation.</p>
<p>This is strange, because most complicated objects, especially closures,
are never, and should never be, copied. Generally, copying a complicated
data structure is a mistake – a missing <code>&amp;</code>, or a missing <code>std::move</code>.
But it is a mistake that carries no warning with it, and no visible
sign in the code that a complex, allocation-heavy action is being
undertaken. This is an early lesson to new C++ devs – don’t pass
non-primitive types by value – but it’s possible for even advanced devs
to mess up from time to time, and once it’s in the codebase, it’s easy
to miss.</p>
<h2 id="by-reference-parameter-papercuts">By-Reference Parameter Papercuts<a href="#by-reference-parameter-papercuts" arialabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>It is unergonomic to return multiple values by tuple in C++. It can be
done, but the calls to <code>std::tie</code> and <code>std::make_tuple</code> are long-winded
and distracting, not to mention that you’ll be writing unidiomatically,
which is always bad for people who are reading and debugging your code. As
a result, C++ often resorts to out parameters. In this as well as other
situations, you end up taking a parameter by non-<code>const</code> reference,
meaning the function is supposed to modify the parameter.</p>
<p>The problem is, this is only marked in the function signature. If you
have a function that takes a parameter by reference, the parameter looks
the same as a by-value parameter at the call site:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>// Return false on failure. Modify size with actual message size,
// decreasing it if it contains more than one message.
bool got_message(const char *void mesg, size_t &amp;size);

size_t size = buff.size();
got_message(buff.data(), size);
buff.resize(size);
</code></pre><p>If you’re reading the calling code quickly, it might look like the
<code>resize</code> call is redundant, but it is not. <code>size</code> is being modified by
<code>got_message</code>, and the only way to know that it is being modified is to
look at the function signature, which is usually in another file.</p>
<p>Some people prefer out parameters and in-out parameters to be passed
by pointer for this very reason:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>bool got_message(const char *void mesg, size_t *size);

size_t size = buff.size();
got_message(buff.data(), &amp;size);
buff.resize(size);
</code></pre><p>This is great – or would be, if pointers weren’t nullable. What does
a <code>nullptr</code> parameter mean in this context? Is it going to trigger
undefined behavior? What if you pass a pointer from a caller into it?
People often forget to document what functions do with a null pointer.</p>
<p>This can be addressed with a non-nullable smart pointer, but very
few programmers actually do this in practice. When something isn’t
the default, it tends to not be used everywhere where appropriate.
The sustainable answer to this is changing the default, not heroic
attempts to fight human nature.</p>
<p>Obligatory side-gripe:
At least in non-owning situations like this, it is possible to write
such a smart pointer. However, if you want to write the obvious companion,
a non-nullable owning smart pointer, a companion version of <code>std::unique_ptr</code>,
then it cannot be done in a useful way, because such a pointer cannot
then <a href="https://www.thecodedmessage.com/posts/cpp-move/">be moveable</a>.</p>
<h2 id="method-implementations-can-contradict">Method Implementations Can Contradict<a href="#method-implementations-can-contradict" arialabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>In C++, every time you write a class, especially a lower-level one,
you have a responsibility to make decisions about certain methods with
special semantic importance in the programming language:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Constructor (Copy):</strong> <code>X(const X&amp;)</code></li>
<li><strong>Constructor (Move):</strong> <code>X(X&amp;&amp;)</code></li>
<li><strong>Assignment (Copy):</strong> <code>operator=(const X&amp;)</code></li>
<li><strong>Assignment (Move):</strong> <code>operator=(X&amp;&amp;)</code></li>
<li><strong>Destructor:</strong> <code>~X()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For many classes, the default implementations are enough, and if
possible you should rely on them. Whether or not this is possible
depends on whether naively copying all of the fields is a sensible
way to copy the entire object, which is surprisingly easy to forget
to consider.</p>
<p>But if you need a custom implementation of one of these, you are on
the hook to write all of them. This is known as the “rule of 5.”
You have to write all of them, even though the correct behavior of the
two assignment operators can be completely determined by the
appropriate constructor combined with the destructor. The compiler could
make default implementations of the assignment operators that refer to
those other functions, and therefore would always be correct, but it
does not. Implementing them correctly is tricky, requiring techniques
like either explicitly protecting against self-assignment, or swapping
with a by-value parameter. In any case, they are boilerplate, and yet
another thing that can go wrong in a programming language that has many
such things.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" arialabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I am all too well aware of why these decisions were
made, and it is exactly one reason: Compatibility with legacy code.
C++ has no editions system, no way to deprecate core language
features.  If a new edition of C++ was made, it would <a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang">cease to be
C++</a> – though I
support the efforts of people to transition C++ to new syntax
and clean some of this stuff up.</p>
<p>However, if you ignore backwards-compatibility and the large existing
codebases, none of these papercuts make the programming language more
powerful or better, just harder to use. I’ve seen good-faith arguments
in favor of human-maintained header files, surprising as that is to me, but I
challenge my readers to tell me what is beneficial about C++’s design
choices in these matters.</p>
<p>You might find these things trivial, but these all slow programmers
down, while simultaneously annoying them. If you are experienced enough,
your subconscious might be adept at navigating it, but imagine what your
subconscious could do if it didn’t have to. But how adept are you at seeing
these mistakes in a code review from your junior colleagues? If you are a
rigorous reviewer, how much more time does it take? How adept are you at
finding these issues quickly when a bug arises?</p>
<p>We’d be more effective, more efficient, and happier if these issues were
resolved. Programming would be both enjoyable and faster to do.
What’s the downside? The only upside is continuity with history.
And while I can see the value in that, it is a very limited value,
with very limited scope.</p>

<small><a href="https://vitalik.ca/index.html">See all posts</a></small></p><title> What do I think about Community Notes? </title>

<p><em>Special thanks to Dennis Pourteaux and Jay Baxter for feedback and review.</em></p>
<p>The last two years of <s>Twitter</s> X have been tumultuous, to say the least. After the platform was <s><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-twitter-set-accept-musks-best-final-offer-sources-2022-04-25/">bought</a></s> <s><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/06/technology/elon-musk-twitter.html">not bought</a></s> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/elon-musk-twitter-deal-complete.html">bought</a> by Elon Musk for $44 billion last year, Elon enacted sweeping changes to the company's <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/11/04/twitter-temporarily-closes-offices-as-elon-musk-begins-mass-layoffs">staffing</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/29/1139822833/twitter-covid-misinformation-policy-not-enforced">content moderation</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/12/1139619598/twitter-blue-relaunch">business model</a>, not to mention changes to the culture on the site that may well have been a result of Elon's soft power more than any specific policy decision. But in the middle of these highly contentious actions, one new feature on Twitter grew rapidly in importance, and seems to be beloved by people across the political spectrum: Community Notes.</p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1597170780130852864">
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/elonnote.png"></p>
</center>
</a>
<p>Community Notes is a fact-checking tool that sometimes attaches context notes, like the one on Elon's tweet above, to tweets as a fact-checking and anti-misinformation tool. It was originally called Birdwatch, and was first rolled out as a pilot project in January 2021. Since then, it has expanded in stages, with the most rapid phase of its expansion coinciding with Twitter's takeover by Elon last year. Today, Community Notes appear frequently on tweets that get a very large audience on Twitter, including those on contentious political topics. And both in my view, and in the view of many people across the political spectrum I talk to, the notes, when they appear, are informative and valuable.</p>
<p>But what interests me most about Community Notes is how, despite not being a "crypto project", it might be the closest thing to an instantiation of "crypto values" that we have seen in the mainstream world. Community Notes are not written or curated by some centrally selected set of experts; rather, they can be written and voted on by anyone, and which notes are shown or not shown is decided entirely by an <a href="https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes">open source</a> algorithm. The Twitter site has a <a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/about/introduction">detailed and extensive guide</a> describing how the algorithm works, and you can <a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/download-data">download the data</a> containing which notes and votes have been published, run <a href="https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes/tree/main/sourcecode">the algorithm</a> locally, and verify that the output matches what is visible on the Twitter site. It's not perfect, but it's surprisingly close to satisfying the ideal of <a href="https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/">credible neutrality</a>, all while being impressively useful, even under contentious conditions, at the same time.</p>

<p>Anyone with a Twitter account <a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/contributing/signing-up">matching some criteria</a> (basically: active for 6+ months, no recent rule violations, verified phone number) can sign up to participate in Community Notes. Currently, participants are slowly and randomly being accepted, but eventually the plan is to let in anyone who fits the criteria. Once you are accepted, you can at first participate in rating existing notes, and once you've made enough good ratings (<a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/contributor-scores">measured by</a> seeing which ratings match with the final outcome for that note), you can also write notes of your own.</p>
<p>When you write a note, the note gets a score based on the reviews that it receives from other Community Notes members. These reviews can be thought of as being votes along a 3-point scale of <code>HELPFUL</code>, <code>SOMEWHAT_HELPFUL</code> and <code>NOT_HELPFUL</code>, but a review can also contain some other tags that have roles in the algorithm. Based on these reviews, a note gets a score. If the note's score is above 0.40, the note is shown; otherwise, the note is not shown.</p>
<p>The way that the score is calculated is what makes the algorithm unique. Unlike simpler algorithms, which aim to simply calculate some kind of sum or average over users' ratings and use that as the final result, <strong>the Community Notes rating algorithm explicitly attempts to prioritize notes that receive positive ratings from people across a diverse range of perspectives</strong>. That is, if people who usually disagree on how they rate notes end up agreeing on a particular note, that note is scored especially highly.</p>
<p>Let us get into the deep math of how this works. We have a set of users and a set of notes; we can create a matrix <span>\(M\)</span>, where the cell <span>\(M_{i,j}\)</span> represents how the i'th user rated the j'th note.</p>
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/matrix.png"></p>
</center>

<p>For any given note, most users have not rated that note, so most entries in the matrix will be zero, but that's fine. The goal of the algorithm is to create a four-column model of users and notes, assigning each user two stats that we can call "friendliness" and "polarity", and each note two stats that we can call "helpfulness" and "polarity". The model is trying to predict the matrix as a function of these values, using the following formula:</p>
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/formula.png"></p>
</center>

<p>Note that here I am introducing both the terminology used in the <a href="https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes/blob/main/birdwatch_paper_2022_10_27.pdf">Birdwatch paper</a>, and my own terms to provide a less mathematical intuition for what the variables mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>μ is a "<strong>general public mood</strong>" parameter that accounts for how high the ratings are that users give in general</li>
<li><span>\(i_u\)</span> is a user's "<strong>friendliness</strong>": how likely that particular user is to give high ratings</li>
<li><span>\(i_n\)</span> is a note's "<strong>helpfulness</strong>": how likely that particular note is to get rated highly. <strong>Ultimately, this is the variable we care about</strong>.</li>
<li><span>\(f_u\)</span> or <span>\(f_n\)</span> is user or note's "<strong>polarity</strong>": its position among the dominant axis of political polarization. In practice, negative polarity roughly means "left-leaning" and positive polarity means "right-leaning", but note that <strong>the axis of polarization is discovered emergently from analyzing users and notes; the concepts of leftism and rightism are in no way hard-coded</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The algorithm uses a pretty basic machine learning model (standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">gradient descent</a>) to find values for these variables that do the best possible job of predicting the matrix values. The helpfulness that a particular note is assigned is the note's final score. If a note's helpfulness is at least +0.4, the note gets shown.</p>
<p><strong>The core clever idea here is that the "polarity" terms absorb the properties of a note that cause it to be liked by some users and not others, and the "helpfulness" term only measures the properties that a note has that cause it to be liked by all</strong>. Thus, selecting for helpfulness identifies notes that get cross-tribal approval, and selects against notes that get cheering from one tribe at the expense of disgust from the other tribe.</p>
<p>I made a simplified implementation of the basic algorithm; you can find it <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/community_notes_analysis/basic_algo.py">here</a>, and are welcome to play around with it.</p>
<p>Now, the above is only a description of the central core of the algorithm. In reality, there are a <em>lot</em> of extra mechanisms bolted on top. Fortunately, they are described in the <a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/ranking-notes">public documentation</a>. These mechanisms include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The algorithm gets run many times, each time adding some randomly generated extreme "pseudo-votes" to the votes. This means that the algorithm's true output for each note is a range of values, and the final result depends on a "lower confidence bound" taken from this range, which is checked against a threshold of 0.32.</li>
<li>If many users (especially users with a similar polarity to the note) rate a note "Not Helpful", and furthermore they specify the same "<a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/ranking-notes">tag</a>" (eg. "Argumentative or biased language", "Sources do not support note") as the reason for their rating, the helpfulness threshold required for the note to be published increases from 0.4 to 0.5 (this looks small but it's very significant in practice)</li>
<li>If a note is accepted, the threshold that its helpfulness must drop below to de-accept it is 0.01 points lower than the threshold that a note's helpfulness needed to reach for the note to be originally accepted</li>
<li>The algorithm gets run <em>even more times</em> with multiple models, and this can sometimes promote notes whose original helpfulness score is somewhere between 0.3 and 0.4</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, you get some pretty complicated python code that amounts to 6282 lines stretching across 22 files. But it is all <a href="https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes">open</a>, you can download the <a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/ranking-notes">note and rating data</a> and run it yourself, and see if the outputs correspond to what is actually on Twitter at any given moment.</p>
<h2 id="so-how-does-this-look-in-practice">So how does this look in practice?</h2>
<p>Probably the single most important idea in this algorithm that distinguishes it from naively taking an average score from people's votes is what I call the "polarity" values. The algorithm documentation calls them <span>\(f_u\)</span> and <span>\(f_n\)</span>, using <span>\(f\)</span> for <em>factor</em> because these are the two terms that get multiplied with each other; the more general language is in part because of a desire to eventually make <span>\(f_u\)</span> and <span>\(f_n\)</span> multi-dimensional.</p>
<p>Polarity is assigned to both users and notes. The link between <em>user</em> IDs and the underlying Twitter accounts is intentionally kept hidden, but notes are public. In practice, the polarities generated by the algorithm, at least for the English-language data set, map very closely to the left vs right political spectrum.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of notes that have gotten polarities around -0.8:</p>

<p>Once again, it is worth reminding ourselves that the "left vs right divide" was <em>not</em> in any way hardcoded into the algorithm; it was discovered emergently by the calculation. This suggests that if you apply this algorithm in other cultural contexts, it could automatically detect what their primary political divides are, and bridge across those too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, notes that get the highest <em>helpfulness</em> look like this. This time, because these notes are actually shown on Twitter, I can just screenshot one directly:</p>
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/helpfulnote1.png"></p>
</center>

<p>And another one:</p>
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/helpfulnote2.png"></p>
</center>

<p>The second one touches on highly partisan political themes more directly, but it's a clear, high-quality and informative note, and so it gets rated highly. So all in all, the algorithm seems to work, and the ability to verify the outputs of the algorithm by running the code seems to work.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-think-of-the-algorithm">What do I think of the algorithm?</h2>
<p>The main thing that struck me when analyzing the algorithm is just how <em>complex</em> it is. There is the "academic paper version", a gradient descent which finds a best fit to a five-term vector and matrix equation, and then the real version, a complicated series of many different executions of the algorithm with lots of arbitrary coefficients along the way.</p>
<p>Even the academic paper version hides complexity under the hood. The equation that it's optimizing is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial">degree</a>-4 equation (as there's a degree-2 <span>\(f_u * f_n\)</span> term in the prediction formula, and compounding that the cost function <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares">measures error squared</a>). While optimizing a degree-2 equation over any number of variables almost always has a unique solution, which you can calculate with fairly basic linear algebra, a degree-4 equation over many variables often has many solutions, and so multiple rounds of a gradient descent algorithm may well arrive at different answers. Tiny changes to the input may well cause the descent to flip from one local minimum to another, significantly changing the output.</p>
<p>The distinction between this, and algorithms that I helped work on such as <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html">quadratic funding</a>, feels to me like a distinction between an <strong>economist's algorithm</strong> and an <strong>engineer's algorithm</strong>. An economist's algorithm, at its best, values being simple, being reasonably easy to analyze, and having clear mathematical properties that show why it's optimal (or least-bad) for the task that it's trying to solve, and ideally proves bounds on how much damage someone can do by trying to exploit it. An engineer's algorithm, on the other hand, is a result of iterative trial and error, seeing what works and what doesn't in the engineer's operational context. Engineer's algorithms <em>are pragmatic and do the job</em>; economist's algorithms <em>don't go totally crazy when confronted with the unexpected</em>.</p>
<p>Or, as was <a href="https://twitter.com/tszzl/status/1473156331297120256">famously said</a> on a related topic by the esteemed internet philosopher roon (aka tszzl):</p>
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/roontweet.png"></p>
</center>

<p>Of course, I would say that the "theorycel aesthetic" side of crypto is necessary precisely to distinguish protocols that are <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html">actually trustless</a> from janky constructions that look fine and seem to work well but under the hood require trusting a few centralized actors - or worse, actually end up being <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/05/25/stable.html">outright scams</a>.</p>
<p>Deep learning works when it works, but it has inevitable vulnerabilities to all kinds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning">adversarial machine learning</a> attacks. Nerd traps and sky-high abstraction ladders, if done well, can be quite robust against them. And so one question I have is: <strong>could we turn Community Notes itself into something that's more like an economist algorithm</strong>?</p>
<p>To give a view of what this would mean in practice, let's explore an algorithm I came up with a few years ago for a similar purpose: <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/pairwise-coordination-subsidies-a-new-quadratic-funding-design/5553">pairwise-bounded quadratic funding</a>.</p>
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/pairwiseqf.png"></p>
</center>

<p>The goal of pairwise-bounded quadratic funding is to plug a hole in "regular" quadratic funding, where if even two participants collude with each other, they can each contribute a very high amount of money to a fake project that sends the money back to them, and get a large subsidy that drains the entire pool. In pairwise quadratic funding, we assign each pair of participants a limited budget <span>\(M\)</span>. The algorithm walks over all possible pairs of participants, and if the algorithm decides to add a subsidy to some project <span>\(P\)</span> because both participant <span>\(A\)</span> and participant <span>\(B\)</span> supported it, that subsidy comes out of the budget assigned to the pair <span>\((A, B)\)</span>. Hence, even if <span>\(k\)</span> participants were to collude, the amount they could steal from the mechanism is at most <span>\(k * (k-1) * M\)</span>.</p>
<p>An algorithm of <em>exactly</em> this form is not very applicable to the Community Notes context, because each user makes very few votes: on average, any two users would have exactly zero votes in common, and so the algorithm would learn nothing about users' polarities by just looking at each pair of users separately. The goal of the machine learning model is precisely to try to "fill in" the matrix from very sparse source data that cannot be analyzed in this way directly. But the challenge of this approach is that it takes extra effort to do it in a way that does not make the result highly volatile in the face of a few bad votes.</p>

<p>One thing that we could do is analyze whether or not the Community Notes algorithm, as is, actually manages to fight polarization <em>at all</em> - that is, whether or not it actually does any better than a naive voting algorithm. Naive voting algorithms already fight polarization to some limited extent: a post with 200 upvotes and 100 downvotes does worse than a post that just gets the 200 upvotes. But does Community Notes do better than <em>that</em>?</p>
<p>Looking at the algorithm abstractly, it's hard to tell. Why wouldn't a high-average-rating but polarizing post get a strong polarity <em>and</em> a high helpfulness? The idea is that polarity is supposed to "absorb" the properties of a note that cause it to get a lot of votes if those votes are conflicting, but does it actually do that?</p>
<p>To check this, I ran <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/community_notes_analysis/basic_algo.py">my own simplified implementation</a> for 100 rounds. The average results were:</p>
<pre><code>Quality averages:
Group 1 (good): 0.30032841807271166
Group 2 (good but extra polarizing): 0.21698871680927437
Group 3 (neutral): 0.09443120045416832
Group 4 (bad): -0.1521160965793673</code></pre>
<p>In this test, "Good" notes received a rating of +2 from users in the same political tribe and +0 from users in the opposite political tribe, and "Good but extra polarizing" notes received a rating of +4 from same-tribe users and -2 from opposite-tribe users. Same average, but different polarity. And it seems to actually be the case that "Good" notes get a higher average helpfulness than "Good but extra polarizing" notes.</p>
<p>One other benefit of having something closer to an "economist's algorithm" would be having a clearer story for how the algorithm is penalizing polarization.</p>
<h2 id="how-useful-is-this-all-in-high-stakes-situations">How useful is this all in high-stakes situations?</h2>
<p>We can see some of how this works out by looking at one specific situation. About a month ago, Ian Bremmer complained that a highly critical Community Note that was added to a tweet by a Chinese government official <a href="https://twitter.com/ianbremmer/status/1676590373727088647">had been removed</a>.</p>
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/chinanote.png"></p>
<p><em>The note, which is now no longer visible. Screenshot by <a href="https://twitter.com/ianbremmer">Ian Bremmer</a>.</em></p>
</center>

<p>This is heavy stuff. It's one thing to do mechanism design in a nice sandbox Ethereum community environment where the largest complaint is $20,000 <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/01/28/round4.html">going to a polarizing Twitter influencer</a>. It's another to do it for political and geopolitical questions that affect many millions of people and where everyone, often quite understandably, is assuming maximum bad faith. But if mechanism designers want to have a significant impact into the world, engaging with these high-stakes environments is ultimately necessary.</p>
<p>In the case of Twitter, there is a clear reason why one might suspect centralized manipulation to be behind the Note's removal: Elon has a lot of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musks-business-ties-china-draw-scrutiny-twitter-purchase-rcna26057">business interests in China</a>, and so there is a possibility that Elon forced the Community Notes team to interfere with the algorithm's outputs and delete this specific one.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the algorithm is open source and verifiable, so we can actually look under the hood! Let's do that. The URL of the original tweet is <a href="https://twitter.com/MFA_China/status/1676157337109946369"><code>https://twitter.com/MFA_China/status/1676157337109946369</code></a>. The number at the end, <code>1676157337109946369</code>, is the tweet ID. We can search for that in the <a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/ranking-notes">downloadable data</a>, and identify the specific row in the spreadsheet that has the above note:</p>
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/commandline1.png"></p>
</center>

<p>Here we get the ID of the note itself, <code>1676391378815709184</code>. We then search for <em>that</em> in the <code>scored_notes.tsv</code> and <code>note_status_history.tsv</code> files generated by running the algorithm. We get:</p>
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/commandline2.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/commandline3.png"></p>
</center>

<p>The second column in the first output is the note's current rating. The second output shows the note's history: its current status is in the seventh column (<code>NEEDS_MORE_RATINGS</code>), and the first status that's not <code>NEEDS_MORE_RATINGS</code> that it received earlier on is in the fifth column (<code>CURRENTLY_RATED_HELPFUL</code>). Hence, we see that <strong>the algorithm itself first showed the note, and then removed it once its rating dropped somewhat - seemingly no centralized intervention involved</strong>.</p>
<p>We can see this another way by looking at the votes themselves. We can scan the <code>ratings-00000.tsv</code> file to isolate all the ratings for this note, and see how many rated <code>HELPFUL</code> vs <code>NOT_HELPFUL</code>:</p>
<center>

<p><img src="https://vitalik.ca/images/communitynotes/commandline4.png"></p>
</center>

<p>But if you sort them by timestamp, and look at the first 50 votes, you see 40 <code>HELPFUL</code> votes and 9 <code>NOT_HELPFUL</code> votes. And so we see the same conclusion: the note's initial audience viewed the note more favorably then the note's later audience, and so its rating started out higher and dropped lower over time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the exact story of <em>how</em> the note changed status is complicated to explain: it's not a simple matter of "before the rating was above 0.40, now it's below 0.40, so it got dropped". Rather, the high volume of <code>NOT_HELPFUL</code> replies triggered one of the <a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/ranking-notes#tag-outlier-filtering">outlier conditions</a>, increasing the helpfulness score that the note needs to stay over the threshold.</p>
<p>This is a good learning opportunity for another lesson: making a credibly neutral algorithm truly <em>credible</em> requires <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/11/25/central_planning.html">keeping it simple</a>. If a note moves from being accepted to not being accepted, there should be a simple and legible story as to why.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, there is a totally different way in which this vote could have been manipulated: brigading</strong>. Someone who sees a note that they disapprove of could call upon a highly engaged community (or worse, a mass of fake accounts) to rate it <code>NOT_HELPFUL</code>, and it may not require that many votes to drop the note from being seen as "helpful" to being seen as "polarized". Properly minimizing the vulnerability of this algorithm to such coordinated attacks will require a lot more analysis and work. One possible improvement would be not allowing any user to vote on any note, but instead using the "For you" algorithmic feed to randomly allocate notes to raters, and only allow raters to rate those notes that they have been allocated to.</p>

<p>The main criticism of Community Notes that I have seen is basically that it does not do enough. <a href="https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/why-twitters-community-notes-feature-mostly-fails-to-combat-misinformation/">Two</a> recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-twitter-birdwatch-community-notes-misinformation-politics/#xj4y7vzkg">articles</a> that I have seen make this point. Quoting one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The program is severely hampered by the fact that for a Community Note to be public, it has to be generally accepted by a consensus of people from all across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>"It has to have ideological consensus," he said. "That means people on the left and people on the right have to agree that that note must be appended to that tweet."</p>
<p>Essentially, it requires a "cross-ideological agreement on truth, and in an increasingly partisan environment, achieving that consensus is almost impossible, he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a difficult issue, but ultimately I come down on the side that it is better to let ten misinformative tweets go free than it is to have one tweet covered by a note that judges it unfairly. We have seen years of fact-checking that <em>is</em> brave, and <em>does</em> come from the perspective of "well, actually we know the truth, and we know that one side lies much more often than the other". And what happened as a result?</p>

<center>

</center>

<p>Honestly, some pretty widespread distrust of fact-checking as a concept. One strategy here is to say: ignore the haters, remember that the fact checking experts really do know the facts better than any voting system, and stay the course. But going all-in on this approach <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/">seems risky</a>. There is value in building cross-tribal institutions that are at least somewhat respected by everyone. As with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone%27s_ratio">William Blackstone's dictum</a> and the courts, it feels to me that maintaining such respect requires a system that commits far more sins of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_of_omission">omission</a> than it does sins of commission. And so it seems valuable to me that there is at least one major organization that is taking this alternate path, and treating its rare cross-tribal respect as a resource to be cherished and built upon.</p>
<p>Another reason why I think it is okay for Community Notes to be conservative is that I do not think it is the goal for every misinformative tweet, or even most misinformative tweets, to receive a corrective note. <strong>Even if less than one percent of misinformative tweets get a note providing context or correcting them, Community Notes is still providing an exceedingly valuable service as an educational tool.</strong> The goal is not to correct everything; rather, the goal is to remind people that multiple perspectives exist, that certain kinds of posts that look convincing and engaging in isolation are actually quite incorrect, and you, yes you, can often go do a basic internet search to verify that it's incorrect.</p>
<p>Community Notes cannot be, and is not meant to be, a miracle cure that solves all problems in public epistemology. Whatever problems it does not solve, there is plenty of room for other mechanisms, whether newfangled gadgets such as <a href="https://manifold.markets/">prediction</a> <a href="https://manifold.markets/">markets</a> or good old-fashioned organizations hiring full-time staff with domain expertise, to try to fill in the gaps.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Community Notes, in addition to being a fascinating social media experiment, is also an instance of a fascinating new and emerging genre of mechanism design: mechanisms that intentionally try to identify polarization, and favor things that bridge across divides rather than perpetuate them.</p>
<p>The two other things in this category that I know about are (i) <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/pairwise-coordination-subsidies-a-new-quadratic-funding-design/5553">pairwise quadratic funding</a>, which is being used in <a href="https://grants.gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin Grants</a> and (ii) <a href="https://pol.is/">Polis</a>, a discussion tool that uses clustering algorithms to help communities identify statements that are commonly well-received across people who normally have different viewpoints. This area of mechanism design is valuable, and I hope that we can see a lot more academic work in this field.</p>
<p>Algorithmic transparency of the type that Community Notes offers is not quite full-on decentralized social media - if you disagree with how Community Notes works, there's no way to go see a view of the same content with a different algorithm. But it's the closest that very-large-scale applications are going to get within the next couple of years, and we can see that it provides a lot of value already, both by preventing centralized manipulation and by ensuring that platforms that do not engage in such manipulation can get proper credit for doing so.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing both Community Notes, and hopefully many more algorithms of a similar spirit, develop and grow over the next decade.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-page-content="true"><p>At Canva, we made the conscious decision to adopt the monorepo pattern
with its benefits and drawbacks. Since the first commit in 2012, the
repository has rapidly grown alongside the product in both size and
traffic. Over the last 10 years, the code base has grown from a few
thousand lines to just under 60 million lines of code in 2022. Every
week, hundreds of engineers work across half a million files generating
close to a million lines of change (including generated files), tens of
thousands of commits, and merging thousands of pull requests.</p>
<figure><span><span></span><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1405" height="623" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/img-0-JW4TIcNVnLmTZPuC.5f5aa060.png"><span></span></span><figcaption>Lines of code over time, from 2012 to 2022</figcaption></figure>
<p>This growth significantly degraded local git performance with commands
like <code>git status</code>taking longer and longer to run. On a new clone of the
Canva monorepo, <code>git status</code> takes 10 seconds on average while
<code>git fetch</code> can take anywhere from 15 seconds to minutes due to the
number of changes merged by engineers. With the importance of git in
engineers' workflow, running these commands multiple times a day reduces
the total productive time engineers have every day and are long enough
that engineers might context switch, further reducing their
productivity.</p>
<h2 id="existing-solutions">Existing solutions</h2>
<p>Luckily, we're not the only ones experiencing this problem when working
with monorepos. Previous work at
<a target="_new" href="https://monorepo-book.github.io/">Github</a>, <a target="_new" href="https://dropbox.tech/application/speeding-up-a-git-monorepo-at-dropbox-with--200-lines-of-code">Dropbox</a>, and recent improvements made
to git provides a lot of resources to improve git's performance. Over
the years, multiple engineers have made several internal blog posts on
how to "make git fast". These culminated in an automated script that
engineers are encouraged to use as part of their onboarding process.</p>
<p>Firstly, to reduce the amount of work git needs to do to find changes,
we used the
<a target="_new" href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-update-index#_file_system_monitor">fsmonitor</a> hook with Watchman so we
capture changes as they happen instead of having to scan all files in
the repository every time a command is run. We also enabled <a target="_new" href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-featuremanyFiles">feature.manyFiles</a>, which under the
hood enables the
<a target="_new" href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-update-index#_untracked_cache">untracked cache</a> to skip directories
and files that haven't been modified.</p>
<p>Git also has a built-in command
(<a target="_new" href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-maintenance">maintenance</a>) to optimize a repository's data,
speeding up commands and reducing disk space. This isn't enabled by
default, so we register it with a schedule for daily and hourly
routines.</p>
<h2 id="whats-unique-about-our-monorepo">What's unique about our monorepo?</h2>
<p>Digging deeper into the type of files inside the monorepo, we found
that <em>.xlf</em> files made up almost 70% of the total number of files.
These <em>.xlf</em> files are <a href="https://www.canva.dev/blog/engineering/how-to-design-in-every-language-at-once/#code-structure">generated</a> and contain translated
strings for each locale. Even though they live in the monorepo, they are
never manually edited by engineers since they're automatically generated
when strings are translated. This meant that locally, git is spending
resources tracking files that engineers would never change. However, we
can't outright delete or ignore these files as they're still needed for
our translation system to run smoothly. The next best solution is to
tell git to not populate them in our working tree using
<a target="_new" href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-sparse-checkout">sparse checkout</a>, effectively ignoring them locally
while still tracking their changes from other sources in the monorepo.
Practically we had to include strings for the en-AU locale for other
parts of the build system to work, but this is a negligible difference.
Though these translations are ignored, our local environments still run
with the special <a href="https://www.canva.dev/blog/engineering/how-to-design-in-every-language-at-once/#pseudo-localization">en-psaccent</a> pseudo-localized locale
by default, so engineers are still conscious of localization
requirements.</p>
<p>We did the following experiments with a separate clone of the monorepo
with default settings for git and no other optimizations mentioned
previously.</p>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="Table showing the git status time for two scenarios" loading="lazy" width="1318" height="326" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/img-1-0Ete6N0oodxvv4NRLjaOQw.c1a1b797.png"><span></span></span></p>
<p>We can take the sparse checkout feature a step further. Our engineers
generally work in small teams and interact with an even smaller subset
of the monorepo. For example, a frontend engineer working on the editor
is unlikely to modify code related to the search or billing server. If
an engineer can tell us what they usually work on, we can craft a
checkout pattern that includes all the required dependencies to run and
test their code locally while keeping the checkout as small as possible.</p>
<p>The Canva monorepo uses
<a target="_new" href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> as our chosen build system where we define
build targets (home page, search server, export button, etc.) and their
dependencies. This meant that given a Bazel target, we can accurately
determine which files are required to build, run and test it and exclude
the rest by querying the Bazel dependency graph. In practice, this
required a bit more heuristics as not everything was hooked into the
Bazel build graph, and symlinks needed to be resolved, but these were
edge cases that could be ironed out. The following table shows a few
example configurations and how they impact the checkout.</p>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1326" height="302" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/img-1-2fQQZA2HPODiAWfsRnLSuA.46a37def.png"><span></span></span></p>
<p>Backend services tend to modularize better and can run mostly
independently while frontend pages less so. This is due to various
reasons like typescript configurations, the way our linting is set up,
and tools and web pages weren't written with sparse checkout in mind,
assuming all files are present at all times. These configurations
provide incremental improvements on top of the translation file that
each engineer can opt into.</p>
<p>Using sparse checkout is not without drawbacks.</p>
<p>Firstly there are now tracked files not physically populated on disk so
they can't be searched through or interacted with. Accidental changes or
an erroneous merge conflict might leave these files in a bad state (for
example, when two pull requests change the same string to be translated
and create a conflict, these files now have to be resolved manually).
These are cases that engineers have to be aware of in their workflow.</p>
<p>There's also an overhead applied to every git checkout command to check
whether the updated file should be populated or ignored. While this
overhead is small with simple patterns like ignoring .xlf files, it
becomes significant with more complex ones.</p>
<h2 id="tying-it-all-together">Tying it all together</h2>
<figure><span><span></span><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="590" height="226" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/img-0-1aUQnKE0YLFMiUR3.b381b8f5.png"><span></span></span><figcaption>The script used to set the recommended git configurations for the Canva monorepo.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Combining existing git configuration best practices for monorepos and
ignoring translation files, we've reduced <code>git status</code> time to 3s and 2s
with cache. While this is a much better experience for engineers
compared to no changes at all, we still have a long way to go to reduce
this number as the monorepo and number of engineers continue to grow.</p>
<h2 id="works-in-progress">Works in progress</h2>
<p>These optimizations set a baseline for what is achievable with
configurations specifically made for large repositories. But to quantify
the impact of git performance on engineers' productivity and further
troubleshoot and optimize it, we need to be able to collect telemetry
from git operations.</p>
<p>Git already outputs traces through the
<a target="_new" href="https://git-scm.com/docs/api-trace2/">trace2</a> formats that we can capture and send to our
central store for analysis. Our team continues to develop an internal
tool called Olly to do just this, capturing operation timing, failures
and their reasons, tracking new branch creations, and more. This helps
us monitor the performance of git across the organization, inform
changes we make to git configurations in the future and is the first
step in quantifying engineers' development cycle.</p>
<figure><span><span></span><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1185" height="485" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/img-0-ye3-FyWoGzP6FNQ3.04692b6d.png"><span></span></span><figcaption>Average duration of common git operations</figcaption></figure>
<p>With this telemetry, we can now concretely quantify the impact git
performance has on engineers, focus on pain points (git fetch from the
above graph), and drill further into each operation.</p>
<figure><span><span></span><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="655" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/img-0-sNAvFMoYvZ_TRbbk.345f65f2.png"><span></span></span><figcaption>A git fetch trace that was captured</figcaption></figure>

<p>Further, with a <a target="_new" href="https://github.blog/2022-04-12-git-security-vulnerability-announced/">recent vulnerability</a> in git, we are
moving towards providing a known version of git to all engineers with
the right configurations by default, ensuring everyone gets the latest
security patches and performance improvements.</p>

<section id="the-fortran-programming-language">

<p>Fortran <br> High-performance parallel programming language</p>

<p>Features</p>
<p>High performance</p>
<p>Fortran has been designed from the ground up for computationally intensive applications in science and engineering. Mature and battle-tested compilers and libraries allow you to write code that runs close to the metal, fast.</p>
<p>Statically and strongly typed</p>
<p>Fortran is statically and strongly typed, which allows the compiler to catch many programming errors early on for you. This also allows the compiler to generate efficient binary code.</p>
<p>Easy to learn and use</p>
<p>Fortran is a relatively small language that is surprisingly easy to learn and use. Expressing most mathematical and arithmetic operations over large arrays is as simple as writing them as equations on a whiteboard.</p>
<p>Versatile</p>
<p>Fortran allows you to write code in a style that best fits your problem: imperative, procedural, array-oriented, object-oriented, or functional.</p>
<p>Natively parallel</p>
<p>Fortran is a natively parallel programming language with intuitive array-like syntax to communicate data between CPUs. You can run almost the same code on a single CPU, on a shared-memory multicore system, or on a distributed-memory HPC or cloud-based system. Coarrays, teams, events, and collective subroutines allow you to express different parallel programming patterns that best fit your problem at hand.</p>
<p>FAQ</p>
<p>What is the status of Fortran?</p>
<p>Fortran is mature and under active development.
The latest revision of the language is
<a href="https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&amp;amp;objId=19441669&amp;amp;objAction=Open">Fortran 2018</a>.
The next revision,
<a href="https://wg5-fortran.org/N2151-N2200/N2194.pdf">Fortran 2023</a>, is planned for
release in 2023.
There are over a dozen open source and proprietary
<a href="https://fortran-lang.org/en/compilers/"><span>Fortran compilers</span></a>.
Further, open source projects like the
<a href="https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib">Standard Library</a>
and the <a href="https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/">Fortran Package Manager</a> are
under active development.</p>
<p>What is Fortran used for?</p>
<p>Fortran is mostly used in domains that adopted computation early–science and engineering. These include numerical weather and ocean prediction, computational fluid dynamics, applied math, statistics, and finance. Fortran is the dominant language of High Performance Computing and is used to <a href="https://top500.org/">benchmark the fastest supercomputers in the world</a>.</p>
<p>Should I use Fortran for my new project?</p>
<p>If you’re writing a program or a library to perform fast arithmetic computation over large numeric arrays, Fortran is the optimal tool for the job.</p>
