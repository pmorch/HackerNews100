        <p>If you own an Intel motherboard with a Z170 or Z270 chipset, you might believe that it only supports CPUs up to Intel’s 7th generation, known as Kaby Lake. Even the CPU socket’s pinout is different in the next generation — we are told, it will fit the same socket, but it won’t boot. So if you want a newer CPU, you’ll have to buy a new motherboard while you’re at it. Or do you?</p>

You can even preserve compatibility with the 6th/7th generation CPUs after doing this mod, should you ever need to go back to an older chip. Contrasting this to AMD’s high degree of CPU support on even old Ryzen motherboards, it’s as if Intel introduced this incompatibility intentionally.</p>
<p><a href="https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/tool-easy-automated-mod-tool-for-coffee-lake-bios/32795" target="_blank">There’s been</a> a <a href="https://community.hwbot.org/topic/175489-asrock-z170-mocf-lives-on-coffee-lake-mods/" target="_blank">number of posts</a> on <a href="https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/guide-fixing-ht-for-coffee-lake-cpus-on-skylake-and-kaby-lake-motherboards-z170-z270/32665" target="_blank">various PC forums</a> and YouTube videos, going through the process and showing off the tools used to modify the BIOS. Some mods are exceptionally easy to apply. For example, if you have the Asus Maximus VIII Ranger motherboard, a single jumper wire between two pads next to the EC <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/adventure-running-8-9th-gen-coffee-lake-cpus-on-z170-motherboard-asus-maximus-viii-ranger.284375/" target="_blank">will enable support without Kapton tape,</a> a mod that likely could be figured out for other similar motherboards as well. There’s a few aspects to keep in mind, like making sure your board’s VRMs are good enough for the new chip, and a little more patching might be needed for hyper-threading, but nothing too involved.</p>
<p>Between money-grab features like this that hamper even the simplest of upgrades and increase e-waste, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/01/05/lets-talk-intel-meltdown-and-spectre/">fun vulnerabilities</a>, and inability to sort out problems like stability power consumption issues, it’s reassuring to see users take back control over their platforms <a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/01/05/enabling-intel-amt-for-bios-over-wifi/">wherever possible</a>, and brings us back to the days of modding Xeon CPUs to fit into 775 sockets.</p>
<p>Don’t get too excited though, as projects like Intel BootGuard are bound to hamper mods like this on <a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/04/12/disabling-intels-backdoors-on-modern-laptops/">newer generations</a> by introducing digital signing for BIOS images, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/12/11/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-intel-management-engine/">flying under the banner of user security</a> yet again. Alas, it appears way more likely that Intel’s financial security is the culprit.</p>

<span>|</span>
<span>Reading time:<em> 10 minutes</em></span>
<span>|</span></p><p>Twenty-five years. A quarter century. That's how long we've been working on Krita. Well, what would become Krita. It started out as KImageShop, but that name was nuked by a now long-dead German lawyer. Then it was renamed to Krayon, and that name was also nuked. Then it was renamed to Krita, and that name stuck.</p><p>I only became part of Krita in 2003, when Krita was still part of KDE's suite of productivity applications, KOffice, later renamed to Calligra... And I became <a href="https://marc.info/?l=kde-kimageshop&amp;m=107877497900328&amp;w=2">maintainer of Krita in 2004</a>, when Patrick Julien handed over the baton. That means that I've been around Krita for about twenty of those twenty-five years, so I'll hope you, dear reader, will forgive me for making this a really personal post; a very large part of my life has been tied up with Krita, and it's going to show.</p><p>But let’s first go back to before when I needed a digital painting application; the first seeds for Krita were laid in 1998, even earlier than the first bits of code. There was this excitement around Linux back then, and there were lots of projects that attempted to create great applications for Linux. One of those projects was GIMP, and another project was Qt. The first was a digital image manipulation application, the other was a toolkit to create user-friendly applications in C++. But GIMP didn't use Qt, it used its home-grown user interface toolkit (although it originally used Motif, which wasn't open source). A Qt fan, Matthias Ettrich, did an experimental port of GIMP to Qt, and gave a presentation about it at the <a href="http://www.linux-kongress.org/1998/abstracts.html">1998 Linux Kongress</a>. That wasn't received well, and resulted in the kind of spat that is typical of the open source community. People were young and tempers were hot.</p><p>Well, in cases like this, the only solution is to go at it yourself, and that's what happened. It took several false starts, but on the last day of May 1999, <a href="https://marc.info/?l=kde-devel&amp;m=92815444812221&amp;w=2">Matthias Elter and Michael Koch started KImageShop</a>: read the mail, because it's quite funny how we did and didn't follow the original vision (KOM was a Corba-like thing, and if you have never heard of Corba, that's probably because Corba was a terrible idea.).</p><figure><img src="https://krita.org/images/posts/2024/kimageshop_project_started.png" alt="|Screenshot of the first mail" title="|Screenshot of the first mail"></figure><p>Development started, and believe it or not, there's still some actual code dating back to then in Krita's codebase, though most of the remaining code is opening and closing brackets.</p><p>And then development stopped, because, well, doing a proper image manipulation application isn't easy or quick work. And then it started again, and stopped again, and started again. There were several maintainers before I was looking for a nice, performant codebase for a painting application in 2003. I didn't know C++; but I had written the first book on using Python and Qt together.</p><p>Krita had been rewritten to the point where it didn't even have a paint tool, so that was the first thing I wanted to have. That was not easy!</p><figure><img src="https://krita.org/images/posts/2024/25_years_screenshot1.png" alt="|Screenshot of the first attempt at a brush engine" title="|Screenshot of the first attempt at a brush engine"></figure><p>But... Being open about it not being easy meant people got interested, and we started gaining contributors. And so, in 2004, we had a small team of enthusiastic people. A lot happened in that year; Camilla Boemann rewrote the core of Krita so we had autosizing layers, Adrian Page wrote an OpenGL based backend, Cyrille Berger added the first inklings of plugins and scripting. Our approach was still pretty technical, though, and we didn't manage to make a release.</p><p>It was only in 2005 that we released Krita as part of KOffice 1.4. Still very immature, but everyone agreed that it was promising, and we got nice reviews in some Linux magazines -- that was still a thing in 2005.</p><figure><img src="https://krita.org/images/posts/2024/Krita_1.4.2.png" alt="|Screenshot of Krita 1.4" title="|Screenshot of Krita 1.4"></figure><p>Then came 2006. And Krita 1.5 was released with support for color managed CMYK. Krita 1.5 also had the short-lived real color mixing watercolor layer feature, but that was too complex to maintain. And in the same year, we released Krita 1.6: Linux Journal called it <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/krita-16-state-art/">State of the Art</a>. We thought it was a pretty mature release, but artists who gave us feedback still found it lacking a lot.</p><p>And then disaster struck. Qt3 reached end-of-life, and Qt4 was released. The porting effort was huge and took ages, also because we, foolishly, decided to rewrite a lot of the 1.x code to make it possible to share components between KOffice applications. The rewrite took all of 2007, 2008 and half of 2009.</p><p>In the meantime, when we were desperately trying to fix all the bugs the porting and rewrite were introducing, we held our first fundraiser: that was to get Wacom tablets for testing Krita with, complete with art pens. I am still using the Wacom Intuos 3 we got way back then!</p><p>In 2009, we then released Krita 2.0. It was not really usable, but it was important for us to have something out that we could get people to test. Krita 2.1 was also released in 2009. We also got our <a href="https://dot.kde.org/2009/12/02/krita-team-seeking-sponsorship-take-krita-next-level">first sponsored developer, Lukáš Tvrdý</a>, whose task specifically was to fix all bugs. Later on, he also improved the performance of Krita's brushes.</p><p>As Krita gained recognition, we got more and more feedback, and in 2010, we decided to have a big sprint in Deventer where we were going to determine what we wanted Krita to be for our users. A Photoshop clone? A GIMP clone? A Corel Painter Clone? Or something that was itself. Who were we making Krita for?</p><p>The answer is true to today: we are making Krita for digital artists who are making art, mostly from scratch. Painting with Krita should be fun for artists of all kinds, all over the world.</p><p>But it would be some time before we'd reach that goal. 2010 saw Krita 2.2 and Krita 2.3: we thought that Krita 2.3 was ready for artists, but it was only with Krita 2.4 and 2.5 in 2012 that Krita really became pretty good! In fact, we had a laser-precise focus: for some years our rallying call was “Make Krita usable for David Revoy!” – partly silly, but also partly serious. We spent time during dev sprints observing artists and allowing them to live comment on what they liked and didn’t like, without the observing developers being allowed to open their mouths, wether in rebuttal or to help the artist out.</p><p>In the meantime, I had created the Krita Foundation so we could do fund-raisers to sponsor full-time developers. The first developer we sponsored was Dmitry Kazakov, who is still the lead developer for Krita.</p><p>Back then, Krita was still part of KDE's office suite, but it was called Calligra now, because of an interminable conflict with just one KOffice developer, the KWord maintainer. All that energy spent on that conflict could have gone into development, it was a huge waste. From the Calligra days onwards, development went much smoother. Nokia was now involved with Calligra's development, and the resulting improvement in the central libraries all applications used also helped improve Krita, though, conversely, the complexity needed to support a very diverse set of applications is still burdening us today.</p><p>Years went by. 2013 was completely uneventful. We made our releases (2.6, 2.7), did our fund-raisers, added features (like animation support), created a version of Krita with a special user interface for touch/tablet users (sponsored by Intel: we still have a great relationship with Intel, our main development fund sponsor). It was great to see the art people were creating, great to get feedback from users and just plain fun to tackle development.</p><figure><img src="https://krita.org/images/posts/2013/kritasketch_2.png" alt="|Screenshot of Krita Sketch" title="|Screenshot of Krita Sketch"></figure><p>In 2014 we ported Krita to Windows, also because of the touch/tablet version of Krita. And we released eleven versions of Krita 2.9, which was really a very fine release.</p><p>Also in 2014, we had our first Kickstarter campaign. Kickstarter was new and fresh back then, and it was really exciting. We got nearly 700 people to sponsor Krita! And we ported Krita to MacOS. For some time we would do a Kickstarter campaign every year, and they were fun both for us and for our developers, we'd set stretch goals and let people vote on what they wanted us to work on.</p><figure><img src="https://krita.org/images/posts/2014/kickstarter.png" alt="|The first kickstarter page" title="|The first kickstarter page"></figure><p>I still had a day job back then, so it was all work done in the evenings and weekends, and on the train during my commute.</p><p>We also started porting Krita, again, this time to Qt5. That wasn't as hard as the port from Qt3 to Qt4, but we lost support for the tablet version of Krita because Qt5 made it impossible to properly integrate our OpenGL based canvas in the touch version of Qt5's libraries. We spent months and quite a bit of money on that, but it was no-go.</p><p>Then I broke my shoulder and lost my day job, with Blue Systems, and suddenly the Krita Foundation needed to pay me, too. Fortunately, we found a sponsor for the port to Qt5, and that was my first sponsored project.</p><p>In 2016, we released Krita 3.0 -- it wasn't as good as Krita 2.9, but thankfully we still remembered the pain we had when doing a rewrite combined with a port, so we simply did the port first, and didn't combine it with a huge rewrite. This had animation!</p><figure><img src="https://krita.org/images/posts/2024/krita_animation2.gif" alt="|The first kickstarter page" title="|The first kickstarter page"></figure><p>We also released our first and last paper artbook. A huge amount of work for me, which already started in 2015 and in the end, a huge money sink, too.</p><figure><img src="https://krita.org/images/posts/2017/artbook-spread.jpg" alt="|The artbook" title="|The artbook"></figure><p>We worked on improved versions of Krita 3.0 all through 2016 and 2017. 2018 rolled by, and we released Krita 4.0, with the results of Kickstarter-sponsored work. Though not all of it, because in 2017, I was preoccupied with the Great Tax Disaster. The Dutch tax office wanted us to pay tens of thousands of euros in VAT for the work Dmitry had done; that's when we hired a proper accountant instead of a small business administration office in a local town.</p><p>When we went <a href="https://krita.org/en/posts/2017/krita-foundation-in-trouble/">public with the problems</a>, donations streamed in and PIA made a huge donation: they basically covered the bill.</p><p>To avoid having this happen again, I brought all commercial activities into a separate one-person company. That became even more important, because in 2017, we put Krita in the Windows Store. That was the second store, after we put Krita on the Steam Store in 2014. Since then, we have released Krita on Epic Store, the Google Play Store and now even on the Apple MacOS Store.</p><p>Time went on, and in 2018, we released Krita 4.1, in 2019 4.2, in 2020 Krita 4.3 and 4.4. Reasonably quiet years of active development, growing user base and popularity. More and more sponsored developers joined in, and Krita made a lot of progress.</p><p>Although the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/KritaOrgPainting">Krita YouTube channel</a> already existed, in 2019, we asked Ramon Miranda to work on regular videos for our channel:</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_9zZNHj5A_Y" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>By now we've built up quite a list of impressive tutorials of all kinds, teaching everything from digital painting itself to creating brush presets!</p><p>And then development slowed down. In 2020, the effects of Covid19 became more and more clear. We couldn't have sprints anymore, so no hyper-productive in-person development sessions anymore. Team members got sick, for some, really sick. Long Covid has crashed my own productivity: there are many days when I can do nothing but lie down in a darkened room.</p><p>By 2021, even though we hadn't had to port Krita to a new version of Krita, we still decided to change vector layers from ODG to SVG, which made Krita files incompatible between versions 4 and 5. A major change in file format, in other words. We're still working on new versions of Krita 5: 5.1 in 2022, 5.2 in 2023.</p><p>The future promises a very nice Krita 5.3!</p><p>And also, groan, a Krita 6.0 because we have started porting Krita to Qt6. And that's no fun, because Qt6 is again a huge change in what Qt offers and allows.</p><p>And that was 25 years of working on something I started dabbling in because I wanted to draw a map for a fantasy novel on my laptop!</p><hr><p>Join the <a href="https://fund.krita.org/">Development Fund</a> with a monthly donation. Or make a one-time donation <a href="https://krita.org/en/support-us/donations/">here</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://krita.org/images/pages/2021-11-16_kiki-piggy-bank_krita5.png" alt="donate to krita" title="donate to krita"></figure></div></div>]]></description>

<p><span>When the town of Seaside, California ordered homeowner Etienne Constable to build a fence to conceal the boat in his driveway, he erected the fence all right. And then he hired his neighbor, artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hanifwondir/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hanif Panni</a>, to paint a mural on the fence—realistically depicting the boat itself. Call it passive-aggressive, call it malicious compliance, but in any event, call it hilarious.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“I’m not a rule-breaker but I like to make a political statement as necessary as well as a humorous statement and a creative statement,” Constable told </span><a href="https://www.ksbw.com/article/man-strikes-back-against-seaside-order-with-boat-mural/60749038"><span>NBC affiliate KSBW of Monterey Bay</span></a><span>. The city had threatened a $100 fine if Constable didn’t comply, but, ironically, he ended up paying for more than that for the artist’s fee alone.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“It was his idea,” Hanif said in a phone interview. “There were </span><i><span>Home Improvement</span></i><span>-kind of moments, where we were chatting and joking about it, a ‘Wouldn’t that be hilarious?’ kind of thing. I think the more he got it ingrained in his head and brought it up a lot, the more I thought, ‘Yeah, that sounds great.’”</span></p>

<p><span>The story has gone wildly viral, reported in news outlets and catching fire on social media.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“To be the number one Google result for ‘boat fence painting,’ that is a trophy that I never knew that I needed,” Hanif said.</span></p>
<p><span>“He’s the quintessentially good neighbor,” he said about Constable. “We’re pals, we talk, we share a backyard fence, so we’ll be working in our respective gardens and chatting. His boat has always been a friend of mine. I’ve never been on it but he invites me. He brings vacuum-sealed fresh salmon for me and the family.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Everybody loves it,” said Constable in a phone interview. “It’s amazing to not have the controversy that can come up from random things on the Internet. I love the fact that people appreciate my zany idea.” </span></p>
<p><span>Why does Constable think it has caught fire the way it has?</span></p>
<p><span>“I think the reason is because it’s absolutely in your face and it’s absolutely not offensive,” he said. “It was done very elegantly, it’s got a statement, it’s artwork so it’s open to interpretation, as is the political statement, and it all comes together in a perfect picture.”</span></p>
<p><span>The mural is painstakingly done; the result looks exactly like Constable’s 19-foot Arima Sea Ranger. Not only that: the shrubs on one side of the driveway as well as Constable’s house on the other side are also faithfully depicted in Hanif’s fence painting.</span></p>
<p><span>“This struck me as the right way to go, and something that makes my house unique,” the homeowner told </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/14/seaside-california-man-paints-boat-mural-driveway-fence/73683545007/"><i><span>USA Today</span></i></a><span>. At least one local official is on Team Constable: “I applaud the constituent’s creative approach, which not only addresses compliance but also showcases a community-driven solution,” city council member Alexis García-Arrazola told the news outlet.</span></p>
<p><span>Hanif studied art and art history at the University of Oregon and is a working multidisciplinary artist in a wide range of formats. He has worked with clients as varied as Lexus and the Pharcyde, as well as for Google (for whom he has done DJ work) and the Wu-Tang Clan (the Staten Island rap titans have displayed his banners onstage at their performances).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The artist is being invited to paint other boat murals for other homeowners, he said. While he’s grateful for the offers of work, he’s a bit hesitant to be typecast. “I do some wild stuff and I’ve been at it for a long time,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span>When asked what kind of wild, he responded: “Demigod head explosion introspective yet cosmic nature mixed with mechanical moving parts, you know? And a lot of multimedia. I pride myself on learning new technologies and approaching them with an analog hand. And yet it’s the boat, the realistic boat on my neighbor’s fence, that’s the one…”</span></p>

Courtesy Hanif Panni, @hanifwondir.</p></div>
<p><span>As makes sense for someone with an art background, Hanif’s work fits nicely into art-historical traditions. One, it is an example of trompe-l’oeil painting (French for “to fool the eye”), a tradition that stretches as far back as classical Greece. The tale goes that one artist, Zeuxis, painted a still life so convincing that birds came to peck at the grapes; his rival, Parrhasius, then invited Zeuxis to his studio to look at a painting hanging behind a curtain, but when Zeuxis went to pull it back, it was revealed to be a trick, and Parrhasius won the contest.</span></p>
<p><span>Hanif’s work also echoes the great tradition of nautical painting, which also stretches back to ancient times and includes works by artists like <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/winslow-homer-crosscurrents-at-the-met-2097285" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Winslow Homer</a>, Fitz Hugh Lane, and J.M.W. Turner. On top of it all, there’s the fact that Etienne Constable shares a surname with English painter <a href="https://news.artnet.com/market/constable-painting-sold-2367375" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Constable</a>. If the latter had painted nautical scenes or trompe-l’oeil works, well, that would have been a hat trick for art history nerds.</span></p>
<p><span>“There are a lot of Easter eggs,” Hanif acknowledged.</span></p>
<p><span>“I appreciate the conversations this thing is spawning,” he said. “It’s the reason I do public art—to get people to have these conversations and have it branch into something that it wasn’t before.”</span></p>

							<p>A time travel paradox in the title is a good place to start a blog post, don’t you think? You don’t yet know the things you need to know so you can’t wish you didn’t need to know them. There is a solution though – Read this blog post.</p>
<p>This all started because Plerion is trying to build a comprehensive risk model for the most severe data breaches occurring in AWS environments. At the top of the list is unauthorised access to S3 buckets. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/decathlon-employee-data-leaked-online-following-breach">Here</a> <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/20/mcgraw_hills_s3_buckets_exposed/">are</a> <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/cloud-misconfig-exposes-3tb-sensitive-airport-data-amazon-s3-bucket">some</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/14/bmw-security-lapse-exposed-sensitive-company-information-researcher-finds/">examples</a> in the media.</p>
<p>As with many things AWS security, the more one digs into the details the more oddities one discovers. None of these oddities are <em>new</em> but they all get regularly rediscovered with great surprise. I thought I’d make a list to maybe lessen the surprise for people in the future, and probably future me as well.</p>

<h2 id="S3-buckets-are-the-S3-API">S3 buckets are the S3 API</h2>
<p>Amazon S3 was one of the first services released by AWS so its incredibly robust and well tested. It also means it has a history predating standardised design patterns, resulting in a quirky API relative to other services.</p>
<p>One of those quirks is that a relatively small part of the API requires HTTP requests to be sent to generic S3 endpoints (such as <code>s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com</code>), while the vast majority of requests must be sent to the URL of a target bucket. Under the hood it might all be the same but at least to the caller, this is how it works.</p>
<p>For example, to list the contents of a bucket, the HTTP request looks something like:</p>						</div>
				<div data-id="02b6c75" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="code-highlight.default">
			<pre data-line="">				<code readonly="true">
					<xmp>GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: [bucketname].s3.amazonaws.com</xmp>
				</code>
			</pre>
		</div>
				<div data-id="4a79a4b" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
				<p>To get the tags associated with a bucket:</p>
				</div>
				<div data-id="ee597cc" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="code-highlight.default">
			<pre data-line="">				<code readonly="true">
					<xmp>GET /?tagging HTTP/1.1
Host: [bucketname].s3.amazonaws.com
...auth headers...</xmp>
				</code>
			</pre>
		</div>
				<div data-id="b080800" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
							<p>S3 isn’t the only service that works this way, Hosted Cognito UI endpoints do something similar (<code>https://[your-user-pool-domain]/login</code>).</p>
<p>The majority of services use a generic endpoint. To get the attributes of an EC2 instance, the API endpoint is something like <code>https://ec2.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/</code>, or to query a DynamoDB table, the API endpoint is <code>https://dynamodb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/</code>. The target resources are typically passed as HTTP headers or parameters rather than through the host.</p>
<p>Because S3 buckets can be both public (accessed without authentication) as well as private (requiring authentication), it’s not always clear which API operations can be used in which way. Sometimes, you have to use the authenticated CLI (or make artisanal custom authenticated requests), and sometimes, you can just make a simple cURL request.</p>
<p>This doesn’t sound sketchy until you start playing stupid games with it. The whole idea broke my personal mental model that all AWS API requests must be authenticated.</p>
<p>This is all a bit abstract, so imagine you were a naughty little admin and put the policy below on a bucket. It’s obviously a bad idea, so don’t actually do it.</p>
						</div>
				<div data-id="ef29521" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="code-highlight.default">

            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::{bucket_name}"
        }
    ]
}</xmp>
				</code>
			</pre>
		</div>
				<div data-id="b68eec3" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
				<p>This policy says everyone can perform all S3 operations against a given bucket. I personally hadn’t internalized what this means in practice. And what it means is that the below request actually does delete a bucket. No authentication is required.</p>

							<p>Can you think of a genuine use case for this?</p>

							<p>If you’re bored one day, make a test bucket and navigate to some of these in your browser:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <p>https://[bucketname].s3.amazonaws.com/?logging</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>https://[bucketname].s3.amazonaws.com/?tagging</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>https://[bucketname].s3.amazonaws.com/?encryption</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The documentation for some operations is still online, but it’s no longer possible to execute them (e.g. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectTorrent.html">GetObjectTorrent</a>).</p>

<h2 id="ListObjects-is-not-the-only-way-to-get-object-keys">ListObjects is not the only way to get object keys</h2>
<p>There are some people in this world who enjoy crimes. Sometimes, those people stumble upon a juicy-looking S3 bucket. They want to download all of its contents but cannot because they need to supply the key of each object, which is like a file path, to download all the objects.</p>
<p>Some crimes are simple. A GET request to the root of a bucket will return a full list of its contents. Therefore, it might appear that denying the <code>s3:ListBucket</code> operation might be a good way to prevent crimes. It works in the sense that a GET request to the root of a bucket will no longer return a full list of its contents.</p>
<p>To make this more real, consider a bucket with a <code>public-read</code> ACL but with a deny <code>s3:ListBucket</code> policy. It’s a bit of an edge case since ACLs are off by default these days, and AWS encourages the use of policies only, but stay with me. In this scenario, there are still at least two ways to get object keys</p>

<ul>
    <li>
<p>GET /?versions – AKA <code>s3:ListBucketVersions</code> – Returns metadata about all versions of the objects in a bucket.</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>GET /?uploads – AKA <code>s3:ListMultipartUploads</code> – This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads in a bucket. An in-progress multipart upload is an object upload that has been initiated by a <code>s3:CreateMultipartUpload</code> request, but has not yet been completed or aborted. In-progress uploads eventually get finished and become regular objects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some documentation around this is a little bit sketchy. For example, the <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/head-bucket.html">HeadBucket reference states</a>:</p>
						</div>
				<div data-id="9089205" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default">
				<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="753" height="290" src="https://blog.plerion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/head-bucket.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.plerion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/head-bucket.png 753w, https://blog.plerion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/head-bucket-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px">													</p>
				</div>
				<div data-id="7336a6e" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
							<p>This is incorrect or at least incomplete. The HeadBucket operation just checks if you have access to perform the ListBucket operation.</p>
<p>It’s clarified a bit later in the document:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>
<p><strong>General purpose bucket permissions</strong> – To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the <code>s3:ListBucket</code> action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html">Managing access permissions to your Amazon S3 resources</a> in the <em>Amazon S3 User Guide</em> .</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The point is, don’t rely on validating only that ListBucket is denied. We made that mistake in the first versions of our product.</p>

<h2 id="Incomplete-multipart-uploads-are-Schrodinger's-objects">Incomplete multipart uploads are Schrodinger’s objects</h2>
<p>Schrodiner’s cat is the one that’s both alive and de-lifed at the same time, right? I’m clearly an expert at physics metaphors, so I’m confident that multipart uploads offer <a title="https://youtube.com/shorts/Sy89JwXZAXk?feature=share" href="https://youtube.com/shorts/Sy89JwXZAXk?feature=share">transparent visibility</a>.</p>
<p>Let me explain. Starting a multipart upload is easy.</p>

							<p>The title of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/discovering-and-deleting-incomplete-multipart-uploads-to-lower-amazon-s3-costs/">this AWS article</a> is a clue as to why that might be annoying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the complete multipart upload request isn’t sent successfully, Amazon S3 will not assemble the parts and will not create any object. The parts remain in your Amazon S3 account until the multipart upload completes or is aborted, and you pay for the parts that are stored in Amazon S3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t figure out a way to download parts of not-yet-completed objects, but it’s certainly possible to delete them. AWS recommends applying a lifecycle rule to delete unfinished uploads after a number of days.</p>

<p>You can skip this section if you are of the view that account IDs, ARNs, and other identifiers are not sensitive. I don’t think they are state secrets, but I know they are very useful to attackers, and therefore, I prefer they aren’t made public.</p>
<p>If you care like me, you’ll be sad to know that listing unfinished multipart uploads via “/?uploads” returns the ARN of the principal who initiated the upload.</p>						</div>

<p>Each object in Amazon S3 has a storage class associated with it. A storage class defines the underlying performance characteristics of object operations. It’s pretty awesome. You can pay Amazon more for frequently accessed objects that need to travel at warp speed, or pay less for infrequently accessed objects that you might only need in the event of disaster recovery.</p>
<p>When reading the above it’s easy to miss that the storage class applies to objects rather than buckets. There’s no way to configure a bucket with the storage class you want. By extension that means the principal doing the uploading gets to choose the storage class of the object being uploaded.</p>

							<p>It’s also possible to set a lifecycle policy that transitions all objects to a given storage class after a period of time.</p>
<p>Some more good news is that a common way to allow uploads from somewhat untrusted sources is to use pre-signed URLs. The AWS Signature Version 4 mechanism requires that all headers starting with <code>X-Amz-</code> be signed. Storage class is specified via the <code>x-amz-storage-class</code> header, and so there’s no immediately obvious way to manipulate it unless an application does something truly horrible.</p>

							<p>In isolation this is not a problem but it can quickly become a problem if an application expects files uploaded to S3 to be case insensitive. Allow me a moment to present a contrived example.</p>
<p>Imagine an application where user passwords are stored in files in S3. Each user has their own file named after their username. The sign up process just checks the existence of the file in the s3 bucket. If the file exists the new user can’t sign up with the supplied username. Given that S3 keys are not case sensitive, if “jeff” already has an account, someone can still register “JEFF”.</p>
<p>The real problem is in the password update function of the pretend application. Here, the application converts the user’s username to lower case before writing to their file in the S3 bucket. A bad hacker person can login in as “JEFF” because that’s what they signed up as, update their password (that’s not really theirs), and login in as “jeff” because they just set the other Jeff’s password.</p>
<p>It’s contrived, but bug bounties pay out many dollars for these kinds of issues every year.</p>
<p>There’s even more to worry about. Although object keys look and feel like filenames, they actually don’t behave like files in many ways. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html">Here’s one</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can use any UTF-8 character in an object key name. However, using certain characters in key names can cause problems with some applications and protocols.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try it out for yourself. You’ll see that spaces, slashes, percentage characters, and many others are valid in object keys. If you try to be clever and use a dot in a key, AWS has this advice:</p>						</div>

							<h2 id="More-ways-to-make-a-bucket-public">More ways to make a bucket public</h2>
<p>Back to the origin story of this post – sometimes a bucket is public even if it isn’t public. Know what I mean? Even if your ACLs are turned off, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketPolicyStatus.html">resource policy is tightly scoped</a>, and block public access is enabled, there are ways to make a bucket publicly accessible.</p>
<p>The most common way is with an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Generally if you’re putting a content delivery network in front of an S3 bucket, you probably intend to deliver the content to the internet. However, if there’s one thing we’ve learned from endless S3 data breaches it’s that intent does not always match reality. This is especially true when most security tools will proclaim with confidence that such a bucket is not public.</p>
<p>If a bucket is exposed via Cloudfront, the resource policy will typically be restricted to just Cloudfront and will therefore be flagged as non public.</p>						</div>

							<p>Another <a href="https://dev.to/aws-builders/your-s3-objects-could-be-public-even-though-the-aws-console-doesnt-say-so-4dcl">fun way</a> to expose a bucket with a restricted resource policy is with Cognito identity pools.</p>
<p>AWS Cognito is a user directory and authentication service. It allows developers to quickly create an authentication experience for an app. Cognito is no different to your favourite AWS services – it is also wildly complicated. However, the thing that matters here is that at the end of a successful login sequence, the user gets temporary AWS credentials for a pre-configured role.</p>
<p>That role has its own permissions and can be used inside resource policies. For example, you could allow the role to <code>s3:ListBucket</code> and <code>s3:GetObject</code> a target bucket. Because the user gets temporary AWS credentials, they can then call those APIs successfully. Again, it doesn’t matter if public access is disabled because the specific identity within the account is allowed.</p>
<p>So how do you successfully login? Since I’m claiming this is public access, there are two Cognito configuration options that matter:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
<p>Self-registration – This is exactly what it sounds like. It allows a user to sign up to an app through a typical registration process. If anyone on the internet can sign up and then sign in, that’s effectively public access.</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>Guest access – This provides a unique identifier and AWS credentials for unauthenticated users. Everything else is the same except the user doesn’t need to complete authentication.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Configuring Cognito is a blog post all of it’s own, but as an example guest access comes down to this series of API calls.</p>						</div>

              for an overview of some hurdles associated with running traditional fiber to the continent.</p>
            <p><strong><em>I am absolutely not in a position of authority to speculate on the future of Antarctic connectivity!</em></strong>
              Seriously. I was a low-level, seasonal IT worker in a large, complex organization.
              Do not email me your
              ideas for improving Internet access in Antarctica – I am not in a position to do anything with them.</p>
            <p>I do agree with the widespread consensus on the matter: There is <strong>tremendous interest</strong> in
              improving connectivity to US research stations in Antarctica. I would timidly conjecture that, at some point,
              there will be engineering solutions to these problems.
              Improved connectivity will eventually arrive in Antarctica,
              either through enhanced satellite technologies or through the arrival of fiber to the continent.</p>
            <p>But – that world will only exist at some point in the future. Currently, Antarctic connectivity is
              <em>extremely limited</em>. What do I mean by that?</p>
            <p>Until very recently, at McMurdo, nearly <strong>a thousand people</strong>, plus numerous scientific
              projects and operational workloads, all relied on a series of links
              that provided max, aggregate speeds of a few dozen megabits
              per second to the <strong>entire station</strong>.
              For comparison, that’s less bandwidth shared by everyone <strong>combined</strong> than what
              everyone <strong>individually</strong> can get on a typical 4g cellular network in an American suburb.</p>
            <p>Things <strong>are</strong> looking up! The NSF recently
              <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=307974&amp;org=OPP">announced</a> some important developments
              regarding Starlink at McMurdo and Palmer.</p>
            <p>I’m aware that the on-the-ground experience in McMurdo and Palmer is better now than it was even just a year ago.</p>
            <p>But – as of October 2023, the situation was still pretty dire at the South Pole.
              As far as I’m aware, similar developments regarding Starlink have <strong>not</strong> yet been announced for South Pole Station.</p>
            <p>As of October 2023, South Pole had the limitations described above,
              <strong>plus</strong> there was only connectivity for a few hours a day, when the satellites rose above the horizon
              and the station was authorized to use them.
              The satellite schedule generally shifts forward (earlier) by about 4 minutes per day, due to
              the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time">difference between Sidereal time and Solar (Civil) time</a>.</p>
            <p>The current satellite schedule can be found online, on the
              <a href="https://www.usap.gov/technology/sctnsouthpolesats.cfm">South Pole Satellite Communications</a> page
              of the public USAP.gov website. Here’s an example of the schedule from October 2023:</p>

            <p>These small intermittent links to the outside world are shared by <strong>everyone at Pole</strong>, for operational,
              science, and community / morale usage.</p>
            <p>Complicating matters further is the unavoidable physics of this connectivity.
              These satellites are in a high orbit, thousands of miles up. This means high latency. If you’ve used
              a consumer satellite product such as HughesNet or ViaSat, you’ll understand.</p>
            <p>From my berthing room at the South Pole, it was about <strong>750 milliseconds</strong>, round trip,
              for a packet to get to and from a terrestrial US destination.
              This is about <strong>ten times</strong> the latency of a round trip
              between the US East and West coasts (up to 75 ms).
              And it’s about <strong>thirty times</strong> the expected
              latency of a healthy connection from your home, on a terrestrial cable or fiber connection,
              to most major content delivery networks (up to 25 ms).</p>
            <p>Seriously, I can’t emphasize how jarring this is. At my apartment back home, on GPON fiber,
              it’s about 3 ms roundtrip to Fastly, Cloudflare, CloudFront, Akamai, and Google.
              At the South Pole, the latency was over <strong>two hundred and fifty times greater</strong>.</p>
            <p>I can’t go into more depth about how USAP does prioritization, shaping,
              etc, because I’m not authorized to share these details. Suffice to say, if you’re an enterprise network
              engineer used to working in a bandwidth-constrained environment, you’ll feel right at home with the
              equipment, tools, and techniques used to manage Antarctic connectivity.</p>
            <p>Any individual trying to use the Internet for community use at the South Pole, as of October 2023,
              likely faced:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Round-trip latency averaging around 750 milliseconds, with jitter between
                packets sometimes exceeding several seconds.</li>
              <li>Available speeds, to the end-user device, that range from a couple kbps (yes, you read that right),
                up to 2 mbps on a <strong>really good</strong> day.</li>
              <li>Extreme congestion, queueing, and dropped packets, far in excess of even the worst oversaturated ISP links
                or bufferbloat-infested routers back home.</li>
              <li>Limited availability, frequent dropouts, and occasional service preemptions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These constraints <em>drastically</em> impact the modern web experience! Some of it is unavoidable. The link characteristics
              described above are truly bleak. But – a lot of the end-user
              impact is caused by web and app engineering which fails to take slow/intermittent links
              into consideration.</p>
            <p>If you’re an app developer reading this, can you tell me, off the top of your head, how your app behaves
              on a link with 40 kbps available bandwidth, 1,000 ms latency, occasional jitter of up to 2,000 ms,
              packet loss of 10%, and a complete 15-second connectivity dropout every few minutes?</p>
            <p>It’s probably not great! And yet – these are real-world performance parameters that I encountered,
              under certain conditions, at the South Pole.
              It’s normally better than this, but this does occur, and it occurs often enough
              that it’s worth taking seriously.</p>
            <p>This is what happens when you have a tiny pipe to share among high-priority
              operational needs, plus dozens of community users. Operational needs are aggressively prioritized,
              and the community soaks up whatever is left.</p>
            <p>I’m not expecting miracles here! Obviously no amount of client engineering can make, say, real-time video
              conferencing work under these conditions. But – getting a few bytes of text in and out <strong>should</strong> still be possible!
              I know it is possible, because some apps are still able to do it. Others are not.</p>
            <h2 id="detailed-real-world-example">Detailed, Real-world Example</h2>
            <p>One day at the South Pole, I was trying to load the website of <strong><em>&lt;$enterprise_collaboration_platform&gt;</em></strong>
              in my browser. It’s <em>huge</em>! It needed to load nearly 20 MB of Javascript, <em>just</em> to render the main screen!
              And of course, the app had been updated since last time I loaded it, so all of my browser’s cached assets were
              stale and had to be re-downloaded.</p>
            <p>Fine! It’s slow, but at least it will work… eventually, right? Browsers do a decent job of handling
              slow Internet. Under the hood, the underlying protocols do a decent job at congestion control.
              I should get a steady trickle of data. This will be
              subject to the negotiated send and receive windows between client and server,
              which are based on the current level of congestion on the link, and which are further influenced by any
              shaping done by middleware along the way.</p>
            <p>It’s a complex webapp, so the app developer would also need to implement some
              of their own retry logic. This allows for recovery in the event that individual assets fail,
              especially for those long, multi-second total connectivity dropouts.
              But eventually, given enough time, the transfers should complete.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this is where things broke down and got really annoying. <em>The developers implemented
                a global failure trigger somewhere in the app.</em>
              If the app didn’t fully load within the parameters specified by the developer
              (time? number of retries? I’m not sure.), then the app
              <strong>stopped, gave up, redirected you to an error page, dropped all the loading progress you’d made, and
                implemented aggressive cache-busting countermeasures for next time you retried.</strong></p>

                <em>The app wasn't loading fast enough, and the developers decided that the app should give up instead
                  of continuing to load slowly.</em>
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot tell you how frustrating this was! Connectivity at the South Pole was never going to meet the
              performance expectations set by engineers using a robust terrestrial Internet connection.
              It’s not a good idea to hardcode a single, static, global expectation for how long
              20 MB of Javascript should take to download.
              Why not let me load it at my own pace? I’ll get there
              when I get there. <em>As long as data is still moving, however slow, just let it run.</em></p>
            <p>But – the developers decided that if the app didn’t load within the parameters they set,
              I couldn’t use it at all.
              And to be clear – this was primarily a <strong>messaging</strong> app. The actual content payload here, when
              the app is running and I’m chatting with my friends, is measured in <em>bytes</em>.</p>
            <p>As it turns out, our Internet performance at the South Pole was  <em>right on the edge</em> of what the app
              developers considered “acceptable”. So, if I kept reloading the page, and if I kept
              letting it re-download the same 20 MB of Javascript, and if I kept putting up with the
              developer’s cache-busting shenanigans, <em>eventually</em> it finished before the artificial failure criteria.</p>
            <p>What this means is that I wasted <em>extra</em> bandwidth doing all these useless reloads, and it took sometimes
              <strong>hours</strong> before I was able to use the app. All of this hassle, even though, if left alone,
              I could complete the necessary data transfer in 15 minutes.
              Several hours (and a shameful amount of retried Javascript) later, I was finally able to send a short,
              text-based message to my friends.</p>

            <p>Does this webapp <strong>really need</strong> to be 20 MB? What all is
              being loaded that could be deferred until it is needed, or included in an “optional” add-on bundle?
              Is there a possibility of a “lite” version, for bandwidth-constrained users?</p>
            <p>In my 14 months in Antarctica, I collected <strong>dozens</strong> of examples of apps like this, with artificial
              constraints built in that rendered them unusable or borderline-unusable.</p>
            <p>For the rest of this post, I’ll outline some of my major frustrations, and what I would have liked
              to see instead that would mitigate the issues.</p>
            <p>I understand that not every app is in a position to implement all of these! If you’re
              a tiny app, just getting off the ground, I don’t expect you to spend all of your development time optimizing
              for weirdos in Antarctica.</p>
            <p>Yes, Antarctica is an edge case! Yes, 750 ms / 10% packet loss / 40 kbps <strong>is</strong> rather extreme.
              But the South Pole was not <strong>uniquely</strong> bad. There are entire commercial marine vessels that rely on older
              <a href="https://www.inmarsat.com/">Inmarsat</a> solutions for a few hundred precious kbps of data while at sea.
              There’s someone at a remote research site deep in the mountains right now, trying to load your app on
              a <a href="https://www.iridium.com/products/thales-missionlink-700/">Thales MissionLink</a> using the Iridium
              Certus network at a few dozen kbps.
              There are folks behind misconfigured routers, folks with flaky
              wifi, folks stuck with fly-by-night WISPs delivering sub-par service. Folks who still use dial-up
              Internet connections over degraded copper phone lines.</p>
            <p>These folks are worthy of your consideration. At the very least, you should make an effort to avoid
              <strong>actively interfering</strong> with their ability to use your products.</p>
            <p>So, without further ado, here are some examples of development patterns that routinely caused me grief at
              the South Pole.</p>
            <h2 id="hardcoded-timeouts-hardcoded-chunk-size">Hardcoded Timeouts, Hardcoded Chunk Size</h2>
            <p>As per the above example, <strong>do not hardcode your assumptions about how long a given payload will take to
                transfer, or how much you can transfer in a single request.</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>If you have the ability to measure whether bytes are flowing, and they are, <strong>leave them alone</strong>, no
                matter how slow. Perhaps show some UI indicating what is happening.</li>
              <li>If you are doing an HTTPS call,
                fall back to a longer timeout if the call fails. Maybe it just needs more time under current network
                conditions.</li>
              <li>If you’re having trouble moving large amounts of data in a single HTTPS call, break it up. Divide the
                content into chunks, transfer small chunks at a time, and <strong>diligently keep track of the progress</strong>, to
                allow resuming and retrying small bits without losing all progress so far. Slow, steady,
                incremental progress is better than a one-shot attempt to transfer a huge amount of data.</li>
              <li>If you can’t get an HTTPS call done successfully, do some troubleshooting. Try DNS, ICMP,
                HTTP (without TLS), HTTPS to a known good status endpoint, etc. This information might be helpful
                for troubleshooting, and it’s better than blindly retrying the same end-to-end HTTPS call.
                This HTTPS call requires a bunch of under-the-hood stuff to be working properly. Clearly it’s not,
                so you should make an effort to figure out why and let your user know.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="example-1---in-app-metadata-download">Example 1 - In-App Metadata Download</h3>
            <p>A popular desktop application tries to download some configuration information from the vendor’s website
              at startup. There is a hardcoded timeout for the HTTPS call. <strong>If it fails, the app will not load.</strong> It’ll
              just keep retrying the same call, with the same parameters, forever. It’ll sit on the loading page,
              without telling you what’s wrong. I’ve confirmed this is what’s happening by reading the logs.</p>

              </a>
            </p>
            <p>Luckily, if you kept trying, the call would eventually make it through under network conditions I
              experienced at the South Pole.</p>
            <p>It’s frustrating
              that just a single hardcoded timeout value, in an otherwise perfectly-functional and enterprise-grade
              application, can render it almost unusable. The developers could have:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Fallen back to increasingly-long timeouts to try and get a successful result.</li>
              <li>Done some connection troubleshooting to infer more about the current network environment, and
                responded accordingly.</li>
              <li>Shown UX explaining what was going on.</li>
              <li>Used a cached or default-value configuration, if it couldn’t get the live one, instead of simply
                refusing to load.</li>
              <li>Provided a mechanism for the user to manually download and install the required data, bypassing the
                app’s built-in (and naive) download logic.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="example-2---chat-apps">Example 2 - Chat Apps</h3>
            <p>A popular chat app (“app #1”) maintains a websocket for sending and receiving data.
              The initialization process for that websocket uses a <strong>hardcoded 10-second timeout</strong>.
              Upon cold boot, when network conditions are especially congested, that websocket setup can sometimes take
              more than 10 seconds! We have to do a full TCP handshake, then set up a TLS session, then set up the
              websocket, then do initial signaling over the websocket.
              Remember – under some conditions, each individual roundtrip at the South Pole took multiple seconds!</p>
            <p>If the 10-second timeout elapses, the app simply does not work. It enters a very long backoff state
              before retrying. The UX does not clearly show what is happening.</p>
            <p>
              <a href="https://brr.fyi/media/engineering-for-slow-internet/hardcoded-timeout-01.png">

                <em>Excerpt from debug log for chat app #1, showing the hardcoded 10-second timeout. We did indeed
                  have Internet access at this time -- it was just too congested to complete an entire TCP handshake +
                  TLS negotiation + websocket setup + request within this timeframe.
                  With a few more seconds, it may have finished.</em>
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, a competitor’s chat app (“app #2”) does <em>very well</em> in extremely degraded network
              conditions! It has multiple strategies for sending network requests, for resilience against
              certain types of degradation.
              It aggressively re-uses open connections. It dynamically adjusts timeouts.
              In the event of a failure, it intelligently chooses a retry cadence. And, throughout all of this,
              it has clear UX explaining current network state.</p>
            <p>The end result is that I could often use app #2 in network conditions when I could not use app #1. Both of
              them were just transmitting plain text! Just a few actual bytes of
              content! And even when I could not use app #2, it was at least telling
              me what it was trying to do. App #1 is written naively, with baked-in assumptions
              about connectivity that simply did not hold true at the South Pole.
              App #2 is written well, and it responds gracefully to the conditions it encounters in the wild.</p>
            <h3 id="example-3---incremental-transfer">Example 3 - Incremental Transfer</h3>
            <p>A chance to talk about my own blog publishing toolchain!</p>
            <p>The site you’re reading right now is a static Jekyll blog.
              Assets are stored on S3 and served through CloudFront. I build the static files locally here on my laptop,
              and I upload them directly to S3. Nothing fancy. No servers, no QA environment, no build system,
              no automated hooks, nothing dynamic.</p>
            <p>Given the extreme connectivity constraints at the South Pole,
              I wrote a Python script for publishing to S3 that
              worked well in the challenging environment. It uses the S3 API to upload assets in small chunks.
              It detects and resumes failed uploads without losing progress. It waits until everything is safely uploaded
              before publishing the new version.</p>
            <p>If I can do it, unpaid, working alone, for my silly little hobby blog, in 200 lines of Python…
              surely your team of engineers can do so for your flagship webapp.</p>
            <p>It’s amazing the usability improvements that come along with some proactive engineering. I had friends at Pole
              with blogs on commercial platforms, and who routinely shared large files to social
              media sites. They had
              to carefully time their day to maximize the likelihood of a successful “one-shot” upload, during a
              satellite window, using their platform’s poorly-engineered publishing tools.
              Often it took several retries, and it’s not always clear what was happening at every step of the process
              (Is the content live? Did the upload finish? Is it safe / should I hit “Post” again?).</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, I was able to harvest whatever connectivity I could find.
              I got a few kilobytes uploaded here and there,
              whenever it was convenient. If a particular chunked POST failed, no worries!
              I could retry or resume, with minimal lost progress, at a later time.
              Once it was all done and staged, I could safely publish the new version.</p>

              <li>If your downloader fails, the user can still get the file manually, using a more robust downloader
                of their choice, such as a web browser.</li>
              <li>The user can download the file one time, and share it with multiple devices.</li>
              <li>The user can download the file on a different computer than the one running the application.</li>
              <li>The user has the flexibility to schedule or manage the download based on whatever constraints they face.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why is this all so important when considering users at the South Pole?</strong></p>
            <p>Downloads <strong>are</strong> possible at the South Pole, but they are subject to unique constraints. The biggest
              constraint is the lack of 24x7 Internet. While I was there, I <em>knew</em> we would lose Internet access at a
              certain time!</p>
            <p>It’s a frustrating reality: with most apps that do their own downloads, we were powerless to do
              anything about this known break in connectivity. We just had to sit there and watch it fail, and
              often watch all our progress be lost.</p>
            <p>Let’s say I had a 4-hour window, every day, during which I could do (very slow!!) downloads. If the total
              amount of data I could download in those 4 hours was <strong>less</strong> than the total size of the payload
              I was downloading, then there is <em>no way</em> I could complete the download in one shot!
              I’d <em>have</em> to split it over multiple Internet windows. Often the app wouldn’t let me do so.</p>
            <p>And that’s not even considering the fact that access might be unreliable during that time! What if the
              underlying connection dropped and I had to resume the download? What if my plans changed and I needed
              to pause? I didn’t want to waste whatever precious little progress I’d made so far.</p>
            <p>A lot of modern apps include their own homegrown, artisanal, in-app downloaders for large payloads.
              By “in-app downloader”, I’m referring to the system that obtains the content for automatic updates,
              patches, content database updates, etc. The common theme here is
              that the app transparently downloads content for you, without you being exposed to the underlying
              details such as the URL or raw file. This includes UI patterns such as <em>Check for updates</em>,
              <em>Click here to download new version</em>, etc.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, most of these in-app downloaders are woefully ill-equipped for the task! Many of them lack
              pause/resume functionality, state notifications, retry logic, and progress tracking. Many of them have
              frustrating restrictions, such as time limits for downloading the payload. While most of these issues
              are mere annoyances in the land of fast Internet, at the South Pole, they can make or break
              the app entirely.</p>

            <p>Every app that includes an in-app downloader has to compete with an extraordinarily high bar for usability:
              <strong>web browsers</strong>.</p>
            <p>Think about it! Every modern web browser includes a download manager that contains
              Abort, Pause, and Resume functionality. It allows you to retry failed
              downloads (assuming the content URL doesn’t include an expiring token).
              It clearly shows you current status, download speed, and estimated time remaining. It allows you to choose
              where you save the underlying file, so you can copy it around if needed. And – it doesn’t include arbitrary
              performance cutoffs! If you really want to download a multi-gigabyte file at 60 kbps, go for it!</p>

            <h3 id="example-1---macos-updates">Example 1 - macOS Updates</h3>
            <p>It’s no secret that macOS updates are huge. This is sometimes even annoying back home, and it was
              much worse at the South Pole.</p>
            <p>The patch size for minor OS updates is usually between 0.5 and 1.5 gigabytes. Major OS upgrade patches are
              sometimes 6+ gigabytes. Additional tools, such as Xcode, are often multiple gigabytes.</p>

              </a>
            </p>
            <p>If every single macOS device at the South Pole downloaded these updates, directly from Apple, we would
              have wasted a tremendous amount of bandwidth. And the built-in macOS downloader certainly wanted
              us to do this! Look at this interface – few controls, no way to break out and easily get
              the underlying patch files. If I canceled the download, or if it failed for some reason, it didn’t always
              intelligently resume. Sometimes, I lost all my progress.</p>

                <em>The macOS updater. No pause button! Was I expected to leave my laptop on, connected to the Internet,
                  and untouched, for 15 days??</em>
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>Now – Apple <em>does</em> have a caching server feature built into macOS. In theory, this should alleviate some
              of the burden! We should be able to leverage this feature to ensure each patch is only downloaded to
              the South Pole one time, and then client Macs will hit the cache.</p>
            <p>I experimented with this feature in my spare time, with a handful of my own Apple devices.
              In practice, this feature still
              required each client Macbook to make a successful HTTPS call directly to Apple, to negotiate cache parameters.
              If this call failed, which it often did (<em>because of hardcoded short timeouts!!!</em>), then
              the client Mac just fetched the patch from public Apple servers. No retry, no notification. The client
              Mac just made a unilateral decision to bypass the cache, without any recourse or even a notification for
              the user. In practice, this initial cache negotiation call failed often enough
              at the South Pole that the caching feature wasn’t useful.</p>
            <p>What we <em>could</em> do was to fetch the full installer (12 gigabytes!) from Apple. Links to the full installer
              packages are conveniently aggregated on the
              <a href="https://mrmacintosh.com/macos-ventura-13-full-installer-database-download-directly-from-apple/">Mr. Macintosh</a>
              blog. We could pull the full installer down to the South Pole slowly
              and conscientiously: throttled, at low,
              background priority, using robust, interrupt-tolerant
              tooling, with support for caching and resumption of paused or failed transfers.
              Once we had the file, we could distribute it on station.
              This process could take several days, but it was reliable.</p>

                <em>The macOS full installer, painstakingly and conscientiously downloaded to the South Pole.</em>
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>But <em>even this</em> didn’t solve the problem! If the client Mac is Apple Silicon, it <em>still insisted</em> on
              downloading additional content directly from Apple, <em>even if</em> you ran the update using the full, 12 GB
              installer.
              There is no way to bypass or cache this. If the OS update required certain types of
              firmware updates or Rosetta updates, then <em>every Apple Silicon client Mac</em> would <em>still</em>
              download 1-2 GB of data directly from Apple during the install process.</p>
            <p>Even worse, the download process was sometimes farmed out to a separate component in
              macOS, which didn’t even report progress to the installer! Installing a macOS update at
              the South Pole meant staring at a window that said “installing, 32 minutes remaining”,
              for <em>several hours</em>, while a subcomponent of macOS downloaded a gigabyte of un-cacheable
              data in the background.</p>
            <p>Apple naively assumed that the 1 GB download would be so fast that they didn’t bother
              incorporating download speed feedback into the updater’s time estimate.
              They did not anticipate people installing
              macOS updates from a location where a gigabyte of downloads can take <strong>several hours</strong>, if not <strong>days</strong>.</p>
            <p>You can’t cache it, and you can’t download it directly using a web browser (or other mechanism). You have
              to let Apple’s downloader do it directly. And, of course, there’s no pause button. It is a major
              inconvenience to users, and a major waste of bandwidth, for each individual client Mac to
              download 1-2 GB of data in a single, uninterrupted shot.</p>
            <p><strong>Ways that Apple could make this significantly better for users with slow or otherwise-weird Internet:</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Compute the required patch, and then give us a download link, so we can download it outside of
                Apple’s downloader.</li>
              <li>Improve the built-in update download tool with pause/resume functionality and intelligent state
                management, to ensure progress isn’t lost.</li>
              <li>Fix the full installer, so it includes <em>everything</em>, including all the currently-excluded items
                such as firmware and Rosetta updates for Apple Silicon Macs.
                It would be much more useful if it included everything. I
                could download it once, and then distribute it, without worrying about each Mac <em>still</em> needing to fetch
                additional data from Apple.</li>
              <li>Improve the Apple Caching Server feature, so it’s more reliable in situations where direct Internet
                access is unreliable. Give us more controls so that we can force a Mac to use it, and so that we can force
                the caching server to proactively download an item that we know will be needed in the future.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>As it stands, it was a huge hassle for me to help people with macOS updates at the South Pole.</p>
            <h2 id="example-2---samsung-android-phone-os-updates">Example 2 - Samsung Android Phone OS Updates</h2>

              </a>
            </p>
            <p>First, the basics. There is no speed indicator, no numeric progress indicator (good luck counting pixels on
              the moving bar), no pause button, no cancel button, no indicator of the file size, and no way to get at
              the underlying file to download separately.</p>
            <p>Second – if the download fails, it cannot be resumed. It will restart from the beginning.</p>
            <p>In practice, at the South Pole, the phone could not download an entire OS update on a single satellite
              pass. So – it inevitably failed as soon as connectivity dropped, and I had to restart it from the
              beginning.</p>
            <p>The <strong>only way</strong> I was able to get this done was by <strong>turning off the phone entirely</strong>, right before
              Internet access dropped, and then turning it back on when Internet access resumed at the next satellite pass.
              This tricked the phone into not giving up on the download, because it was totally off during the period
              without Internet. It never had a chance to fail.
              By doing this, I was able to spread out the download across multiple satellite passes, and I could complete
              the download.</p>
            <p>This is an absurd workaround! I should not have had to do this.</p>
            <p>My US carrier (Verizon) does offer a downloadable application for macOS and Windows which should, in theory,
              allow me to flash the OS updates from my computer, instead of relying on the phone to download the patches.
              In practice, the Verizon app is even worse. Buggy, unreliable, and also insists on using its own in-app
              downloader to fetch the update files (sigh…).</p>
            <p>I’m sure there’s a way I could have gotten the images and flashed them manually.
              This is not an invitation for a bunch
              of Android enthusiasts to email me and explain bootloaders and APKs and ROMs and sideloading and whatever else is
              involved here.
              That’s not the point. The point is – the mainstream tools that vendors ship are <em>hopelessly deficient</em>
              for users on slow Internet, and that’s a bummer.</p>

              link. Then, the developers wouldn’t need to reimplement all the nice download features that my
              browser provides. I could just use my browser.</p>

            <p>Let’s count the issues:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>No pause button.</li>
              <li>No numeric progress / speed indicator.</li>

              the South Pole.</p>
            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I hope the examples I’ve shown in this post have been a helpful illustration of how minor oversights
              or under-developed features back home can become <strong>major issues</strong> in a place with slow Internet.</p>
            <p>Again, I’m not asking that every app developer spend a huge amount of time optimizing for edge cases like
              the South Pole.</p>
            <p>And I’m also definitely not asking for people to work miracles. Internet access at the South Pole, as of
              October 2023, was <strong><em>slow</em></strong>. I don’t expect immersive interactive streaming media to work
              under the conditions I described here, but it would be nice if apps were resilient enough to
              get a few bytes of text up or down. Unfortunately, what
              often ended up happening is that apps got stuck in a loop because of an ill-advised hardcoded timeout.</p>
            <p>I hope everyone found this helpful, or at least interesting.</p>
            <p>And thank you again to everyone who followed along with me on my Antarctic journey! I’ve been off-ice for about
              six months now, and going through my old posts here have brought back fond memories.</p>
            <p>I hope the current winter-over
              crew is doing well, and that everyone is enjoying the <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/polar-night">Polar Night</a>. If the egg supply and
              consumption rate is the same as it was during Winter 2023, they should soon be
              finishing up <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/the-last-egg">The Last Egg</a>.</p>
            <p>I won’t promise any more content, but I do have a handful of other half-finished posts sitting in my
              drafts. We’ll see!</p>

</figure><p>The Japanese government is pushing ahead with a plan to make Japan’s publicly funded research output free to read. This month, the science ministry will assign funding to universities to build the infrastructure needed to make research papers free to read on a national scale. The move follows the ministry’s announcement in February that researchers who receive government funding will be required to make their papers freely available to read on the institutional repositories from January 2025.</p><p>The Japanese plan “is expected to enhance the long-term traceability of research information, facilitate secondary research and promote collaboration”, says Kazuki Ide, a health-sciences and public-policy scholar at Osaka University in Suita, Japan, who has <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01340-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01340-w" data-track-category="body text link">written about open access in Japan</a>.</p><p>The nation is one of the first Asian countries to make notable advances towards making more research open access (OA) and among first countries in the world to forge a nationwide plan for OA.</p><p>The plan follows in the footsteps of the influential Plan S, introduced six years ago by a group of research funders in the United States and Europe known as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00883-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00883-6" data-track-category="body text link">cOAlition S</a>, to accelerate the move to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03342-6]" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03342-6]" data-track-category="body text link">OA publishing</a>.

Each university will host the research produced by its academics, but the underlying software will be the same.</p><p>In 2022, Japan also launched its <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01359-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01359-x" data-track-category="body text link">own national preprint server, Jxiv</a>, but its use remains limited with only the few hundred preprint articles posted on the platform to date. Ide says that publishing as preprints is not yet habitual among many researchers in Japan, noting that only around one in five respondents to his 2023 survey<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup> on Jxiv were even aware that it existed.</p><h2>Green OA</h2><p>Japan’s move to greater access to its research is focusing on 'green OA' — in which authors make the author-accepted, but unfinalized, versions of papers available in the digital repositories, says Seiichi.</p><p>Seiichi says that gold OA — in which the final copyedited and polished version of a paper is made freely available on the journal site — is not feasible on a wide scale. That’s because the cost to make every paper free to read would be too high for universities. Publishers levy an article-processing charge (APC) if the paper is made free to read, rather than being paywalled, a fee that covers a publisher's costs.</p><p>APCs are increasing at an average rate of 4.3% per year, notes Johan Rooryck, a scholar of French linguistics at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and executive director of cOAlition S.</p><p>Rooryck says that Japan’s green OA strategy should be applauded. “It's definitely something that one should do,” he says. “Especially for all the content that is still behind the paywall.”</p><p>Kathleen Shearer, executive director of the Confederation of Open Access Repositories in Montreal, Canada, says that the Japanese plan is “equitable”.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter where you publish, whether you have APCs or not, you are still able to comply with an open-access policy,” she says.</p><p>She adds that the policy will mean that Japan has a unified record of all research produced by its academics because all institutional repositories are hosted on the same national server. “Japan is way ahead of the rest of us,” Shearer says. “More countries are moving in this direction but Japan really was one of the first.”</p><p>Focusing on institutional repositories will have another benefit: it will not discriminate against research published in Japanese, Shearer says. “A big part of their scholarly ecosystem is represented in Japanese.”</p><article data-label="Related">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="1-bit LLMs Could Solve AI’s Energy Demands"><p>Large language models, the AI systems that power chatbots like <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>, are getting better and better—but they’re also getting bigger and bigger, demanding more energy and computational power. For LLMs that are cheap, fast, and environmentally friendly, they’ll need to shrink, ideally small enough to run directly on devices like cellphones. Researchers are finding ways to do just that by drastically rounding off the many high-precision numbers that store their memories to equal just 1 or -1.</p><p>LLMs, like all neural networks, are trained by altering the strengths of connections between their artificial neurons. These strengths are stored as mathematical parameters. Researchers have long compressed networks by reducing the precision of these parameters—a process called quantization—so that instead of taking up 16 bits each, they might take up 8 or 4. Now researchers are pushing the envelope to a single bit.</p><h2>How to Make a 1-bit LLM</h2><p>There are two general approaches. One approach, called post-training quantization (PTQ) is to quantize the parameters of a full-precision network. The other approach, quantization-aware training (QAT), is to train a network from scratch to have low-precision parameters. So far, PTQ has been more popular with researchers.</p><p>In February, a team including Haotong Qin at ETH Zurich, Xianglong Liu at Beihang University, and Wei Huang at the University of Hong Kong introduced a PTQ method called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04291" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BiLLM</a>. It approximates most parameters in a network using 1 bit, but represents a few salient weights—those most influential to performance—using 2 bits. In one test, the team binarized a version of Meta’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/llama-2-llm" target="_self">LLaMa</a> LLM that has 13 billion parameters.</p><p>“One-bit LLMs open new doors for designing custom hardware and systems specifically optimized for 1-bit LLMs.” <strong>—Furu Wei, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a> Research Asia</strong></p><p>To score performance, the researchers used a metric called<strong></strong>perplexity, which is basically a measure of how surprised the trained model was by each ensuing piece of text. For one dataset, the original model had a perplexity of around 5, and the BiLLM version scored around 15, much better than the closest binarization competitor, which scored around 37 (for perplexity, lower numbers are better). That said, the BiLLM model required about a tenth of the memory capacity as the original.</p><p>PTQ has several advantages over QAT, says Wanxiang Che, a computer scientist at Harbin Institute of Technology, in China. It doesn’t require collecting training data, it doesn’t require training a model from scratch, and the training process is more stable. QAT, on the other hand, has the potential to make models more accurate, since quantization is built into the model from the beginning.</p><h2>1-bit LLMs Find Success Against Their Larger Cousins</h2><p>Last year, a team led by Furu Wei and Shuming Ma, at Microsoft Research Asia, in Beijing, created <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11453" target="_blank">BitNet</a>, the first 1-bit QAT method for LLMs. After fiddling with the rate at which the network adjusts its parameters, in order to stabilize training, they created LLMs that performed better than those created using PTQ methods. They were still not as good as full-precision networks, but roughly 10 times as energy efficient.</p><p>In February, Wei’s team announced <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BitNet 1.58b</a>, in which parameters can equal -1, 0, or 1, which means they take up roughly 1.58 bits of memory per parameter. A BitNet model with 3 billion parameters performed just as well on various language tasks as a full-precision LLaMA model with the same number of parameters and amount of training—Wei called this an “aha moment”—but it was 2.71 times as fast, used 72 percent less GPU memory, and used 94 percent less GPU energy. Further, the researchers found that as they trained larger models, efficiency advantages improved.</p><p>A BitNet model with 3 billion parameters performed just as well on various language tasks as a full-precision LLaMA model.</p><p>This year, a team led by Che, of Harbin Institute of Technology, released a preprint on another LLM binarization method, called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11295" target="_blank">OneBit</a>. OneBit combines elements of both PTQ and QAT. It uses a full-precision pretrained LLM to generate data for training a quantized version. The team’s 13-billion-parameter model achieved a perplexity score of around 9 on one dataset, versus 5 for a LLaMA model with 13 billion parameters. Meanwhile, OneBit occupied only 10 percent as much memory. On customized chips, it could presumably run much faster.</p><p>Wei, of Microsoft, says quantized models have multiple advantages. They can fit on smaller chips, they require less data transfer between memory and processors, and they allow for faster processing. Current hardware can’t take full advantage of these models, though. LLMs often run on GPUs like those made by Nvidia, which represent weights using higher precision and spend most of their energy multiplying them. New hardware could natively represent each parameter as a -1 or 1 (or 0), and then simply add and subtract values and avoid multiplication. “One-bit LLMs open new doors for designing custom hardware and systems specifically optimized for 1-bit LLMs,” Wei says.</p><p>“They should grow up together,” Huang, of the University of Hong Kong, says of 1-bit models and processors. “But it’s a long way to develop new hardware.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>For years, online lurkers on forums like Redditors have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ActionFigures/comments/14i8z6r/comment/jquppm6/">wondered</a> if a mysterious third-party seller on eBay and Poshmark was simply Target in disguise. It turns out they were sort of correct.</p><p>An eBay account called Bullseye Deals has been live since 2013, boasting 137,000 followers and over 2.6 million items sold. All of its products seem to be from Target. An identical account on Poshmark was launched in 2022 and has already amassed over 20,000 followers. Bullseye Deals’ branding, while not a perfect replica of the big-box retailer’s logo, is a red dot with the silhouette of a bull inside, which looks an awful lot like Target’s bullseye.</p><div id="piano-cta">


<p>These Bullseye Deals e-commerce accounts offer very little explanation beyond the products themselves. The eBay storefront’s description simply says “Resell – Reuse – Recycle.” But, they feature the wide array of products one might buy in a big-box store, from linens to home goods to children’s toys. Some listings are for items from Target’s private label lines, such as A New Day, Boots &amp; Barkley, and Casaluna.<strong> </strong>These products are usually listed as new, open box or pre-owned — and are priced less than what they were originally sold for at Target. For example, a floor lamp listed as new on Bullseye Deals is selling for $21.99 compared to an $80 price tag on Target.com.  </p>



<p>It’s not unheard of for a retailer to offload excess merchandise, what the industry calls salvage. In fact, it’s commonplace. Stores like TJ Maxx and Burlington source their off-price products by working with retailers and brands. Similarly, reverse logistics businesses exist to help consumer-facing brands deal with excess products that can’t be put back on shelves, like returned or discontinued items. Often, these companies will buy excess inventory in bulk from major retailers and then find ways to resell it themselves, be it selling entire pallets of product or inking deals with clearance retailers like bin stores.</p>



<p>Bullseye Deals technically falls into this latter category, though it is branded in a way that at least hints at it being associated with Target. Sources tell Modern Retail that all the listings are salvage merchandise from Target that’s been purchased by the reverse supply chain services company Liquidity Services, Inc.</p>





<p>A Target spokesperson confirmed to Modern Retail that the company that runs the Bullseye Deals account does buy salvage merchandise from Target and sells it. Liquidity Services, Inc. did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>Unsellable inventory is a big problem for retailers. According to a 2023 <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/press-releases/retail-returns-will-surpass-620-billion-in-2023/">estimate</a> from eMarketer, total retail returns hit $613.94 billion, representing 8.5% of total retail sales.  And that doesn’t represent all the products a retailer <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/retails-inventory-glut-means-big-business-for-liquidators/">might offload</a> because it can’t sell it anymore.</p>



<p> Retailers are often unable to put returned items back on the shelves if, for example, a box gets opened or a product gets lightly used before being returned. Additionally, when factoring in labor and other costs, it might not be worth it for retailers to put some items back on the store floor. For a company like Target — which lets customers return things within 90 days for a full refund — it’s almost certainly swimming in salvage merchandise and is trying to figure out ways to avoid throwing it all out.</p>





<p>Matt Miller, the president and chief operating officer at Mac Wholesale, said there are some examples of retailers including their own branding when selling excess merchandise. Mac Wholesale buys closeout inventory from brands and sells it to other channels like off-price retail. Miller pointed to Best Buy, which has its Outlet program that sells refurbished, clearance and open-box electronics. Similarly, both Macy’s and Nordstrom have off-price outposts like Backstage and Rack.</p>



<p>Miller, however, has never heard of retailers launching e-commerce seller accounts to resell merchandise — nor has he seen reverse logistics businesses build individual online storefronts to mimic the branding of the retailer from which they purchased. </p>



<p>What piqued his interest specifically about this Target example was the fact that Bullseye Deals seems to have all sorts of products, price points and conditions. For example, Miller found a pre-owned Luigi plush toy for around $11. “Most retailers aren’t going through that hassle,” he said. And while it’s true that Target itself isn’t specifically uploading a listing for a stuffed toy, the company it works with is — and is doing it for tens of thousands of products to platforms like eBay.</p>



<p>Target doesn’t control this Bullseye Deals inventory, but it is aware that its reverse logistics partner is doing this. And, according to Miller, it’s a smart way for a retailer to handle merchandise that would otherwise go to the landfill. Especially for a company like Target, which has owned brands that it likely would not like to see show up at other retail stores like TJ Maxx, “it allows them to control the liquidation of their own private-label brands,” Miller said.</p>



<p>Similarly, for other brands that sell at Target, if Target decides to discontinue a product, an e-commerce account like Bullseye Deals is probably more palatable than seeing an item in its clearance section. If a brand is trying to sell to other retailers, “they are going to say ‘what’s wrong if Target is clearance-ing it?'” Miller said.</p>



<p>While Bullseye has been around for years, Miller isn’t surprised that it’s become a popular destination for shoppers nowadays. “Most off-price retailers that would have never considered off-price retail five years ago are considering it now,” he said.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Target — with the help of an intermediary — has been essentially doing this in the shadows. Miller, for one, was shocked he hadn’t seen the Bullseye Deals account until now. “I’m surprised it hasn’t been more visible with that many transactions and that much feedback, he said.</p>

The AOD reduction reaches peak values of around 0.01 in the South China Sea and Eastern North Atlantic off the coasts of Western Europe. In the South Atlantic the regulations create AOD reductions that follow the shape of shipping routes. We then calculate the ratio between the AOD change due to IMO2020 and that between pre-industrial and present day. Over most of the ocean, the ratio is smaller than 10% because of sparse shipping outside the major shipping routes. Over the North Pacific and North Atlantic, on the other hand, it can exceed 10% and reaches 25% in the Norwegian Sea and off the western European and northwestern African coasts. In these regions, the total anthropogenic aerosol concentration is relatively low because of declining emissions of aerosols and their precursors since the 1980s, making ship-emitted aerosols an important component of the anthropogenic maritime aerosols. The IMO2020 is therefore effective in reducing total aerosol loading for these regions. The impact of IMO2020 on the cloud droplet number concentration (N<sub>d</sub>) of low-level maritime clouds as shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01442-3#Fig1">1C</a> (see Methods). Globally, IMO2020 leads to a modest reduction of 0.5 cm<sup>−3</sup> in mean modeled N<sub>d</sub>. Regionally, however, the reduction is more pronounced. The strongest reduction occurs in the North Atlantic, the Caribbeans and the South China Sea, reaching 3 cm<sup>−3</sup>. These are regions with the busiest shipping lanes and thus strongest reduction of ship emissions. The reduction in the South Atlantic shows the most well-defined shipping lane shapes likely due to the unique circulation pattern in this region<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Yuan, T. et al.

For simplicity, we ignore the heat uptake by the deep ocean during the short-term, i.e. O(10) years. 0.2 W m<sup>−2</sup> translates to around 0.16 K of warming with a timescale of 7 years. It is equivelant to 0.24 K/decade, which is more than double the average warming rate since 1880 and 20% higher than the mean warming rate since 1980, linear trend of 0.19 K/decade. We also calculated the lower and upper bounds of the forcing and corresponding expected warming (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01442-3#Fig3">3</a>). The IMO2020 is expected to provide a substantial boost to the warming rate of global mean temperature in the 2020 s.

The 2023 record warmth is within the ranges of our expected trajectory. The magnitude of IMO2020 induced warming means that the observed strong warming in 2023 will be a new norm in the 2020 s. The mean temperature anomaly of the 2020 s will be 0.3 K higher than that of the 2010s. Regionally, the warming effect from IMO2020 on SST is harder to estimate since basin-wide SST changes can be affected by variations in factors like other aerosol concentration, ocean circulation, and air-sea interactions. However, the strong geographical variations in the forcing suggest the impact of IMO2020 on SST may have significant variation among ocean basins. For example, the North Atlantic SST may be disproportionally warmed more by the IMO2020 given the radiative forcing is more than three times the global average, which is likely a contributing factor to the pronounced warming of the North Atlantic SST in recent years<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 28" title="Record-breaking North Atlantic Ocean temperatures contribute to extreme marine heatwaves | Copernicus.

This is evident in the North Atlantic where the IMO2020 produced the strongest forcing.

We use a simple functional form for cloud adjustments that only depends on background N<sub>d</sub> to illustrate the point. The total forcing varies between 0.19Wm<sup>−2</sup> and 0.38Wm<sup>−2</sup>, a 100% relative change. The seasonal variation of incoming solar radiation is the dominant driver for this (SOM). But seasonal variations of background CF, N<sub>d</sub>, and ΔN<sub>d</sub> due to IMO2020 also contribute as they affect the magnitude of the Twomey effect and macrophysical (LWP and CF) cloud adjustments. We estimate the contribution from each variable after removing the seasonal change in solar insolation, and report the results in Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01442-3#Fig4">4B–D</a> (see Methods). ΔN<sub>d</sub> induced by IMO2020 is the strongest contributor. Its variations can affect the forcing by more than 30% in some months such as Jan, Apr, and Dec. Its impact on LWP and CF adjustments contributes equally to the total radiative forcing. The seasonal variation of background N<sub>d</sub> is also an important factor (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01442-3#Fig4">4C</a>).

The comparison does not prove causality but provides a context to assess the impact of IMO2020. The low cloud dimming forcing of 0.2 Wm<sup>−2</sup> from the IMO2020 represents a strong temporary shock to the net planetary heat uptake (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01442-3#Fig5">5A</a>) that has been increasing at a rate of ~0.05 Wm<sup>−2</sup>/yr<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 29" title="Loeb, N.

The net planetary heat uptake has increased by 0.25 Wm<sup>−2</sup> since 2020, making the 0.2 Wm<sup>−2</sup> due to IMO2020 nearly 80% of the total increase. The long-term trend of CERES TOA net radiation is 0.46 Wm<sup>−2</sup>/decade while it changes to 0.67 Wm<sup>−2</sup>/decade since IMO2020 took effect. The difference is 0.21 Wm<sup>−2</sup> that is consistent with our estimated forcing. However, the record since 2020 is too short to ascertain the impact of IMO2020 on the long-term trend of the energy balance given its large interannual variations. The IMO2020 effect also has an asymmetric impact on aerosol loading in the northern and southern hemispheres because of higher baseline ship emissions in the northern hemisphere. This creates interhemispheric contrast in the resulting radiative forcing, which has important implications for deliberate geoengineering schemes because interhemispheric forcing contrast can create significant perturbations in precipitation patterns<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 6" title="Jones, A., Haywood, J. &amp; Boucher, O.

We calculate the interhemispheric contrast in IMO2020 induced warming effect to be around 0.22 Wm<sup>−2</sup>, with the northern hemisphere at 0.32 Wm<sup>−2</sup> and the southern hemisphere at 0.1 Wm<sup>−2</sup>.

Since IMO2020 took effect, the northern hemisphere (NH) absorbed solar radiation has increased by 0.5 Wm<sup>−2</sup> from a plateau between 2017 and 2020 while the southern hemisphere (SH) increased at a much slower rate. The low cloud dimming effect of IMO2020 represents around 60% of increase in NH absorbed solar radiation. The interhemispheric contrast in absorbed solar radiation has increased by ~0.2 Wm<sup>−2</sup> based on measurements, one of the highest rates of increase during the whole record, which is almost the same as that induced by low cloud dimming effect of IMO2020. Another rapid increase period is associated with a phase shift in Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) starting 2014/2015 followed by a strong El-Nino event<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 29" title="Loeb, N.

The forcing magnitude of this inadvertent shock has exceeded this limit by a large margin. However, it does suggest that MCB is a viable solar radiation modification scheme in temporarily slowing the rate of climate warming. Our analysis also points to strong spatiotemporal heterogeneities in the forcing produced by the event. Such heterogeneities need to be considered in any MCB scheme to minimize their potential undesired impacts on regional climate in addition to the desired slowing of climate warming rate. Important part of the heterogeneity exists because of background low cloud distribution and its spatiotemporal variability creating an interhemispheric contrast of radiative forcing having similar magnitude as the global mean radiative forcing. Understanding this contrast is important because to achieve the goal of substantially slowing down the warming rate or limit the maximum warming to be within 1.5<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 30" title="IPCC.

As a result, the interhemispheric contrast needs to be minimized to avoid substantial perturbations to regional monsoons and other precipitation patterns. It should be noted that the forcing due to IMO2020 will take time for it to be directly detectable at the global scale in the observation records, but regionally, e.g., in the North Atlantic, its impact may be detectable sooner.

They do not predict cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and cloud droplet number concentrations (N<sub>d</sub>). We estimate N<sub>d</sub> using a diagnostic deep learning-based approach, involving the usage of two neural network (NN) parameterizations. The first NN (termed MAMnet) is an emulator for the Modal Aerosol Module, which takes bulk aerosol mass for 5 externally-mixed species (sulfates, sea salt, dust, black carbon, and organics) and the atmospheric state (temperature, pressure) as input, and predicts the number concentration and composition for 7 internally-mixed lognormal modes (accumulation, aitken, coarse/fine dust, coarse/fine sea salt, primary carbon matter). MAMnet was trained on 5 years of data from a GEOS simulation implementing the MAM7 aerosol module, and validated against ground observations. The CCN concentration at a given supersatureation can be readily estimated using the 7-modal size distribution and composition<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 45" title="Fountoukis, C. &amp; Nenes, A.

The peak season for the forcing is now wintertime instead of summertime. This serves as our baseline to test sensitivity of forcing to different variables.</p><p>The sensitivity of the forcing to each factor is assessed through the following procedure. We first calculate the seasonal variations of the forcing using observations that contain its seasonal variations. We then calculate a map of annual mean for each variable and use it to calculate the forcing, effectively removing its impact on the seasonal changes. The relative difference between these two calculations can be taken as a measure of how much each variable contributes to the seasonal changes.</p></div></div>

<p><em>Last week we shared a number of <a href="https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/ideas/create-a-web-page-for-a-feature-roadmap/idi-p/5805">updates</a> with our community of users, and now we want to share them here</em>:</p>



<p>At Mozilla, we work hard to make Firefox the best browser for you. That’s why we’re always focused on building a browser that empowers you to choose your own path, that gives you the freedom to explore without worry or compromises. We’re excited to share more about the updates and improvements we have in store for you over the next year.</p>



<h2><strong>Bringing you the features you’ve been asking for</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve been listening to your feedback, and we’re prioritizing the features you want most.</p>



<ul>
<li>Productivity boosters like
<ul>
<li><strong>Tab Grouping, Vertical Tabs, </strong>and our handy <strong>Sidebar</strong> will help you stay organized no matter how many tabs you have open — whether it’s 7 or <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/firefox-power-user-keeps-7400-plus-browser-tabs-open-for-2-years">7,500.</a>&nbsp;</li>



<li>Plus, our new <strong>Profile Management system</strong> will help keep your school, work, and personal browsing separate but easily accessible.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Customizable new tab wallpapers</strong> that will let you choose from a diverse range of photography, colors, and abstract images that suits you most.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Intuitive privacy settings</strong> that deliver all the power of our world-class anti-tracking technologies in a simplified, easy-to-understand way.</li>



<li><strong>More</strong><strong> </strong><strong>streamlined menus</strong> that reduce visual clutter and prioritize top user actions so you can get to the important things quicker.</li>
</ul>



<h2><strong>Continuous work on speed, performance and compatibility</strong></h2>



<p>Speed is everything when you’re online, so we’re continuing to work hard to make Firefox as fast and efficient as possible. You can expect even <strong>faster, smoother browsing on Firefox</strong>,<strong> </strong>thanks to<strong> quicker page loads and startup times</strong> – all while <strong>saving more of your phone’s battery life</strong>. We’ve already improved responsiveness by 20 percent as measured by <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2024/03/improving-performance-in-firefox-and-across-the-web-with-speedometer-3/">Speedometer 3</a>, a collaboration we’ve spearheaded with other leading tech companies. And in that collaborative spirit, we’re also working with the <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2024/02/announcing-interop-2024/">Interop project</a> to make it easy for people to build sites that work great across all browsers. We value your support in our efforts to improve cross-browser compatibility which is why we’ve added new features to easily report when websites aren’t working quite right; this feedback is critical as we look to address even small functionality issues that affect your day-to-day online experience.</p>



<h2><strong>Making the most of your time online — without sacrifice</strong></h2>



<p>Ensuring your privacy is core to everything we do at Firefox. Unlike other companies, who ask you to exchange your data in order to do even basic, everyday things online — you don’t have to give up your personal information to get a faster, more efficient browser experience with Firefox. Reading a news story in a different language or signing a form for school or work shouldn’t require you to give up your privacy. So, we’ve worked hard to make things like translation and PDF editing in Firefox happen locally on your device, so you don’t have to ship off your personal data to a server farm for a company to use it how they see fit — to keep tabs on you, sell your information to the highest bidder, or train their AI. With Firefox, you have a lot of choice — but you don’t have to choose between utility and privacy. Your data is secure, and most importantly, just yours.</p>



<p>We are approaching the use of AI in Firefox — which many, many of you have been asking about — in the same way. We’re focused on giving you AI features that solve tangible problems, respect your privacy, and give you real choice.</p>



<p>We’re looking at how we can use local, on-device AI models — i.e., more private — to enhance your browsing experience further. One feature we’re starting with next quarter is <strong>AI-generated alt-text for images inserted into PDFs</strong>, which makes it more accessible to visually impaired users and people with learning disabilities.</p>



<h2><strong>Join us on this journey</strong></h2>



<p>Our progress is driven by a vibrant community of users and developers like you. We encourage you to contribute to our open-source projects and to engage with us on <a href="https://connect.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Connect</a> or <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/">Discourse</a>, and don’t miss our upcoming AMA on Reddit, which we’ll announce soon. Your participation is crucial in shaping what Firefox becomes next.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NASA has made new data available that can provide air pollution observations at unprecedented resolutions – down to the scale of individual neighborhoods. The near real-time data comes from the agency’s TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution) instrument, which launched last year to improve life on Earth by revolutionizing the way scientists observe air quality from space. This new data is available from the Atmospheric Science Data Center at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia.</p>
<p>“TEMPO is one of NASA’s Earth observing instruments making giant leaps to improve life on our home planet,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “NASA and the Biden-Harris Administration are committed to addressing the climate crisis and making climate data more open and available to all. The air we breathe affects everyone, and this new data is revolutionizing the way we track air quality for the benefit of humanity.”</p>

<p>The TEMPO mission gathers hourly daytime scans of the atmosphere over North America from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Coast, and from Mexico City to central Canada. The instrument detects pollution by observing how sunlight is absorbed and scattered by gases and particles in the troposphere, the lowest layer of Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>“All the pollutants that TEMPO is measuring cause health issues,” said Hazem Mahmoud, science lead at NASA Langley’s Atmospheric Science Data Center. “We have more than 500 early adopters using these datasets right away. We expect to see epidemiologists and health experts using this data in the near future. Researchers studying the respiratory system and the impact of these pollutants on people’s health will find TEMPO’s measurements invaluable.”</p>

<p>An early adopter program has allowed policymakers and other air quality stakeholders to understand the capabilities and benefits of <a href="https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/project/TEMPO" rel="noopener">TEMPO’s measurements</a>. Since October 2023, the TEMPO calibration and validation team has been working to evaluate and improve TEMPO data products.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Data gathered by TEMPO will play an important role in the scientific analysis of pollution,” said Xiong Liu, senior physicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and principal investigator for the mission. “For example, we will be able to conduct studies of rush hour pollution, linkages of diseases and health issues to acute exposure of air pollution, how air pollution disproportionately impacts underserved communities, the potential for improved air quality alerts, the effects of lightning on ozone, and the movement of pollution from forest fires and volcanoes.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Measurements by TEMPO include air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, and ground-level ozone.</p>

<p>“Poor air quality exacerbates pre-existing health issues, which leads to more hospitalizations,” said Jesse Bell, executive director at the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s Water, Climate, and Health Program. Bell is an <a href="https://weather.ndc.nasa.gov/tempo/" data-type="link" data-id="https://weather.ndc.nasa.gov/tempo/" rel="noopener">early adopter</a> of TEMPO’s data.</p>
<p>Bell noted that there is a lack of air quality data in rural areas since monitoring stations are often hundreds of miles apart. There is also an observable disparity in air quality from neighborhood to neighborhood.</p>
<p>“Low-income communities, on average, have poorer air quality than more affluent communities,” said Bell. “For example, we’ve conducted studies and found that in Douglas County, which surrounds Omaha, the eastern side of the county has higher rates of pediatric asthma hospitalizations. When we identify what populations are going to the hospital at a higher rate than others, it’s communities of color and people with indicators of poverty. Data gathered by TEMPO is going to be incredibly important because you can get better spatial and temporal resolution of air quality across places like Douglas County.”</p>
<p>Determining sources of air pollution can be difficult as smoke from wildfires or pollutants from industry and traffic congestion drift on winds. The TEMPO instrument will make it easier to trace the origin of some pollutants.</p>

<p>“The National Park Service is using TEMPO data to gain new insight into emerging air quality issues at parks in southeast New Mexico,” explained National Park Service chemist, Barkley Sive. “Oil and gas emissions from the Permian Basin have affected air quality at Carlsbad Caverns and other parks and their surrounding communities. While pollution control strategies have successfully decreased ozone levels across most of the United States, the data helps us understand degrading air quality in the region.” </p>
<p>The TEMPO instrument was built by BAE Systems, Inc., Space &amp; Mission Systems (formerly Ball Aerospace) and flies aboard the Intelsat 40e satellite built by Maxar Technologies. The TEMPO Ground System, including the Instrument Operations Center and the Science Data Processing Center, are operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Organization, part of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian.</p>

		<p><strong><em>Editor’s Note:</em></strong><em> This post highlights data from Webb science in progress, which has not yet been through the peer-review process.</em></p>
<p>Over the last two years, scientists have used NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (also called Webb or JWST) to explore what astronomers refer to as Cosmic Dawn –&nbsp; the period in the first few hundred million years after the big bang where the first galaxies were born. These galaxies provide vital insight into the ways in which the gas, stars, and black holes were changing when the universe was very young. In October 2023 and January 2024, an international team of astronomers used Webb to observe galaxies as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. Using Webb’s NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph), they obtained a spectrum of a record-breaking galaxy observed only two hundred and ninety million years after the big bang. This corresponds to a redshift of about 14, which is a measure of how much a galaxy’s light is stretched by the expansion of the universe. We invited Stefano Carniani from Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy, and Kevin Hainline from the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona, to tell us more about how this source was found and what its unique properties tell us about galaxy formation.</p>
<p>“The instruments on Webb were designed to find and understand the earliest galaxies, and in the first year of observations as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), we found <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/universe/early-universe-crackled-with-bursts-of-star-formation-webb-shows/" rel="noopener">many hundreds of candidate galaxies</a> from the first 650 million years after the big bang. In early 2023, we discovered a galaxy in our data that had strong evidence of being above a <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-a138baf3-5963-4640-a405-aa3552a5152e" rel="noopener">redshift</a> of 14, which was very exciting, but there were some properties of the source that made us wary. The source was surprisingly bright, which we wouldn’t expect for such a distant galaxy, and it was very close to another galaxy such that the two appeared to be part of one larger object. When we observed the source again in October 2023 as part of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12340" rel="noopener">JADES Origins Field</a>, new imaging data obtained with Webb’s narrower NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) filters pointed even more toward the high-redshift hypothesis. We knew we needed a spectrum, as whatever we would learn would be of immense scientific importance, either as a new milestone in Webb’s investigation of the early universe or as a confounding oddball of a middle-aged galaxy.</p>

The NIRCam data was used to determine which galaxies to study further with spectroscopic observations. One such galaxy, JADES-GS-z14-0 (shown in the pullout), was determined to be at a redshift of 14.32 (+0.08/-0.20), making it the current record-holder for the most distant known galaxy.

<p>“In January 2024, NIRSpec observed this galaxy, JADES-GS-z14-0, for almost ten hours, and when the spectrum was first processed, there was unambiguous evidence that the galaxy was indeed at a redshift of 14.32, shattering the previous most-distant galaxy record (<a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2022/12/09/nasas-webb-reaches-new-milestone-in-quest-for-distant-galaxies/">z = 13.2 of JADES-GS-z13-0</a>). Seeing this spectrum was incredibly exciting for the whole team, given the mystery surrounding the source. This discovery was not just a new distance record for our team; the most important aspect of JADES-GS-z14-0 was that at this distance, we know that this galaxy must be intrinsically <em>very </em>luminous. From the images, the source is found to be over 1,600-light years across, proving that the light we see is coming mostly from young stars and not from emission near a growing supermassive black hole. This much starlight implies that the galaxy is several hundreds of millions of times the mass of the Sun! This raises the question: How can nature make such a bright, massive, and large galaxy in less than 300 million years?</p>
<p>“The data reveal other important aspects of this astonishing galaxy. We see that the color of the galaxy is not as blue as it could be, indicating that some of the light is reddened by dust, even at these very early times. JADES researcher Jake Helton of Steward Observatory and the University of Arizona also identified that JADES-GS-z14-0 was detected at longer wavelengths with Webb’s MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument), a remarkable achievement considering its distance. The MIRI observation covers wavelengths of light that were emitted in the visible-light range, which are redshifted out of reach for Webb’s near-infrared instruments. Jake’s analysis indicates that the brightness of the source implied by the MIRI observation is above what would be extrapolated from the measurements by the other Webb instruments, indicating the presence of strong ionized gas emission in the galaxy in the form of bright emission lines from hydrogen and oxygen. The presence of oxygen so early in the life of this galaxy is a surprise and suggests that multiple generations of very massive stars had already lived their lives before we observed the galaxy.</p>

<p>“All of these observations, together, tell us that JADES-GS-z14-0 is not like the types of galaxies that have been predicted by theoretical models and computer simulations to exist in the very early universe. Given the observed brightness of the source, we can forecast how it might grow over cosmic time, and so far we have not found any suitable analogs from the hundreds of other galaxies we’ve observed at high redshift in our survey. Given the relatively small region of the sky that we searched to find JADES-GS-z14-0, its discovery has profound implications for the predicted number of bright galaxies we see in the early universe, as discussed in another concurrent JADES study (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10033" rel="noopener">Robertson et al., recently accepted</a>).

<p>Whenever <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-larson-a44b543/?ref=review.firstround.com"><strong><u>Will Larson</u></strong></a> meets up with fellow CTOs or heads of engineering at other startups, he often finds himself having the same conversation over and over again — an engineering leader’s version of Groundhog Day. The biggest challenge these leaders are facing is pressure from their CEOs to drive engineering velocity. The message is usually: ship more value, more quickly. “The problem is that no one has a whole lot of conviction that there is a simple way to do this,” says Larson.&nbsp;</p><p>“There's no lever like there is in sales. I think this is not totally true in sales either, by the way, but if you talk to people, there's the theory that in sales, you could just add more people and more sales will happen,” he says. “People look at recruiting the same way. ‘If we do five hires per quarter per recruiter, we just need to add two more recruiters and we’ll be hitting our targets.’”&nbsp;</p><p>However, engineering leaders will be hard-pressed to find a similar lever to pull. “For engineering, there are just no measures that I find super helpful here. There are teams where one individual may be pulling a ton of weight,” he says. “Then there are teams that have one individual who might be getting in the way and creating conflict, and the rest of the team can’t move forward unless they’re removed.”&nbsp;</p><p>But Larson’s keenly aware of how this predicament sounds to non-technical leaders. “Engineering leaders, especially at large companies, are managing a team of a couple hundred people. That team might cost $50 to 100 million in salary a year. So as a CEO, when you hear from your eng leaders that ‘Engineering is an art, and you can’t predict how it’s going to work,’ it’s frustrating. They’re sitting there thinking, ‘They’re telling me this is art, but I’m spending $100 million on this art each year.’ That’s not reassuring.”&nbsp;</p><p>As the CTO at <a href="https://www.carta.com/?ref=review.firstround.com"><strong><u>Carta</u></strong></a>, Larson is no stranger to the intricate challenges like these that engineering leaders wrestle with on a daily basis. His winding career has landed him in leadership roles at <strong>Stripe</strong>, <strong>Uber </strong>and <strong>Calm</strong> (also in the CTO seat) — and he’s scaled engineering teams from tens to hundreds of people.&nbsp;</p><p>As he’s teased out lessons from his own experiences, he’s become a go-to resource for many, penning several highly-circulated essays on his ever-excellent engineering blog, <a href="https://lethain.com/?ref=review.firstround.com"><u>Irrational Exuberance</u></a>, and three books. His latest, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Executives-Primer-Will-Larson-ebook/dp/B0CV4QGPXD/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_w=mgGna&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.cf86ec3a-68a6-43e9-8115-04171136930a&amp;pf_rd_p=cf86ec3a-68a6-43e9-8115-04171136930a&amp;pf_rd_r=131-3454494-9143647&amp;pd_rd_wg=GqqH7&amp;pd_rd_r=8ce3dba2-a0e0-438a-ad35-f210dc21e1a3&amp;ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk&amp;ref=review.firstround.com"><u>An Engineering Executive’s Primer,</u></a> hit the shelves last year. (Larson has also shared his wisdom right here on the Review before, unpacking <a href="https://review.firstround.com/how-to-size-and-assess-teams-from-an-eng-lead-at-stripe-uber-and-digg/"><u>his highly practical framework on the optimal size and state of engineering teams</u></a>.)&nbsp;</p><p>Across his work, Larson has consistently seen that this misalignment between eng leaders and other executives stems from a lack of flexibility. As he sees it, too many well-meaning engineering leaders go by the book of conventional leadership advice.</p><p><strong>"Anytime you apply a rule too universally, it turns into an anti-pattern,”</strong> Larson says. In other words, once a practice is labeled as generally helpful or unhelpful, it blinds leaders to how that practice would work in the context of <em>their </em>organization. The key to effective engineering leadership, Larson argues, lies in figuring out <em>which</em> scenarios are worth deliberately defying conventional logic, and when to simply follow the rules.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>We have to have the openness to think through whether a different approach might make sense in a very specific case. That’s a fundamental part of engineering.</blockquote><p><a href="https://review.firstround.com/podcast/a-masterclass-in-engineering-leadership-from-carta-stripe-uber-and-calm-will-larson-cto-at-carta/"><u>In this exclusive interview,</u></a> Larson lays out <strong>three commonplace engineering leadership practices that he thinks have become anti-patterns.</strong> First, he argues the case against always avoiding micromanagement, providing two concrete tactics leaders can use to get closer to the details. Next up, he explores why measuring an imperfect metric isn’t the worst-case scenario. He wraps with a thought-provoking reflection on why leaders shouldn’t be umbrellas for their teams, and how they can strike the right balance between management by committee and unwieldy bottoms-up decision-making.</p><p>Sprinkled throughout are anecdotes from managing teams at Stripe, Uber, Carta and Calm, full of contrarian thinking meant to push engineering leaders out of their comfort zones. But his advice extends far beyond engineering. Startup leaders in any function will find new tactics and frameworks to apply to their own strategy, and CEOs and founders might just find a new perspective when managing their eng leaders. Let’s begin.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="unexpected-anti-pattern-1-shying-away-from-micromanagement"><strong>UNEXPECTED ANTI-PATTERN #1: SHYING AWAY FROM MICROMANAGEMENT</strong></h2><p>To start, Larson maps out what skills make the top 1% of engineering execs stand out from the top 50%. “The core challenge for engineering execs is they have to wear three different, kind of opposing hats. The best ones can toggle back and forth between them deftly.” He lays out the opposing goals for each “hat:”&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Executive team member. </strong>Finding ways to drive the business forward. “Sometimes that means making decisions that are ‘bad for engineering overall,’ like reducing the engineering budget, for example. Or moving to a business unit model where there is less engineering voice in the room on certain topics,” Larson says.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Engineering manager. </strong>Figuring out the structure of policies needed to run the engineering org, and how to be an effective people leader.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Engineer. </strong>Keeping the bar for technical excellence high. “You’re still responsible for the technical excellence and execution of engineering, despite any outside stressors,” Larson says.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>“I find a lot of executives tend to lean a little bit too heavily on one of these dimensions,” he says. But a common denominator lurks in all three of these roles that keep execs from excelling to the engineering leadership hall of fame. No matter which hat they’re wearing, leaders stumble when they carry over<em> </em>management practices that no longer serve them.&nbsp;</p><p>“Typically when you first start managing, you're coming from a functional expertise role, like a staff engineer or the tech lead for a team. Then all of a sudden you become the manager for that team. So you're in an interesting place where you have the most context technically about everything the team is doing, but you're also now the people manager,” Larson says.</p><p>“Now you have the authority to set work and tell people what to do. At that moment, the advice that people constantly get is to step away from the details. You are told to step away from the code because staying involved will make you a bad manager,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>For some people, he recognizes that this can be helpful advice. Folks who are extremely particular about the way they want things done <a href="https://review.firstround.com/give-away-your-legos-and-other-commandments-for-scaling-startups/"><u><em>should </em>let go of the reins</u></a> and let their teams make decisions on their own. But the vast majority of engineering managers who turn into execs, follow this advice to their detriment. “<strong>One of the biggest lessons in management over the last decade is that micromanagement is bad. But I think this is an anti-pattern</strong>, <strong>because it creates disengaged and context-free leadership</strong>, and leadership can be so much more than that,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>“Too many executives take this kernel of advice and as they grow more senior, start to think of themselves only as resource allocators — that their main job is to allocate budgets to different teams and periodically check in on the quality. While that’s certainly an important part of management, that’s not the entirety of it,” Larson says.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>New engineering managers are often advised to “step away from the code.” But an extremely high-functioning exec understands the domain they are operating in at some level of detail. As you get too far out of the details, you just become a bureaucrat. Too many well-meaning engineering managers end up as bureaucrats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Larson urges engineering execs to forget the term micromanagement altogether and focus instead on cultivating <a href="https://lethain.com/developing-leadership-styles/?ref=review.firstround.com"><u>a different set of leadership styles</u></a> they can pick from. “In cases where there are no clear paths forward or where the folks who have the context around the path forward are violently in disagreement, it pays to get into the details and make the decision yourself,” he says. “That way, you can understand the levers that could really transform the business, the outcomes your team needs to accomplish, the time frame to do it in and how it serves your users better.” &nbsp;</p><p>Developing a stronger conviction around your <a href="https://review.firstround.com/the-6-decision-making-frameworks-that-help-startup-leaders-tackle-tough-calls/"><u>decision-making</u></a> is a career-long practice and one that Larson is still working on himself. “Asking questions like ‘What are we doing? Why are we doing it? What’s the data? Where is the actual source of data?’ monthly or quarterly help me drill further into the details,” he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But if you are looking for more tactical ways to zoom in as a manager or exec, Larson also unpacks two tried-and-tested tactics that will bring engineering leaders closer to the details:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 id="1-get-up-to-speed-by-%E2%80%9Cconflict-mining%E2%80%9D"><strong>1. Get up to speed by “conflict mining”</strong></h3><p>“<strong>The number one way that I see new engineering leaders struggle when they come into a new place is that they assume the context from their previous company applies as is</strong>,” says Larson.&nbsp;</p><p>This tends to happen most <a href="https://review.firstround.com/how-to-scale-yourself-down-not-up-as-a-leader/"><u>when leaders transition from large to small organizations</u></a>, but missing even small contextual details in a new environment has the potential to damage the success of the operation.&nbsp;</p><p>Larson has tripped over this hurdle himself. “One of the challenges we had on Uber’s infrastructure team back in 2014 is that teams were spinning up new services, and a new kind of function code almost every week,” he says. “We were supposed to help them provision these new services. From the very first week, I started to realize my team was further behind every week than when they started. So, my first week there, we were two weeks behind, my tenth week there, we were four weeks behind, and we were just getting worse.”</p><p>As a solution, Larson’s team went down a path of creating self-service provisioning and automation tooling that made it possible for anyone at the company to spin up a new service themselves. “We felt really good about that. We were at the forefront of a movement of many companies doing that,” Larson says.</p><p>“Then I came to Stripe and I saw the same problem. Teams were feeling stuck. I wanted to employ the same solution,” he says. “But I had just started, so I wanted to talk to a bunch of the senior engineers about the idea first and say ‘Hey, here's what we did at Uber. I think we should do it here too.’”&nbsp;</p><p>Larson calls this the <strong>“mining for conflict”</strong> stage of getting up to speed in a new role, and it’s one of his favorite tactics to deploy as a senior engineering leader starting fresh in a new company to get closer to the details, even if it means long conversations with folks with opposing viewpoints.</p><p>“One of Stripe’s most senior engineers absolutely hated my automated tooling idea,” Larson says. “I kept trying to pitch him though. I remember one conversation we had where I asked him, ‘What could I tell you about this idea for you to be comfortable with us trying it out?’ His response was that there was nothing I could tell him. He’d never be on board. At first, I thought, ‘This is a really unreasonable person.’ But later as I dug into it, I discovered he was right. How Stripe did technology was pretty different from Uber. One of the core undocumented strategies at Stripe was they used a Ruby monolith, and so everything was done in the Ruby programming language with a few minor exceptions. The way I wanted to approach this problem wasn't aligned with that.”&nbsp;</p><p>This process of conflict mining served Larson a key lesson. “I could have just ignored him, But then I would have missed the key learning, which is that <em>I</em> was the one who was missing context, and needed to refine my approach.”&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Things are not the same across companies, and you can figure that out pretty quickly by finding something controversial and testing for conflict. The wrong way to solve this is to actually implement the conflict-heavy thing. The right way to do it is just to go have a bunch of conversations.</blockquote><p>Another example happened when Larson was at Calm — which scaled from five engineers to over 100 under his leadership. He ended up making the tough call to cancel a major product migration from the monolith to a multi-product suite.&nbsp;</p><p>“When I got to Carta, I had the instinct to do the exact same thing,” says Larson. “I thought, ‘If it worked at Calm, why wouldn’t it work here?’ But I had to test that idea and get sped up on the context and everyone else's perspectives.”</p><p>It’s key to not confine your conflict mining strategy to your peer group on the leadership team. . “You can usually get buy-in from other executives pretty easily, but it’s much more difficult to get buy-in from people with the most context around a given problem,” he says, “Their opinion is most valuable because they are the ones who live in the details. You can’t lie to them. They know the truth of how things run.”&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Successful leaders come in and ask, ‘How can I change myself to fit?’ not ‘How can I force my entire organization to fit to work with me?’ It's hard to move organizations, and you shouldn't do it if you don’t need to.</blockquote><h3 id="2-write-the-details-down"><strong>2. Write the details down</strong></h3><p>Any executive who has come in fresh to a new company, no matter the size or industry, will probably be familiar with the following scenario: “Every company you come into, you’ll start asking around and the engineers will say, ‘There's no product strategy,’ Then you turn around and go to the product managers and they'll say things like, ‘There's no business strategy.’ Then you go back to the engineers, and they say ‘There’s not even a technology strategy written. What sort of company are we?’” Larson says. “<strong>What ends up happening is that senior leaders coming in will just assume that their last company’s strategy will apply because nothing is written down that would say otherwise</strong>.” (His transition from Uber to Stripe which he details above is a prime example.)&nbsp;</p><blockquote>There’s this pervasive belief that there’s no strategy anywhere, but that’s not true. There is strategy everywhere, it’s just rarely written.&nbsp;</blockquote><figure><img src="https://review.firstround.com/content/images/2024/05/headshot.jpeg" alt="Photo of Will Larson sitting on a blue coach" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1332" srcset="https://review.firstround.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/headshot.jpeg 600w, https://review.firstround.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/headshot.jpeg 1000w, https://review.firstround.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/headshot.jpeg 1600w, https://review.firstround.com/content/images/2024/05/headshot.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Will Larson, CTO at Carta</span></figcaption></figure><p>Complicating things even further, Larson also has found that many companies do have a habit of writing things down, they just aren’t the <em>right </em>things. “It’s the small decisions that end up getting documented,” Larson says. “You’d think it would be the opposite, but in my experience, the answers to important questions like, ‘Why did we go into this business? Why are we shutting down this business line? Why are we doing this services migration that's going to take five years?’ literally aren't written down anywhere.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://review.firstround.com/investing-in-internal-documentation-a-brick-by-brick-guide-for-startups/"><u>Building a culture of documentation is essential</u></a> to unlocking a fast-moving engineering org, and most leaders and companies do seem to have a good grasp on this. However existing leaders are often faced with a ton of inertia. “Where there’s already momentum, it’s particularly hard to course correct on large things,” Larson says. “It takes much more activation energy than continuing down the path they were already on.”&nbsp;</p><p>So for those new leaders coming into a company, they have a unique opportunity to create a lot of<a href="https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-to-make-an-impact-in-your-first?ref=review.firstround.com"><u> impact in their first 90 days</u></a> just by coming in with fresh eyes. Larson stresses that before leaders jump the gun and start to etch their own strategies into stone, it’s important to consider these two pieces of advice:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>1. Get your shovel and go digging.</strong> Understand the <em>why </em>behind every decision made. “Sometimes the underlying context or beliefs about something is no longer true, but people continue going down that path because they haven’t stepped back,” Larson says. “So it’s up to you to do some archeological digging to figure out the rationale.” He suggests having as many conversations with longtime employees as possible. “From that you can figure out if the underlying beliefs are still true,” he says.&nbsp; </li><li><strong>2. Use other companies' success as benchmarks. </strong>“Sometimes the decision-making is good, but three years in, the execution is still not working. The easiest way to get a sense of what is real and what’s not, especially for new leaders coming in, is by looking at examples of progress at other companies. See how long it took Airbnb or Dropbox to accomplish the same task and set it as a benchmark,” says Larson. “It might not be a perfect truth, but it gives you a reasonable guess. If you are taking three times longer than them, and still haven’t gotten any meaningful complexity moved out of your monolith, then it’s fundamentally not working and time to have some challenging conversations.” <strong> </strong><br>who’s</li></ul><p>After thoroughly investigating everything that’s already happened, combined with fresh benchmarks and goals to reach, now it’s time to actually put pen to paper. If you’re a leader who’s staring down a blank strategy doc, Larson recommends starting with Richard Rumelt’s “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/0307886239?ref=review.firstround.com"><u>good strategy, bad strategy” framework</u></a> as an outline. </p><p>“Rumelt believes that each business decision should be explained in a way that answers three questions,” Larson says. He walks through how an imaginary startup would frame its answers when figuring out a cost strategy:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>What’s the diagnosis?&nbsp; </strong>The first thing you should do is codify the reality of the circumstances you are working in. Rumuelt calls this a diagnosis. “For example, a diagnosis could be that it’s 2024 and funding is really hard to get. We have $10 million in the bank and spent about $2.5 million last year. Our revenue is steady, but it's not growing. That’s our diagnosis.” Larson says.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>What are the guiding policies?</strong> Next, intercept your diagnosis and turn it into an approach to deal with the problems at hand with guiding policies. “Strong guiding policies include parameters for both how decisions are going to get made and what the goals of those decisions are,” Larson says.“So in our example, as long as costs are kept flat year over year and the startup maintains its current revenue, we’ll have four years of runway, and we’re comfortable with that. So we plan to spend $2.5 million. We also will aggressively prevent any initiative that's going to cause us to spend more money,” he says. <br></li><li><strong>What’s the coherent action? </strong>“Rumelt's biggest concern about strategy is that it consists of a lot of spoken words that don't actually get implemented or used anywhere. So he has this idea of coherent action, which says a strategy is only real if you are specifically doing something today, based on the guiding policies to make that a real thing. An example could be a monthly meeting with finance to review every expenditure. If you start seeing an increase in the curve, you can immediately spot the fix to get back on track,” he says.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Each point should be detailed enough to give the full picture, but concise enough to get across a clear message. One last point to consider is documenting your beliefs on technology investment and how broad you want your investment to be.&nbsp;</p><p>“Do you want to have one programming language for everything? Or do you want to pick the best programming language for each problem that you work on?” Larson says. “Uber was more in the latter half-camp of supporting many things. Stripe leaned toward having one tool for all problems. When that’s written down and codified somewhere, it can help inform your conviction in making decisions in the future.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote>If you just write things down, no matter how bad they are, your strategy will improve almost overnight. If you don’t write things down, it’s impossible to improve your strategy.&nbsp;</blockquote><h2 id="unexpected-anti-pattern-2-pushing-back-on-measuring-flawed-metrics"><strong>UNEXPECTED ANTI-PATTERN #2: PUSHING BACK ON MEASURING FLAWED METRICS&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>“<a href="https://lethain.com/measuring-engineering-organizations/?ref=review.firstround.com"><u>Measurement</u></a> is ripe with anti-patterns,” says Larson. Like many engineers, earlier in his career, Larson was a self-described “purist” when it came to finding and measuring the right thing to anchor his team’s strategy around. “What I found is that 1) This took forever and 2) You can’t guide people to the perfect thing if they don’t have the context of why the earlier, simpler measures didn’t make sense,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>Only after spending time in several leadership roles did Larson realize that <strong>getting caught up on finding the right measurement <em>was </em>the anti-pattern</strong>. “Often when people start measuring, there's always a concern that their measurement is flawed. And that's true for all functions,” he says. “But I’m a believer in measuring something imperfect, but useful, versus holding out for the perfect metric while measuring nothing in the interim.”&nbsp;</p><blockquote>You can be ideologically pure and say we shouldn't measure something, but all that does is slow down the learning of the organization around you. It doesn't actually help you accomplish your goal.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>He gives a simple example of using story points as a success metric. “Everyone you talk to about story points in a sprint is going to say this is a terrible way to measure velocity, it’s a waste of time,” he says. “And that may be true, but if your CEO disagrees with that, then that’s actually interesting, right? Because it means that they haven't built an intuition about how these things work.”&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, he says engineering leaders are better off helping their CEO build an intuition in this area. “That only happens by actually measuring story points, reporting to them and then getting into the details of why it’s not a useful metric to show velocity,” he says.</p><blockquote>I’m coming to appreciate that the most valuable thing you can do as an engineering exec is to educate other execs on how engineering works, instead of shielding your org from everyone else.</blockquote><p>The ultimate goal when it comes to laying out the measurements in your eng strategy isn’t getting into the weeds of a debate over whether reliability more accurately measures the progress of your team then, say, the volume of pull requests. Instead, Larson says engineering leaders should place a premium on how much their CEO absorbs. “Remember, measurements are going to change every quarter, for the rest of time at your company,” Larson says. “So the real goal when you measure upwards is how much does your CEO understand the real substance of the work your team is getting done?”</p><p>In this section, Larson offers up two ways engineering executives can prioritize context and alignment with their CEO and wider leadership team:&nbsp;</p><h3 id="focus-on-improving-mental-models">Focus on improving mental models&nbsp;</h3><p>Early on at Stripe, Larson’s team implemented a controversial metric to track his team’s success: reliability. It started by tracking uptime for their enterprise customers (“If we dipped below four-nines of API availability, there was a financial consequence to the business,” Larson recalls.)</p><p>His org took the idea one layer deeper and started setting targets for the number of production incidents they had. They assigned different levels of severity to incidents: low, medium and high. Across the eng org, success was tracked by how many high-severity incidents occurred, signaling to higher-ups that their team was focused on reliability. “This sparked an internal debate on if having targets around this was even helpful because people started to hide incidents,” Larson says. “There were debates on whether it would be more useful to have a target around customer impact of incidents. We really started to go all the way down.”&nbsp;</p><p>He remembers that his team and other eng leaders were frustrated by this, but to Larson, that was okay. “Again, it came back to this idea that measurements aren’t perfect. <strong>The goal was to improve the mental model of how our leaders think about these areas.</strong> Was tracking the number of incidents the perfect metric to start out with? No. But was it useful? Absolutely. It was a great platform to refine the company’s mental model on reliability,” he says.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>When you think about how to show off measurements to your CEO or your board, I would encourage engineers to worry less about things that offend their personal mental model, and think more about things that would inform the mental models of their board, their CEO, etc.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>If you are looking for more in-depth technical metrics that will help you gauge success, Larson recommends checking out <a href="https://dora.dev/?ref=review.firstround.com"><u>DORA</u></a>, the more recent <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=review.firstround.com"><u>SPACE</u></a> framework or the business software book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339?ref=review.firstround.com"><em><u>Accelerate</u></em></a>. But there is a caveat.</p><p>“The metrics in these frameworks are great for understanding where problems are, so you know where to invest so you can improve. But they're not going to increase engineering velocity from 100 to 120. They're simply going to say, ‘Deployments going pretty slowly right now, here’s where we can make an investment to improve deployment,’” Larson says.&nbsp;</p><p>“An easier way to think about what to measure is just by looking at when you drop below a target. That usually means that you want to invest a little bit more in improving those areas as well.”&nbsp;</p><blockquote>People want metrics to show reality. They want them to show the truth. But metrics are only partly about showing the truth. The other half is about educating people, to inform their mental model about how the truth works. &nbsp;</blockquote><h3 id="pull-your-ceo-into-the-details"><strong>Pull your CEO into the details&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Larson says that one of the growing trends he sees inside the engineering world that is challenging its leaders is an executive interest in volume.&nbsp;</p><p>“I remember one request from a CEO who wanted to understand the volume of the lines of code being written by the different engineers,” Larson says. “One challenge with that is there’s no direct correlation between the volume of code and the impact on the product. How do you track the value of people who are coaching others or improving the quality of others’ PRs against the folks who are actually contributing a significant amount of code? Sometimes more code is in fact worse,” he says.</p><p>“This is tricky because it's super nuanced. Within each pull request, there are the lines of code, sure, but some of them are bad,” Larson says. “Some of the lines of code are external libraries being added. Some of these are mostly tests, which are very valuable but might be very robust.”&nbsp;</p><p>When Larson is faced with executives or people pushing for specific things, he always takes it back to building their mental model. “I tell them that I’ll get them this data, but we have to talk through it,” he says. “Let's drill into it and understand the cases where this is actually a bad proxy. I think where I’ve gone wrong in the past, and where engineering leaders get into trouble, is by pushing back. They focus on saying ‘This is a terrible way to measure,’ instead of saying, ‘Let’s start here and drill in until we can understand the limitations of measuring this way.”&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Trying to force people out of the details is never a good way to build alignment. You want to pull them into the details, and educate them there.&nbsp;</blockquote><h2 id="unexpected-anti-pattern-3-serving-as-the-umbrella-for-your-team"><strong>UNEXPECTED ANTI-PATTERN #3: SERVING AS THE UMBRELLA FOR YOUR TEAM</strong></h2><p>“There's this graphic that circulated a long time ago that showed managers acting as ‘umbrellas,’ protecting their team from interruptions and other managers who kind of direct problems at their team,” Larson says. “I used to be a big believer in the umbrella concept; I wanted to protect my team from the reality and problems around them so they could focus.”&nbsp;</p><blockquote>The more senior teams I’ve worked with, the more I’ve come to believe that protecting your team from reality just makes things worse for them in the long term.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Now, Larson tries to throw his team into the gory details much more quickly. “In the past, I used to think I was energizing my team by sparing them the details. But now it feels like lying to them,” he says. On a tactical level, Larson adjusted this habit by buffering less information. “That means even if it’s disappointing for folks, I’d rather them process news bit by bit, rather than deal with a huge ocean of mess all in one moment.”&nbsp;</p><p>One other tactic to try here is to simply give both managers and engineers a seat at the table when big conversations are being had, rather than relying on yourself to represent so many different viewpoints. “I’m a big believer in bringing folks into the room so that they can represent themselves rather than having small decision groups. I like working out problems in larger groups where you can hold people accountable for showing up in thoughtful and effective ways,”&nbsp; Larson says.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>While we’re on the topic of bringing in more people, Larson also found that strategic decision-making is often in need of a fresh perspective. Whether you’re new to a company or have been scaling the same team for years, he examines the two most common approaches: </p><ul><li><strong>The Bottoms-Up Strategy. </strong>This is the hands-off approach to management, where executives essentially just let teams execute on their own. The reigning theory here is that if something major occurs, like switching to a new cloud vendor or a team starting to use a different programming language, it will naturally escalate up to the CTO, who can pass judgment on it. “There's a good amount of literature about how this approach empowers teams to move quickly and have control over their tools,” Larson says. “The downside is you have no ability to make concentrated technology investments and you usually find out information a little bit too late. But in a growth moment where you have a ton of budget and you want to optimize for 1 in 100 wins, bottoms-up investments can be great.”</li><li><strong>Top-down strategy. </strong>The other common model is where a few senior folks (typically either a CTO or a handful of people who make up an architecture group) make most of the decisions for the whole org. But Larson says these aren’t always the best for every decision. “Chief architects and CTOs are pretty inefficient in terms of actually getting enough context in their heads to make a good decision on any given point,” he says. “Almost every architecture group turns into a committee where they have to balance their different perspectives, making them slow or inelegant. <strong>It's rarely true that a committee gets the best decision, though the upside is it does at least bring all the context into the room.” &nbsp;</strong></li></ul><h3 id="use-%E2%80%9Cnavigators%E2%80%9D-to-speed-up-decision-making"><strong>Use “Navigators” to Speed Up Decision-Making&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Unsatisfied with the outcomes from both of these approaches, Larson decided to try something a little different for his latest role. “At Carta, we have a handful of different business units, so to <a href="https://review.firstround.com/how-to-make-decisions-faster/#to-evaluate-the-strength-of-an-idea-and-see-if-it%E2%80%99ll-have-staying-power-use-the-prfaq-approach-from-amazon-as-you-identify-key-assumptions-and-risks"><u>speed up our decision-making </u></a>we’ve been relying on people we call ‘navigators.’ Essentially, we appoint one person per business unit to act as a mini-CTO. They get to be the final decision maker for their area’s technology.”&nbsp;</p><p>For example, think of the fund administration area of Carta’s business. “On that team, we have one navigator and 60 engineers working together. In many other areas at Carta, we’ve started rolling out Kafka as a messaging system, but the navigator in fund administration called out that they didn’t think it was the right tool for them to use. So they didn’t. We’ve seen a lot of success by empowering the folks with the most context on the ground to make the tech-stack decisions that make the most sense for them.”&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond this role being a good blend of different ways to execute, navigators call back to Larson’s earlier point on building a culture that rewards good judgment and leaders to spot changes and reverse course on the rules. If you are curious to try something similar for your org, Larson shares three lessons he’s learned so far: <br></p><ul><li><strong>Don’t skip your documentation: &nbsp;</strong>“We have a written strategy there to guide navigators when making decisions,” Larson says. “They can make exceptions if they want to, and then they're accountable to me in terms of the exceptions they make. But it all gets written down.” <br></li><li><strong>Do a post-mortem: </strong>“I always like to follow up with navigators after a decision is made. This is mostly because I’m curious, but it also helps me to see around corners I might have missed.” <br></li><li><strong>Be highly intentional in who you put conviction in. </strong>While a pure management view dictates that companies should be resilient to departures and that <a href="https://lethain.com/load-bearing-career-minded-act-two-rationales/?ref=review.firstround.com"><u>people should not be load-bearing</u></a>, Larson ultimately feels that good judgment is difficult to replicate. So when choosing a navigator, don’t ignore your gut on who you trust. “You want to be extremely explicit in who is approved to exercise their judgment,” Larson says. “The point of a navigator is to have all questions routed up to one person, that’s not you as the executive. So spending time digging into people’s decision-making process is worthwhile.”&nbsp;</li></ul><blockquote>Organizations, even large ones, are just the culmination of a few individuals’ judgments. No amount of budget can allow you to escape that.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Zooming out, as an engineering team starts to scale alongside a company, leaders shouldn’t lose sight of what has gotten so many well-meaning execs into messes before: Following the rules too closely. “Your ultimate goal is to create this high-quality mechanism around people being curious and looking for the exceptions,” Larson says. But that also doesn’t mean that leaders have to figure out the answers for everything alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Larson has been holding a bi-weekly <a href="https://lethain.com/rough-notes-learning-circles/?ref=review.firstround.com"><u>“learning circle”</u></a> for the past three and a half years. It’s a group of six to ten CTOs, VPs of Engineering or other senior engineering executives at tech companies who come together to catch up, exchange tactics and process issues together.&nbsp;</p><p>“We start each meeting out by going around the room and giving each person one minute to say what they are focused on this week and give a topic they’d like to talk about. After five minutes or so talking about topics, we choose one as a group and spend the next 20 minutes or so really drilling into it,” he says. Topics range from “I’m getting screwed over by this project,” to “I just hired someone really good that I’m excited about.”&nbsp;</p><p>For those who learn by doing, leaning into routine reflections like a learning circle or solo can force the introspection needed to scale rules with nuance. “I’ve become a better leader learning from the lessons of others who have made similar mistakes before me,” Larson says.&nbsp;</p><div><p><em>This article is a lightly edited transcript of our interview with Larson on the In Depth podcast.

            <p>Two years ago, on June 1st, 2022, <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-orion-public-beta">Kagi introduced</a> a search engine that challenged the ad-supported version of the web. Kagi Search instead works for you, the user, and not an advertiser paying for your attention. At the time of launch, we did not know if anyone would pay for their search engine and web browser, but luckily, here we are two years later at the forefront of a movement to humanize the internet’s most-used products and put the user back in the driving seat.</p>

<p>This blog post is meant to provide an update to our community and future members on where we are and what our plans for the future are.</p>

<center><em>Public comment from a member on Reddit 🙏</em></center>

<p>Support like this not only means a lot to us but has been the main driver of Kagi adoption so far, and for that we are forever thankful!</p>

<h2><a name="3"></a>New shareholders and team members</h2>

<p>We are excited to announce that so far, 93 Kagi members have joined Kagi as investors through our two investment rounds, most recent closing a few weeks ago. The investment not only brought in capital (which we will use for hiring, R&amp;D and search index expansion) but also strengthens our community-centric approach, as these investors are also users who deeply believe in our mission. The rest of the company remains owned by the founder, employees, and advisors, ensuring that those who are directly involved in building and sustaining Kagi have a significant stake in its success.</p>

<p>This diverse ownership structure fosters a sense of shared purpose and collaboration and aligns the incentives of everyone involved. Having users as investors provides invaluable insights and feedback (and sometimes key leadership talent!), helping us better understand and meet their needs. It also reinforces our commitment to transparency and accountability, as we are directly answerable to a community that is both invested in and supportive of our long-term vision. While we have no immediate plans to raise additional funding, if you are interested to be notified about any future fundraising, <a href="https://forms.gle/1Try2v6JtXbKSjKx9">get in touch</a>.</p>

<center><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-22/1716360672-296077-screenshot-2024-05-21-at-235107.png" width="600"></center>
<center><em>Kagi team members around the globe</em></center>

<p>Our team has expanded to 37 people around the globe, working together to bring a friendly version of the web to people, families, and organizations worldwide. We are actively <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/company/hiring-kagi.html">hiring</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="4"></a>Kagi becomes a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)</h2>

<p>The Delaware public benefit corporation (PBC) is an entity created by amendment to the Delaware General Corporation Law in 2013, and is structurally identical to the familiar Delaware C corporation with one major difference: company directors and officers are given explicit permission to consider a purpose beyond simply maximizing shareholder value.</p>

<p>Kagi transitioned to a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), marking a significant milestone in our journey. This structural change allows the legal entity to consider a purpose beyond simply maximizing shareholder value, balancing it with the best interests of all stakeholders, including the communities we serve, along with the specific public benefit.</p>

<p>In particular, the public benefit statement entered into Kagi’s charter is: “<strong>Kagi is committed to creating a more human-centric and sustainable web that benefits individuals, communities, and society as a whole, with a transparent business model that aligns the incentives of everyone involved.</strong>”</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-22/1716360472-761510-screenshot-2024-05-21-at-234747.png" alt="Kagi PBC"></p>

<p>This transition ensures that our mission-driven approach is not just a guiding principle but a legal obligation, protecting us from external pressures that might otherwise divert us from our path. The PBC designation also resonates with our community of users, who value ethical business practices and corporate responsibility. It provides a clear signal that Kagi is dedicated to making a positive impact on the world, aligning our business practices with the broader goal of societal benefit.</p>

<p>Some examples of companies structured as PBC  out there include Laureate, Plum Organics, Kickstarter and Anthropic. We’d like to thank <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Ries">Eric Ries</a> for introducing us to the PBC structure.  You can read more about it <a href="https://kagi.com/search?q=public+benefit+corporation+PBC&amp;r=us&amp;sh=FuSMLpCLQlOTugxwnnQo6g">on Kagi</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="5"></a>Kagi’s unique approach to search</h2>

<p>From day one, Kagi Search was built with one goal in mind — show the world that a high-quality, user-centric search engine is possible. Why was this not possible before? In short, in every market economy, there has to be a customer. For search, that customer can be either you or an advertiser, and this simple choice determines all incentives and outcomes in the search experience. With Kagi, for the first time in history of search engines, you are the customer and everything is built around you and your needs alone.</p>

<p>And we know what our customers want because it is the same thing we want: no ads, no spam, no low-quality content, and no insult to our intelligence from the search engine we use. We want results that include human discussions, not LLM-generated content. We value opinions and expertise from personal websites and blogs over ad-filled, and tracking-infested content silos.</p>

<p>We want to explore and discover the web, versus being told what to buy. We want to connect to and understand other humans and their work, not be consumers of the content created with the only purpose of monetizing our attention and wasting our time and brain cycles in the process.</p>

<p>And this is what Kagi strives to deliver.</p>

<p>For instance, when you ask your search engine a programming question, you want to see official documentation, industry experts, personal blogs, and other authentic sources of information.</p>

<center><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-22/1716392268-405998-screenshot-2024-05-22-at-083623.png"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-22/1716392268-405998-screenshot-2024-05-22-at-083623.png"></a></center>
<center><em>User-centric vs ad-supported, click to enlarge</em></center>

<p>Similarly, searching for “best headphones” should yield genuine recommendations, not headphone ads from the highest bidder. What you often find in Kagi is information from people who are truly knowledgeable and passionate about their topic.</p>

<center><a href="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-22/1716392725-691336-screenshot-2024-05-22-at-084426.png"><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-22/1716392725-691336-screenshot-2024-05-22-at-084426.png"></a></center>

<p>These massive public forums are among the most active web search and browser product communities on the web, reflecting the incredible level of engagement and valuable insights provided by our users. This is also why <strong>we do not have or need any telemetry in our products</strong> - we can barely keep up with what our users are directly asking us to do!</p>

<h2><a name="6"></a>Orion - Web browser that has your back</h2>

<center><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-30/1717079482-339174-04.png"></center>
<center><em>Orion is a lightweight Mac browser, with native support for horizontal, vertical and compact tabs</em></center>

<p>Most people may not know this, but Kagi started developing <a href="https://kagi.com/orion">Orion browser</a> even before the search engine (and Orion’s feedback forum has almost twice as many discussion than the one for Kagi Search!). It is clear to us that no successful search engine could thrive without a companion web browser built on the same set of core values, including the alignment of all incentives.</p>

<p>We are pleased to see so many people excited about the prospect of Orion and willing to <a href="https://kagi.com/orion/orionplus.html">pay for it</a>, which may sound like an even more “outrageous” idea than paying for search.</p>

<p>But think about it: a web browser is one of the most important and intimate tools we use on our computers and devices every single day, yet we as a society, have somehow allowed most browsers in use to be directly or indirectly paid for and controlled by advertisers! It is like the situation with search, just worse. This is insanity to me and this is why we are building Orion, a user-centric web browser with a paid business model and no other sources of revenue, to bring sanity back and help support our mission to humanize the web.</p>

<center><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-30/1717079301-260116-screenshot-2024-05-30-at-072813.png"></center>
<center><em>Native support for web extensions, profiles, and much more…</em></center>

<p>Orion is WebKit-based, built from scratch for high performance, zero-telemetry by default, <a href="https://kagi.com/orion/#privacy">truly privacy respecting</a>, with built-in ad and tracking blocking like no other web browser in the world. On top of that, we brought the same Web Extensions API used by Chrome and Firefox to WebKit, allowing Orion to run both Chrome and Firefox extensions natively out of the box (you can follow <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14IgSRVop4psUTgtLZlvYJYrAArhvL3WvRlUdzdQbIoQ/edit?usp=sharing">our progress</a>, with many extensions already working, including on iOS!).</p>

<p>For the Mac fans out there, you will be pleased to know that Orion has ported the latest WebKit to macOS Mojave and Catalina, even though Apple stopped updating it years ago. Yes, it is incredibly hard to do this and maintain it with our limited resources, but we believe it should be done, and we are known for doing things the hard way.</p>

<center><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-30/1717083278-428587-screen-shot-2024-05-30-at-83125-am.png"></center>
<center><em>Orion on macOS Catalina using WebKit that is newer than not only WebKit in Safari on Catalina, but also the one used in Safari on Sonoma. Kudos for the Orion dev team.</em></center>

<p>And the best thing - Orion is free (truly free, not like ad-supported browser “free”) and you can choose to <a href="https://kagi.com/orion/orionplus.html">pay for it</a> and support your browser directly.</p>

<p>We continue to work very hard on Orion, aiming to exit beta status by the beginning of 2025. It is currently <a href="https://kagi.com/orion/#download_sec">available</a> for Mac and iPhone/iPad, with plans (resource permitting) to expand to Windows, Android, and Linux.</p>

<h2><a name="7"></a>Chapter 2: Setting up for success</h2>

<p>The relentless pursuit of excellence ensures that Kagi users receive a seamless and trustworthy search experience, setting us apart in an industry driven by ads, tracking, and misaligned incentives.</p>

<center><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-22/1716359822-625955-screenshot-2024-05-21-at-233656.png" width="700"></center>
<center><em>Note from a Kagi member, shown with their permission</em></center>

<p>As we look behind us, we are proud of what we have built together over the last two years, with our incredible member community.</p>

<p>We realize that we are now entering the next chapter of Kagi’s journey, Chapter 2, where we are intensifying our focus on craftsmanship and delighting users, supported by a more mature organization.</p>

<p>We have hired key leadership positions to lead our efforts in these critical areas.</p>

<center><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2024-05-22/1716358485-924099-img-7462.jpg" width="600"></center>
<center><em>Kagi leadership meeting, New York, April 2024.<br> From left to right: Zac Nowicki, Vladimir Prelovac, Hugh O’Brien, Luis Da Silva.</em></center>

<p>Additionally, we are reorganizing our internal structure, creating specialized teams, establishing new processes, and setting ourselves up for success over the next two years.</p>

<h3><a name="8"></a>Moving forward: Relentless focus on core search experience</h3>

<p>In a rapidly evolving digital landscape where “AI” continues to dominate the conversation, especially in search (it is almost as if the rest of the industry forgot that the purpose of search engines is to focus on relevant search results), Kagi’s unwavering commitment to refining the core search experience has never been more critical.</p>

<p>We are dedicated to delivering the most accurate, privacy-respecting, and user-centric search results, reinforcing our belief that the human element remains essential in the search experience. We will be investing in expanding our index, launching an API so that everyone can build on top of Kagi’s search quality, and improving the UX of search itself with new widgets, customization and quality of life improvements.</p>

<p>We recognize that the search experience should be intuitive, fast, reliable, and most importantly, of the highest possible quality. As such, our development efforts are centered around improving search algorithms, expanding our own index, reducing latency, and ensuring that our platform remains free of low-quality and LLM-generated content.</p>

<h3><a name="9"></a>What about “AI”?</h3>

<p>Although “AI” has been used in search for decades, it has recently resurfaced in public discourse with the proliferation of large language models (LLMs). We never integrated features (including AI) for the sake of having them, but did so <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-ai-search#philosophy">as thoughtfully as we could</a> to enhance the user experience without compromising our core values. The job of technology is not to make humans do more; the job of technology is to make our journey in this world more enjoyable.</p>

<p>I have been using LLMs as a tool for coding (acknowledging their <a href="https://x.com/vladquant/status/1791341643351880050">limitations</a>). I am using them for factual summarization through Kagi’s <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/quick-answer.html">Quick Answer</a> and <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/assistant.html">Assistant</a>, which are on-demand features that work well thanks to grounding in Kagi Search. And as someone diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my hands, I will rely increasingly on voice-to-text AI for typing and interaction. I believe that other AI modalities, such as image understanding, will greatly improve the quality of life for people with disabilities like visual impairment.</p>

<p>LLM research has produced advanced models, and some companies have paved the way for the public to accept paying $20-$30 per month to use top LLMs. We see an opportunity to compete in this market with Kagi Assistant. We will offer access to world’s best LLMs, with answers grounded in Kagi Search, all in one place and included in a single $25/month Kagi Ultimate subscription. Kagi Assistant is currently in <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/assistant.html">open beta</a>, with the full version expected to launch in July.</p>

<p>It is clear that the quality of any AI integration built on top of search will only be as good as the underlying search engine. Our primary goal is to keep providing the best search results in the world.</p>

<h3><a name="10"></a>Roadmap ahead</h3>

<p>Our roadmap includes several ambitious projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Expansion of Kagi’s own index, aiming to cover 100 million of the highest quality pages on the web. (we will keep focusing on quality vs quantity.)</li>
<li>Doing more with the wonderful <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/small-web">Kagi Small Web</a> initiative that has grown to over 12,000 websites and is <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb">open-source</a>.</li>
<li>A complete revamp of our search widgets, including stock, sports, weather, and calculator widgets, including <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/d/36-custom-widgetscomputer-plugins">user-defined widgets</a> - all right inside search results.</li>
<li>Launching Kagi mobile apps for both iOS and Android platforms.</li>
<li>Launching <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/assistant.html">Kagi Assistant</a>: Access the world’s best LLMs, grounded in Kagi Search.</li>
<li>Kagi Maps, based on Mapbox and OpenStreetMap.</li>
<li><a href="https://kagi.com/orion">Orion Browser</a> exiting public beta and offering high-performance (WebKit based), zero-telemetry, ad-free, and tracking-free browsing. Also, similar to Kagi Search, you can <a href="https://kagi.com/orion/orionplus.html">pay for your browser</a>.</li>
<li>Seamless integration between Kagi products, for great user experience inside our ecosystem.</li>
<li>Launch of Kagi Search APIs to enable others to build upon our legendary search results.</li>
<li>Expanding our offering to enterprise and education sectors with a tailored solution. (We’d love to see Kagi in schools, and if you would as well, <a href="mailto:vlad@kagi.com">let us know</a> or mention Kagi to your kid’s teacher.)</li>
</ul>

</p><center><em>Kagi product roadmap. Dates are aspirational.</em></center>

<p>These initiatives are designed to enhance our core search offering, introduce other products with the same core values to our ecosystem, enlarge the number of people who will benefit from Kagi, and provide even more value to our member community included in their subscription. We are excited about the future and committed to delivering on these promises, one step at a time.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
				<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Lumen Technologies’ Black Lotus Labs</span> <span data-contrast="none">identified a destructive event, as over 600,000 small office/home office (SOHO) routers were taken offline belonging to a single internet service provider (ISP). The incident took place over a 72-hour period between October 25-27, rendered the infected devices permanently inoperable, and required a hardware-based replacement. Public scan data confirmed the sudden and precipitous removal of 49% of all modems from the impacted ISP’s autonomous system number (ASN) during this time period.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Our analysis identified “Chalubo,” a commodity remote access trojan (RAT), as the primary payload responsible for the event. This trojan, </span><a href="https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2018/10/22/chalubo-botnet-wants-to-ddos-from-your-server-or-iot-device/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">first identified in 2018</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, employed savvy tradecraft to obfuscate its activity; it removed all files from disk to run in-memory, assumed a random process name already present on the device, and encrypted all communications with the command and control (C2) server. We suspect these factors contributed to there being only </span><span data-contrast="auto">one report on the Chalubo malware family</span><span data-contrast="none"> to date. Chalubo has payloads designed for all major SOHO/IoT kernels, pre-built functionality to perform DDoS attacks, and can execute any Lua script sent to the bot. We suspect the Lua functionality was likely employed by the malicious actor to retrieve the destructive payload.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Lumen’s global telemetry indicates the Chalubo malware family was highly active in November 2023 and remained so into early 2024. Based on a 30-day snapshot in October, Lumen identified over 330,000 unique IP addresses that communicated with one of 75 observed C2 nodes for at least two days, indicating a confirmed infection. This suggests that while the Chalubo malware was used in this destructive attack, it was not written specifically for destructive actions. We suspect the threat actors behind this event chose a commodity malware family to obfuscate attribution, instead of using a custom-developed toolkit. At this time, we do not have an overlap between this activity and any known nation-state activity clusters. We assess with high confidence that the malicious firmware update was a deliberate act intended to cause an outage, and </span><span data-contrast="none">thought</span><span data-contrast="none"> we expected to see a number of router make and models affected across the internet, this event was confined to the single ASN.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Destructive attacks of this nature are highly concerning, especially so in this case. A sizeable portion of this ISP’s service area covers </span><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2021/09/08/a-primer-on-rural-broadband-deployment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">rural or underserved</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> communities; places where residents may have lost access to emergency services, farming concerns may have lost critical information from remote monitoring of crops during the harvest, and health care providers cut off from telehealth or patients’ records. Needless to say, recovery from any supply chain disruption takes longer in isolated or vulnerable communities.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">This report will walk through the open-source observations surrounding the attack, and transition into discussing the infection process we observed in October 2023. We will dissect the malware functionality, subsequent malware families dropped, and the malware family’s global footprint.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Having verified a potential impact to a specific ASN, we queried Black Lotus Labs global telemetry for connections from that ASN, leading us to the first payload server – which had an open directory.

<p><em>Figure 3: Excerpt of the malicious script</em></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Next, the get_scrpc script decides if the md5 hash of the usb2rci file matches a known string. If not matched, it retrieves the payload from one of the first stage payload servers. One such URL was hxxp://104.233.210[.]119:51248/get_fwuueicj. The last step retrieves a second bash script called “get_strtriiusj.” This script verifies the presence of a file named “/tmp/.adiisu,” if the file was present it would exit. If not, it would create the file, then copy the main payload file to the /tmp/ directory and rename it “/tmp/crrs.” With access to the tmp directory it can modify the permissions to make it executable, and then execute the file. This loader file appeared to be compiled on October 25, 2023, at 9:55:18 UTC. It was a big-endian shared object, .so file, compiled for MIPS R3000 CPU.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">When the malware ran, it attempted to retrieve some host-based information such as the MAC address, device ID, device type, device version and the local IP. Chalubo would first try to send that information to the threat actor-created domain and URL at coreconfig[.]net8080/E2XRIEGSOAPU3Z5Q8. If unable to resolve the domain, it would fall back to the hard-coded IP address 185.189.240[.]13, which is where the current domain resolved on October 30, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">As for the binary “get_fwuueicj,” it first forks itself and then attempts to open the file “/tmp/tmp.lck,” or “/var/tmp/tmp.lck” and then “/data/local/tmp/tmp.lck” if /tmp/tmp.lck fails.</span><br>

</ul>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The only mistake we observed on the threat actor’s part was in using the exact same encryption key and nonce that was previously documented in the 2018 report. Another oddity stood out during analysis as we identified a handful of commands related to DDoS functions, however, when we saw infected machines receive commands to launch DDoS attacks, they did not use the embedded binaries’ functionality. This further suggests a disconnect between the developers and operators of some bots. We assess that it would be trivial to use this Lua execution feature to retrieve subsequent payloads from other locations on the internet.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span><br>
<span data-contrast="none">As we see in the graphic below, the binary began by forking and making the same changes to the </span><i><span data-contrast="none">oom_adj </span></i><span data-contrast="none">and </span><i><span data-contrast="none">oom_score_adj </span></i><span data-contrast="none">files, deleting itself on disk, and renaming the process to a random filename.

<p>The script contains the same hardcoded C2s as the previous stage, but the URL is appended with “/res.dat” instead of the architecture.

<h2>Global Telemetry Associated with Chalubo Malware</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While there were interactions between the impacted ASN and payload servers, we needed to determine if this was an isolated event or if similar activity patterns were occurring elsewhere in the world with other Chalubo bot infections. Examining the bot’s ecosystem, we found that from September to November of 2023, there were about 45 malware panels on the internet. While 28 of the panels interacted with 10 or fewer bots, the top ten panels interacted with anywhere between ~13,500 to ~117,000 unique IP addresses over a 30-day timeframe. Telemetry associated with those IP addresses revealed that over 650K unique IP addresses had contact with at least one controller over a 30-day period ending on November 3. Another observation from this timeframe showed that 95% of the bots communicated with only one control panel. This suggests the entity behind these operations had distinct silos of operations: whereas most botnets tend to communicate with multiple C2 nodes for greater redundancy in case one server was taken offline. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A closer look at the data showed that roughly half of those bots communicated with C2s for just one to two days. We felt this could denote various internet noise, such as scanners or security researchers, so we removed all suspect IP addresses from the dataset. With the cleaned dataset we plotted the IP addresses and their corresponding country for the timeframe in which the event took place, and generated the following heat map: </span><br>
<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="http://blog.lumen.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/brickFig14.jpg" alt="" width="1304" height="582"></p>
<p><em>Figure 14: Global heat map showing the distribution of bots by distinct IP addresses October 2023</em></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">By analyzing the controllers, we identified a tier-two server located at 103.140.187[.]149, which appeared to administer controllers around the globe. Using URLScan to investigate this address brought us to the </span><a href="https://urlscan.io/result/e7681c6c-5a46-4c35-b5d0-f7fd5ee2c001/"><span data-contrast="none">landing page</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, which showed only a login panel.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">During this timeframe only one panel was used for the destructive attack. This led us to believe that while Chalubo itself was the RAT used to perform the destructive event, not all Chalubo infections resulted in a destructive attack. This suggests that the malicious cyber actor behind this event likely purchased a panel for non-attribution.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Black Lotus Labs has reported on SOHO activity from </span><a href="https://blog.lumen.com/hacktivist-campaign-spreads-manifesto-through-router-configuration-files/"><span data-contrast="none">hacktivist</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><a href="https://blog.lumen.com/chaos-is-a-go-based-swiss-army-knife-of-malware/"><span data-contrast="none">cybercriminals</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="https://blog.lumen.com/routers-roasting-on-an-open-firewall-the-kv-botnet-investigation/"><span data-contrast="none">nation-state actors</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> over the past several years. However, this investigation stood out for two reasons. First, this campaign resulted in a hardware-based replacement of the affected devices, which likely indicates that the attacker corrupted the firmware on specific models. The event was unprecedented due to the number of units affected – no attack that we can recall has required the replacement of over 600,000 devices. In addition, this type of attack has only ever happened once before, with AcidRain used as a precursor to an active military invasion. At this time, we do not assess this to be the work of a nation-state or state-sponsored entity. In fact, we have not observed any overlap with known destructive activity clusters; particularly those prone to destructive events such as Volt Typhoon, or SeaShell Blizzard.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The second unique aspect is that this campaign was confined to a particular ASN. Most previous campaigns we’ve seen target a specific router model or common vulnerability and have effects across multiple providers’ networks. In this instance, we observed that both Sagemcom and ActionTec devices were impacted at the same time, both within the same provider’s network. This led us to assess it was not the result of a faulty firmware update by a single manufacturer, which would normally be confined to one device model or models from a given company. Our analysis of the Censys data shows the impact was only for the two in question. This combination of factors led us to conclude the event was likely a deliberate action taken by an unattributed malicious cyber actor, even if we were not able to recover the destructive module.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Black Lotus Labs has added the IoCs from both this campaign and the Chalubo malware into the threat intelligence feed that fuels the Lumen Connected Security portfolio. We continue to monitor new infrastructure, targeting activity, and expanding TTPs including those in this report, and will provide updates as appropriate.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We will continue to collaborate with the security research community to share findings related to this activity and ensure the public is informed. We encourage the community to monitor as well as alert on these and any similar IoCs.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>Law enforcement agencies in the United States and Europe today announced <strong>Operation Endgame</strong>, a coordinated action against some of the most popular cybercrime platforms for delivering ransomware and data-stealing malware. Dubbed “the largest ever operation against botnets,” the international effort is being billed as the opening salvo in an ongoing campaign targeting advanced malware “droppers” or “loaders” like&nbsp;<strong>IcedID</strong>, <strong>Smokeloader</strong> and <strong>Trickbot</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_67699"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67699" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/endgamestill.png" alt="" width="749" height="678" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/endgamestill.png 998w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/endgamestill-768x696.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/endgamestill-782x708.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-67699">A frame from one of three animated videos released today in connection with Operation Endgame.</p></div>
<p>Operation Endgame targets the cybercrime ecosystem supporting droppers/loaders, slang terms used to describe tiny, custom-made programs designed to surreptitiously install malware onto a target system. Droppers are typically used in the initial stages of a breach, and they allow cybercriminals to bypass security measures and deploy additional harmful programs, including viruses, ransomware, or spyware.</p>
<p>Droppers like IcedID are most often deployed through email attachments, hacked websites, or bundled with legitimate software. For example, cybercriminals have long used <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/01/using-google-search-to-find-software-can-be-risky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid ads on Google to trick people into installing malware</a> disguised as popular free software, such as Microsoft Teams, Adobe Reader and Discord. In those cases, the dropper is the hidden component bundled with the legitimate software that quietly loads malware onto the user’s system.</p>
<p>Droppers remain such a critical, human-intensive component of nearly all major cybercrime enterprises that the most popular have turned into full-fledged cybercrime services of their own. By targeting the individuals who develop and maintain dropper services and their supporting infrastructure, authorities are hoping to disrupt multiple cybercriminal operations simultaneously.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/largest-ever-operation-against-botnets-hits-dropper-malware-ecosystem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> from the European police agency <strong>Europol</strong>, between May 27 and May 29, 2024 authorities arrested four suspects (one in Armenia and three in Ukraine), and disrupted or took down more than 100 Internet servers in Bulgaria, Canada, Germany, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Romania, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, United States and Ukraine. Authorities say they also seized more than 2,000 domain names that supported dropper infrastructure online.</p>
<p>In addition, Europol released information on eight fugitives suspected of involvement in dropper services and who are wanted by Germany; their names and photos were added to Europol’s “Most Wanted” list on 30 May 2024.<span id="more-67691"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_67696"><p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/europol-mostwanted-de.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67696" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/europol-mostwanted-de.png" alt="" width="748" height="329" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/europol-mostwanted-de.png 1307w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/europol-mostwanted-de-768x337.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/europol-mostwanted-de-782x343.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-67696">A “wanted” poster including the names and photos of eight suspects wanted by Germany and now on Europol’s “Most Wanted” list.</p></div>
<p>“It has been discovered through the investigations so far that one of the main suspects has earned at least EUR 69 million in cryptocurrency by renting out criminal infrastructure sites to deploy ransomware,” Europol wrote. “The suspect’s transactions are constantly being monitored and legal permission to seize these assets upon future actions has already been obtained.”</p>
<p>There have been <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/08/u-s-hacks-qakbot-quietly-removes-botnet-infections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">numerous such coordinated malware takedown efforts</a> in the past, and yet often the substantial amount of coordination required between law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity firms involved is not sustained after the initial disruption and/or arrests.</p>
<p>But a new website erected to detail today’s action — <a href="https://www.operation-endgame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">operation-endgame.com</a> — makes the case that this time is different, and that more takedowns and arrests are coming. “Operation Endgame does not end today,” the site promises. “New actions will be announced on this website.”</p>
<div id="attachment_67697"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67697" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/endgame-think.png" alt="" width="633" height="521"></p><p id="caption-attachment-67697">A message on operation-endgame.com promises more law enforcement and disruption actions.</p></div>
<p>Perhaps in recognition that many of today’s top cybercriminals reside in countries that are effectively beyond the reach of international law enforcement, actions like Operation Endgame seem increasingly focused on mind games — i.e., trolling the hackers.</p>
<p>Writing in this month’s issue of <em>Wired</em>, <strong>Matt Burgess</strong> makes the case that Western law enforcement officials have turned to psychological measures as an added way to slow down Russian hackers and cut to the heart of the sweeping cybercrime ecosystem.</p>
<p>“These nascent psyops include efforts to erode the limited trust the criminals have in each other, driving subtle wedges between fragile hacker egos, and sending offenders personalized messages showing they’re being watched,” Burgess <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cop-cybercriminal-hacker-psyops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>When authorities in the U.S. and U.K. announced in February 2024 that they’d <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/02/feds-seize-lockbit-ransomware-websites-offer-decryption-tools-troll-affiliates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infiltrated and seized</a> the infrastructure used by the infamous <strong>LockBit</strong> ransomware gang, they borrowed the existing design of LockBit’s victim shaming website to link instead to press releases about the takedown, and included a countdown timer that was eventually replaced with the personal details of <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/how-did-authorities-identify-the-alleged-lockbit-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LockBit’s alleged leader</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_66436"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-66436" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lockbitseized.png" alt="" width="750" height="474" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lockbitseized.png 1379w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lockbitseized-768x486.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lockbitseized-782x494.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-66436">The feds used the existing design on LockBit’s victim shaming website to feature press releases and free decryption tools.</p></div>
<p>The Operation Endgame website also includes a countdown timer, which serves to tease the release of several animated videos that mimic the same sort of flashy, short advertisements that established cybercriminals often produce to promote their services online. At least two of the videos include a substantial amount of text written in Russian.</p>
<p>The coordinated takedown comes on the heels of another law enforcement action this week against what the director of the FBI called “<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/is-your-computer-part-of-the-largest-botnet-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely the world’s largest botnet ever</a>.” On Wednesday <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> (DOJ) announced the arrest of <strong>YunHe Wang</strong>, the alleged operator of the ten-year-old online anonymity service <strong>911 S5</strong>. The government also seized 911 S5’s domains and online infrastructure, which allegedly turned computers running various “free VPN” products into Internet traffic relays that facilitated billions of dollars in online fraud and cybercrime.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>The problem with vector-only search</h2><p>At Assembled, <a href="https://www.assembled.com/blog/unveiling-assembled-assist">our issue resolution engine</a> is designed to assist customer support by suggesting potential answers to support queries. We use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for much of this pipeline because it's quicker to iterate on than fine-tuning, doesn’t require training on customer data (which many companies prefer), and generally provides high-quality results.</p><p>However, we encountered a significant challenge with RAG: relying solely on vector search (even using both dense and sparse vectors) doesn’t always deliver satisfactory results for certain queries. This issue was particularly evident when users entered specific keywords that didn’t accurately match stored knowledge articles.</p><p>Customer support teams often have multiple articles on similar topics and lack a tightly curated knowledge base, leading vector search to sometimes return irrelevant results to our RAG engine and reduce response accuracy. Users familiar with traditional keyword searches were puzzled when our system couldn't find the right documents, especially for short queries with prominent but ambiguous keywords.</p><p>For example, if a user asked “what features are included in a premium plan?”, vector search would excel at pulling documents about different plans, customer testimonials, or marketing materials. However, vector search would often fail at finding articles specifically targeting premium plans.</p><h2>The solution: Hybrid Search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion</h2><p>To address this issue, we integrated a new keyword search infrastructure that combines its results with vector search for optimal performance. In the above example, keyword search would hone in on “features”, “premium”, and “plan”, and narrow search results to documents specifically matching these keywords. A hybrid approach with both vector and keyword search allows us to effectively return articles with semantic matches while also providing users with the familiar feel of traditional keyword search. Our intuition was based on our experience with other machine learning systems where ensemble models <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/improving-retrieval-performance-in-rag-pipelines-with-hybrid-search-c75203c2f2f5">generally outperform single models</a>.</p><h3>Document store abstraction</h3><p>To enable a hybrid store solution, we developed a document store abstraction in our code, allowing us to integrate multiple search algorithms. The abstraction is simple but captures all the essential functionalities of a document store and search system. It handles document management and querying and is agnostic to the actual implementation (vector search, keyword search, etc.). Here’s what it looks like:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/610225ff318d106f5343df0c/66560d105c674222981cdd13_Screenshot%202024-05-28%20at%209.57.24%E2%80%AFAM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>With this abstraction, we had the primitives we needed to swap different search systems in and out easily. Uploading a document could be done once and then sync across multiple document stores. Similarly, searching for a document could be done in parallel across multiple document stores using a standardized query.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/610225ff318d106f5343df0c/66560c2a2d3e9978690f41d9_hybridsearch.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The interesting part is that our hybrid search store itself implements the <strong><code>DocumentStore</code></strong> interface. This means that, from the perspective of the caller, it doesn't matter whether they are interacting with a single store or our complex hybrid store — they use the same interface and methods. This design ensures that all of the logic for determining which documents are retrieved is hidden from the caller and can be tested separately. To implement the hybrid store, we passed in multiple child document stores and parallelized the search across all of the child stores.</p><h3>Syncing documents across stores</h3><p>Enabling multiple document stores introduced technical challenges, especially around ensuring synchronization. Out-of-sync document stores could lead to subtle bugs, such as a document being present in one store but not another. To address this, we implemented the following:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Single source of truth:</strong> We maintain a document store in PostgreSQL (for metadata)&nbsp;and S3 (for the actual documents themselves) as a source of truth. This store implements document storage interfaces but is not included in queries. It serves solely for record keeping, allowing us to resync content if necessary.</li><li><strong>Asynchronous updates:</strong> Due to higher latency in storing articles, we first update our source of truth in the database and provide an acknowledgement to the frontend. We then asynchronously store the documents in our child stores. This approach helps manage latency across multiple stores and ensures our document stores are eventually consistent.</li><li><strong>Error handling:</strong> We also need to handle errors across different platforms. For example, one store might experience a network outage while another completes the storage process successfully. Our PostgreSQL database tracks the synchronization status of each store. If a store fails to sync, we employ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff">exponential backoff</a> to retry the operation, ensuring that all stores are eventually brought into sync.</li></ul><h2>Combining results across multiple search engines</h2><p>To optimize search performance, we explored several algorithms for merging the results from our different document stores.</p><h3>Weighting-based fusion</h3><p>Our initial approach involved experimenting with various weighting mechanisms for sparse/dense vectors and keyword search. The goal was to find optimal weightings that leverage the strengths of each search method. However, identifying the correct weightings proved challenging due to the unknown distribution of vector search scores. This variability made it difficult to determine the relative importance of different weightings.</p><p>What’s more, empirical data showed that similarity scores (dot product and Euclidean distance) varied widely across our customer base. The differential performance across these metrics made it impractical to develop a universal weighting scheme for combining vector and keyword searches. Tuning these weights on a per-customer basis was not scalable.</p><h3>Rank fusion</h3><p>Next, we turned to rank fusion algorithms, inspired by literature reviews and their demonstrated effectiveness in search optimization (see <a href="https://rodgerbenham.github.io/bc17-adcs.pdf">[0]</a> and <a href="https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf">[1]</a>). Rank fusion algorithms, particularly Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), provided a promising alternative. Here’s how most rank fusion algorithms work:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Rank assignment:</strong> Each document from the individual ranked lists is assigned a score based on its rank position. Typically, the score is the reciprocal of its rank (i.e., 1/rank). For example, a document ranked first gets a score of 1, the second gets 0.5, the third gets 0.33, and so on.</li><li><strong>Score summation:</strong> The scores from all ranked lists are summed for each document. Documents appearing in multiple lists accumulate higher combined scores.</li><li><strong>Final ranking:</strong> Documents are re-ranked based on their combined scores, producing a final ranked list that integrates the rankings from all individual search engines.</li></ol><h3>Why we chose RRF</h3><p>After extensive testing, Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) consistently outperformed many of the more complex methods we evaluated. Several factors contributed to this:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Simplicity and robustness:</strong> RRF's simplicity makes it less prone to overfitting specific scenarios, aligning with the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor">Occam’s razor</a>. This simplicity enhances its robustness across different contexts.</li><li><strong>Minimal tuning:</strong> RRF provides a straightforward and effective way to rank results without the need for extensive parameter tuning. This is particularly advantageous given our diverse customer base and their varying knowledge bases.</li></ul><p>By implementing RRF, we achieved a flexible and scalable method for combining search results. Using RRF, we not only enhanced the accuracy and relevance of search outcomes but also simplified the overall search infrastructure, ensuring a robust solution for our diverse customer set.</p><h2>Optimizing our search infrastructure</h2><p>Finally, a note on our search engine choices. At Assembled, we use <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/">Pinecone</a> for vector search and <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a> for keyword search. After minimal testing with other providers, we concluded that the marginal benefits of further optimization were not significant. Consequently, we decided against hosting our own open-source vector database, such as <a href="https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus">Milvus</a>, or managing our own keyword search on <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a>.</p><p>Using B2B solutions like Pinecone and Algolia offers several advantages:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Cost efficiency:</strong> These services are reasonably cost-effective (especially when comparing to engineering time) and eliminate the need for significant upfront investment in infrastructure.</li><li><strong>Maintenance reduction:</strong> Like most companies, we’re resource constrained by engineering resources, so by outsourcing to specialized search companies, we avoid the substantial maintenance burden associated with self-hosted solutions. This allows our team to focus on our core functionality of AI&nbsp;replies for support issues.</li><li><strong>Performance:</strong> Algolia in particular provides low-latency responses, a robust API, and highly optimized search outputs which would likely outperform anything we could build on Elasticsearch.</li></ul><h2>We’re hiring!</h2><p>We’re seeing exciting results, but there’s always a lot more to do. Since implementing this framework, there have been a lot of developments in RAG-based techniques, such as fine tuning of embedding models, applying matrix transformations on vector results, HyDE, etc. If you’re interested in helping us solve these problems, <a href="https://www.assembled.com/careers-at-assembled#openings">check out our open roles</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>
