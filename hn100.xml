<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/zlibr.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/zlibr.jpg" alt="zlibrary" width="280" height="138" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/zlibr.jpg 700w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/zlibr-18x9.jpg 18w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px"></a>On November 4, 2022, the United States Department of Justice and the FBI began <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-authorities-seize-z-library-domain-names-221104/">seizing Z-Library’s domains</a> as part of a major operation to shut down the infamous ‘shadow library’ platform.</p>
<p>A criminal investigation had identified two Russian nationals, Anton Napolsky and Valeriia Ermakova, as the alleged operators of the site. On October 21, 2022, at the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Judge Sanket J. Bulsara ordered their arrest. They were detained in Argentina on November 3, 2022. </p>
<p>After arriving at the Ambrosio Taravella International Airport, the unsuspecting couple cleared customs and hired a car from a popular rental company. The United States Embassy informed local authorities that the pair were subject to an Interpol Red Notice. </p>
<p>At what point the Russians’ phones were tapped is unclear but, under the authority of a Federal Court arrest warrant, Argentinian law enforcement began tracking the couple’s movements as they traveled south in their rented Toyota Corolla.</p>
<p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/z-lib-route.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/z-lib-route.png" alt="z-lib-route" width="200" height="303"></a>Using data submitted in support of a Chamber of Deputies (lower house of the Argentine Congress) inquiry and data made available elsewhere, we were able to recreate the route allegedly taken by Napolsky and Ermakova before their arrest.</p>
<p>Points of reference in the reports are widely spaced, so the exact route will likely differ from that shown <em>(right)</em>. What is clear, however, is that following a visit to El Calafate, the pair were arrested by airport security police as they arrived in Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz. They were later transferred to Córdoba.</p>
<p>Napolsky and Ermakova informed authorities they were on vacation in Argentina, enjoying the sights in a rented car. They’d done much the same in almost 100 countries previously, although without any serious issue. </p>
<p>In January 2023, Judge Miguel Hugo Vaca Narvaja authorized the Russians to be detained under house arrest. Approval from Córdoba prosecutor Maximiliano Hairabedian, who was responsible for the request to extradite Napolsky and Ermakova to the United States, was not obtained. </p>
<h2>Pair Fight Extradition to the United States</h2>
<p>With a <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-indicts-two-russians-for-running-the-z-library-piracy-ring221117/">federal indictment</a>, alleging criminal copyright infringement, wire fraud, and money laundering offenses, waiting for them in the United States, the priority for Napolsky and Ermakova would soon be their fight against extradition.</p>
<p>According to a November 2022 statement made by the Russian embassy in Argentina, no official extradition request was received in the immediate wake of the pair’s arrest. The embassy noted that “Argentina does not allow automatic execution of extraterritorial decisions and requests from third states.” Yet even after the request arrived, the process was far from straightforward.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/z-library-defendants-have-u-s-lawyers-now-but-questions-remain-230503/">retaining counsel</a>, the pair denied all wrongdoing. With diplomats from the Russian embassy in attendance, counsel for Napolsky argued that the extradition request failed on the basics by <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/alleged-z-library-operators-ask-court-to-dismiss-criminal-piracy-indictment-230713/">not specifying which copyrighted works</a> had allegedly been infringed, among other things.</p>
<p>That triggered a somewhat remarkable series of events.</p>
<h2>Judge Requested Additional Detail From U.S. Authorities</h2>
<p>Under pressure from the defense, Judge Sergio Pinto agreed to seek more information from U.S. authorities so that the defendants’ concerns about evidence could be addressed. However, the defense had other concerns too, including the impartiality of Judge Pinto, who had reportedly granted the United States a 30-day extension to correct defects in their extradition request.</p>
<p>According to local news publication <a href="https://www.lavoz.com.ar/sucesos/z-library-por-que-apartaron-al-juez-que-podia-extraditar-a-los-rusos-buscados-por-el-fbi-detenidos-en-cordoba/">La Voz</a>, the extension led to the defense accusing Judge Pinto of bias towards the United States. The defense said that a judge’s job is to judge and here, by granting an extension to the requesting state after closing the trial, the defense had no opportunity to participate in the process and suffered a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Defendants’ counsel called for Judge Pinto’s recusal and the Judge defended his position. Having reviewed the case, Judge Abel Sánchez Torres sided with the Russians and Judge Pinto was removed.</p>
<h2>New Judge Orders Extradition</h2>
<p>After replacing Judge Pinto, Judge Sánchez Freytes presided over the second extradition hearing. Based on the charges – criminal copyright infringement, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering – the Judge said that extradition to the United States was appropriate. </p>
<p>With Napolsky and Ermakova still under house arrest in Córdoba, an appeal to the Supreme Court of Justice sought political refugee status for the Russians. Success would mean the Russians could not be extradited to the United States. Meanwhile, another Russian was also seeking refugee status, this time to avoid extradition to Russia.</p>
<p>Oleg Andreevich Kulakov is considered an opponent of the Kremlin. According to a La Voz report, at the hearing previously attended by diplomats from the Russian embassy, Napolsky and Ermakova mentioned that Kulakov, wanted for fraud in Russia, is a neighbor of theirs. A decision on Kulakov’s extradition awaits a decision from the National Refugee Commission; Napolsky and Ermakova, on the other hand, appear to have decided that the time for waiting was over.</p>
<h2>Z-Library Defendants Vanish Into Thin Air</h2>
<p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/la-voz-z-lib.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/la-voz-z-lib.png" alt="la-voz-z-lib" width="300" height="309" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/la-voz-z-lib.png 836w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/la-voz-z-lib-300x309.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>Patronato del Liberado (Patronage of the Liberated) is responsible for assisting people who have previously been detained by the authorities with family and social reintegration. It’s also tasked with monitoring compliance of those on probation or subject to house arrest.</p>
<p>According to unnamed ‘judicial sources’ cited by La Voz, which receives <a href="https://www.lavoz.com.ar/sucesos/los-rusos-buscados-por-el-fbi-se-escaparon-de-la-prision-domiciliaria-en-cordoba/">full credit for a remarkable scoop</a>, when the group conducted a regular visit in May, to verify that Napolsky and Ermakova were in compliance with the rules set by the state, there was no trace of them.</p>
<p>Patronato del Liberado raised the alarm and Judge Sánchez Freytes was immediately notified. Counsel for the defense during the extradition hearings said that he hadn’t been able to contact the Russians either.</p>
<p>The Judge ordered an international arrest warrant although there appeared to be at least some hope the pair hadn’t left the country. However, that was many weeks ago and with no obvious news suggesting their recapture, the pair could be anywhere by now.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24188282/roku-tv-update-motion-smoothing-turn-off">https://www.theverge.com/24188282/roku-tv-update-motion-smoothing-turn-off</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40908444">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Roku has made my TV unusable.</p><p>On June 6th, my TCL TV’s Roku OS was updated to version 13.0.0. Ever since, on everything I watch, there is motion smoothing — a TV and film purists’ deepest nightmare. There is no way to turn it off.</p><p>In the updated OS, Roku added a feature called <em>Roku Smart Picture,</em> which, according to its <a href="https://support.roku.com/article/228844467">release notes</a>, “automatically improves picture quality dynamically as users stream.” While Roku doesn’t explicitly mention motion smoothing, or what Roku calls “<a href="https://support.roku.com/article/115007128487">action smoothing</a>,” the update has made it so that I and many <a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Discussions/Motion-Smoothing-out-of-nowhere/td-p/974654">others</a> with Roku TVs <em>see</em> motion smoothing, regardless of whether the picture setting is <em>Roku Smart Picture</em> or not. My TV didn’t even support motion smoothing before this. Now, I can’t make it go away.</p><p>If you’re someone who doesn’t notice motion smoothing or doesn’t particularly care about it, imagine if, suddenly, your ebook updated so all the fonts were three times as large. Or if your phone decided all video and audio would be played at 2x. Some folks might prefer that, but it should be a choice. Forcing a device to change how a user experiences content that is different than what is expected, with no means to revert or disable the change, is bad. That should be obvious.</p><p>Not long after the update rolled out, other Roku TV owners (mainly TCL, but Hisense, too) began posting about the issue in Roku’s community forum and on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/1ddywvp/tcl_has_action_smoothing_out_of_the_blue/">Reddit</a>. Since I work at <em>The Verge</em>, I told our team about my issue. We reached out to Roku for comment and got no response. We <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24177117/tcl-roku-tv-motion-smoothing-streaming">wrote about the problem</a>. Commenters on that post agreed: it sucks. Still, there was radio silence from Roku.</p><p>Shipping software can be challenging, especially if you’re shipping updates to a multitude of different devices. QA should catch issues, but sometimes they don’t, and a bug is shipped. It happens! So, in moments like these, it’s important to have strong customer support and to be responsive and communicative. What you probably should avoid is weeks of customers flagging the same issue with no meaningful feedback or updates. Possibly even more important, your support infrastructure shouldn’t be difficult to navigate or have their own bugs that hinder their use. In this case, there’s both.</p><p>Unlike my TV’s new picture setting, Roku’s customer support experience has been anything but smooth. I ran into technical issues sending a community moderator my information. The DM button was missing and then magically appeared the next day. Then, I couldn’t send a message, getting an error that my message contained invalid HTML (it did not). I was even told I had “reached the limit for number of private messages that you can send” even though I was never able to send a message to begin with. When I did finally get through, the response I got offered no solution —&nbsp;and barely made any sense.</p><p>This whole experience strikes me as something truly wild. If you’re in the business of making a product that plays movies and shows, you should be aware of how divisive a feature like motion smoothing is, as well as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/4/18126306/tom-cruise-psa-motion-smoothing-christopher-mcquarrie">how filmmakers feel about it</a>. If your slogan is “<a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.roku.com/about/content-policy">happy streaming</a>,” making streaming hell is a bad look.&nbsp;</p><p>With so many competing companies and products in the streaming world, brand loyalty is something every company should covet. Again, bugs happen! We all experience irritating technical issues with apps, sites, and devices. But usually, a brand wants to address those quickly to keep their customers feeling like they are a priority in fear of losing them to any of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-home/">many</a> <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://store.google.com/us/product/chromecast_google_tv?hl=en-US&amp;pli=1">other</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=8521791011&amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;hvadid=637498591906&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=10697276045594193518&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9190859&amp;hvtargid=kwd-77578224763&amp;ref=pd_sl_9ap9qk1y0l_e&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw-O6zBhASEiwAOHeGxf_I4SA7SgyoCMuFPNZLa5mpfYbUZpsFbfg5XwAKaJZtJsNA5V246BoC9i4QAvD_BwE&amp;tag=theverge02-20">similar</a> services out there.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s possible that, right now, a team is working on a fix. But I’m not holding out hope: it turns out that this isn’t the first time there’s been an issue with motion smoothing. In 2020, on the same Roku community forum, almost <a href="https://community.roku.com/t5/Discussions/Motion-Smoothing-Issues-on-new-TCL/td-p/554514">the exact same issue</a> happened to a different group of TCL TVs. The very last comment, posted by a user named DigitalFirefly in 2022, is short and bleak: “I’m still having this issue, I wish they would fix this already.” Me, too, DigitalFirefly. Me, too.</p><p>Roku didn’t respond to requests for comment at the time of publish, but we will update this article with any responses we receive.</p><p>So, I’m not holding out hope that this will be resolved soon. Because it wasn’t in 2020, and it hasn’t in the last three weeks. Instead, I’m in the market for a new TV, maybe a dumb one that I will never have to connect to the internet. So if you have any recommendations, please share them in the comments.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Design software developer Serif has launched a new six-month free trial for its Affinity creative suite, which is well regarded as being one of the few viable alternatives to Adobe’s professional design apps. <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/press/newsroom/try-affinity-designer-photo-and-publisher-free-for-six-months/">The offer</a> is available for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23448945/affinity-version-2-adobe-creative-app-features-price">Affinity Photo, Affinity Designer, and Affinity Publisher</a> starting today on Mac, Windows PC, and iPad.</p><p>Affinity uses a one-time purchase pricing model that has earned it a loyal fanbase among creatives who are sick of paying for recurring subscriptions. <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/affinity-pricing/">Prices start at $69.99</a> for Affinity’s individual desktop apps or $164.99 for the entire suite, with a separate deal currently offering customers 50 percent off all perpetual licenses. </p><p>This discount, alongside the six-month free trial, is potentially geared at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/27/24113423/affinity-canva-acquisition-pledge-license-price-subscription">soothing concerns</a> that Affinity would change its pricing model after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/26/24112277/canva-affinity-acquisition-design-software-suite-adobe-rival">being acquired by Canva earlier this year</a>. “We’re saying ‘try everything and pay nothing’ because we understand making a change can be a big step, particularly for busy professionals,” said Affinity CEO Ashley Hewson. “Anyone who takes the trial is under absolutely no obligation to buy.”</p><p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24191080/canva-ceo-melanie-perkins-design-ai-adobe-competition-decoder-podcast-interview"><em>Decoder </em>interview published today, Canva CEO Melanie Perkins</a>&nbsp;declined to describe its offering as a full alternative to Adobe’s Creative Cloud.

                <section>
                    <p>We are working on a new scheme to replace the GRUB bootloader with a fast, secure, Linux-based, user-space solution: nmbl (for no more boot loader).<br>
Most people are familiar with GRUB, a powerful, flexible, fully-featured bootloader that is used on multiple architectures (x86_64, aarch64, ppc64le OpenFirmware). Although GRUB is quite versatile and capable, its features create complexity that is difficult to maintain, and that both duplicate and lag behind the Linux kernel while also creating numerous security holes. On the other hand, the Linux kernel, which has a large developer base, benefits from fast feature development, quick responses to vulnerabilities and greater overall scrutiny.<br>
We (Red Hat boot loader engineering) will present our solution to this problem, which is to use the Linux kernel as its own bootloader. Loaded by the EFI stub on UEFI, and packed into a unified kernel image (UKI), the kernel, initramfs, and kernel command line, contain everything they need to reach the final boot target. All necessary drivers, filesystem support, and networking are already built in and code duplication is avoided. <br>
We will showcase the work done so far, and ask you for your feedback and use cases.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/07/08/readline/">https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/07/08/readline/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40907581">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>The other day I asked what folks on Mastodon find confusing about working in
the terminal, and one thing that stood out to me was “editing a command you
already typed in”.</p>

<p>This really resonated with me: even though entering some text and editing it is
a very “basic” task, it took me maybe 15 years of using the terminal every
single day to get used to using <code>Ctrl+A</code> to go to the beginning of the line (or
<code>Ctrl+E</code> for the end).</p>

<p>So let’s talk about why entering text might be hard! I’ll also share a few tips
that I wish I’d learned earlier.</p>

<h3 id="it-s-very-inconsistent-between-programs">it’s very inconsistent between programs</h3>

<p>A big part of what makes entering text in the terminal hard is the
inconsistency between how different programs handle entering text. For example:</p>

<ol>
<li>some programs (the <code>dash</code> shell, <code>cat</code>, <code>nc</code>, <code>git commit --interactive</code>, etc) don’t support using arrow keys at all: if you press arrow keys, you’ll just see <code>^[[D^[[D^[[C^[[C^</code></li>
<li>many programs (like <code>irb</code>, <code>python3</code> on a Linux machine and many many more) use the <code>readline</code> library, which gives you a lot of basic functionality (history, arrow keys, etc)</li>
<li>some programs (like <code>/usr/bin/python3</code> on my Mac) do support very basic features like arrow keys, but not other features like <code>Ctrl+left</code> or reverse searching with <code>Ctrl+R</code></li>
<li>some programs (like the <code>fish</code> shell or <code>ipython3</code> or <code>micro</code> or <code>vim</code>) have their own fancy system for accepting input which is totally custom</li>
</ol>

<p>So there’s a lot of variation! Let’s talk about each of those a little more.</p>

<h3 id="mode-1-the-baseline">mode 1: the baseline</h3>

<p>First, there’s “the baseline” – what happens if a program just accepts text by
calling <code>fgets()</code> or whatever and doing absolutely nothing else to provide a
nicer experience. Here’s what using these tools typically looks for me – If I
start <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dash">dash</a> (a pretty minimal shell) press the left arrow keys, it just prints
<code>^[[D</code> to the terminal.</p>

<pre><code>$ ls l-^[[D^[[D^[[D
</code></pre>

<p>At first it doesn’t seem like all of these “baseline” tools have much in
common, but there are actually a few features that you get for free just from
your terminal, without the program needing to do anything special at all.</p>

<p>The things you get for free are:</p>

<ol>
<li>typing in text, obviously</li>
<li>backspace</li>
<li><code>Ctrl+W</code>, to delete the previous word</li>
<li><code>Ctrl+U</code>, to delete the whole line</li>
<li>a few other things unrelated to text editing (like <code>Ctrl+C</code> to interrupt the process, <code>Ctrl+Z</code> to suspend, etc)</li>
</ol>

<p>This is not <em>great</em>, but it means that if you want to delete a word you
generally can do it with <code>Ctrl+W</code> instead of pressing backspace 15 times, even
if you’re in an environment which is offering you absolutely zero features.</p>

<p>You can get a list of all the ctrl codes that your terminal supports with <code>stty -a</code>.</p>

<h3 id="mode-2-tools-that-use-readline">mode 2: tools that use <code>readline</code></h3>

<p>The next group is tools that use readline! Readline is a GNU library to make
entering text more pleasant, and it’s very widely used.</p>

<p>My favourite readline keyboard shortcuts are:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>Ctrl+E</code> to go to the end of the line</li>
<li><code>Ctrl+A</code> to go to the beginning of the line</li>
<li><code>Ctrl+left/right arrow</code> to go back/forward 1 word</li>
<li>up arrow to go back to the previous command</li>
<li><code>Ctrl+R</code> to search your history</li>
</ol>

<p>And you can use <code>Ctrl+W</code> / <code>Ctrl+U</code> from the “baseline” list, though <code>Ctrl+U</code>
deletes from the cursor to the beginning of the line instead of deleting the
whole line. I think <code>Ctrl+W</code> might also have a slightly different definition of
what a “word” is.</p>

<p>There are a lot more (<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/readline.3.html#EDITING_COMMANDS">here’s a full list</a>), but those are the only ones that I personally use.</p>

<p>The <code>bash</code> shell is probably the most famous readline user (when you use
<code>Ctrl+R</code> to search your history in bash, that feature actually comes from
readline), but there are TONS of programs that use it – for example <code>psql</code>,
<code>irb</code>, <code>python3</code>, etc.</p>

<h3 id="tip-you-can-make-anything-use-readline-with-rlwrap">tip: you can make ANYTHING use readline with <code>rlwrap</code></h3>

<p>One of my absolute favourite things is that if you have a program like <code>nc</code>
without readline support, you can just run <code>rlwrap nc</code> to turn it into a
program with readline support!</p>

<p>This is incredible and makes a lot of tools that are borderline unusable MUCH
more pleasant to use. You can even apparently set up <a href="https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap">rlwrap</a> to include your own
custom autocompletions, though I’ve never tried that.</p>

<h3 id="some-reasons-tools-might-not-use-readline">some reasons tools might not use readline</h3>

<p>I think reasons tools might not use readline might include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the program is very simple (like <code>cat</code> or <code>nc</code>) and maybe the maintainers don’t want to bring in a relatively large dependency</li>
<li>license reasons, if the program’s license is not GPL-compatible – readline is GPL-licensed, not LGPL</li>
<li>only a very small part of the program is interactive, and maybe readline
support isn’t seen as important. For example <code>git</code> has a few interactive
features (like <code>git add -p</code>), but not very many, and usually you’re just
typing a single character like <code>y</code> or <code>n</code> – most of the time you need to really
type something significant in git, it’ll drop you into a text editor instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example idris2 says <a href="https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/interactive.html#editing-at-the-repl">they don’t use readline</a>
to keep dependencies minimal and suggest using <code>rlwrap</code> to get better
interactive features.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-know-if-you-re-using-readline">how to know if you’re using readline</h3>

<p>The simplest test I can think of is to press <code>Ctrl+R</code>, and if you see:</p>

<pre><code>(reverse-i-search)`':
</code></pre>

<p>then you’re probably using readline. This obviously isn’t a guarantee (some
other library could use the term <code>reverse-i-search</code> too!), but I don’t know of
another system that uses that specific term to refer to searching history.</p>

<h3 id="the-readline-keybindings-come-from-emacs">the readline keybindings come from Emacs</h3>

<p>Because I’m a vim user, It took me a very long time to understand where these
keybindings come from (why <code>Ctrl+A</code> to go to the beginning of a line??? so
weird!)</p>

<p>My understanding is these keybindings actually come from Emacs – <code>Ctrl+A</code> and
<code>Ctrl+E</code> do the same thing in Emacs as they do in Readline and I assume the
other keyboard shortcuts mostly do as well, though I tried out <code>Ctrl+W</code> and
<code>Ctrl+U</code> in Emacs and they don’t do the same thing as they do in the terminal
so I guess there are some differences.</p>

<p>There’s some more <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2019/08/22/readline.html">history of the Readline project here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="mode-3-another-input-library-like-libedit">mode 3: another input library (like <code>libedit</code>)</h3>

<p>On my Mac laptop, <code>/usr/bin/python3</code> is in a weird middle ground where it
supports <em>some</em> readline features (for example the arrow keys), but not the
other ones. For example when I press <code>Ctrl+left arrow</code>, it prints out <code>;5D</code>,
like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ python3
&gt;&gt;&gt; importt subprocess;5D
</code></pre>

<p>Folks on Mastodon helped me figure out that this is because in the default
Python install on Mac OS, the Python <code>readline</code> module is actually backed by
<code>libedit</code>, which is a similar library which has fewer features, presumably
because Readline is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Readline#Choice_of_the_GPL_as_GNU_Readline's_license">GPL licensed</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s how I was eventually able to figure out that Python was using libedit on
my system:</p>

<pre><code>$ python3 -c "import readline; print(readline.__doc__)"
Importing this module enables command line editing using libedit readline.
</code></pre>

<p>Generally Python uses readline though if you install it on Linux or through
Homebrew. It’s just that the specific version that Apple includes on their
systems doesn’t have readline. Also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#a-better-interactive-interpreter">Python 3.13 is going to remove the readline dependency</a>
in favour of a custom library, so “Python uses readline” won’t be true in the
future.</p>

<p>I assume that there are more programs on my Mac that use libedit but I haven’t
looked into it.</p>

<h3 id="mode-4-something-custom">mode 4: something custom</h3>

<p>The last group of programs is programs that have their own custom (and sometimes
much fancier!) system for editing text. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>most terminal text editors (nano, micro, vim, emacs, etc)</li>
<li>some shells (like fish), for example it seems like fish supports <code>Ctrl+Z</code> for undo when typing in a command. Zsh’s line editor is called <a href="https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Guide/zshguide04.html">zle</a>.</li>
<li>some REPLs (like <code>ipython</code>), for example IPython uses the <a href="https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/">prompt_toolkit</a> library instead of readline</li>
<li>lots of other programs (like <code>atuin</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some features you might see are:</p>

<ul>
<li>better autocomplete which is more customized to the tool</li>
<li>nicer history management (for example with syntax highlighting) than the default you get from readline</li>
<li>more keyboard shortcuts</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="custom-input-systems-are-often-readline-inspired">custom input systems are often readline-inspired</h3>

<p>I went looking at how <a href="https://atuin.sh/">Atuin</a> (a wonderful tool for
searching your shell history that I started using recently) handles text input.
Looking at <a href="https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin/blob/a67cfc82fe0dc907a01f07a0fd625701e062a33b/crates/atuin/src/command/client/search/interactive.rs#L382-L430">the code</a>
and some of the discussion around it, their implementation is custom but it’s
inspired by readline, which makes sense to me – a lot of users are used to
those keybindings, and it’s convenient for them to work even though atuin
doesn’t use readline.</p>

<p><a href="https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/">prompt_toolkit</a> (the library
IPython uses) is similar – it actually supports a lot of options (including
vi-like keybindings), but the default is to support the readline-style
keybindings.</p>

<p>This is like how you see a lot of programs which support very basic vim
keybindings (like <code>j</code> for down and <code>k</code> for up). For example Fastmail supports
<code>j</code> and <code>k</code> even though most of its other keybindings don’t have much
relationship to vim.</p>

<p>I assume that most “readline-inspired” custom input systems have various subtle
incompatibilities with readline, but this doesn’t really bother me at all
personally because I’m extremely ignorant of most of readline’s features. I only use
maybe 5 keyboard shortcuts, so as long as they support the 5 basic commands I
know (which they always do!) I feel pretty comfortable. And usually these
custom systems have much better autocomplete than you’d get from just using
readline, so generally I prefer them over readline.</p>

<h3 id="lots-of-shells-support-vi-keybindings">lots of shells support vi keybindings</h3>

<p>Bash, zsh, and fish all have a “vi mode” for entering text. In a
<a href="https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk/112723846172173621">very unscientific poll</a> I ran on
Mastodon, 12% of people said they use it, so it seems pretty popular.</p>

<p>Readline also has a “vi mode” (which is how Bash’s support for it works), so by
extension lots of other programs have it too.</p>

<p>I’ve always thought that vi mode seems really cool, but for some reason even
though I’m a vim user it’s never stuck for me.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-what-situation-you-re-in-really-helps">understanding what situation you’re in really helps</h3>

<p>I’ve spent a lot of my life being confused about why a command line application
I was using wasn’t behaving the way I wanted, and it feels good to be able to
more or less understand what’s going on.</p>

<p>I think this is roughly my mental flowchart when I’m entering text at a command
line prompt:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do the arrow keys not work? Probably there’s no input system at all, but at
least I can use <code>Ctrl+W</code> and <code>Ctrl+U</code>, and I can <code>rlwrap</code> the tool if I
want more features.</li>
<li>Does <code>Ctrl+R</code> print <code>reverse-i-search</code>? Probably it’s readline, so I can use
all of the readline shortcuts I’m used to, and I know I can get some basic
history and press up arrow to get the previous command.</li>
<li>Does <code>Ctrl+R</code> do something else? This is probably some custom input library:
it’ll probably act more or less like readline, and I can check the
documentation if I really want to know how it works.</li>
</ol>

<p>Being able to diagnose what’s going on like this makes the command line feel a
more predictable and less chaotic.</p>

<h3 id="some-things-this-post-left-out">some things this post left out</h3>

<p>There are lots more complications related to entering text that we didn’t talk
about at all here, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>issues related to ssh / tmux / etc</li>
<li>the <code>TERM</code> environment variable</li>
<li>how different terminals (gnome terminal, iTerm, xterm, etc) have different kinds of support for copying/pasting text</li>
<li>unicode</li>
<li>probably a lot more</li>
</ul>

New ideas often don't work
at first, but they're not deterred. They keep trying and eventually
find something that does.</p><p>Mere obstinacy, on the other hand, is a recipe for failure. Obstinate
people are so annoying. They won't listen. They beat their heads
against a wall and get nowhere.</p><p>But is there any real difference between these two cases? Are
persistent and obstinate people actually behaving differently? Or
are they doing the same thing, and we just label them later as
persistent or obstinate depending on whether they turned out to be
right or not?</p><p>If that's the only difference then there's nothing to be learned
from the distinction. Telling someone to be persistent rather than
obstinate would just be telling them to be right rather than wrong,
and they already know that. Whereas if persistence and obstinacy
are actually different kinds of behavior, it would be worthwhile
to tease them apart.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><span color="#dddddd">1</span></a>]</span><p>I've talked to a lot of determined people, and it seems to me that
they're different kinds of behavior. I've often walked away from a
conversation thinking either "Wow, that guy is determined" or "Damn,
that guy is stubborn," and I don't think I'm just talking about
whether they seemed right or not. That's part of it, but not all
of it.</p><p>There's something annoying about the obstinate that's not simply
due to being mistaken. They won't listen. And that's not true of
all determined people. I can't think of anyone more determined than
the Collison brothers, and when you point out a problem to them,
they not only listen, but listen with an almost predatory intensity.
Is there a hole in the bottom of their boat? Probably not, but if
there is, they want to know about it.</p><p>It's the same with most successful people. They're never <i>more</i>
engaged than when you disagree with them. Whereas the obstinate
don't want to hear you. When you point out problems, their eyes
glaze over, and their replies sound like ideologues talking about
matters of doctrine.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><span color="#dddddd">2</span></a>]</span><p>The reason the persistent and the obstinate seem similar is that
they're both hard to stop. But they're hard to stop in different
senses. The persistent are like boats whose engines can't be throttled
back. The obstinate are like boats whose rudders can't be turned.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><span color="#dddddd">3</span></a>]</span><p>In the degenerate case they're indistinguishable: when there's only
one way to solve a problem, your only choice is whether to give up
or not, and persistence and obstinacy both say no. This is presumably
why the two are so often conflated in popular culture. It assumes
simple problems. But as problems get more complicated, we can see
the difference between them. The persistent are much more attached
to points high in the decision tree than to minor ones lower down,
while the obstinate spray "don't give up" indiscriminately over the
whole tree.</p><p>The persistent are attached to the goal. The obstinate are attached
to their ideas about how to reach it.</p><p>Worse still, that means they'll tend to be attached to their <i>first</i>
ideas about how to solve a problem, even though these are the least
informed by the experience of working on it. So the obstinate aren't
merely attached to details, but disproportionately likely to be
attached to wrong ones.</p><p>Why are they like this? Why are the obstinate obstinate? One
possibility is that they're overwhelmed. They're not very capable.
They take on a hard problem. They're immediately in over their head.
So they grab onto ideas the way someone on the deck of a rolling
ship might grab onto the nearest handhold.</p><p>That was my initial theory, but on examination it doesn't hold up.
If being obstinate were simply a consequence of being in over one's
head, you could make persistent people become obstinate by making
them solve harder problems. But that's not what happens. If you
handed the Collisons an extremely hard problem to solve, they
wouldn't become obstinate. If anything they'd become less obstinate.
They'd know they had to be open to anything.</p><p>Similarly, if obstinacy were caused by the situation, the obstinate
would stop being obstinate when solving easier problems. But they
don't. And if obstinacy isn't caused by the situation, it must come
from within. It must be a feature of one's personality.</p><p>Obstinacy is a reflexive resistance to changing one's ideas. This
is not identical with stupidity, but they're closely related. A
reflexive resistance to changing one's ideas becomes a sort of
induced stupidity as contrary evidence mounts. And obstinacy is a
form of not giving up that's easily practiced by the stupid. You
don't have to consider complicated tradeoffs; you just dig in your
heels. It even works, up to a point.</p><p>The fact that obstinacy works for simple problems is an important
clue. Persistence and obstinacy aren't opposites. The relationship
between them is more like the relationship between the two kinds
of respiration we can do: aerobic respiration, and the anaerobic
respiration we inherited from our most distant ancestors. Anaerobic
respiration is a more primitive process, but it has its uses. When
you leap suddenly away from a threat, that's what you're using.</p><p>The optimal amount of obstinacy is not zero. It can be good if your
initial reaction to a setback is an unthinking "I won't give up,"
because this helps prevent panic. But unthinking only gets you so
far. The further someone is toward the obstinate end of the continuum,
the less likely they are to succeed in solving hard problems.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f4n"><span color="#dddddd">4</span></a>]</span><p>Obstinacy is a simple thing. Animals have it. But persistence turns
out to have a fairly complicated internal structure.</p><p>One thing that distinguishes the persistent is their energy. At the
risk of putting too much weight on words, they persist rather than
merely resisting. They keep trying things. Which means the persistent
must also be imaginative. To keep trying things, you have to keep
thinking of things to try.</p><p>Energy and imagination make a wonderful combination. Each gets the
best out of the other. Energy creates demand for the ideas produced
by imagination, which thus produces more, and imagination gives
energy somewhere to go.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f5n"><span color="#dddddd">5</span></a>]</span><p>Merely having energy and imagination is quite rare. But to solve
hard problems you need three more qualities: resilience, good
judgement, and a focus on some kind of goal.</p><p>Resilience means not having one's morale destroyed by setbacks.
Setbacks are inevitable once problems reach a certain size, so if
you can't bounce back from them, you can only do good work on a
small scale. But resilience is not the same as obstinacy. Resilience
means setbacks can't change your morale, not that they can't change
your mind.</p><p>Indeed, persistence often requires that one change one's mind.
That's where good judgement comes in. The persistent are quite
rational. They focus on expected value. It's this, not recklessness,
that lets them work on things that are unlikely to succeed.</p><p>There is one point at which the persistent are often irrational
though: at the very top of the decision tree. When they choose
between two problems of roughly equal expected value, the choice
usually comes down to personal preference. Indeed, they'll often
classify projects into deliberately wide bands of expected value
in order to ensure that the one they want to work on still qualifies.</p><p>Empirically this doesn't seem to be a problem. It's ok to be
irrational near the top of the decision tree. One reason is that
we humans will work harder on a problem we love. But there's another
more subtle factor involved as well: our preferences among problems
aren't random. When we love a problem that other people don't, it's
often because we've unconsciously noticed that it's more important
than they realize.</p><p>Which leads to our fifth quality: there needs to be some overall
goal. If you're like me you began, as a kid, merely with the desire
to do something great. In theory that should be the most powerful
motivator of all, since it includes everything that could possibly
be done. But in practice it's not much use, precisely because it
includes too much. It doesn't tell you what to do at this moment.</p><p>So in practice your energy and imagination and resilience and good
judgement have to be directed toward some fairly specific goal. Not
too specific, or you might miss a great discovery adjacent to what
you're searching for, but not too general, or it won't work to
motivate you.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f6n"><span color="#dddddd">6</span></a>]</span><p>When you look at the internal structure of persistence, it doesn't
resemble obstinacy at all. It's so much more complex. Five distinct
qualities — energy, imagination, resilience, good judgement, and
focus on a goal — combine to produce a phenomenon that seems a bit
like obstinacy in the sense that it causes you not to give up. But
the way you don't give up is completely different. Instead of merely
resisting change, you're driven toward a goal by energy and resilience,
through paths discovered by imagination and optimized by judgement.
You'll give way on any point low down in the decision tree, if its
expected value drops sufficiently, but energy and resilience keep
pushing you toward whatever you chose higher up.</p><p>Considering what it's made of, it's not surprising that the right
kind of stubbornness is so much rarer than the wrong kind, or that
it gets so much better results. Anyone can do obstinacy. Indeed,
kids and drunks and fools are best at it. Whereas very few people
have enough of all five of the qualities that produce right kind
of stubbornness, but when they do the results are magical.</p><p>
<b>Notes</b></p><p>[</p><a name="f1n"><span color="#000000">1</span></a>]
I'm going to use "persistent" for the good kind of stubborn
and "obstinate" for the bad kind, but I can't claim I'm simply
following current usage. Conventional opinion barely distinguishes
between good and bad kinds of stubbornness, and usage is correspondingly
promiscuous. I could have invented a new word for the good kind,
but it seemed better just to stretch "persistent."<p>[</p><a name="f2n"><span color="#000000">2</span></a>]
There are some domains where one can succeed by being obstinate.
Some political leaders have been notorious for it. But it won't
work in situations where you have to pass external tests. And indeed
the political leaders who are famous for being obstinate are famous
for getting power, not for using it well.<p>[</p><a name="f3n"><span color="#000000">3</span></a>]
There will be some resistance to turning the rudder of a
persistent person, because there's some cost to changing direction.<p>[</p><a name="f4n"><span color="#000000">4</span></a>]
The obstinate do sometimes succeed in solving hard problems.
One way is through luck: like the stopped clock that's right twice
a day, they seize onto some arbitrary idea, and it turns out to be
right. Another is when their obstinacy cancels out some other form
of error. For example, if a leader has overcautious subordinates,
their estimates of the probability of success will always be off
in the same direction. So if he mindlessly says "push ahead regardless"
in every borderline case, he'll usually turn out to be right.<p>[</p><a name="f5n"><span color="#000000">5</span></a>]
If you stop there, at just energy and imagination, you get
the conventional caricature of an artist or poet.<p>[</p><a name="f6n"><span color="#000000">6</span></a>]
Start by erring on the small side. If you're inexperienced
you'll inevitably err on one side or the other, and if you err on
the side of making the goal too broad, you won't get anywhere.
Whereas if you err on the small side you'll at least be moving
forward. Then, once you're moving, you expand the goal.<span color="888888"><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell,

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>“Screenshots won’t get you in”, but Chrome DevTools will.</em></p>
<p><a href="#Reverse-Engineering">Click here to skip the rant and go straight to the nerdy stuff.</a></p>
<p>I recently purchased tickets to a concert from TicketMaster. If they had issued me normal, printable PDF tickets I could save offline to my phone, this article would’ve never been penned. But of course this is 2024: Nothing we do online can be simple anymore.</p>
<p>After finalizing the purchase, TicketMaster discloses that I can’t print off tickets for this event. Instead, they issue tickets via a system called Mobile Entry, AKA <em>SafeTix.</em> This takes the form of a rotating barcode displayed inside TicketMaster’s web-app or android/ios app.</p>
<p><img src="https://conduition.io/images/ticketmaster/safetix-barcode.gif"></p><p>Perhaps I’m getting old, but I remember a time when printable tickets were ubiquitous. One could print off tickets after buying them online or even (gasp) <em>in-person,</em> and bring these paper tickets to get entry into the event when you arrive. They can be saved as PDFs and viewed on pretty much any device on the planet. PDF tickets work even if your phone loses internet connection. Paper tickets work even if you don’t have a phone. If you bought the ticket off the event’s official ticketing agency (not a sketchy reseller), you know for sure that they’re real. There’s no risk that your ticket won’t get you in. You can easily send them to a friend over WhatsApp, iMessage, Signal, email, or even by-hand with printed tickets.</p>
<p>These rotating barcodes on the other hand are far from perfect. I experienced this first-hand last year when I attended another <em>very popular</em> concert where they used a similar rotating-QR-code-ticket system. Numerous people including myself and my friends were floundering at the entry gate citing a bevy of broken barcode problems. The #1 was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My phone has no internet connection, so my QR code won’t load.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The venue was so crowded that cell-towers and WiFi were overloaded. Internet access was spottier than a Dalmatian with chickenpox.</p>
<p>The company responsible for this ticketing nightmare (I can’t remember their name) obviously had no phone support line, and even if they did it probably wouldn’t have worked. The venue employees were completely helpless. Our only hope was to keep refreshing the ticket app, wildly waving our phones in the air in the hopes we might catch a brief moment of cell-network coverage with which to fetch and then display the ticket QR codes to the venue staff.</p>
<p>In the end, I luckily caught some cell-service and loaded our ticket QR codes. We left behind a slew of other ticketholders waving their phones around at the gate. I have no idea whether they ever got through.</p>
<p>I paid three hundred US dollars for this high-tech experience.</p>
<h2 id="The-Marketing"><a href="#The-Marketing" title="The Marketing"></a>The Marketing</h2><p>TicketMaster markets their SafeTix technology as a cure-all for scammers and scalpers.</p>

<p>Bullshit, TicketMaster. It’s a CSS animation. Get over yourself.</p>
<p>The part that got me worried:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The barcode on your mobile ticket includes technology to protect it, which means screenshots or printouts of your ticket will not be scannable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This triggered flashbacks to the concert last year, and I pictured myself once more haphazardly waving my phone around, praying for service like Saul Goodman in the desert.</p>
<p><img src="https://conduition.io/images/ticketmaster/saul-goodman-1.webp">
  <img src="https://conduition.io/images/ticketmaster/saul-goodman-2.webp">
</p>

<p>But TicketMaster was prepared for this anxiety:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Concerned about cell phone service at venues? This ticket has you covered. Once you view it in our App, your ticket is automatically saved so it’s always ready.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great, so as long as I trust their app not to have a seizure on the day of the concert, I should be fine. Too bad I really don’t trust that, besides the fact that I don’t want to install their spyware on my phone.</p>
<h2 id="Motivations"><a href="#Motivations" title="Motivations"></a>Motivations</h2><p>It’s pretty clear why TicketMaster is pushing this technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>SafeTix makes it harder for people to resell tickets outside of TicketMaster’s closed, high-margin ticket-resale marketplace, where they make a boatload of money by buying low and selling high to customers with no alternative.</li>
<li>It pushes users to install TicketMaster’s proprietary closed-source app, which gives TicketMaster more insight into their users’ devices and behavior.</li>
<li>People can’t save and transfer tickets outside of Ticketmaster. This forces ticketholders to surrender their friends’ contact information to TicketMaster, who can use this data to build social graphs, or conduct other privacy-invasive practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>TicketMaster will never admit to these motivations, but it cannot be doubted that these effects have manifested regardless of TicketMaster’s intent, and they’re all good news for TicketMaster’s shareholders, if not for their customers.</p>
<h2 id="The-Contradiction"><a href="#The-Contradiction" title="The Contradiction"></a>The Contradiction</h2><p>If you have any experience with computers and software, then having read all of TicketMaster’s marketing, you might come to the same question I did.</p>
<p><strong>How can tickets be saved offline if they can’t also be transferred outside of TicketMaster?</strong></p>
<p>This ticket is digital. Saving data offline is the same as copying it to your hard drive. If data can be copied, it can be transmitted. If it can be transmitted, it can be shared. If it can be shared, <em>it can be sold.</em></p>
<p>This is a contradiction in TicketMaster’s marketing. They can’t have robust DRM on their tickets if those tickets can still be viewed offline.</p>
<p>So what is TicketMaster really doing to create these rotating barcodes?</p>
<h2 id="Reverse-Engineering"><a href="#Reverse-Engineering" title="Reverse Engineering"></a>Reverse Engineering</h2><p>My first order of business was inspecting the barcodes themselves to see what I could learn. Their format is quite simple. They are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF417">PDF417</a> barcodes which encode <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8 text</a>. As I mentioned earlier, that blue bar which sweeps across the barcode is just a gimmicky <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp">CSS animation</a>: It doesn’t actually prevent screenshots of the barcode from scanning, because PDF417 has error correction properties built-in.</p>
<p>It seems like some older barcodes encode different formats of text, but the barcodes my TicketMaster web-app was generating embed data which looks like this:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>B4cq2BdFCpFl90TDuYD3pWfRDSO6eQ3bR0YQqsDnyfciuVFkKp+m0zI+a2lgfonY::140013::481994::1707070843</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p><sub>Disclaimer: This isn’t from a real SafeTix barcode. I don’t want TicketMaster to be able to identify and harass me.</sub></p>
<p>This looks like four distinct pieces of data, delimited by colons. First, there is some <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a>-encoded data, followed by two six-digit numbers, with a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">unix timestamp</a> trailing at the end.</p>
<p>When the barcode rotates every 15 seconds, its content changes slightly. The base64 data remains static, but both 6-digit numbers and the timestamp change.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>B4cq2BdFCpFl90TDuYD3pWfRDSO6eQ3bR0YQqsDnyfciuVFkKp+m0zI+a2lgfonY::358190::038184::1707070859</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>These six-digit numbers behave a lot like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-Time_Password">Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTPs)</a> - This is what powers 2FA apps like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2">Google Authenticator</a>. These are rotating 6-digit codes which can be generated from a shared secret and a timestamp.</p>
<p>My instinct was that the first two numbers are indeed TOTPs, generated from different secrets, using the unix timestamp appended at the end of the barcode data. This makes sense: TicketMaster wouldn’t want to reinvent the wheel with this system, so they used a tried and tested cryptographic tool as a building block.</p>
<p>The base64 data was still a mystery. Decoding it into its constituent 48 bytes, it doesn’t seem to contain any meaningful data structures that I could discern. It seems more or less like random data, and since it doesn’t change when the barcode rotates, it’s probably some kind of random bearer token which identifies the ticketholder and their ticket.</p>
<p>When the ticket is scanned at the venue, TicketMaster (or perhaps the venue) looks up the ticket metadata using that bearer token, and then validates the two OTPs against two secrets stored in its database. If both steps pass, then your ticket is valid and the staff can let you in.</p>
<h2 id="Here’s-the-Secret"><a href="#Here’s-the-Secret" title="Here’s the Secret"></a>Here’s the Secret</h2><p>TOTPs are very customizable, but generally the software industry has settled on a set of common defaults for TOTP standardization. You really only need to have two things to generate a TOTP:</p>
<ul>
<li>The shared secret, which is just a byte array.</li>
<li>A working clock.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have both of those, you can generate as many TOTPs as you’d like, <em>entirely offline.</em></p>
<p>There are two TOTPs in the barcode data, so there are probably two shared secrets I need to find. If I have both of those, plus the bearer token, I can create as many valid barcodes as I want.</p>
<p>So now my goal is much clearer: I need to find out where these tokens &amp; secrets come from.</p>
<h2 id="Debugging-the-Web-App"><a href="#Debugging-the-Web-App" title="Debugging the Web App"></a>Debugging the Web App</h2><p>I booted up an Android phone and connected its Chrome browser to the Chrome DevTools on my desktop computer. This gives me a view into TicketMaster’s API and source code.</p>

<p>Nice. So <code>t</code> is the static bearer token. I wonder if <code>ck</code> and <code>ek</code> are the TOTP secrets I’m after.</p>

<p>The minification makes it a bit harder to read, but it seems like <code>ek</code> and <code>ck</code> probably refer to the <code>eventKey</code> and <code>customerKey</code> respectively, while the bearer token <code>t</code> is referenced as <code>rawToken</code> in the above code.</p>
<p>It appears the two TOTPs are generated with a 15-second time step interval, but are otherwise constructed in the same way as the ubiquitous industry-standard SHA-1 TOTPs we see in any mobile 2FA app. The first one is generated with the <code>eventKey</code>, and the second with the <code>customerKey</code>. Finally, the unix timestamp used for both TOTPs is appended to help with verification on the server-side.</p>
<p>To verify my interpretation, I installed <code>oathtool</code>, a TOTP command-line tool. I plugged <code>ck</code>, <code>ek</code> and the unix timestamp into a SHA-1 TOTP generator with a 15-second step interval:</p>

<p>The <code>eventKey</code> is probably unique to the particular event that is being ticketed, and <code>customerKey</code> is probably unique to the ticketholder. They don’t appear to change at all, unlike the <code>rawToken</code> which seems to rotate every time I refresh the TicketMaster web-app. However, if I leave the page alone for several hours, the <code>rawToken</code> doesn’t change, suggesting it should remain valid even after closing the web-app.</p>
<p><sub>What about the <code>passData.android.jwt</code> field? Does that come into play anywhere? I’ll save you some work on that front. Turns out it’s not actually needed for ticket verification at all, but rather just an authentication token used for saving the ticket to a user’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://wallet.google/">Google Wallet</a>. I don’t use Google Wallet. Being a rather privacy-conscious individual, I stay well clear of Google services as much as possible.</sub></p>
<h2 id="Pirating-Tickets"><a href="#Pirating-Tickets" title="Pirating Tickets"></a>Pirating Tickets</h2><p>I now know everything I would need to duplicate TicketMaster’s barcodes in a custom app, or even resell a ticket outside of TicketMaster’s closed marketplace. All I would need to do is extract the base64 <code>token</code> property from the <code>/api/render-ticket/secure-barcode</code> API endpoint, or engineer a way to fetch that token dynamically using TicketMaster session credentials.</p>
<p>That base64 <code>token</code> string <em><strong>IS</strong></em> the ticket, as far as the venue staff at the gates are concerned. If you have a valid <code>rawToken</code>, <code>eventKey</code>, and <code>customerKey</code>, you can generate valid <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF417">PDF417 barcodes</a>, indistinguishable from the official TicketMaster app. Short of checking photo IDs at the entry gate, the venue staff can’t tell whether the person at the gate is the same person who the ticket is registered to on TicketMaster.</p>
<p>Quite hilariously, TicketMaster actually makes token-extraction easy on us: The <code>token</code> is logged to the browser console automatically when the barcode renderer component is mounted on the web page.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>r.<span>a</span>.<span>log</span>(</span><br><span>  <span>"'render' called on '"</span>.<span>concat</span>(</span><br><span>    <span>"pseview-"</span>.<span>concat</span>(J.<span>get</span>(<span>this</span>)),</span><br><span>    <span>"' with token '"</span>, <span>this</span>.<span>token</span>, <span>"'"</span></span><br><span>  )</span><br><span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>This means we don’t even need to mess around injecting custom user-scripts into the page to get the <code>token</code> out. You can just open your SafeTix barcode on the TicketMaster web-app, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/devtools-mobile/">connect your phone’s Chrome instance to your laptop’s Chrome DevTools</a>, and open the console. You’ll see the <code>token</code> printed right there. You can copy and use it wherever you’d like.</p>
<h2 id="Lifetimes"><a href="#Lifetimes" title="Lifetimes"></a>Lifetimes</h2><p>The only unknown factor here is the <code>rawToken</code> lifetime. It’s difficult to know for sure how TicketMaster’s backend server uses <code>rawToken</code> to look up the ticket. It’s likely that a new <code>rawToken</code> is generated every time the client contacts the <code>/api/render-ticket/secure-barcode</code> endpoint.</p>
<p>I have no idea how long each <code>rawToken</code> remains valid. It’s possible that only a single <code>rawToken</code> could be valid for a given TicketMaster account at a time. Indeed TicketMaster devs probably designed the system that way to prevent extracting multiple tickets which are concurrently valid.</p>
<p>If multiple <code>token</code>s are valid concurrently, one person could buy dozens of tickets, extract however many ticket <code>token</code>s they’d like, and resell them under-the-table. I would really love if TicketMaster didn’t think of that, because then I could extract the ticket <code>token</code>s for my friends and distribute them without having to go through TicketMaster’s data-harvesting pipeline.</p>
<p>The only authoritative source I could find on this is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/partner/safetix/">an obscure document on TicketMaster’s developer API docs website</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Partners will need to refresh the token 20 hours prior to the start of the event and whenever the ticket is displayed in your app.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>FAQ</p>
<ol>
<li>How often must the token be refreshed? You should refresh the token anytime a fan opens and views a ticket within your app and 20 hours prior to the event. If you are unable to refresh the token when the fan views the ticket at the gate, then the SDK would attempt to use the token refreshed 20 hours prior. The token should still be valid. You do not need to refresh the token every 20 hours.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on this, it might be reasonable to assume the <code>rawToken</code> is only valid for a 20 hour period, which would mean you’d need to fetch the <code>rawToken</code> at most 20 hours before the event to be able to resell or transfer it without TicketMaster’s permission. However, if all you want to do is save a ticket offline, this is more than adequate. I even built a little <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://expo.dev/">Expo</a> app I call <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/conduition/ticketgimp"><em>TicketGimp</em></a> which renders SafeTix barcodes if you give it a <code>token</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://conduition.io/images/ticketmaster/ticketgimp.png"></p><p>I look forward to testing it out when my concert comes around.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I think we can all agree: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=fuck+ticketmaster&amp;ia=web">Fuck TicketMaster</a>. I hope their sleazy product managers and business majors read this and throw a tantrum. I hope their devs read this and feel embarrassed. It’s rare that I feel genuine malice towards other developers, but to those who designed this system, I say: <em>Shame.</em></p>
<p>Shame on you for abusing your talent to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ticketnews.com/2021/07/mobile-only-ticketing-push-leaving-many-without-smartphones-behind/">exclude the technologically-disadvantaged</a>.</p>
<p>Shame on you for letting the marketing team <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://business.ticketmaster.com/business-solutions/safetix-the-game-changer-in-digital-ticketing/">dress this dark-pattern as a safety measure</a>.</p>
<p>Shame on you for supporting a company with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/live-nation-ticketmaster-class-action-1235070131/">such cruel business practices</a>.</p>
<p>Software developers are the wizards and shamans of the modern age. We ought to use our powers with the austerity and integrity such power implies. You’re using them to exclude people from entertainment events.</p>
<p>Have fun refactoring your ticket verification system.</p>

        <section>
            <p>In 2022, I left Google in search of a sustainable approach to open source maintenance. A year later, I was a <a href="https://words.filippo.io/full-time-maintainer/">full-time independent professional open source maintainer</a>. Today I’m announcing the natural progression of that experiment: Geomys,<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> a small firm of professional maintainers with a portfolio of critical Go projects.</p>
<p>I’m joined by <strong><a href="https://github.com/drakkan?ref=words.filippo.io">Nicola Murino</a></strong>, who's been maintaining <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh?ref=words.filippo.io">golang.org/x/crypto/ssh</a> for us since last summer<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>, and by <strong><a href="https://honnef.co/?ref=words.filippo.io">Dominik Honnef</a></strong>, the maintainer of <a href="https://staticcheck.dev/?ref=words.filippo.io">Staticcheck</a> and <a href="https://gotraceui.dev/?ref=words.filippo.io">Gotraceui</a>. They are now Geomys’ first ✨ <em>Associate Maintainers</em>. ✨ The team is completed by <strong>Matilde Dal Zilio</strong>, our Administrative Director who's been helping make this journey possible from the beginning.</p>

<p>Every company that was previously a client of mine is now a Geomys client, paying the same monthly retainer for the professional maintenance of their critical dependencies, and for direct access to the expertise of maintainers. What’s changed is that they are now supporting more projects, and have access to more maintainers.</p>
<p><img src="https://words.filippo.io/content/images/2024/07/logos-2024-1-.png" alt="The logos of Geomys’ first clients: Latacora, Interchain, Smallstep, Ava Labs, Teleport, SandboxAQ, Tailscale, and Charm" loading="lazy"></p>
<h2 id="how-we-got-here">How we got here</h2>
<p>I started with a rather non-consensus hypothesis: companies <em>want</em> to pay for their critical open source dependencies, but most projects are not selling them a legible way to do so. The last year has shown I was definitely onto something: I have signed four more major clients, and lost only one.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The model and pitch also came into clearer focus. Truly, it’s simple: if you’re betting your business on a critical open source technology, you</p>
<ol>
<li>want it to be sustainably and predictably maintained; and</li>
<li>need occasional access to expertise that would be blisteringly expensive to acquire and retain.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>Getting maintainers on retainer solves both problems for a fraction of the cost of a fully-loaded full-time engineer. From the maintainers’ point of view, it’s steady income to keep doing what they do best, and to join one more Slack Connect channel to answer high-leverage questions. It’s a great deal for both sides.</p>
<p>There were more lessons learned, which can be summarized as “yup, these are enterprise sales, checks out”, and “advisor is a better word than consultant but still not perfect”, and “we sorely need to build standard contract language”. I will write these up soon, but if you’re impatient you can watch <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2000-maintaining-go-as-a-day-job-a-year-later/?ref=words.filippo.io">my recent FOSDEM talk</a>.</p>
<p>Still, even if the path may look straightforward in hindsight, it’s a new model and materializing it has been a challenge. I am incredibly grateful to my clients for believing in it and for making it work with me.</p>
<h2 id="what-next">What next</h2>
<p>Now, where do we go from here? How do I help this grow?</p>
<p>One way is by making it easier to do what I did, so that others can replicate it. Part of the point of doing it myself was clearing a path and making the life of future professional maintainers easier. That’s still part of the plan, but for “open source maintainer” to graduate to a mature profession, it needs to also be accessible to folks who can’t or don’t want to take on that risk, uncertainty, and extra workload.</p>
<p>From the onset, I envisioned small firms of professional maintainers with thematic portfolios, accommodating diverse maintainers and project sizes, just like the specialized firms of other professionals. I am now ready to try and build one.</p>
<p>I can tell you when I made up my mind, actually. It was with this message from a client:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I noticed that there are two critical Go projects that we (and many others) rely on are not very actively maintained. […] Do you have any interest to become owners/co-maintainers of these projects? We'd be interested in sponsoring the maintenance, security audit, and hardening of those projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They trust us to maintain open source projects as a reliable team of professionals, and they understand the importance of keeping their critical dependencies healthy, so they want us to get involved in more. That's what we'll do.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="geomys">Geomys</h2>
<p>Alright, so how does Geomys work?</p>
<p>Clients still pay a fixed monthly retainer to ensure the professional maintenance of the whole portfolio, and to get access to the expertise of all of Geomys’ maintainers. It’s a package deal because in my experience it’s nearly impossible to rigorously apportion value to specific projects, and it would slow down the sales process. Also, it risks penalizing smaller projects, and I want every project in the Geomys portfolio to be sustainably funded. Instead, clients just have to decide if the portfolio as a whole is worth the sticker price.</p>
<p>Associate Maintainers get a stable, guaranteed income—significantly higher than what GitHub Sponsors generates—and a cut of future retainer revenue growth. There’s no formula, we negotiate and figure out numbers that make the Associate happy and that are sustainable for Geomys, based on the project and on how much time the maintainer wants to dedicate to them. I expect the percentage value of the revenue share to go down over the years, rewarding those who take the most risk by joining early.</p>
<p>The expectations of Associates are primarily to keep doing what they’re doing: they are already experienced maintainers who know how to keep their projects healthy, now with the freedom and peace of mind of sustainably dedicating proper part-time or full-time attention to them. We want them to work on their schedule, and in their own way. I don’t wish to micromanage anyone, nor would I be particularly good at it. I like to think of Geomys as enabling maintainers to do what they already do well.</p>
<p>We only ask that they join the Geomys Slack Connect channels of interested clients, and ideally that they work with our technical writer to publish the occasional article about what they’re up to. Geomys is not meant to overshadow the Associates’ profiles. Quite the opposite: its brand is as strong as the combination of those of all its maintainers.</p>
<p>Speaking of technical writers, Geomys covers and consolidates the cost of support staff, providing maintainers access to resources that would be hard to justify if working solo. Administration, legal, comms, and importantly, the sales process are all handled as a unit.</p>
<p>No copyright assignment. No locked in term. No GitHub ownership transfer. If we decide it’s not working, we go our own ways. Who knows, maybe one day our associates will spawn their own firms, like it happened with early information security consultancies.</p>
<p>We’ll grow slowly and organically, by recruiting Associate Maintainers when it makes sense (and we can sustainably afford it) and by adopting projects that are a good fit for the portfolio theme. We are taking no investments: this is all financed by my existing cash flow. Don’t get me wrong, I think this is going to make me money in the long term: as we grow we’ll appeal to more and more clients, and the marginal effort required by each client is sub-linear. However, Geomys will probably never be a unicorn, and after cutting in Associates I doubt I’ll get startup-founder rich. That’s ok, that was never the goal.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Geomys will always focus on Go. It’s not aiming to become <em>Open Source Maintainers, Inc.</em>, a one-stop shop for maintenance services, just like you largely don’t go to <em>Lawyers, Inc.</em> for all your tax, immigration, criminal, and human rights law needs. That ensures our portfolio is highly relevant to our clients, and avoids diluting access too much: having an account manager join your Slack is not the same thing as having the actual maintainers. It also lets us concentrate on what we are all actually experts in. I hope others will set up similar firms in other ecosystems, and I will be here to help them however I can.</p>
<p>We’re just getting started and we’re still learning, so I expect things will change as we get more experience. Whatever final form it will take, I believe this is another step down the road of making “open source maintainer” a mature profession, and I’m really excited to find out where it leads.</p>

<p>The plan for Geomys came together while I was driving the <a href="https://www.centopassi.net/?ref=words.filippo.io">Centopassi</a>, the 1600km-in-three-days motorcycle competition <a href="https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/xaes-256-gcm/#the-picture">I told you about in the last Cryptography Dispatches issue</a>. The intercom battery had ran out, so I was alone with my thoughts for a couple hours.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> This is the view that opened up right after that stretch of mountain roads. (Also, the Geomys logo is inspired by a different town we passed at the beginning of that segment!)</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>It’s the scientific name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomys?ref=words.filippo.io">a genus of gophers</a>! <a href="#fnref1">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Nicola’s work on x/crypto/ssh has been a success, both for the project and for the business, even before Geomys was on the radar. We’ll talk about what he’s been up to soon. <a href="#fnref2">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn3"><p>This is news, too! We inherited it from the original author, who was ready to move on after serving the community for ten years. I volunteered to take over before I ever even thought of Geomys, because of how critical the package is in the Go ecosystem, but it’s a perfect fit for the portfolio. For now I am responsible for it, but we’re working to engage the perfect longer-term maintainer. More on this soon! <a href="#fnref3">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn4"><p>It didn’t even have anything to do with the services, we worked together very well for as long as practical, and parted on great terms. I would <em>not</em> have bet on such a low churn rate. Since this is a footnote I feel safe enough to say that despite knowing things were working out and clients looked happy, there were days I kinda braced for everyone to cancel at the one-year mark or something. <a href="#fnref4">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Imagine you want to build specialized expertise in the functioning of an open source project internally. Even assuming you have enough interesting work to recruit and retain the right people, you will need to hire at least two Senior Software Engineers, or you lose all institutional knowledge as soon as one leaves. Really, to avoid refocusing on hiring upon a departure, you need three. You’re looking at north of a million dollars per year, fully loaded. It’s a classic build vs. buy. When you frame it like that, my contracts are <em>cheap</em>. <a href="#fnref5">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn6"><p>We’re not ready to announce our plans for those projects, but we are talking with industry experts to rewrite part of them, to improve security and reduce the maintenance burden, and will reach out to the current owners to figure out next steps. It will make for an excellent case study and hopefully we’ll get to write about it! (That makes it four promised upcoming topics. I know. Don’t worry, the technical writer starts on the 15th.) <a href="#fnref6">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Or, rather, my teammate Harry decided I needed some time to think, and told me the intercom was still charging. He was spot on. <a href="#fnref7">↩︎</a></p>

An official announcement shortly followed, quietly signalling the end of coal-fired electricity in Alberta.</p><p>Many organizations contributed to this successful campaign through advocacy and research. The Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, the Lung Association and the Asthma Society of Canada were instrumental in highlighting the health impacts associated with air pollution from coal-fired electricity. The Pembina Institute, an Alberta-based clean-energy think tank, first intervened in a coal plant regulatory process in the late 1990s and, in 2009, published the first major proposal that showed the province could move to an unabated coal-free grid by 2030. Our research was ahead of its time and criticized as idealistic.</p><p><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/topics/coal/" target="_blank">Coal </a>accounted for 80 per cent of Alberta’s electricity grid in the early 2000s and it still amounted to 60 per cent just 10 years ago. When phasing out coal was just an idea being batted around, many said it couldn’t be done. This is not dissimilar to the rhetoric today around decarbonizing the grid. But Alberta’s experience phasing out coal shows environmental progress of this magnitude is possible.</p><p>In 2012, then-prime minister Stephen Harper mandated a nationwide phase-out of coal by 2061. A far-off target date that, nonetheless, provided certainty to the provinces and got the ball rolling. In <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/topics/alberta/" target="_blank">Alberta</a>, the Wildrose Party, then led by now United Conservative Party Premier <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/topics/danielle-smith/" target="_blank">Danielle Smith</a>, included a coal phase-out commitment in its 2012 election platform.</p><p>When the New Democratic Party came to power after the 2015 provincial election, they got to work delivering on a plan to accelerate the elimination of coal. This included strengthening Alberta’s industrial carbon pricing system, a commitment to 30-per-cent renewables by 2030 and a target date for phasing out coal by 2030 – a target built through consultation with experts and industry. The current federal government made a similar national commitment in 2016.</p><p>At the time, there were concerns about the impact this would have on jobs. We learned that workers benefit from new investments in cleaner electricity – if included in strategic planning from the start. Federal and provincial programs to support workers during this transition were made available, while community economic diversification and growth in jobs in other sectors have helped to offset some of this change. Research also shows there are opportunities in clean energy, such as from increased land revenues and municipal taxes.</p><p>Phasing out coal in Alberta was supported by good policy design driven by carbon pricing and regulations with clear targets that offered necessary certainty to the industry and stakeholders. Rapidly growing, low-cost renewable energy further supported the phase-out, along with companies investing in gas-fired electricity. All these actions accelerated the transition away from coal at a faster rate than anticipated.</p><p>So, for the first time in 150 years, coal is no longer part of Alberta’s electricity mix. It is important to celebrate and reflect on these milestones, while recognizing there is no time to rest before redoubling our efforts and looking to what’s next.</p><p>As Pembina Institute’s latest research shows, many countries are striving to be the first to decarbonize their electricity system and a decarbonized electricity system by 2035 is within reach in Canada. It would save households hundreds of dollars on their electricity bills, enhance the competitiveness of our industries, and attract more investments into Canada as industries all look to secure clean power. But, as with coal, powerful incumbents want to maintain the status quo. Neither Albertans nor our climate can afford to be locked in to burning greenhouse gas-emitting natural gas when we have better, lower-cost alternatives.</p><p>Renewable energy is already the most cost-effective form of new electricity generation, and costs continue to drop. However, we still need to bring more wind and solar energy online, along with storage. Historically a leader in renewable energy, Alberta’s seven-month renewables moratorium, new restrictions unique to renewables, and a market restructuring have chilled project development. Restoring certainty should be a priority for the government. Alberta also already has enough existing and planned gas on its grid to meet its electricity needs.</p><p>The future is abundant, affordable, zero-emissions electricity. But we also need to invest in updating our infrastructure to meet our modern-day needs. Alberta is behind on demand-side management measures – a tactic that has reduced energy demand by 15 per cent in Ontario. Canada is also behind on building interties between jurisdictions – an approach that supports resilient systems and allows us to benefit from our complementary strengths across the country in hydro and other renewables.</p><p>We urgently need to continue to reduce emissions and we have the tools to achieve this. As the coal example shows, success takes time – sometimes over the course of decades – and relentless fact-based advocacy.</p><p><i>Chris Severson-Baker is the executive director of the Pembina Institute.</i></p></article></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Xpra is known as <em>"screen for X"</em> : its <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Usage/Seamless.md">seamless mode</a> allows you to run X11 programs,
usually on a remote host, direct their display to your local machine,
and then to disconnect from these programs and reconnect from the same or another machine(s),
without losing any state.
Effectively giving you remote access to individual graphical applications.
It can also be used to
<a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Usage/Shadow.md">access existing desktop sessions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Usage/Desktop.md">start remote desktop sessions</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Xpra is <em>open-source</em> (<a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/COPYING">GPLv2+</a>) with clients available for <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/wiki/Platforms">many supported platforms</a>
and the server includes a built-in <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra-html5">HTML5 client</a>.
Xpra is usable over a wide variety of <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Network/README.md">network protocols</a> and does its best to adapt to any network conditions.</p>
<p dir="auto">Xpra forwards and synchronizes many extra desktop features which allows remote applications
to integrate transparently into the client's desktop environment:
<a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Features/Audio.md">audio input and output</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Features/Printing.md">printers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Features/Clipboard.md">clipboard</a>,

<p dir="auto">It can also <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Features/File-Transfers.md">open documents and URLs remotely</a>,
display <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Features/Image-Depth.md">high bit depth content</a>,
and it will try honour the <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Features/DPI.md">display's DPI</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here's what a seamless session with two windows (an <code>xterm</code> and <code>glxspheres</code>)
looks like when attached from an MS Windows 11 desktop client:

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In order to provide support for language servers and various tools, Zed automatically downloads binaries from the internet without user approval.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I noticed that Zed automatically downloads the NodeJS binary from <a href="https://nodejs.org/">https://nodejs.org</a> without asking or even informing the user about it. Right after starting it and opening a file, without doing anything else. And there’s no option to disable it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EDIT: Now I found that it downloads (here) even some proprietary binary from <a href="https://supermaven.com/">https://supermaven.com</a>, i.e. unaudited and unauditable code, without any verification (except TLS)! At least this is not downloaded by default… I hope…</p>

<p>EDIT2: Zed also automatically downloads and executes prebuilt language servers for C#, Clojure, Deno, Elixir, Gleam, GLSL, Lua, Terraform, Toml and Zig. It automatically resolves the latest version available on GitHub and downloads it, again, without any verification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- jirutka</p>

<p>The Zed Team does not currently plan to change their approach:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We do not have plans to abandon this approach since there's so much code written to support various frontend tools already, that rewriting those in Rust will take an eternity, so not sure what is actionable here, hence closing.</p>

<p>Of course they do.</p>

<p>Last winter, I rode a ski lift alongside a guy who claimed to be a retired Olympic ski tuner. Ski tuning, he said, was all a scam. If you keep your skis dry between days out they’ll stay sharp for their entire lifetime. Don’t get him started on waxing. His specific claim was that skis get blunt from corrosion, and all you have to do is keep them dry.</p>

<p>That didn’t seem right. In fact, it sounded like complete bullshit. Snow and ice are quite abrasive stuff, and even hard steel gets abraded after a while. It’s not unusual for a ski day to include 30km or more of sliding the edges on ice crystals, and so it’s hard to believe that abrasion doesn’t happen.</p>

<p>Turns out it does. Because, luckily, I do keep my skis dry. And I own a very impressive inspection microscope (OK, it’s a $30 one off Amazon, but whatever).</p>

<p>Here’s what one of my ski edges looks like after ~4 days since the last tuning:</p>

<p><img src="https://brooker.co.za/misc-blog/images/edge_blunt.jpg" alt="Picture of a blunt ski edge"></p>

<p>If that doesn’t make any sense to you, I don’t blame you. Here’s what you’re looking at:</p>

<p><img src="https://brooker.co.za/misc-blog/images/edge_diagram.jpg" alt="Picture of a blunt ski edge"></p>

<p>The ideal ski edge is a metal strip with a ~88° angle between the base and the sidewall of the ski. Here, you can see the base edge, and a “corner” on the edge. I’m not a metallurgist, but this sure looks like abrasion damage to me. Corrosion damage is more pitted, more rounded, and a lot more uneven.</p>

<p>Further down the ski, thing get even worse.</p>

<p><img src="https://brooker.co.za/misc-blog/images/edge_damage.jpg" alt="Picture of a blunt ski edge"></p>

<p>Here, the edge isn’t only rounded over, but small chunks of metal have ripped out to create tiny serrations in the edge. I suspect this effect is why blunt skis can feel “grabby” in some snow conditions.</p>

<p>Luckily, fixing this kind of damage isn’t hard. I use a 3D printed jig with a 500 grit diamond stone. A couple of glides down the edge is enough to completely clear this up. This is what the edge looks like after basic tuning:</p>

<p><img src="https://brooker.co.za/misc-blog/images/edge_sharp.jpg" alt="Picture of a blunt ski edge"></p>

<p>Here, the “corner” has completely disappeared, and been replaced with a nice clean sharp angle. The serrations are gone, and the edge is clean. For me, a sharp ski is the difference between fun and terror on an icy day. But maybe I’m in the pocket of Big Ski Tuning.</p>

<p>Knife sharpening nerds will notice that I’ve raised a significant burr here. I believe that race tuners will strop that burr off, but I’ve never noticed a difference (and, let’s be honest, the level of my skiing isn’t exactly “Olympic downhill”).</p>

aren’t homeless are “domestic” people, while they themselves are “street” people, or simply “bums.” Meduza’s special correspondent Irina Kravtsova spent several days with homeless people in St. Petersburg, asking them the most obvious questions “domestic” people usually have: Why can’t they just update their documents, get a job, and rent a place to live? According to Igor Antonov, who’s worked with homeless people for years, questions like these underestimate the extent to which life on the street can transform a person. When it comes down to it, returning to a “normal life” is easier said than done.</p><p>Kirill Nikolayevich is a typical retiree — a lonely, trusting old man with kind eyes. For most of his working life, he was a locksmith for a large company. Later, because his pension was so small, he also did some part-time construction work on a church —&nbsp;it didn’t pay well, but they fed him. At the construction site, he got involved with some scammers who talked him into taking out a micro-loan on his apartment —&nbsp;300,000 rubles, nearly $4,000 — so he could buy into a metal trading company.</p><p>His “business partner” then disappeared with the money, the pensioner couldn’t repay the loan, and the court evicted him from his apartment. “Kirill Nikolayevich isn’t able to defend himself in court,” said Igor Antonov, a volunteer from the charity organization <span data-id="1002479" data-title="Nochlezhki" data-body="<p>Nochlezhki is a St. Petersburg-based charity organization that helps homeless people; its “night bus” goes out to remote parts of the city to distribute food and clothing.</p>">“Nochlezhki.”</span> “He ought to be watching a movie while they catch the criminals, walking his dog in the evenings, but instead, they’re dragging him to court. And in court, as he told me, instead of defending himself, he just said, ‘You’re all assholes — not judges, assholes.’ But the judge said everything was by the book. Now, Kirill Nikolayevich lives on the street in St. Petersburg, his hometown, where he has to ask volunteers to boil water so he can make instant noodles.”</p><p>“It’s very difficult to catch someone right at the moment their life is falling apart&nbsp;— when they get sick, they lose their job, they started taking payday loans, and use alcohol to blunt the pain,” Antonov said. “And it’s extremely difficult to help someone who’s already been on the street for a long time. People change dramatically out there — that’s what nobody realizes.”</p><h2 id="7-ffd0873d89b54c4db9b354fc5bc10b4e906820b8bf9cea144b90a77b6dc50729">‘<strong>I don’t have anything at all’</strong></h2><p>49-year-old Anna has a swollen face, red eyelids, and gray hair that’s grown to her shoulders. When she was still a “domestic” person, she would dye her wavy hair a chestnut color before going to her job as an elementary school art teacher.</p><p>When Anna’s daughter was 20 years old, she got married and brought her 28-year-old husband back to Anna’s one-bedroom apartment to live. They didn’t live with the husband’s parents (who had a two-bedroom apartment) because his parents insisted that newlyweds should live separately from their parents to avoid fights. Anna began sleeping on a sofa they had in the kitchen, while Anna’s daughter and her husband took the bedroom. For the first year, the setup worked well.</p><p>One night, when her daughter was at work, Anna’s son-in-law caught her walking out of the shower and raped her for the next several hours, filming her all the while. When he was finished, he told her she was a “bitch,” that he was “fucking sick of cowering around her all the time,” and to “get the fuck out” of the apartment.</p><p>Anna went to stay with a friend. After several weeks, she called her daughter, who hung up on her and then sent a text message asking her not to call them anymore. “I don’t know what he told her,” Anna said.</p><p>Eventually, she bid her friend farewell and “left to wander.” She spent the first nights in the entrance to an apartment building, then relocated to the building’s cellar. Anna struggled to remember the first nights she spent on the street. “I sat in one park, then moved to another, and when it became completely dark, I started to feel uneasy about staying on the street&nbsp;— before that, I was completely afraid of the dark. There were a bunch of drunk guys wandering around. I bought some kind of alcohol, went into an apartment building, and dozed off by the morning.”</p><p>In the fall, when it got cold, Anna started going into a convenience store to warm up. When a security guard asked why she was there, Anna said she and her son-in-law “weren’t getting along.” “Got it,” said the man. The next day, he brought her a warm jacket and a hat, both of which had belonged to his mother before her death. He also gave her the cardboard she now uses to sleep on in the store vestibule, and he started slipping her expired — “but not spoiled” — food, according to Anna.</p><p>It’s difficult for Anna to determine the exact moment she started feeling homeless. When asked about her own feelings, she often answered, “What do you mean how? I just did it,” “Oh no, it wasn’t scary,” or “Well, I just started drinking a lot.” But during our second meeting, Anna became more introspective and tried to determine how exactly she’d felt. Before that “I hadn’t dug so deep,” she said.</p><figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>“Seriously, your questions are all like, ‘How were you feeling? When was the last time you were at peace?’ If that’s the way I thought about things, I would have killed myself already,” said Anna. “I remember how, the first night, I was so sick, there aren’t words to describe it.”</p><p>There was a pause, and we walked in silence for a while. I wasn’t sure whether to keep pressing her for answers; I knew that when I left, she would be all alone with her thoughts. It turned out, though, that she was just searching for the right metaphor. “It’s just like in a cartoon, see: I took a piece of chalk, drew a door, and disappeared through it.”</p><p>“Hey, you want to get ice cream? It’s on me!” Anna offered suddenly, despite the fact that neither of us can feel our legs because it’s so cold outside. She didn’t want to go into a diner, either.</p><p>“You’re asking about my home&nbsp;— how was it, what happened to it. But the tragedy isn’t the fact that I don’t have a home. It’s that I don’t have anything at all. A home — fine, whatever. The issue isn’t that I live on the street. It’s just that my old life is over. I can’t go back to it. That’s the hardest part.”</p><p>During our conversation, Anna would often fall silent, think about something for a bit, stop responding to questions, then return. She recalled how, at first, she didn’t see herself as a homeless person. “I still held onto the feeling that real bums don’t have homes, that they drank them away or realtors came and took them, but I still had a home. My apartment’s right over there, and I’m its owner, and I can go back to it whenever I want. I just don’t go there because I don’t want to —&nbsp;it’s my decision. But I do have a home.”</p><p>She started thinking of herself as a “bum” gradually. There was the time, for example, when she drank the coffee someone had left on a bench, and she caught someone looking at her as they passed by. “I realized he had seen that I was drinking a stranger’s coffee, and that he saw me as a bum. And I basically realized it was true.”</p><p>Anna works part time as a janitor at the convenience store, through someone else’s contract; she gives part of her paycheck to the person who works there officially. She doesn’t have anything but the clothes on her back, and she doesn’t have any plans for the future.</p><p>“I’ll live as long as I live,” she said. “There’s nowhere for me to go. And besides, you can get used to anything. It’s hard on the street, but was it easy at home? Everyone wants you to be kind, be good, be comfortable. And even then, nobody fucking needs you. And it’s not like that on the street, honestly. You’ve already crossed the line, at some level —&nbsp;you’re already bad by definition. It’s freeing.”</p><h2 id="26-2e5f9537d5e7b3584bb1d570ce548214ea78ab25c64a4920167cec011152e08f"><strong>‘Why are you helping a dirty bum like me?’</strong></h2><p>According to Igor Antonov, homeless people are often happy to be diagnosed with tuberculosis —&nbsp;for them, it means a year and a half in safety. “It sounds like dark humor, but even I get happy about it, because treatment is provided for homeless people with tuberculosis. Even if you get an arm and a leg amputated, after two or three days they’ll stick your torso back in the snow and put on the form that you’re ‘discharged and home,’” he said.</p><figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Antonov mentioned one woman whose feet turned black from frostbite. She tried three times to get treated at the hospital, but they continued to kick her out. “This woman with rotting, bad-smelling feet was finally given shelter by a passerby, and now she lives in the hallway of his building,” said Antonov.</p><p>“We’re trying to help her, but she probably won’t get into the hospital until the foot needs to be cut off. I took some pictures and sent them around to doctors, and they said, ‘Yes, she needs to be hospitalized, but it’s not an emergency —&nbsp;they might take her, they might not,” Antonov said. “But when someone’s already completely unconscious —&nbsp;when they have gangrene and worms —&nbsp;that’s when they’ll take them. When I talk about worms in people’s feet, that’s not just a scary story. It happens to homeless people very often.”</p><p>All homeless people were once “domestic,” and once viewed homeless people as “degraded,” anthropologist Pavel Inozemtsev told me. “Believe me, it’s not only you who feel contempt toward homeless people, it’s the homeless people themselves. One of them asked me, ‘Why are you helping a dirty bum like me?’ In their own eyes, they’re no longer just people who’ve had some bad luck but will soon recover and keep moving; they no longer feel like a part of their former world.”</p><figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Many people take the word “homeless” literally: a description of a person who doesn’t have a home, Antonov said. “But at the end of the day, it’s not about the house,&nbsp;we all know a lot of people who don’t own a house — they rent apartments and stuff like that. But still, true homelessness is when the absence of one’s own space combines with social exclusion.”</p><h2 id="36-a218373db25b89fa15917114527691638b2614808da796d86b4d36bb819e73d6"><strong>‘I lie down in the snow, shake for 15 minutes, then fall asleep’</strong></h2><p>I met 40-year-old Sasha outside of the Sortirovochnaya train station in St. Petersburg. For the last 11 years, he’s been living here on the street, spending winters on a blanket he lays right on top of a snowdrift in a strip of forest five kilometers (three miles) away.</p><p>Sasha used to have a room in a two-story log cabin in Ulyanovka, a township in the Leningrad region. When he was little, his mother was a heavy drinker and left him with his father, a soldier. After serving in the army, Sasha became a plumber for the emergency services. When he was 24, his father died.</p><p>“I basically buried him, then sat there and thought, ‘I don’t have anybody left.’ I went to work, returned home, boiled pelmeni, watched television. I had no family, nobody close. Not even anyone to talk to,” said Sasha. So he started drinking — and quickly developed a drinking problem, even blacking out a couple times.</p><p>“Then I came to, these gypsies were in my apartment, and I owed them a bunch of money. They started forcing me out of my room. I called the police, and it turned out the officer knew them, so he took their side. Now I can never go back to that room. Although I could!” Sasha said. “I never signed any papers giving them the room.”</p><p>According to Igor Antonov, this kind of thing happens a lot — people drive out their roommates and change the locks. “A lot of people aren’t able to stand up for themselves, to keep living in a place they’re constantly being driven out of. The police usually treat these situations as disputes, but they don’t try to resolve or settle the disputes&nbsp;— they don’t see it as their job.”</p><p>“Then whose job is it?”</p><p>“Nobody’s. Only the person himself. Either a person has the inner strength to fight for his territory, or he doesn’t.”</p><p>Since Sasha was kicked out of his apartment, he’s gone back to his old home a few times. He’s seen the lights on through the window, but he’s never dared to go inside. Since he’s been homeless, he’s run into his mother a few times (she’s now remarried and had more children), but he’s never approached her, and she’s never recognized him.</p><p>Sasha spoke quietly, looking around like he was distracted. While we spoke, he often used the word “home” to refer to the spot where he sleeps. He said he sleeps “under a canopy” and is separated from the frozen ground by “as much as” ten centimeters (four inches).</p><p>Sasha didn’t understand what everyone was afraid of. “The main thing is to warm up in the summer, find a blanket, and then you can live!” He didn’t show me his home right away. We walked around St. Petersburg’s Obukhovsky district, along the beltline on one side and a tall iron fence on the other. “Yes, I do sometimes get sick,” said Sasha. “But it’s like this: when I lived in a house, my teeth would hurt, and I often went to the dentist. And now, all my teeth have rotted, and it doesn’t hurt at all, I don’t even feel it!”</p><p>Eventually, Sasha found his own footprints leading back to his sleeping spot, and we turned to follow them. We climbed over a fence and started crawling through some branches. Sasha wasn’t used to leading guests, so he neglected to hold back the branches, letting them hit me in the face behind him. After walking a few more feet, he suddenly said we’d reached his home. On the snow-covered ground were an orange, a few plastic bottles, and a thin, beige blanket covered in black fabric. Sasha referred to this as a “tent.”</p><p>It was -19 degree Celsius (-2 degrees Fahrenheit) outside, but at 80 percent humidity, it felt more like -35 degrees (-31 degrees Fahrenheit)&nbsp;—&nbsp;you got the feeling that if you went to sleep, you wouldn’t wake up. “At night, I lie down here, shake for 15-20 minutes, then fall asleep,” said Sasha. He doesn’t have a watch or a phone, but he estimates that he usually falls asleep around 11:00 p.m. — recently, though, he’s started going to bed later, around 1:00 a.m.</p><p>Sasha gets up “at nine in the morning” and sets off on his usual route, searching for food in dumpsters. He travels about 13 kilometers (eight miles) a day doing this. In the evening, he goes to the Nochlezhki “night bus,” where volunteers give out hot food. He drinks hot tea and eats soup, not talking with anyone and giving monosyllabic answers to any questions. He knows people come with problems, so he’s tried to keep to himself for a long time.</p><p>He lost his passport six years ago. When asked why he doesn’t get a new one, Sasha answered vaguely, “Well, yeah, I ought to do that, I just can’t seem to get around to it.” I kept asking in disbelief, is it really easier to live this way than to get new documents, get a job, gradually save up to rent a place? However hard that may be, it can’t be worse than living in these awful conditions, can it? Especially since Sasha, according to himself and people who know him, almost never drinks.</p><p>Sasha didn’t open up about this until our second meeting. He said he’d actually tried to get a part-time job before, but homelessness is “a vicious cycle” that he hasn’t been able to get out of. “When an employer knows you’re homeless, that’s the attitude they take towards you,” he said.</p><figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>“Motivation is all about anticipation,” said Igor Antonov. “Let’s say I’m anticipating a sip of hot coffee in a thermos, so I extend my arm and get an electric shock. The second time, I extend my arm to the thermos and get another electric shock. And then you, Irina, say to me, ‘Igor, would you like some coffee?’ I’ll answer, ‘No, you know, you feel free to have some, but coffee hasn’t been working out for me.’”</p><p>That’s why people who have spent a long time living on the street are often unreceptive to the ideas and solutions that volunteers suggest. “I’ll say to a woman, ‘Let’s get you to the hospital —&nbsp;your feet are rotting!’ And she’ll answer, ’No, I’ve already been to the hospital three times’,” Antonov said.</p><p>We live in different worlds, in different realities, Antonov continued. “For me, as a ‘domestic’ person, the hospital means treatment. But they’ll take one look at that woman, and ten minutes later, she’ll be in the snow in a different part of the city, with the same hurt feet. She’ll already know on that door, and she knows how it ends for her. But from the outside, sure, it seems like their problems should be very easy to solve.”</p><p>Sasha’s least favorite part of his current life isn’t the lack of a house —&nbsp;it’s that every day is exactly the same as the rest. “Every day you get up, look for food, struggle, then boom&nbsp;— it’s nighttime, then morning, and it all starts again.”</p><p>Everything Sasha owns is on his body. He doesn’t even store food. “Why do I need so much? Everything I need, I find and eat. If I need more, I’ll find it.”</p><h2 id="60-e663ecb91874c37e660cc4e682a3dab36bed0b1bbb3a49349c87e48a689f8c38"><strong>‘I was free’</strong></h2><p>Denis is 42 years old. He and his wife Larisa live behind the garages, a few hundred meters from the “Europolis” mall in St. Petersburg. The <a href="https://meduza.io/image/attachments/images/006/565/860/original/e0yt1b8TYRKLehz6h2WMCQ.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">space</a> Denis has built looks like a <a href="https://meduza.io/image/attachments/images/006/565/876/original/9QpASuQQQyN3fOrps2xFDA.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">house</a> without a roof or walls: a sagging door frame without a door, a wardrobe with a mirror, a fireplace, and a bedroom consisting of a tiny canvas tent. A nearby tree is decorated with tinsel for the holidays.</p><p>In 2006, when Denis worked at a construction firm, his boss took a large advance for an order and disappeared with the money. It fell to Denis and his colleagues to pay the debt. Denis was forced to sell his apartment and work for three months without pay. After that, he was only able to find work as a mover or a shipping agent —&nbsp;his reputation in the construction industry had been ruined. “As long as he still had savings, we lived, and when they ran out, my wife said, ‘I’m not gonna feed you,’ and kicked me out. I left my stuff, my computer, and everything I’d earned with her, slammed the door, and left. I left in the clothes I was wearing. That’s my nature —&nbsp;an idiot,” said Denis.</p><p>After leaving home, he “wandered around the street for a bit,” then got a job. According to Denis, he sent some money to his wife for a while before finding out that she and her friend were living off of it together. “It went down, down, down from there. And now I’ve hit rock bottom,” he said. He wanted to become a janitor or a mover, but in the mid-2000s, these jobs were all occupied by migrants, who were being paid “a quarter of a quarter,” so practically nobody was hiring Russians. Even still, Denis eventually found a job “through acquaintances” as a janitor and plumber in Petrogradka.</p><p>One day, Denis was introduced to a friend’s sister, Larisa. Soon after, he moved in with her. Larisa is 15 years older, and Denis calls her Lyalya. Some time later, Larisa’s daughter got divorced, returned to her mother, and started using drugs. According to Denis, the daughter eventually kicked them out, but he was close to leaving himself because he could hardly restrain himself from hitting her and “going to jail under [article] 105 [murder], seeing how she “shakes down her mother for money.”</p><p>At first, Denis rented a room for himself and Larisa. At that point, he still made enough money from working as a courier. Eventually, though, the company went under, so they moved in with friends, then “to the dacha” (Denis has a building further out in Moscow Oblast, but it’s unfurnished, and there are no jobs in the area). In the fall of 2007, Denis and Larisa made their hut between the railroad and the garages and began living on the street. Denis started selling scrap metal and jars.</p><p>“There was a really nice clearing,” said Denis. “I set up the tent. Then more people started coming, and eventually we had a little tent city. It lasted about two years before the authorities came and cut down the ‘jungle’ [the trees growing around them].”</p><p>Denis spoke proudly about the tent he had made. “It was so warm in my tent that me and Lyalya would sleep in T-shirts and underwear when it was -25 degrees [Celsius, -13 degrees Fahrenheit] outside,” he said. “First of all, I insulated it, and second of all, there’s an old army method I use. You take two-kilogram metal milk powder cans and make four holes at the bottom. When your fire burns out, you collect the red coals and put them on two bricks in the tent, and in three minutes, no matter how cold it is outside, you can start to undress.”</p><p>“What did it feel like when you first started living on the street?” I asked.</p><p>“No feeling at all. Do you believe that? No regret, nothing. It might have even felt like relief.”</p><p>“Relief?”</p><p>“Relief that I was free.”</p><p>“In what way?”</p><p>“I lived through a war, I got into so much trouble here, in Petrogradka, as a regular, working person. And now I don’t have to get up at nine to go to work. I don’t have to report somewhere every 15 minutes. I just don’t have to, you know? I got up, and I left. If I do something, it’s for me. If I don’t do something, it’s fine. Nobody’s standing over me and blaming me.”</p><p>Sometimes, Denis and Lyalya climb into the tent, huddle together for warmth, and sleep like that for a day or two because they can’t bring themselves to go out into the cold. “But then we can go out for three days. We’ll go for a walk, get something to eat, get a little something else [alcohol], and have a smoke.”</p><p>Getting out of the tent and getting dressed is hardest in winter, especially when their boots have frozen and shrunk. “You should hear how much I curse when I’m pulling the boots on!” said Denis. “And when you’re collecting those cans, the ends of your fingers freeze really badly.” It’s also hard for them when “it’s impossible to run somewhere to warm up or hide from the rain, if you’re far from your tent.”</p><p>Despite the difficulties, however, Denis and Laisa aren’t saving up for a more permanent place. “I think me and Lyalya have become complete street people. It wouldn’t make any sense.”</p><div data-testid="material-note"><p><a href="https://meduza.io/feature/2021/03/22/ya-na-vas-ustroivshihsya-v-etoy-zhizni-smotryu-kak-na-rybok-v-akvariume" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Story</a> by <strong>Irina Kravtsova</strong>, reporting from St. Petersburg, edited by <strong>Valery Igumenov</strong>, with photographs for <em>Meduza </em>by <strong>Liza Zhakova</strong></p><p>Abridged translation by <strong>Sam Breazeale</strong></p></div></div></div>]]></description>
