  <p data-block-key="q2big">Breakthrough models AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2 solve advanced reasoning problems in mathematics</p><p data-block-key="7r8gq">Artificial general intelligence (AGI) with advanced mathematical reasoning has the potential to unlock new frontiers in science and technology.</p><p data-block-key="2a5b7">We’ve made great progress building AI systems that help mathematicians discover <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/exploring-the-beauty-of-pure-mathematics-in-novel-ways/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new insights</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/discovering-novel-algorithms-with-alphatensor/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">novel algorithms</a> and answers to <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/funsearch-making-new-discoveries-in-mathematical-sciences-using-large-language-models/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open problems</a>. But current AI systems still struggle with solving general math problems because of limitations in reasoning skills and training data.</p><p data-block-key="kuaa">Today, we present AlphaProof, a new reinforcement-learning based system for formal math reasoning, and AlphaGeometry 2, an improved version of our <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphageometry-an-olympiad-level-ai-system-for-geometry/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">geometry-solving system</a>. Together, these systems solved four out of six problems from this year’s <a href="https://www.imo2024.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">International Mathematical Olympiad</a> (IMO), achieving the same level as a silver medalist in the competition for the first time.</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="q2big">Breakthrough AI performance solving complex math problems</h2><p data-block-key="fmv98">The IMO is the oldest, largest and most prestigious competition for young mathematicians, held annually since 1959.</p><p data-block-key="2n0o6">Each year, elite pre-college mathematicians train, sometimes for thousands of hours, to solve six exceptionally difficult problems in algebra, combinatorics, geometry and number theory. Many of the winners of the <a href="https://www.mathunion.org/imu-awards/fields-medal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fields Medal</a>, one of the highest honors for mathematicians, have represented their country at the IMO.</p><p data-block-key="929s2">More recently, the annual IMO competition has also become widely recognised as a grand challenge in machine learning and an aspirational benchmark for measuring an AI system’s advanced mathematical reasoning capabilities.</p><p data-block-key="5vk51">This year, we applied our combined AI system to the competition problems, provided by the IMO organizers. Our solutions were scored according to the IMO’s point-awarding rules by prominent mathematicians <a href="https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~wtg10/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Prof Sir Timothy Gowers</a>, an IMO gold medalist and Fields Medal winner, and <a href="https://www.polyomino.org.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dr Joseph Myers</a>, a two-time IMO gold medalist and Chair of the IMO 2024 Problem Selection Committee.</p>
</div><div>
  <p data-block-key="lr8cb">First, the problems were manually translated into formal mathematical language for our systems to understand. In the official competition, students submit answers in two sessions of 4.5 hours each. Our systems solved one problem within minutes and took up to three days to solve the others.</p><p data-block-key="8tekc">AlphaProof solved two algebra problems and one number theory problem by determining the answer and proving it was correct. This included the hardest problem in the competition, solved by only five contestants at this year’s IMO. AlphaGeometry 2 proved the geometry problem, while the two combinatorics problems remained unsolved.</p>
</div><p data-block-key="ewrpn">Each of the six problems can earn seven points, with a total maximum of 42. Our system achieved a final score of 28 points, earning a perfect score on each problem solved — equivalent to the top end of the <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/year_info.aspx?year=2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">silver-medal category</a>. This year, the gold-medal threshold starts at 29 points, and was achieved by <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/year_individual_r.aspx?year=2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">58 of 609 contestants</a> at the official competition.</p><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="anhnq">AlphaProof: a formal approach to reasoning</h2><p data-block-key="fv51b">AlphaProof is a system that trains itself to prove mathematical statements in the formal language <a href="https://lean-lang.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lean</a>. It couples a pre-trained language model with the <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AlphaZero</a> reinforcement learning algorithm, which previously taught itself how to master the games of chess, shogi and Go.</p><p data-block-key="8k252">Formal languages offer the critical advantage that proofs involving mathematical reasoning can be formally verified for correctness. Their use in machine learning has, however, previously been constrained by the very limited amount of human-written data available.</p><p data-block-key="523pv">In contrast, natural language based approaches can hallucinate plausible but incorrect intermediate reasoning steps and solutions, despite having access to orders of magnitudes more data. We established a bridge between these two complementary spheres by fine-tuning a <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gemini</a> model to automatically translate natural language problem statements into formal statements, creating a large library of formal problems of varying difficulty.</p><p data-block-key="ev3b8">When presented with a problem, AlphaProof generates solution candidates and then proves or disproves them by searching over possible proof steps in Lean. Each proof that was found and verified is used to reinforce AlphaProof’s language model, enhancing its ability to solve subsequent, more challenging problems.</p><p data-block-key="erlti">We trained AlphaProof for the IMO by proving or disproving millions of problems, covering a wide range of difficulties and mathematical topic areas over a period of weeks leading up to the competition. The training loop was also applied during the contest, reinforcing proofs of self-generated variations of the contest problems until a full solution could be found.</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="q2big">A more competitive AlphaGeometry 2</h2><p data-block-key="97f90">AlphaGeometry 2 is a significantly improved version of <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphageometry-an-olympiad-level-ai-system-for-geometry/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AlphaGeometry</a>. It’s a neuro-symbolic hybrid system in which the language model was based on <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gemini</a> and trained from scratch on an order of magnitude more synthetic data than its predecessor. This helped the model tackle much more challenging geometry problems, including problems about movements of objects and equations of angles, ratio or distances.</p><p data-block-key="dmclu">AlphaGeometry 2 employs a symbolic engine that is two orders of magnitude faster than its predecessor. When presented with a new problem, a novel knowledge-sharing mechanism is used to enable advanced combinations of different search trees to tackle more complex problems.</p><p data-block-key="ebi92">Before this year’s competition, AlphaGeometry 2 could solve 83% of all historical IMO geometry problems from the past 25 years, compared to the 53% rate achieved by its predecessor. For IMO 2024, AlphaGeometry 2 <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/imo-2024-solutions/P4/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">solved Problem 4</a> within 19 seconds after receiving its formalization.</p>
</div><div>
  <h2 data-block-key="q2big">New frontiers in mathematical reasoning</h2><p data-block-key="agps5">As part of our IMO work, we also experimented with a natural language reasoning system, built upon <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gemini</a> and our latest research to enable advanced problem-solving skills. This system doesn’t require the problems to be translated into a formal language and could be combined with other AI systems. We also tested this approach on this year’s IMO problems and the results showed great promise.</p><p data-block-key="eqnun">Our teams are continuing to explore multiple AI approaches for advancing mathematical reasoning and plan to release more technical details on AlphaProof soon.</p><p data-block-key="9dmnq">We’re excited for a future in which mathematicians work with AI tools to explore hypotheses, try bold new approaches to solving long-standing problems and quickly complete time-consuming elements of proofs — and where AI systems like <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gemini</a> become more capable at math and broader reasoning.</p>

    Wait, what's reverse engineering?
</h3>
<p>
    Wikipedia defines it as:
    </p><blockquote>
        Reverse engineering, also called backwards engineering or back engineering, is the process by which an artificial object is deconstructed to reveal its designs, architecture, code, or to extract knowledge from the object. It is similar to scientific research, the only difference being that scientific research is conducted into a natural phenomenon.
    </blockquote>
    Whew, that was quite a mouthful, wasn't it? Well, it is one of the main reasons why this tutorial set exists. To make reverse engineering
    <i>
        as simple as possible.
    </i>

<p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>For many people, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee is the start of a great day. But <a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/caffeine-connection-between-coffee-and-headaches">caffeine can cause headaches and jitters</a> in others. That’s why many people reach for a decaffeinated cup instead.</p>

<p><a href="https://miamioh.edu/profiles/cas/michael-crowder.html">I’m a chemistry professor</a> who has taught lectures on why chemicals dissolve in some liquids but not in others. The processes of decaffeination offer great real-life examples of these chemistry concepts. Even the best decaffeination method, however, <a href="https://www.ncausa.org/Decaffeinated-Coffee">does not remove all of the caffeine</a> – about 7 milligrams of caffeine usually remain in an 8-ounce cup.</p>

<p>Producers decaffeinating their coffee want to remove the caffeine while retaining all – or at least most – of the other chemical aroma and flavor compounds. Decaffeination <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180917-how-do-you-decaffeinate-coffee">has a rich history</a>, and now almost all coffee producers use <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-is-caffeine-removed-t/">one of three common methods</a>.</p>

<p>All these methods, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15422119.2013.771127">which are also used to make decaffeinated tea</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180917-how-do-you-decaffeinate-coffee">start with green, or unroasted, coffee beans</a> that have been premoistened. Using roasted coffee beans would result in a coffee with a very different aroma and taste because the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-384947-2.00183-5">decaffeination steps would remove some flavor and odor compounds</a> produced during roasting.</p>

<h2>The carbon dioxide method</h2>

<p>In the relatively new carbon dioxide method, developed in the early 1970s, producers use high-pressure CO₂ to extract caffeine from moistened coffee beans. They pump the CO₂ into a sealed vessel containing the moistened coffee beans, and the caffeine molecules dissolve in the CO₂. </p>

<p>Once the caffeine-laden CO₂ is separated from the beans, producers pass the CO₂ mixture either through a container of water or over <a href="https://generalcarbon.com/facts-about-activated-carbon/activated-carbon-faq/">a bed of activated carbon</a>. Activated carbon is carbon that’s been heated up to high temperatures and exposed to steam and oxygen, which creates pores in the carbon. This step filters out the caffeine, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jf0518305">most likely other chemical compounds</a>, some of which affect the flavor of the coffee. </p>

<p>These compounds either bind in the pores of the activated carbon or they stay in the water. Producers dry the decaffeinated beans using heat. Under the heat, any remaining CO₂ evaporates. Producers can then repressurize and reuse the same CO₂.</p>

<p>This method <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-is-caffeine-removed-t/">removes 96% to 98% of the caffeine</a>, and the resulting coffee has only minimal CO₂ residue.</p>

<p>This method, which requires expensive equipment for making and handling the CO₂, is <a href="https://coffeecode.co.uk/decaffeination-4-main-methods/#google_vignette">extensively used</a> to decaffeinate commercial-grade, or supermarket, coffees.</p>

<h2>Swiss water process</h2>

<p>The Swiss water method, initially used <a href="https://coffeecode.co.uk/decaffeination-4-main-methods/#google_vignette">commercially in the early 1980s</a>, uses hot water to decaffeinate coffee.</p>

<p>Initially, producers soak a batch of green coffee beans in hot water, which extracts both the caffeine and other chemical compounds from the beans. </p>

<p>It’s kind of like what happens when you brew roasted coffee beans – you place dark beans in clear water, and the chemicals that cause the coffee’s dark color leach out of the beans into the water. In a similar way, the hot water pulls the caffeine from not yet decaffeinated beans.</p>

<p>During the soaking, the caffeine concentration is higher in the coffee beans than in the water, so the caffeine moves into the water from the beans. Producers then take the beans out of the water and placed them into fresh water, which has no caffeine in it – so the process repeats, and more caffeine moves out of the beans and into the water. The producers repeat this process, up to 10 times, until <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-is-caffeine-removed-t/">there’s hardly any caffeine left</a> in the beans. </p>

<p>The resulting water, which now contains the caffeine and any flavor compounds that dissolved out from the beans, gets passed through activated charcoal filters. These trap caffeine and other similarly sized chemical compounds, such as sugars <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/polyamine">and organic compounds called polyamines</a>, while allowing most of the other chemical compounds to remain in the filtered water.</p>

<p>Producers then use the filtered water – saturated with flavor but devoid of most of the caffeine – to soak a new batch of coffee beans. This step lets the flavor compounds lost during the soaking process reenter the beans. </p>

            <figcaption><span>This animation shows the steps to the Swiss water process.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>The <a href="https://www.swisswater.com/pages/coffee-decaffeination-process">Swiss water process</a> is prized for its chemical-free approach and its ability to preserve most of the coffee’s natural flavor. This method <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-is-caffeine-removed-t/">has been shown to remove 94% to 96%</a> of the caffeine.</p>

<h2>Solvent-based methods</h2>

<p>This traditional and most common approach, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-is-caffeine-removed-t/">first done in the early 1900s</a>, <a href="https://checkyourdecaf.org/">uses organic solvents</a>, which are liquids that dissolve organic chemical compounds such as caffeine. Ethyl acetate and methylene chloride are two common solvents used to extract caffeine from green coffee beans. There are two main solvent-based methods. </p>

<p>In the direct method, producers soak the moist beans directly in the solvent or in a water solution containing the solvent. </p>

<p>The solvent extracts most of the caffeine and other chemical compounds with a similar solubility to caffeine from the coffee beans. The producers then remove the beans from the solvent after about 10 hours and dry them.</p>

<p>In the indirect method, producers soak the beans in hot water for a few hours and then take them out. They then treat the water with solvent to remove caffeine from the water. Methylene chloride, the most common solvent, does not dissolve in the water, so it forms a layer on top of the water. The caffeine dissolves better in methylene chloride than in water, so most of the caffeine stays up in the methylene chloride layer, which producers can separate from the water. </p>

<p>As in the Swiss water method, the producers can reuse the “caffeine-free” water, which may return some of the flavor compounds removed in the first step. </p>

<p>These methods remove <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-is-caffeine-removed-t/">about 96% to 97% of the caffeine</a>.</p>

<h2>Is decaf coffee safe to drink?</h2>

<p>One of the common solvents, ethyl acetate, comes naturally in many foods and beverages. It’s considered a <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/coffee/is-decaffeinated-coffee-bad-for-you/">safe chemical for decaffeination</a> by the Food and Drug Administration. </p>

<p>The FDA and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration have deemed methylene chloride unsafe to consume at concentrations above 10 milligrams per kilogram of your body weight. However, the amount of residual methylene chloride found in roasted coffee beans is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10408699991279231">very small – about 2 to 3 milligrams per kilogram</a>. It’s <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/coffee/is-decaffeinated-coffee-bad-for-you/">well under the FDA’s limits</a>.</p>

<p>OSHA and its European counterparts have <a href="https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.1052">strict workplace rules</a> to minimize methylene chloride exposure for workers involved in the decaffeination process. </p>

<p>After producers decaffeinate coffee beans using methylene chloride, they steam the beans and dry them. Then the coffee beans are roasted at high temperatures. During the steaming and roasting process, the beans get hot enough that residual methylene chloride evaporates. The roasting step also produces new flavor chemicals from the breakdown of chemicals into other chemical compounds. These give coffee its distinctive flavor.</p>

<p>Plus, most people brew their coffee at <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/coffee/is-decaffeinated-coffee-bad-for-you/">between 190 F to 212 F</a>, which is another opportunity for methylene chloride to evaporate.</p>

<h2>Retaining aroma and flavor</h2>

<p>It’s chemically impossible to dissolve out only the caffeine without also dissolving out other chemical compounds in the beans, so decaffeination inevitably removes some other compounds that contribute to the aroma and flavor of your cup of coffee. </p>

<p>But some techniques, like the Swiss water process and the indirect solvent method, have steps that may reintroduce some of these extracted compounds. These approaches probably can’t return all the extra compounds back to the beans, but they may add some of the flavor compounds back.</p>

<p>Thanks to these processes, you can have that delicious cup of coffee without the caffeine – unless your waiter accidentally switches the pots.</p>

	<div>
					
<p>Hello,</p>



<p>Today I am doing a quick post to cover the recent CrowdStrike incident that is estimated <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpe3zgznwjno">to have disabled 8.5M computers </a>and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/24/crowdstrike-outage-companies-cost">caused more than $5.4B in damages</a> since last week.</p>



<p>Now a common questions is whether CrowdStrike will be liable for damages? The answer is most certainly yes. There is actually a very similar case that was brought to court a few years ago regarding the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incendie_du_centre_de_donn%C3%A9es_d%27OVHcloud_%C3%A0_Strasbourg">OVH incident</a>, in France. While it applies to France, which is the jurisdiction I am the most familiar with, the same principles will apply to many other jurisdictions.</p>



<p>One quick note to clear a common misconception before we begin. Most contracts have boilerplate terms to waive liability, there is a common misconception that they may waive liability, however they do not. These terms have no meaning in most jurisdiction outside of the US and either way, it’s not possible to waive liability in most circumstances (e.g. anything involving gross negligence, criminal activities or going against the law itself).</p>



<h2>About OVH</h2>



<p>OVH is a French datacenter and cloud provider, allegedly the largest hosting provider in Europe. They are most known for providing physical servers and virtual machines, as well as a variety of cloud services.</p>



<p>A fire broke out on 10th March 2021 in their SGB location. It burned down two datacenters SGB1 SGB2 with little or no recovery and rendered two more datacenters SGB3 SGB4 inoperable for a while.</p>



<p>What is interesting is the aftermath. Multiple sites were destroyed causing irrecoverable loss of service and loss of data to their customers. Multiple customers pursued them in court for damages and they won. </p>



<p>I found there were a few interesting points raised and discussed by the court:</p>



<ul>
<li>(Skipping the elements about the fire itself, to focus on the service and tech)</li>



<li>There was complete loss of service during and after the event</li>



<li>There was complete irrecoverable loss of data after the event</li>



<li>OVH provided a backup service for their machines and services</li>



<li>There was complete irrevocable loss of the backups after the event</li>



<li>There were multiple datacenters in nearby locations, as is standard practice to provide some resiliency: SGB1 SGB2 SGB3 SGB4</li>



<li>Multiple datacenters burned down at once.</li>



<li>The multiple datacenters were in fact in the same place, a few steps apart. That was considered unexpected and not reasonable by the court.</li>



<li>The backups were stored in the same datacenter or in the other datacenter that might happen to be in the same place. That was not considered reasonable by the court.</li>



<li>OVH tried to argue that customers should have followed good practice of having multiple backups in separate locations. The court acknowledged it was the good practice.</li>



<li>The court determined OVH was the backup provider, the court determined it was the role of OVH to provide backups to a reasonable standard and observe good practices. This includes storing a copy of the backup elsewhere as is good practice.</li>



<li>The court ruled the OVH backup service was not operated to a reasonable standard and failed at its purpose.</li>
</ul>



<p>I find it interesting for techies, the court will judge your tech and what can really be considered best practices. It’s like the ultimate code review 😀</p>



<p>To summarize how things work: harm done + intent to cause harm or negligence = potential for damages</p>



<p>There is significant harm caused to customers, as entire businesses were shutdown, often indefinitely with complete data loss and no possibility to recover. There are multiple occurrences of negligence, mistakes or questionable practices in how OVH was operating the service, which lead to the issue. It’s a solid case. There are multiple customers who opened a case against OVH and won. There may be more still being processed.</p>



<p>That brings us to CrowdStrike. The similarities are striking!</p>







<h2>About CrowdStrike</h2>



<p>CrowdStrike is an anti-virus software that is installed on computers. It’s sometimes called an EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) these days. It’s mostly installed on corporate devices in large companies, as they are required to have a security solution.</p>



<p>CrowdStrike runs on startup of the computer. It is deeply embedding itself into the operating system (Windows or Linux) at a kernel level, to run as soon as possible and before other things start. It monitors what runs, it can block and report anything that it deems suspicious.</p>



<p>On 19th July 2019, CrowdStrike pushed an update to their software. The update was bugged and crashed any computer it was deployed on. Millions of computers simultaneously received the update across the world and were rendered non functional. </p>



<p>I think there are multiple interesting points to raise and discuss:</p>



<ul>
<li>CrowdStrike runs at startup in a highly privileged mode (kernel driver on Windows) and it starts first.</li>



<li>It can prevent any other software and prevent the system itself from running, whether intentionally to block a threat or accidentally due to a bug or misjudging a non-threat.</li>



<li>It is deployed to millions of corporate devices in industries like banks, travel, supermarket, etc… it is largely targeted to critical industries and critical devices with confidential information.</li>



<li>It is a highly critical application operating in sensitive environments, which requires extra care to develop and to test.</li>



<li>On the day of the incident, CrowdStrike pushed the updates to millions of critical devices at once</li>



<li>Good practice requires to stage software upgrades.</li>



<li>How was it possible for CrowdStrike to ship a (broken) update to millions of devices in the span of minutes? Was there no testing and no staged rollout?</li>



<li>From discussion online, customers in hospitals have complained about this issue before and requested for CrowdStrike to allow some control on updates. One customers reported they were rejected with a 50 pages memo from CrowdStrike saying they refuse to stage anything.</li>



<li>Does CrowdStrike not have any ability to stage a rollout? They have repeatedly alluded that they did not and/or refused to. That may be in breach of regulated industries they sell to.</li>



<li>CrowdStrike is expected to be heavily tested to not disrupt the (critical) devices it is deployed to.</li>



<li>The update crashed any computer it was deployed to (BSOD).</li>



<li>How was it possible for an ostensibly broken update to not be detected before it was pushed to the outside world?</li>



<li>Does CrowdStrike do any testing whatsoever? Obviously they didn’t or the incident wouldn’t have happened.</li>



<li>It is not an isolated incident. The same thing happened few weeks earlier with the CrowdStrike agent on Linux, nuking the system and there may be other occurrences before.</li>



<li>After the bad update was pushed, it took nearly two hours for CrowdStrike to realize there was a problem and stop the update.</li>



<li>Developers working on critical software are required to monitor a deployment after deploying, to verify it’s working as expected and not causing issues.</li>



<li>What was CrowdStrike doing after deploying? Were they monitoring the deployment? Could they not notice that the update destroyed every machine it was deployed to?</li>



<li></li>



<li>All computers were rendered inoperable by CrowdStrike, unable to boot.</li>



<li>For affected companies, that left all their employees with a dead computer, unable to do anything.</li>



<li>It wasn’t possible for users to “access” the computer to raise a ticket or troubleshoot it.</li>



<li>It was a complete loss of service with no way to recover.</li>



<li>One way to fix the computer was for the IT team to be given the computer and completely reinstall (reimage) it.</li>



<li>Another way that was found later in the day, was for an administrator to access the computer physically AND try to boot in safe mode or recovery mode then delete the driver file for CrowdStrike. </li>



<li>This remediation can only be done with physical access to the affected computer AND by an administrator who has a special password (or USB key with the password) to start a laptop into recovery mode.</li>



<li>It will take weeks for affected companies to physically get a hand on every device, user laptop, desktop and server. It can be thousands to hundreds of thousands of devices to get to.</li>



<li>It will take longer for devices that are enclosed or difficult to access, like screen terminals in an airport, medical devices and machinery in a hospital, elevator panels.</li>



<li>It may be impossible to restore the device if the device is locked down somehow (physically blocked or recovery password unknown).</li>



<li>Employees who require a computer to work are unable to work during all that time. </li>



<li>It is not possible to provide a spare computer to affected users, the spares were affected by the issue too.</li>



<li>Crowstrike is a security software that was meant to keep computers running and protected from threats.</li>



<li>CrowdStrike destroyed the computers it was supposed to protect, it failed at its purpose.</li>
</ul>



<p>There is significant harm caused to customers. Businesses were partially or completely shutdown, for days or weeks. There are multiple occurrences of negligence, mistakes and questionable practices in how CrowdStrike was operating the service, which lead to the issue. The issue was not an isolated incident, as people have reported the same thing happened just few weeks before on a lesser scale.</p>



<p>That should leave CrowdStrike liable wide open to countless claims for damages.</p>



<p>Customers operating in regulated industries like healthcare, finance, aerospace, transportation, are actually required to test and stage and track changes. <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.co.uk/why-crowdstrike/crowdstrike-compliance-certification/">CrowdStrike claims to have a dozen certifications and standards</a> which require them to follow particular development practices and carry out various level of testing, but they clearly did not. The simple fact that CrowdStrike does not do any of that and actively refuses to, puts them in breach of compliance, which puts customers themselves in breach of compliance by using CrowdStrike. All together, there may be sufficient grounds to unilaterally terminate any CrowdStrike contracts for any customer who wishes to.</p>







<h2>Appendix</h2>



<p>As additional evidence, we can quote <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41007570">an employee working for BitLocker discussing their testing and rolling methodology</a>. BitLocker is a tool to securely encrypt the disk on your computer. It will prevent anybody else from reading any data if the computer is lost or stolen. It’s similarly critical. It’s the first thing to run on startup and nothing can run without it (no data can be loaded from disk). Any mistake or bug in BitLocker would render the computer unable to operate and render all data on it unreadable (full irrecoverable data loss, exactly like the OVH incident). They have many layers of testing, starting with testing on their own computer then their own team then other teams. Do CrowdStrike employees even have CrowdStrike running on their machine?</p>

<p>As additional evidence, we can quote another <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41007575">employee working for a non identified company</a>, who claims their company was hit by a previous CrowdStrike issue, they formally requested for CrowdStrike to allow staged rollout, CrowdStrike refused and sent back a 50 pages memo categorically refusing the idea. If that is true, this memo may now constitute critical evidence against CrowdStrike.</p>

<p>Finding the median in a list seems like a trivial problem, but doing so in linear time turns out to be tricky. In this post I’m going to walk through one of my favorite algorithms, the median-of-medians approach to find the median of a list in deterministic linear time. Although proving that this algorithm runs in linear time is a bit tricky, this post is targeted at readers with only a basic level of algorithmic analysis.</p>

<h3 id="finding-the-median-in-o-n-log-n">Finding the median in O(n log n)</h3>

<p>The most straightforward way to find the median is to sort the list and just pick the median by its index. The fastest comparison-based sort is <code>\(O(n \log n)\)</code>, so that dominates the runtime.<sup id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:3"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:3">2</a></sup></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>nlogn_median</span>(l):
    l <span>=</span> sorted(l)
    <span>if</span> len(l) <span>%</span> <span>2</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span>:
        <span>return</span> l[len(l) <span>/</span> <span>2</span>]
    <span>else</span>:
        <span>return</span> <span>0.5</span> <span>*</span> (l[len(l) <span>/</span> <span>2</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span>] <span>+</span> l[len(l) <span>/</span> <span>2</span>])</code></pre></div>
<p>Although this method offers the simplest code, it’s certainly not the fastest.</p>

<h3 id="finding-the-median-in-average-o-n">Finding the median in average O(n)</h3>

<p>Our next step will be to <em>usually</em> find the median within linear time, assuming we don’t get unlucky. This algorithm, called “quickselect”, was devevloped by Tony Hoare who also invented the similarly-named quicksort. It’s a recursive algorithm that can find any element (not just the median).</p>

<ol>
<li>Pick an index in the list. It doesn’t matter how you pick it, but choosing one at random works well in practice. The element at this index is called the <strong>pivot</strong>.</li>
<li>Split the list into 2 groups:

<ol>
<li>Elements less than or equal to the pivot, <code>lesser_els</code></li>
<li>Elements strictly greater than the pivot, <code>great_els</code></li>
</ol></li>
<li>We know that one of these groups contains the median. Suppose we’re looking for the <em>kth</em> element:

<ul>
<li>If there are <em>k</em> or more elements in <code>lesser_els</code>, recurse on list <code>lesser_els</code>, searching for the <em>kth</em> element.</li>
<li>If there are fewer than <em>k</em> elements in <code>lesser_els</code>, recurse on list <code>greater_els</code>. Instead of searching for <em>k</em>, we search for <code>k-len(lesser_els)</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s an example of the algorithm running on a list with 11 elements:</p>

<pre><code>Consider the list below. We'd like to find the median.
l = [9,1,0,2,3,4,6,8,7,10,5]
len(l) == 11, so we're looking for the 6th smallest element
First, we must pick a pivot. We randomly select index 3.
The value at this index is 2.

Partitioning based on the pivot:
[1,0,2], [9,3,4,6,8,7,10,5]
We want the 6th element. 6-len(left) = 3, so we want
the third smallest element in the right array

We're now looking for third smallest element in the array below:
[9,3,4,6,8,7,10,5]
We pick an index at random to be our pivot.
We pick index 3, the value at which, l[3]=6

Partitioning based on the pivot:
[3,4,5,6] [9,7,10]
We want the 3rd smallest element, so we know it's the
3rd smallest element in the left array

We're now looking for the 3rd smallest in the array below:
[3,4,5,6]
We pick an index at random to be our pivot.
We pick index 1, the value at which, l[1]=4
Partitioning based on the pivot:
[3,4] [5,6]
We're looking for the item at index 3, so we know it's
the smallest in the right array.

We're now looking for the smallest element in the array below:
[5,6]

At this point, we can have a base case that chooses the larger
or smaller item based on the index.
We're looking for the smallest item, which is 5.
return 5
</code></pre>

<p>To find the median with quickselect, we’ll extract quickselect as a separate function. Our <code>quickselect_median</code> function will call <code>quickselect</code> with the correct indices.</p>

<p>Quickselect excels in the real world: It has almost no overhead and operates in average <code>\(O(n)\)</code>. Let’s prove it.</p>

<h4 id="proof-of-average-o-n">Proof of Average O(n)</h4>

<p>On average, the pivot will split the list into 2 approximately equal-sized pieces. Therefore, each subsequent recursion operates on <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> the data of the previous step.</p>

<p>$$C=n+\frac{n}{2}+\frac{n}{4}+\frac{n}{8}+…=2n=O(n)$$</p>

<p>There are many ways to prove that this series converges to 2n. Rather than reproducing one here, I’ll just direct you to the excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1/2_%2B_1/4_%2B_1/8_%2B_1/16_%2B_%E2%8B%AF">Wikipedia article</a> about this specific infinite series.</p>

<p>Quickselect gets us linear performance, but only in the average case. What if we aren’t happy to be average, but instead want to guarantee that our algorithm is linear time, no matter what?</p>

<h3 id="deterministic-o-n">Deterministic O(n)</h3>

<p>In the section above, I described quickselect, an algorithm with <em>average</em> <code>\(O(n)\)</code> performance. Average in this context means that, <em>on average</em>, the algorithm will run in <code>\(O(n)\)</code>. Technically, you could get extremely unlucky: at each step, you could pick the largest element as your pivot. Each step would only remove one element from the list and you’d actually have <code>\(O(n^2)\)</code> performance instead of <code>\(O(n)\)</code>.</p>

<p>With that in mind, what follows is an algorithm for <em>picking pivots</em>. Our goal will be to pick a pivot in linear time that removes enough elements in the worst case to provide <code>\(O(n)\)</code> performance when used with quickselect. This algorithm was originally developed in 1973 by the mouthful of Blum, Floyd, Pratt, Rivest, and Tarjan. If my treatment is unsatisfying, their <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/BFPRT73.pdf">1973 paper</a> will certainly be sufficient. Rather than walk through the algorithm in prose, I’ve heavily annotated my Python
implementation below:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>pick_pivot</span>(l):
    <span></span><span>"""
</span><span>    Pick a good pivot within l, a list of numbers

    <span>assert</span> len(l) <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>

    <span># If there are &lt; 5 items, just return the median</span>
    <span>if</span> len(l) <span>&lt;</span> <span>5</span>:
        <span># In this case, we fall back on the first median function we wrote.</span>
        <span># Since we only run this on a list of 5 or fewer items, it doesn't</span>

        <span>return</span> nlogn_median(l)

    <span># First, we'll split `l` into groups of 5 items. O(n)</span>

    full_chunks <span>=</span> [chunk <span>for</span> chunk <span>in</span> chunks <span>if</span> len(chunk) <span>==</span> <span>5</span>]


    <span># Next, we sort each chunk. Each group is a fixed length, so each sort</span>
    <span># takes constant time. Since we have n/5 chunks, this operation</span>
    <span># is also O(n)</span>
    sorted_groups <span>=</span> [sorted(chunk) <span>for</span> chunk <span>in</span> full_chunks]

    <span># The median of each chunk is at index 2</span>
    medians <span>=</span> [chunk[<span>2</span>] <span>for</span> chunk <span>in</span> sorted_groups]

    <span># It's a bit circular, but I'm about to prove that finding</span>
    <span># the median of a list can be done in provably O(n).</span>
    <span># Finding the median of a list of length n/5 is a subproblem of size n/5</span>
    <span># and this recursive call will be accounted for in our analysis.</span>
    <span># We pass pick_pivot, our current function, as the pivot builder to</span>
    <span># quickselect. O(n)</span>
    median_of_medians <span>=</span> quickselect_median(medians, pick_pivot)
    <span>return</span> median_of_medians

<span>def</span> <span>chunked</span>(l, chunk_size):
    <span></span><span>"""Split list `l` it to chunks of `chunk_size` elements."""</span>
    <span>return</span> [l[i:i <span>+</span> chunk_size] <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(<span>0</span>, len(l), chunk_size)]</code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s prove why the median-of-medians is a good pivot. To help, consider this visualization of our pivot-selection algorithm:</p>

<p><img src="https://rcoh.me/images/median-of-medians.svg" alt="Pivot selection visualization"></p>

<p>The red oval denotes the medians of the chunks, and the center circle denotes the median-of-medians. Recall that we want our pivot to split the list as evenly as possible. Let’s consider the worst possible case – the case where are pivot is as close as possible to the beginning of the list (without loss of generality, this argument symmetrically applies to the end of the list as well.)</p>

<p>Consider the four quadrants (which overlap, including the center column (when the number of columns is odd) &amp; middle row):</p>

<ul>
<li>Top left: Every item in this quadrant is strictly less than the median</li>
<li>Bottom left: These items may be bigger (or smaller!) than the median</li>
<li>Top right: These items may be bigger (or smaller!) than the median</li>
<li>Bottom right: Every item in this quadrant is strictly greater than the median</li>
</ul>

<p>Out of these four two quadrants are useful because they allow us to make assertions about their contents (top left, bottom right) and two are not (bottom left, top right).</p>

<p>Now lets return to our original task, finding the worst possible case where our pivot falls as early in the list as possible. As I argued above, at a minimum, every item in the top left is strictly less than our pivot. How many items are there as a function of <code>\(n\)</code>? Each column has 5 items, of which we’ll take 3; we’re taking half of the columns, thus:</p>

<p>$$f(n)=\frac{3}{5}*\frac{1}{2}n=\frac{3}{10}n$$</p>

<p>Therefore, at each step, at minimum, we will remove, at minimum, 30% of the rows.</p>

<p>But is dropping 30% of the elements at each step sufficient? It’s worse than the 50% we achieved in the randomized algorithm. At each step, our algorithm must do:</p>

<ul>
<li>O(n) work to partition the elements</li>
<li>Solve 1 subproblem <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>5</sub> the size of the original to compute the median of medians</li>
<li>Solve 1 subproblem <sup>7</sup>⁄<sub>10</sub> the size of the original as the recursive step</li>
</ul>

<p>This yields the following equation for the total runtime, <code>\(T(n)\)</code>:</p>

<p>$$T(n)=n + T\left(\frac{n}{5}\right)+T\left(\frac{7n}{10}\right)$$</p>

<p>It’s not straightforward to prove why this is <code>\(O(n)\)</code>. The initial version of this post alluded to the master theorem, but someone recently brought to my attention that that is incorrect – since there are two recursive terms, you can’t apply the master theorem. Rather, the only straightforward proof that I’m aware of is by induction.<sup id="fnref:induction"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:induction">3</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="recap">Recap</h3>

<p>We have quickselect, an algorithm that can find the median in linear time given a sufficiently good pivot. We have our median-of-medians algorithm, an <code>\(O(n)\)</code> algorithm to select a pivot (which is good enough for quickselect). Combining the two, we have an algorithm to find the median (or the nth element of a list) in linear time!</p>

<h3 id="linear-time-medians-in-practice">Linear Time Medians In Practice</h3>

<p>In the real world, selecting a pivot at random is almost always sufficient. Although the median-of-medians approach is still linear time, it just takes too long to compute in practice. The <code>C++</code> standard library uses an algorithm called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introselect">introselect</a> which utilizes a combination of heapselect and quickselect and has an <code>\(O(n \log n)\)</code> bound. Introselect allows you to use a generally fast algorithm with a poor upper bound in combination with an algorithm that is slower in practice but has a good upper bound. Implementations start with the fast algorithm, but fall back to the slower algorithm if they’re unable to pick effective pivots.</p>

<p>To finish out, here’s a comparison of the elements considered by each implementation. This isn’t runtime performance, but instead the total number of elements looked at by the quickselect function. It doesn’t count the work to compute the median-of-medians. The point of this graph <strong>is not</strong> to demonstrate that median-of-medians is a good algorithm, but rather to demonstrate that it’s an effective way to pick pivots.</p>

<p><img src="https://rcoh.me/images/medians-graph.png" alt="Graph of elements visited"></p>

<p>It’s exactly what you would expect! The deterministic pivot almost always considers fewer elements in quickselect than the random pivot. Sometimes we get lucky and guess the pivot on the first try, which manifests itself as dips in the green line. Math works!</p>

<p>P.S: In 2017 a <a href="http://erdani.com/research/sea2017.pdf">new paper</a> came out that actually makes the median-of-medians approach competitive with other selection algorithms. Thanks to the paper’s author, Andrei Alexandrescu for bringing it to my attention!</p>

<p>Thanks to Leah Alpert for reading drafts of this post. Reddit users <code>axjv</code> and <code>linkazoid</code> pointed out that <code>9</code> mysteriously disappeared in my example which has since been fixed. Another astute reader pointed out several errors which have since been resolved:</p>

<ul>
<li>The recurrence relation was <code>\(7T(n/10)\)</code> but should have been <code>\(T(7n/10))\)</code></li>
<li>The master theorem is actually inapplicable in this case</li>
<li>I incorrectly referred to the top right, instead of top left quadrant in my arguments</li>
</ul>

Many of them are drivers or machinists—blue-collar workers for the company.&nbsp;</span></p><p>How? The company is owned by its employees. Every worker gets a salary but also a percentage of their salary in stock ownership. When the company does well, so do the employees—all of them, not just the ones at the top.&nbsp;</p><p><span>And the company </span><em>is</em><span> doing well. “When we sat down eight years ago, we said we want to be a billion-dollar company and have 1,500 people, we are on track to be both of those this year,” </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-ruger-b9763011/" rel="">Tim Ruger</a><span>, president of Central States, tells me.</span></p><p><span>That’s right, this manufacturing company will become a unicorn this year—one of only </span><a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/largest-companies-by-revenue/" rel="">6,000</a><span> companies in the world earning more than $1 billion in revenue. But unlike Walmart, Amazon, and Apple, it’s not just the executives getting paid out.</span></p><p>“It’s not like 80 percent of the company is owned by management and the rest is owned by employees, it’s really well spread across all functions,”&nbsp; Ruger tells me. “We've got a number of people that have been here 15, 20 years and they have $1 million plus balances, which is really cool for a person that came out of high school and runs our rollformer. You can’t do that everywhere.”</p><p><span>He’s right, and because you can’t do that everywhere there is a huge wealth disparity in America. Even though the economy has been on an upward trajectory for a century, the wealth it generates has funneled to a much smaller population who owns it. After </span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/an-alternative-to-tax-the-rich" rel="">a 1990s bill</a><span> meant executives started getting paid in stock options while the rest of their employees earned a static salary, executive pay skyrocketed with the market while their workers’ pay stagnated.&nbsp;</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8a6160-0cc6-4938-960c-754fa06a7532_1216x1172.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8a6160-0cc6-4938-960c-754fa06a7532_1216x1172.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8a6160-0cc6-4938-960c-754fa06a7532_1216x1172.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8a6160-0cc6-4938-960c-754fa06a7532_1216x1172.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8a6160-0cc6-4938-960c-754fa06a7532_1216x1172.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8a6160-0cc6-4938-960c-754fa06a7532_1216x1172.webp" width="1216" height="1172" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3f8a6160-0cc6-4938-960c-754fa06a7532_1216x1172.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1172,&quot;width&quot;:1216,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:91842,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8a6160-0cc6-4938-960c-754fa06a7532_1216x1172.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8a6160-0cc6-4938-960c-754fa06a7532_1216x1172.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8a6160-0cc6-4938-960c-754fa06a7532_1216x1172.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f8a6160-0cc6-4938-960c-754fa06a7532_1216x1172.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>If employees had also owned part of the company, their pay would have skyrocketed with the market too, but they didn’t. “It's hard to build true wealth for yourself if you don't have some type of ownership in something, and it's hard for most people to get ownership in something,” Ruger says.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Upping the minimum wage won’t fix that. As Nathan Schneider says in his book </span><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/2268/9781568589596" rel="">Everything for Everyone</a></em><span>: “One way or another, wealth is going to the owners—of where we live, where we work, and what we consume.”</span></p><p>So why not make workers the owners?</p><p><span>There is a growing movement to do just that. Central States is one of </span><a href="https://www.nceo.org/articles/employee-ownership-by-the-numbers" rel="">6,533 companies</a><span> that have formed an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (or ESOP) in the United States, and that number is growing by about 250 companies annually. That’s 14.7 million employees who have ownership in companies worth, collectively, $2.1 trillion.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Every year, those employees get a percentage of their salaries in company stock. During Central States’ worst year, employees earned the equivalent of 6 percent of their pay in stock, during their best they earned 26 percent. Last year, an employee earning $100,000 a year received $26,000 worth of stock in their account. As the company has grown, the value of that stock has averaged 20 percent returns annually, outperforming the stock market.&nbsp;</p><p>Just like Jeff Bezos can sell a portion of his Amazon stock to buy a new house, employees at ESOPs can pull money out of their stock accounts to pay for tuition, medical bills, or as a downpayment on a primary residence.&nbsp;</p><p><span>“We have several in production and drivers who have been here for over 20 years that have multi-million dollar accounts,” </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chad-ware-b9307b234/" rel="">Chad Ware</a><span>, Central States’ CFO tells me. “We’ve had several folks take out enough money to buy a home outright.”</span></p><p>An ESOP account functions a lot like a second 401k, but invested solely in the company. Employees can pull out whenever they’d like, but outside of those approved uses they will have to pay taxes and an early withdrawal fee to remove the funds before the age of 59 ½. After they leave the company or retire, the complete balance of their accounts will be paid out to them over a six-year period.&nbsp;</p><p>This means the company needs to have that cash on hand to pay out, and this has to be budgeted into their annual cash flow. But it also means the employees are incentivized to participate in the wellbeing of the company.</p><p><span>On the stock market, executives are expected to produce quarterly results, often to the detriment of their companies’ long-term success. After Boeing famously rushed the rollout of its 737 MAX aircraft to meet quarterly expectations, fatal crashes and safety concerns killed </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-says-boeing-breached-2021-deferred-prosecution-737-max-agreement-2024-05-14/" rel="">346 people</a><span> and cost the company </span><a href="https://knowledge.insead.edu/strategy/boeings-tragedy-fall-american-icon#:~:text=The%20737%20MAX%20fleet%20was,was%20reduced%20and%20then%20stopped." rel="">$20 billion</a><span>. Companies like Wells Fargo, Sears, and Bausch Health have similarly cut corners to inflate short-term results at the expense of their long-term health.</span></p><p>But an employee at Central States doesn’t care about one good quarter, they care about a good 10 years, and a good 50. If the company’s products turn out to be inferior next year their stock in the company will tank, if the company goes bankrupt in 20 years it will go down to zero. It’s in their best interest to act in the long-term interest of the company, and to grow it sustainably rather than quickly.&nbsp;</p><p><span>“One of our CEOs likes to say that these companies are not looking to hit home runs, they're looking to hit singles and doubles on a regular basis,” </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noelle-montano-a940106/" rel="">Noelle Montaño</a><span>, executive director for Employee-owned S Corporations of America (or </span><a href="https://esca.us/" rel="">ESCA</a><span>) tells me. “When the C-Suite goes into work every day, they see the receptionist, the person on the factory floor, the guy who's building the building or digging the ditches, and they know that those are the shareholders they are responsible for. They take that seriously.”</span></p><p>Every month, Central States executives share the company’s P&amp;L with employees, and every year they share the financials of the business at annual shareholders meetings, where employee-owners can participate in discussions about the future of the company. After a new plant was struggling with sales in its second year, one employee-owner raised his hand at a shareholder meeting and said, “This isn’t helping our company, and it’s not helping my share price, can we discuss the closure of this plant?”&nbsp;</p><p>“It was a great conversation, I love the fact that it’s not somebody else's problem,” Ruger says. “They're thinking like business owners, which is what you want, right?”</p><p>As a result, ESOPs are generally healthier companies. “These companies do better at employee retention, they do better at retirement benefits, they default less often on loans,” Montaño says. “Our companies did better during the Great Recession, they did better during Covid.”</p><p><span>There are serious benefits to the company for operating this way. ESOPs are a viable alternative to unions—there is no rift between the owners and the workers, workers </span><em>are </em><span>the owners! They are also exempt from paying income tax—though they tend to spend those dollars on their employees instead.&nbsp;</span></p><p>“It helped us grow when we were smaller. Now that we're larger, what we're paying out each year to our employee-owners is probably more than we would pay in tax, quite honestly,” Ruger says. “But if I have to choose who we pay our money to, I'd rather pay employee owners than give it back to the government. I think it's probably the right way.”</p><p><span>He brings up a good point. I’ve mentioned before that I do not think the answer to our wealth disparity is to “</span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/an-alternative-to-tax-the-rich" rel="">tax the rich</a><span>.” Don’t take Jeff Bezos’ money and give it to the government, better distribute Amazon’s earnings among its employees—not just to its founder.</span></p><p>“I think our taxes are way too burdening and we don’t do a good job using the money. I wouldn’t mind paying more if we were using it well, I just don’t know if we are,” Ruger says. “Why redistribute the wealth after it’s already been earned, why can’t we earn it beforehand? It naturally levels out the haves and have-nots.”</p><p>It’s worth noting that the “haves” still benefit from this equation. </p><p>“Most ESOP companies start because the founder wants to exit or cash out, but they don't want to sell to a private equity firm that will run their company into the ground or slash and burn employee headcount,” Ware says. “A lot of owners built a company and were in the trenches with the people beside them. They want to take care of them, but they also want to cash out. A good option is to set up an ESOP, and that's exactly how Central States got started.”</p><p>Carl Carpenter founded Central States in 1988, but sold it to his employees when he retired in 1991. More specifically: He sold a portion of the shares of his company to an ESOP trust, which holds the company's shares on behalf of the employees. In 2011, the company bought the remaining shares and became 100% employee-owned. Carpenter sailed into the sunset with a nice retirement package even as he allowed his employees to start building their own, and I don’t see why every founder shouldn’t do the same.&nbsp;</p><p>“There are real benefits for an owner turning the company into an ESOP,” Ruger says. “They personally benefit from the sale when they exit the business. Additionally, there are some real tax benefits to turn it into an ESOP—they pay a whole lot less taxes when they sell the company.”</p><p>The only reason they don’t do it more often is because they don’t know about it. “The number one issue is education,” Montaño says. “If you're looking to sell your business and you go to your accountant or lawyer, they may not say ‘Have you thought about an ESOP?’”&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also not a quick process—founders interested in selling to their employees need to plan ahead. A feasibility study needs to be conducted to ensure the viability of an ESOP plan and an independent valuation of the company needs to be conducted to determine the fair market value of the shares. A trust needs to be defined and structured, and a trustee appointed to oversee it on behalf of the employees. “If an owner just wants to get out, an ESOP is not for them,” Montaño says.&nbsp;</p><p><span>That might be changing, ESOPs have bi-partisan support in Congress and moves have been made to improve education about ESOPS and make the transition easier for founders. “We have support from Members of Congress across the political spectrum.... It's capitalism at its best,”&nbsp; Montaño says. “A year and a half ago, there was legislation mandating the Department of Labor to open an </span><a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ebsa/ebsa20230710" rel="">Office of Employee Ownership</a><span>, and they've taken a more robust interest in ESOP companies and recently appointed someone from the employee ownership community to this important role.”</span></p><p><a href="https://www.nceo.org/articles/employee-ownership-by-the-numbers#6" rel="">In 2022</a><span>, only 34 percent of families in the bottom half of income distribution held stocks, while 78 percent of families in the upper-middle-income group did—95 percent of families in the top one percent held stocks. But employee ownership changes that equation. As the process becomes easier and education about ESOPs grows, more and more founders will exit by selling their companies to their employees, and the result is that more and more of the wealth will be owned by everyone who works, not just the person they work for.</span></p><p>As the stock market gets richer, so will we all, and that’s a future I’m excited about working toward.&nbsp;</p><p>“I'd love to see it more and more and more,” Ruger says. “It's really generating wealth for people, I’m convinced we're going to change generations.”</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.elysian.press/p/employee-ownership/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/employee-ownership/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p><span>This is a continuation of my </span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/t/capitalism" rel="">capitalism series</a><span> which is figuring out how capitalism can work better for everyone while serving as research for my utopian novel.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><time datetime="2024-07-24T06:36:00.000Z">Jul 24, 2024</time></p><p>In January of 2021 I was exploring the corpus of Skins I collected for the <a href="https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/winamp-skin-musuem/">Winamp Skin Museum</a> and found some that seemed corrupted, so I decided to explore them. Winamp skins are actually just zip files with a different file extension, so I tried extracting their files to see what I could find.</p><p>This ended up leading me down a series of wild rabbit holes where I found:</p><ul><li><p>Encrypted files which I was able to crack to discover their secrets</p></li><li><p>A gift a dad in Thailand had made for his two and a half year old son, but didn’t want published online</p></li><li><p>Somebody’s email password</p></li><li><p>A secret biography of Chet Baker</p></li><li><p>Cryptic backwards audio files</p></li><li><p>A file called <code>worm.exe</code> which held quite the surprise</p></li><li><p>A host of extremely random images and files</p></li><li><p>56 previously unknown Winamp skins hidden inside other Winamp skins!</p></li></ul><p>This all aligned perfectly with my love of <a href="https://jordaneldredge.com/tag/winamp/">Winamp</a>, my love of <a href="https://jordaneldredge.com/tag/found/">found items</a> and was enabled by storing all the data I have about these skins <a href="https://twitter.com/captbaritone/status/1535471373191028737">in an sqlite database</a> (as <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31703874">discussed on Hacker News</a>).</p><p>Here’s the story:</p><hr><p>The first corrupted file I looked at contained just a PDF advertising a rentable bowling pin mascot costume:</p><p><img src="https://jordaneldredge.com/notion-mirror/84ebb48c-616a-4f51-ae9a-991a4e0a7e9b/e94461bd-1f9c-4ef4-bbda-23acc32ef0df/EsErCPFVoAACjOn.jpeg" alt="" height="1534" width="1406"></p><hr><p>Another was called <code>bobs_car.wsz</code> and, as advertised, contained just this picture, which I have to assume is the titular “Bob’s car”.</p><p><img src="https://jordaneldredge.com/notion-mirror/84ebb48c-616a-4f51-ae9a-991a4e0a7e9b/02d049fc-ee84-42b7-95f1-52c4c434db63/bobs_car.jpg" alt="" height="273" width="384"></p><hr><p>But then things got interesting.

No idea why it might have been encrypted.</p><hr><p>Another one had been created by a dad in Thailand who made an Adobe Illustrator mock up illustration of a Winamp skin he had designed as a gift to his two and a half year old son. But he didn't know how to make it a skin, so he sent it to <a href="http://winamp.com/">winamp.com</a> (along with a text file letter) asking that it be made into a skin that he could use. The letter was very touching but he asked them not to share the skin, so I have not included it here.</p><hr><p>I found another encrypted zip file. This time the password was not in my wordlist. After a bit of fiddling with the cracking tool’s config file, I was able to brute force it as well. The result was a valid Winamp skin!</p><p><img src="https://jordaneldredge.com/notion-mirror/84ebb48c-616a-4f51-ae9a-991a4e0a7e9b/4d300a93-0973-42bf-8eff-43d2b4b33d94/Screen_Shot_2021-01-19_at_4.12.13_PM.png" alt="" height="952" width="572"></p><p>Password was "nayane”.</p><p>I went ahead and uploaded the decrypted version <a href="https://jordaneldredge.com/a3ea435df7ab4f7fa106ed23644b0358/">here</a>.</p><hr><p>This got me interested in other “sensitive” things that might be included in skins, so I started searching for things like “password” inside the files <em>inside</em> all the Winamp skins.</p><p>I found one with a file called <code>E-mail passwords.txt</code> which contained… their email address and email password. Not great operational security.</p><hr><p><a href="https://skins.webamp.org/skin/bf47d3cee462143bb4549fee59f567b2/Marshall_Matters_Skin_2.wsz/">Another skin</a> contained a text file with hundreds of blank lines and then, at the very bottom, the text:</p><p><span><pre><p><code><span><span></span></span><br><span><span></span></span><br><span><span></span></span><br><span><span></span></span><br><span><span></span></span><br><span><span></span></span><br><span><span>YOU HAVE FOUND THE SUPRISE!!!</span></span><br><span><span>USE THIS PASSWORD:KEWL16</span></span></code></p></pre></span></p><p>Inside the skin was a file <code>Suprise!.zip</code> which was itself encrypted, but the password didn’t work!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <task-lists disabled="" sortable="">
    <div>
      <p dir="auto">It is possible to execute TypeScript files by setting the experimental flag <code>--experimental-strip-types</code>.<br>
Node.js will transpile TypeScript source code into JavaScript source code.<br>
During the transpilation process, no type checking is performed, and types are discarded.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Roadmap</h3>
<p dir="auto">Refs: <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="2408734753" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/nodejs/loaders/issues/217" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/nodejs/loaders/issues/217/hovercard" href="https://github.com/nodejs/loaders/issues/217">nodejs/loaders#217</a></p>
<h3 dir="auto">Motivation</h3>
<p dir="auto">I believe enabling users to execute TypeScript files is crucial to move the ecosystem forward, it has been requested on all the surveys, and it simply cannot be ignored. We must acknowledge users want to run <code>node foo.ts</code> without installing external dependencies or loaders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">There is a TC39 proposal for <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-type-annotations">type annotations</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 dir="auto">Why type stripping</h3>
<p dir="auto">Type stripping as the name suggest, means removing all the <code>types</code>,  transform the input in a JavaScript module.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const foo: string = &quot;foo&quot;;"><pre><span>const</span> <span>foo</span>: <span>string</span> <span>=</span> <span>"foo"</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Becomes:</p>

<p dir="auto">Other runtimes also perform transformation of some TypeScript only features into JavaScript, for example enums, which do not exists in JavaScript.<br>
At least initially in this PR no trasformation is performed, meaning that using <code>Enum</code>, <code>namespaces</code> etc... will not be possible.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Why I chose @swc/wasm-typescript</h3>
<p dir="auto">Because of <em>simplicity</em>.<br>
I have considered other tools but they require either rust or go to be added to the toolchain.<br>
<code>@swc/wasm-typescript</code> its a small package with a wasm and a js file to bind it.<br>
Swc is currently used by Deno for the same purpose, it's battle tested.<br>
In the future I see this being implemented in  <strong>native layer</strong>.<br>
Massive shoutout to <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/kdy1/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/kdy1">@kdy1</a> for releasing a swc version for us.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2>Current release <a href="https://landley.net/toybox/news.html">0.8.11</a> (April 8, 2024)</h2>
<hr>


<h2><a name="what">What is toybox?</a></h2><a name="what">

</a><p><a name="what">Toybox combines many common Linux command line utilities together into
a single </a><a href="http://landley.net/toybox/license.html">BSD-licensed</a> executable. It's simple, small, fast, and reasonably
standards-compliant (<a href="http://opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799">POSIX-2008</a> and <a href="http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/LSB_4.1.0">LSB 4.1</a>).</p>

<p>Toybox's main goal is to make Android
<a href="http://landley.net/aboriginal/about.html#selfhost">self-hosting</a>
by improving Android's command line utilities so it can
build an installable Android Open Source Project image
entirely from source under a stock Android system. After a talk at the 2013
Embedded Linux Conference explaining this plan
(<a href="http://landley.net/talks/celf-2013.txt">outline</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGmtP5Lg_t0">video</a>), Google
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/629362/">merged toybox into AOSP</a> and
began shipping toybox in Android Marshmallow in 2015.</p>

<p>Toybox aims to provide one quarter of a theoretical "minimal native
development environment", which is the simplest Linux system capable of
rebuilding itself from source code and then building
<a href="http://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs">Linux From Scratch</a>
and the <a href="https://source.android.com/">Android Open Source Project</a>
under the result. In theory, this should only require four packages:
1) a set of posix-ish command line utilities,

<p>A more recent talk from 2019 compares
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkJkyMuBm3g#t=1m18s">BusyBox vs toybox</a>
and explains the design decisions behind both.
(A 2015 toybox talk was part of the channel
<a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-embedded&amp;m=158159902514847&amp;w=2">accidentally deleted</a> off youtube by the Linux Foundation,
but the <a href="https://landley.net/talks/celf-2015.txt">outline</a> is
still available.)</p>

<b><h2><a name="context">What context was toybox created in?</a></h2></b><a name="context">

</a><p><a name="context">The toybox maintainer's previous minimal self-hosting system project,
</a><a href="http://landley.net/aboriginal/about.html">Aboriginal Linux</a>,
got a native development environment down to only seven packages in
its 1.0 release (busybox, uClibc, gcc, binutils, make, bash, and linux)
and then built Linux From Scratch under the result. That project
<a href="http://landley.net/aboriginal/history.html">was the reason</a>
toybox's maintainer became busybox maintainer, having done so
much work to extend busybox to replace all the gnu tools in a Linux From
Scratch build that the previous maintainer handed over the project (to
spend more time on buildroot).</p>

<p>Despite the maintainer's history with busybox, toybox is a fresh
from-scratch implementation under an
<a href="https://source.android.com/source/licenses.html">android-compatible</a>
<a href="http://landley.net/toybox/license.html">license</a>. Busybox predates Android, but has never
shipped with Android due to the license. As long as we're starting over anyway,
we can do a better job.</p>

<p>Toybox's current minimal native development environment builder is a new
<a href="https://github.com/landley/toybox/blob/master/scripts/mkroot.sh">tiny
implementation</a> integrated into the toybox source.
The "make root" target will create a simple toybox chroot
(by default in the root/host directory), and adding a LINUX= argument to
the make command line pointing to Linux kernel source code creates a tiny
bootable system with a wrapper script to run it under the emulator
<a href="https://qemu.org/">qemu</a>.</p>

<p>The list of commands remaining before we can build Linux From Scratch under
the result (with an appropriate
<a href="https://github.com/landley/toybox/blob/master/scripts/mcm-buildall.sh">compiler</a>)
is tracked <a href="http://landley.net/toybox/roadmap.html#dev_env">in
the roadmap</a>, and doing so is one of the main goals for toybox's 1.0
release.</p>

<p>Building LFS requres fewer commands than building AOSP, which has a lot more
<a href="http://source.android.com/source/initializing.html">build
prerequisites</a>. In theory some of those can be built from source
as external packages (we're clearly not including our own java implementation),
but some early prerequisites may need to be added to bootstrap AOSP far enough
to build them (such as a read-only version of "git":
how does repo download the AOSP source otherwise?)
<a name="2_back"></a><sup><span size="-3"><a href="#2">[2]</a></span></sup></p>

<b><h2><a name="status">What commands are planned/implemented in toybox?</a></h2></b><a name="status">

</a><p><a name="status">The current list of commands implemented by toybox is on the
</a><a href="http://landley.net/toybox/status.html">status page</a>, which is updated each release.
There is also a <a href="http://landley.net/toybox/roadmap.html">roadmap</a> listing all planned commands
for the 1.0 release and the reasons for including them.</p>

<p>In general, configuring toybox with "make defconfig" enables all the commands
compete enough to be useful. Configuring "allyesconfig" enables partially
implemented commands as well, along with debugging features.</p>

<b><h3>Relevant Standards</h3></b>

<p>Most commands are implemented according to POSIX-2008 (I.E.
<a href="http://opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/idx/utilities.html">The
Single Unix Specification version 4</a>) where applicable. This does not mean
that toybox is implementing every SUSv4 utility: some such as SCCS and ed are
obsolete, while others such as c99 are outside the scope of the project.
Toybox also isn't implementing full internationalization support: it should be
8-bit clean and handle UTF-8, but otherwise we leave this to X11 and higher
layers. And some things (like $CDPATH support in "cd") await a good
explanation of why to bother with them. (POSIX provides an important
frame of reference, but is not an infallable set of commandments to be blindly
obeyed. We do try to document our deviations from it in the comment section
at the start of each command under toys/posix.)</p>

<p>The other major sources of commands are the Linux man pages, the
Linux Standard Base, and testing the behavior of existing command
implementations (although not generally looking at their
source code), including the commands in Android's toolbox. SUSv4 does not
include many basic commands such as "mount", "init", and "mke2fs", which are
kind of nice to have.</p>

<p>For more on this see the <a href="http://landley.net/toybox/roadmap.html">roadmap</a> and
<a href="http://landley.net/toybox/design.html">design goals</a>.</p>

<b><h2><a name="downloads">Download</a></h2></b><a name="downloads">

</a><p><a name="downloads">This project is maintained as a </a><a href="https://github.com/landley/toybox">git
archive</a>, and also offers <a href="http://landley.net/toybox/downloads">source
tarballs</a> and <a href="http://landley.net/toybox/bin">static binaries</a>
of the release versions.</p>

<p>The maintainer's <a href="http://landley.net/notes.html">development log</a> and the project's
<a href="http://lists.landley.net/listinfo.cgi/toybox-landley.net">mailing
list</a> are also good ways to track what's going on with the project.</p>

<b><h2><a name="toycans">What's the toybox logo image?</a></h2></b><a name="toycans">

</a><p><a name="toycans">It's </a><a href="http://landley.net/toybox/toycans-big.jpg">carefully stacked soda cans</a>. Specifically,
it's a bunch of the original "Coke Zero" and "Pepsi One" cans, circa 2006,
stacked to spell out the binary values of the ascii string "Toybox", with
null terminator at the bottom. (The big picture's on it's side because
the camera was held sideways to get a better shot.)</p>

<p>No, it's not photoshopped, I actually had these cans until a coworker
who Totally Did Not Get It <sup><span size="-3"><a href="http://www.timesys.com/">tm</a></span></sup> threw them out one day after I'd gone home,
thinking they were recycling. (I still have two of each kind, but
Pepsi One seems discontinued and Coke Zero switched its can color
from black to grey, presumably in celebration. It was fun while it lasted...)</p>

<b><h2>Footnotes</h2></b>

<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#1_back">[1]</a> Ok, most toolchains (gcc, llvm, pcc, libfirm...)
are multiple packages, but the maintainer of toybox used to maintain a
<a href="http://landley.net/tinycc">fork of tinycc</a> (an integrated
compiler/assembler/linker which once upon a
time did <a href="http://bellard.org/tcc/tccboot.html">build a bootable linux
kernel</a> before its original developer abandoned the project),
and has <a href="http://landley.net/hg/qcc/file/tip/todo/todo.txt">vague plans</a> of <a href="http://landley.net/qcc">trying
again someday</a>. The compiler toolchain is _conceptually_ one package,
implementable as a single multicall binary acting like make, cc, as, ld, cpp,
strip, readelf, nm, objdump, and so on as necessary. It's just the existing
packages that do this <strike>kinda suck</strike> don't. (In theory "make"
belongs in qcc, in practice llvm hasn't got its own make so toybox probably
needs to add it after 1.0 to eliminate another gpl build prerequite from
AOSP.)</p>

<p><a name="2"></a><a href="#2_back">[2]</a>
The dividing line is
"Is there an acceptably licensed version Android can ship, or do we have
to write one?" Since android is not "GNU/Linux" in any way, we need to
clean out all traces of gnu software from its build to get a clean
self-hosting system.</p>

The project went on for some years and finally led to<!-- --> <a href="https://sudoku.tn1ck.com/">sudoku.tn1ck.com</a> - a free and<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/TN1ck/super-sudoku">open source</a> Sudoku app without any tracking. While working on it, I went down the rabbit hole of generating Sudokus of a specified "human perceived" difficulty and accidentally created a quite thorough analysis of it.</p><h2>Creating a Sudoku solver</h2><p>First things first, to generate a Sudoku, we first have to solve one. The solver plays an integral part in the generation part, as we will use the iterations it needed to solve a Sudoku to measure the difficulty.</p><p>We will explore multiple algorithms and benchmark them against each other in how well we can use them to measure the difficulty of a Sudoku. We start with the most basic brute force algorithm and end up with the final one, based on seeing the Sudoku as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (short CSP). We use a depth-first search (short DFS) for all our different strategies here. We abstract this by the following function. We make it Sudoku specific instead of completely generic for ease of use.</p><div><p>+ </p><!-- --><p>Code of the depth-first search</p></div><div><p>Brute force version</p><p>Brute force version</p><div><p>This is the most simple strategy to solve the Sudoku: We find an empty spot and fill in a number between 1 - 9. We don’t do anything else. This is horribly slow; do not try this at home.</p><div><p><label for="timeout">Time between each step (ms)</label></p></div><div><p>+ </p><!-- --><p>Code of the brute force strategy</p></div></div></div><div><p>Skip on invalid Sudokus</p><p>Skip on invalid Sudokus</p><div><p>The simplest and most substantial change we can do is not waiting until the whole Sudoku is filled but skipping on the Sudokus that are already invalid. This solver will solve even the hardest Sudokus in adequate time, but it still wastes a lot of cycles as it is not choosing the cell to fill with a value with any strategy.</p><div><p><label for="timeout">Time between each step (ms)</label></p></div><div><p>+ </p><!-- --><p>Code of the improved brute force</p></div></div></div><div><p>Minimum remaining value</p><p>Minimum remaining value</p><div><p>"Minimum remaining value" is a heuristic we can use to not search blindly, but to select the cell next with the least amount of possibilities. This is something a human would do as well - fill or work on the cells with the least options. This greatly reduces the number of iterations needed for the difficult Sudoku. This algorithm is pretty solid now as it can solve even the hardest Sudokus in the millisecond range.</p><div><p><label for="timeout">Time between each step (ms)</label></p></div><div><p>+ </p><!-- --><p>Code of the minimum remaining value strategy</p></div></div></div><div><p>Arc Consistency</p><p>Arc Consistency</p><div><p>We now embark on a different way to solve the Sudoku, namely framing it as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem to solve it and then use Arc Consistency to simplify the problem. A quick primer on some computer science terms.</p><ul><li><strong>Domain</strong> - A domain is the set of possible values for a variable. For a Sudoku, this is the numbers 1 - 9.</li><li><strong>CSP</strong> - A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a problem defined by a set of variables, a set of domains, and a set of constraints. The goal is to assign a value to each variable such that the constraints are satisfied. For a Sudoku, the variables are the cells, the domains are the numbers 1 - 9, and the constraints are that every row, column, and square has to have unique numbers.</li><li><strong>Arc consistency</strong> - A variable is arc-consistent with another variable if every value in the domain of the first variable has a possible value in the domain of the second variable that satisfies the constraint between the two variables.<br>In the Sudoku example, if we have two cells in the same row, one with the domain [1, 2, 3] and the other with the domain [2], this is not arc consistent as 2 is in the domain of the first cell. If we remove the 2 from the domain of the first cell, it becomes arc consistent.</li><li><strong>AC3</strong> - The AC3 algorithm is an algorithm to create arc consistency. The main difference from the complete naive way to achieve arc consistency is that we do not loop over all constraints again when a domain of a variable changes, but only the relevant variables that have a constraint with it (in Sudoku the cells in the same row/column/square).</li></ul><p>For every cell in the Sudoku, we keep track of its possible values. We reduce the possible values for every cell by checking the Sudoku constraints e.g. remove the numbers that are already in the same row/column/square. We do this as long until no domain is changing anymore. This "reduction of domains using the constraints" is arc consistency.</p><p>For very simple Sudokus, this is already enough to solve one (see the applet below), for harder ones, we are left with multiple options for every unfilled cell. This means we have to employ a search again. We use then the "Minimum remaining value" strategy again to select the cell with the least options and create new versions of the Sudoku with that cell filled with the possible values. This is called "domain splitting" in fancy computer science terms. We again count the number of iterations needed to solve the Sudoku.</p><p>The applet shows the domains of the applied AC3 algorithm in unfilled cells. If a Sudoku cannot be solved, one domain will become empty, which is shown as red, then the algorithm will backtrack.</p><div><p><label for="timeout">Time between each step (ms)</label></p></div><div><p>+ </p><!-- --><p>Code of the Arc consistency strategy</p></div></div></div><h3>Rating the difficulty of Sudokus</h3><p>The main problem that one faces when generating a Sudoku is to assign the difficulty rating for a human solver. As we don’t want to manually verify every Sudoku we generate, we need an automatic way for us to group a newly generated Sudoku according to its difficulty. All our Sudoku solvers yield an iteration count, which we will use as our cost function. I'm relying here on the paper "Rating and generating Sudoku puzzles based on constraint satisfaction problems." by Fatemi, Bahare, Seyed Mehran Kazemi, and Nazanin Mehrasa.<br>In the paper, they download Sudokus of each difficulty section from websudoku.com, solve them by <s>students</s> volunteers, and then run their algorithm on it. They then took the average of each category and so they got an iteration-to-difficulty mapping.</p><p>We will do basically the same, but actually publish the data and also try out how the "lesser" strategies work here for rating the difficulty. I fetched 100 Sudokus from websudoku.com (easy, medium, hard, evil) for each of its difficulty classes as well as from sudoku.com (easy, medium, hard, expert, master, extreme).</p><h3>How well do the solvers measure human difficulty?</h3><p>I'm not a data scientist, so take this analysis with a grain of salt, and I'm happy for any comments/proposals on how to improve it. As I don't have comments here yet, you can open an issue at<!-- --> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/TN1ck/sudoku-analysis">the GitHub repository of this analysis</a> <!-- -->instead.</p><p>This is the raw data on how many iterations each solver took to solve the Sudokus. You can also execute it yourself<!-- --> <a href="https://tn1ck.com/apps/benchmark-sudokus">here </a> or look at the source<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/TN1ck/tn1ck.com/blob/main/pages/apps/benchmark-sudokus.tsx">at GitHub</a>. I skipped the most simple brute force, as it would take ages to compute even medium difficult Sudokus.</p><p><strong>For all the charts, I used the logarithm on the iterations as especially the qq plot made it very obvious that the iterations count is exponential to the difficulty.</strong> <!-- -->Which is not surprising as solving Sudokus is famously NP hard. Any currently known algorithms to solve an NP-hard problem take exponential time.</p><div><p>Histograms</p><p>Histograms</p><div><p>First let's draw a histogram of each strategy and each dataset to get an idea of the distribution. From that, we can see that they seem to be more or less normally distributed (with the applied logarithm), especially the brute force algorithm.<br>Both the minimum remaining value and arc consistency algorithm look the same, but only for the more difficult levels as for the easy ones, they always need the same number of iterations.</p><div><p><img src="https://tn1ck.com/how-to-generate-sudokus/benchmark_bruteForceWithValidCheck.csv_histograms.png"></p></div></div></div><div><p>QQ plots</p><p>QQ plots</p><div><p>Then we look at the QQ plots for each strategy/source/level combination. QQ plots are super cool to get an intuitive understanding of how the values are distributed. A perfect normal distribution would be a straight line. These lines also look pretty straight, but only because we used the logarithm on the iterations count already. For the minimum remaining value and arc consistency, the lower difficulty levels look much less like a straight line, but the higher difficulty levels look very much like it. This is explained with their very low iteration count for the easy Sudokus.</p><div><p><img src="https://tn1ck.com/how-to-generate-sudokus/benchmark_bruteForceWithValidCheck.csv_qq_plots.png"></p></div></div></div><div><p>Correlation</p><p>Correlation</p><div><p>We can already see that these graphs all look somewhat alike, even the second most basic brute force looks decently similar to our fancy CSP algorithm. But do the numbers agree? How much do the iterations correlate with the level?</p><div><p><img src="https://tn1ck.com/how-to-generate-sudokus/benchmark_bruteForceWithValidCheck.csv_correlation.png"></p></div><p>As we can see, they all correlate almost perfectly with the brute force having a perfect 1.0 correlation, making it highly likely that the websites use the iteration count as well for their level determination - and this makes the whole analysis problematic, as we still don't know if this is actually a good difficulty indicator for how a human perceives the difficulty. Actually solving Sudokus by a human and rating them by the time to get a ground truth is left as an exercise for the reader (Sorry I'm not paid for this.)</p></div></div><div><p>Generating a Sudoku with a specific difficulty</p><p>Generating a Sudoku with a specific difficulty</p><div><p>To now generate a Sudoku of a specific difficulty, we do the following:</p><ol><li>Start with an empty grid and fill it with random numbers until it is a valid (and unique) Sudoku. We backtrack when the added number will lead to a non-solvable Sudoku. Note: The uniqueness constraint comes automatically as we continue to fill the Sudoku with numbers.

Here is how they describe the algorithm:</p><blockquote>"We use hill climbing to generate new puzzles having a call count close to the call count we need. In this method, first of all, we generate an initial puzzle with some random numbers inside it and calculate its cost function. Then in each iteration, we randomly change one element of this solution by adding, deleting, or changing a single number and calculate the cost function again.<br>After this, we check the new value of the cost function for this new puzzle and compare it to the previous one. If the cost is reduced, we accept the second puzzle as the new solution and otherwise, we undo the change. We do this process until meeting the stopping criterion.<br>The cost function for a given puzzle is infinity for puzzles with none or more than one solution. For other puzzles, the cost is the absolute value of the current puzzle’s call count minus the average call count of the given difficulty level. For example, if we want to generate an easy puzzle and we want to consider the values demonstrated in Table I, then the cost function for a puzzle having a unique solution is the absolute value of its call count minus 6.234043.<br>We stop the algorithm when we have puzzles with costs close to zero. Depending on the level of accuracy we need and the number of difficulty levels we have, we can define the closeness of the cost function to zero."</blockquote><p>When I first read it, I thought "we generate an initial puzzle with some random numbers inside it" would mean that I could literally start with a Sudoku grid and put random numbers in it.<br>But one needs an already valid Sudoku as else the hill climbing will not work as the cost function for an invalid configuration should return infinite. While theoretically it still works, it takes far too long to stumble upon a valid configuration like this.</p><p>I’m not entirely sure if they meant to start with a valid Sudoku, but "initial puzzle with some random numbers" does not sound like it. Furthermore, "just adding, deleting, or changing a single number" is not efficient, as again, this can lead to an invalid configuration quickly, albeit the hill climbing will take care of that if you were in a valid configuration before.</p><p>I find my algorithm to be more efficient and elegant as it is guided by the Sudoku's constraints, namely we first create a solvable and unique Sudoku, making the hill climbing afterwards easier as our cost function will not return infinity. Their algorithm will spend most of their time trying to stumble upon a valid Sudoku.</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ericwbailey.website/published/dungeons-and-dragons-taught-me-how-to-write-alt-text/">https://ericwbailey.website/published/dungeons-and-dragons-taught-me-how-to-write-alt-text/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41061755">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I played a lot of <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">the pen-and-paper roleplaying game</a> in high school and college. I’m now conceptually more into <a href="https://dungeon-world.com/">Dungeon World</a>’s approach, but I digress.</p>
<p>Unlike Tom Hanks, I avoided turning into a <a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/tom-hanks-film-debut-was-a-drama-about-dungeons-dragons/">delusional murderer</a>. Instead, I deepened some friendships, had a lot of big laughs, learned some cool vocabulary, and had an indirect introduction to systems design. Importantly, I also annoyed the hell out of my high school principal.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with Dungeons &amp; Dragons, there are two general flavors for how to play:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using miniatures and a map, or</li>
<li>Theater of the mind.</li>
</ol>
<p>We elected for theater of the mind more often than not. This was mostly because the rule books by themselves were expensive enough, and my friends and I were lower middle class.</p>
<p>Theater of the mind play means that the entire game is conducted verbally. The sole exception is your character sheet, which is a text and number-based armature you build the rest of your character from.</p>
<p>The narrative is shared amongst everyone by talking. The aesthetics of the game exist entirely in each player’s mind, and not communicated via moving little figures around on a map.</p>
<p>You can probably guess where this post is going now.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you%2C-random-dragon-magazine-issue">Thank you, random Dragon Magazine issue</h2>
<p>Because I cannot <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/half-ass">half-ass</a> anything, I went hard on immersing myself in the culture surrounding Dungeons and Dragons. This included subscribing to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_(magazine)">Dragon magazine</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t remember the issue number, or the original author. However, I do remember it was from an advice column. The problem was the person who was running the game wanting to enliven his descriptions, as they felt like their narration was both boring and confusing.</p>
<p>The advice for that problem was spectacular, and it boiled down to <strong>describing the most important thing first</strong>.</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A large room with rough stone walls. Brownish moss clings to the walls, and trickles of brackish water also flow down parts of it. Broken furniture is scattered across on the floor. The ceiling is so high that you cannot see it. Also, there is a large red dragon attacking you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know about you, but I’d want to know about the red dragon’s presence and activity a lot more than the quality of the masonry. There’s also another odd bit of putting too much detail on the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Let’s rephrase it:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A huge dragon the color of a smoldering coal is attacking you! It is rearing its snake-like neck up to strike, head poised underneath a ceiling that is so high you cannot see it. Its dull black, iron-like claws dig into the floor of the rough stone room as it prepares to lunge at you. Broken furniture is scattered about, no doubt victims of previous altercations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve put the most important thing first. We then <strong>supply detail in an order that aids in understanding the main point</strong>, and discard information that is irrelevant to the overall concept we’re trying to communicate and mood we’re trying to evoke.</p>
<p>We now know:</p>
<ol>
<li>There’s a big dragon, and it’s seriously pissed off,</li>
<li>There’s ample room for it to move around,</li>
<li>It can, and has previously made good on its threats, and that</li>
<li>There’s not a lot of places to take cover.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is explicit prioritization of information. It also demonstrates that informative information can also be entertaining.</p>
<h2 id="context%2C-context%2C-context">Context, context, context</h2>
<p>Observant readers may also note I’ve added some emotion with the exclamation point, as well as adding some more flowery language into the mix.</p>
<p>Alternative text descriptions (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/alt">alt text</a>) are as much an art as much as they are a science.</p>
<p>A red dragon attack is <strong>a significant event</strong>, so additional detail and emotion helps. I feel confident in both editorializing the experience as well as punching it up, given that the larger goal is to communicate a frenetic, action-packed encounter.</p>
<p>The same also applies in reverse. <strong>Smaller, more succinct descriptions can be equally helpful</strong> in situations where the content is not a major contributor of the overall thing you’re trying to communicate.</p>
<p>In Dungeons &amp; Dragons this is a bit of an in-joke. Over-describing something trivial can lead to your players fixating on it, completely derailing the plot as they try and uncover the secrets behind something mundane that you had no pre-formulated plans for.</p>
<p>This is why you want to go with this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A worn, wooden mug full of cheap ale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A stout mug crafted from reclaimed lumber. It is poorly stained and worn smooth from years of heavy use. Twin iron bands are placed at the top and bottom, equally as worn and giving it a comfortable heft. A thin, frothy ale has been poured into it, smelling weakly of hops and strongly of alcohol. A single rivulet of ale pours down the side of the mug to stain the bar top the mug is placed on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, it’s a great description, but also not the point. The point is you’re in a seedy pub chasing down rumors about a goblin who somehow got its grubby little hands on a powerful magic artifact.</p>
<p>For alt text, we want to also consider the larger context of <strong>what you’re trying to communicate</strong>, <strong>why</strong>, and <strong>if the detail you provide helps that effort to communicate</strong>.</p>
<p>Consider the difference between a small badge that indicates a product has been recently-added to the storefront:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>New!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://x.com/NASA/status/1552750698114187269">this Tweet from NASA</a> showcasing a photo from the James Webb telescope:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A dramatic blade made of red gaseous wisps comes down top-to-bottom in the center of the image as smaller green wisps feather out in horizontal directions. A bright star shrouded in blue light is near the center of the bow-like blade. Blue dots in different sizes dot the background of the image, signifying neighboring stars.⁣</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="tone-and-mood">Tone and mood</h2>
<p>These two concepts are the bread and butter of a roleplaying game experience. Consider:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The vizier prattles on, clearly in love with the sound of their own voice. Meanwhile, the rest of the court slumps—bored, exasperated, and succumbing to the stifling heat of the high summer. They are taking their cue from the sultan, some nakedly jealous of the cushioned throne he is slowly nodding off on.</p>
  <p>In the desperation of scanning the room to find something more interesting to look at, you catch the unblinking gaze of the court jester. His stare makes you feel like a butterfly pinned to a specimen spreading board. The room begins to slowly fade to black as you continue to lock eyes. A subtle foxfire aura begins to shimmer around his frame, while a placeless humming sound gets louder and louder. The heat of the room is forgotten as a chill runs down your spine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A white woman with short blue hair smirks at the camera and raises a glass to it. Her drink is a margarita, and the glass is beaded with sweat from the heat of the day. She is wearing a loose white shirt, and oversized red sunglasses are perched perfectly on her head. Her hair is slightly frizzy from the humidity, but her expression clearly communicates that she is unbothered by it. It is the golden hour, and the sun casts a warm, hazy amber glow on her skin. The table she is sitting at is wooden and well-worn. Behind her is a busy street, a blur of people going about their day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of these descriptions are <strong>evocative</strong>.</p>
<p>As the author of both experiences I am trying to not only:</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe what is physically present, but also</li>
<li>How all the qualities add up as a suggestion for how to feel when taken in as a composite whole.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the roleplaying game description, I am injecting an immediate sense of fear and menace into an otherwise boring situation. For the image description, I am I am creating a sense of relaxation and contentment.</p>
<p>Additionally, the introduction of the vizier may seem contradictory when compared to the dragon on a first read through. Remember that this is <strong>an editorialized experience</strong>.</p>
<p>The most important thing in this scene is the feelings of shock and fear when something unexpected and unsettling interrupts the mundane. In order to create that feeling, we need to first establish the humdrum experience of an boring, endless meeting in a stifling room.</p>
<h2 id="the-user-experience-of-assistive-technology">The user experience of assistive technology</h2>
<p>Another reason why I advocate for describing the most important thing first is because of how screen readers announce alt text. A screen reader will read it in a linear order, starting from the first word in the string and ending with the last.</p>
<p>Unlike other web content, there isn’t really any other special way screen readers can work with alt text strings—short of increasing or decreasing the speaking rate. This is also why things like bolding, italicizing, links, and paragraphs aren’t allowed.</p>
<p>Another important thing to know about screen readers is that they have dedicated keyboard commands to make them <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/userGuide.html#StartingAndStoppingNVDA">pause or stop announcing</a>. There are a few use cases for this behavior, but the most common one is, “Yup, I got it. Shut up now.”</p>
<p>Placing helpful, but ultimately non-critical information after the most important thing <strong>lets the person using the screen reader decide when they know enough to get what they need</strong>. It also saves them from wasting time re-listening to superfluous information if re-navigating to the image to glean some important detail (“Oh, what was the subject of that painting again?”).</p>
<h2 id="remember%2C-you-control-the-narrative">Remember, you control the narrative</h2>
<p>The person who runs the game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons has a responsibility to provide an entertaining and memorable experience for the other participants.</p>
<p><strong>You wield power as the person enabling and facilitating the experiences others have</strong>. This applies to roleplaying games as well as writing alt text.</p>
<p>This is why I believe <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/06/img-alt-attribute-alternate-description-decorative/">most contemporary images on the web are not decorative</a>. It’s also why I think it’s important to <a href="https://tink.uk/thoughts-on-skin-tone-and-text-descriptions.md-notes-on-synthetic-speech/">include details like race, gender, and ethnicity</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to acknowledge this fact. For roleplaying games, it <a href="https://startplaying.games/blog/posts/tabletop-consent-guide-cj-mccullough">centers around <strong>consent</strong></a>. For alt text, it centers around <strong>autonomy</strong>.</p>
<p>We want to ensure that people who cannot see the image have <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/images.html#general-guidelines">the capability to understand it the same way as someone who can</a>. There is a huge amount of power in this act.</p>
<h2 id="skills-you-can-cultivate">Skills you can cultivate</h2>
<p>A decent amount of people are uncomfortable the first time they play a roleplaying game. Acting out a character in front of others can feel strange at first, but is also a feeling that passes the more you do it.</p>
<p>The same applies for writing alt text. The more often you practice it, the better you get at it.</p>
<p>The grim reality is <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/#alttext">the state of alt text on the web leaves a lot to be desired</a>. That said, writing it can be a joy and an art. If you’re looking for a new adventure to start, here are some resources that can help you on your quest:</p>
