<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Mozilla closed out 2023 with a report that dodges its flatlining browser market share and Mozilla.social beta in favor of calls for a faster pace from its highly paid CEO.</p>
<p>According to the company's filings, Mitchell Baker's compensation went from $5,591,406 <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://assets.mozilla.net/annualreport/2021/mozilla-fdn-990-ty21-public-disclosure.pdf">in 2021</a> [PDF] to $6,903,089 <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://assets.mozilla.net/annualreport/2022/mozilla-fdn-990-ty22-public-disclosure.pdf">in 2022</a> [PDF]. It's quite the jump considering that revenues declined from $527,585,000 to $510,389,000 in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://assets.mozilla.net/annualreport/2022/mozilla-fdn-2022-fs-final-0908.pdf">the same period</a> [PDF].</p>
<p>Despite the executive payout, Firefox continues to trail Google and even Microsoft in desktop browser market share. While it has not suffered any catastrophic losses, neither has it made any significant gains.</p>

    

<p>Baker, however, would very much like to speed things up and says in the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://stateof.mozilla.org/#">State of Mozilla report</a>: "The pace is not enough, the impact is not enough."</p>

        


        

<p>Unsurprisingly for a technology company, the report is heavy on AI going mainstream where Mozilla reckons it can make an impact in the technology, particularly with regard to open source developers and privacy.</p>
<p>Mozilla's adventures in AI? The organization says it has 15 engineers working on open source large language models and is working on use cases in the healthcare space. Moez Draief, managing director of Mozilla.ai, said: "There's a lot of structured data work in that industry that will feed the language models; we don't have to invent it."</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/21/mozilla_decides_trusted_types_is/">Mozilla decides Trusted Types is a worthy security feature</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/20/firefox_121_released/">Penguins get their Wayland with Firefox 121</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/21/ad_block_google/">Firefox slow to load YouTube? Just another front in Google's war on ad blockers</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/15/google_amazon_microsoft_mozilla/">Google, Amazon, Microsoft make the Mozilla naughty list for Christmas shopping</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Earlier this year, Mozilla had to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/06/mozilla_ai_explain_shift/">hit pause on its AI chatbot</a> after the service served up a worrying amount of nonsense in response to user queries.</p>
<p>Chief product officer Steve Teixeira notes in the report the rapid growth of AI and social networks, although warns that Mozilla.social is unlikely to move beyond the experimentation phase in 2024. He says that Mozilla would be "exploring ways to better integrate advertising while adhering to our focus on privacy and choice," including web browsing.</p>

        

<p>Teixeira also acknowledged subscription services such as Mozilla VPN and Relay.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how Mozilla picks up the pace in 2024. As well as Teixeira's comments regarding advertising, Baker notes: "We need to be faster in prototyping, launching, learning, and iterating ... This requires rich data, and so we will be moving in that direction, but in a very Mozilla way."</p>
<p>Surely not slurping telemetry?</p>

        

<p>According to the report, the "Mozilla way" is all about privacy, encryption, and keeping customer data safe. Hopefully, it will also be about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/29/mozilla_asleep_at_wheel/">innovation</a> rather than scattering AI fairy dust over its product line.

      <h3>Browsers are the most likely disruptor of the mobile duopoly but you'd never know it reading Wired or The Verge.</h3>
      
    </header>
    <p>The tech news is chockablock<sup><a href="#fn-recent-antitrust-news-1" id="fnref-recent-antitrust-news-1">[1]</a></sup> with <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/owa-2023-review/">antitrust rumblings and slow-motion happenings.</a> Through eagle-eyed press coverage, regulatory reports, and legal discovery the shady dealings of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206400/apple-tax-amazon-tv-prime-30-percent-developers">Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/30/23923533/google-explains-why-some-developers-were-able-to-get-away-with-paying-less-on-play">Google's</a> app stores are now comprehensively documented and pressure for change has built to an unsustainable level. Something's gotta give.</p>
<p>This is the backdrop to the biggest app store story nobody is writing about: on pain of <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2349#:~:text=In%20case%20a,systemic%20non%2Dcompliance.">steep fines,</a> gatekeepers are opening up to competing browsers. This, in turn, will enable competitors to replace app stores with directories of <a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/">Progressive Web Apps</a>. Capable browsers that <a href="https://patrickbrosset.com/articles/2023-09-26-my-first-tpac-conference/#:~:text=The%20Web%20Applications,was%20also%20reviewed.">expose</a> web app installation and powerful features to developers can kickstart app portability, breaking open the mobile duopoly.</p>
<p>But you'd never know it reading Wired or The Verge.</p>

<p>With shockingly few <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/09/apple_app_store/">exceptions,</a> coverage of app store regulation that the answer to crummy, extractive native app stores is other native app stores. This unexamined framing shapes hundreds of pieces covering regulatory events, including <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-commentary/internet-future-about-to-get-weird-1234938403/">by web-friendly authors.</a> The tech press almost universally fails to mention the web as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_good">substitute</a> for native apps and fail to inform readers of its potential to disrupt app stores.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/the-open-web-is-good-actually-9683c692df84#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAn%20app%20is%20just%20a%20web%2Dpage%20wrapped%20in%20enough%20IP%20to%20make%20it%20a%20crime%20to%20defend%20yourself%20against%20corporate%20predation%E2%80%9D">Cory Doctorow observed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An app is just a web-page wrapped in enough IP to make it a crime to defend yourself against corporate predation."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The implication is clear: browsers unchained can do to mobile what the web did to desktop, where more than 70% of daily "jobs to be done" happen on the web.</p>
<p>Replacing mobile app stores will look different than the web's path to desktop centrality, but the enablers are waiting in the wings. It has gone largely unreported that <a href="https://web.dev/explore/progressive-web-apps">Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)</a> have been held back by Apple and Google denying competing browsers access to essential APIs.<sup><a href="#fn-convergent-agendas-2" id="fnref-convergent-agendas-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thankfully, regulators haven't been waiting on the press to explain the situation. Recent interventions into mobile ecosystems include requirements to repair browser choice, and the analysis backing those regulations takes into account the web's role as a potential competitor (e.g., <a href="https://www.jftc.go.jp/file/230327EN_Summary.pdf">Japan's JFTC (pdf)</a>).</p>
<p>Regulators seem to understand that:</p>
<ul>
<li>App stores protect proprietary ecosystems through preferential discovery and capabilities.</li>
<li>Stores then extract rents from developers dependent on commodity capabilities duopolists provide only through proprietary APIs.</li>
<li>App portability threatens the proprietary agenda of app stores.</li>
<li>The web can interrupt this model by bringing portability to apps and over-the-top discovery through search. This has yet to happen because...</li>
<li>The duopolists, in different ways, have kneecapped competing browsers along with their own, keeping the web from contesting the role of app stores.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple and Google saw what the web did to desktop, and they've laid roadblocks to the competitive forces that would let history repeat on smartphones.</p>
<h2 id="the-buried-lede">The Buried Lede <a href="#the-buried-lede">#</a></h2>
<p>The web's potential to disrupt mobile is evident to regulators, <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/">advocates</a>, and developers. So why does the tech news fail to explain the situation?</p>
<p>Consider <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/231226/p14#a231226p14">just one</a> of the many antitrust events of recent months. It was covered by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/28/24017565/japan-plans-to-crack-down-on-apple-and-google-app-stores">The Verge</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/japan-preparing-eu-style-law/">Mac Rumors</a>, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/12/26/japan-plans-to-fine-apple-over-app-stores-and-antitrust-issues">Apple Insider</a>, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38773429">more.</a></p>
<p>None of the linked articles note browser competition's potential to upend app stores. Browsers unshackled have the potential to free businesses from build-it-twice proprietary ecosystems, end rapacious app store taxes, pave the way for new OS entrants â all without the valid security concerns side-loading introduces.</p>
<p>Lest you think this an isolated incident, <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230820/p8#a230820p8">this article on the impact of the EU's DMA</a> lacks any hint of the web's potential to unseat app stores. You can repeat this trick with <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/search/query?q=EU+DMA&amp;wm=false"><em>any</em> DMA story from the past year</a>. Or spot-check <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/230201/p11#a230201p11">coverage</a> of the <a href="https://www.ntia.gov/report/2023/competition-mobile-app-ecosystem">NTIA's February report.</a></p>
<p>Reporters are "covering" these stories in the lightest sense of the word. Barrels of virtual ink has been spilt documenting unfair app store terms, conditions, and competition. And yet.</p>
<h2 id="disruption-disrupted">Disruption Disrupted <a href="#disruption-disrupted">#</a></h2>
<p>In an industry obsessed with "disruption," why is this David vs. Goliath story going untold? Some theories, in no particular order.</p>
<p>First, Mozilla <a href="https://infrequently.org/2020/06/platform-adjacency-theory/#the-committee-to-cast-the-web-in-amber">isn't advocating for a web that can challenge native apps,</a> and none of the other major browser vendors are telling the story either. Apple and Google have no interest in seeing their lucrative proprietary platforms supplanted, and Microsoft (your narrator's employer) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/24/23930478/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-mobile-windows-phone">famously lacks sustained mobile focus.</a></p>
<p>Next, it's hard to overlook that tech reporters live like wealthy people, iPhones and all. From that vantage point, it's often news that the web is <a href="https://fugu-tracker.web.app/">significantly more capable</a> on other OSes (never mind that they spend much of every day working in a desktop browser). It's hard to report on the potential of something you can't see for yourself.</p>
<p>Also, this might all be Greek. Reporters and editors aren't software engineers, so the potential of browser competition can remain understandably opaque. Stories that include mention of "alternative app stores" generally fail to mention that these stores may not be as safe, or that OS restrictions on features won't disappear just because of a different distribution mechanism, or that the security track records of the <em>existing</em> duopolist app stores are sketchy at best. Under these conditions, it's asking a lot to expect details-based discussion of alternatives, given the many technical wrinkles. Hopefully, <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/">someone can walk them through it.</a></p>
<p>Further, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contestable_market">market contestability theory</a> has only recently become a big part of the tech news beat. Regulators have been writing reports to convey their understanding of the market, and to shape effective legislation that will unchain the web, but smart folks unversed in both antitrust and browser minutiae might need help to pick up what regulators are putting down.</p>
<p>Lastly, it hasn't happened yet. Yes, <a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/">Progressive Web Apps</a> have been around for a few years, but they haven't had an impact on the iPhones that reporters and their circles almost universally carry. It's much easier to get folks to cover stories that directly affect them, and this is one that, so far, largely hasn't.</p>
<h2 id="green-shoots">Green Shoots <a href="#green-shoots">#</a></h2>
<p>The seeds of web-based app store dislocation have already been sown, but the chicken-and-egg question at the heart of platform competition looms.</p>
<p>On the technology side, Apple has been <a href="https://infrequently.org/2021/04/progress-delayed/">enormously successful at denying essential capabilities to the web</a> through a strategy of compelled monoculture combined with strategic foot-dragging.</p>

<p>As an example, the <a href="https://infrequently.org/2023/02/safari-16-4-is-an-admission/">eight-year delay</a> in implementing Push Notifications for the web<sup><a href="#fn-checkbox-compliance-3" id="fnref-checkbox-compliance-3">[3]</a></sup> kept many businesses from giving the web a second thought. If they couldn't re-engage users at the same rates as native apps, the web might as well not exist on phones. This logic has played out on a loop over the last decade, category-by-category, with gatekeepers preventing competing browsers from bringing capabilities to web apps that would let them supplant app stores<sup><a href="#fn-convergent-agendas-2" id="fnref-convergent-agendas-2:1">[2:1]</a></sup> while simultaneously keeping them from being discovered through existing stores.</p>
<p>Proper browser choice could upend this situation, finally allowing the web to provide "table stakes" features in a compelling way. For the first time, developers could bring the modern web's full power to wealthy mobile users, enabling the "write once, test everywhere" vision, and cut out the app store middleman â all without sacrificing essential app features or undermining security.</p>
<p>Sunsetting the 30% tax requires a compelling alternative, and Apple's simultaneous underfunding of Safari and compelled adoption of its underpowered engine have interlocked to keep the web out of the game. No wonder Apple is massively funding lobbyists, lawyers, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-19/apple-flexes-muscle-as-quiet-power-behind-app-developer-group">astroturf groups</a> to keep engine diversity at bay while belatedly <a href="https://infrequently.org/2023/02/safari-16-4-is-an-admission/">battening the hatches</a>.</p>
<p>On the business side, managers think about "mobile" as a category. Rather than digging into the texture of iOS, Android, and the differing web features available on each, businesses tend to bulk accept or reject the app store model. One sub-segment of "mobile" growing the ability to route around highway robbery Ts &amp; Cs is tantalising, but not enough to change the game; the web, like other metaplatforms, is only a disruptive force when pervasive and capable.<sup><a href="#fn-self-censorship-4" id="fnref-self-censorship-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>A prohibition on store discovery for web apps has buttressed Apple's denial of essential features to browsers:</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/trusted-web-activity">Google's answer to web apps in Play is a dog's breakfast</a>, but it <em>does</em> at least exist for developers willing to put in the effort, or for teams savvy enough to reach for <a href="https://www.pwabuilder.com/">PWA Builder.</a></p>
<p>Recent developments also point to a competitive future for capable web apps.</p>
<p>First, browser engine choice should become a reality on iOS in the EU in 2024, thanks to the plain language of the DMA. Apple will, of course, attempt to delay the entry of competing browsers through as-yet-unknown strategies, but the clock is ticking. Once browsers can enable capable web apps with easier distribution, the logic of the app store loses a bit of its lustre.</p>
<p>Work is also underway to give competing browsers a <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/WebInstall/explainer_cross_domain.md">chance to facilitate PWAs that can install other PWAs.</a> Web App Stores would then become a real possibility through browsers that support them, and we should expect that regulatory and legislative interventions will facilitate this in the near future. Removed from the need to police security (browsers have that covered) and handle distribution (websites update themselves), PWA app stores like <a href="https://store.app/">store.app</a> can become honest-to-goodness app management surfaces that can safely facilitate discovery and sync.</p>

  PWA app stores like <a href="https://appsco.pe/" target="_new">Appscope</a> and <a href="https://store.app/">store.app</a> exist, but they're hobbled by gatekeepers that have denied competing browsers access to APIs that could turn PWA directories into real contenders.

<p>It's no surprise that Apple and Google have kept private the APIs needed to make this better future possible. They built the necessary infrastructure for the web to disrupt native, then kept it to themselves. This potential has remained locked away within organisations politically hamstrung by native app store agendas. But all of that is about to change.</p>
<p>This begs the question: where's the coverage? This is the most exciting moment in more than 15 years for the web vs. native story, but the tech press is whiffing it.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-hope">A New Hope <a href="#a-new-hope">#</a></h2>
<p>2024 will be packed to the gills with app store and browser news, from implementation of the DMA, to the UK's renewed push into mobile browsers and cloud gaming, to new legislation arriving in many jurisdictions, to the first attempts at shipping iOS ports of Blink and Gecko browsers. Each event is a chance to inform the public about the already-raging battle for the future of the phone.</p>
<p>It's still possible to reframe these events and provide better context. We need a fuller discussion about what it will mean for mobile OSes to have competing native app stores when the underlying OSes are foundationally insecure. There are also existing examples of ecosystems with this sort of choice (e.g., China), and more needs to be written about the implications for users and developers. Instead of nirvana, the insecure status quo of today's mobile OSes, combined with (even more) absentee app store purveyors, turns side-loading into an alternative form of lock-in, with a kicker of added insecurity for users. With such a foundation, the tech-buying public could understand why a browser's superior sandboxing, web search's better discovery, and frictionless links are better than dodgy curation side-deals and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRegarding%20review%20processes,we%20can%20detect%3F%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D"><em>"beware of dog"</em> sign security.</a></p>
<p>The more that folks understand the stakes, the more likely tech will genuinely change for the better. And isn't that what public interest journalism is <em>for</em>?</p>

<li id="fn-recent-antitrust-news-1"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/antitrust">Antitrust is now a significant tech beat</a>, and recent events frequently include browser choice angles because regulators keep writing regulations that will enhance it. This beat is only getting more intense, giving the tech press ample column inches to explain the status quo more deeply and and educate around the most important issues.</p>
<p>In just the last two months:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Google lost to Epic in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23994174/epic-google-trial-jury-verdict-monopoly-google-play">jury trial that determined Google's Play Store is an illegal monopoly.</a></p>
</li>

And that's before we get to the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-denies-its-project-hug-bribed-20-developers-1851009202">light attempted bribery.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/googles-36-search-revenue-share-with-apple-is-3x-what-android-oems-get/">witness also blurted out a statistic that is both anodyne and damning: 36%.</a> That's what Google pays Apple in search rev-share for default search placement in Safari. Normally, this would be a detail of a boring business deal. In context, however, it highlights Apple's decade-long suppression of iOS browser competition â combined with <a href="https://wpt.fyi/results/?label=experimental&amp;label=master&amp;aligned">poverty-level funding of WebKit</a> â which has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/14/23960819/pichai-admits-google-pays-apple-a-36-percent-revenue-share-for-search-results">skimmed tens of billions in profit <em>per year</em> from the web</a> while starving browser development. This has deprived users, businesses, and web developers of safe (but critical) capabilities. It wasn't just Play that buggered the mobile web; Google was happy to outsource the dirty deed too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apple <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2023/1445">lost on an appeal</a> to keep the UK's Competition and Market Authority (CMA) <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/mobile-browsers-and-cloud-gaming">investigation into browsers and cloud gaming</a> on ice.<sup><a href="#fn-mir-icing-5" id="fnref-mir-icing-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In December, Apple <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/cma-reopens-investigation-into-apple/">declined to appeal to the UK's Supreme Court</a> for reasons that remain opaque.</p>
<p>Perhaps Apple didn't appeal because, in November, the UK unexpectedly brought forward the <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3453">Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill.</a> It looks set to become law early in the new year, standing up a regulator with real teeth who, one presumes, will not be predisposed to think well of Apple's delay of its predecessor's investigations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meanwhile, in the EU, Apple attempted to wriggle out of regulations that might bring about proper browser choice by <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/02/apple_safari_browser/">arguing that Safari is actually <em>three</em> under-performing browsers.</a> in <a href="https://brucelawson.co.uk/2023/apples-eu-legal-shenanigans/">a marketing trenchcoat</a><sup><a href="#fn-hair-splitting-6" id="fnref-hair-splitting-6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other side of the planet, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Japan-to-crack-down-on-Apple-and-Google-app-store-monopolies">news just broke that Japan will bring forward legislation</a> to target app store shenanigans. Given the JFTC's earlier findings about how interlocking layers of control have kept browsers from contesting app store prominence, we can expect some spicy legislative language around browsers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Australia has also <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/new-digital-competition-laws-for-australia/">just agreed (in principle) to do the same</a>, including language that acknowledges the role suppressing browser choice has had in preventing the web from competing with mobile native app ecosystems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All but one of the 19 links above are from just the last 60 days, a period which includes a holiday break in the US and Europe. With the EU's DMA coming into force in March and the CMA back on the job, browser antitrust enforcement is only accelerating. It sure would be great if reporters could occasionally connect these dots. <a href="#fnref-recent-antitrust-news-1">â©ï¸</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-convergent-agendas-2"><p>The stories of how Apple and Google have kept browsers from becoming real app stores differ greatly in their details, but the effects have been nearly identical: only their browsers could offer installation of web apps, and those browsers have done shockingly little to support web developers who want to depend on the browser as the platform.</p>
<p>The ways that Apple has undermined browser-based stores is relatively well known: no equivalent to PWA install or <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=255858">"Smart Banners" for the web</a>, no way for sites to <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=259490">suppress promotion of native apps</a>, no ability for competing browsers to trigger homescreen installation until just this year, etc. etc. The decade-long build of Apple's many and varied attacks on the web as a platform is a story that's both tired and under-told.</p>
<p>Google's malfeasance has gotten substantially less airtime, even among web developers â nevermind the tech press.</p>
<p>The story picks up in 2017, two years after the <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2015/03/chrome-42-beta-push-notifications_12.html">release of PWAs and Push Notifications in Chrome.</a> At the time, the PWA install flow was something of a poorly practised parlour trick: installation used an unreliable homescreen shortcut API that failed on many devices with OEM-customised launchers. The shortcut API also came laden with baggage that prevented effective uninstall and cross-device sync.</p>
<p>To improve this situation, <a href="https://web.dev/articles/webapks">"WebAPKs" were developed.</a> This new method of installation allows for deep integration with the OS, similar to the Application Identity Proxy feature that Windows lets browsers to provide for PWAs, with one notable exception: on Android, only Chrome gets to use the WebAPK system.</p>
<p>Without getting into the weeds, suffice to say many non-Chrome browsers requested access. Only Google could meaningfully provide this essential capability across the Android ecosystem. So important were WebAPKs that Samsung gave up begging and <a href="https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/new-year-new-samsung-internet-b74f282e4429">reverse engineered it for their browser</a> on Samsung devices. This only worked on Samsung phones where Suwon's engineers could count on device services and system keys not available elsewhere. That hasn't helped other browsers, and it certainly isn't an answer to an ecosystem-level challenge.</p>
<p>Without WebAPK API access, competing browsers can't innovate on PWA install UI and can't meaningfully offer PWA app stores. Instead, the ecosystem has been left to limp along at the excruciating pace of Chrome's PWA UI development.</p>
<p>Sure, Chrome's PWA support has been a damn sight better than Safari's, but that's just damning with faith praise. Both Apple and Google have done their part to quietly engineer a decade of unchallenged native app dominance. Neither can be trusted as exclusive stewards of web competitiveness. Breaking the lock on the doors holding back real PWA installation competition will be a litmus test for the effectiveness of regulation now in-flight. <a href="#fnref-convergent-agendas-2">â©ï¸</a> <a href="#fnref-convergent-agendas-2:1">â©ï¸</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-checkbox-compliance-3"><p>Push Notifications were, without exaggeration, the single most requested mobile Safari in the eight years between when Chromium browsers shipped them and when Apple finally capitulated.</p>
<p>It's unedifying to recount all of the ways Apple prevented competing iOS browsers from implementing Push, all while gaslighting developers who requested this business-critical feature over and over and over again. It's also unhelpful to fixate on the runarounds that Apple gave companies with enough clout to somehow find an Apple rep to harangue directly. So, let's call it water under the bridge. Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/sending_web_push_notifications_in_web_apps_and_browsers">shipped</a>, so we're good, right?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I regret to inform you, dear reader, that it not, in fact, "good".</p>
<p>Despite most of a decade to study up on the problem space, and nearly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Push_Notification_service">15 years of of experience</a> with Push, Apple's implementation is anything but complete.</p>
<p>The first few releases exposed APIs that hinted at important functionality, but were broken or missing. Features as core as closing notifications, or updating text when new data comes in. Think, showing the latest message in a chat, rather than leaving a stream of notifications in the tray for every message that has arrived since you last cleared the tray.</p>
<p>Important features didn't work. <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=258922">Some still don't.</a>. And the pathetic set of customisations provided for notification UI is a joke.</p>
<p>Web developers have once again been left to dig through the wreckage to understand just how badly Apple's <em>cough</em> "minimalist" <em>cough</em> implementation is compromised. And boy howdy, is it bad.</p>
<p>Apple's implementation might have <a href="https://wpt.fyi/results/notifications?label=experimental&amp;label=master&amp;aligned">passed surface-level tests</a> (gotta drive up that score!), but it's unusable for serious products. It's possible to draw many possible conclusions from this terrible showing, but even the relative charity of Hanlon's Razor is damning.</p>
<p>Nothing about this would be worse than any other under-funded, trailing-edge browser over the past three decades (which is to say, a bloody huge problem), except for Apple's well-funded, aggressive, belligerent ongoing protest to every regulatory attempt to allow true browser choice for iPhone owners.</p>
<p>In the year 2024, you can have any iOS browser you like. You can even set them as default. They <em>might</em> even have APIs that look like they'll solve important product needs, but as long as they're forced to rely on Apple's shit-show implementation, the web can't ever be a competitive platform.</p>
<p>When Apple gets to define the web's potential, the winner will always be native, and through it, Apple's bottom line. <a href="#fnref-checkbox-compliance-3">â©ï¸</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-self-censorship-4"><p>The muting effect of Apple's abuse of monopoly over wealthy users to kneecap the web's capabilities is aided by the self-censorship of web developers. The values of the web are a mirror world to native, where developers are feted for adopting bleeding-edge APIs. On the web, features aren't "available" until 90+% of all users have access to them. Because <a href="https://analytics.wikimedia.org/dashboards/browsers/#all-sites-by-os-and-browser">iOS is at least 20%</a> of <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/">the pie</a>), web developers don't go near features Apple fails to support. Which is a <em>lot</em>.</p>

    caniuse.com's <a href="https://caniuse.com/#:~:text=See%20full%20list-,Browser%20scores,-Current%20version">"Browser Score"</a> is one way to understand the scale of the gap in features that Apple has forced on all iOS browsers.

  </picture>
  <figcaption>
    The <a href="https://wpt.fyi/">Web Platform Tests dashboard</a> highlights 'Browser Specific Failures', which only measure failures <em>in tests for features the browser claims to support</em>. Not only are iOS browsers held back by Apple's shockingly poor feature support, but the features that _are_ available are broken so often that many businesses feel no option but to retreat to native APIs that Apple doesn't break on a whim, forcing the logic of the app store on them if they want to reach valuable users.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Apple's pocket veto over the web is no accident, and its abuse of that power is no bug.</p>
<p>Native app stores can only take an outsized cut if the web remains weak and developers stay dependent on proprietary APIs to access commodity capabilities. A prohibition on capable engines prevents feature parity, suppressing competition. A feature-poor, unreliable open web is essential to prevent the dam from breaking.</p>
<p>Why, then, have competing browser makers played along? Why aren't Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, and Opera on the ramparts, waving the flag of engine choice? Why do they silently lend their brands to Apple's campaign against the web? Why don't they rename their iOS browsers to "Chrome Lite" or "Firefox Lite" until genuine choice is possible? Why don't they ask users to write their representatives or sign petitions for effective browser choice? It's not like they shrink from it for <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/mozilla-joins-net-neutrality-blackout-for-break-the-internet-day/">other worthy causes.</a></p>
<p>I'm shocked by not surprised by the tardiness of browser bosses to seize the initiative. Instead of standing up to unfair terms, they've rolled over time and time again. It makes a perverse sort of sense.</p>
<p>More than 30 years have passed since we last saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix#:~:text=In%201983%2C%20the%20U.S.%20Department,System%20V%20into%20the%20market.">effective tech regulation.</a> The careers of those at the top have been forged under the unforgiving terms of late-stage, might-makes-right capitalism, rather than the logic of open markets and standards. Today's bosses didn't rise by sticking their necks above the parapets to argue virtue and principle. At best, they kept the open web dream alive by quietly nurturing the potential of open technology, hoping the situation would change.</p>
<p>Now it has, and yet they cower.</p>
<p>Organisations that value conflict aversion and <em>"the web's lane is desktop"</em> thinking get as much of it as they care to afford. <a href="#fnref-self-censorship-4">â©ï¸</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-mir-icing-5"><p>Recall that Apple <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-wins-appeal-against-uks-decision-investigate-its-mobile-browser-2023-03-31/">won an upset victory in March</a> after litigating the meaning of the word "may" and arguing that the CMA wasn't wrong to find after multiple years of investigations that Apple were (to paraphrase) inveterate shitheels, but rather that the CMA waited <em>too long</em> (six months) to bring an action which might have had teeth.</p>
<p>Yes, you're reading that right; Apple's <em>actual</em> argument to the Competition Appeal Tribunal amounted to a mashup of rugged, free-market fundamentalist <em>" but mah regulatory certainty!"</em>, performative fainting into strategically placed couches, and feigned ignorance about issues it knows it'll have to address in other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Court of Appeals was not to be taken for fools. Given the <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2023/1445#:~:text=In%20my%20judgement%2C%20the%20CAT%20lost%20sight%20of%20this%20consideration.%20There%20is%20no%20overarching%20principle%20that%20an%20undertaking%20is%20entitled%20to%20be%20investigated%20once%2C%20and%20once%20only.">harsh (in British) language</a> of the reversal, we can hope a chastened Competition Appeal Tribunal will roll over less readily in future. <a href="#fnref-mir-icing-5">â©ï¸</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-hair-splitting-6"><p>If you're getting the sense that legalistic hair-splitting is what Apple spends its <a href="https://venturebeat.com/mobile/apples-former-top-lawyer-1-billion-budget-enabled-high-risk-strategies/">billion-dollar-per-year legal budget</a> on because it has neither the facts nor real benefits to society on its side, <a href="http://www.fosspatents.com/2023/02/japans-competition-authority-jftc.html">wait 'till you hear about some of the stuff it filed with Japan's Fair Trade Commission!</a></p>
<p>A clear strategy is being deployed. Apple:</p>
<ul>
<li>First claims there's <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/meeting/house/110883/witnesses/HHRG-116-JU05-Wstate-CookT-20200729.pdf">no there there (pdf).</a> When that fails...</li>
<li>Claims competitors that it has expressly ham-strung are credible substitutes. When that fails...</li>
<li>Claims security would suffer if reasonable competition were allowed. Rending of garments is performed while prophets of doom recycle the script that the sky will fall if competing browsers are allowed (which would, in turn, expand the web's capabilities). Many treatments of this script fill the inboxes of regulators worldwide. When those bodies investigate, e.g. the history of iOS's forced-web-monoculture insecurity, and inevitably reject these farcical arguments, Apple...</li>
<li>Uses any and every procedural hurdle to prevent intervention in the market it has broken.</li>
</ul>
<p>The modern administrative state indulges firms with <em>"as much due process as money can buy"</em>, and Apple knows it, viciously contesting microscopic points. When bluster fails, <a href="https://infrequently.org/2022/02/minimum-standards/">huffingly implemented, legalistic, hair-splitting "fixes" are deployed</a> on the slowest possible time scale. This strategy buys years of delay, and it's everywhere: browser and mail app defaults, payment alternatives, engine choice, and right-to-repair. Even charging cable standardisation took years longer than it should have thanks to stall tactics. This maximalist, joined-up legal and lobbying strategy works to exhaust regulators and bamboozle legislators. Delay favours the monopolist.</p>
<p>A firm that can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17p3ThgMQYo">transform the economy of an entire nation</a> just by paying a bit of the tax it owes won't even notice a line item for lawyers to argue the most outlandish things at every opportunity. Apple (correctly) calculates that regulators are gun-shy about punishing them for delay tactics, so engagement with process is a is a win by default. Compelling $1600/hr white-shoe associates to make ludicrous, unsupportable claims is a <em>de facto</em> win when delay brings in billions. Regulators are too politically cowed and legally ham-strung to do more, and Apple plays process like a fiddle. <a href="#fnref-hair-splitting-6">â©ï¸</a></p>

            <link>https://lantern.dev/blog/hnsw-index-creation</link>
            <guid>38844945</guid>
            <pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2024 18:21:03 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lantern.dev/blog/hnsw-index-creation">https://lantern.dev/blog/hnsw-index-creation</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38844945">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://github.com/lanterndata/lantern">Lantern</a> is a Postgres extension to enable performant vector search using an index. Lantern is built using <a href="https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch/">Usearch</a>, an optimized C++ implementation of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320">HNSW algorithm</a>, the most performant algorithm for vector search.</p>
<p>In this post we discuss the significance of index creation times and how Lantern enables 90x faster index creation times than <a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector">pgvector</a>, another popular vector search Postgres extension, using external indexing. We also compare Lantern's performance against <a href="https://pinecone.io/">Pinecone</a>, a popular, closed-source hosted vector database.</p>
<h2 id="h2--316512533" level="2" siblingcount="51">Why fast index creation matters</h2>
<p>Index creation time affects how quickly a developer can add vector search to their data. On a single core, generating an index on 1 billion vectors could take days or even weeks.</p>
<p>It also affects how quickly a developer can experiment with different parameters to optimize their index. HNSW relies on two parameters for index construction:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>M</code> parameter controls the number of neighbors that each node in the graph will maintain. Higher values lead to longer construction times, longer query times, and higher memory usage, but result in a higher-quality index.</li>
<li>The <code>ef_construction</code> parameter determines how many nodes will be traversed during index construction. Higher values lead to longer construction times but result in a higher-quality index.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, there is a tradeoff between recall and latency. The ideal set of parameters requires experimentation to find. It depends on the application's recall / latency needs and the data itself (what recall is possible given the data distribution). This experimentation could become untenable with slow index creation times.</p>
<h2 id="h2-130942622" level="2" siblingcount="51">How external index creation enables parallelism</h2>
<p>With Postgres, HNSW index creation is single-threaded. This prevents the utilization of multiple cores to speed up index creation. In addition, the index creation process is resource-intensive, which can slow down other database operations. The latter would pose a problem even if HNSW index creation were multi-threaded.</p>
<p>Lantern allows developers to create an index externally, and then import the index as a file into their database. With external index creation, the core database remains unburdened during index creation, and the index can be created using multiple cores. This enables significant performance improvements.</p>
<p>Below we show the results of two sets of experiments with Lantern: one with index creation occurring inside Postgres, and one with index creation occurring externally. We compare Lantern's performance against pgvector and Pinecone.</p>
<h2 id="h2-11442535" level="2" siblingcount="51">Lantern's single-core index creation performance</h2>
<h3 id="h3--1383936870" level="3" index="12" siblingcount="51">Experiment Setup</h3>
<p>We use the following datasets</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/">sift</a> - 1 million vectors of 128 dimensions, downloadable <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/lanterndata/datasets/sift_base1m.csv">here</a></li>
<li><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/KShivendu/dbpedia-entities-openai-1M">wiki</a> - 1 million vectors of 1536 dimensions generated using the <code>text-embedding-ada-002</code> model</li>
</ul>
<p>The experiments were run on a Linode instance with 32 Cores and 64GB of RAM.</p>
<p>The SQL to create a table, copy the data, and create the index using Lantern follows</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>CREATE</span><span> TABLE</span><span> wiki1m</span><span> (id </span><span>SERIAL</span><span>, v </span><span>REAL</span><span>[]);</span></span>

<h3 id="h3-1281314467" level="3" index="25" siblingcount="51">Results Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>17x</strong> performance improvement compared to creating the index on a single thread.</li>
<li><strong>90x</strong> performance improvement compared to pgvector, and a <strong>6x</strong> improvement over Pinecone for sift dataset</li>
<li><strong>48x</strong> performance improvement over pgvector, as well as a <strong>3x</strong> improvement over Pinecone with 32 pods</li>
<li>Pinecone index on 32 p2 pods costs <strong>$3,889.44 / month</strong>. 32 CPU Linode costs <strong>$576 / month</strong>. Lantern is over <strong>6x cheaper and 6x faster!</strong></li>

<p>Fine-tuning the recall using parameters <code>m=16</code>, <code>ef_construction=128</code>, and <code>ef=128</code> for Lantern, we can achieve a 99% recall@5 for sift dataset, with the index creation taking only <strong>50 seconds</strong>.</p>
<p>Notice that a 2 Core Linode Server running Lantern outperforms Pineconeâs 32 pod cluster - this means that Lantern can be <strong>60x cheaper than Pinecone for the same performance.</strong></p>
<h2 id="h2--1139598294" level="2" siblingcount="51">External index creation with Lantern</h2>
<h3 id="h3--124802092" level="3" index="34" siblingcount="51">Implementation Details</h3>
<p>Here is a brief overview of how Lantern's external index creation works under the hood.</p>
<p>We use the row's <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-system-columns.html#DDL-SYSTEM-COLUMNS-CTID"><code>ctid</code></a> as a label for our nodes during index creation. Later, this label is used to retrieve the actual row from Postgres, as it represents the physical location of the row.</p>
<p>We use Postgres's <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/largeobjects.html">large object</a> functionality for data transfer. We use the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/lo-funcs.html"><code>lo_export</code></a> function to export the indexable data to the file system. After generating the index using <a href="https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch/">Usearch</a> on the file system, we then use the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/lo-funcs.html"><code>lo_import</code></a> function to transfer the index file to the database server.</p>
<h3 id="h3-1922878868" level="3" index="38" siblingcount="51">How to use external index creation</h3>
<ol>
<li>Install the <a href="https://github.com/lanterndata/lantern_extras/tree/main#lantern-index-builder">Lantern CLI</a></li>
<li>Create an index from a regular Postgres table via the <code>create-index</code> utility</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a walk through:</p>
<p>First, install the Lantern CLI:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>cargo</span><span> install</span><span> --git</span><span> https://github.com/lanterndata/lantern_extras</span><span> --bin</span><span> lantern-cli</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next, use the <code>create-index</code> utility to externally create and import our index to Postgres:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: If you encounter ONNXRuntime, issues, set up onnx runtime manually using <a href="https://github.com/lanterndata/lantern_extras?tab=readme-ov-file#building-from-source">these steps</a> and export the required env variables.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>lantern-cli</span><span> create-index</span><span> \</span></span>
<span><span>    --uri</span><span> postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432/testlive</span><span> \</span></span>
<span><span>    --table</span><span> sift</span><span> \</span></span>
<span><span>    --column</span><span> v</span><span> \</span></span>
<span><span>    -m</span><span> 8</span><span> \</span></span>
<span><span>    --efc</span><span> 128</span><span> \</span></span>
<span><span>    --ef</span><span> 64</span><span> \</span></span>
<span><span>    -d</span><span> 128</span><span> \</span></span>
<span><span>    --metric-kind</span><span> cos</span><span> \</span></span>
<span><span>    --out</span><span> index.usearch</span><span> \</span></span>
<span><span>    --import</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>--uri</code> parameter specifies the database connection URI, and the <code>--table</code> and <code>--column</code> parameters specify the table and column to index. The index parameters are <code>-m</code>, <code>--efc</code>, <code>--ef</code>, <code>-d</code> (dimension of column), and <code>--metric-kind</code> (<code>l2sq</code>, <code>cos</code>, or <code>hamming</code>). The <code>--out</code> parameter specifies the output file name. If <code>--import</code> is also specified, the externally created index will be automatically imported to Postgres after creation, and the temporary output file will be removed.</p>
<p>The table will be exclusively locked during the index creation process to avoid inconsistency. To reindex the data, use <code>select lantern_reindex_external_index('&lt;index_name&gt;')</code>; if you have <code>lantern_extras</code> extension installed in your database, or use the same CLI command as above and provide the <code>--index-name</code> argument. In the latter case, the existing index will be dropped and a new one will be created.</p>
<h2 id="h2-262204991" level="2" siblingcount="51">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post, we discussed the significance of index creation times, Lantern's external indexing process, and shared our benchmarking results against pgvector and Pinecone.</p>
<p>For a deeper dive into the code, you can check out our <a href="https://github.com/lanterndata/lantern">core repo</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/lanterndata/lantern_extras">Lantern Extras repo</a>. Our core repo enables vector search in Postgres, while Lantern Extras provides routines for external index generation and embedding management.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>a kind reader reached out about <a href="https://blog.greg.technology/2024/01/01/all-of-my-iphone-alarms.html">all of my iphone alarms</a> and asked how specifically did I run OCR on my mac. Iâm not one to gatekeep, so hereâs how you can get yourself a nice local ocr âserviceâ that works in the terminal/CLI/python and costs 0 dollars:</p>

<ul>
  <li>((by the way sharing Shortcuts <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/24/icloud-shortcut-sharing-broken/">is really weird</a> which is why Iâm having you do this all manuallyâ¦))</li>
  <li>(also, most of the stuff below only needs to be done once â after that, actually ocrâing is easy)</li>
  <li>open the <strong>Shortcuts</strong> app in your Applications folder</li>
  <li>click the â<strong>+</strong>â button to create a new shortcut</li>
  <li>in the right sidebar, search for â<strong>extract text</strong>â</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://blog.greg.technology/assets/how-to-ocr/step1.png"></p>

<ul>
  <li>you should see â<strong>Extract Text from Image</strong>â in the list of possible actions. <strong>drag it</strong> from the right sidebar into the main area on the left</li>
  <li>in the âExtract text from â¦â action thatâs now on the left, click on the pale â<strong>Image</strong>â blue-ish pill</li>
  <li>pick â<strong>Shortcut Input</strong>â</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://blog.greg.technology/assets/how-to-ocr/step2.png"></p>

<ul>
  <li>youâll see a big â<strong>Receive <em>Any</em> input from <em>Nowhere</em></strong>â action appear above the âExtract text from Shortcut Inputâ. itâs all good, leave it as is</li>
  <li>in the right sidebar, search for â<strong>copy</strong>â. you should see â<strong>Copy to Clipboard</strong>â. drag that action below the â<strong>Extract text from â¦</strong>â one
    <ul>
      <li>dragging the âCopy to â¦â action below the âExtract from â¦â is really annoyingly hard. just keep dragging it <em>really</em> below and it will work at some point</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>your final setup should look like this:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://blog.greg.technology/assets/how-to-ocr/step3.png"></p>

<ul>
  <li>in the last action, make sure that after â<strong>Copy</strong>â it does say â<strong>Text from Image</strong>â!</li>
  <li>youâre like almost done!!</li>
  <li>in the window title bar, type stuff to name the shortcut. because <a href="https://twitter.com/TheIdOfAlan/status/1458117496087748618">Iâm from a generation</a>, I recommend naming it âextract-textâ or âocr-textâ or something simple with no spaces and all lowercase. sorry. <strong>press enter</strong> after naming the shortcut otherwise it wonât remember the name (â¦??)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://blog.greg.technology/assets/how-to-ocr/step4.png"></p>

<ul>
  <li>ok you may be actually done here I think</li>
  <li>try out the shortcut in your terminal:</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code>shortcuts run ocr-text <span>-i</span> &lt;A PATH TO SOME IMAGE&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<ul>
  <li>then try <strong>command-V</strong> â do you see the resulting text? if yes, youâre good to go!!!</li>
  <li>from python, you can do the following:</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>subprocess</span>

<span>file_path</span> <span>=</span> <span>'... some file path ...'</span>
<span>ocr_out</span> <span>=</span> <span>subprocess</span><span>.</span><span>check_output</span><span>(</span>
    <span>f</span><span>'shortcuts run ocr-text -i "</span><span>{</span><span>file_path</span><span>}</span><span>"'</span><span>,</span> <span>shell</span><span>=</span><span>True</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>ocr_out</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<ul>
  <li>THATâS IT! x</li>
</ul>

<p>Large cloud providers <em>do</em> indeed go down and without carefully architecting your systems to handle the scenario of <em>when</em> they go down, not <em>if</em> they go down, you need to have automated <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-server-failover/">service failover</a> integrated into your system design process to ensure maximal uptime of your most critical applications. 2023 was a fun year for incidents, letâs have a look at just a few I cherry-picked below.</p>

<p>As Iâve invested more in standardizing hosting my applications on Kubernetes, I started to think about shifting my database into Kubernetes as well to centralize <em>how</em> I manage all my services in one place. While this topic doesnât come without heavy debate, I think weâve evolved to a point where supporting this hosting paradigm is pretty streamlined.</p>
<p>By the end of this article we will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup a highly-available and fault tolerant Postgres cluster from scratch</li>
<li>Host a UI to manage the clusters</li>
<li>Create a database and test disaster recovery by killing nodes</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If you see me issue the command <code>k</code>, itâs a custom alias mapped in my <code>~/.zshrc</code> that maps to <code>kubectl</code>. Iâll often just type <code>k</code> for brevity.</p>

<h2 id="zalando-postgres-operator">Zalando Postgres operator</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zalando/postgres-operator">Zalando</a> is a Postgres <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-operators-putting-operational-knowledge-into-software">operator</a> that facilitates the deployment of a highly available (HA) Postgres cluster. Zalando uses <a href="https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Patroni</a> under the hood, which is essentially a template for scaling HA Postgres clusters.</p>
<p>Key features of the Zalando Postgres Operator include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rolling updates on Postgres cluster changes, including quick minor version updates.</li>
<li>Live volume resize without pod restarts (for certain storage types like AWS EBS and PVC).</li>
<li>Database connection pooling with PGBouncer</li>
</ul>
<p>Letâs start by deploying the Zalando operator to our cluster followed by the Postgres cluster itself. We will be heavily referencing the <a href="https://postgres-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation</a> moving forward.</p>
<p>To keep things raw, we will use the manifests directly with <code>kubectl</code>.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><figcaption id="root-fig-1a8ghcbi"> PostgresOperatorDeploy.sh <!-- <span class="custom-figcaption__controls__lang">{lang}</span> -->  </figcaption> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="bash" data-theme=""><code data-line-numbers="" data-language="bash" data-theme="" data-line-numbers-max-digits="1"><span data-line=""><span># First, clone the repository and change to the directory</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>git</span><span> clone</span><span> https://github.com/zalando/postgres-operator.git</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>cd</span><span> postgres-operator</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span># apply the manifests in the following order</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>kubectl</span><span> create</span><span> -f</span><span> manifests/configmap.yaml</span><span>  # configuration</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>kubectl</span><span> create</span><span> -f</span><span> manifests/operator-service-account-rbac.yaml</span><span>  # identity and permissions</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>kubectl</span><span> create</span><span> -f</span><span> manifests/postgres-operator.yaml</span><span>  # deployment</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>kubectl</span><span> create</span><span> -f</span><span> manifests/api-service.yaml</span><span>  # operator API to be used by UI</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>I recommend reading each one of these manifests thoroughly to ensure compatibility with your cluster.</p>
<p>You can validate everything is running with <code>kubectl get pod -l name=postgres-operator</code>.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="bash" data-theme=""><code data-language="bash" data-theme=""><span data-line=""><span>NAME</span><span>                                READY</span><span>   STATUS</span><span>    RESTARTS</span><span>   AGE</span></span>

<h3 id="zalando-management-ui-optional">Zalando management UI (optional)</h3>
<p>Zalando provides a UI out of the box which is incredibly easy to deploy.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="bash" data-theme=""><code data-language="bash" data-theme=""><span data-line=""><span># using kubectl</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>kubectl</span><span> apply</span><span> -f</span><span> ui/manifests/</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span># or using Helmcharts</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span># helm install postgres-operator-ui ./charts/postgres-operator-ui</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>You can validate the deployment is running by grepping for the pods.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="bash" data-theme=""><code data-language="bash" data-theme=""><span data-line=""><span>â¯</span><span> kubectl</span><span> get</span><span> pods</span><span> |</span><span> grep</span><span> -i</span><span> postgres-operator-ui</span></span>

<p>Since I donât plan on exposing this, we can quickly crack it open with using <code>kubectl port-forward</code>.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="bash" data-theme=""><code data-language="bash" data-theme=""><span data-line=""><span>kubectl</span><span> port-forward</span><span> deploy/postgres-operator-ui</span><span> 9090</span><span>:8081</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>From here, we should be able to access the UI via <code>http://localhost:9090</code>.</p>

<p>Moving forward, I will <em>not</em> be using the UI, but itâs available if you prefer it.</p>
<h2 id="postgres-cluster-deployment">Postgres cluster deployment</h2>
<p>We will still be leveraging <a href="https://github.com/zalando/postgres-operator">Zalando</a> for deploying the Postgres cluster as well. You can view more options in the <a href="https://github.com/zalando/postgres-operator/blob/master/manifests/complete-postgres-manifest.yaml">complete manifest example YML</a>or the <a href="https://opensource.zalando.com/postgres-operator/docs/reference/cluster_manifest.html">parameter overview here</a>.</p>
<p>I have 3 nodes in my cluster and I want 2/3 to actually run the operator (node2 and node3). Before configuring the affinity to do this, we need to label our data plane nodes. The label here is arbitrary.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="bash" data-theme=""><code data-language="bash" data-theme=""><span data-line=""><span>kubectl</span><span> label</span><span> nodes</span><span> node2</span><span> pg-replication=</span><span>true</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>kubectl</span><span> label</span><span> nodes</span><span> node3</span><span> pg-replication=</span><span>true</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>In my case, Iâm just going to schedule on my <code>worker</code> nodes. using <code>node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=worker</code>.</p>
<p>Now we should be able to apply the <code>postgres</code> resource to our cluster.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There are a couple important things to point out that are subtle.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>numberOfInstances</code> total number of instances for a given cluster. The operator parameters&nbsp;<code>max_instances</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>min_instances</code>&nbsp;may also adjust this number. Required field.</li>
<li><code>enableMasterLoadBalancer</code> boolean flag to override the operator defaults (set by the&nbsp;<code>enable_master_load_balancer</code>&nbsp;parameter) to define whether to enable the load balancer pointing to the Postgres primary. Optional.</li>
<li><code>size</code> will be the amount allocated <em>for each</em> instance. In this case, we will allocate a total of 40Gi of storage.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case we have 2 running clusters that will sync with one another. The clusters will be running on 2 separate nodes due to the <code>nodeAffinity</code> selector.</p>

<li>Postgres operator for managing the cluster</li>
<li>Postgres operator UI</li>
<li>Cluster 0 running on node 2</li>
<li>Cluster 1 running on node 3</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="connecting-to-the-database">Connecting to the database</h2>
<p>Letâs connect to the DB. You can use whatever client you like, in my case Iâll use <code>PGAdmin</code>, but <code>psql</code> or something similar would suffice.</p>

<p>Typically you would have a load balancer IP that balances across your nodes running Postgres, but weâll validate with just a couple nodes independently and validate the data is replicated.</p>
<p>The <code>password</code> is auto generated and placed in a K8s secret. View it with:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="bash" data-theme=""><code data-language="bash" data-theme=""><span data-line=""><span># find the secret for the user you specified</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>k</span><span> get</span><span> secrets</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span># export the secret to stdout and base64 decode it so we can use within our DB client</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>kubectl</span><span> get</span><span> secret</span><span> schachte.pg-cluster.credentials.postgresql.acid.zalan.do</span><span> -o</span><span> jsonpath=</span><span>"{.data.password}"</span><span> |</span><span> base64</span><span> --decode</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Iâm going to create a <code>blog</code> database and add a <code>comments</code> table with dummy data as our starting point.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><figcaption id="root-fig-ecg11030"> dummyCommentsFixtures.sql <!-- <span class="custom-figcaption__controls__lang">{lang}</span> -->  </figcaption> <pre tabindex="0" data-language="sql" data-theme=""><code data-line-numbers="" data-language="sql" data-theme="" data-line-numbers-max-digits="2"><span data-line=""><span>CREATE</span><span> TABLE</span><span> comments</span><span> (</span></span>

<p>This will push 20 dummy records into the <code>comments</code> table.</p>
<h2 id="failover-test">Failover test</h2>
<p>We wonât deploy any crazy chaos testing automation, but we will simulate node failure to ensure failover is working without degradation. In my case, I have 2 nodes:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="bash" data-theme=""><code data-language="bash" data-theme=""><span data-line=""><span>â¯</span><span> k</span><span> describe</span><span> pod/pg-cluster-1</span><span> |</span><span> grep</span><span> -i</span><span> "Node:"</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>Node:</span><span>             node2/192.168.70.20</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>â¯</span><span> k</span><span> describe</span><span> pod/pg-cluster-0</span><span> |</span><span> grep</span><span> -i</span><span> "Node:"</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>Node:</span><span>             node3/192.168.70.30</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>If we delete <code>pg-cluster-1</code> using <code>k delete pod/pg-cluster-1</code>, we should still be able to read &amp; write to the DB. Once the node is deleted, it will be automatically scheduled to recreate itself based on the instance count specified in the Zalando deployment yaml.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>I wouldnât deploy this directly to production, but I think it gets a very good baseline setup. I would say next important steps would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>metrics with Prometheus</li>
<li>alerting via ntfy</li>
<li>better load balancing across nodes</li>
</ul> </div></div>]]></description>

            <pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2024 16:26:08 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2023-12-31-Canadian-payroll-dependency-chart.html">https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2023-12-31-Canadian-payroll-dependency-chart.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38843388">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>
The Canada Revenue Agency publishes, on a regular basis (they're now up to
the 119th edition), a document entitled
<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/payroll/t4127-payroll-deductions-formulas/t4127-jan/t4127-jan-payroll-deductions-formulas-computer-programs.html">"Payroll
Deductions Formulas"</a>.  This document contains all of the formulas needed
to calculate payroll deductions collected by the CRA: Canada Pension Plan,
Employment Insurance, and Income Tax.  As someone running a
<a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">small business in Canada</a> and not wanting
to use an external payroll provider, I implement these formulas myself in a
spreadsheet.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, like most aspects of the tax system, this steadily increases
in complexity, and this year with the Canada Pension Plan including not just
"base" premiums and "additional" premiums but also "second additional
premiums", I needed to rewrite my spreadsheet from scratch; and also very
unfortunately, the authors of the document have failed to grasp an essential
detail of software: You have to calculate values before you use them.  This
results in a document requiring constant jumping back and forth to find
where each value is calculated â before <i>or after</i> it is used.
</p><p>
To help myself keep everything straight, I decided to draw a dependency chart
using GraphViz.  There are 79 nodes in the graph, starting with values like
"Year's Annual Maximum Pensionable Earnings" ($73200 in the 2024 tax year),
and ending up with "Total payroll deductions".  Note that I did not write the
formulas onto the chart â I simply recorded which other values they
depend upon, so someone (aka myself) looking at the chart can figure out
what to calculate first without going around in circles.
</p><p>
Oh, and to keep things simple, I assumed I wasn't dealing with commissioned
employees, employees entering or exiting the Canada Pension Plan, or anyone
resident in Quebec, Nova Scotia, Yukon, or Ontario (each of which has their
own special tax complications).

Since our launch three years ago, we've demonstrated the viability of our model with a product protecting the shipping industry from changes in fuel price, and are now undergoing a large expansion into other sectors - particularly renewables and decarbonisation. Our new product for wind and solar farms protects them from falls in the price of electricity, and so makes investing in renewable power safer.</p><p>I have been Paratus's CTO / sole full-time developer at Paratus for three years (working with specialist contractors as required for UX, security etc), but we're looking to increase the team size to four to support substantially increased demand and expansion of the company. Our initial role will be to support the sales team by maintaining and enhancing our pricing model, with a natural pivot into expanding our books-and-records system as sales pick up. In the medium term, there's the prospect of interesting new development work as increased capacity allows us to automate new parts of the business flow.</p><p>Senior Developer - Â£100k+ (negotiable depending on experience/fit etc)</p><p>The key thing we're looking for from our second developer hire is that they should be able to stand in for me in a pinch. Specifically:</p><p>â¢ You should be comfortable and familiar with the core of our tech stack (Java / Spring / PostgreSQL / AWS).</p><p>â¢ You should need be able to get up to speed quickly on an unfamiliar project and, after a short period of orientation, be able to self-teach / find your way around on your own.</p><p>â¢ A key requirement is that you should be able to cover for me if I become sick or unavailable - you should quickly reach the point where you can reliably carry out urgent development work unsupported.</p><p>â¢ A mathematical background would be a plus - our pricing model is somewhat technical and one of the key things we need to support.</p><p>â¢ As the team grows, you should be able to skill up quickly enough to be able to support and mentor less experienced developers who still need some help finding their way around.</p><p>â¢ Being able to assist with interview and recruitment processes would also be a plus.</p><p>Developer - Â£60k-85k</p><p>â¢ You should have experience writing software as part of a team, using Git or other version control.</p><p>â¢ You should know how to write automated tests and understand why they are important.</p><p>â¢ You don't need to have the depth of experience necessary to become fully autonomous on day one, but once you understand a task and the area of the codebase you're changing, you should be capable of working reliably and independently.</p><p>Please email a CV / cover letter to careers@paratusltd.com to apply.

I've been working in IT security consulting for about two years since graduating with a masters in Computer Science specialized in IT-Security.

Boring, standardized and automated is the way any system should be run.</p><p>I run my own hypervisor at home for fun and spent many years developing Open Source Minecraft Plugins and writing my own Minecraft client from scratch.

From improving legacy infra and processes in an established telco company to scaling a fast-moving startup from 200K to 2M users.

I consider myself introverted but apparently my communication skills are above average for Software Engineers. I also pride myself on my humility and modesty.</p><p>I'd love to explore other technical positions in the games industry short of joining a AAA studio because (a) I don't want to crunch and (b) my skill set does not lay that way; other tech-creative industries would also appeal to me!

Hey there. I hope you're having a great start to the new year.<p>My name is Koray. Iâve been programming since I was ten years old, starting with computer magazines. It quickly turned into my career, and I've had the opportunity to work in various companies since I was 16.</p><p>Eight years ago, at the age of 23, I started my first company. Since then, I've been involved in different roles, primarily focusing on technical product leadership and cross-platform application development. Some of the products I have built and helped build have been embraced by millions of users, received awards, and consistently maintained high rankings on app stores.</p><p>Recently, my latest pursuit came to an end due to funding constraints. Now, I'm excited to explore new opportunities where I can wear different hats. I'm open to any industry and I'm technology-agnostic.</p><p>I love learning new things and have a wide range of interests, including 3D printing, IoT, and home automation. On a fun note, I also collect vinyls, synthesisers and groove boxes.</p><p>You can find additional information on my website and CV. If there is a match, let's chat!

So basically I have my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and started out as an energy engineer but pivoted to software development. I got my masters in computer science and I am now working as a contractor for a Big 3 Automotive company in their embedded software group. It's fun, but I am looking at other options since they're making us come back into the office this year. I would be open to working in an office, but it has to be the right location.<p>I would love a role where I can learn more, diversify my skills, and have some cool stories to tell.

Hi! My name's Nathan Douglas, and I'm a squishy generalist; I prefer SRE/platform engineering/DevOps-as-a-role but I've been fighting with computers for about 30 years now and I've done a little of everything. I tend to be the guy who debugs the Hard Problems, because I'm tenacious and a bit obsessive. I love DevOps-as-a-methodology because I love studying processes, creating value stream maps, identifying, planning, and implementing improvements, etc. But I also love the role because when something happens on a running server, I'm fairly good at staying calm, figuring out what's causing the problem, and fixing it.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Hi, my name is Eli. I've worked for years as a fully remote Python programmer for a very large financial institution in their cybersecurity department. I'm ready for something new.<p>I took some time off starting at the end of August to evaluate my options. I was going to go back to grad school to study AI, but I've realized that many of the foremost AI researchers right now are in the industry, not necessarily at Stanford or CMU. I am interested in working with these people to help propel the field of AI forward, in whichever way I can contribute. My educational background is in Math and Biology.

This tends to lead to elegant solutions with fewer edge cases and exceptions, and hold up better when having to adapt to previously unknown needs.

I've done some security work in the Linux Kernel (containerization primitives), in systemd as well as some work on Secure Boot.<p>Notably I've implemented auto-enrollment of secure boot keys in systemd. See (<a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/20255">https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/20255</a> &amp; <a href="https://lpc.events/event/16/contributions/1259/" rel="nofollow">https://lpc.events/event/16/contributions/1259/</a>).</p><p>Lately, I've been very interested in MicroVMs and minimizing the Linux Kernel attack surface.</p><p>Message me if any of that sounds interesting!

Each step in that process sheds more light on what is possible, what the requirements and scopes of the projects actually are, and what changes and alterations to the design should be made. In my experience following an iterative, agile approach where product owners are kept in-the-loop throughout the entire dev cycle results is vastly better products.</p><p>I'm very good at getting up to speed with new technologies and requirements and thrive solving difficult or nebulous problems. My development background has required me to pick up a broad range of skills and to tackle a broad range of problems from security design to debugging and patching 3rd-party libraries. It's my policy to try and leave teams, products, and codebases in a better position and in a better condition than I found them.</p><p>I am currently interested in both consulting and contracting roles. My dev process when contracting is very similar to how I approach consulting tasks; I believe there's a huge value add in making sure that development processes are tightly integrated into the planning and design of features, products, and architecture. If you have an interesting problem to solve, I'd love to get in touch :)

A little about myself: My CV is not up to date, I have been working as non-founding CTO for a smaller games company for the last 18 months. During this time I have been responsible for 12 direct reports and 25-ish indirect reports. I've revamped and refined the technology direction (going from an outsourced tech prototype to a beta-released quality product), grown the team (and culture) from 4 persons to a 50 person startup, including managing software licensing and budgeting, I have lead direction on the behaviour of online systems, conformance testing for non-PC platforms.<p>I also acted as legal guarantor, streamlined developer productivity with better (and easier to collaborate) tools including a migration from Office365 to Google Workspace, Bitbucket-&gt;Gitlab, SVN-&gt;Perforce Helix (game studio, of course) and standardised on an IDE platform that supports remote and live collaborative development, I have acted as mentor to over 4 people in very disparate areas of the tech organisation (Build Engineering, Gameplay programming, tools programming and online backend team). I have also been the person primarily responsible for creating realistic milestones while taking into consideration our limited capacity and externally communicated ambitious deadlines -- without the expertise of a project manager or producer. -- all of this in a fully remote environment.</p><p>I seem to be received well as a senior manager, based on what my reports say to the head of operations at least, but I prefer going technically deep on topics and not spending all my time in more high level areas (and meetings). In my professional life I have had success as an SRE-type person but would prefer perhaps to work in developer experience or backend programming roles.</p><p>I have previously released games as part of a very small  Live Operations team such as: "Tom Clancy's The Division" and it's sequel "The Division 2"; as part of Ubisoft/Massive and I released "Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodhunt" as part of Tencent/Sharkmob. Before this I worked in eCommerce. In all positions I was SRE. Ask me about the depth of my automation if you want war stories. :)</p><p>I have gone extremely deep into linux system internals, databases and networking. My knowledge of Rust and Python is strong but my Go is a little lackluster unfortunately as on a personal level I dislike its slice mutability semantics and propensity for data races (which do not exist in Rust and is something that the GIL outright kills in Python)</p><p>I'm open to relocation, and even taking a pretty drastic pay cut as I'm currently paid as a CTO.. What I really need is a culture of trust and autonomy, as I have strong intrinsic motivation and a decent amount of skill but unfortunately I dislike politics and bureaucracy.

The policy allows AI to use any data <a href="https://www.biia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Keiko_Nagaoka_20151102_cropped-600x800-1-e1687193572247.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.biia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Keiko_Nagaoka_20151102_cropped-600x800-1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="165" height="220" data-src="https://www.biia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Keiko_Nagaoka_20151102_cropped-600x800-1-225x300.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></a>âregardless of whether it is for non-profit or commercial purposes, whether it is an act other than reproduction, or whether it is content obtained from illegal sites or otherwise.â <strong>Keiko Nagaoka, Japanese Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</strong>,&nbsp;<a href="https://go2senkyo.com/seijika/122181/posts/685617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a>&nbsp;the bold stance to local meeting, saying that Japanâs laws wonât protect copyrighted materials used in AI datasets.</span></p>

<p><span>English language coverage of the situation is sparse. It seems the Japanese government believes copyright worries, particularly those linked to anime and other visual media, have held back the nationâs progress in AI technology. In response, Japan is going all-in, opting for a no-copyright approach to remain competitive.</span></p>
<p><span>This news is part of Japanâs ambitious plan to become a leader in AI technology. Rapidus, a local tech firm known for its advanced 2nm chip technology, is stepping into the spotlight as a serious contender in the world of AI chips. With Taiwanâs political situation looking unstable, Japanese chip manufacturing could be a safer bet. Japan is also stepping up to help shape the global rules for AI systems within the G-7.</span></p>
<h2><span>Artists vs. Business (Artists Lost)</span></h2>
<p><span>Not everyone in Japan is on board with this decision. Many anime and graphic art creators are concerned that AI could lower the value of their work. But in contrast, the academic and business sectors are pressing the government to use the nationâs relaxed data laws to propel Japan to global AI dominance.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite having the worldâs third-largest economy, Japanâs economic growth has been sluggish since the 1990s. Japan has the lowest per-capita income in the G-7. With the effective implementation of AI, it could potentially boost the nationâs GDP by 50% or more in a short time. For Japan, which has been experiencing years of low growth, this is an exciting prospect.</span></p>
<h2><span>Itâs All About The Data</span></h2>
<p><span>Western data access is also key to Japanâs AI ambitions. The more high-quality training data available, the better the AI model. While Japan boasts a long-standing literary tradition, the amount of Japanese language training data is significantly less than the English language resources available in the West. However, Japan is home to a wealth of anime content, which is popular globally. It seems Japanâs stance is clear â if the West uses Japanese culture for AI training, Western literary resources should also be available for Japanese AI.</span></p>
<h2><span>What This Means For The World</span></h2>
<p><span><strong>On a global scale, Japanâs move adds a twist to the regulation debate</strong>. Current discussions have focused on a ârogue nationâ scenario where a less developed country might disregard a global framework to gain an advantage. But with Japan, we see a different dynamic. <strong>The worldâs third-largest economy is saying it wonât hinder AI research and development. Plus, itâs prepared to leverage this new technology to compete directly with the West</strong>.</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://chrisnicholas.dev/blog/a-new-blog-for-2024">https://chrisnicholas.dev/blog/a-new-blog-for-2024</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38842116">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Itâs been a <em>long time</em> since Iâve published a blog post, two whole years. Part of the reason is that it took too much effort to create posts for my previous blog. I needed better DX. A few nights ago, feeling inspired after reading articles by <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" href="https://ped.ro/writing/website-refresh-2023" data-headlessui-state="">Pedro Duarte</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" href="https://rauno.me/craft/vercel" data-headlessui-state="">Rauno Freiberg</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" href="https://leerob.io/blog/2023" data-headlessui-state="">Lee Robinson</a>, I decided it was time to start over.</p>

<p>So hereâs the scoreâI want a blog with great DX that makes it as easy as possible to create posts. I also want to go <em>minimal</em>, so I can get away with a single design on mobile and desktop. No faffing around; I want this blog built and published in 5 days! And lastly, Iâm looking to try some new libraries and technologies. Right, letâs dive in.</p>

<p>At work I spend most of my time <a data-headlessui-state="" href="https://chrisnicholas.dev/work">writing and programming</a>, so dipping my toes into design was a nice change. Hereâs a couple of details.</p>

<p>For the header, I was aiming for an animated background that combined an <em>aurora</em>, <em>light beams</em>, and a <em>rainbow</em>. Iâm quite pleased with the result, and it's actually pure CSSâtry changing <code><span><span>hue</span><span>-</span><span>rotate</span></span></code> below to emulate the animation.</p>
<figure><figcaption>An interactive demo showing the header background</figcaption><pre><code>.aurora <!-- -->{<br>  <!-- -->filter:<!-- --> <span>hue-rotate(<!-- -->0<!-- -->deg)</span> <span>saturate(<!-- -->7.0<!-- -->)</span> <span>blur(<!-- -->30<!-- -->px)</span>;<br>}</code></pre><div><p><label for="change-aurora-hue"><code>hue-rotate</code></label><label for="change-aurora-saturate"><code>saturate</code></label><label for="change-aurora-blur"><code>blur</code></label></p></div></figure>
<h3 id="saturated-text"><a href="#saturated-text">Saturated text</a></h3>
<p>All text that overlays the aurora is saturated with its underlying coloursâa tiny touch that really unifies the design. You can do this by simply applying a <code><span><span>luminosity</span></span></code> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" href="https://www.ctnicholas.dev/articles/which-blend-mode" data-headlessui-state="">blend mode</a> to the text.</p>
<figure><div><p>My nameâs Chris Nicholas</p></div><div data-slot="field" data-headlessui-state=""><p><span data-slot="control" id="headlessui-control-:R8lmuuuela:" role="checkbox" aria-checked="true" tabindex="0" data-headlessui-state="checked" data-checked=""><span><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" fill="none"><path d="M3 8L6 11L11 3.5" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path><path d="M3 7H11" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg></span></span><label data-slot="label" id="headlessui-label-:R9olmuuuela:" for="headlessui-control-:R8lmuuuela:" data-headlessui-state=""><code>mix-blend-mode: luminosity;</code></label></p></div></figure>
<h3 id="noise"><a href="#noise">Noise</a></h3>
<p>Iâm applying a tiny amount of film grain to the <code><span><span>body</span></span></code>. To me, this makes the page feel like one consistent piece; as you scroll down, the noise sticks to the content, somewhat similar to seeing texture on paper.</p>
<figure><figcaption>An interactive demo allowing you to change the noise level on the page</figcaption><pre><code>.noise <!-- -->{<br>  <!-- -->opacity:<!-- --> <span>0.018</span>;<br>}</code></pre><p><label for="change-noise-opacity"><code>opacity</code></label></p></figure>
<p>I wouldnât recommend noise for most websites, and itâs very easy to overdo it, but I enjoy the subtle filmic effect on my blog.</p>
<h3 id="catalyst"><a href="#catalyst">Catalyst</a></h3>
<p>Iâm using <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" href="https://tailwindcss.com/blog/introducing-catalyst" data-headlessui-state="">Catalyst</a>, a new UI kit by the Tailwind team. Itâs clear that a tonne of thought has gone into making these components accessible, and pixel perfect, on both light and dark modes.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Tailwind UI Catalyst demo</figcaption><div><p><span>badge</span><span data-slot="control" aria-label="Example checkbox" id="headlessui-checkbox-:R2p3muuuela:" role="checkbox" aria-checked="true" tabindex="0" data-headlessui-state="checked" data-checked=""><span><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" fill="none"><path d="M3 8L6 11L11 3.5" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path><path d="M3 7H11" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg></span></span></p></div></figure>
<p>Catalyst provides you with a set of files to download into your project, and you can export your components from these. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" href="https://heroicons.com/" data-headlessui-state="">Heroicons</a> has also been updated with new icons that fit neatly into Catalyst.</p>

<pre><code><span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>Button</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>../components/Button</span><span>"</span><span>;</span><span></span></span>

<span><span>	</span><span></span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>Component</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></span>

<span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>If youâd like to customise your components further, you can edit the downloaded files directly. Each file contains <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" href="https://headlessui.com/" data-headlessui-state="">Headless UI</a> components with lists of carefully annotated classes dispersed throughout.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>HeadlessListBoxButton</span><span></span></span>

<span><span>  </span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span></span></span>
<span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Catalyst is still in alpha, so be warned, breaking changes will most likely be ahead!</p>
<h3 id="twc"><a href="#twc">TWC</a></h3>
<p>While weâre talking about Tailwind, Iâve used a new library called <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" href="https://react-twc.vercel.app/" data-headlessui-state="">TWC</a> to save time building reusable components. It takes boilerplate code you've written countless times (forwarding refs, adding <code><span><span>clsx</span></span></code>, etc.), and makes it a one-liner.</p>

<p>Iâve used <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" href="https://nextjs.org/" data-headlessui-state="">Next.js</a> to build my new blog, and virtually every component is a server component. It feels pretty snappy, I like it.</p>
<h4>Layout files</h4>
<p>Did you notice that the header animation continues running when you change pages?

Initially, the images that flashed before her eyes were beautiful: fountains of colors, fields of tulips, peacock feathers. Then they turned dark: monsters, claws, demonic eyes, vampires. She saw kings and beggars dead, buried, eaten by worms, providing food for animals and eventually for other people. âImagine the countless atoms of our ancestors in this perpetual motion!â she cried aloud, describing everything she saw to another patient, sitting beside her bed.</p><p>Hana had a troubled life. Born in 1949, she grew up in a town south of Prague, in a family crushed by poverty. When Hana was a child, her father drank and her spiteful mother often hit her for wetting the bed. At school, classmates teased her for wearing secondhand clothes, which were often damp because she was too shy to ask permission to go to the bathroom. In her teens, she was lonely and angry, so tormented by vivid dreams of murdering her enemies that she asked to be hospitalized. At 18, she married a boy she barely knew, separated from him after four months, and then tried to kill herself by swallowing 30 sleeping pills.</p><div><figure><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Karel_%C5%A0ebek_in_Lochovice" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="563" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Hana-K.jpg" alt=""></a><figcaption>Hana K.

Although intelligent, she was also considered hopelessly psychotic. But in 1969, when she faced another return to DobÅany, Hana told her family doctor she would rather kill herself â and this time the doctor referred her to the 112-bed clinic at SadskÃ¡, a facility east of Prague specializing in repeated sessions of LSD psychotherapy, directed by the psychiatrist Milan Hausner (1929â2000).</p><p>Hausner originally doubted that she could be helped. But as he listened to a recording of Hanaâs third LSD session, he saw some hope. âThe most pronounced aspect of this session is her archetypal regression into the realm of antiquity and to the very beginnings of humanity,â Hausner later wrote. âHana is beginning to formulate a new attitude toward death and eternity.â</p><p>Over the next six months, Hana had 20 more sessions of LSD. Hausner told her that she might need 60 to be cured.</p><hr><p>As Sarah Marks and others have <a href="https://journals.openedition.org/monderusse/8165" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">detailed</a>, psychiatry in communist Europe was not merely an obedient lapdog to the Pavlovian conditioning promoted by the Soviet Union. It was far more varied and complex â and certainly one of its most unusual chapters concerns the use of LSD psychotherapy in 1960s Czechoslovakia, when that countryâs progression to a more humane government, its increasing openness to Western Europe, and its developments in psychiatry and pharmacology all coincided with a worldwide curiosity about psychedelic drugs.</p><figure><blockquote><p>The drug was a âprobe into the subconscious,â Hausner wrote â and âthe probe goes very deep, often into the first days of life, if not further.â</p></blockquote></figure><p>Until recently, LSD therapy in Czechoslovakia was known mainly through the work of Stanislav Grof (1931â), who practiced at Pragueâs Psychiatric Research Institute, moved to the U.S. in 1967, and is today celebrated as one of the founders of transpersonal psychology. But dozens of other Czech and Slovak psychiatrists also used LSD in psychotherapy, and the most dedicated and outspoken of them was Hausner, who supervised more than 3,000 LSD sessions, published research in more than 100 articles and books, and yet remains largely unknown, even in his homeland.</p><p>Hausner grew up in Prague, the only child of an insurance clerk and a pharmacist. He was drawn to the healing arts early: In May 1945, during the uprising against Nazi Germanyâs occupation of Czechoslovakia, he cared for fighters at Pragueâs barricades. Germany had closed Czech universities during the six-year occupation, so after the war, the need for young doctors was acute, and in 1948 â the same year the communists seized control of Czechoslovakiaâs government â Hausner enrolled in medicine at Pragueâs Charles University. After graduating in 1953, he practiced psychiatry in various places around the country, including a childrenâs hospital. He married Zdena ProchÃ¡zkovÃ¡, a medical statistician, completed his compulsory military service, and by 1958 was back in Prague, busily working on several psychiatric wards, often traveling from one hospital to another on the same day.</p><div><figure><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262546935/expanding-mindscapes/" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" width="320" height="480" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/expanding-mindscapes.jpg" alt=""></a><figcaption>This story is excerpted from the volume â<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262546935/expanding-mindscapes/" target="_blank">Expanding Mindscapes</a>.â An open access edition of the book is freely available to download <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/5697/Expanding-MindscapesA-Global-History-of" target="_blank">here</a>.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Hausner first experienced LSD in experiments conducted by JiÅÃ­ RoubÃ­Äek, likely in 1954. RoubÃ­Äek, a neurologist, was interested in comparing the brain-wave patterns of schizophrenic patients with those of healthy subjects undergoing a âmodel psychosisâ induced by LSD, which he obtained from Sandoz and started experimenting with in 1952. Since LSD produces mind-altering effects in tiny amounts without inflicting physical harm, RoubÃ­Äekâs superiors considered it safe, and many young psychiatrists became his test subjects. (Czech doctors have a tradition of self-experimentation: The Czech medical society is named after Jan Evangelista PurkynÄ, a 19th-century physiologist who asserted that one learns best from direct experience and studied the effects that he underwent after ingesting such substances as digitalis and belladonna.) Unfortunately, itâs not known what Hausner thought of his own LSD experiences, as he did not describe them in his writings.</p><p>In the late 1950s, Hausner started conducting his own medical research, publishing a study of his application of the new antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine combined with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Increasingly, however, he was interested less in biological psychiatry and more in psychotherapy â a controversial discipline, as it was often associated with Freudian psychoanalysis, which communists considered unscientific, individualistic, and likely to bankrupt national health insurance programs. In 1959, Czech ideologues denounced Ferdinand Knobloch (1916â2018), the head of psychiatry at Charles Universityâs medical-faculty polyclinic, for advocating the use of psychotherapy to treat neuroses, and Hausner came to his defense. In the journal <em>Czechoslovak psychiatry</em>, Knobloch assured his readers that he was developing a âmaterialisticâ psychotherapy, with measurable results, and Hausner provided a survey of recent Soviet medical literature showing that Russian doctors already were practicing psychotherapy in various forms, using suggestion (often with hypnosis) and persuasion, in an effort to fully understand âthe personality of socialist man in unity with the socialist environment.â (Hausner read and spoke Russian, along with English and German.) Czechoslovakia held an international congress on treating neuroses later that year, so a wider acceptance of psychotherapy was already underway. But Knobloch likely appreciated Hausnerâs support, because he soon hired Hausner to work at the university polyclinic.</p><p>Between seeing patients, Hausner wrote his first book, âThe Mentally Ill Among Usâ (1961), a guide to the mental-health system for patients and their families that told the story of a young manâs psychotic break, his treatment through medication and psychotherapy, and his return to work. In the preface, Hausner noted that Czechoslovakiaâs third Five-Year Plan (1961â1965) called for wider treatment of ânervous diseases,â and he hoped that his readers would learn that âmental illness does not equal disgrace, but can be successfully treated like any other physical illness.â (Hausnerâs compassionate book was so popular that it was republished in 1969, 1978, and 1981.) During this time, he also began paying privately to undergo psychoanalysis, perhaps with Knobloch, as part of his training to become a psychoanalyst himself. Most fatefully, though, he became interested in treating patients with LSD, newly available from Czechoslovakiaâs government laboratories.</p><p>In 1956, chemists at the Research Institute for Pharmacy and Biochemistry in Prague filed a patent for a new process for making LSD, and in 1959, the ministry of health gave the institute permission to begin producing the drug, trademarked Lysergamid, âprimarily for experimental purposes.â So Hausner devised an experiment. In 1954, R. A. Sandison and other British doctors had <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1955-02868-001" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reported benefits</a> in neurotic patients who received small-to-substantial doses of LSD (25 to 400 <em>Âµ</em>g, or micrograms) in conjunction with individual psychotherapy, applied repeatedly over several months<sup> </sup>â a method that Sandison later called âpsycholyticâ therapy. Hausner wondered if this would work in groups. Through the university, he knew VladimÃ­r DoleÅ¾al, a medical doctor and chemist specializing in toxicology, and they proposed using LSD in a therapeutic community established by Hausnerâs boss.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Even under communism, Czechs with âbad nervesâ were typically treated with baths at the countryâs opulent 19th-century spa resorts.</p></blockquote></figure><p>At the polyclinic, Knobloch had become intrigued by the self-defeating behavior of his neurotic patients, so heâd developed a retreat for them on a state farm in LobeÄ (35 miles north of Prague), modeled on the therapeutic community for traumatized soldiers that Maxwell Jones <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0957154X221140734" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">had established</a> near London in 1947. Even under communism, Czechs with âbad nervesâ were typically treated with baths at the countryâs opulent 19th-century spa resorts, and Knobloch wanted to prove that he could help more people at less cost. At LobeÄ, 15 men and 15 women spent several hours every day working on the farm, and several additional hours with a rehabilitation aide engaged in group discussions or various types of therapy, producing art or music or acting out events from their lives via psychodrama or âpsychogymnastics,â a nonverbal exercise incorporating movement and mime. A psychiatrist from Prague visited to direct individual and group psychotherapy only once or twice a week, so the patients effectively became cotherapists, a design that Hausner tried to duplicate at SadskÃ¡.</p><p>In their experiment, Hausner and DoleÅ¾al gave 11 neurotic patients 100 <em>Âµ</em>g of LSD in conjunction with six hours of individual psychotherapy; seven got 50 <em>Âµ</em>g and group therapy, and seven got saline as a control. After several weeks, the patients whoâd received LSD and individual therapy showed the most improvement, displaying new insights and changed attitudes in their relationships with staff and other patients. Those who received LSD in the group had the worst results: âPatients were more concerned about their unusual experiences than to expose them to the therapeutic effect of the collective.â It was a modest study, but the first on LSD psychotherapy to appear in the Czech medical literature.</p><p>Other Czech doctors were starting to use the drug. Stanislav Grof began psycholytic therapy with neurotic patients at the Psychiatric Research Institute in 1961, and that year the authorities approved Lysergamid for outpatient psychiatry, encouraging other doctors around Czechoslovakia to test it in their own practices. Individual psychotherapy expanded, and soon it was possible to discuss concepts that were essentially Freudian: In 1963, Hausner and DoleÅ¾al published a remarkable how-to guide for hallucinogens in the journal <em>Czechoslovak psychiatry</em>, citing the West German psychiatrist Hanscarl Leunerâs contention that such drugs âreawakened psychic dynamicsâ by evoking âage regression going to the first years of life,â âre-living of forgotten traumatic events,â and providing âabreactive emotional release with subsequent insight.â They outlined radical techniques, some borrowed from Leuner and other Western LSD doctors, that they used at LobeÄ: getting patients to write out their autobiographies, using family photos to encourage associations, having the doctor play characters perceived in patientsâ hallucinations, and even recruiting other patients to assist with the sessions. Hausner and DoleÅ¾al quoted their patients endorsing LSD therapy, included samples of patientsâ artwork, and claimed that after a year, 75 percent of their patients receiving LSD and individual therapy had improved, although the best results were in those whoâd combined such therapy with a stay at LobeÄ, where they could practice insights acquired from their LSD experience.</p><p>Through such research, Hausner established contact with Leuner, who became the principal advocate for psycholytic therapy after Sandison moved on from LSD in 1964. Hausner started getting published in international journals, Czechoslovakia began permitting academics to travel to capitalist countries, and in August 1964, Hausner summarized his LobeÄ work at the Sixth International Congress of Psychotherapy in London. By 1965, Czechoslovakiaâs authorities had approved commercial production of its LSD, and Hausner wrote a paper â published in English â for the state pharmaceutical export firm, noting that Lysergamid was indistinguishable from Sandozâs product and describing its effectiveness in outpatient psychiatry. He would run 104 sessions with 65 patients, using doses of 50 to 300 <em>Âµ</em>g, and found LSD was âa valuable means for deepening and accelerating the psychotherapy.â (Perhaps reluctant to limit foreign interest in Lysergamid to therapeutic communities, Hausner downplayed his LobeÄ research, writing that heâd seen âno impressive differencesâ in results with outpatients.)</p><p>Hausner had credentials, contacts, and a steady supply of LSD. He was ready to apply everything that heâd learned at a clinic of his own.</p><hr><p>The psychiatric clinic at SadskÃ¡, a town of 3,000 residents 40 miles east of Prague, consisted of a pair of two-floor pavilions originally constructed in the 1920s as a retreat for postal employees to enjoy a nearby lake and mineral spa, or walk along the Elbe River and through the Kersko forests. To meet the growing demand for psychiatric care, the ministry of health acquired the facility and began admitting patients in 1962. But by the autumn of 1965, SadskÃ¡âs chief physician was losing his eyesight. The clinic was affiliated with Charles Universityâs faculty of medicine, so Hausner, then 36, got the job, and he quickly made changes.</p><p>Pavilion A remained devoted to standard psychiatry for inpatients suffering issues from hysteria to psychosis. But Hausner had Pavilion B remodeled as an open ward to suit a therapeutic community. He selected some 50 inpatients for it, to stay six to eight weeks, and from them, he chose one or two groups of 12 to 14 patients who he thought were most likely to benefit from LSD, to stay six months. As at LobeÄ, the patients spent mornings laboring in the forest or in the clinicâs garden and workshop, afternoons in group discussions, and evenings hearing lectures, creating dances or plays, or watching films. But with his own facility, Hausner could fully implement psycholytic therapy, and every day several patients underwent LSD.</p><p>The drug was usually delivered by injection to control the dosage, and before breakfast so the patients wouldnât be hungry in the middle of their trip. Sessions were conducted in the patientsâ rooms â LSD groups were on the ground floor â and the patients were accompanied by a sitter. Outpatients also came to SadskÃ¡ for âweekend therapy,â undergoing LSD and individual or group analysis and returning to work on Monday. Like the inpatients, these visitors underwent dozens of treatments: one 42-year-old male received 300 <em>Âµ</em>g 37 times in 18 months.</p><figure><blockquote><p>âTalk openly about everything that comes to mind while using the substance,â Hausner advised. âThe purpose of sitting is not to âextractâ experiences that you would not discuss in a completely awake state.â</p></blockquote></figure><p>Hausner wrote up a guide for patients, introducing them to psycholytic therapy. Many instructions were typical of clinics elsewhere â he advised patients to keep their eyes closed while on LSD and to accept unpleasant or frightening episodes, as they might reveal the sources of their psychological difficulties â but others seemed worded to reassure patients who had lived under totalitarianism. âTalk openly about everything that comes to mind while using the substance,â Hausner advised. âThe purpose of sitting is not to âextractâ experiences that you would not discuss in a completely awake state.â</p><p>He also wrote detailed instructions for the staff. Nurses were to supervise patients filling out the numerous questionnaires, to conduct art and occupational therapy, and to sit with patients during LSD sessions. Some patients might undergo psychotic episodes, he warned: âRemember that kindness, an effort to understand seemingly bizarre behavior, and minimal restraints can usually eliminate even the most violent manifestations.â Any doctor or therapist working with LSD was required to have at least three experiences with the drug themselves so that they could better understand their patients, and nurses had the option to undergo LSD as well. âWhen work started at SadskÃ¡, the personnel took a very skeptical attitude to the whole undertaking,â Hausner told a reporter, but most employees came around. âTheir first eye-opener is that as ânormalâ people they are not so very different from the patients under LSD intoxication. This discovery breaks down the barrier of prejudice in them.â</p><p>The LSD therapy at SadskÃ¡ was also greatly influenced by ZbynÄk HavlÃ­Äek (1922â1969), a psychologist and surrealist poet who had worked at the DobÅany mental hospital in the 1950s and was at SadskÃ¡ when Hausner arrived. Fascinated by psychoanalysis, HavlÃ­Äek considered LSD a âmiracleâ compared to the mind-numbing drugs issued by most psychiatrists, and he ran many of the early psycholytic groups at SadskÃ¡, interviewing patients while they were hallucinating.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="1040" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/hausner-counsels-a-patient.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Milan Hausner counsels a patient in his office at the SadskÃ¡ clinic in 1974. A color photo of the same scene in a popular magazine contributed to the end of LSD psychotherapy in Czechoslovakia. Reproduced courtesy of VladimÃ­r Lammer.</figcaption></figure><p>In letters to his girlfriend, HavlÃ­Äek described his method in detail, playing with patientsâ symptoms âlike a bullfighter, waving a red cloth to their statements,â probing their visions and memories and finding connections in their biographies and patterns of behavior. This LSD analysis apparently worked: Hausner reported that 80 hospitalized patients underwent psycholytic therapy at SadskÃ¡ in 1966, mainly suffering from neuroses, sexual disorders, and psychosomatic syndromes that hadnât responded to other treatments for years, and 47 of them improved enough to be discharged. âThe more sessions, the better the results,â Hausner said: patients who improved significantly had an average of 12 sessions (average dose 250 <em>Âµ</em>g), while those showing no improvement had an average of six.</p><p>This was good news at a time when moral panic about LSD was cresting elsewhere. In April 1966, a few days after the <em>New York Times</em> reported that a man claiming to be âflyingâ on LSD had stabbed his mother-in-law to death, Sandoz announced that it was stopping all distribution of its product, and therapists from the U.S., the UK, Italy, and other countries started visiting the SadskÃ¡ clinic, hoping to buy Lysergamid. Stanislav Grof knew many prominent LSD doctors after presenting his own psycholytic research at a conference in New York, and he brought several of them to SadskÃ¡, including Harvardâs Walter Pahnke. But the panic elsewhere reached Czechoslovakia, too: The communist daily <em>RudÃ© PrÃ¡vo</em> ran an article denouncing LSD as a ânew godâ that had unleashed madness in the West, and Hausner had to respond. No misuse of Lysergamid had occurred in Czechoslovakia, he assured readers; only trained psychiatrists could request the drug after approval by a special committee of the ministry of health. (Hausner was the committee secretary, and he directed foreignersâ inquiries to the state export company.) Besides, LSD was too valuable a tool to be outlawed. The drug was a âprobe into the subconscious,â Hausner wrote â and âthe probe goes very deep, often into the first days of life, if not further.â</p><p>This was an extraordinary claim, especially for the pages of the official Communist Party newspaper, but it did reflect what the doctors were seeing. Hausner reported elsewhere that two-thirds of his LSD patients ârelived phantasies concerning their birth, intrauterine life, âbirth trauma,â [or] first events of the sucking age.â At an October 1966 conference in Amsterdam, Grof theorized that LSD brought forth constellations of emotionally charged, condensed experiences (COEX), individual to each patientâs life, and these earliest memories or fantasies lay at the core of each COEX system, providing a key to understanding the patientâs problems. HavlÃ­Äek, the Freudian, disagreed, arguing that such experiences were merely âa retroprojection of later conflictsâ onto the richly symbolic moment of birth. To Hausner, these were theoretical differences; he was focused on managing his clinic, and he instructed SadskÃ¡âs nurses to comfort patients in a âpediatric regressionâ by âstroking, taking a hand, etc.â â which required âa certain skillâ in distinguishing regression from âadult manifestation on an erotic level.â</p><figure><blockquote><p>HavlÃ­Äek argued that the psychedelic experience was essentially narcissistic and typically American â a retreat into a âluxurious uterus.â</p></blockquote></figure><p>The most fundamental dispute between the doctors, however, occurred over how LSD therapy should be conducted. In 1967, Grof got a fellowship to work at Baltimoreâs Spring Grove State Hospital, which used âpsychedelicâ therapy, giving alcoholics one huge dose of LSD (400 <em>Âµ</em>g or more) to induce a life-changing spiritual experience. Grof started thinking that Europeâs psycholytic advocates were on the wrong track: Repeated sessions of psychoanalysis were time-consuming and couldnât grasp the profound sensations of ego death, rebirth, or cosmic unity that LSD patients often experienced at higher doses, which he saw could be beneficial. HavlÃ­Äek had none of it: He argued that the psychedelic experience was essentially narcissistic and typically American â a retreat into a âluxurious uterus,â providing feelings of divine exaltation but socially worthless, separating the patient from the real world where their problems began, and where they had to learn to survive. Hausner, whoâd been elected vice president of the European Association for Psycholytic Therapy, agreed: âIn my experience,â he later wrote, âachieving true transcendental insight is rare unless the subject succeeds in discarding the negative aspects of his unconscious and erases the faulty programming that is causing the problem.â (To avoid confusion with psychedelic therapy, Hausner usually referred to the drugs as âpsychodysleptics,â meaning that they induced a dreamlike state.)</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="900" height="673" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/hausner-at-sadska.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Hausner and his colleagues at the SadskÃ¡ clinic listen to news of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. In the years following, hardline Communist bureaucrats took an increasingly dim view of LSD psychotherapy.</figcaption></figure><p>Grof prepared a response, proposing a way to integrate psycholytic and psychedelic techniques at an international LSD congress to be held in Prague in September 1968, but the paper was never heard. On August 20, Soviet troops invaded Czechoslovakia to crush the democratic progress emerging during the Prague Spring. Then, on January 7, 1969, HavlÃ­Äek died of leukemia. SadskÃ¡âs fortunes were destined to change after that.</p><hr><p>When Hana K. arrived at SadskÃ¡ in 1970, she spent four months in group therapy while Hausner assessed her. She answered questionnaires and wrote her autobiography, read books by Freud and Erich Fromm, and sat in on discussions about relationships â many of the patients were young and had family conflicts because the state wouldnât assign them apartments of their own unless they were married. Then Hana started the LSD treatments, and by sharing work and experiences with other patients, for the first time in her life she made some friends.</p><p>After 22 sessions, Hausner decided that Hana had improved enough to join a group psycholytic session. Although his early research suggested that group LSD sessions had little value, Hausner found that low doses of the drug helped some patients see their own âfaulty, unbalanced behaviorâ when interacting with others. Hana received 100 <em>Âµ</em>g with half the patients in her group. At first, the experience was unpleasant, like she was being watched on a stage. But soon members of the community started violently arguing with each other â and Hana was flooded with empathy.</p><p>âI am actually beginning to understand and to relate to people,â Hana wrote in her diary. âI can see and understand the reason for the things they do, and I donât hate them anymore! Poor doctor. Heâs got so many children. How can he cope with it all?â</p><p>After the 1968 invasion, it took Czechoslovakiaâs new Soviet-backed government several years to replace key officials with hardline communists, and during that time Hausner was able to continue LSD therapy. Newcomers joined SadskÃ¡, including a psychoanalyst from Poland and a group therapist from Barcelona, and foreigners continued to tour the clinic â R. A. Sandison visited in 1970 â but increasingly from the Soviet bloc, curious about methods unavailable in their own countries. âWe have found your system of contacting LSD groupâs therapy very fascinating,â two Polish psychologists wrote in SadskÃ¡âs guestbook after staying several weeks in the summer of 1969. âWe have seen wonderful results. We have taken LSD ourselves and experienced that it helps very much in speeding up psychotherapy. We would like to arrange LSD groupâs psychotherapy in Poland.â</p><p>To hear the people who worked there describe it, SadskÃ¡ was more like an offbeat arts college than a Soviet medical facility. Hausner brought his three children to the clinic, and sculptors and dream interpreters came from Prague to give classes to the patients. Some evenings, they held masquerades or parties; the doctors and nurses and patients would dance together, and the next day, they would discuss in group how they had interacted. There were a few suicide attempts, but there were also romances: one older LSD patient, who had spent his youth in a Nazi concentration camp and suffered from depression, was so impressed by SadskÃ¡ that after his discharge, he became a therapist at the clinic and married one of the psychiatrists. As one patient later wrote, âAt SadskÃ¡, it was Freud and love.â</p><figure><blockquote><p>There were a few suicide attempts, but there were also romances.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Sadly, that love wasnât felt in the Czech capital. Communists feared that the Western scourge of narcotics addiction was leaking into Czechoslovakia, and in December 1969, the popular magazine <em>KvÄty</em> ran an article about drug abuse by Prague youths, opening with a rumor that LSD could be bought in front of a downtown cinema from a car with Austrian license plates. Hausner increasingly had to defend the psychiatric use of LSD and the distribution scheme that he helped administer. At the prestigious Collegium Internationale Neuropsychopharmacologicum, held in Prague in 1970, he spoke on the âtherapeutic and illegal use of Lysergamideâ: After some 3,000 sessions with 300 patients at SadskÃ¡, he reported that general health improved for 60 percent of them, and life satisfaction increased for 70 percent. âNobody of these 300 patients became habituated to LSD,â he asserted; distribution of the drug was under ârigorous governmental control,â and âno misuse has been observed.â But he was swimming against the tide. In February 1971, 34 countries adopted the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances, classifying LSD as a drug of abuse with no therapeutic value. Czechoslovakia was only an observer of the proceedings, but the Soviet Union soon signed on, and SadskÃ¡ came under scrutiny.</p><p>In May of that year, a panel of doctors conducted a comprehensive audit of the clinic âdue to frequent negative commentsâ from the regional health authority. Hausner prepared a table showing that LSD patients were a small percentage of SadskÃ¡âs admissions, and the time they spent there was decreasing.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2082" height="1138" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/saska.jpg" alt="Sadska admissions table"><figcaption>SadskÃ¡âs admissions and the time patients spent at the clinic.</figcaption></figure><p>The panel commended Hausner for fulfilling the planned number of treatments, his focus on âmodern currentsâ in psychiatry, such as âgroup psychotherapy and active pursuit of cooperation of the patient,â and his âprogressive effortsâ to reduce hospitalization via his âweekendâ LSD therapy. But, â[a]s far as LSD treatment is concerned, we reiterate the fact that this method is not generally accepted. The number of patients treated in this way needs to be limited as much as possible, or to stay with LSD for a few cases that would only go to outpatient treatment.â</p><figure><blockquote><p>Every third or fourth weekend, about 40 patients would endure a âpsycholytic marathon,â taking turns sitting for each other and heading back to work on Monday.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Hausner complied, increasingly putting new LSD patients on weekend therapy. Every third or fourth weekend, about 40 patients would endure a âpsycholytic marathon,â taking turns sitting for each other and heading back to work on Monday. Each of them would have been hospitalized an average of 64 days without the program, Hausner calculated, so it saved the state 1.34 million Crowns per year. (At the time, the average salary in Czechoslovakia was 26,844 Crowns per year.) To save more money, Hausner recruited psychology students to assist on weekends, and many underwent a âtraining intoxicationâ with LSD for university credit.</p><p>Hausner continued to publish articles internationally, including one comparing the symbology of dreams to LSD hallucinations that was subsequently reprinted in a Czech journal for general practitioners. In March 1973, he chaired a conference on psychotherapy in socialist countries that was attended by experts from across the Soviet bloc â although he was careful to mention psycholytic therapy only once in his own paper, surveying the range of techniques used in Czechoslovakia at the time. (For example, Hausner, then president of the psychotherapeutic section of Czech Psychiatric Society, noted that 250 of its 300 members used hypnosis.) In June, he traveled to Oslo for the 9th International Congress of Psychotherapy, where he identified his practice as â<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1975-21534-001" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">dynamic confrontation therapy</a>,â in which a patient faces the problems of past, present, and future (!) in a controlled environment, with psychodysleptic drugs targeting the âneurochemical, intrapsychic, interpersonal, psychosomatic and the valuation system area[s],â and ultimately providing a corrective emotional experience.</p><p>But officials back in Prague were likely suspicious of the relative freedom that Hausner enjoyed without a Communist Party membership. Drug abuse was becoming a problem in Czechoslovakia, and though nearly all the cases involved prescription medicines, often containing ephedrine or codeine, the bureaucrats feared that LSD was next. In October 1973, they inspected the SadskÃ¡ clinic, and in its safe, they found 619 ampoules of LSD that had expired in 1969. In January 1974, they consulted the pharmacy that distributed the drug and learned it had another 2,400 ampoules that Hausner had ordered in 1971 and were about to expire. In a series of letters, Hausner apologized. Supplies from the factory had been unpredictable, he said, and LSD remained stable in glass ampoules for many years. Besides, the drug hadnât been stolen or turned up on the black market, so what was the harm?</p><p>Hausner needed some good press, so he invited journalists from <em>KvÄty</em> to visit SadskÃ¡. The resulting article described a traumatized 18-year-old girl arriving at the clinic, and Hausnerâs plans to treat her with LSD, accompanied by a full-page color photo of Hausner ministering to a female patient lying on a wildly patterned couch in his office under a wall of primitive masks. The deputy director of the regional health authority demanded that LSD therapy be stopped. Hausner apologized again, admitting the photo was âtoo provocative,â and he got letters from other doctors supporting the continued use of LSD. But the health authority ordered Hausner to send reports on every patient receiving the drug, and it started conducting spot checks of the clinicâs supply.</p><p>In the late summer of 1974, Hausnerâs father died, and Hausner had a nervous breakdown. âHe had the worst fears for the future, he was anxious about his family, and concerned about material security,â one of his colleagues later said. Hausner admitted that heâd considered suicide and was hospitalized in Prague for several months. The regional pharmacist came to SadskÃ¡, collected all the ampoules of LSD, and stomped on them in Hausnerâs office.</p><p>âThey took away all his appetite for work,â a nurse said years after this incident. Hausner suffered another breakdown and received treatments from his Prague colleagues that heâd tried to avoid in his own practice, including ECT, antidepressants, and lithium. When he finally returned to SadskÃ¡ in 1975, he was emotionally flattened, a changed man. A nearby hospital took over administration of the SadskÃ¡ clinic and converted the psychotherapeutic pavilion into a ward for chronic psychiatric patients. LSD was still theoretically available with permission from the health ministry, but nobody risked ordering it.</p><p>Hausner left SadskÃ¡ in 1981, after he and Zdena divorced. Czechoslovakia drifted into a stultifying political ânormalization,â and Hausner ended up in the industrial north, providing psychiatry to the employees of a uranium mine. When he died in 2000, Czech medical journals did not mention his passing.</p><hr><p>For many decades, even after the communist regime fell in 1989, Czech medical authorities resisted any talk of reviving LSD therapy, and the few doctors interested in the drug were limited to conducting animal studies. But possibilities are beginning to reopen. Prague psychiatrists are studying the neurobiological effects of psilocybin â in a suite designed to resemble Hausnerâs office as it appeared in <em>KvÄty </em>â and have established a private clinic offering ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, the first in central Europe, although such treatments are not yet covered by Czech medical insurance.</p><p>Hausnerâs correspondence, patient files, and hundreds of pieces of artwork reside in the Czech Academy of Sciences archive, but they are currently inaccessible to the public. Thanks to the growing interest in psychedelics, a book that Hausner wrote in 1997 about psycholytic therapy at SadskÃ¡ has finally been published, but to get a more complete picture of what happened at the clinic, I also sought out people who were there. Some 30 psychiatrists and psychologists worked or trained at the clinic; my colleagues and I interviewed nine of them, and while many said that Hausner was a superb administrator and psychiatrist, they also said that LSD didnât âaccelerateâ psychotherapy because so much time was spent in sessions and analyzing the patientsâ experiences. Several said that therapists were overwhelmed by the volume of material that LSD evoked and Hausner tried to do too much: Many of the LSD patients had neuroses or depression, but the conditions of others ranged from alcoholism to schizophrenia to psychopathy. I also interviewed five SadskÃ¡ nurses, all of whom said that it was the most interesting period of their careers, and the clinic was âlike a big family.â But did LSD therapy help the patients? âWell, they did not come back,â one nurse said. âThey went back to life and everything was OK,â said another. âIt is true that it was a half-year-long treatment. But it was successful, at least according to me.â</p><figure><blockquote><p>One woman said that she felt âbrokenâ after every session and experienced unnerving flashbacks years later.</p></blockquote></figure><p>I also interviewed 15 former SadskÃ¡ patients. Three said that psycholytic therapy hadnât substantially changed their condition, and four said that it made their condition worse. One woman said that she felt âbrokenâ after every session and experienced unnerving flashbacks years later. A man who suffered sexual neuroses said that he didnât consider LSD useful because âit opened everything in allegorical termsâ and confused the therapeutic relationship: In one session, he tried to rest his head in his doctorâs lap, and she rejected him, which took him a long time to overcome. But eight thought that SadskÃ¡âs therapy had helped. A woman who suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and sexual dysfunction said that she was ânewly bornâ after her third session; she had been raised Catholic, and she said that LSD showed her âwhat belief really is.â A male alcoholic said that âLSD made the first stepâ to his sobriety and inspired him to become a therapist for other alcoholics.</p><p>Hana K. was discharged not long after her group LSD session. In 1972, she married a fellow SadskÃ¡ patient, and eventually they had two sons. Today, she says that sheâs become happier as she gets older, and the worst time of her life was just before she went to SadskÃ¡.</p><p>âA home, and kind people around me, that is something I never had before,â she said of the clinic nearly 50 years later. âAnd with LSD they taught me things I never came across anywhere else. But whether the treatment would be equally as successful without LSD I cannot say.â</p><hr><p><em><strong>Ross Crockford</strong> is an award-winning journalist based on Vancouver Island who has written about the medical use of psychedelic drugs for publications in Europe and North America.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike">Rob Pike</a> has described Plan 9 as "an argument" for simplicity and clarity, while others have described it as "UNIX, only moreso."
</span></p>

<p>
<span>From
</span><span><i><a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/names">The Use of Name Spaces in Plan 9:</a> </i></span><span></span></p><ul>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 argues that given a few carefully implemented abstractions it
is possible to produce a small operating system that provides support
for the largest systems on a variety of architectures and networks.
</span></p>
</ul>


<p>
<span>From the
<a href="http://man.9front.org/1/intro"></a></span><a href="http://man.9front.org/1/intro"><span><tt>intro(1)

<ul>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 is a distributed computing environment assembled from
separate machines acting as terminals, CPU servers, and file
servers.  A user works at a terminal, running a window
system on a raster display.  Some windows are connected to
CPU servers; the intent is that heavy computing should be
done in those windows but it is also possible to compute on
the terminal.  A separate file server provides file storage
for terminals and CPU servers alike.
</span></p>
</ul>


<p>
<span>The two most important ideas in Plan 9 are:
</span></p>


<ul><span>â¢
<a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/names">private namespaces</a> (each process constructs a unique view of the hierarchical file system)
</span></ul>

<ul><span>â¢
<a href="http://man.9front.org/5/intro">file interfaces</a> (familiar from UNIX, but taken to the extreme: all resources in Plan 9 look like file systems)
</span></ul>


<p>
<span>Most everything else in the system falls out of these two basic ideas.
</span></p>


<ul><span><i>Plan 9 really pushes hard on some ideas that Unix has that havenât
really been fully developed, in particular, the notion that just about
everything in the system is accessible through a file.  In other
words, things look like an ordinary disk file.  So all the devices are
controlled this way by means of ASCII strings, not complicated data
structures.  For example, you make network calls by writing an ASCII
string, not the files.  This notion is something thatâs actually
leaking quite fast.
</i></span></ul>

<ul><span><i>The second thing is sort of more subtle and sort of hard to appreciate
until youâve actually played with it.  That is that the set of files
an individual program can see depends on that program itself.  In a
standard kind of system, either with Unix remote file systems or
Windows attached file systems, all the programs running in the machine
see the same thing.  In Plan 9, thatâs adjustable per program.  You
can set up specialized name stations that are unique to a particular
program.  I mean, itâs not associated with the program itself but with
the process, with the execution of the process.

<ul>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 is not Unix.  If you think of it as Unix, you may become
frustrated when something doesnât exist or when it works differently
than you expected.  If you think of it as Plan 9, however, youâll find
that most of it works very smoothly, and that there are some truly
neat ideas that make things much cleaner than you have seen before.
</span></p>
</ul>


<p>
<span>Confusion is compounded by the fact that many UNIX commands exist on Plan 9 and behave in similar ways. In fact, some of Plan 9âs userland (such as the
<a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/upas_mail_system"></a></span><a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/upas_mail_system"><span><tt>upas

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170601063844/http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/10thEdMan">Research UNIX 10th Edition.</a> Further investigation reveals that many ideas found in Plan 9 were explored in more primitive form in the later editions of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Unix">Research UNIX.</a> </span></p>

<p>
<span>However, Plan 9 is a completely new operating system that makes no attempt to conform to past prejudices. The point of the exercise (circa the late 1980s) was to avoid past problems and explore new territory. Plan 9 is not UNIX
</span><span><i>for a reason.

<p>
<span>Plan9port consists of a combination of mostly unaltered Plan 9 userland utilities packaged alongside various attempts to imitate Plan 9âs kernel intefaces using miscellaneous available UNIX programs and commands. Some of the imitations are more successful than others. In all, plan9port does not accurately represent the experience of using actual Plan 9, but does provide enough functionality to make some users content with running acme on their Macbooks.

<h3><span><b>0.1.3 - Plan 9 is not for you

<p>
<span><b>Letâs be perfectly honest.
</b></span><span>Many features that todayâs "computer experts" consider to be essential to computing (JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, etc.) either did not exist when Plan 9 was abandoned by its creators, or were purposely left out of the operating system. You might find this to be an unacceptable obstacle to adopting Plan 9 into your daily workflow. If you cannot imagine a use for a computer that does not involve a web browser, Plan 9 may not be for you.

<h2><span><b>0.2 - Why Plan 9?
</b></span><span></span></h2><span></span>

</a><p><a name="0.2">
<span>You may ask yourself, well, how did I get here? In the words of Plan 9 contributor
</span></a><a href="http://swtch.com/">Russ Cox:</a> </p>

<ul>

<p>
<span>Why Plan 9 indeed.  Isnât Plan 9 just another Unix clone?  Who cares?
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 presents a consistent and easy to use interface.  Once youâve
settled in, there are very few surprises here.  After I switched to
Linux from Windows 3.1, I noticed all manner of inconsistent behavior
in Windows 3.1 that Linux did not have.  Switching to Plan 9 from
Linux highlighted just as much in Linux.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>One reason Plan 9 can do this is that the Plan 9 group has had the
luxury of having an entire system, so problems can be fixed and
features added where they belong, rather than where they can be.  For
example, there is no tty driver in the kernel.  The window system
handles the nuances of terminal input.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>If Plan 9 was just a really clean Unix clone, it might be worth using,
or it might not.  The neat things start happening with user-level file
servers and per-process namespace.  In Unix, /dev/tty refers to the
current windowâs output device, and means different things to
different processes.  This is a special hack enabled by the kernel for
a single file.  Plan 9 provides full-blown per-process namespaces.  In
Plan 9 /dev/cons also refers to the current windowâs output device,
and means different things to different processes, but the window
system (or telnet daemon, or ssh daemon, or whatever) arranges this,
and does the same for /dev/mouse, /dev/text (the contents of the
current window), etc.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Since pieces of file tree can be provided by user-level servers, the
kernel need not know about things like DOSâs FAT file system or
GNU/Linuxâs EXT2 file system or NFS, etc.  Instead, user-level servers
provide this functionality when desired.  In Plan 9, even FTP is
provided as a file server: you run ftpfs and the files on the server
appear in /n/ftp.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>We need not stop at physical file systems, though.  Other file servers
synthesize files that represent other resources.  For example, upas/fs
presents your mail box as a file tree at /mail/fs/mbox.  This models
the recursive structure of MIME messages especially well.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>As another example, cdfs presents an audio or data CD as a file
system, one file per track.  If itâs a writable CD, copying new files
into the /mnt/cd/wa or /mnt/cd/wd directories does create new audio or
data tracks.  Want to fixate the CD as audio or data?  Remove one of
the directories.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 fits well with a networked environment, files and directory
trees can be imported from other machines, and all resources are files
or directory trees, itâs easy to share resources.  Want to use a
different machineâs sound card?  Import its /dev/audio.  Want to debug
processes that run on another machine?  Import its /proc.  Want to use
a network interface on another machine?  Import its /net.  And so on.

<p>
<span>Hi! Iâm new to Plan 9. Iâm really excited to work with this
new Linux system.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>I hit some questions.
</span></p><p>
<span>1  How do I run X11?
</span></p><p>
<span>2  Where is Emacs?
</span></p><p>
<span>3  The code is weird. It doesnât look like GNU C at all.
Did the people who wrote Plan 9 know about C?
</span></p><p>
<span>4  I tried to run mozilla but it did not work. How come?
</span></p>
</ul>


<p>
<span>Is this guy you?

<img src="http://fqa.9front.org/belllabs.jpg">


<p>
<span>All of the people who worked on Plan 9 have moved on from Bell Labs and/or
no longer work on Plan 9. Various reasons have been articulated by various people.

<ul>

<p>
<span>I ran Plan 9 from Bell Labs as my day to day work environment until
around 2002.  By then two facts were painfully clear.  First, the
Internet was here to stay; and second, Plan 9 had no hope of keeping
up with web browsers.  Porting Mozilla to Plan 9 was far too much
work, so instead I ported almost all the Plan 9 user level software to
FreeBSD, Linux, and OS X.
</span></p>
</ul>
<p>
<span>Russ Cox
<a href="http://marc.info/?l=9fans&amp;m=126697423223383">(again):</a> </span></p>

<ul>

<p>
<span>The standard set up for a Plan 9 aficionado here seems to
be a Mac or Linux machine running Plan 9 from User Space
to get at sam, acme, and the other tools.  Rob, Ken, Dave, and I
use Macs as our desktop machines, but weâre a bit of an exception.
Most Google engineers use Linux machines, and I know of
quite a few ex-Bell Labs people who are happy to be using
sam or acme on those machines.  My own setup is two
screens.  The first is a standard Mac desktop with non-Plan 9
apps and a handful of 9terms, and the second is a full-screen
acme for getting work done.  On Linux I do the same but the
first screen is a Linux desktop running rio (formerly dhogâs 8Â½).
</span></p>

<p>
<span>More broadly, every few months I tend to get an email from
someone who is happy to have just discovered that sam is still
maintained and available for modern systems.  A lot of the time
these are people who only used sam on Unix, never on Plan 9.
The plan9port.tgz file was downloaded from 2,522 unique
IP addresses in 2009, which I suspect is many more than
Plan 9 itself.  In that sense, itâs really nice to see the tools
getting a much wider exposure than they used to.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>I havenât logged into a real Plan 9 system in many years,
but I use 9vx occasionally when I want to remind myself how
a real Plan 9 tool worked.  Itâs always nice to be back,
however briefly.

<ul>

<p>
<span>&gt; Can you briefly tell us why you (Russ, Rob, Ken and Dave)
</span></p><p>
<span>&gt; no longer use Plan9 ?
</span></p><p>
<span>&gt; Because of missing apps or because of missing driver for your hardware ?
</span></p><p>
<span>&gt; And do you still use venti ?
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Operating systems and programming languages have
strong network effects: it helps to use the same system
that everyone around you is using.  In my group at MIT,
that meant FreeBSD and C++.  I ran Plan 9 for the first
few years I was at MIT but gave up, because the lack of
a shared system made it too hard to collaborate.
When I switched to FreeBSD, I ported all the Plan 9 libraries
and tools so I could keep the rest of the user experience.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>I still use venti, in that I still maintain the venti server that
takes care of backups for my old group at MIT.  It uses
the plan9port venti, vbackup, and vnfs, all running on FreeBSD.
The venti server itself was my last real Plan 9 installation.
Itâs Coraid hardware, but I stripped the software and had installed
my own Plan 9 kernel to run venti on it directly.  But before
I left MIT, the last thing I did was reinstall the machine using
FreeBSD so that others could help keep it up to date.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>If I wasnât interacting with anyone else itâd be nice to keep
using Plan 9.  But itâs also nice to be able to use off the shelf
software instead of reinventing wheels (9fans runs on Linux)
and to have good hardware support done by other people
(I can shut my laptop and it goes to sleep, and even better,
when I open it again, it wakes up!).  Being able to get those
things and still keep most of the Plan 9 user experience by
running Plan 9 from User Space is a compromise, but one
that works well for me.

<ul>

<p>
<span>What Russ says is true but for me it was simpler. I used Plan 9 as my
local operating system for a year or so after joining Google, but it
was just too inconvenient to live on a machine without a C++ compiler,
without good NFS and SSH support, and especially without a web
browser.  I switched to Linux but found it very buggy (the main
problem was most likely a bad graphics board and/or driver, but still)
and my main collaborator (Robert Griesemer) had done the ground work
to get a Mac working as a primary machine inside Google, and Russ had
plan9port up, so I pushed plan9port onto the Mac and have been there
ever since, quite happily.  Nowadays Apples are officially supported
so itâs become easy, workwise.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>I miss a lot of what Plan 9 did for me, but the concerns at work override that.

<h3><span><b>0.2.4 - What is the deal with Plan 9âs weird license?
</b></span><span></span></h3><span></span><br>
<img src="http://fqa.9front.org/intellectualproperty.jpg">


<p>
<span>Over the years Plan 9 has been released under various licenses, to the consternation of many.
</span></p>

</a><p><a name="0.2.3.3">
<span>The first edition, released in 1992, was made available only to universities. The process for acquiring the software was convoluted and prone to clerical error. Many potential users had trouble obtaining it within a reasonable time frame and many complaints were voiced on the eventual
</span></a><a href="http://fqa.9front.org/fqa2.html#2.2.2">Plan 9 Internet mailing list.</a> </p>

<p>
<span>The second edition, released in 1995 in book-and-CD form under a relatively standard commercial license, was available via mailorder as well as through a special telephone number for a price of approximately $350 USD. It was certainly easier to acquire than the first edition, but many potential users still complained that the price was too high and that the license was too restrictive.

<p>
<span>When I saw the announcement that the Plan Nine software had been released
as "open source", I wondered whether it might be free software as well.
After studying the license, my conclusion was that it is not free; the
license contains several restrictions that are totally unacceptable for
the Free Software Movement. (See

<span>In 2014, portions of the Plan 9 source code were again re-licensed, this time under the
</span></a><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GPLv2,</a> for distribution with the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley">University of California, Berkeleyâs</a> <a href="http://akaros.cs.berkeley.edu/akaros-web/">Akaros</a> operating system. Predictably, various parties were not impressed.
</p>

<p>
<span>Russ Cox tried to make sense of the situation by commenting in a
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7232511">Hacker News thread:</a> </span></p>

<ul>

<p>
<span>When you ask "why did big company X make strange choice Y regarding
licensing or IP", 99 times out of 100 the answer is "lawyers". If the Plan
9 group had had its way, Plan 9 would have been released for free under a
trivial MIT-like license (the one used for other pieces of code, like the
one true awk) in 2003 instead of creating the Lucent Public License. Or in
2000 instead of creating the "Plan 9 License". Or in 1995 instead of as a
$350 book+CD that came with a license for use by an entire "organization".
Or in 1992 instead of being a limited academic release.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Thankfully I am not at Lucent anymore and am not privy to the tortured
negotiations that ended up at the obviously inelegant compromise of "The
University of California, Berkeley, has been authorised by Alcatel-Lucent
to release all Plan 9 software previously governed by the Lucent Public
License, Version 1.02 under the GNU General Public License, Version 2." But
the odds are overwhelming that the one-word answer is "lawyers".
</span></p>

<span>Some have suggested that confusion about licensing may have contributed to Plan 9âs failure to supplant UNIX in the wider computing world.

The A350 came to a stop off the right hand edge of the runway about 1680 meters/5510 feet down the runway and was evacuated. All occupants were able to evacuate. The other aircraft carrying 6 people also burst into flames, 5 of the six occupants are confirmed dead. Both aircraft burned down. 14 occupants of the A359 received injuries, the captain of the Dash 8 received serious injuries.<p>The airline reported their A350 was carrying 367 passengers (including 8 children) and 12 crew, all of them evacuated from the aircraft. In a second press release the airline reported there had been no anomaly with the aircraft prior to departure. The crew had received and read back landing clearance. After the collision and coming to a stand still three emergency slides were used to evacuate the occupants of the aircraft. The details of the accident are under investigation by the JTSB.</p><p>Japan's Coast Guard reported their Dash 8-300 registration JA722A (Code MA722) was carrying 6 people, the captain was able to evacuate, the other 5 are currently missing. The aircraft was carrying supplies to their Niigata based where the New Year's Earthquake struck.</p><p>Tokyo's Metropolitan Police reported 5 of the occupants of the Dash 8 are confirmed dead. </p><p>Tokyo's fire department reported, the captain of the DH8C received serious injuries, 17 occupants of the A359 received injuries. Later the Fire Department corrected the number to 14 injuries amongst the occupants of the A359.</p><p>Passengers of the A359 reported the landing appeared normal at first, after touchdown there was a thud and the outside lit up in orange. A first announcement was made "please calm down" followed by "do not take your luggage and do not stand up". There was no clear announcement to evacuate, however, when other passengers stood up they also stood up and thus escaped.</p><p>Japan's Ministry of Transport stated Haneda Airport was closed, the flights cancelled, there is no prediction when the airport will open again.</p><p>In a press conference the Ministry of Transport stated that it is under investigation whether JL-516 had been cleared to land. There was a Coast Guard aircraft on the runway causing a collision, the details of the collision are under investigation. In a graphics the Ministry showed the approximate positions of both aircraft (see below).</p><p>In the afternoon of Jan 2nd 2023 (European Time) the French BEA reported they have dispatched 4 investigators and 5 technical advisors to Tokyo to join Japan's JTSB, who are investigating the accident. The team is expected to be on site by Jan 3rd 2024.</p><p>A number of arriving flights are being diverted to Narita Airport where the flights are being accepted one by one.</p><p>According to ATC recordings the A359 as well as a number of other aircraft departing runway 34R were handed off to Tower Frequency 118.725MHz, however, the Coast Guard DH8C was handed off to tower at 124.350MHz. JL-516, upon being handed off to tower by approach, was told by tower to "continue approach", about 90 seconds later tower cleared the aircraft to land.</p><p>Haneda Airport resumed operations on their runways 16R/34L, 04/22 and 05/23 at about 21:30L (12:30Z) about 3:45 hours after the accident while runway 16L/34R remains closed.</p><p>Related NOTAMs:<br>J0019/24 NOTAMN<br>Q) RJJJ/QMRLC/IV/NBO/A/000/999/3533N13947E005<br>A) RJTT B) 2401021538 C) 2401031500 EST<br>E) RWY 16L/34R-CLSD DUE TO DISABLED ACFT</p><p>E5877/23 NOTAMN<br>Q) RJJJ/QMXLC/IV/M/A/000/999/3533N13947E005<br>A) RJTT B) 2401021530 C) 2401302130<br>D) 02 05 09 12 16 19 23 26 30 1530/2130<br>E) TWY C1 THRU C14-CLSD DUE TO MAINT</p><p>E0023/24 NOTAMN<br>Q) RJJJ/QMXLC/IV/M/A/000/999/3533N13947E005<br>A) RJTT B) 2401020930 C) 2401021500 EST<br>E) TWY C1 THRU C14-CLSD DUE TO TRBL</p><p>J0011/24 NOTAMR J0010/24<br>Q) RJJJ/QMRLC/IV/NBO/A/000/999/3533N13947E005<br>A) RJTT B) 2401021136 C) 2401021300 EST<br>E) ALL RWY-CLSD DUE TO DISABLED ACFT</p><p>E0025/24 NOTAMN<br>Q) RJJJ/QMXLC/IV/M/A/000/999/3533N13947E005<br>A) RJTT B) 2401021144 C) 2401021300 EST<br>E) TWY C(FM C1 TO C14)-CLSD DUE TO TRBL</p><p>E0026/24 NOTAMR E0024/24<br>Q) RJJJ/QMXLC/IV/M/A/000/999/3533N13947E005<br>A) RJTT B) 2401021154 C) 2401031200<br>E) TWY G(BTN C AND H2),G(INT OF H2)-CLSD DUE TO RESCUE OPR</p><p>E0024/24 NOTAMN<br>Q) RJJJ/QMXLC/IV/M/A/000/999/3533N13947E005<br>A) RJTT B) 2401020953 C) 2401021200<br>E) TWY G(BTN C AND H2),G(INT OF H2)-CLSD DUE TO RESCUE OPR</p><p>Metars:<br>RJTT 021000Z 32003KT 9999 R34L/P2000N R22/P2000N R34R/P2000N R05/P2000N FU BKN015 08/04 Q1016 NOSIG RMK 7SC015 A3002 1000E FU ON RWYC-MID=<br>RJTT 020930Z 31007KT 9999 R34L/P2000N R22/P2000N R34R/0900VP2000U R05/P2000N FU BKN015 08/04 Q1016 NOSIG=<br><b>RJTT 020900Z 33008KT 9999 FEW020 07/04 Q1016 NOSIG=</b><br><b>RJTT 020830Z VRB03KT 9999 FEW020 SCT090 08/04 Q1016 BECMG TL0900 30006KT=</b><br>RJTT 020800Z 13003KT 090V150 9999 FEW020 BKN090 09/05 Q1016 BECMG TL0930 30006KT RMK 1CU020 6AC090 A3000=<br>RJTT 020730Z 16007KT 130V190 9999 FEW020 BKN100 08/05 Q1016 NOSIG=<br>RJTT 020700Z 12007KT 9999 FEW030 BKN100 09/04 Q1016 NOSIG=<br>RJTT 020630Z 13010KT 9999 -RA FEW030 BKN070 09/04 Q1016 NOSIG=<br>RJTT 020600Z 14005KT 120V180 9999 -RA FEW030 SCT060 BKN080 08/03 Q1017 NOSIG=<br>RJTT 020530Z 12005KT 9999 -RA FEW025 SCT060 BKN080 08/02 Q1017 NOSIG=<br>RJTT 020500Z 09003KT 050V120 9999 -RA FEW040 BKN060 08/02 Q1017 NOSIG=<br>RJTT 020430Z VRB01KT 9999 -RA FEW030 BKN050 09/01 Q1018 NOSIG=<br>RJTT 020400Z 01003KT 310V060 9999 -RA FEW030 BKN045 09/00 Q1018 NOSIG=</p><p>CCTV Video of line up of Coast Guard (at 2:40 mins), landing of A359 (coming into sight at 3:20 mins) and collision at 3:47 mins (Video: Single Preference):</p><table><tbody><tr><td><iframe width="425" height="350" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6NbVdIoJsHY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NbVdIoJsHY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NbVdIoJsHY</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The A350 skidding to a halt on the runway:<br><img src="http://avherald.com/img/jal_a359_ja13xj_tokyo_240102_1.jpg" width="750" height="447" alt="The A350 skidding to a halt on the runway"></p><p>The aircraft after coming to a halt:<br><img src="http://avherald.com/img/jal_a359_ja13xj_tokyo_240102_2.jpg" width="750" height="336" alt="The aircraft after coming to a halt"></p><p><img src="http://avherald.com/img/jal_a359_ja13xj_tokyo_240102_4.jpg" width="750" height="532" alt="The aircraft after coming to a halt"></p><p>Still out CCTV recording showing the A359 shortly after touchdown, just before and at the moment of collision:<br><img src="http://avherald.com/img/jal_a359_ja13xj_tokyo_240102_3_1.jpg" width="750" height="422" alt="Still out CCTV recording showing the A359 shortly after touchdown"></p><p><img src="http://avherald.com/img/jal_a359_ja13xj_tokyo_240102_3_2.jpg" width="750" height="422" alt="Still out CCTV recording showing the A359 just before collision"></p><p><img src="http://avherald.com/img/jal_a359_ja13xj_tokyo_240102_3_3.jpg" width="750" height="422" alt="Still out CCTV recording showing the A359 just at collision"></p><p>Excerpt of Haneda Aerodrome Chart with positions of aircraft (Graphics: AVH/AIP Japan):<br><img src="http://avherald.com/img/jal_a359_ja13xj_tokyo_240102_map.jpg" width="750" height="221" alt="Excerpt of Haneda Aerodrome Chart with positions of aircraft (Graphics: AVH/AIP Japan)"></p></span></p></div></div>]]></description>

                <p>The powerful earthquake that rocked Ishikawa Prefecture on Monday may have shifted land in the Noto region near the epicenter up to 1.3 meters to the west.</p>
                <p>Japan's Geospatial Information Authority, known as GSI, analyzed GPS data following the 7.6 magnitude quake.</p>
                <p>GSI says preliminary figures indicate that an observation point in Wajima City in Ishikawa Prefecture saw the biggest shift, moving horizontally about 1.3 meters to the west.</p>
                <p>The analysis also indicates a westward shift of about 1 meter in Anamizu Town and 80 centimeters in Suzu City. An observation point in Nanao City's Notojima moved 60 centimeters northwest toward the Sea of Japan coast.</p>
                <p>Land appears to have shifted about 20 centimeters to the northwest in the prefectures of Toyama and Niigata. Several centimeters of land shifts were also observed in the Kanto-Koshin region and elsewhere.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article data-comment-id="140-" id="140-"><span><span><a href="http://antirez.com/user/antirez">antirez</a></span> 3 hours ago. 20882 views.  </span><pre>I'll start by saying that this article is not meant to be a retrospective on LLMs. It's clear that 2023 was a special year for artificial intelligence: to reiterate that seems rather pointless. Instead, this post aims to be a testimony from an individual programmer. Since the advent of ChatGPT, and later by using LLMs that operate locally, I have made extensive use of this new technology. The goal is to accelerate my ability to write code, but that's not the only purpose. There's also the intent to not waste mental energy on aspects of programming that are not worth the effort. Countless hours spent searching for documentation on peculiar, intellectually uninteresting aspects; the efforts to learn an overly complicated API, often without good reason; writing immediately usable programs that I would discard after a few hours. These are all things I do not want to do, especially now, with Google having become a sea of spam in which to hunt for a few useful things.

Meanwhile, I am certainly not a novice in programming. I am capable of writing code without any aid, and indeed, I do so quite often. Over time, I have increasingly used LLMs to write high-level code, especially in Python, and much less so in C. What strikes me about my personal experience with LLMs is that I have learned precisely when to use them and when their use would only slow me down. I have also learned that LLMs are a bit like Wikipedia and all the video courses scattered on YouTube: they help those with the will, ability, and discipline, but they are of marginal benefit to those who have fallen behind. I fear that at least initially, they will only benefit those who already have an advantage.

But let's take it step by step.

# Omniscient or Parrots?

One of the most concerning phenomena of this new wave of novelty and progress in machine learning is the limited ability of AI experts to accept their limited knowledge. Homo sapiens invented neural networks, and then, even more crucially, an algorithm to automatically optimize the parameters of a neural network. Hardware has become capable of training increasingly larger models, and using statistical knowledge about the data to be processed (the priors) and through a lot of trial and error for successive approximations, architectures have been discovered that work better than others. But all in all, neural networks remain quite opaque.

In the face of this inability to explain certain emerging capabilities of LLMs, one would have expected more caution from scientists. Instead, many have deeply underestimated LLMs, saying that after all they were nothing more than somewhat advanced Markov chains, capable, at most, of regurgitating extremely limited variations of what they had seen in the training set. Then this notion of the parrot, in the face of evidence, was almost universally retracted.

At the same time, much of the enthusiastic masses attributed to LLMs supernatural powers that do not exist in reality. Unfortunately, LLMs can, at most, interpolate in the space represented by the data they have seen during training: and this would already be a lot. In reality, their ability to interpolate is limited (but still astonishing, and also unexpected). Oh, if only the largest LLMs of today could interpolate continuously in the space bounded by all the code they have seen! Even if they would not be able to produce true novelties, they would be able to replace 99% of programmers. The reality is more modest, as it almost always is. An LLM is certainly capable of writing programs that it has not seen in that exact form, showing a certain ability to blend different ideas that appeared in the training set with a certain frequency. It is also clear that this ability has, at the moment, deep limits, and whenever subtle reasoning is required, LLMs fail disastrously. Yet they represent the greatest achievement of AI, from its dawn to today. This seems undeniable.

# Stupid but All-Knowing

It's true: LLMs are capable, at most, of rudimentary reasoning, often inaccurate, many times peppered with hallucinations about non-existent facts. But they have a vast knowledge. In the field of programming, as well as in other fields for which quality data are available, LLMs are like stupid savants who know a lot of things. It would be terrible to do pair programming with such a partner (for me, pair programming is terrible even in the most general terms): they would have nonsensical ideas and we would have to continuously fight to impose our own. But if this erudite fool is at our disposal and answers all the questions asked of them, things change. Current LLMs will not take us beyond the paths of knowledge, but if we want to tackle a topic we do not know well, they can often lift us from our absolute ignorance to the point where we know enough to move forward on our own.

In the field of programming, perhaps their ability would have been of very little interest up to twenty or thirty years ago. Back then you had to know a couple of programming languages, the classic algorithms, and those ten fundamental libraries. The rest you had to add yourself, your own intelligence, expertise, design skills. If you had these ingredients you were an expert programmer, able to do more or less everything. Over time, we have witnessed an explosion of frameworks, programming languages, libraries of all kinds. An explosion of complexity often completely unnecessary and unjustified, but the truth is that things are what they are. And in such a context, an idiot who knows everything is a precious ally.

Let me give you an example: my experiments on machine learning were carried forward for at least a year using Keras. Then for various reasons, I switched to PyTorch. I already knew what an embedding or a residual network was, but I didn't feel like studying PyTorch's documentation step by step (as I had done with Keras, which I learned when ChatGPT did not yet exist). With LLMs, it was very easy to write Python code that used Torch. I just needed to have clear ideas about the model I wanted to put together and ask the right questions.

# Time for Examples

I'm not talking about easy things like: "Hey, what's the method of class X to do Y"? If it were just for that, one might be tempted to agree with those who are skeptical about LLMs. What the more complex models are capable of is much more elaborate. Until a few years ago, it would have been pure magic. I can tell GPT4: look, this is the neural network model I have implemented in PyTorch. These are my batches. I would like to resize the tensors so that the function that emits the batches is compatible with the input of the neural network, and I would like to represent things in this particular way. Can you show me the code needed to do the reshaping? GPT4 writes the code, and all I had to do was test in the Python CLI if the tensors really have the dimensions that are useful to me and if the data layout is correct.

Here's another example. Some time ago I had to implement a BLE client for certain ESP32-based devices. After some research, I realized that multi-platform Bluetooth programming bindings are more or less all unusable. The solution was simple, write the code in Objective C using macOS's native API. So, I found myself having to deal with two problems at the same time: learning the cumbersome BLE API of Objective C, full of patterns that I consider nonsensical (I'm a minimalist, that kind of API is at the opposite end of the spectrum of what I consider "good design") and at the same time remembering how to program in Objective C. The last time I had written a program in Objective C was ten years ago: I didn't remember the details of the event loop, memory management, and much more.

The final result is this code here, not exactly beautiful, but it does what it has to do. I wrote it in an extremely short time. It would have been impossible otherwise.

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/antirez/freakwan/blob/main/osx-bte-cli/SerialBTE.m">https://github.com/antirez/freakwan/blob/main/osx-bte-cli/SerialBTE.m</a>

The code was written mostly by doing cut &amp; paste on ChatGPT of the things I wanted to do and didn't quite know how to do, so they didn't work properly. Having the LLM explain to me what the problem was and how to solve it. It's true that the LLM didn't write much of that code, but it's also true that it significantly accelerated the writing. Would I have been able to do it without ChatGPT? Certainly yes, but the most interesting thing is not the fact that it would have taken me longer: the truth is that I wouldn't even have tried, because it wouldn't have been worth it. This fact is crucial. The ratio between the effort and the benefit of writing such a program, secondary to my project, would have been inconvenient. Moreover, this had a much more useful secondary collateral effect than the program itself: for that project I modified linenoise (one of my libraries for line editing) so that it works in multiplexing.

Another example, this time less about code writing and more about data interpretation. I wanted to set up a Python script using a convolutional neural network I found online, but it was quite lacking in documentation. The network had the advantage of being in ONNX format, so I could easily extract a list of inputs and outputs, and their assigned names. I only knew one thing about this convnet: it detected certain features within an image. I didn't know the input image format and size, and especially, the network's output was far more complicated than I imagined (I thought it was a binary classifier: is the observed image okay or does it have problems? Two outputs, but there were hundreds). I began by copy-pasting the ONNX network metadata output into ChatGPT. I explain to the assistant what little I know about the network. ChatGPT hypothesizes how the inputs are organized, and that the outputs are probably normalized boxes indicating parts of the images corresponding to potential defects, and other outputs indicating the likelihood of these defects. After a few minutes of back-and-forth, I had a Python script capable of network inference, plus the necessary code to transform the starting image into the tensor suitable for input, and so on. What struck me about that session was ChatGPT finally âunderstoodâ how the network functioned once it observed the raw output values (the logits, basically) on a test image: a series of floating-point numbers provided the context to identify the exact output details, the normalization, if the boxes where centred or if the left-top corner was specified, and so forth.

# Disposable Programs

I could document dozens of such cases I've narrated above. It would be pointless, as it's the same story repeating itself in more or less the same way. I have a problem, I need to quickly know something that *I can verify* if the LLM is feeding me nonsense. Well, in such cases, I use the LLM to speed up my need for knowledge.

However, there are different cases where I let the LLM write all the code. For example, whenever I need to write a more or less disposable program. Like this one:

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/antirez/simple-language-model/blob/main/plot.py">https://github.com/antirez/simple-language-model/blob/main/plot.py</a>

I needed to visualize the loss curve during the learning of a small neural network. I showed GPT4 the format of the CSV file produced by the PyTorch program during learning, and then I requested that if I specified multiple CSV files on the command line, I didnât want the training and validation loss curves of the same experiment anymore, but a comparison of the validation loss curves of different experiments. The above is the result, as generated by GPT4. Thirty seconds in total.

Similarly, I needed a program that read the AirBnB CSV report and grouped my apartments by month and year. Then, considering the cleaning costs, and the number of nights per booking, it would do statistics on the average rental price for different months of the year. This program is extremely useful for me. At the same time, writing it is deadly boring: there's nothing interesting. So I took a nice piece of the CSV file and did copy-paste on GPT4. I wrote to the LLM what the problem was to be solved: the program worked on the first try. I show it to you in full below.

```python
import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)
df = pd.read_csv('listings.csv')
reservations = df[df['Type'] == 'Reservation']
reservations['Start Date'] = pd.to_datetime(reservations['Start Date'])
reservations['Year'] = reservations['Start Date'].dt.year
reservations['Month'] = reservations['Start Date'].dt.month
reservations['Nightly Rate'] = (reservations['Amount'] - reservations['Cleaning Fee']) / reservations['Nights']
all_listings = reservations['Listing'].unique()
all_years = reservations['Year'].unique()
all_months = range(1, 13)
index = pd.MultiIndex.from_product([all_listings, all_years, all_months], names=['Listing', 'Year', 'Month'])
all_data = pd.DataFrame(index=index).reset_index()
merged_data = pd.merge(all_data, reservations, on=['Listing', 'Year', 'Month'], how='left')
average_nightly_rates = merged_data.groupby(['Listing', 'Year', 'Month'])['Nightly Rate'].mean().fillna(0)
print(average_nightly_rates)
```

To understand exactly how to group the data, which were otherwise quite scattered and disordered, requires some simple reasoning: itâs not a problem that an LLM could solve simply by regurgitating something that approximates the language it has seen. GPT4 has certainly observed similar programs during its training, but almost certainly has not seen a program that had to group things in the exact way I asked for and in a CSV file with that specific format. This shows (in my opinion) that LLMs can interpolate to some extent within the space outlined by the different programs in the training set.

Writing this type of program would be, in my opinion, an imprudent use of my time. The fact that an LLM can do it for me certainly speeds up my ability to produce code in a rather direct way: I can focus on the things that matter.

# When things don't go as they should: System Programming

Despite my success with LLMs and programming, when I write a program in C, I almost always end up using LLMs only as a more convenient form of documentation. I am an expert in system programming, and in that context, LLMs would be useful to me only if they were capable of complex reasoning: in this scenario, they almost always fail.

Let's start with the prompt of this experiment:

Outline the requirements of a nice, small but working C implementation of a bloom filter. Focus on the important aspects of the hashing function. Then write it, in good quality C.

Also consider that your example implementation should be sized to store 100,000 elements, with a false positive probability of at most 5%. The elements added are null-terminated strings.

Hereâs the output:

```c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

#define N 100000  // Number of elements
#define P 0.05    // False positive probability
#define M (int)(-(N * log(P)) / (log(2) * log(2)))  // Size of bit array
#define K (int)(M / N * log(2))  // Number of hash functions

unsigned char bitArray[M / 8 + 1];

void setBit(int n) {
    bitArray[n / 8] |= 1 &lt;&lt; (n % 8);
}

int getBit(int n) {
    return bitArray[n / 8] &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; (n % 8));
}

// Basic hash functions (for demonstration purposes)
int hash1(char *str) {
    int hash = 5381;
    int c;
    while ((c = *str++))
        hash = ((hash &lt;&lt; 5) + hash) + c;
    return abs(hash % M);
}

int hash2(char *str) {
    unsigned long hash = 0;
    int c;
    while ((c = *str++))
        hash = c + (hash &lt;&lt; 6) + (hash &lt;&lt; 16) - hash;
    return abs(hash % M);
}

void add(char *str) {
    setBit(hash1(str));
    setBit(hash2(str));
    // Add more hash functions if needed
}

int is_in(char *str) {
    return getBit(hash1(str)) &amp;&amp; getBit(hash2(str));
    // Check more hash functions if used
}

int main() {
    char *testStr = "testString";
    add(testStr);

    if (is_in(testStr)) {
        printf("%s is probably in the set.\n", testStr);
    } else {
        printf("%s is definitely not in the set.\n", testStr);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The implementation produced by GPT4 is not exactly brilliant. Bloom filters are quite widespread. Itâs not such an exotic data structure. However, itâs clear that writing a decent bloom filter requires a greater capacity for abstraction: for example, thereâs the problem of finding an effective way to hash the same string N times, and being certain that the hashes are sufficiently decorrelated.

Yet if you explicitly ask GPT4 to modify the hashing function so that it produces N decorrelated outputs, its proposed solution is significantly more acceptable:

```c
unsigned int hash(const char* str, unsigned int hash_id) {
    unsigned int hash = 5381;
    int c;
    while ((c = *str++)) {
        hash = ((hash &lt;&lt; 5) + hash) + c + hash_id;
    }
    return hash % BF_SIZE;
}
```

If it had come up with this idea on its own, it would have written the bloom filter differently, setting K bits at a time using a single hashing function.

GPT4 was able to perform, in isolation, the task of writing an appropriate and more generic hashing function. But in the larger project of writing a bloom filter, it failed to show sufficient reasoning ability, and instead spat out two different but similar hashing functions: this is what one would expect from a poorly written article example on bloom filters.

The current weak reasoning abilities of Large Language Models, combined with a possible scarcity of sources on the subject, and even worse, potentially many low-quality sources, collectively result in this meager outcome. Yet, this is not an isolated case. The few times I attempt to use LLMs in the realm of algorithmic or system programming, the results are extremely poor, even when the expected reasoning abilities are not greater than what LLMs seem to possess in contexts like Python programming.

At the same time, GPT-4 is capable of decompiling the function it produced (in a separate session), and also precisely understand its purpose:

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://chat.openai.com/share/f54b64d7-d19a-4be4-8f10-08553aa812f1">https://chat.openai.com/share/f54b64d7-d19a-4be4-8f10-08553aa812f1</a>

Therefore, stating that there are no uses in system programming contexts is certainly inaccurate.

One interesting and pretty much expected thing is that, in these cases, the difference between smaller and larger models is indeed significant. Letâs see how two local models fare.

For instance, Mixtral, the MoE of Mistral, responded to the same question as follows:

```c
unsigned int hash(const char* str, unsigned int hash_id) {
    unsigned int hash = 5381;
    int c;
    while ((c = *str++)) {
        hash = ((hash &lt;&lt; 5) + hash) + c;
    }
    return hash + hash_id;
}
```

Clearly, adding `hash_id` only at the end is an extremely poor solution. Mixtral is an excellent model for many uses, but as for the already weak reasoning capabilities of LLMs, the rule so far is certainly: larger is better.

This is a chat with the local LLM deepseek-coder, quantized to 4 bits as I donât have enough RAM to use the model at higher precision. Yet, being 34 billion parameters large, its reasoning capabilities on this matter seem quite advanced. Hereâs the log of the chat (conducted with llama.cpp):

&gt; I have a hash function that should output N distinct hashes for the same data. However, I'm seeing a very poor distribution of the produced hashes as I change the value of hash_id:

unsigned int hash(const char* str, unsigned int hash_id) {
    unsigned int hash = 5381;
    int c;
    while ((c = *str++)) {
        hash = ((hash &lt;&lt; 5) + hash) + c;
    }
    return hash + hash_id;
}

Maybe the salting strategy I'm using is poor? How could I change it?

[Deep-seek coder reply]

A possible issue with your implementation is that you're simply adding `hash_id` to the end of the hash. This can potentially lead to a poor distribution, especially if `hash_id` is too large or is not evenly distributed.

Consider using bitwise operations for mixing the `hash_id` in. Here is an example with XOR:

```c
unsigned int hash(const char* str, unsigned int hash_id) {
    unsigned int hash = 5381;
    int c;
    while ((c = *str++)) {
        hash = ((hash &lt;&lt; 5) + hash) ^ c + hash_id; // Using XOR to mix in the hash_id
     }
    return (hash ^ hash_id); // Mixing the hash_id one more time at the end
}
```

This will spread `hash_id` throughout your hashes better than simply adding it, which can lead to less uniform distribution. [Snippedâ¦ the actual reply contained more informative stuff]

Not bad for a model running on my MacBook M1 Max. It also mixed the sums with XORs. In this case, the model was certainly helped by the fact that I provided clues about the problem to solve, but it was the model that identified what the real source of the trouble was, and the proposed alternative is valid. Something like the above is not within the reach of any book, documentation, or Google search. And as primitive, a result of interpolation, or however you want to perceive it, the model has performed some form of reasoning, if by reasoning, in this specific case, we accept the identification of the origin of a problem and its potential solution. However one wants to think about LLMs, stating that they are not helpful for programmers is extremely rash.

At the same time, however, my experience over the past few months suggests that for system programming, LLMs almost never provide acceptable solutions if you are already an experienced programmer. Let me show you another real world example. My current project, ggufflib, involves writing a library that reads and writes GGUF format files, which is the format in which llama.cpp loads quantized models. Initially, to understand how the quantization encodings worked (for speed reasons the bits of each quant are stored in fancy ways), I tried using ChatGPT, but then I resolved to reverse engineer llama.cpp's code: it was much faster. An LLM that can decently assist a system programmer, if it sees the data encoding âstructâ declaration and the decoding function, should be able to reconstruct the data format documentation. The functions of llama.cpp were small enough to fit entirely in the context of GPT4, yet the output was completely useless. In these cases, things are done as in the past: paper and pen, reading the code, and seeing where the bits that the decoder extracts are registered.

Let me explain better the above use case so that you can try it yourself, if you wish. We have this structure from llama.cpp implementation.

// 6-bit quantization
// weight is represented as x = a * q
// 16 blocks of 16 elements each
// Effectively 6.5625 bits per weight
typedef struct {
    uint8_t ql[QK_K/2];      // quants, lower 4 bits
    uint8_t qh[QK_K/4];      // quants, upper 2 bits
    int8_t  scales[QK_K/16]; // scales, quantized with 8 bits
    ggml_fp16_t d;           // super-block scale
} block_q6_K;

Then there is this function that is used to perform the dequantization:

void dequantize_row_q6_K(const block_q6_K * restrict x, float * restrict y, int k) {
    assert(k % QK_K == 0);
    const int nb = k / QK_K;

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; nb; i++) {

        const float d = GGML_FP16_TO_FP32(x[i].d);

        const uint8_t * restrict ql = x[i].ql;
        const uint8_t * restrict qh = x[i].qh;
        const int8_t  * restrict sc = x[i].scales;
        for (int n = 0; n &lt; QK_K; n += 128) {
            for (int l = 0; l &lt; 32; ++l) {
                int is = l/16;
                const int8_t q1 = (int8_t)((ql[l +  0] &amp; 0xF) | (((qh[l] &gt;&gt; 0) &amp; 3) &lt;&lt; 4)) - 32;
                const int8_t q2 = (int8_t)((ql[l + 32] &amp; 0xF) | (((qh[l] &gt;&gt; 2) &amp; 3) &lt;&lt; 4)) - 32;
                const int8_t q3 = (int8_t)((ql[l +  0]  &gt;&gt; 4) | (((qh[l] &gt;&gt; 4) &amp; 3) &lt;&lt; 4)) - 32;
                const int8_t q4 = (int8_t)((ql[l + 32]  &gt;&gt; 4) | (((qh[l] &gt;&gt; 6) &amp; 3) &lt;&lt; 4)) - 32;
                y[l +  0] = d * sc[is + 0] * q1;
                y[l + 32] = d * sc[is + 2] * q2;
                y[l + 64] = d * sc[is + 4] * q3;
                y[l + 96] = d * sc[is + 6] * q4;
            }
            y  += 128;
            ql += 64;
            qh += 32;
            sc += 8;
        }
    }
}

If I ask GPT4 to write an outline of the format used, it struggles to provide a clear explanation of how the blocks are stored on the lower / upper 4 bits of âqlâ depending on the weight position. For this blog post, I also tried asking it to write a simpler function that shows how data is stored (maybe it canât explain it with words, but can with code). The produced function is broken in many ways, the indexes are wrong, the 6-bit -&gt; 8-bit sign extension is wrong (it just casts to uint8_t), and so forth.

Btw, this is the code that I ended writing myself:

    } else if (tensor-&gt;type == GGUF_TYPE_Q6_K) {
        uint8_t *block = (uint8_t*)tensor-&gt;weights_data;
        uint64_t i = 0; // i-th weight to dequantize.
        while(i &lt; tensor-&gt;num_weights) {
            float super_scale = from_half(*((uint16_t*)(block+128+64+16)));
            uint8_t *L = block;
            uint8_t *H = block+128;
            int8_t *scales = (int8_t*)block+128+64;
            for (int cluster = 0; cluster &lt; 2; cluster++) {
                for (uint64_t j = 0; j &lt; 128; j++) {
                    f[i] = (super_scale * scales[j/16]) *
                           ((int8_t)
                            ((((L[j%64] &gt;&gt; (j/64*4)) &amp; 0xF) |
                             (((H[j%32] &gt;&gt; (j/32*2)) &amp; 3) &lt;&lt; 4)))-32);
                    i++;
                    if (i == tensor-&gt;num_weights) return f;
                }
                L += 64;
                H += 32;
                scales += 8;
            }
            block += 128+64+16+2; // Go to the next block.
        }
   }

From the function above, I removed what was the actual contribution of this code: the long comments documenting the exact format used by llama.cpp Q6_K encoding. Now, it would be immensely useful if GPT could do this for me, and I bet itâs just a matter of months, because these kind of tasks are within what can be reached without any breakthrough, just with a bit of scaling.

# Putting Things in Perspective

I regret to say it, but it's true: most of today's programming consists of regurgitating the same things in slightly different forms. High levels of reasoning are not required. LLMs are quite good at doing this, although they remain strongly limited by the maximum size of their context. This should really make programmers think. Is it worth writing programs of this kind? Sure, you get paid, and quite handsomely, but if an LLM can do part of it, maybe it's not the best place to be in five or ten years.

And then, do LLMs have some reasoning abilities, or is it all a bluff? Perhaps at times, they seem to reason only because, as semioticians would say, the "signifier" gives the impression of a meaning that actually does not exist. Those who have worked enough with LLMs, while accepting their limits, know for sure that it cannot be so: their ability to blend what they have seen before goes well beyond randomly regurgitating words. As much as their training was mostly carried out during pre-training, in predicting the next token, this goal forces the model to create some form of abstract model. This model is weak, patchy, and imperfect, but it must exist if we observe what we observe. If our mathematical certainties are doubtful and the greatest experts are often on opposing positions, believing what one sees with their own eyes seems a wise approach.

Finally, what sense does it make today not to use LLMs for programming? Asking LLMs the right questions is a fundamental skill. The less it is practiced, the less one will be able to improve their work thanks to AI. And then, developing a descriptive ability of problems is also useful when talking to other human beings. LLMs are not the only ones who sometimes don't understand what we want to say. Communicating poorly is a great limitation, and many programmers communicate very poorly despite being very capable in their specific field. And now Google is unusable: using LLMs even just as a compressed form of documentation is a good idea. For my part, I will continue to make extensive use of them. I have never loved learning the details of an obscure communication protocol or the convoluted methods of a library written by someone who wants to show how good they are. It seems like "junk knowledge" to me. LLMs save me from all this more and more every day.</pre></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Several designs are being tested at <a href="https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/articles/tag/liverpool-street-station/">Liverpool Street station</a>, ranging from large sheets to âpawnsâ that sit behind each seat.</p>
<p>The plain pawns are primarily black, but a blue pawn highlights the accessible seats on the ends of the rows. The other pawns and the solid blocks of sheeting are coloured to match the design of the Elizabeth line seating moquette.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>I'm going to limit my answer to the question, "Why does the
integer representation of a floating point number offer a
piecewise linear approximation to the logarithm?".
The fast inverse square root is a fascinating topic, but I don't
know enough about it to talk about it.</p>
<p>But it's actually pretty easy to answer the question in the title.  First I'll start with the "TL;DR" summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This approximation works because when a number is an exact power of the base, its logarithm is (trivially) exactly its exponent when expressed in exponential notation.  Floating-point notations like IEEE-754 <em>are</em> base-2 exponential notations, and the exponent occupies almost the highest-precision bits of the format, excepting only the sign bit, which is 0 for positive numbers and so can be ignored.  And all of lower-precision bits (that is, beneath the exponent) form a perfectly linear progression, notionally from 000 to 999, due in part to the fact that IEEE-754 formats use normalized significands with a "hidden" leading 1 bit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The longer explanation starts with a review: What do we mean by a <em>logarithm</em>?
Well, it's the inverse of the exponential or power function.
Exponentials say things like, ten to the second power
(10<sup>2</sup>) is 100.  So the (base 10) logarithm function
asks things like, What power do we have to raise 10 to to get the
number 100?  The answer, of course, is 2.</p>
<p>You can also ask things like, "What power do we have to raise 10 to to get the
number 50?"  That's obviously harder, because 50 isn't an even
power of 10.  There's some very cool math behind this which I am
not going to try to explain, but raising things to fractional
powers is defined in such a way that 10<sup>1.69897</sup> is 50.
So the log (base 10) of 50 is 1.69897.</p>
<p>And then you don't have to limit yourself to powers of 10, either.
Mathematicians like to use powers of the special number <em>e</em>
(2.71828), and of course computer programmers love (just love) to
use powers of 2.  What power do we have to raise 2 to in order to
get the number 32?  Every computer geek knows it's 5.  So the log
(base 2) of 32 is 5.</p>
<p>And then there's scientific notation.  Let's take the number 12345.
One way of representing that in scientific notation is 1.2345
Ã 10<sup>4</sup>.  And it turns out that gives us a hint as
to what the base-10 logarithm of 12345 is.  It's going to be
greater than or equal to 4, and less than 5.  (In fact it's about 4.09149.)
This works as long as we pick scientific representations that are
<em>normalized</em> in a certain way, with the <em>significand</em> part
(popularly called the "mantissa") chosen to be
between 1 and 10.  (That is, we wouldn't get a good estimate of
the logarithm in this way if we'd looked at the otherwise-equivalent
notations 0.12345 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> or 12.345 Ã 10<sup>3</sup>.)</p>
<p>So now let's turn to computer floating-point representations.
These typically use â and IEEE-754 definitely uses â base-2
(binary) exponential representations, that is, with normalized
significand values multiplied by some power of 2.  For example,
the number 1.125 is represented as 1.125 Ã 2<sup>0</sup>,
the number 25.25 is represented as 1.578125 Ã 2<sup>4</sup>,
and the number 0.1875 is represented as 1.5 Ã 2<sup>-3</sup>.</p>
<p>And, just as for base 10, those exponents give us a rough,
integer-only approximation of the base-2 logarithm â again,
as long as we use normalized significands, in this case between 1 and 2.
So log<sub>2</sub>(25.25) is going to be somewhere between 4 and 5.</p>
<p>It's also time for me to foreshadow
a super-special secret fact implied by the fact that
we're restricting ourselves to normalized significand values.
I said they were going to be "between 1 and 2", but more
precisely, they're going to range from 1.00000 to 1.99999.
But notice that no matter what the significand value is,
for base 2 <em>the first digit is always going to be 1</em>.
In a minute we'll see what we can do with that.</p>
<p>The IEEE-754 binary floating-point representations all consist of
a sign bit, followed by some number of exponent bits, followed
by some number of significand bits.  For example, for our number
25.25, we're going to have a 0 bit representing a positive sign,
followed by some representation of the exponent 4, followed by
some representation of the significand 1.578125.</p>
<p>But now we're getting a glimmer of how the raw-bits
interpretation of a floating-point number might have something to
do with a logarithm.  For positive numbers we don't have to worry
about the sign bit (since it's 0), and the next thing we see is
going to be the exponent, and we've already seen that the
exponent is a rough (integer-only) approximation of the
logarithm.  So all that's left to ask is, how are we going to
interpolate between the power-of-two values that have exact
base-2 logarithms
(log<sub>2</sub>(8) = 3, log<sub>2</sub>(16) = 4,
log<sub>2</sub>(32) = 5, etc.)
and the fractional ones in between?</p>
<p>If I gave you evenly-spaced numbers like 100, 200, 300 and asked
you to fill in the numbers in between, you'd have little trouble:
you'd replace the 00 part by 01, 02, 03, ..., up to 99.
And if you knew anything about binary numbers,
and I asked you do do the same for evenly-spaced binary numbers like</p>
<pre><code>00100000
01000000
01100000
10000000
</code></pre>
<p>you could do more or less the same thing, replacing the <code>00000</code>
part by consecutive binary numbers <code>00001</code>, <code>00010</code>, <code>00011</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Remarkably enough, we're about to see that something <em>exactly
like this</em> goes on when we encode significand values in IEEE-754
floating-point numbers.</p>
<p>Let's start looking at an actual IEEE-754
floating-point format.  We'll use single-precision float32, to
keep the numbers halfway reasonable.  This format uses 1 bit for
the sign (S), 8 bits for the exponent (e), and 23 bits for the
significand (s):</p>
<pre><code>S e e e e e e e e s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s
</code></pre>
<p>Let's start figuring out what the representations of the numbers
16.000 = 2<sup>4</sup> and 32.000 = 2<sup>5</sup> would look like.</p>
<p>16 is 1.0 Ã 2<sup>4</sup>.  So the significand is 1.0, and the
exponent is 4.  How will these be stored?  I'm going to
concentrate on the significand first.  Remember the observation
that the first digit (the one to the left of the decimal point)
is always 1?  IEEE-754 takes the position that this always-1 leading bit <em>does not need to be stored at all</em>.  The
actual bits stored for a significand of 1.0 will be 00000.
The exponent will be some representation of 4.  So I'm going to
represent the number 16.000 like this:</p>
<pre><code>0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
</code></pre>
<p>Those "4"s are approximate; I still haven't gotten around to
explaining how the exponent is encoded.</p>
<p>The number 32.000 is similar â actually, it's identical, except
for the exponent:</p>
<pre><code>0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
</code></pre>
<p>But the key point I'm building up to is that the numbers in
between â those greater than 16.0, but less than 32.0, will all
be variations on</p>
<pre><code>0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
</code></pre>
<p>except with the 0's replaced by all the consecutive 23-bit binary
numbers â all 2^23 or 8388608 of them â from 000â¦001 up to 111â¦111.</p>
<p>So now we've got just about all the pieces in place to see how
"the
integer representation of a floating point number offers a
piecewise linear approximation to the logarithm".  We've shown
that the binary representations of the numbers between 16 and 32
form a nice, linear ramp from a number that starts with something
like 4, to a number that starts with something like 5.</p>
<p>I've been ducking the question of how the exponents are encoded.
That's done using a <em>bias</em> scheme.  For binary32, the bit pattern
stored is the actual exponent value, plus 127.  So our exponent
value of 4 will be stored as a bit pattern of 4+127=131, and 5
will be stored as 132.  So the <em>actual</em> encodings of 16.0 and
32.0 will be</p>
<pre><code>0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
</code></pre>
<p>where I have filled in the binary values of the encoded exponents 131 and 132, namely
<code>10000011</code> and <code>10000100</code>.  And now we can see the actual, raw values</p>
<p><code>01000001100000000000000000000000</code> and
<code>01000010000000000000000000000000</code>, or <code>0x41800000</code> and
<code>0x42000000</code>, or 1098907648 and 1107296256.</p>
<p>Those numbers don't have anything obvious to do with the base-2
logarithms of 16 and 32 (namely, 4 and 5), but they're actually
very close.  They're offset by the effect of the bias, and
they're completely wrong in magnitude.  But that's not surprising:
by taking 32-bit quantities and treating them as integers, we're
getting big numbers (which are indeed integers), but the actual
values for these logarithms should be 4.0 and 5.0, and we'd like
the possibility of a fractional part.  So if we're going to treat
these big integers as some rendition of the logarithms of some
other, smaller numbers, it's going to involve something very much
like a <em>fixed-point</em> representation.</p>
<p>Deriving the details of that fixed-point representation is
straightforward: the scaling factor is clearly 2<sup>23</sup> =
8388608, and there's also an offset, corresponding to the bias
built in to the binary32 format.  That offset will be 1065353216
(127 Ã 2<sup>23</sup>)
if applied before scaling, or 127 afterwards.</p>
<p>Let's see if this works.  We have come up with integer values of
1098907648 and 1107296256 corresponding to 16.0 and 32.0.  So:</p>
<pre><code>(1098907648 - 1065353216) / 8388608 = 4
(1107296256 - 1065353216) / 8388608 = 5
</code></pre>
<p>or the other way:</p>
<pre><code>1098907648 / 8388608 - 127 = 4
1107296256 / 8388608 - 127 = 5
</code></pre>
<p>So it's working!</p>
<p>It's said that a picture is worth 1,000 words, and it's long past time to do some of this explaining that way.  Here's a graph which â not coincidentally â looks an awful lot like the one you posted from Mitchell 1961:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xyiit.gif" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xyiit.gif" alt="graph of log2(x), and piecewise linear approximation"></a></p>
<p>The red curve is the actual base-2 log function.  The black dots are the places where log<sub>2</sub>(X) is an integer.  Those are the points where the raw bits of a binary32 float value, interpreted as an integer and suitably scaled, are exactly equal to log<sub>2</sub>.  And then in blue we have straight line segments directly connecting those points.</p>
<p>To recap: If we take the raw bits of binary32 float values corresponding to exact powers of 2, we get:</p>

<p>An exact power of two has a significand of 1.0 (that is, these numbers are all 1.0 Ã 2<sup>N</sup>), meaning that they are encoded in IEEE-754 as all 0's (due to the "hidden 1 bit" property).
And since they're positive, their sign bit is 0 also, and the only part that isn't 0 is the exponent.  And since for exact powers the exponent <em>is</em> the logarithm, for these numbers, the integer interpretation of the raw bit pattern is always exactly the logarithm, after shifting and scaling.  (I presume that some aspect of that "shifting and scaling" is where the magic number 0x5f37642f comes in.)</p>
<p>And then, for all the numbers that aren't exact powers of 2, and for which the logarithm isn't an integer, the way the significand values are laid out means that the raw values (as shown by the blue lines in the plot above) form a perfect linear interpolation between the exact powers.  Therefore, in (almost) all cases, the raw bit patterns do indeed end up being a "piecewise linear approximation to the logarithm".  (I said "almost" because this result does <em>not</em> hold for the subnormals, and for the special values Inf and NaN.)</p>
<p>The other interpretation of the question "Why" is, "Why did the designers of IEEE-754 set things up this way?"  I don't believe it was deliberate, that is, I don't believe that it was a requirement that the raw bit pattern, interpreted as an integer, corresponded to a piecewise linear approximation of the base-2 logarithm.  However, given these three related facts:</p>

    <h2>
      <a href="https://updown.io/blog">Blog</a> <em>&nbsp;ã</em>The funny rules of SpamAssassin in 2023 (deep dive)
    </h2><p>This investigation was surprising to me so I thought it would be interesting to share my findings and I hope you'll like it.</p>

<p>Some of my clients occasionally reported that the updown confirmation email (used to confirm a new email address, provided by <a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/blob/main/app/views/devise/mailer/confirmation_instructions.html.erb">Devise</a>) had been classified as spam, we're talking about this one:</p>

<p><img src="https://updown.io/files/655b30f9893e4ad2c794f3c4.png" alt="confirmation email screenshot"></p>

<p>Doesn't look too spammy so far but sometimes mails servers running <a href="https://spamassassin.apache.org/">SpamAssassin</a> were indeed reporting a rating above 5 on its "Spam-Score". 5 being the default threshold from SpamAssassin to consider an email as spam. If we have access to the raw email with headers, this is something we can often see easily (real example provided by one client):</p>
<div><pre><code><span>X-Spam-Report</span><span>:</span><span> 
    *  0.0 HTML_MESSAGE BODY: Nachricht =?UTF-8?Q?enth=E4lt?= HTML
    *  2.8 HTML_IMAGE_ONLY_28 BODY: HTML: images with 2400-2800 bytes of words
    * -0.0 T_SCC_BODY_TEXT_LINE No description available.
    *  4.0 URI_PHISH Phishing using web form</span>
<span>X-Spam-Score</span><span>:</span><span> 6.8</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So I started investigating why SpamAssassin was applying these rules to this email and oh boy I wasn't ready for what I found ð</p>

<p>I first tried reproducing the problem locally by installing SpamAssassin and running some checks on the exact same email from that client (example instructions used on Ubuntu 22.04):</p>
<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>spamassassin
<span>
</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span>spamassassin <span>-V</span>
<span>SpamAssassin version 3.4.6
  running on Perl version 5.34.0

 1.0 URI_PHISH              Phishing using web form
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Dissapointingly the result was very different and the score very low. We could still see the same impacting rules though (<code>HTML_IMAGE_ONLY_28</code> and <code>URI_PHISH</code>) but with lower scores.</p>

<p>I also tried with the <code>-Lt</code> options which means "local-only test" (no calls to remote servers, online blacklists, etc.) and in that case there's fewer tests as expected but it <strong>increases</strong> the score of others:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span><span> </span>spamassassin <span>-Lt</span> &lt; confirmation-instructions.eml

 2.8 HTML_IMAGE_ONLY_28     BODY: HTML: images with 2400-2800 bytes of

 1.0 URI_PHISH              Phishing using web form
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is likely to make up for the fact that there's less signal to be used so they need to amplify the only available signals in order to reach the spam score threshold of 5 earlier, I guess.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you do/can have a local DNS resolver, I would recommend making sure you enable <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/spamassassin/UsingNetworkTests">network rules</a> for more reliable results. If using <code>spampd</code>, this is configured with <code>LOCALONLY=0</code>  in <code>/etc/default/spampd</code> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So even though the scores were lower, I knew they could be multiplied for some reasons and also by configuration so better see if I can avoid the email being flagged as <code>HTML_IMAGE_ONLY_28</code> and <code>URI_PHISH</code> entirely to eliminate the problem.</p>

<p>I first wrote a quick way to test these emails spam scores in my specs (using <code>spamd</code> the daemon version of SpamAssassin, and <code>spamc</code> the command-line client). In order to be able to iterate and test changes quickly, but also to <strong>avoid regressions in the future</strong>. Future changes of my emails or future versions of SpamAssassin:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>spam_check</span> <span>email</span>
  <span># Using spamc/spamd (daemon) if available, much faster</span>
  <span>cmd</span> <span>=</span> <span>"spamc --full --connect-retries=1"</span>
  <span># Using spamassassin (standalone cmd), slower but supports local-only option</span>
  <span># cmd = "spamassassin -Lt"</span>

<p>Now let's have a look at these two rules. It's hard to find clear definitions sometimes but fortunately SpamAssassin is <a href="https://github.com/apache/spamassassin">open source</a> so where there is a will there's a way.</p>

<h3>HTML_IMAGE_ONLY_24</h3>

<p>This  one is the easiest and the most self-explanatory, it simply checks if the email contains an image (it does, the updown.io logo) and if the content is between 2000 and 2400 bytes. So basically if the email is short and has an image, it's more likely to be spam (this is because of spam email which hide text as images to avoid filters). Only two options here:<br>
1. Remove the image<br>
2. Increase the content length</p>

<p>I choose the later to keep a consistent look and also because of the second rule. In the end I only increased it a bit and now it matches the <code>HTML_IMAGE_ONLY_32</code> rule, this rule scores <strong>2.2</strong> in local-only testing but <strong>0</strong> (surprisingly) when network test are enabled. (If we follow the same logic as <code>HTML_IMAGE_ONLY_24</code>, it should have been 2.2/4 â 0.55)</p>

<p>Getting rid of this rule would require much more text bloat or cheating (invisible text, etc..) and it matches more of my emails, so for the moment I decided to leave it like that and wait for the next problem. 2.2 is not enough on it's own to trip the spam threshold (5) and hopefully spamassassin will improve this part before I need to hack around it.  </p>

<h3>URI_PHISH</h3>

<p>Now for the most interesting part, after some online search I first <a href="https://spamassassin.apache.org/full/3.4.x/doc/Mail_SpamAssassin_Plugin_Phishing.txt">found this</a> which seems to be a plugin checking for URL against a blacklist, but it gives the <code>URI_PHISHING</code>  rule (not exactly the same) and I didn't install any plugin, so this is not the one.</p>

<p>I then found this <a href="https://bz.apache.org/SpamAssassin/show_bug.cgi?id=7940">very interesting report</a> in 2021 about a similar confirmation email receiving a "false positive" classification as <code>URI_PHISH</code>, and the official answer was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It's not based on "phishing URLs" or the specific link, it's based on having body text that looks like account phishing and having a URL.  The body text that looks suspiciously like phishing is, unsurprisingly, "confirm your account".</em></p>

<p><em>As Loren said, this is not a FP, as the total score for the message did not exceed the spam threshold. This is a single-rule hit on spammy-looking content without other signs to support it. That happens.</em></p>

<p><em>It is not a bug that a given rule will hit some ham. The only suggestion I can offer is that you reword your message to make it look less like phishing.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So let's skip over the fact that it is now very sad that anti-spam filters have to block any simple confirmation email just because scamers are successfully abusing people with them...</p>

<p>That piqued my curiousity: what are they looking for in the email exactly? how can I make sure that the change I make won't be matched by another rule or in the future? (yes we unfortunately have to think like scammers now in order to get our regular email accepted...)</p>

<p>So by searching for <code>URI_PHISH</code> into the code I ended up in this <a href="https://github.com/apache/spamassassin/blob/773338709e3a4e53380ec9b7ef530af5f115d5ed/rulesrc/sandbox/jhardin/20_misc_testing.cf#L1340">big rules file</a> which does contain this (extract slightly simplified):</p>

<p>Ok so we now have an entry point which contains <strong>MANY</strong> other rules of course (some of which also contains other rules). I checked <strong>ALL</strong> of them for you ^^ and here are my most interesting findings:</p>

<h4>First in the positive rules, which needs to be true:</h4>

<ul>
<li><code>__HAS_ANY_URI</code> â simple regexp on <code>/^\w+:\/\//</code></li>
<li><code>__EMAIL_PHISH || __ACCT_PHISH</code> â these the sub rules where the main "phishing" heuristics happens<br>

<ul>
<li><code>__WEBMAIL_ACCT</code>, <code>__MAILBOX_FULL</code>, <code>__MAILBOX_FULL_SE</code>, <code>__CLEAN_MAILBOX</code>, <code>__VALIDATE_MAILBOX</code>, <code>__VALIDATE_MBOX_SE</code>, <code>__UPGR_MAILBOX</code>, <code>__LOCK_MAILBOX</code>, <code>__SYSADMIN</code>, <code>__ATTN_MAIL_USER</code>, <code>__MAIL_ACCT_ACCESS1</code>, <code>__MAIL_ACCT_ACCESS2</code>, <code>__ACCESS_REVOKE</code>, <code>__PASSWORD_UPGRADE</code>, <code>__PENDING_MESSAGES</code>, <code>__RELEASE_MESSAGES</code>, <code>__PASSWORD_EXP_CLUMSY</code> â these are all regexps for typical email scams (mailbox full, click here to regain access to your account, etc...), nothing matching in my email.</li>
<li><code>__PDS_FROM_NAME_TO_DOMAIN</code> â ï¸ this one is interesting, it triggers if the <strong>From name</strong>  is equal to the <strong>To domain</strong> (for example if the emails is From âexample.comâ To "<a href="mailto:adrien@example.com">adrien@example.com</a>"). â this is because many scam use that to make it look like the email comes from your "domain administrator". It wasn't the case for me here, but make sure you don't do that.</li>
<li><code>__VERIFY_ACCOUNT</code> â â this is the one matching our email so I had to change the wording to avoid it. The regexp is: <code>/(?:confirm|updated?|verif(?:y|ied)) (?:your|the) (?:(?:account|current|billing|personal|online)? ?(?:records?|information|account|identity|access|data|login)|"?[^\@\s]+\@\S+"? (?:account|mail ?box)|confirm verification|verify k?now|Ihre Angaben .berpr.ft und best.tigt)/i</code></li>
<li><code>__FAILED_LOGINS</code>, <code>__ACCOUNT_REACTIV</code>, <code>__SECURITY_DEPT</code>, <code>__ACCOUNT_ERROR</code>, <code>__ACCOUNT_DISRUPT</code>, <code>__ACCOUNT_UPGRADE</code>, <code>__ACCOUNT_SECURE</code>, <code>__SUSPICION_LOGIN</code>, <code>__ACCESS_SUSPENDED</code>, <code>__ACCESS_RESTORE</code>, <code>__ACCESS_REVOKE</code> â another set of regexp for classic account scams based on fear, I made sure my "account locked" email does not match any of those.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Now let's look at all the negative rules here (starting with a <code>!</code>) which are meant to exclude content (if this rule is true, then the <code>URI_PHISH</code> rule will NOT apply):</h4>

<ul>
<li><code>!__URI_GOOGLE_DOC</code> and  <code>!__URI_GOOG_STO_HTML</code> â regexp on <code>docs\.google\.com</code> and <code>storage\.googleapis\.com</code>, they got their own special rule so are excluded here.</li>
<li><code>!ALL_TRUSTED</code> â this is for when you configure some internal email servers as "trusted", not applicable here</li>
<li><code>!__UNSUB_LINK</code> â â ï¸ Also interesting, this one tries to match unsubscribe links with <code>/\b(?:(?:un)?subscri(?:ber?|ptions?)|abuses?|opt(?:ing)?.?out)\b/i</code>. This is good to know that simply having an unsubscribe link could prevent <code>URI_PHISH</code>, but unfortunately for an account confirmation email you can't really "unsubscribe" people, this is not a mailing list or on-boarding email. Otherwise this would have a been a good option to improve both the spam score and the user experience.</li>
<li><code>!__VIA_ML</code> â this rule checks if the envelope-from/return-path contains "bounces@" to declare this is a "Mailing List". In my case using <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</a> this is the case and cannot be customized unfortunately (only the domain: <code>pm_bounces@bounce.updown.io</code>). So I guess you should avoid using "bounces@" in your return path addresses for transactional emails if you can... </li>
</ul>

<h4>And now let's have a look at my favorites: the totally WTF rules ð±:</h4>

<ul>
<li><code>!__TAG_EXISTS_CENTER</code> â this rule just checks for the presence of a <code>&lt;center&gt;</code> tag. So if you add one, magically your email is no longer <code>URI_PHISH</code>... WAIT, WHAT? Surely if your email is centered the old way, then it's not phishing (tested locally).</li>
<li><code>!__HAS_SENDER</code> â if you add ANY <code>Sender</code> header, the <code>URI_PHISH</code> rule is skippedâ¦ The goal of the Sender header is for services sending emails on behalf of other users, it helps for authentication validations. But anybody can put anything in here, so there's no reason to consider an email "less phishing" because it contains this header. (tested locally)</li>
<li><code>!__CAN_HELP</code> â  even simpler, this will skip the rule if the email contains "can help"... (tested locally)</li>
<li><code>!__UPPERCASE_URI</code> â pretty self-explanatory</li>
<li><code>!__HAS_CC</code> â what? why?</li>
<li><code>!__NUMBERS_IN_SUBJ</code> â OK so more than 3 digits in subject line also helps...  <code>/\d{3}/</code></li>
<li><code>!__FB_COST</code> â this is one checks for  the word... "cost". Yep, just that. Put it in an email and suddenly it's not phishing... (tested locally) </li>
<li><code>!__FB_TOUR</code> â similarly this one checks for the word "tour"...</li>
</ul>

<p>It's likely that some of these rules are only here to replace <code>URI_PHISH</code> by another one more specific maybe (like we saw the case with Google Doc URLs), but still in this state it's pretty easy to exploit them and in my testing locally, using those words to trigger those rules didn't cause other spam rules to appear...</p>

<p>Which means that in the end we have a spam filter which is very easy to fool, yet easily tripped by honest emails...</p>

<h3>What I changed in the end</h3>

<ol>
<li>I tried changing the <strong>return-path</strong> to avoid "bounces@" but couldn't do it with Postmark unfortunately.</li>
<li>I did not want to ~use~ <strong>exploit</strong> any of the stupid hacks like "cost" or "&lt;center&gt;".</li>
<li>I changed the <strong>wording</strong> of the email to make it longer and avoid the common word combinations matched in the regexp (see screenshot below for the new version)</li>
<li>I also added a <code>Sender</code> header (only for some emails and with the same value as <code>From</code>) in order to please the rules because this one doesn't look too hackish, but I still don't feel great about this ð.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Over 13 years, one man stole $2.3 million in fares from Edmonton LTR one coin at a time using a car antenna and magnet. </h2>

<p>Maintaining public transit ticket machines is crucial to keeping cities moving but not a job that would normally generate headlines. That is unless youâre Salim Kara, who for 13 years used a car antenna and magnet to pilfer $ 2.3 million of fares from Edmontonâs LTR, one coin at a time. Finally caught in 1994, Salimâs <a href="https://www.nofreelunch.co.uk/blog/what-is-salami-slicing-scam/">salami-slicing style scam</a> had netted him 37 tonnes of small change and minor celebrity status. Hereâs the fascinating story of Salim Karaâs coin scam in full.</p>



<p>Originally from Uganda but of East Indian descent, Salim Kara fled Idi Aminâs regime in 1972 for England, eventually migrating to Canada and settling in Edmonton, the capital of the province of Alberta. </p>



<h2>Magnet fishing for coins</h2>



<p>In 1981, Kara was hired on a $ 38k-a-year salary to maintain and fix the 68 ticket machines of Edmontonâs LRT â light rail transit system. From the get-go, it seems Salim wasnât satisfied with being paid $17.66 per hour, so began supplementing his pay by pilfering a portion of the fares.</p>



<p>As Kara only maintained the machine function, he didnât have direct access to the cash box where the coins were collected after customers had fed them to purchase LRT tickets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working alone and at night, he developed a simple yet ingenious method for fishing those coins out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He removed the face plate from the ticket machines, which as a repairman would raise no suspicion, then rigged a car antenna with a magnetic tip, like a make-shift fishing rod. Coin-by-coin, Kara hooked his catch out of the ticketing machine cash box into a shaving bag, which acted as his keep net.</p>



<p><strong>Banking his heavy booty</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.nofreelunch.co.uk/blog/what-is-salami-slicing-scam/">Salami-slicing scams</a> focus on stealing tiny amounts of money in the hope that the size of the theft makes it unnoticeable. <a href="https://www.nofreelunch.co.uk/blog/what-was-coin-clipping/">Coin clipping</a>, the removal of small slithers of silver or gold coins, is the original salami-slicing scam, dating back to Roman times, but ended around the 17th century as coin designs became more sophisticated and eventually of no intrinsic value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The digital age opened up a new era of salami-slicing opportunities, the best of which weâve summarised in a separate article on computer crimes, but it is unusual for modern salami-slicing type scams to focus on coins.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nofreelunch.co.uk/blog/why-cash-is-more-anonymous-than-crypto/">Cash is king where organised criminals are concerned</a>, given its untraceable nature, but their preference is for high-value bank notes. </p>



<p>Salim Kara was no King Pin; just a petty criminal with a unique gift and the patience to play the long game, quietly siphoning coins day by day over more than a decade and creating a convincing cover story to enable him to launder the proceeds.</p>



<p>Kara told his bank that he ran a successful machine-vending business. News reports estimated that he stole an average of $3k a week over 13 years, but Karaâs scheme received a boost in 1987 when Canada introduced the $1 loonie, almost doubling his weekly take.</p>



<p>Like an urban pirate, soon Kara was lugging $900 home daily in loot and around $5k a week. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Such was the scale of coins that Kara accumulated that his bank allowed him to drag his booty through the back door and even considered expanding their vault to accommodate the volume of coinage Kara was regularly hauling in.</p>
<cite>Edmonton Journal, December 2010</cite></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Karaâs coin-powered property empire</strong></h2>



<p>Over time the proceeds from Salim Karaâs scam began to pile up, so he began investing, including a house in Victoria and two other houses in Edmonton. He also sunk $ 1 million into a term deposit but could crucially keep his distance from these visible signs of wealth.</p>



<p>Perhaps one of the main reasons why Kara could maintain his grift so long was being smart enough to keep a low profile locally, helped by the image he presented driving a dilapidated 1977 Chevrolet Malibu.</p>



<p>Sooner or later, the temptation to spend became too much and maybe thinking he would never get caught in 1992, Kara decided to trade up from his modest $136,000 home to something much more fitting of a vending-machine millionaire.</p>



<p>His mountain of coins financed the building of a $ 1 million house in an exclusive area of Edmonton with five bedrooms, five bathrooms, an indoor jacuzzi, a steam room, an indoor fountain and a garage for four cars with a built-in car wash.</p>



<p>If asked about the source of his funds, Kara claimed to have sold properties in England and made various claims to be employed in investment banking or owning a computer repair business.&nbsp;</p>



<div>
<p><strong>Salim Karaâs Coin Scam in numbers</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>$2,327,890 </strong>â total amount stolen&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>13 years</strong> â how long he maintained the salami-slicing scam</li>



<li><strong>37 tonnes</strong> â estimated total weight of stolen coins</li>



<li><strong>2 million </strong>â the number of passenger fares Karaâs crime equated to</li>



<li><strong>150km</strong> â the approximate length of Karaâs haul laid end-to-end; six times the length of the entire Edmonton LTR network</li>



<li><strong>$2,959</strong> â the average amount stolen per week</li>
</ul>
</div>



<h2><strong>All good things come to an end</strong></h2>



<p>Kara was effectively stealing 20% of LRT fares over the 13-year period; one in five coins that were fed into the machines by the paying public ended up in his shaving bag, amounting to around 2 million customer journeys. It seems inconceivable that he wasnât caught sooner.</p>



<p>The failure to catch him, despite discrepancies between fares and cash raised in two audits, was put down to a belief that the errors were software glitches and, after his arrest, led to a significant amount of internal finger-pointing.</p>



<p>There were suspicions and even video-taped evidence of Kara acting very strangely a year before he was finally caught, but inadequate processes for whistleblowing meant that it took another year for the alarm to be finally raised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 1993, with the red flags mounting up, the city authorities hired private investigators to observe Kara, which finally caught him in the act. In March 1994, he sliced off the final piece of this very lucrative salami.</p>



<div>
<div>
<p>Two years later, aged 44, Kara was sentenced to four years in jail. Given the unique nature of his crime, the trial attracted plenty of public attention packing out the courthouse, but Karaâs infamy spread further when his attempts to avoid attention outside the courts backfired. </p>



<p>He was rumbled dressing up in disguise worthy of Inspector Clouseau â complete with dark glasses, woolly beanie and trenchcoat â which only heightened interest in him.</p>

</div>



<p>âThere are about 600,000 people living in the city. You have stolen from every citizen, man, woman and child approximately $4 each.â Associate Chief Justice, A.H. Wachowich commented ahead of passing down the sentence.</p>



<p>As Kara repaid the proceeds of his scam to cover the cityâs insurers, he was released after 16 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given the fascinating nature of the crime, the length of time it was maintained and the lifestyle it financed, there were rumours of a book deal, but to date, that hasnât materialised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before his sentencing in March 1996, Kara made an enigmatic statement in court, promising at some point to share his side of this fascinating tale â<em>Remember, every coin has two sides</em>â</p>
