  <blockquote>
  <p>know thyself</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a new lifestyle imposed on almost the entire world, willingly or unwillingly, perhaps by powerful people or by many small people that want to be powerful, which somehow affects all ordinary people: a consumption-oriented life. Fast consumption, constant consumption, more consumption.</p>

<p>I don’t have much to say about the “shopping” side of this consumption craze because it’s a topic that’s been around for many years, born out of  <em>-ism</em> movements and studied numerous times through  <em>-ology</em> disciplines. It has been the subject of public service announcements, romantic comedies, and personal development books. The public has been constantly educated about it for years. Two guys known as The Minimalists and some “smart” people like Marie Kondo made a fortune out of this movement. Personally, I believe I am a conscious consumer, and the shopping craze doesn’t affect me much, so I want to look at the other, often-discussed side of the issue.</p>

<p>The consumption I will discuss is digital content, information, and emotion/thought consumption. I know there are social science studies that delve into the intersections and background connections of all these consumptions, but as an ordinary person, I want to talk about the effects on my own life, particularly my professional development.</p>

<p>Although it has been on my mind for a long time, I haven’t been able to read a comprehensive book based on these studies (<em>the reason being the vicious cycle based on this topic</em>), but I have consumed plenty of content… I’ve watched various TED talks, several indie YouTuber videos with a wholesome background, selling personal development under the hood on their newly launched channels, and of course, read tweets… I’ve also had plenty of opportunities to observe myself.</p>

<p>At this point I am convinced that fast consumption is harmful to the brain, mind, and soul.</p>

<p>The main reason I pursue this topic is that, aside from all the side effects in personal life, it also prevents me from being better at my profession as a brain-worker as Jules Payot puts it.</p>

<p>In disciplines like software engineering, constantly improving oneself and being in a state of continuous learning is an inevitable process. Even if you don’t put in extra effort and just try to do your job, you have to learn a new concept or technology. If you do put in the extra effort, you become someone who does their job better. Since graduating from undergraduate studies <em>(which marks exactly one year as I write this post)</em>, putting in extra effort has been my top priority. Working more, reading more, knowing more. In addition to technical studies, I also read about and received advice on soft skills related to “software crafting.” One of my first mistakes, I think, was taking every kind of advice from everyone. Even if I didn’t implement them directly, these pieces of advice took up space in my mind, and thinking “what if that’s better” prevented me from putting any of them into practice.</p>

<p>The problem with online advice is that the person writing the blog post is doing so entirely from their own perspective and lifestyle. They have no idea about you, and you have no idea about them. There’s no guarantee that what works for them will work for you. Moreover, you don’t get a chance to question causality, you just read the advice, consume it, and move on. It takes up space in your mind and on your to-do list, but you don’t get a chance to internalize or filter this topic. You don’t even realize that you should actually do so.</p>

<p>One of the pieces of advice I took without realizing it was to systematize the mentioned studies, work regularly, and similar. Once that idea put in my mind, things became complicated for me. While working full-time, I had to balance my personal life and stick to the plan.</p>

<p>No matter how much your willpower sticks to the plan, your health, developments in your life, and your brain, which sometimes refuses to accept more information, don’t always stick to the plan. When this happens, it becomes difficult to establish the system I mentioned, and you start looking for more advice, reading more blogs. <strong>You find yourself in a quest for productivity, feeling productive because of the quest, but not really doing any productive work.</strong></p>

<p>Advice also has the effect of reducing creativity and problem-solving skills. When I have a problem, technical or other, the first thing I do is research the solution. As a result, I don’t get enough chance to think about my problem, let alone produce a solution, and I don’t fully understand the problem.</p>

<p>I’ve “consumed” what I should do and how I should do it many times from different people. With all this information occupying my brain, I no longer had the energy and resources to produce a tangible output.</p>

<hr>

<p>Because of my profession, I like learning different concepts from different fields. I am particularly curious about the low-level infrastructures and systems behind high-level tools, and I am aware of the contribution of knowing these to doing my job well. However, because of the constant rush and haste imposed by social media in my life, I can’t devote enough time to these resources. Because I am so used to seeing information, quickly taking it in, and moving on to another topic. Because the short content I constantly consume, whether written or visual, has made me accustomed to this. <br>
While reading a technically deep book, re-reading the same page feels like a waste of time; every piece of information I have to go over because I couldn’t understand it at once makes me feel inadequate and late because I can’t just scroll past it.</p>

<p>I want to know everything, immediately, quickly. Since this is not humanly possible, I end up doing nothing.</p>

<p>I can’t think long-term; I can’t stop myself from thinking that working on a book for 6 months, doing its projects, is a huge waste of time for me, and because I already feel late, I find myself, yet again, in a cycle.</p>

<hr>

<p>When I’m focused solely on consuming, my ability to produce naturally decreases. I include speaking, being able to express oneself, and having a good command of words in this context. After knowing myself as someone who has always been good with words for years, seeing that I can’t choose the right word when speaking, or that I can’t convey the message or information I want to give more clearly and simply when writing, naturally bothers me. Although it is said that software development is an antisocial job, you constantly need to communicate with people, either in writing or verbally, and you need to express what you have done and what you will do well. I am approaching the point of losing this skill by consuming instead of producing.</p>

<hr>

<p>While all this disrupts progress and confuses my mind, I also have to deal with the physical and mental side effects of fast consumption. Difficulty concentrating, lack of focus, inability to understand what I read, stress, anxiety. I see these kinds of complaints from many people lately, and in my opinion, our biggest common ground is digital content consumption.</p>

<p>The relativity of time is a reality I feel to the core while doom scrolling. Besides the lost time, there’s the confusion after realizing it and putting the phone down, trying to get my dazed mind back to normal. And then, not finding anything to do, not being able to putting yourself together, and reaching for the phone again.</p>

<p>Everyone has seen the articles about the brain’s approach to social media content, which offers a quick, easily accessible way that makes you happy or, even if it doesn’t make you happy, offers an escape from the thing that makes you unhappy.</p>

<p>When you put these into words or write them down, it bothers you a lot, but I think knowing yourself is the most important thing to do before changing yourself. I know what I’m doing wrong, and now it’s documented in front of me. I also know what I need to work on.</p>



<p>We are talking about the harms, but I have always been fascinated by the opportunities the internet offers. Being able to communicate and chat with someone from anywhere in the world within seconds is an invaluable blessing. It just takes a little effort to filter to see and reach the right people’s content. Otherwise, I don’t think completely withdrawing would be very beneficial in my industry and the era I live in.</p>

<hr>

<p>I won’t go against what I mentioned so I won’t end this problem-filled post with advice or plans. That’s why I started with the quote “know thyself.” I just tried to see and make the problem tangible. I will stop researching what I can do for a while. First, I plan to clear my mind of clutter, quit this fast and excessive consumption habit I have acquired without realizing it, and then learn how to consume slowly and gradually. I have enough raw information to discover how to do all this myself; I will now give myself the opportunity to process it.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.cognition.ai/blog/devin-generally-available">https://www.cognition.ai/blog/devin-generally-available</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42378994">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> 
<p><img src="https://www.cognition.ai/_astro/generally-available.CHJ0T34J_Z1rnVDi.webp" alt="Devin is generally available" width="1600" height="900" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p> Today we’re making Devin generally available starting at $500 a month for engineering teams, which includes: </p>
<ul>
<li>No seat limits</li>
<li>Access to Devin’s Slack integration, IDE extension, and <a href="https://www.cognition.ai/blog/dec-24-product-update#for-repetitive-engineering-tasks-try-the-devin-api-with-structured-inputoutput">API</a></li>
<li>Onboarding session &amp; support from the Cognition engineering team</li>
</ul>
<p> All engineering teams can now start working with Devin at <a href="https://app.devin.ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">app.devin.ai</a>. </p>
<h2>  </h2> 
<p> While Devin can be an all-purpose tool, we recommend starting with: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Small frontend bugs and edge cases</strong> - tag Devin in Slack threads</li>
<li><strong>Creating first-draft PRs for backlog tasks</strong> - assign Devin tasks from your todo list at the start of your day</li>
<li><strong>Making targeted code refactors</strong> - use the Devin IDE extension (for VSCode and forks) to point Devin to parts of the code you want edited or upgraded</li>
</ul>
<p> Devin has helped teams with everything from building integrations to migrating and maintaining documentation. Devin is versatile, but works best when you: </p>
<ul>
<li>Give Devin tasks that you know how to do yourself</li>
<li>Tell Devin how to test or check its own work</li>
<li>Keep sessions under ~3 hours and break down large tasks</li>
<li>Share detailed requirements upfront</li>
<li>Invest in coaching Devin by providing feedback in chat and accepting suggested <a href="https://docs.devin.ai/Onboard_Devin/knowledge">Knowledge</a>, or adding your own Knowledge manually</li>
</ul>
<h2>  </h2> 
<p> Slack is the primary interface for spinning up Devin sessions, so you can quickly tag @devin to offload smaller tasks and fix bugs when they’re reported. </p>
<p> Try asking Devin to do the first pass on the next 3rd party integration, refactor, or codebase question you have. Devin messages you when it’s done, so you can review Devin’s PR whenever convenient. Devin responds automatically to your Github PR comments. </p>
<lite-youtube videoid="xTbpGq09g88"> <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xTbpGq09g88"> <span></span> </a> </lite-youtube>  

<p> Hand off async work to Devin directly from your IDE with ⌘ G. The Devin extension (Beta Feature available for VScode and forks) allows you to checkout Devin’s PRs and review and accept Devin’s code directly in your IDE. </p>

<h2>  </h2> 
<p> To showcase Devin in action, we’re sharing sessions where Devin resolves issues on a few of our favorite open-source repositories. Devin often needs guidance but we share these examples to show how we use Devin to speed our own workflows. </p>
<p> <em><strong>Anthropic MCP</strong></em> </p>
<p> In this session, Devin identifies the cause of a user-reported issue. We liked how it read the MCP spec in the browser to understand “capability negotiation” and tested its changes end-to-end in the browser. The changes weren’t perfect, so the maintainers gave some feedback on the PR which we addressed with a second Devin session. </p>
<p> First session: <a href="https://app.devin.ai/sessions/266955553baf40cfa7fdd32d42ab219d">https://app.devin.ai/sessions/266955553baf40cfa7fdd32d42ab219d</a> </p>

<p> <em><strong>Zod</strong></em> </p>
<p> This PR adds a new feature to the popular library Zod. Devin planned collaboratively with the user, implemented the feature across multiple files and wrote tests – we were very impressed! There was a merge conflict which we manually resolved because Devin tends to struggle with that. </p>

<p> <em><strong>Google</strong></em> </p>
<p> A user of the Go Github client wished it propagated response objects even on HTTP errors. These small chores are annoying for human engineers because testing is often more effort than the fix itself. Devin required a few iterations to get it right and we manually cleaned up a few stray edits using the VS Code extension. The biggest timesaver here was Devin writing and running the unit tests. </p>

<p> <em><strong>Llama Index</strong></em> </p>
<p> Devin fixes a bug where the implementation of the Anthropic tokenizer followed the protocol incorrectly. It found the correct fix first try and wrote a unit test too. A PR comment from the maintainer requested a small stylistic change which we fixed manually. </p>

<p> <em><strong>Karpathy’s nanoGPT</strong></em> </p>
<p> This change is just a one-liner. But we wouldn’t trust this change without testing – which Devin did nicely by writing an ad-hoc testing script. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://turso.tech/blog/introducing-limbo-a-complete-rewrite-of-sqlite-in-rust">https://turso.tech/blog/introducing-limbo-a-complete-rewrite-of-sqlite-in-rust</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42378843">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2 years ago, we forked SQLite. We were huge fans of the embedded nature of SQLite, but longed for a more open model of development. <a href="https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql">libSQL</a> was born as an Open Contribution project, and we invited the community to build it with us.</p>
<p>As a result, libSQL is an astounding success. With over 12k Github stars, 85 contributors, and features like native replication and vector search, libSQL is the engine that powers the <a href="https://turso.tech/">Turso</a> platform.</p>
<p>Today we are announcing a more ambitious experiment: what could we achieve, if we were to completely <em>rewrite</em> SQLite in a memory-safe language (Rust)? With the Limbo project, now available at <a href="https://github.com/tursodatabase/limbo">github.com/tursodatabase/limbo</a>, we are now trying to answer that question.</p>
<h2 id="the-pros-and-cons-of-forking"><a href="#the-pros-and-cons-of-forking">#</a>The pros and cons of forking</h2>
<p>When we forked SQLite, forking was not the only alternative. We considered rewriting it entirely, but were concerned about the huge lead time needed to have something production-ready, and the toil involved in keeping compatibility. A fork would also allow us to keep back-merging from SQLite, adopting new features as they come.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are disadvantages as well: SQLite’s test suite is proprietary, meaning that it is hard to achieve the confidence to make very large changes. It is also written in C, an unsafe language, which makes evolving the codebase with confidence even harder.</p>
<p>Weighing the pros and cons, forking was the way to go, and the libSQL project was born.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-approach"><a href="#a-new-approach">#</a>A new approach</h2>
<p>Adding Vector search to SQLite was an eye opener. We didn’t want to do this as an extension, since we wanted to make the syntax as straightforward and natural as possible. That would require changes to the bytecode generation, which we did. We are able to expose vectors as a data type, query relational and vector data together in the same table, and as long as the query doesn’t need an index, use perfectly boring SQL syntax.</p>
<p>But for searches with an index, without making very invasive changes, it was hard to achieve the syntax that we wanted:</p>
<pre><code><span>SELECT</span> title, <span>year</span>
   <span>FROM</span> movies
   <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> vector_distance_cos(embedding, vector(<span>'[4,5,6]'</span>))
   LIMIT <span>3</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>And we ended up settling for</p>
<pre><code><span>SELECT</span> title, <span>year</span>
   <span>FROM</span> vector_top_k(<span>'movies_idx'</span>, vector(<span>'[4,5,6]'</span>), <span>3</span>)
   <span>JOIN</span> movies
   <span>ON</span> movies.rowid <span>=</span> id;
</code></pre>
<p>The index is represented as a separate table, and we have to explicitly join it with the main table.</p>
<p>At that point, we decided to try a new approach and answer the question: how much effort was it <em>really</em> involved in rewriting SQLite from scratch ? And can we do it in a way that effortlessly keeps compatibility? Would that make it easier for us to be more aggressive and do some of the things we wanted to do in our fork (like asynchronous I/O) with a high degree of confidence?</p>
<p>To answer those questions, Pekka started an ambitious experiment on hist <a href="https://github.com/penberg/limbo">personal github account</a>. It was named Limbo as a codename temporarily, and it did extremely well. Without much press, just me talking about it on 𝕏, the project grew to 1,000 github stars, and attracted more than 30 contributors organically.</p>
<h2 id="the-next-step"><a href="#the-next-step">#</a>The next step</h2>
<p>With the success of this experiment, we have decided to turn Limbo into an official project at Turso. It is still an experiment, but now an official Turso experiment, which will allow us to pour more resources into it, including more time from other engineers in the company.</p>
<p>Our goal is to build a reimplementation of SQLite from scratch, fully compatible at the language and file format level,  with the same or higher reliability SQLite is known for, but with full memory safety and on a new, modern architecture.</p>
<p>That is not to say that we’re building a competitor or alternative to libSQL: if it succeeds, this codebase just becomes libSQL. The code is available under the same license as libSQL (MIT), and with the same community-friendly attitude that defined our project.</p>
<h2 id="can-we-match-sqlite-s-world-famous-reliability-"><a href="#can-we-match-sqlite-s-world-famous-reliability-">#</a>Can we match SQLite’s world-famous reliability?</h2>
<p>Since this is a reimplementation, doesn’t that mean that testing is now even harder? The reality is that it is the other way around. Since we are reimplementing it from scratch, we are doing it with Deterministic Simulation Testing (DST) built-in from the get-go. We have both added DST facilities to the core of the database, and partnered with Antithesis to achieve a level of reliability in the database that lives up to SQLite’s reputation.</p>
<p>Deterministic Simulation Testing is a paradigm made famous by the folks at <a href="https://tigerbeetle.com/">TigerBeetle</a>, that we at Turso already dipped our toes into with our <a href="https://turso.tech/blog/a-deep-look-into-our-new-massive-multitenant-architecture">server-side code</a>. With DST, we believe we can achieve an even higher degree of robustness than SQLite, since it is easier to simulate unlikely scenarios in a simulator, test years of execution with different event orderings, and upon finding issues, reproduce them 100% reliably.</p>
<p>In the DST world, writing our own simulator is akin to writing unit tests: they allow us to move fast, experiment easily, and stress changes thoroughly. But much as unit testing does not do away with the need for higher level integration testing that tests the behavior of the system at a higher level, we felt like we needed to go the extra mile to achieve the levels of reliability that we wanted.</p>
<p>To complete the puzzle, we wanted to deterministically test the behavior of the database when interacting with the operating system and other components. To do that, we are partnering with <a href="https://antithesis.com/">Antithesis</a>, a company that provides a system-level Deterministic Simulation Testing framework, and can simulate all sorts of hardware and software failures. Antithesis does that by providing a deterministic hypervisor that runs many fuzzing threads in parallel, allowing us to quickly search the input space.</p>
<p>As an example of why this is important, they have already helped us find issues in our <code>io_uring</code> implementation under partial writes. Our own DST framework would not have caught this, since the actual I/O loop is replaced by the simulated I/O loop in testing. Partial writes are an extremely rare condition, and therefore, hard to test in an automated fashion.</p>
<p>Aside from Deterministic simulation testing, we also routinely fuzz inputs, and then make sure that the generated bytecode is the same, for both Limbo and SQLite.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-status"><a href="#the-current-status">#</a>The current status</h2>
<p>While Limbo is still in early stages, it has already achieved some important milestones that are already a couple of things worth noting:</p>
<h3 id="fully-asynchronous-i-o"><a href="#fully-asynchronous-i-o">#</a>Fully asynchronous I/O</h3>
<p>Limbo is designed to be fully asynchronous. SQLite itself has a synchronous interface, meaning driver authors who want asynchronous behavior need to have the extra complication of using helper threads. Because SQLite queries <em>tend</em> to be fast, since no network round trips are involved, a lot of those drivers just settle for a synchronous interface. However, this has two fundamental problems:
Not all SQLite queries are fast. Aggregations over large data, for example, will always be slow, even if the data is fully local.
In modern environments, it is actually desirable that queries go over the network. One example is Turso, which serves SQLite over HTTP. Another example are implementations of SQLite over S3 providing the illusion of infinite storage space, where data <em>can</em> be cached locally, but parts of it may be remote.</p>
<p>Limbo is designed to be asynchronous from the ground up. It extends <code>sqlite3_step</code>, the main entry point API to SQLite, to be asynchronous, allowing it to return to the caller if data is not ready to consume immediately. On Linux, Limbo uses <code>io_uring</code>, a performant API for asynchronous system calls.</p>
<h3 id="designed-for-wasm"><a href="#designed-for-wasm">#</a>Designed for WASM</h3>
<p>While SQLite can compile to WASM, it is mostly an afterthought for SQLite. In practice, projects like wa-sqlite exist to extend SQLite and allow it to function in WASM environments like <a href="https://stackblitz.com/">Stackblitz</a> . Limbo is designed from the ground up to have a WASM build, and already has a VFS implementation that works with popular tools like Drizzle without any changes. For example, it is possible to write:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> { drizzle } <span>from</span> <span>'drizzle-orm/better-sqlite3'</span>;
<span>import</span> * <span>as</span> s <span>from</span> <span>'drizzle-orm/sqlite-core'</span>;
<span>import</span> { <span>Database</span> } <span>from</span> <span>'limbo-wasm'</span>;

<span>const</span> sqlite = <span>new</span> <span>Database</span>(<span>'sqlite.db'</span>);
<span>const</span> db = <span>drizzle</span>({ <span>client</span>: sqlite });
<span>const</span> users = s.<span>sqliteTable</span>(<span>"users"</span>, {
  <span>id</span>: s.<span>integer</span>(),
  <span>name</span>: s.<span>text</span>(),
})

<span>const</span> result = db.<span>select</span>().<span>from</span>(users).<span>all</span>();

<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(result);
</code></pre>
<p>Browser support is in the works.</p>
<h3 id="performance"><a href="#performance">#</a>Performance</h3>
<p>SQLite is known for its stellar performance, but in many operations, Limbo is already on par or faster than SQLite. Executing <code>cargo bench</code> on Limbo’s main directory, we can compare SQLite running <code>SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 1</code> (620ns on my Macbook Air M2), with Limbo executing the same query (506ns), which is 20% faster.</p>
<h3 id="simplicity"><a href="#simplicity">#</a>Simplicity</h3>
<p>Despite the fact that SQLite’s file-based nature makes working with it extremely simple, SQLite grew a considerable amount of tunables over the years, which make getting top performance out of it non-obvious (the SQLite numbers on the benchmark above are after tuning). For maximum performance, users have to choose WAL mode over journal mode, disable POSIX advisory locks, etc.</p>
<p>Limbo, while maintaining compatibility with SQLite’s bytecode and file format, drops a lot of the features that we consider less important for modern environments (including SQLite’s “amalgamation”, the build system that generates a single C file), providing a better out-of-the-box experience.</p>
<h2 id="interested-in-learning-more-"><a href="#interested-in-learning-more-">#</a>Interested in learning more?</h2>
<p>Limbo is available under the MIT license <a href="https://github.com/tursodatabase/limbo">on our Github</a>. If you are interested in building an embedded database with the bold vision of taking the promise of SQLite to the next level, come build with us.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Almost as soon as it closed, a website for the Tidings reemerged, boasting a team of eight reporters, Minihane included, who cranked out densely reported stories every few days. </p><p>And those reporters were covering a lot more than local news. They dove into Oregon’s fentanyl crisis (“Measure 110 might be in for a repeal”), homelessness in Eugene (“All In Lane County homeless program delivers impressive results”), and the food scene in Portland (“The fourth best burger in the U.S. is in Portland”) — essentially any issue that might draw attention from Oregonians. </p><p>The reality was that none of the people allegedly working for the Ashland Daily Tidings existed, or at least were who they claimed to be. The bylines listed on Daily Tidings articles were put there by scammers using artificial intelligence, and in some cases stolen identities, to dupe local readers. </p><p>“It seems quite terrifying,” said Minihane, an actual journalist and author who learned he had his identity stolen after OPB contacted him. “I have friends who live in Portland, but I’ve never been to another part of the state, so I just don’t know quite how it came to pass.”</p><figure><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/TPGUMSNJ45A2RHT7GNXZIJY3T4.jpg?auth=8891639b8e9c97f24c4084501b171f7792505289ceb7eb74e2b06e7443ab702b&amp;width=150" alt="The Ashland Daily Tidings ceased operations in 2023, but a website with the company name still continues publishing online, as seen Nov. 8, 2024."></picture><figcaption><p>The Ashland Daily Tidings ceased operations in 2023, but a website with the company name still continues publishing online, as seen Nov. 8, 2024.</p><p><em>Kristyna Wentz-Graff / OPB</em></p></figcaption></figure><p>The mysterious takeover of a more than 140-year-old news outlet offers a warning of how local news is at risk of disappearing in Oregon’s rural communities, and what an online future supercharged by the next unregulated wave of technology from Silicon Valley companies may hold for news consumers. </p><h2>From the ashes, more ashes</h2><p>The number of people working in journalism in Jackson County, like the entire country, has been precipitously declining since adoption of the internet began to grow in the early 2000s. Most analyses of this era point to the rise of consumer-focused tools like Craigslist, which took a <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/03/craigslist-saved-consumers-a-lot-of-money-while-crippling-newspapers"><u>roughly $5 billion bite out of local news</u></a> through the loss of classified ads, as the start of a long slide in the news business. Fact-based news reporting, which takes time, also has <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/03/31/out-of-print"><u>failed to keep up with online demands</u></a> for the latest content available at the touch of a device. Readers and the advertising dollars that follow them have flocked to social media and other online platforms. </p><p>Jackson County’s current phase of local media, including the ongoing, bizarre operation of the Ashland Daily Tidings, could be seen as beginning in 2017. That’s when Rosebud Media and its owner — an entrepreneur with technology, broadcast and advertising experience — <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2023/01/mail-tribune-owners-push-to-reshape-local-news-cost-medford-its-daily-newspaper.html"><u>plucked the Mail Tribune and the Daily Tidings</u></a> from the grip of the hedge fund-backed GateHouse Media, which later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/business/media/gannett-gatehouse-merger.html" rel="" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/business/media/gannett-gatehouse-merger.html">merged with another powerhouse publisher</a>, Gannett. </p><p>The move offered some hope that Rosebud Media’s vision would preserve what remained of the local journalism that had been pared back by large companies focused primarily on profits. </p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/12/09/local-news-job-loss-oregon/">The state of Oregon's local media in 4 charts</a></p><p>The hope didn’t last. In January 2023, after several initiatives meant to stabilize the papers, Rosebud Media <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2023/01/mail-tribune-storied-newspaper-in-medford-to-abruptly-shut-down.html"><u>closed down </u></a>both for good. The move meant an unceremonious end to Oregon’s first Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper, the Mail Tribune, which earned the award in 1934 for public service by condemning local politicians who supported racial grievances of the Ku Klux Klan and the violent takeover of local government coming out of the Great Depression. </p><p>The East Oregonian Media Group — a family-owned newspaper chain across rural parts of Oregon and Southwest Washington — stepped in after Rosebud’s closure, and earned heaps of praise when it announced plans to open a local newspaper that would replace the Mail Tribune. </p><figure><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/YCFFR7JUQBGBLBA67TOGSA4VN4.jpg?auth=ae6d70e658a5a8c372127b4a91da37ff8f8582e5059f7729e22756c2bdd41a48&amp;width=150" alt="The Ashland Tidings, Dec. 23, 1912, part of the Library of Congress Chronicling America online collection."></picture><figcaption><p>The Ashland Tidings, Dec. 23, 1912, part of the Library of Congress Chronicling America online collection.</p><p><em>Courtesy of Library of Congress</em></p></figcaption></figure><p>That hope didn’t last either. In late October, EO Media Group announced it was <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/10/23/east-oregon-bulletin-bend-eo-media-group/"><u>selling its roughly dozen newspapers</u></a>, including the Rogue Valley Times in Medford, to Carpenter Media Group. The Mississippi-based company — now the fourth-largest newspaper owner in the country — had been on a Northwest newspaper buying spree and boasted of its commitment to “<a href="https://www.nna.org/carpenter-media-group-to-acquire-eo-media-group#:~:text=PENDLETON%2C%20Oregon%20%E2%80%93%20Carpenter%20Media%20Group,roots%20in%20the%20Pacific%20Northwest."><u>high quality, community focused journalism</u></a>” before laying off an untold number of reporters and editors in the <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2024/07/new-owner-of-portland-tribune-other-oregon-newspapers-lays-off-some-staff.html"><u>Portland suburbs</u></a>, Central Oregon, Eastern Oregon, Southern Oregon and <a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/news/everett-herald-newsroom-strikes-amid-layoffs/"><u>Everett, Washington</u></a>. </p><p>This cycle of a new owner buying a local newspaper every few years — only for more journalists to lose their jobs shortly after the sale — is not unique to Jackson County. Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism, which tracks media outlet sales and layoffs in an annual report, estimates the year from 2022 to 2023 saw a rapid loss of 7,000 newspaper-related jobs across the country compared to just a few hundred the year before. According to Medill’s data, nearly every county east of the Cascades in Oregon has <a href="https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/projects/state-of-local-news/explore/#/state-localnewslandscape?state=OR&amp;stateCode=41"><u>two or fewer local news sources</u></a>. Most have a single source, and six counties have no local news outlet at all. </p><p>The result of all these consolidations and job losses is less information being reported locally for Oregonians, particularly those in rural communities who are seeing papers close at troubling rates, according to Medill’s mapping of news deserts. </p><h2>Plagiarism, by any other name</h2><p>The mysterious emergence of AI invaders on the local news scene is a new development in Oregon, and the Ashland Daily Tidings website appears designed to hide its true operators.</p><p>After Rosebud Media closed in 2023, the Daily Tidings website emerged again with a claimed staff of eight contributors, none of whom are reporters working in Southern Oregon. Two of the writers have sparse social media presences that suggest they live in South Africa. Neither responded to a request for comment from OPB, though one did share a social media post in November praising artificial intelligence. “Try to learn Artificial intelligence and don’t curse in AI. Do your hard work and Update your skills,” they wrote in a LinkedIn post. </p><p>Two of the writers on the Daily Tidings website are actually correspondents for the London-based Daily Mail. Another two have actually worked as journalists in Southern Oregon. One supposed writer has no online presence as a journalist outside the Daily Tidings website.</p><figure><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/OA7IBK6IR5D2HNGZHI5KKXBAFM.jpg?auth=b30b3a1c583fc5a1a115f9515fa0ab3d9578a0bca4de00e7e2cd32c373290508&amp;width=150" alt="An Oct. 25, 2024, screenshot of the Ashland Daily Tidings' contributor page.

During OPB's reporting on the use of artificial intelligence by the website's operators, many of these contributors were removed from the page.</p><p><em>Ryan Haas / OPB</em></p></figcaption></figure><p>OPB used various methods to track down all of the listed reporters on the Southern Oregon webpage, including searching social media and contacting former employers. After OPB began reaching out to people credited on the Tidings’ stories, more than half the staff disappeared from the page and their bylines were replaced on existing stories. Three journalists who responded to OPB’s requests for comment said they had no idea their names or images were being used to produce stories for the Daily Tidings. </p><p>“Plagiarism, I think it’s called,” quipped Bert Etling, the former editor of the Daily Tidings who now runs the digital nonprofit media outlet <a href="https://ashland.news/" title="https://ashland.news/"><u>Ashland.news</u></a>. </p><p>Etling, who started his local journalism career in 1982 and was laid off in 2019 by Rosebud Media, noticed the revived Daily Tidings soon after it emerged because his own reporters saw work remarkably similar to their own appearing on the webpage. The stories would have fresh headlines and the writing would be tweaked, but the reporting and quotes from sources would closely match work Ashland.news had previously published. OPB staff members have also <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/10/03/josephine-county-jail-wellpath/"><u>had their work</u></a> taken and <a href="https://www.dailytidings.com/court-finds-oregon-healthcare-provider-destroyed-evidence/"><u>republished on the Daily Tidings</u></a> website with marginally changed sentences. </p><p>“They just put it in a blender and then pour it out on their page,” Etling said. “It’s maddening.”</p><figure><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/6NX5HUYVR5FJROAZ24DYGEKZJQ.jpg?auth=c375a0f6c300e10f18ba0cacfb8ed320b531482f5adf249add13eb5385e96a32&amp;width=150" alt="Ashland News Executive Editor Bert Etling at an announcement for the launch of the news site."></picture><figcaption><p>Ashland News Executive Editor Bert Etling at an announcement Dec. 17, 2021, for the launch of the news site.</p><p><em>Erik Neumann  / JPR News</em></p></figcaption></figure><p>Since artificial intelligence’s wider adoption by the public in the past two years, journalism has been a regular target for scams that further threaten the business of producing news. A New York-based journalist collective, 404 Media, was <a href="https://www.404media.co/why-404-media-needs-your-email-address/"><u>among the first to notice a trend of fraudulent websites</u></a> taking real stories and using AI “spinners” to rewrite the articles with the goal of grabbing web traffic. Other reporting revealed a Serbian DJ who <a href="https://racketmn.com/southwest-journal-minneapolis-mn-vujo-ai"><u>pretended to operate a news outlet in a Minneapolis suburb</u></a>, only to leave local readers confused when they’d click stories to find AI-generated content that had nothing to do with Minnesota.</p><p>The Daily Tidings appears to be the first time an Oregon news outlet has stolen the identities of real journalists to trick local readers with AI-generated content. The goal is apparently to deceive Oregonians into giving clicks — and the resulting ad revenue — to whoever is behind the website. </p><h2>The source</h2><p>The Daily Tidings wasn’t the first time Joe Minihane had his work, or his identity, ripped off using AI. </p><p>In March, someone took over the webpage domain for Minihane’s personal website after he didn’t pay to renew his ownership. Whoever grabbed the site filled it with mundane prose that vaunted Minihane’s ability as a journalist — and his ability to write essays. The purpose for the website takeover appears in links subtly embedded throughout, which offer to sell high school students essays for their homework. </p><p>“I find it fascinating when the bots write about you in the third person,” he told OPB. “I can’t get to the bottom of these things.”</p><p>A similar type of theft may be behind whatever is happening at the Ashland Daily Tidings. </p><p>The Daily Tidings claims on its website that it was acquired by Difference Media, LLC, in 2021. Difference Media was founded by a father and son in Texas to promote Christian music. Speaking to OPB, a company official said they were not aware of the Daily Tidings and that the company owns no newspapers. </p><p>OPB reached out to the operators of the Daily Tidings through the website’s contact form and listed email for the paper’s news desk, but received no reply. </p><p>The alleged timeline of the Difference Media purchase also does not line up with the Daily Tidings’ prior ownership. </p><p>When owner Steve Saslow closed Rosebud Media in 2023, the web domain for the Ashland Daily Tidings and the Medford Mail Tribune became inactive, creating an opportunity for the fraudulent version to replace it.</p><p>In his first interview since closing the papers, Saslow told OPB he had his attorneys pursue litigation against whomever is behind the AI-written stories for copyright infringement. The lawyers told him the fraudulent acts are coming from outside the United States, likely in China, and they described the legal quest as akin to “pursuing a phantom.”</p><p>“They do this apparently with either existing or defunct newspapers around the world,” Saslow said. “[My lawyers] said you could go and spend all kinds of money, and trying to find them would be a needle in a haystack if we could do it at all.”</p><p>Saslow opted not to spend that money chasing down the fraudsters. There’s little doubt money is the reason behind the fraud, however. </p><p>The Daily Tidings website, despite its reliance on copyright infringement and stolen identities, presents readers with banners and pop-up videos from major advertisement-serving companies on the internet, such as Google, YieldMo and the Trade Desk. Display ads like those on the website can earn the site’s operators a few dollars for each 1,000 appearances the ads make, potentially making the endless churn of stolen stories a lucrative business. It’s unclear exactly how much money the Daily Tidings is generating each year from such ad placements. </p><p>After being alerted to the scam by OPB, Google took action against the Daily Tidings website by removing its ads from specific pages on the website the tech giant viewed as violating its terms of service. </p><p>“We have strict publisher policies that govern the types of content we allow to monetize. Upon reviewing the site in question, we have taken action to demonetize the pages where we identified violations of these policies,” spokesperson Nate Funkhouser said in an email. </p><p>The main landing page of the Daily Tidings continued to serve advertisements from Google and other companies as of Dec. 2. Other advertisement-serving companies that appear to be providing income to the Daily Tidings did not respond to OPB’s requests for comment. </p><h2>The future of local journalism</h2><p>Saslow said he started Rosebud Media because he saw the old models for local journalism had created a business that only seemed to recede as online platforms advanced. From his perspective, local readers would be the big losers if nothing changed.</p><p>“It really was about the true sense of journalism,” he said. “That’s why I named the thing Rosebud. It was a joke from the movie ‘Citizen Kane.’ He thought he could control everything and the answer was no, that’s what you don’t want.”</p><p>A desire to experiment led Saslow to partner with Sinclair Broadcast Group to produce some video content with his former reporters. Saslow hoped the experimentation with print, video and online stories would be an attractive package for advertisers who want the maximum number of eyeballs for their dollars. While that effort didn’t translate to advertisers writing bigger checks, Saslow said he isn’t giving up his goal of finding a formula that makes local journalism financially stable. As early as 2025, he said, he’d like to return to Southern Oregon with a new venture that ties together local and national issues in a way that could be a single stop for readers inundated with information. </p><p>“You’ve got to have this mix of everything that would affect a person’s life,” Saslow said. “There’s going to be a breakthrough where somebody basically is able to evolve news to something that is completely different.”</p><p>The future of local journalism in Oregon likely depends on whether its decadeslong retrenchment continues under the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/01/technology/google-ai-search-publishers.html"><u>growing pressures of Silicon Valley’s push into artificial intelligence</u></a>, or if the remaining media outlets in the state can convince their readers that human-verified information is a necessity. Ashland.news, the digital startup led by Etling, is taking some decidedly old-school approaches to help his publication. Even as his reporters are competing with social media posts from the zombified Daily Tidings, Etling said he is constantly thinking about how he can prove to the people living in the Rogue Valley that local journalism is worth saving. </p><p>“People had it easy with the subsidized newspaper,” he said. “It was subsidized by capitalism-assisted democracy — by selling sofas and mattresses on the pages of your newspaper and making it really cheap to get. That’s gone away, and it’s not coming back.”</p><p>Etling doesn’t know what will replace journalism’s long dead revenue sources of classified advertisements and public notices, but he believes the nonprofit model Ashland.news follows — one built on giving well-reported local stories to a local audience — could hold some clues. </p><p>Rather than chasing profits, the company has tried to offer its readers a simple value proposition: We live here, and we want to tell you stories about this community. </p><p>Ashland.news doesn’t have billions of dollars in venture capital behind it like the largest artificial intelligence companies, but it does have an edge those companies don’t have: people who live in the community they’re covering. This year, the outlet’s staff marched in the Fourth of July parade. The response surprised Etling. </p><p>“People were hollering out, ‘We love Ashland News!’ and ‘Thank you!’” he said. “It was really gratifying.”</p><p>The company also recently sent a print edition — a surprising move for a digital outlet — to 17,000 mailboxes in Ashland and nearby Talent as another way to reach people who may not know their local journalism is at risk of going away. </p><p>Those curated appeals to local readers may be working, too. Etling estimates Ashland.news has around 4,750 newsletter subscribers — more than three times the number of people who subscribed to the Daily Tidings when he was editor. </p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article data-comment-id="144-" id="144-"><span><span><a href="https://antirez.com/user/antirez">antirez</a></span> 51 minutes ago. 15113 views.  </span><pre>I’m not the kind of person that develops a strong attachment to their own work. When I decided to leave Redis, about 1620 days ago (~ 4.44 years), I never looked at the source code, commit messages, or anything related to Redis again. From time to time, when I needed Redis, I just downloaded it and compiled it. I just typed “make” and I was very happy to see that, after many years, building Redis was still so simple.

My detachment was not the result of me hating my past work. While in the long run my creative work was less and less important and the “handling the project” activities became more and more substantial — a shift that many programmers are able to do, but that’s not my bread and butter — well, I still enjoyed doing Redis stuff when I left. However, I don’t share the vision that most people at my age (I’m 47 now) have: that they are still young. I wanted to do new stuff, especially writing. I wanted to stay more with my family and help my relatives. I definitely needed a break.

However, during the “writing years” (I’m still writing, by the way), I often returned to coding, as a way to take breaks from intense writing sessions (writing is the only mental activity I found to be a great deal more taxing than coding): I did a few embedded projects; played more with neural networks; built Telegram bots: a bit of everything. Hacking randomly was cool but, in the long run, my feeling was that I was lacking a real purpose, and every day I started to feel a bigger urgency to be part of the tech world again. At the same time, I saw the Redis community fragmenting, something that was a bit concerning to me, even as an outsider.

So I started to think that maybe, after all, I could have a role back in the Redis ecosystem. Perhaps I could be able to reshape the company's attitude towards the community. Maybe I could even help to take back the role of the Redis core as the primary focus of new developments. Basically I could be some kind of “evangelist” (I don’t love the name of this role, but… well, you get it), that is, on one side, a bridge between the company and the community, but also somebody that could produce programming demos, invent and describe new patterns, write documentation, videos and blog posts about new and old stuff. And, what about the design of new stuff? I could learn from the work of people in the wild, from their difficulties, distill it, and report back design ideas, in order for Redis to evolve.

# Time in NY

At some point my daughter, who is now 12, and is a crucial person in my life, enlightening my days with her intelligence, creativity and love, wanted to visit NYC for her birthday. We decided that yes, this was a good idea after all, we had a couple very difficult years recently, so, why not? My daughter is now more of a girl than a child. So, in NYC, I thought: maybe this is the right time, I can do a part time job. I met the new Redis CEO, Rowan Trollope, very recently, in a video call. I had the feeling that I could work with him to tune the future of the company’s relationships with the community and the codebase direction. So I wrote him an email saying: do you think I could be back in some kind of capacity? Rowan showed interest in my proposal, and quickly we found some agreement.

# About the license switch

People will ask questions about why I *actually* did this, whether there is some back story other than what I just wrote above, if there is some agreement involved, or a big amount of money; something odd or unclear. But sometimes things are very boring: 1. I contacted the company, not the reverse. 2. I’m not getting crazy money to re-enter, it’s not about exploiting some situation — normal salary (but, disclaimer: yes, I have Redis stock options like I had before, no less, no more). 3. I don’t have huge issues with Redis changing its license; Specifically I don’t think the fracture with the community is *really* about this. But since people will ask me about that very important matter, it is better to tell you all the truth immediately.

# The licensing dilemma

I wrote open source software for almost my whole life. Yet, as I’m an atheist and still I’m happy when I see other people believing in God, if this helps them to survive life’s hardships, I also don’t believe that open source is the only way to write software. When I started to develop Redis in the context of a company where I was one of the two founders and where we kept the software code closed (Redis was opened as it was considered not part of the core product). We didn't want our services to be copied by others, as simple as that. So I’m not an extremist in this regard – I’m an extremist only about software design.

Moreover, I don’t believe that openness and licensing are only what the OSI tells us they are. I see licensing as a spectrum of things you can and can’t do. At the same time, I’m truly concerned that big cloud providers have changed the incentives in the system software arena. Redis was not the only project to change license, it was actually the last one… of a big pile. And I have the feeling that in recent years many projects didn’t even start because of a lack of a clear potential business model. So, the Redis license switch was not my decision and perhaps I would have chosen a different license? I’m not sure, it’s too easy to relitigate right now, far from the scene for many years and without business pressures. But in general, I can understand the choice.

Moreover, if you read the new Redis license, sure, it’s not BSD, but basically as long as you don’t sell Redis as a service, you can use it in very similar ways and with similar freedoms as before (what I mean is that you can still modify Redis, redistribute it, use Redis commercially, in your for-profit company, for free, and so forth). You can *even* still sell Redis as a service if you want, as long as you release all the orchestration systems under the same license (something that nobody would likely do, but this shows the copyleft approach of the license). The license language is almost the same as the AGPL, with changes regarding the SAAS stuff. So, not OSI approved? Yes, but I have issues calling the SSPL a closed license.

You will say (I can hear you): the real problem is that there are companies controlling OSS projects’ direction! So eventually the interests get more aligned with companies and less with the user base. I’m grateful there are many projects out there with zero direct companies involvement (if not external sponsorship), but well, you know what? Involvement of companies, in many large projects, actually slows down this process of skewing the right path. This surely happened in the case of Redis.

# The Robin Hood of software

Let's jump back into the past, to the first days of Redis.

When Redis started to become popular, I wanted to find a way to continue working on it. This was before VMware offered me to sponsor my work. I started to play with the idea of a business model, and guess what? It was in the form of closed source products that would kinda help people running Redis, in some way or the other. (Amazingly, one of the repositories associated with this idea is still online, showing commits of *15* years ago: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/antirez/redis-tools">https://github.com/antirez/redis-tools</a>)

I was about to try some kind of open core approach; I also remember I was thinking about delaying the BSD license for new code for six months, in order to create some kind of advantage for paying users. Now I don’t believe I would be a jerk and do strange games with my users, but I would not be what I was able to be thanks to VMware and, later, more extensively thanks to Redis Labs later: a freaking Robin Hood of open source software, where I was well compensated by a company and no, not to do the interests of the company itself, but only to make the best interests of the Redis community. This is a better setup than having your own company, I’m sure about that.

VMWare, and later Redis Labs, didn’t pay just for me. If you give a quick look at the repository contributions history, you’ll see the second all time contributor to be Oran Agra (Redis) then there is Pieter Noordhuis (VMWare) and so forth.

So basically I think that 12 years of BSD code written just focusing on the user base is a good deal, and it’s something to be happy about. And right now for me the most important part is that the fracture with the community is not about licensing, or at least it’s not mainly about licensing. Actually the new license can solve some part of it: now there is no longer an incentive to just leave the core in maintenance mode and put the new developments into modules. With the new license, cloud providers can’t just cut and paste the Redis code base and sell it without any revenue sharing (was this really asking for too much? This could have prevented all the license switches you saw lately, not just Redis). With the new license, the spotlight can be back on the Redis core, with new, exciting features in the hands of the developers around the world. With tens of people well compensated for their work pushing useful, well documented changes in the GitHub repository. This is also one of the things I would like to help the company with, and I’ll try hard. We need to make the license switch having good effects on the user base and features: that’s my idea.

# About AI, LLMs and vector indexing

But there is more: Redis is getting interested in developing vector capabilities, and in general to support the kind of programming you can do with AI. Now, every day, I read Hacker News, and I see a huge amount of technical people who dislike AI and the new developments. I also see a lot of people who don't even care to really try the latest models available in depth (hint: Claude AI is in its own league) and still dismiss them as kinda useless. For me, it’s different. I always loved neural networks. I wrote my first NN library in 2003 and was totally shocked by how powerful and cool the whole concept was. And now, at the end of 2024, I’m finally seeing incredible results in the field, things that looked like sci-fi a few years ago are now possible: Claude AI is my reasoning / editor / coding partner lately. I’m able to accomplish a lot more than I was able to do in the past. I often do *more work* because of AI, but I do better work. Recently I wrote a sci-fi short story for an Italian publisher, and thanks to Claude criticizing parts of it I rewrote the ending and produced a much better work (I didn’t let Claude write a single line of the story or the plot: great use of AI is not making machines do what you can do better).

Yesterday I needed to evaluate how much faster dot product could be computed with 8 bit quantization of my vectors; I told Claude I needed a benchmark designed in a specific way, and two minutes later I could test it, modify it, and understand whether it was worthwhile or not. Basically, AI didn’t replace me, AI accelerated me or improved me with feedback about my work. And I believe that (regardless of the popularity of RAG, which is not necessarily the main application, nor the most future proof or useful, as models contexts are becoming larger and larger, and soon popular models attention may have linear complexity), sorry for the digression, I was saying that I believe that learned embeddings are here to stay, and vector search is something that belongs to Redis for several reasons: first because vector indexes are data structures, particularly slow data structures, and such data structures can work very well in memory. Also, because I think I found the perfect API to expose them.

During my work in designing Redis, I always showed some contradictory tendencies. I was always ready to say “no” to certain things that looked like perfect fits for the project (named Lua scripts, hash fields expires, that are both part of Redis now, btw) but at the same time I added Lua scripting capabilities — when it looked like nuts, an interpreter inside Redis?! —, the Pub/Sub capability, that seemed out of context, then streams, and even synthetic data structures that don’t exist in computer science books, like sorted sets. Because, for me, the fitness of new features into Redis was about two things: use cases and internal design fit. Redis, for me, is lego for programmers, not a “product”.

# Vector sets

So recently I started to think that sorted sets can inspire a new data type, where the score is actually a vector. And while I was in talks with Rowan, I started to write a design document, then I started to implement a proof of concept of the new data structure, reimplementing HNSWs from scratch (instead of using one of the available libraries, since I wanted to tune every little bit), the Redis way, and well, I’m not sure how this will end, I’m still in the early stages of coding, but perhaps I may end up contributing code again, if this proposal gets accepted. The module I implemented (that would be later merged into the core – for now it’s a module just for the sake of simplicity) implements new commands that manipulate embeddings directly. I’ll show you just that as a hint:


VSIM top_1000_movies_imdb ELE "The Matrix"  WITHSCORES
 1) "The Matrix"
 2) "0.9999999403953552"
 3) "Ex Machina"
 4) "0.8680362105369568"
 5) "Akira"
 6) "0.8635441958904266"
 7) "District 9"
 8) "0.8631418347358704"
 9) "The Martian"
10) "0.8608670234680176"
11) "The Bourne Ultimatum"
12) "0.8599717319011688"
13) "The Bourne Supremacy"
14) "0.8591427505016327"
15) "Blade Runner"
16) "0.8585404753684998"
17) "Metropolis"
18) "0.8572960793972015"
19) "Inception"
20) "0.8521313071250916"

So you have VSIM, VADD, VCARD, all the obvious stuff. It’s exactly the idea of sorted sets, but with multi-dimensional scores (embeddings!) and K-NN matches. What do you think? And, of course, on top of that there are many implementation tricks to make stuff more efficient. But for now it’s proof of concept code, let me work a bit more on it. I’m implementing threading, dimensionality reduction, quantization, and many more things. Quite fun, to be honest.

As you can see, there is no mention of hybrid search, the recent buzzword about vector stores. Again, this is the Redis way: to let the developer have a role and decide on their tradeoffs: they know what they are modeling, after all. You have a vector index per key, and like what programmers were able to do with sorted sets, they will invent interesting splitting strategies, new schemas, Lua scripts, patterns and all that is required in order to model their use cases.

Still, while normally the associated item will likely be a small string or a document ID, nothing prevents it from being something more complex, with metadata that can be filtered later (but I’ll resist). I just have the feeling that many use cases don’t really need complex server-side filtering, and can be modeled by pre-partitioning data.

What I see with great interest is the addition of a potential STORE option, to store the result into a sorted set instead of returning it to the user, where the score is the similarity, of course. All this also has complex and interesting effects on efficiency, scalability, ability to use scripting, and so forth: I hope I’ll have the opportunity to talk more about it in the next weeks and months.

Ok, ok: back to the point of this blog post. But perhaps the above is the *real* point, having new ideas that can be exciting.

# So, I’m back 🙂

All this to say that, I’m back. I think it’s the right moment for a big thank you to all the Redis community, for what it has done over the years. See you around, I hope there is something more to add to this journey.

P.S. I’m active on BlueSky, if you want to follow the developments of all this. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://bsky.app/profile/antirez.bsky.social">https://bsky.app/profile/antirez.bsky.social</a></pre></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-8525">
				
<p>Yesterday I arrived in Santa Clara for the <a href="https://q2b.qcware.com/2024-conferences/silicon-valley/">Q2B (Quantum 2 Business) conference</a>, which starts this morning, and where I’ll be speaking Thursday on “Quantum Algorithms in 2024: How Should We Feel?” and also closing the conference via an Ask-Us-Anything session with John Preskill.  (If you’re at Q2B, reader, come and say hi!)</p>



<p>And to coincide with Q2B, yesterday Google’s Quantum group <a href="https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/">officially announced “Willow,”</a> its new 105-qubit superconducting chip with which it’s demonstrated an error-corrected surface code qubit as well as a new, bigger quantum supremacy experiment based on Random Circuit Sampling. I was lucky to be able to attend Google’s announcement ceremony yesterday afternoon at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, where <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=88">friend-of-the-blog-for-decades Dave Bacon</a> and other Google quantum people explained exactly what was done and took questions (the technical level was surprisingly high for this sort of event). I was also lucky to get a personal briefing last week from Google’s Sergio Boixo on what happened.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, yesterday Sundar Pichai <a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1866167429367468422">tweeted about Willow</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1866170803051499874">Elon Musk replied “Wow.”</a>  It cannot be denied that those are both things that happened.</p>



<p>Anyway, all yesterday, I then read comments on Twitter, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42367649">Hacker News</a>, etc. complaining that, since there wasn’t yet a post on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>, how could anyone possibly know what to think of this?? For 20 years I’ve been trying to teach the world how to fish in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space">Hilbert space</a>, but (sigh) I suppose I’ll just hand out some more fish. So, here are my comments:</p>



<ol>
<li>Yes, this is great. Yes, it’s a real milestone for the field. To be clear: for anyone who’s been following experimental quantum computing these past five years (say, since Google’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/opinion/google-quantum-computer-sycamore.html">original quantum supremacy milestone</a> in 2019), there’s no particular shock here. Since 2019, Google has roughly doubled the number of qubits on its chip and, more importantly, increased the qubits’ coherence time by a factor of 5. Meanwhile, their 2-qubit gate fidelity is now roughly 99.7% (for controlled-Z gates) or 99.85% (for “iswap” gates), compared to ~99.5% in 2019. They then did the more impressive demonstrations that predictably become possible with more and better qubits. And yet, even if the progress is broadly in line with what most of us expected, it’s still of course immensely gratifying to see everything actually work! Huge congratulations to everyone on the Google team for a well-deserved success.<br></li>



<li>I <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=8310">already blogged about this!!!</a> Specifically, I blogged about Google’s fault-tolerance milestone when its <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13687">preprint appeared on the arXiv</a> back in August. To clarify, what we’re all talking about now is the same basic technical advance that Google already reported in August, except now with the PR blitz from Sundar Pichai on down, a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08449-y"><em>Nature</em> paper</a>, an official name for the chip (“Willow”), and a bunch of additional details about it.<br></li>



<li>Scientifically, the headline result is that, as they increase the size of their surface code, from 3×3 to 5×5 to 7×7, Google finds that their encoded logical qubit stays alive for <em>longer</em> rather than shorter.  So, this is a very important threshold that’s now been crossed.  As Dave Bacon put it to me, “eddies are now forming”—or, to switch metaphors, after 30 years we’re now finally tickling the tail of the dragon of quantum fault-tolerance, the dragon that (once fully awoken) will let logical qubits be preserved and acted on for basically arbitrary amounts of time, allowing scalable quantum computation.<br></li>



<li>Having said that, Sergio Boixo tells me that Google will only consider itself to have created a “true” fault-tolerant qubit, once it can do fault-tolerant two-qubit gates with an error of ~10<sup>-6</sup> (and thus, on the order of a million fault-tolerant operations before suffering a single error).  We’re still some ways from <em>that</em> milestone: after all, in this experiment Google created only a <em>single</em> encoded qubit, and didn’t even try to do encoded operations on it, let alone on multiple encoded qubits.  But all in good time.  Please don’t ask me to predict how long, though empirically, the time from one major experimental QC milestone to the next now seems to be measured in years, which are longer than weeks but shorter than decades.<br></li>



<li>Google has also announced a new quantum supremacy experiment on its 105-qubit chip, based on <a href="http://Random Circuit Sampling">Random Circuit Sampling</a> with 40 layers of gates.  Notably, they say that, if you use the best currently-known simulation algorithms (based on Johnnie Gray’s optimized tensor network contraction), as well as an exascale supercomputer, their new experiment would take ~300 million years to simulate classically if memory is not an issue, or ~10<sup>25</sup> years if memory <em>is</em> an issue (note that a mere ~10<sup>10</sup> years have elapsed since the Big Bang).  Probably some people have come here expecting me to debunk those numbers, but as far as I know they’re entirely correct, with the caveats stated.  Naturally it’s possible that better classical simulation methods will be discovered, but meanwhile the experiments themselves will also rapidly improve.<br></li>



<li>Having said that, the <em>biggest</em> caveat to the “10<sup>25</sup> years” result is one to which I fear Google drew insufficient attention. Namely, for the exact same reason why (as far as anyone knows) this quantum computation would take ~10<sup>25</sup> years for a classical computer to simulate, <strong>it would also take ~10<sup>25</sup> years for a classical computer to directly verify the quantum computer’s results!!</strong> (For example, by computing the “Linear Cross-Entropy” score of the quantum computer’s outputs.) For this reason, all validation of Google’s new supremacy experiment is indirect, based on extrapolations from smaller circuits, ones for which a classical computer <em>can</em> feasibly check the results. To be clear, I <em>personally</em> see no reason to doubt those extrapolations. But for anyone who wonders why I’ve been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6YPAQlGejo">obsessing for years</a> about the need to design <em>efficiently</em> <em>verifiable</em> near-term quantum supremacy experiments: well, this is why! We’re now deeply into the unverifiable regime that I warned about.<br></li>



<li>In his remarks yesterday, Google Quantum AI leader Hartmut Neven talked about David Deutsch’s argument, way back in the 1990s, that quantum computers should force us to accept the reality of the Everettian multiverse, since “where else could the computation have happened, if it wasn’t being farmed out to parallel universes?” And naturally there was lots of debate about that on Hacker News and so forth. Let me confine myself here to saying that, in my view, the new experiment doesn’t add anything <em>new</em> to this old debate. It’s yet another confirmation of the predictions of quantum mechanics. What those predictions <em>mean</em> for our understanding of reality can continue to argued as it’s been since the 1920s.<br></li>



<li>Cade Metz did a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/technology/google-quantum-computing.html">piece about Google’s announcement</a> for the <em>New York Times</em>.  Alas, when Cade reached out to me for comment, I decided that it would be too awkward, after what Cade <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5310">did to my friend Scott Alexander</a> almost four years ago.  I talked to several other journalists, such as <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/google-passes-milestone-road-error-free-quantum-computer">Adrian Cho for <em>Science</em></a>.<br></li>



<li>No doubt people will ask me what this means for superconducting qubits versus trapped-ion or neutral-atom or photonic qubits, or for Google versus its many competitors in experimental QC. And, I mean, it’s not <em>bad</em> for Google or for superconducting QC! These past couple years I’d sometimes commented that, since Google’s 2019 announcement of quantum supremacy via superconducting qubits, the trapped-ion and neutral-atom approaches had seemed to be pulling ahead, with spectacular results from Quantinuum (trapped-ion) and QuEra (neutral atoms) among others. One could think of Willow as Google’s reply, putting the ball in competitors’ courts likewise to demonstrate better logical qubit lifetime with increasing code size (or, better yet, full operations on logical qubits exceeding that threshold, without resorting to postselection).  The great advantage of trapped-ion qubits continues to be that you can move the qubits around (and also, the two-qubit gate fidelities seem somewhat ahead of superconducting).  But to compensate, superconducting qubits have the advantage that the gates are a thousand times faster, which makes feasible to do experiments that require collecting millions of samples.<br></li>



<li>Of course the <em>big</em> question, the one on everyone’s lips, was always how quantum computing skeptic Gil Kalai was going to respond.  But we need not wonder!  On his blog, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2024/12/09/the-case-against-googles-claims-of-quantum-supremacy-a-very-short-introduction/">Gil writes</a>: “We did not study yet these particular claims by Google Quantum AI but my general conclusion apply to them ‘Google Quantum AI’s claims (including published ones) should be approached with caution, particularly those of an extraordinary nature. These claims may stem from significant methodological errors and, as such, may reflect the researchers’ expectations more than objective scientific reality.’ ”&nbsp; Most of Gil’s post is devoted to re-analyzing data from Google’s 2019 quantum supremacy experiment, which Gil continues to believe can’t possibly have done what was claimed.  Gil’s problem is that the 2019 experiment was long ago superseded anyway: besides the new and more inarguable Google result, IBM, Quantinuum, QuEra, and USTC have now all <em>also</em> reported Random Circuit Sampling experiments with good results.  I predict that Gil, and others who take it as axiomatic that scalable quantum computing is impossible, will continue to have their work cut out for them in this new world.</li>

<p><strong><mark>Update:</mark></strong> <a href="https://x.com/skdh/status/1866352680899104960">Here’s Sabine Hossenfelder’s take.</a>  I don’t think she and I disagree about any of the actual facts; she just decided to frame things much more negatively.  Ironically, I guess 20 years of covering hyped, dishonestly-presented non-milestones in quantum computing has inclined me to be pretty positive when a group puts in this much work, demonstrates a <em>real</em> milestone, and talks about it without obvious falsehoods.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large language models (LLMs) are restricted to reason in the "language space", where they typically express the reasoning process with a chain-of-thought (CoT) to solve a complex reasoning problem. However, we argue that language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, most word tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for reasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge challenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an unrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new paradigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). We utilize the last hidden state of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed "continuous thought"). Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the LLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space. Experiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several reasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent advanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple alternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a single deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical reasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with fewer thinking tokens during inference. These findings demonstrate the promise of latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research.

					<p>A conversation about yogurt wars, German hymns, tropical cyclones, and the people who make Wikipedia function.</p>
				<div>
											<div><p><strong>Asterisk: </strong><em>You're famous for the Depths of Wikipedia account, where you share factoids from some of the most arcane, interesting, and surprising pages on Wikipedia. But you're also now a part of the broader Wikipedia community. How did you first get interested in the site, and how has your involvement changed over time?&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>Annie Rauwerda: </strong>I started back in high school editing typos and adding things that I noticed were missing — like items to lists. But I had never done anything more than that because I was afraid of it because there are so many rules. Like, I'd seen the talk pages. And many of Wikipedia’s policies and guidelines and essays are very wordy.</p><p>Then I started the account — even though I felt a little like a phony. But I remember the first time I felt really excited about the Wikipedia community was when I got on a call with the president of Wikimedia, New York City, back in 2020. And she had told me about a guy named Jim who retired from working at the phone company. He worked in that big AT&amp;T building that doesn't have windows. I don't know exactly what he did in there — but cables and stuff. Anyway, he's retired now, and he spends all day biking around New York City and taking photos of infrastructure for Wikipedia, because Google Maps photos — and so many other photos — aren't freely licensed. And I was like, that's amazing.</p><p>So I kept hearing about more and more individual people and their shticks. There are a lot of generalists who edit Wikipedia, but there's something so endearing about the people who have just one thing. That's the first time I got excited. That was when I was brave enough to start making bolder changes and writing my own articles.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>Wikipedia's tagline is the </em>“<em>free encyclopedia, created and edited by volunteers around the world,</em>”<em> which makes it sound like a cohesive, happy little family. But as you alluded to, there's a lot of rules. It’s intimidating to write articles. Is it actually the case that there is a Wikipedia community, or is it more accurate to talk about communities within Wikipedia?</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>The answer is both, of course, but when people talk about Wikipedia as a decision making entity, usually they're talking about 300 people — the people that weigh in to the very serious and (in my opinion) rather arcane, boring, arduous discussions. There's not that many of them.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also a lot of islands. There is one woman who mostly edits about hamsters, and always on her phone. She has never interacted with anyone else. Who is she? She's not part of any community that we can tell.</p><p>But then there are hundreds of thousands of editors on English Wikipedia. And within that there are very specific communities that are really interesting. There's the military history WikiProject. Maybe this makes sense because of the whole military thing, but they are very hierarchical. They have a lot of rules. They're very efficient in reviewing articles. Also Wikipedia has a pretty outdated rating system for articles — one of which just got deprecated when “Featured Articles” and “Good Articles” became a thing — except for in military history, because that community was like, well, we need to have every level.&nbsp;</p><p>The same thing is true of the tropical cyclones community. They also do a lot of reviewing, and they also tend to skew very young. It's a lot of teenage boys in tropical cyclones. There's also a very strong anti-vandal community, who similarly skew very young.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>Before I had Wikipedia friends, I did not really understand how many different silos there were.</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>So many. There are acronyms that I hear that I do not know. The anti-vandal people especially are really off in their own world. One of the most effective, consistent, long serving anti-vandalism patrollers is not a teenager. He's a PhD-level material scientist who used to write very high quality articles about chemicals. And then he just got too upset about vandalism and decided “I have to devote hours of my life — even though I have a family and a really demanding job — to this.”</p></div>

</div>
											<div><p><strong>A: </strong><em>What is your sense of the people who do get drawn in and commit so much time. We hear about these people who've edited over three million Wikipedia articles. What's driving them?</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>Well — two things. The three million articles guy, that's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt">Stephen Pruitt</a>. He's wonderful. He kind of became the face of super editors. And it's because the edit count on Wikipedia is an imperfect proxy. Stephen uses bot-assisted editing — which might be something like doing categorization — and so he can do a lot of edits at one time.&nbsp; And so like, yeah, he's made an edit to a bunch of articles, but it's not the same as writing three million articles. But then again, he also writes a lot of articles.</p><p>As to what makes people get sucked in? I think that one shared quality of every single person I've met who has stuck around Wikipedia for a long time is that they have very little hesitation to work hard, and they put a low value on their own time. Maybe they are even willing to waste time. Like, people are very willing to raise concerns and discuss and accept critiques. I also think people tend to care a lot about precise language and about being correct. Some of that comes from the culture of Wikipedia, but I think it's also what predisposes them to edit it in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>Editing can seem incredibly inefficient sometimes, given that Wikipedia is so democratic and anyone can enter into any discussion. Take the page for </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogurt"><em>yogurt.</em></a><em> The debate over whether to call it “yogurt” or “yoghurt” lasted </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Yogurt/yogurtspellinghistory"><em>seven years</em></a><em> and totaled over 140,000 </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Yogurt/Archive_2%23Requested_move_revisited"><em>words</em></a><em>. What happened there specifically, and what makes the process so inefficient in general?</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AR: </strong>I have not read all 140,000 words. That's multiple Shakespeare plays — which I would rather read.&nbsp;</p><p>My impression is that for the debates that last for so many years, people will tap in for a couple of months, and then things will kind of settle, and then they'll tap out and let other people argue. I don't really know what's going on there. I wonder if maybe it's just because people feel so invested because they've already sunk so much time and energy in and think they need to “win.”</p><p>But also — to the yogurt example specifically — when it comes to British versus American English, or Australian or Nigerian or Indian English, basically, the policy is kind of a free-for-all, and that's how it's been for a long time. It usually comes down to whether the topic has to deal with Nigeria or India. If it's about George Bush, then, like, please write it in American English. If not, the rule is to stick with whatever the original writer used. And so that's not always very satisfying. And then there's yogurt. That's not tied to any one country.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>You had a </em><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@depthsofwikipedia/video/7373142677350829358?lang=en"><em>TikTok</em></a><em> about another internal Wikipedia debate. Until 2018, there were no freely licensed photos of Kim Jong Un. No one wanted to violate Korean copyright law (though there was a debate about that). And no media outlets freely licensed any photos. And this never got resolved, and so we had hand-drawn images of Kim Jong Un instead.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>All of which leads to my larger question, which is — is the writing and editing process working?</em> &nbsp;</p><p><strong>AR: </strong>I mean, the answer is no. There are people who just kind of wait for their opponent to get carpal tunnel — and that's not productive for anyone. I would call those sorts of debates tendentious. You're not trying to find consensus. &nbsp;</p><p>I think when it comes to Wikipedia rules and interpreting the rules, it's impossible. You can't follow every single rule. And I'm using the word “rule,” but, on Wikipedia there are “policies,” which are like the Bible. But they change all the time because people work on them. And if you're going to change a policy, then it has to be discussed. And that happens all the time.</p><p>But then there are essays which are just written by a person. And they look a lot like policies! They just have a little thing on the top that says: “This is an essay.” And then there are guidelines! They basically look like rules, and people kind of treat them like rules. And so you can't really follow all of them because there's stuff that contradicts other stuff. It's a Catch-22.</p><p>Back in the day, there were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars">five</a> — call them guidelines, decrees, commandments — sent down from on high from the less good co-founder, Larry Sanger. And the last one was: “Ignore all rules.” And ha! That's still there.&nbsp;</p><p>But within that, there’s a guideline: “Be bold.” And people still talk about both of those all the time. But there are rules where, if you don't follow them, and you don't have good standing or a good reputation, you're gonna get immediately blocked. And so “Ignore all the rules” and “Be bold” aren't actually true.&nbsp;</p><p>And that's the unfortunate thing about growing and becoming a massive encyclopedia that's more respected than it was in 2004. It's a lot harder to truly be this free-for-all, libertarian utopia that the founders thought it might be.</p></div>

</div>
											<div><p><strong>A: </strong><em>You said there's, like, 300 people who are really making a lot of the decisions about Wikipedia editing. Who are they?&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>I threw 300 out there because — if there's a big, big vote — it's generally about 300 people who show up. About two years ago, they changed the Wikipedia skin, and so the table of contents appeared differently, and there was more white space, which people care a lot about. More than 300 people showed up for those votes — and that's about what you can expect for big votes. Usually those people are either administrators, of which, on English Wikipedia, there are fewer than a thousand active. And sometimes they're just people who care a lot about policies.&nbsp;</p><p>Who are they? I think that I can generalize because I go to a lot of meetups. There's a bimodal age distribution. There's a lot of students, very bright college students, grad students, and sometimes a precocious high schooler. (They're the best — I love them.) And then, there's a bunch of retirees. I think common professions are software and computer engineering.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of people work blue-collar jobs. Wikipedia is like their intellectual outlet. And there are some people who are severely disabled in some way, so they don't leave the house for a traditional job — and that gives them more time to edit Wikipedia. It's more male than female.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>You’ve said that the Jimmy Wales, aughts-era goal of “building the sum of all human knowledge” was perhaps not the right goal. Why?</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>There are seven million articles on the English Wikipedia — which is, I think, the biggest Wikipedia. So many of them are getting dusty. They are outdated. They are suffering from, uh, a not very ethical PR person going in there. Basically, it's a lot to maintain. Do you remember Aaron Swartz?</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>Sure.</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>Okay. So he was a Wikipedian. Back in 2006 he put out a <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia">blog post</a> that made a splash because it wasn't what people expected. The thinking back then was — okay, we have these few thousand people that are quite active on Wikipedia — they’re the ones doing all the work, right? And he was like, no. The bulk of Wikipedia's work is very much the people in the background that just see when something's wrong and fix it. Like what I did when I was 18.&nbsp;</p><p>So if the article is cottage cheese, and someone comes in and replaces it with “poop,” those will get fixed right away because first of all, there's anti-vandalism people watching, but also, even if they miss it, people are looking up cottage cheese a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>But if you're vandalizing or if you're doing something sketchy in an article about some&nbsp; really obscure person that doesn't totally meet notability standards and who isn't getting any page views, it's just impossible to maintain that stuff.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>What's the process for something getting deleted?</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>There's this place. We all solemnly march down to it. Anyone who wants to show up can, and then we just vote. It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_for_deletion">articles for deletion</a>. Let's see what's up right now. The most recent thing I deleted was a page that had barely been changed from the 1911 encyclopedia, which was totally plundered back in the day when they were just trying to fill Wikipedia.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>Because it was public domain.</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>Right. And it was a term for a mountain that hadn't been in use since the ‘30s. It was what colonists called it. So it was a duplicate article, essentially.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, you nominate something for deletion, and people vote. Your vote really doesn't count very much if you don't add a reason. But then, once there's been a little bit of discussion, like, I don't know, usually if five people weigh in, that's sufficient. If it's a weird name of an old mountain, people don't really care. But if it's a big deletion, they get really huge.&nbsp;</p><p>I think more than half of the things that get nominated end up getting deleted but I need to double check that. And then, if people don't participate very much for some reason, which usually happens when it's a really boring topic that no one cares about, or it's boring and it's not clear whether or not it should be deleted — then it gets re-listed.</p><p>The standards change sometimes. Once in a blue moon, you'll have a huge deletion event, like — I don't know — we're deleting all the Olympians that don't have sources apart from this one register. So goodbye curlers from 1930! We actually do not know who you are.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>Speaking of sources, we are both editors. We've had the debate, sometimes, over whether or not we should cite Wikipedia. Can you answer this for us?</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AR: </strong>If you're putting anything out into the world, please do not cite Wikipedia! Do not do that. I don't trust it. Ever. That's why you check all the sources. Ideally, every single thing, every single piece of information besides, like, “the sky is blue”-type stuff should be tied to a source. I would say, just cite those because people interpret things weirdly sometimes, and you never know.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>I'm actually surprised to hear you say that though maybe I shouldn’t be. I've definitely had conversations with people that assume that there's been so much work put into Wikipedia at this point — especially on really well sourced articles — that it's trustworthy enough.</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AR: </strong>If it's a featured article, I trust it a little bit more. But I still wouldn't ever do MLA formatting with Wikipedia. But I love to trust Wikipedia when I'm just doing cursory reading about things I am interested in.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>This gets to areas where Wikipedia is strong. The Napoleon page, for instance, has over 500 sources. And you've touched on Wikipedia article grades. Where is Wikipedia strong and where does it need work?</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AR: </strong>Okay, strong suits. Military ships of history. So strong. Tropical storms, strong. US military history, British military history. I would say, generally, it's pretty good on US politics — even local politics. There are articles about pretty much all the recent elections in random counties for the past, like, 75 years.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>This fits with my theory that these are the same people who are going to city council meetings.</em></p></div>
											<div><p><strong>AR </strong>Yeah. Things that are bad? I don't really talk about this as much as I should, but as an editor, I am very passionate about the articles that have a lot of page views but get very little attention from editors. Those often are things that are low-brow pop culture topics that are not naturally interesting to the median Wikipedia editor. For me, the one that I always notice is influencers. Influencers often have horrendous articles. You can tell that somebody that didn't really get the norms of Wikipedia went in there and added —&nbsp; I don't know —&nbsp; six paragraphs about the most minor scandal, all of which cited tabloids.&nbsp;</p><p>Also business articles. Or pages on CEOs. Sometimes those articles are really unbalanced, poorly written, weird, or outdated. That's not good. If they're a powerful person, we should know more about them.</p><p>And then of course people talk about the gender gap. There's been this huge push to write articles about women, and that's been pretty successful. One thing that doesn't really get at, though, is articles about hobbies or topics that are traditionally more popular among females.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>I have some friends who are very into this, and they're going back and fixing the textile history articles.</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>Yes, textiles! It's really amazing how much hasn't changed since 2003, when one Australian woman basically did it all. And then there haven't been a lot of contributions since, which is a huge bummer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>Are there any internal mechanisms in Wikipedia for the allocation of attention beyond just the natural interests of the editors? A clearinghouse for saying: “This thing needs help. Go fix that”?</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AR: </strong>There's the Signpost newspaper, which is Wikipedia's internal newspaper. That always has an “article for improvement” or whatever. There's daily tips that you can sign up for. And then there are big campaigns that come from on high from The Foundation. And those are almost always something like “photograph a monument” because people love to do that and it's a good gateway activity. Or “write a biography about a woman,” which is good. Sometimes there are photograph campaigns for culture or heritage. But you can only nominate so many topics, and they'll only get attention for a week.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>It sounds like Wikipedia needs to bring in newer, different demographics of writers and editors — but you've also alluded to the fact it's very intimidating to start up. Is there a process for acculturating new writers?&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>Yeah, definitely. I care a lot about holding newbies’ hands. A lot of the old timers that came up in 2004 — when there were people who actually believed the “Ignore all rules” thing — they never had to deal with all of the norms that exist now. Even if you're a Nobel Prize winner, just getting all the norms takes a minute. You have to learn it. There are some people who are truly so welcoming and kind that it makes me feel very, very excited and hopeful about the future. And then there are others that are total assholes. And that's how it goes, I guess.&nbsp;</p><p>This happens in a lot of organizations. It's not just Wikipedia. There are people who are very good at what they do, but they're also unpleasant and gruff. They get called “unblockable” because they don't violate the rules enough. But — and I don't know if this is really a trend — from my vantage point it seems like people are less tolerant of the old school, laddish internet type trolling. And that is exciting too.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>Wikipedia is unique in that it still feels very web 1.0 in its design and aesthetics. But it has attracted, like you said, lots of younger editors. You are Gen Z and you are both internet native and also Wikipedia native. How intergenerational is it?</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>The stats on Wikipedia editors are so bad that they're almost useless because people tend to be quite private. And if it's a survey that's coming from the Foundation, there's a whole mistrust of the authority thing. People don't really like to fill those out. But that's the best, objective guess at how multi-generational it is. And that is showing that people are aging. The median, and probably average, Wikipedia editor appears to be older now than ten years ago.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>Okay, you've alluded to the Foundation a couple times, and the tone of it has made it sound like the Capitol in the Hunger Games.</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>It's not that. So there's a lot of overlap. If you love Wikipedia, working at the Foundation is probably your dream job. It's amazing. But people butt heads with the Foundation a lot. It's fun to complain about The Man. That's definitely part of it.&nbsp;</p><p>A major factor is that, maybe four years ago, there was a big flare-up called Forum Gate, which people haven't quite recovered from. Wikipedia has this arbitration committee, and the executives at the Foundation permanently banned a guy who — while he is in the category of gruff, not friendly, not the most empathetic — was a very effective editor on the site. And tons of people either stepped back for a while or resigned in protest.</p><p>Also the Foundation is big now. And I think that some people, even if they don't admit it, hold some jealousy and resentment that there's this fancy office in San Francisco. For a nonprofit job, it's a good one. Whereas the people who actually make the product? They don't make any money. It doesn't always feel like we're trusted by the Foundation.&nbsp;</p><p>But I like the Foundation. There's a natural animosity that comes up sometimes — but overall, we work together. And more than half of the Foundation staff works on the tech — servers, MediaWiki — because you can't get enough volunteers to do that.&nbsp;</p></div>
											
											<div><p><strong>A:</strong> <em>How much authority does the Foundation have over the site?</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AR: </strong>The Foundation doesn't really know what it's there to do. That's kind of what people have been saying for, like, 20 years. Some roles are very clear.&nbsp; If someone is threatening violence, give them to the trust and safety division. If there's a major tech problem, that's the Foundation. The volunteers just don't have the bandwidth for all that. But the patrolling, the determining of the rules, the participating in discussions — the Foundation is very hands off for all of that.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>The Did You Know section on Wikipedia features a trove of random facts every day, and that's run by a bureaucracy of volunteers. But it's not neutrally curated. It's an area for editors to show off their special interests, which has resulted in some topics being, I think, restricted. And some of those are ones you would expect, like Taylor Swift. But apparently, also, such topics as Gibraltar and German hymns?</em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AR: </strong>So it's not like German hymns is “banned,” and neither is Taylor Swift, or even Gibraltar — although that one was a bit more firm. It's mostly just like — hey, can we cool it? Can we cool it with the German hymns?&nbsp;</p><p>The idea behind the Did You Know section is to be interesting for readers, sort of. But really it's there because people want to show off their brand new articles, and we want to let people feel the pride of showing off their new articles. It's also a way to get a mini-review process — to make sure everything in there is cited — and it will get copy-edited for you. It's a good way to get people used to getting edited and reviewed.</p><p>But it's mostly the same squad that does the reviewing. So there are some people who never submit to the Did You Know section, and there are a lot of people that submit everything. So if you pay attention to it consistently you'll be, like, oh, another New Zealand coin. (There's a girl who's been doing lots of those, and she rocks.) Or another article about a time zone! It makes me feel a little tender. It's kind of cute.</p><p><strong>A: </strong><em>People are going to ChatGPT now as their first place to learn about a topic, compared to Wikipedia. I'm curious as to your thoughts on how LLMs are going to shift what Wikipedia feels like, and what you see as the future there.</em></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>The traffic to Wikipedia has not taken a dramatic hit.<strong> </strong>Maybe that will change in the future. The Foundation talks about coming opportunities, or the threat of LLMs. With my friends that edit a lot, it hasn't really come up a ton because I don't think they care. It doesn't affect us. We're doing the same thing. Like if all the large language models eat up the stuff we wrote and make it easier for people to get information — great. We made it easier for people to get information.</p><p>And if LLMs end up training on blogs made by AI slop and having as their basis this ouroboros of generated text, then it's possible that a Wikipedia-type thing — written and curated by a human — could become even more valuable.&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>Mozilla is removing the Do Not Track (DNT) setting from the Firefox browser. This change will take effect in version 135 and beyond, where the DNT setting will no longer be available. The change is already live and can be seen in the Nightly version.</p>



<p>Do Not Track (DNT) is a browser setting that allows users to signal their preference not to be tracked by websites. When enabled, it sends a special <a href="https://windowsreport.com/activate-do-not-track-to-secure-your-browsing-data/">HTTP header to websites indicating the user’s choice to opt out of tracking.</a></p>



<figure><a href="https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/send-websites-a-do-not-track-request-setting-in-Firefox.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="543" src="https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/send-websites-a-do-not-track-request-setting-in-Firefox-1024x543.png" alt="" srcset="https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/send-websites-a-do-not-track-request-setting-in-Firefox-1024x543.png 1024w, https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/send-websites-a-do-not-track-request-setting-in-Firefox-300x159.png 300w, https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/send-websites-a-do-not-track-request-setting-in-Firefox-768x407.png 768w, https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/send-websites-a-do-not-track-request-setting-in-Firefox-700x371.png 700w, https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/send-websites-a-do-not-track-request-setting-in-Firefox-415x220.png 415w, https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/send-websites-a-do-not-track-request-setting-in-Firefox.png 1365w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>send websites a do not track request setting in Firefox. Image credit: WindowsReport.</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Wikipedia</a>, DNT was introduced in 2009 by researchers Christopher Soghoian and Sid Stamm, and Mozilla Firefox was the first browser to implement this feature.</p>



<p>However, as we approach 2025, with growing concerns about online privacy and data protection, Mozilla believes that DNT is no longer an effective privacy measure.<a href="https://windowsreport.com/web-browser-do-not-track-settings-will-no-longer-be-honored-yahoo/"> Many websites ignore the DNT signal</a>. Therefore, Mozilla has removed the DNT signal from Firefox version 135.</p>



<p>We verified the Nightly build’s “Website Privacy Preferences” and confirmed that the option to “Send websites a ‘Do Not Track’ request” is no longer present. This is also confirmed by <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1928087">the bug</a> “Remove DNT control from about:preferences#privacy.”</p>



<figure><a href="https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Do-Not-Track-setting-removed.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="675" src="https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Do-Not-Track-setting-removed-1024x675.png" alt="" srcset="https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Do-Not-Track-setting-removed-1024x675.png 1024w, https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Do-Not-Track-setting-removed-300x198.png 300w, https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Do-Not-Track-setting-removed-768x506.png 768w, https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Do-Not-Track-setting-removed-700x462.png 700w, https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Do-Not-Track-setting-removed-334x220.png 334w, https://windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Do-Not-Track-setting-removed.png 1098w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Firefox Nightly without the Do Not Track Setting. Image Credit: WindowsReport.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Mozilla believes that privacy preference is not honored by websites and that sending the Do Not Track signal may impact your privacy. The company has updated Firefox’s Do Not Track <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-turn-do-not-track-feature">help support page</a> to confirm that.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Starting in <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/find-what-version-firefox-you-are-using">Firefox version</a> 135, the “Do Not Track” checkbox will be removed. Many sites do not respect this indication of a person’s privacy preferences, and, in some cases, it can reduce privacy.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 id="h-do-not-track-alternative-global-privacy-control">Do Not Track Alternative: Global Privacy Control</h3>



<p>The company recommends using the<a href="https://windowsreport.com/firefox-global-privacy-control/"> Global Privacy Control </a>setting as an alternative to prevent websites from tracking user data.</p>



<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you wish to ask websites to respect your privacy, you can use the “Tell websites not to sell or share my data” setting. This option is built on top of the Global Privacy Control (GPC). GPC is respected by increasing numbers of sites and enforced with legislation in some regions. To learn more about this, please read <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/global-privacy-control">Global Privacy Control</a>.</p>

<p>It’s unclear what will happen to users who have DNT enabled when they upgrade to the affected Firefox version. They may see a message stating that “Firefox no longer supports Do Not Track,” or the signal may still be sent to websites. We have asked Mozilla to clarify this and will provide an update when we receive a response.</p>



<p>While Mozilla has removed DNT, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and other browsers still offer this setting. We will have to see if this move impacts these browser vendors to pull DNT support as well.</p>



<p><strong>To enable Do Not Track in Chrome:</strong></p>



<p>Go to Settings &gt; Privacy and Security &gt; Send a “Do Not Track” request with your browsing traffic.</p>



<p><strong>To enable Do Not Track in Microsoft Edge:</strong></p>



<p>Navigate to Settings &gt; Privacy, Search, and Services &gt; Toggle “Send Do Not Track requests” to “on.”</p>



<p>While Firefox itself recommends GPC, you can enhance your privacy by using privacy-focused browsers like Brave and DuckDuckGo, ad blockers, VPN services, and browser extensions such as Privacy Badger.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://windowsreport.com/mozillas-controversial-experiment-to-set-firefox-as-default-browser-during-installation-on-windows-11/">Mozilla started planning to run a bold experiment for Windows </a>that would make Firefox the default browser. This experiment involves a clever trick that affects the Firefox download page and installer.</p>

And the whole "doesn't matter if we sell your trade flows, the rules require you to get best execution" is a farce and everyone in the industry knows this - otherwise there is no reason why Citadel or Virtu would bid billions of dollars to just buy the trade flow.</p><p>2) Are you going to rebate your borrow fees back to investors? This is the other dirty secret way of making money. Many people don't realize that you can earn lending fees by lending your shares out for people looking to short stocks, and those add up to substantial amounts over time for a scaled asset manager. Do you keep this instead of rebating it fully back to your customers?</p><p>3) If the answer is no, you don't sell trade flows and yes, you will rebate your borrow fees, can you make a lifetime commitment that you won't go back on your word? Many people who start in this industry say they won't sell trade flows and then after they reach scale they change the footnotes and agreements and starting selling trade flows.</p></div></td></tr>

Leaning on the flawed argument that they categorically provide retail customers with best price execution quality, there is little by way of self-regulation to foment change or prevent applications designed to optimize transaction volume (i.e. speculation and day trading) and risky activity (i.e. margin and options trading). Further, their ability to claim best execution is part of the flaw of the system, as even within the current structure better outcomes are possible on an order-by-order, and aggregated basis.</p><p><a href="https://advocacy.urvin.finance/advocacy/we-the-investors-pfof-sign-on" rel="nofollow">https://advocacy.urvin.finance/advocacy/we-the-investors-pfo...</a></p><p>Not a win win.</p></div></td></tr>

Otherwise normal people will start out mainstream explainer articles by saying, like, “Robinhood sells your order to Citadel so Citadel can front-run it.” No! First of all, it is illegal to front-run your order, and the Securities and Exchange Commission does, you know, keep an eye on this stuff. Second, the wholesaler is ordinarily filling your order at a price that is better than what’s available in the public market, so “front-running”—going out and buying on the stock exchange and then turning around and selling to you at a profit—doesn’t work. Third, because retail orders are generally uninformative, the wholesaler is not rubbing its hands together being like “bwahahaha now I know that Matt Levine is buying GameStop, it will definitely go up, I must buy a ton of it before he gets any!” The whole story is widely accepted but also completely transparent nonsense.</p></div></td></tr>

Banks are inherently in the business of gambling. Since time immemorial the defining characteristic of a bank is to convert short-term liabilities (deposits) to long-term assets (loans).

I think you’re going to have a hard time convincing me to move from offerings from companies like Barclays, Schwab, or Vanguard.  Plus, zero fees doesn’t save me any money unless you can stay within 0.15% of the big index funds you’re going to be compared too.

There, I said it. [Source: I have 10 years of HFT / market making experience]</p><p>PFOF is misunderstood, as others pointed out here. However, it's not a 'win win win'; it's more like a 'win win lose'. This is something even media gets wrong <i>all</i> the time. I've only seen this mentioned as a footnote in Matt Levine.</p><p>[Note: I don't know if Double is doing it, or if they plan to - this is just a general summary].</p><p>So:</p><p>* Win: Citadel (etc.) make money by trading against order flow that's more benign than the resting orders in public exchanges.</p><p>* Win: The client gets a better execution price than the publicly displayed bid/ask. Back when I started (20+ years ago, yes, I'm old) this was 1/100 of a penny, the legal minimum (due to minimum tick print size). But recently, the market orders in my personal account have been getting price improvement of almost half the spread.</p><p>Things are a bit different in some <i>options</i> exchanges, where retail flow gets some priority, regardless of when you joined a given price point at the order book queue. But almost all equity exchanges use price-time priority, you're almost guaranteed adverse selection.</p><p>Example for those who may need it: if you place a buy limit @ $1.07 in a 1.07 (bid) - 1.08 (ask) market. Then, the bids at 1.07 slowly disappear, because firms such as "Shark Holdings, LLC" (the trading firm consisting solely of quants with unpronounceable foreign-sounding names) will cancel their bids if they sense the market is going down, e.g. if they observe a lot of trades at the bid. Then, the new market will be 1.06-1.07, and you will have sold at the ask.</p><p>OK, so here's who <i>loses</i>: any large orders that have to trade in the open markets (not 'dark pools', ATS, etc.) will be stuck with more 'toxic' orders, and get worse execution. The question is: do I gain more as an <i>individual</i> from having my (quasi-entertainment-value, usually small) personal account orders get better execution? or do I lose more by having my <i>indirect</i> trading (possibly an index fund that I hold my retirement money in) get worse execution? I think it's the latter. But nobody connects the dots and/or seems to care. [Of course, this is more complicated, because large institutional orders aren't 100% on behalf of small investors.]</p><p>You may say this component of market structure is stupid/wrong/suboptimal. I personally think so. But this is the reality of it. It's encased in rules. There was some attempt to get rid of PFOF a couple of years ago, but it failed. So that's not going away.</p><p>So this is a win-win-lose: it's globally suboptimal, but for the 2 first 'wins', it's locally optimal.</p><p>Summary: although PFOF has bad optics and stimulates pitchfork-y instincts ("big bad evil companies are out to gitcha", etc.), if your broker doesn't do it, you're both leaving money on the table - and guess what, they'd have to charge you some other way.</p></div></td></tr>

And you have no chance in hell to provide decent support for that many users in an area as gnarly as finance. You'll be facing a firehose of support requests all the time.</p><p>I'm sorry to sound negative, I really wish you all the best, but even from your post it looks like you had little to no idea what you are doing when you started this (you didn't know stock tickers are ephemeral?). And yet you are asking people to trust you with their money? With the only selling point being that you seem to be unsustainably cheap?

While you do appear to be cheaper than Vanguard for a comparable product, I don't think the risk of switching is worth it. The primary risk I'd be worried about is your business model changing (or you getting acquired by legacy finance) and increasing fees down the line, at which point I'd feel like I'd want to switch back to Vanguard. I'm also worried about exposing myself to your organizational risk (e.g. your internal controls failing and an employe running off with the money, your accountant falling victim to a deepfake scam, etc.) which I suspect is going to be much higher than your competitors. For the additional .17%, I actually feel that Vanguard is a damn good bargain.</p><p>I think your product actually does have a lot of value for folks invested in crappy mutual funds or with some advisor taking a massive AUM fee, but I don't really think those consumers are generally lacking the information required to understand that your product is superior, I think they're just going for something different.</p><p>It's a tough spot. The market size is obviously tantalizing but I feel like the segments are all reasonably well served as it stands. For the folks that you're really targeting, I think it's very hard to beat Vanguard. Their corporate structure and huge size really gives them a massive advantage that seems hard to beat. Best of luck to you folks!</p></div></td></tr>

<p dir="auto"><strong>BareMetal OS</strong> is an exokernel-based operating system crafted entirely in x86-64 assembly and is designed to provide unparalleled levels of flexibility and efficiency. By exposing hardware resources directly to applications, it empowers developers to finely tune and optimize their software for specific tasks. With the exokernel's minimalist design, it minimizes the overhead imposed by traditional operating systems, enabling applications to achieve peak performance. Its x86-64 assembly implementation speaks to its commitment to squeezing every ounce of performance from the hardware, making it a compelling choice for those who demand the utmost control and efficiency from their computing environments.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>BareMetal OS</strong> is under active development. Some physical hardware configurations may not work correctly.</p>

<p dir="auto">Booting via BIOS and UEFI is supported. Secure boot in UEFI mode must be disabled since this software isn't signed. You may need to press <kbd>DEL</kbd> or <kbd>F12</kbd> on the keyboard on power-up to select the boot drive.</p>
<p dir="auto">Debug logging is output via the serial port (115200 bps, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, no flow control). The output should look similar to this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[ Pure64 ]

</code></pre></div>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Important</p><p dir="auto">Booting from a floppy or USB drive works. For BIOS-based floppy boot and UEFI-based USB drive booting there is a RAM drive image loaded that contains the demo programs.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Data source</h3><a id="user-content-data-source" aria-label="Permalink: Data source" href="#data-source"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Initially app started with scraping original <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com</a> thread pages and inside the <a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/docs/old-code/scraper">docs/old-code/scraper</a> folder there is still complete scraper implementation. It uses Axios for fetching html but soon I discovered that their server has very strict rate limiting and such scrapper was getting a lot of unpredictable <code>ETIMEDOUT</code> and <code>ECONNRESET</code> connection abrupt terminations. It's easy to distinguish Axios from browser so I considered moving to Playwright until I discovered Algolia API <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/api" rel="nofollow">https://hn.algolia.com/api</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">As stated in docs it has generous rate limiting plan <code>10000 requests/hour</code> which is <code>2.77 requests/second</code>. Although in practice I experienced more strict rate limits than this, it is still more than enough to easily collect enough data. Especially the fact that you can receive up to 1000 items per a single request. Meaning pagination is almost not needed, although it is implemented. "Who is hiring" threads have up to 700 comments, entire thread can be fetched with a single API request.</p>
<p dir="auto">Company names are extracted with a simple <code>|</code> character Regex from a comment title, this posting convention was enforced around the year 2015, so the database is seeded starting from <code>'2015-06'</code> month. You can see all of this in <a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/constants/algolia.ts">constants/algolia.ts</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Database</h3><a id="user-content-database" aria-label="Permalink: Database" href="#database"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Threads are modeled with <code>Thread</code> and <code>Comment</code> models, although they are named <code>Month</code> and <code>Company</code> because those words make more sense in context of app logic. <code>Company</code> table is both <code>Company</code> and <code>Comment</code> (job ad) at same time, that is why for example self join is used to extract all ads for a company. <code>Month</code> primary key is <code>name</code> string in <code>'YYYY-MM'</code> format which is sortable.</p>
<p dir="auto">Important implementation detail is that database connection is done as Singleton factory function and this way removed from the global scope. This allows the Next.js app to be built without requiring database connection at build time which significantly simplifies the build process. See this <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/35534#discussioncomment-11385544" data-hovercard-type="discussion" data-hovercard-url="/vercel/next.js/discussions/35534/hovercard?comment_id=11385544">Github discussion</a>. The same Singleton factory is reused for both Keyv and Axios instances <a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/utils/singleton.ts">utils/singleton.ts</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can check schema in <a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/modules/database/schema.ts">modules/database/schema.ts</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Database has just a single insert query, when a new month is parsed with scheduled cron job. Or by calling seeding job, which is mostly not needed because the seeded database for a range <code>2015-06</code> - <code>2024-11</code> is provided and committed in Git in <a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/data/database/backup">data/database/backup</a> folder.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is a number of select queries inside <a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/modules/database/select">modules/database/select</a> to extract all wanted data, some of them are more complex. I decided not to use ORM this time and to stick to light weight solution with <code>better-sqlite3</code> library.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Database ER diagram</h4><a id="user-content-database-er-diagram" aria-label="Permalink: Database ER diagram" href="#database-er-diagram"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/docs/screenshots/hn-new-jobs-database-er-diagram.png"><img src="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/raw/main/docs/screenshots/hn-new-jobs-database-er-diagram.png" alt="Database ER diagram"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Caching</h3><a id="user-content-caching" aria-label="Permalink: Caching" href="#caching"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Like stated in the previous section, database is dominantly read only which allowed for easy caching of query responses. This improved SSR pages loading performance from <code>1200 ms</code> to <code>400 ms</code>. There is just a single invalidation event, when new month is parsed, you can see it in <a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/modules/parser/calls.ts">modules/parser/calls.ts</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Keyv library with KeyvFile is used for caching both http requests and database queries into <code>.json</code> files. Invalidating cache entry does not seem to remove it from the <code>.json</code> file to save space, this requires more research and it is added to <a href="#todo">Todo</a> list.</p>
<p dir="auto">Inside the <a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/libs/keyv.ts">libs/keyv.ts</a> there is a <code>cacheDatabaseWrapper()</code> function that accepts database query function and returns cached version.</p>
<p dir="auto">Keyv instances are also removed from the global scope with Singleton factory function.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Scheduler</h3><a id="user-content-scheduler" aria-label="Permalink: Scheduler" href="#scheduler"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Scheduler is needed to execute parsing a new month, every day between 2nd and 15th day every month at 9:00am Belgrade time (<code>'0 9 2-15 * *'</code>). There is an additional logic to skip first two days if those are on weekend in <a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/libs/datetime.ts">libs/datetime.ts</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Scheduler is also useful to seed the database for the entire history and avoid Algolia rate limits.</p>
<p dir="auto">Initial idea was to add cron task inside the Docker image itself. After careful research I discovered that <code>crond</code> daemon must run as <code>root</code> user or it will produce <code>setpgid: Operation not permitted</code> error, see this <a href="https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/381#issuecomment-621946699" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/381/hovercard">Github issue</a>. This was unacceptable because Next.js app needs to run as <code>non-root</code> user for security reasons and easier managing file permissions in Docker bind mount volumes (database, cache, log files).</p>
<p dir="auto">This requires exposing scripts as API endpoints and running <code>crond</code> daemon in a separate Docker image, which is unpractical and greatly complicates deployment. There are 3rd party binaries to run scheduled tasks in Docker, mostly in Go <a href="https://github.com/aptible/supercronic">aptible/supercronic</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Fortunately there are also few Node.js packages to run scheduled tasks, I picked <a href="https://github.com/node-cron/node-cron">node-cron/node-cron</a> for simplicity and practical reasons.</p>
<p dir="auto">Scheduled tasks definitions are in <a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/modules/scheduler/main.ts">modules/scheduler/main.ts</a>. Important note is that they are dynamically imported and invoked in <a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/instrumentation.ts">instrumentation.ts</a> which will guarantee that they are scheduled exactly once and there are no double tasks. Here is <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation" rel="nofollow">Next.js docs</a> about this.</p>
<p dir="auto">Scripts itself are also exposed (and left unused) as API endpoints in <a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/app/api/parser/%5Bscript%5D/route.ts">app/api/parser/[script]/route.ts</a>. They can also be executed manually as <code>tsx</code> scripts in dev mode in <a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/modules/parser/main.ts">modules/parser/main.ts</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Server side rendering</h3><a id="user-content-server-side-rendering" aria-label="Permalink: Server side rendering" href="#server-side-rendering"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Currently there are 115 months in history, it is not practical to prerender that many pages. For performance and SEO reasons server side rendering is always preferred to client side. Month is used as dynamic param, validated by Regex and database lookup, cached database query is read and the page is generated on server at request time. This is true for all 3 pages. Scroll position is stored in localStorage on <code>onChange</code> Select control event, read, restored and cleared on page load. For search page query param is passed as dynamic route param, as described in <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/adding-search-and-pagination" rel="nofollow">Next.js docs</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Docker</h3><a id="user-content-docker" aria-label="Permalink: Docker" href="#docker"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are configurations provided to build Docker images both locally and in Github Actions, for both <code>linux/amd64</code> and <code>linux/arm64</code> platforms. There are also dev <a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/docker-compose.yml">docker-compose.yml</a> and prod <a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/docker-compose.prod.yml">docker-compose.prod.yml</a> files. Two important things to note:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/data">data</a> folder that contains files for SQLite database, cache and logs is exposed to Docker as bind mount. To avoid file permission issues a current user is passed in both dev and prod <code>docker-compose.yml</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are two environment variables required at build time, <code>SITE_HOSTNAME</code> for Next.js metadata and <code>PLAUSIBLE_SERVER_URL</code> for custom Plausible domain. Both are passed into <a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/dockerfile">Dockerfile</a> as build args and you need to provide them whenever you build Docker images (Github Actions, <code>docker-compose.yml</code>, yarn scripts). If you don't app will still run but you will have broken SEO and analytics.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Plausible analytics</h3><a id="user-content-plausible-analytics" aria-label="Permalink: Plausible analytics" href="#plausible-analytics"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">It uses <a href="https://github.com/4lejandrito/next-plausible">4lejandrito/next-plausible</a> package and its configuration is documented in its Readme file. Provider is configured in <a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/components/base-head.tsx">components/base-head.tsx</a> and the API proxy in <a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/next.config.mjs">next.config.mjs</a>. It requires two environment variables, <code>PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN</code> for your website domain, and <code>PLAUSIBLE_SERVER_URL</code> for your self-hosted Plausible instance. Proxy is needed so that <code>script.js</code> is loaded from your local domain instead of remote Plausible server, this will help mitigating adblockers. Important node is that variable used in <code>next.config.mjs</code> needs to be provided at build time.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Logging</h3><a id="user-content-logging" aria-label="Permalink: Logging" href="#logging"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Winston is configured in <a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/libs/winston.ts">libs/winston.ts</a>. Dev logger logs to console and prod logs to both console and html file that should be publicly available. Prod logger is disabled because up to this point I haven't found simple, elegant way to rotate single log file. Simple and obvious thing but somehow unavailable in Winston. Currently it is used only for logging scheduled parsing of new month, more logging should be added.</p>
<p dir="auto">Separate <a href="https://github.com/nemanjam/hn-new-jobs/blob/main/utils/pretty-print.ts">utils/pretty-print.ts</a> function is used to log initial configuration and environment variables on app start.</p>

<!-- <div style="text-align:center;opacity:30%;">Tree Calculus is the most compact Turing complete and intensional logic</div> -->
<!-- <div style="text-align:center;opacity:30%;">One operator. Trivial semantics. Turing complete. Intensional.</div> -->










<ul>
  <li><a name="intensional"></a>
    <h2>Intensional</h2>
    <p>Tree Calculus can perform <strong>program analysis without quotation</strong>:
  The ability to reflect on programs is built right into the reduction rules. This means that anything from type checking to compilation and optimization can happen from within programs and without additional external tools (<a href="https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-program-optimization">🚀demo</a>, <a href="https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-fusion">🚀fusion demo</a>).
  In particular, this supports arbitrary type systems and <strong>truly gradual typing or verification</strong>: Static vs dynamic checks are one and the same function call, just at different points in time (<a href="https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-gradual-typing">🚀demo</a>).</p>

    <p>Furthermore, intensionality allows compiling and deploying programs (or elaborate combinations like <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Tier-splitting-through-declarative-annotation-To-begin-the-partitioning-we-first_fig3_3249568" target="_blank">tier splitting</a>) right from the program itself<!-- (demo TODO)-->. This makes for all-powerful REPLs; translated to Python, imagine using nothing but a Jupyter Notebook for an entire product lifecycle, from prototyping to productionization.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="powerful"></a>
    <h2>Powerful</h2>
    <p>Tree Calculus is Turing-complete and intensional (<a href="https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-turing-intensional">🚀demo</a>).
  Combined with its trivial abstract syntax, it becomes easy to serialize any value, including programs (<a href="https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-serialize-anything">🚀demo</a>).</p>

    <p>But furthermore, there is in fact <strong>no distinction between a program and its encoding</strong>.
  Such distinctions complicate descriptions and formal proofs of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem" target="_blank">Halting Problem</a>, whereas with Tree Calculus as the substrate, Halting Problem formulations become more straightforward (<a href="https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-halting-problem">🚀demo</a>).</p>

    <p>Despite its simplicity, Tree Calculus is not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_tarpit" target="_blank">Turing tarpit</a>. Data encodings and algorithms are <strong>asymptotically optimal</strong>. In practice:
  Typical functions to manipliate lists (map, filter, concat, fold, …) are binary trees with a few hundred nodes (<a href="https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-size-of-meaningful-programs">🚀demo</a>).
  The compiler used in all demos is also written in Tree Calculus, not particularly optimized, yet quite efficient<!-- (demo TODO)-->.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="concise"></a>
    <h2>Concise</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://treecalcul.us/specification">abstract syntax of Tree Calculus</a> is trivial: <strong>Values are unlabeled binary trees</strong>.
  The reduction rules act on trees of higher degree, until they are binary.
  (Bonus for readers familiar with λ-calculus: Recursive functions have normal form/are values in Tree Calculus.)
  The definition is compact, precise and imports no other “well known” definitions or standards,
  such as JSON, UTF8, two’s complement integers, IEEE floats or their respective arithmetic operations, which have tricky corner cases.</p>

    <p>However, arbitrary concepts like that can be bootstrapped in Tree Calculus swiftly and explicitly (<a href="https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-bootstrap-basics">🚀demo</a>).
  This makes Tree Calculus a great language for <strong>modeling and formal specifications</strong>,
  but also very suitable for <strong>education</strong>: There are no incumbent towers of abstraction, but they can be introduced and modeled incrementally<!-- (demo TODO)-->.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="portable"></a>
    <h2>Portable</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://treecalcul.us/specification">syntax and semantics of Tree Calculus</a> are <strong>minimal and self-contained</strong>,
  relying on no platform-specific concepts or abstractions.
  As a result, it is trivial to write interpreters on any platform or in any programming language (<a href="https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-portability">🚀demo</a>).
  Such interpreters are effectively safe by construction, since the reduction rules are simple (resulting in little code) and pure (no inherent access to the environment or resources).</p>

    

    <p>The ability to bootstrap the full power of Tree Calculus anywhere makes it an
  excellent <strong>configuration as code</strong> language in a heterogeneous system.
  Developers could write Tree Calculus programs that generate, say, JSON,
  and use an interpreter (that is tiny compared to a JSON parser) to materialize
  the configuration anywhere (<a href="https://treecalcul.us/live/?example=demo-emit-json">🚀demo</a>).
  <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2016/05/27/production-engineering/python-in-production-engineering/" target="_blank">This article</a> describes how Meta uses Python for a similar purpose.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<!--* <h3>Education</h3> In a world of ever-growing abstractions, the distance between low-level (e.g. hardware, bits) and high-level (e.g. WebRTC, syscalls) can seem unsurmountable for new learners. Tree Calculus lives entirely outside of this stack and has no trouble modeling anything from hardware to complex abstractions. Where real world technology is often opaque, resorts to imprecise specifications (if at all) or assumes familiarity with other concepts (sometimes recursively), Tree Calculus is transparent throughout: Everything is a tree, everything follows the same rules. -->

We also provide plastic cards (think: gift card) for people who don't want to use their phone but we see 80%+ of people interact completely on their phone/online. We have an app and website (same codebase, Quasar framework) and for in-person payment (entry, bar) we provide iPads with connected CC readers.</p><p>My best advice is this: your hardest challenges will not be technical in nature. The hardest part is the equipment, dealing with customers, hand-holding the festival organizers. I don't say any of that as some gross thing or bad thing, just reality. In fact, I think I've succeeded larged based on the in-person aspect (We travel to the event and are on-site for the event) and being the "I have all the answers for your festival payments"-person. Rolling with the punches is a huge part of it.</p><p>The whole thing runs on AWS Lambda with a postgres DB from Neon.tech. I'll be honest, it's incredibly over-architected, the whole thing could run a a couple (or even 1) servers as a traditional NodeJS app without issue (and with less complexity) but I used this project as learning experience and a chance to try our some technology I was interested in. Lambda is incredibly cool and I think I might have one of the best use-cases for it (incredibly spikey load: no traffic for 9 mo, tiny traffic for presales for 1-2 months, 1 month with higher sales, then 1-2 days of the event with crazy sales) but the debugging story isn't the best. SST makes it 10000x better than anything else I've tried and the developer experience is bar-none for writing lambdas but all the other crap (CloudFormation, logs, monitoring, etc) is so much overhead. If I was writing this again today I'd probably look at something like NestJS but I won't let myself re-write the code (again) without a pressing reason and if I need to spend time anywhere it's sales/marketing.</p><p>Here is my, crappy, "marketing" website: <a href="https://grubbux.com/" rel="nofollow">https://grubbux.com/</a></p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>Unsexy tech business making roughly $6-7k/mo. I partnered with a local janitorial company that targets industrial clients with recurring nightly cleaning needs and I make roughly 7% of gross revenue as a recurring weekly payment as long as the client stays on w/o much work. I help do some client support, SEO, and pay for things like Apollo.AI to reach out to customers but other than that it is pretty hands off. I feel very fortunate.</p>

                  <p>I made dividend tracking website. I am a backend engineer, so the UI is simple bootstrap and I focus on having data I find valuable.
I've been working on it since I finished University, so it's like 7 years, and current MRR at $740 isn't great, but at least I don't have to pay for hosting (and financial data sources are expensive).
I believe that spare money should be invested in stocks, so I like that I work on something I use, and will be using in the following decades.
The website is DIGRIN.com (DIvidend GRowth INvesting), good value for free users as well IMHO.</p>

It's similar to escape games, but it's more story driven and easy to do in short sessions and at your own pace.
It started with my wife making the first magazine pretty much by herself. Since then we've made more magazines together and the business is slowly growing.</p><p>We're selling them mainly on our custom lightweight online store. It's done with minimal JS and Node as backend, Stripe as payment provider. We have a Meta pixel to help us track our advertising conversion, but we've disabled cookies, they just felt somehow dirty... It's nice to have power over these things when running your own business. As a next step for the website I'm thinking of including a templating language in the workflow, now I'm still doing edits with search and replace, sometimes missing things... but I do enjoy the simplicity.</p><p>The actual business has two main challenges: 
First is discoverability. It's a pretty unique product, an adventure escape game in a magazine. It doesn't sell well in physical game shops since it doesn't look like a game. We sell well in conventions where we get to explain what the product is, but we also want some weekends for ourselves! Meta ads for our online shop are working surprisingly well though.</p><p>The second and bigger challenge is shipping. Our flat is filled with boxes, and the time I spend sorting magazines, enveloping them, printing address labels, carrying them to the post office... it's really not worth my hourly rate as an engineer (Nor my wife's, but I do it since my schedule is more flexible, and I've automated some parts of the process with a string of incredibly user hostile shell scripts). And the shipping costs are downputting to many, we're quite cornered here in Finland. We are slowly gaining some distribution partners in Europe, but we should also be looking into better shipping options, like perhaps some kind of shipping warehouse exist? Our volume is slowly getting big enough so that it might be feasible. I've only done some cursory googling on this but don't exactly know what I'm even looking for, and there's only so many hours in a day.</p><p>A lot of work, small margins (ads+printing+misc takes a big slice), but around $500 profit per month. Feels absolutely fantastic to have an actual concrete business we own!</p><p><a href="https://cluehound.com/" rel="nofollow">https://cluehound.com</a></p></div></td></tr>

That's the sort of game that springs to mind for many when we explain the concept, and they were definitely an inspiration for us. This however is a more linear adventure, focused around solving enigmas. No choices and no way to lose. Once you know the answer to the puzzle, like "whose fingerprints are on the gun", you turn the next page and the story continues.</p>

We’re <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/apr/25/shocking-truth-money-bands-make-on-tour-taylor-swift">priced out </a>of touring by LiveNation’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/23/nx-s1-4977330/live-nation-ticketmaster-sued">abusive monopolies</a>, and screwed over on royalties as <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2015/02/05/yes-major-record-labels-are-keeping-nearly-all-money-they-get-spotify-rather-than-giving-it-to-artists/">big labels</a> profit from Spotify’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/28/new-law-how-musicians-make-money-streaming">unfair streaming</a> revenue model.&nbsp;</p><p>Music is <a href="https://weareumaw.org/justice-at-spotify">demonetized</a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/spotify-artists-streaming-fraud-1235965379/">censored</a> by DSPs, sued off the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/record-labels-sue-internet-archive-for-digitizing-obsolete-vintage-records/">Internet Archive</a> by major labels, and physical archives have gone up <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2049197/universal-warehouse-fire-artist-list-additions/news/">in flames</a> because of corporate profiteering. It’s no surprise that <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/mental-illness-independent-musicians-study-73-percent-record-union-8509490/#!">mental health</a> is a crisis among musicians—we’re sick with worry wondering if anything will be left of our life’s work.</p><p><strong>The music industry is </strong><a href="https://www.billboard.com/business/business-news/ifpi-global-report-2024-music-business-revenue-market-share-1235637873/"><strong>not struggling</strong></a><strong> anymore. Only musicians are. </strong>We demand a course-correction now, focused on the legacies and futures of working musicians. We call on all record labels, streaming platforms, ticketing outlets, and venues to immediately align on the following goals:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Protect our diverse music legacy.</strong></p><p>The music industry has a moral imperative to keep its history archived, but we can’t trust it to do so. Old records are falling to pieces, and without proper digital preservation, they’ll be gone for good. The masters of big money-making recordings are going <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/neamxm/what-is-a-master-recording-why-are-masters-important-universal-music-group-fire-umg">up in flames</a>, and lesser-known musicians are even more vulnerable to erasure.&nbsp;</p><p>Incredible music and culture is getting lost forever, even though we have the <a href="https://thevinylfactory.com/features/great-78-project-archive-interview/">technology</a> to preserve it. Thanks to the nonprofit Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, almost half a million <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mtv-news-saved-internet-archive-1235051776/">MTV News articles</a> were spared permanent deletion. But when their Great 78 Project rescued over 400,000 recordings, major labels responded with a <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2023/08/14/internet-archive-responds-to-recording-industry-lawsuit-targeting-obsolete-media/">lawsuit</a> against the Internet Archive for <a href="https://great78.archive.org/">research library</a> streams of old vinyl records. Going back to the opening of the library in 2006, the suit seeks <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/internet-archive-major-label-music-lawsuit-1235105273/">$621,300,000</a> in damages. In Spotify bucks, $621,300,000 is <a href="https://soundcamps.com/spotify-royalties-calculator/">261 billion streams</a>—wildly higher than the “millions” of research library streams alleged in the lawsuit. When songs streamed 10 million times would only pay out <a href="https://soundcamps.com/spotify-royalties-calculator/">$23,800</a>, we have to wonder how much our music is really worth.&nbsp;</p><p>Artists and labels alike should partner with valuable cultural stewards like the Internet Archive—not sue them. It’s time to support nonprofit music preservation to ensure that <a href="https://michigantoday.umich.edu/2024/02/23/george-gershwins-first-musical-rediscovered-after-nearly-a-century/">our music</a> and our stories aren’t lost to history.<br><strong><br>2. Invest in living, working musicians–not back catalogs or monopolies.<br></strong><br>In 2022, music rights was a <a href="https://pivotaleconomics.com/undercurrents/music-copyright-2022">40 billion dollar</a> business. But a disproportionate cut of those billions are made by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/opinion/private-equity-music-spotify.html">private equity</a> exploiting the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/music-catalogs-value-keeps-rising-could-it-change-the-face-of-the-entire-industry-1056229/">back catalogs</a> of legacy musicians, many of whom are no longer living. Working artists took home <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/musicians-received-12-percent-43-billion-generated-by-music-industry-study-2018-8?op=1">as little as 12%</a> of music industry revenue, even before COVID decimated touring. Meanwhile CEOs hire <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fightfortheftr/video/7267303386683297067">lawyers</a>, <a href="https://loudandclear.byspotify.com/#takeaway-7">publicists</a>, and <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/recording-industry-assn-of-america/summary?id=D000000581">lobbyists</a> to convince the public that music is <a href="https://themusic.com.au/industry/spotify-ceo-faces-backlash-after-saying-the-cost-of-making-content-is-close-to-zero/CpqwHB8eAQA/03-06-24">essentially worthless</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, we’re shut out of sharing in today’s <a href="https://www.iq-mag.net/2019/09/global-live-music-ticket-sales-top-25bn-pwc-outlook-2019/#.XYvSoZNKjOQ">historic highs in live concert revenue</a>. Musicians, including big-name artists like <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2205718/lorde-concert-industry-explainer-email-touring/news/">Lorde</a> and <a href="https://torontolife.com/city/musicians-like-me-can-no-longer-afford-to-tour-live-music-wont-survive-unless-the-industry-changes/">Animal Collective</a>, shouldn’t lose money self-funding tours that cost <a href="https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/press-play-with-madeleine-brand/reproductive-rights-india-lds-music/touring-money">40% more</a> post-pandemic. This exploitation comes at the hands of <a href="https://prospect.org/power/2024-05-24-how-live-nations-monopoly-works/">monopolies</a> double-dipping into both ticketing and venue income, and gravely harms the workers and independent live music spaces that also comprise the touring ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>Venues and ticketing retailers must set a precedent to ensure that artists get a fairer deal, including keeping <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/article/artist-merch-cuts-venues/">100% of merchandise</a> sales, as suggested by the Featured Artist Coalition &amp; United Musicians and Allied Workers’ #MyMerch campaign. We need transparent ticketing practices that prioritize income for artists and clarity for fans, so that live music work can actually make artists a living.<br><strong><br>3. Make streaming services pay fair compensation.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The music industry must put musicians before big tech. Lobbyist organizations should redirect their power into making the government <a href="https://tlaib.house.gov/posts/tlaib-introduces-living-wage-for-musicians-act">appropriately tax</a> streaming platforms to fund artists, rather than side with monopolistic corporate players.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, representatives Rashida Tlaib and Jamaal Bowman introduced the Living Wage for Musicians Act in partnership with United Musicians and Allied Workers to fight for fair pay in streaming. <a href="https://weareumaw.org/news/justiceatspotify-a-year-in-review">30,000 working musicians and counting</a> also signed onto UMAW’s #JusticeatSpotify campaign, demanding similar goals of fair compensation from DSPs. Artists have clearly voiced concern that <a href="https://thehustle.co/the-economics-of-spotify">the numbers</a> aren’t adding up in our favor.&nbsp;</p><p>Major labels must put forth a public plan with a concrete timeline to end their vertical investment in platforms like Spotify, whose CEO Daniel Ek profits more <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/daniel-ek-spotify-earnings">in one year</a> than Taylor Swift has in her lifetime. The music we make today is valuable, and it’s time for the industry to treat it that way and invest in working musicians by paying fair royalties for streams.&nbsp;</p><p>We demand that the music industry stop treating the history and future of musicians as expendable. Thanks to many self-organized groups and collectives, music workers are better organized now than at any other point in history. The inequity that permeates the lives of working artists, <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/Authors-For-Libraries">in all media</a>, will end. Through the collective power of artists and those that love our work, we will build a sustainable future where our wellbeing and dignity come first.&nbsp;</p><p>The music industry cannot survive without musicians. The only way it can continue is with immediate and sustained action to protect artists’ futures, and the long-term preservation of their works. We implore our labels, our agents, our publishers, and our venues to stand with us in demanding fairness for the artists on which this industry is built.&nbsp;</p><p>Sincerely,</p></div>

<p>Compilers have always been surrounded by an air of mystery and magic. This has
led many of us to believe that they do things (well) that they don't, or that
they don't do things (well) that they do.<a href="#footnote1" id="footnote1-back">1</a>
</p>
<p>In this article is one some way a follow-up of a previous one on <a target="_blank" href="https://sbaziotis.com/compilers/compiler-opt.html">compiler optimization</a>. Here, I've collected some misconceptions I've come across over the
years (many of them mine), doing my best to clear up any confusions. As a heads
up, this article is only about large-scale, mainstream, general-purpose
compilers like LLVM, GCC, and ICX. Some of the statements don't apply e.g., to
domain-specific compilers<a href="#footnote2" id="footnote2-back">2</a> or small-to-medium-scale compilers.<a href="#footnote3" id="footnote3-back">3</a> Please do let me know if you'd like to see an article
on other classes of compilers.

<p>First, optimal according to which metric? For example, one metric is code size.
But usually the metric compilers target is running time (i.e., latency of
a single run of the program). In any case, though, “optimization” is a misnomer.
Compilers don't even try to find the optimal program. Instead, they first lower
the program in a very <a target="_blank" href="https://sbaziotis.com/compilers/compiler-opt.html#unoptimized-builds">simple manner</a>,
and then they just try to <i>improve</i> that. “Improving” is much weaker than “optimizing”,
but it is accurate.
</p>
<p>But why don't we get the optimal program? Well, it's very hard and slow. For
code size there may be some hope of producing optimal programs in a reasonable
time some day because code size as a metric has a bunch of nice properties. For
example, we can measure code size extremely accurately and reliably; it's
basically just the file size of the generated program. Also, different
measurements give you the same exact value (i.e., if you measure the size now
and after a minute, you'll get the same value). Finally, code size has
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_substructure">optimal
substructure</a>. <b>UPDATE: Actually, I seem to have proved myself wrong here.
See <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42375191">this comment</a>.
Hopefully, I will find some time to revisit this.</b><s>
To see what this means in practice, let's say you have a function <code>A</code> whose
size you want to minimize (i.e., find the minimum size). Now, let's say
you split the function in two parts and you find their minimums independently.
Optimal substructure tells us that if you just merge these two, you'll
get the minimum version of the whole function. In other words, combining
individual minimums gives you a global minimum.</s>
</p>
<p>Running time, on the other hand, has none of that. First, you can't measure it
accurately. Different runs of the program will have slightly different running
times. Worse yet, the factors that impact the running time are <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1508284.1508275">many and subtle</a>.
Moreover, improving the running time doesn't have optimal substructure. For example,
you have the optimal version two loops individually, but the global minimum
may require fusing these two loops. Finally, <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/p15qRHZ_Leg?t=951">“we have absolutely no proper models of the machines we're compiling for”</a>. This is something recent academic work discovered
the hard way. <a target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3276480">goSLP</a> generates globally optimized
SLP-vectorized code. But optimized according to what? According to hardware models. Because
these models are bad<a href="#footnote4" id="footnote4-back">4</a>, the authors discovered that the generated programs were not only <i>not</i> optimal, but they could be <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/wiwloa0g02g?t=1946">slower than LLVM</a>!

    </div><br>

<div>
<p>In most modern compilers, including GCC, LLVM, and ICX, conditional branches can
have weights. These are basically probabilities of whether the branch will be
taken or not. Such weights are added either by profile-guided optimization
(PGO), or by the programmer using intrinsics such as <code>__builtin_expect</code>:
</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>__builtin_expect</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>// The branch is likely to be taken</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The misconception here is that for x86 architectures, the compiler generates
branch hints for the <i>CPU</i>'s branch predictor. Until pretty recently, that was
simply not the case. Even though Intel introduced branch hints in Pentium 4,
they found that in practice there was no performance benefit and they just
increased code size.<a href="#footnote5" id="footnote5-back">5</a>
You can still include branch hints in your assembly, but the CPU simply ignores them.
</p>
<p>So, what are these hints/weights used for? They are hints to the <i>compiler</i>'s
“branch predictor” which it uses primarily to place code blocks effectively. For
example, if a branch is likely, the compiler places its target block directly
below the current block so that execution falls through to it, to increase
instruction cache locality.
</p>
<p>But, Intel recently introduced an architecture, Redwood Cove, in which branch
hints are relevant again.<a href="#footnote6" id="footnote6-back">6</a>
So, the compiler will theoretically generate these hints for this architecture.
</p>
<p>However, it's hard to see it in practice. I couldn't produce any example where
you give a C example to the compiler and with some combination of flags, it
gives you x86 assembly that has branch hints; for any of: GCC, LLVM, or ICX.
I don't even know how to specifically target Redwood Cove. But,
we <i>can</i> make it generate the hints. We take this LLVM IR code:<a href="#footnote7" id="footnote7-back">7</a>

<div>
<p>In 2019, which is not that long ago in compiler years, Emery Berger gave a talk
at the Strange Loop Conference. In that talk, he showed evidence for the
following stark statement: there's no statistical difference between <code>-O2</code> and
<code>-O3</code> in Clang!<a href="#footnote9" id="footnote9-back">9</a> 
That's also what I've found in my experience, especially with Clang. GCC's <code>-O2</code> is less aggressive
than Clang's, so there is some difference there, but not a big one. Also,
<code>-O3</code> ignores the code size almost completely, and that can get you into trouble
with the instruction cache.
</p>
<p>The moral of the story is: this is not a rule. It's one of these cases that it pays
to benchmark.

<div>
<p>This depends a lot on the case. Yeah, probably for C/C++ pipelines, an
interpreter won't be super useful anywhere, and good lucking making one anyway.
But there are cases where an interpreter can be useful. One interesting case is
that of WebAssembly.
</p>
<p>Recently, Ben Titzer published a paper titled: <a target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3563311">A Fast In-Place Interpreter for WebAssembly</a>. In this paper, Titzer tells us α story about WebAssembly implementations.
</p>
<p>You see, for non-native languages, you usually develop an interpreter first, and
<i>then</i> a (JIT) compiler. This is because an interpreter is usually easier to
develop and use, while the compiler is something you need for performance.
Interestingly, however, in WebAssembly ecosystem, JIT compilers were developed
first. As far as I can understand, that was a factor of three things, discussed
next.
</p>
<p><strong>Designed for Compilation</strong>. WebAssembly was designed for compilation and
that's because performance was a core goal, not an after-thought. Performance,
in this case, means both performance of the produced code, but also efficiency
of the compilation. For example, WebAssembly can be type-checked in a single
pass.
</p>
<p><strong>Convince</strong>. Even though WebAssembly had “political” power from the
beginning<a href="#footnote10" id="footnote10-back">10</a>, the designers
still wanted to convince folks and give evidence that WebAssembly is indeed a viable option
for users who care about performance. And you can't give evidence for that
without a compiler.
</p>
<p><strong>Not Ideal for Interpretation</strong>. The design for compilation brought about
some features that made it hard to implement an interpreter. Most notably,
structured control flow. In the paper, Titzer describes the pain points very well.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, folks eventually realized that interpreters had a bunch of
advantages. Titzer gives a nice account of six advantages in Section 1.1 of the
paper. The gist of the matter is that while you can't usually beat a compiled
binary's performance, there are other practical reasons to have an interpreter.

  <p>LLVM has the most popular middle-end, and that is not the case for LLVM. I wrote

    </div><br>

<div>
<p>Almost certainly not!<a href="#footnote11" id="footnote11-back">11</a> Yes, compilers
will optimize for <i>instruction</i> cache locality; we saw that <a href="#branch-weights-and-the-cpus-branch-predictor">earlier</a>. There is
also a long history of compiler research for cache optimizations<a href="#footnote12" id="footnote12-back">12</a>;
none of it has made it into mainstream compilers. <a target="_blank" href="https://polly.llvm.org/">Polly</a>
is the most serious case (I know) of a data-locality optimization framework<a href="#footnote13" id="footnote13-back">13</a> becoming part of
a big mainstream compiler. Still, it is not turned on by default in LLVM.
</p>
<p>Mike Acton has gathered himself some 690 thousand views in his CppCon talk
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc">Data-Oriented Design and C++</a> in
no small part because he drove the point home that a C++ compiler won't optimize
cache locality for you. This talk basically started<a href="#footnote14" id="footnote14-back">14</a> the movement of data-oriented design, whose
main goal is to write code that makes good use of the cache.
</p>
<p>But, you may be asking <i>why</i> the compiler won't do it for you. Unfortunately, it
cannot. First, optimizing for data locality requires mass-scale intrusive
changes to the program. For example, let's say you have an open-addressing hash
table. More specifically, here's how LLVM <code>DenseMap</code>'s data layout looks like:
</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>DenseMap</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>BucketT</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>KeyT</span><span> </span><span>Key</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>ValueT</span><span> </span><span>Value</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>};</span>
<span>  </span><span>unsigned</span><span> </span><span>NumBuckets</span><span>;</span>
<span>  </span><span>BucketT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>Buckets</span><span>;</span>
<span>...</span>
</pre></div>
<p>So, we have a single array in which every entry has the key and the value paired
together. But, during lookups, we only care about the keys. The way the data is
structured, we keep loading the values into the cache, wasting cache space and
cycles. One way to improve that is to split this into two arrays: one for the
keys and one for the values.
</p>
<p>To keep the code behavior the same, we would have to change <i>every</i> place in
which this original array is used: the allocations, where we get a key, where we
set a value, etc. In C/C++, this is very hard to do reliably. But most
importantly, the compiler is plainly not allowed to do it. Generally, a C/C++
compiler is simply not allowed to re-order the struct fields.<a href="#footnote15" id="footnote15-back">15</a>
</p>
<p>Last but not least, even if the compiler was allowed to do it, the abstractions
in C/C++ programs are too impoverished in information for the compiler to identify such
opportunities.<a href="#footnote16" id="footnote16-back">16</a> In simple terms, the compiler has a very imprecise
view of a program's memory accesses to have any good idea of what layout
optimizations would be beneficial.

      <p><span id="-o0-gives-you-fast-compilation">-O0 gives you fast compilation</span> <span><a href="#-o0-gives-you-fast-compilation"></a></span></p>
    </div><br>

<div>
<p>Mainstream compilers like Clang and GCC are very slow, so it's more accurate to
think that <code>-O0</code> gives you debuggable and predictable code, rather than that it
will give you the code fast.
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, yes <code>-O0</code> is faster than say <code>-O2</code>, although I don't have a
large-scale experiment to back this up. But for example, compiling a <code>Release</code>
build of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/facebook/zstd">zstd</a> takes ~34s, while a <code>Debug</code>
build takes ~11s. Something similar is true for <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/baziotis/minijava-cpp">one of my projects</a>
which uses a unity build and has about 5K lines of code. However, even saying
that <code>-O0</code> is always faster than <code>-O2</code> is not true. As an example, in my
desktop, it takes ~25min to compile a <code>Debug</code> version of LLVM,  but ~23min to
compile a <code>Release</code> version.<a href="#footnote17" id="footnote17-back">17</a>
</p>
<p>Point being, if really want fast compilation, you need to somehow bypass the
standard compilation pipeline, especially if you're starting from C++. One
option is to just use a smaller compiler, as these are usually faster (e.g.,
TinyCC). Another option is to at least skip <i>some</i> of the compilation stages.
One way to do that is to directly generate LLVM IR, something databases
researchers have observed too. In a popular 2011<a href="#footnote18" id="footnote18-back">18</a> query compilation paper,<a href="#footnote19" id="footnote19-back">19</a>, the authors say:
</p>
<p>[Compiling LLVM IR] usually requires only a few milliseconds for query compilation, while C or C++ compilers would need seconds</p>
<p>And query compilation is one use case where fast compilation matters since it's
online.
</p>
<p>It is easy to see why the quote is true if the compiler we use is Clang because
Clang anyway needs to go through LLVM IR. Also, C/C++ doesn't have a binary
format, which would speed up processing, only a textual format. However, LLVM IR
does.

<div>
<p>Not really... <i>C++</i> templates are slow to compile because C++'s compilation
model is terrible.<a href="#footnote20" id="footnote20-back">20</a> Templates, of course, increase
the compilation complexity, but not in a way that makes them impractical.
</p>
<p>A case in point is Dlang's standard library,
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dlang/phobos">Phobos</a>. In my not-particularly-fast laptop,
compiling Phobos takes about 12 seconds even though it has more than 250
<i>thousand</i> of lines of code <i>full</i> of templates in an <i>optimized</i> build.<a href="#footnote21" id="footnote21-back">21</a> Note that DMD, D's main compiler, doesn't do
anything particularly fancy. Of course, Walter Bright—the mastermind
behind D and DMD—is one of the best compiler engineers ever and he
definitely knows more than a thing or two about how to make a compiler run fast.
But DMD doesn't do anything crazy; it's not even multi-threaded.

    </div><br>

<div>
<p>Separate compilation is the idea that you compile a different object file for
each source file.<a href="#footnote22" id="footnote22-back">22</a> The
reasoning of why this is beneficial is that if you change one source file, you
only have to re-compile that one file and "just" link it with the other object
files; you don't have to re-compile the whole project.
</p>
<p>This sounds attractive and has become some kind of sacred creed in computer
science education,<a href="#footnote23" id="footnote23-back">23</a>
and from there has crept into production environments. The problem is that in
practice, linking is incredibly slow. Unfortunately, I have not studied linking
deeply enough to comment on whether the problem is inherent or not.<a href="#footnote24" id="footnote24-back">24</a> But little does that
matter; reality is what it is.
</p>
<p>So, for <i>many</i> projects, separate compilation is not worth it. Instead, a unity
build—where you just include everything into a single file—is
usually a much better option. Let me give you some examples. First, I have
confirmed that it's not worth it for <i>every</i> C/C++ project I have written. So,
say up to 20K lines of code in a single project. For example,
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/baziotis/minijava-cpp">minijava-cpp</a> is a MiniJava compiler
written in C++ which has some pretty heavy code in it. It compiles in ~0.7s in
my laptop, while linking all these separate files takes much longer. In short, I
have never come across a case in my projects where separate compilation is
better than a unity build.
</p>
<p>Beyond personal experience, Ubisoft has also
<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/qYN6eduU06s?t=601">reported</a> using unity builds to improve
compilation times of its games.<a href="#footnote25" id="footnote25-back">25</a> SQLite, too, compiles
everything into a single <code>.c</code> program.
</p>
<p>Beyond compilation times, unity builds have other advantages. For example, you
get whole-program optimization without needing to apply link-time optimization
(see below). Also, everything is compiled only once, something that contributes
a lot both to faster compilation speeds and nicer error logs. With C++'s
compilation model (see <a href="#templates-are-slow-to-compile">above</a>), if you
include the same file in different translation units (or files for simplicity),
it will get compiled once for every unit. If you now add on top that templates
generate many versions of the same thing, you have the same code being
re-compiled over and over.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, I cannot make the statement that separate compilation is never
useful, because I don't have the evidence to support that. But, I have never
found it to be a win in my projects, and that seems to be the case for some big
projects too. So, give unity builds a try.

<div>
<p>Here's a story. Two years ago, I was auditing Vikram Adve's<a href="#footnote26" id="footnote26-back">26</a> course “Advanced Compiler
Construction”. At some point during the class, Vikram posed the million dollar
question: why does link-time optimization happen at link-time? This may sound
like an oxymoron, but in reality the question is: why does whole-program
optimization happen at link-time?
</p>
<p>This is a very reasonable question because no one actually cares about link-time
optimization; people care about whole-program optimization. And linkers are
generally not optimizers, it is not their job. In fact, theoretically it makes
much more sense for whole-program optimization to happen in the middle-end.
First, the middle-end's job <i>is</i> optimization. Second, the middle-end
operates in an IR made for optimization, contrary to the assembly that object
files normally have. Furthermore, nothing prevents the compiler from having a global view
of the program. It can just translate all the input C/C++ files to LLVM IR, and
then has a view over the whole program. Then, Dear God, why does it happen at
link-time? I should say, no one knew the answer. Thankfully, Dear God
illuminated us.
</p>
<p>Vikram explained (well, I'm paraphrasing) that the answer lies in the sad
reality of C/C++ build systems. In huge projects, good luck finding the source
C/C++ files and figuring out what calls what. The C++ tooling is just not made
for that. On the other hand, it's necessary that a linker be able to find all
the object files. So, the tooling is such that a linker <i>can</i> gather all the
code for a project. Of course, normally object files contain assembly and no one
wants to work on that. So, the compiler just sticks e.g., the LLVM IR into the
object file for the compiler to access it.

<p>Avoiding a call instruction (sequence) is beneficial, but even that is partly
beneficial due to instruction cache locality, not because the instruction is
that slow. Most importantly, though, inlining's biggest benefit (by far) is that
it's an enabling transformation, meaning it enables other optimizations. I have
a more detailed explanation <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/I4Iv-HefknA?t=1084">here</a>, but let
me highlight one frequently overlooked effect of inlining.
</p>
<p>Inlining enables interprocedrural optimization without actually the need for any
interprocedural compiler techniques (apart from inlining itself).
Interprocedural optimization techniques are those that involve more than one
procedure (i.e., function), i.e., they optimize <i>across</i> functions.
Interprocedural optimizations are difficult to implement exactly because they
involve multiple functions. Optimizations are anyway usually difficult to extend
beyond a small set of basic blocks or a single loop, let alone beyond function
boundaries. Inlining, however, in effect allows interprocedural optimization to
happen. For example, suppose you have the following code:
</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>sat_div</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>num</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>denom</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>denom</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>?</span><span> </span><span>INT_MAX</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>INT_MIN</span><span>;</span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span>
<span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>num</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>denom</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>int</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>sat_div</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>);</span>
<span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>After optimization, the code for <code>foo</code> looks like (<a target="_blank" href="https://godbolt.org/z/Gfr1rjMvj">godbolt</a>):
</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// ... sat_div is the same</span>

<span>int</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>// The generated code for this looks confusing because</span>
<span>  </span><span>// the compiler has turned a division into a multiplication.</span>
<span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>So, the compiler performed constant propagation, by propagating the constant <code>3</code>
to <code>denom</code>, it eliminated the dead <code>if</code> as the condition is false in this case,
and it turned the division into a multiplication. But how did it do it? Well,
not through interprocedural versions of constant propagation<a href="#footnote27" id="footnote27-back">27</a>, dead-code elimination, or instruction
combining. No, the effect happened because the compiler first inlined the call
to <code>sat_div</code> (<a target="_blank" href="https://godbolt.org/z/4TdaG9Wz7">godbolt</a>), which then <i>enabled</i>
the <i>intra</i>procedural<a href="#footnote28" id="footnote28-back">28</a> versions of these
transformations. In other words, inlining brought everything into a single
function, which allowed the conventional transformations to work. This is why inlining is considered by many
(e.g., <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/FnGCDLhaxKU?t=1580">Chandler Carruth</a>) the single most
important optimization in optimizing compilers.<a href="#footnote29" id="footnote29-back">29</a>
</p>
<p>Does that mean that inlining is the only approach to interprocedural optimization? Well, on the
one hand, there is a long literature of interprocedural optimizations, and some
of it has made it into production compilers.<a href="#footnote30" id="footnote30-back">30</a> On the other hand, for
most mainstream compilers, almost all the interprocedural work is done by
inlining. This is also why virtually all recent research on compiler cost models
that that related to interprocedural optimization target inlining.<a href="#footnote31" id="footnote31-back">31</a>

<p>Most of the documentation on this keyword is devoted to its role in linking. And
indeed, this is where it matters semantically. But the question I'm here to
answer is: Does it have to do anything with the inlining optimization?
</p>
<p>This was supposed to be an easy one. After all, Chandler Carruth <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/FnGCDLhaxKU?t=1560">told
us</a> that “the <code>inline</code> keyword in C++ has
possibly nothing to do with optimization”.<a href="#footnote32" id="footnote32-back">32</a> But the story is not so simple. On the one hand, cppreference tells us
that:
</p>
<p>The original intent of the inline keyword was to serve as an indicator to the optimizer that inline substitution of a function is preferred over function call.</p>
<p>and if we look at the
<a target="_blank" href="https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/n4993.pdf">latest</a> C++
standard draft<a href="#footnote33" id="footnote33-back">33</a>, it
says<a href="#footnote34" id="footnote34-back">34</a>:
</p>
<p>The inline specifier indicates to the implementation that inline substitution of the function body at the point of call is to be preferred to the usual function call mechanism. An implementation is not required to perform this inline substitution at the point of call.</p>
<p>On the other hand, cppreference also tells us:
</p>
<p>[...] the meaning of the keyword inline for functions came to mean "multiple definitions are permitted" rather than "inlining is preferred" since C++98, that meaning was extended to variables.</p>
<p>With all these conflicting statements by credible sources<a href="#footnote35" id="footnote35-back">35</a>, it's reasonable to expect a confusion. So, what is the
truth? As with many things in C++, the “truth” is whatever the implementation
has chosen. Since I am most familiar with LLVM, we'll take a look at that.
</p>
<p>So, LLVM does pay attention to the <code>inline</code> keyword, and has been doing so since at least 2010. LLVM IR has the <code>inlinehint</code><a href="#footnote36" id="footnote36-back">36</a> attribute which Clang will add to your function
definition if you add the <code>inline</code>
keyword.<a href="#footnote37" id="footnote37-back">37</a>. For example, in this <a target="_blank" href="https://godbolt.org/z/jfo35vvzf">snippet</a>, Clang adds the <code>inlinehint</code> attribute to <code>int_run</code>. According to the LLVM IR reference on <code>inlinehint</code>:
</p>
<p>This attribute indicates that the source code contained a hint that inlining this function is desirable (such as the “inline” keyword in C/C++). It is just a hint; it imposes no requirements on the inliner.</p>
<p>Indeed, the optimizer increases the inline threshold for functions that have the <code>inlinehint</code> attribute.<a href="#footnote38" id="footnote38-back">38</a> But the change is relatively small. So, yes the <code>inline</code> keyword has something to do with optimization, and yes the optimizer will care if you add it; but not too much (sorry!). I guess if you really want a function to be inlined, you should add the <code>always_inline</code> specifier, which is a totally different story: the compiler will always inline these functions, no matter what, unless it's impossible.

    </div><br>

<div>
<p>Look, I love LLVM!<a href="#footnote39" id="footnote39-back">39</a> In many ways, it's pretty educational. But it's a monstrosity! That's because LLVM is applied to <i>so many</i> use cases. LLVM is used from embedded systems to Google's data centers, from JIT compilers to aggressive high-performance scenarios, and from Zig to Rust to &lt;name the next new language&gt;. So, unavoidably, if you study LLVM, you'll come across <i>a lot</i> of edge and special cases it tries to handle which are of little educational value. You will also see a bunch of advanced algorithms. For example, the standard <a target="_blank" href="https://sbaziotis.com/compilers/semidominators-proof.html">Lengauer-Tarjan Algorithm</a> is already hard to understand. LLVM uses an even more advanced <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNV18Wy-J0U">algorithm</a> that was introduced recently.
</p>
<p>So, while I definitely suggest that you take a serious look at LLVM internals at
some point, I don't suggest that you start there. Just to be clear: this is if you are
interested in learning about compiler <i>development</i>. If you are a user, LLVM is
probably the best choice. So, to <i>learn</i> compilers, as I suggested in a Reddit
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Compilers/comments/1h4qscz/comment/m02plue/">comment</a>,
you can take a look at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNV18Wy-J0U">Go compiler</a>.
It's a production compiler, with some <i>very</i> serious people behind it, but it's not the monstrosity
that LLVM is. I also learned a lot from the folks at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc">LDC</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dlang/dmd">DMD</a>.

<div>
  <p>Nope, undefined behavior can also disable optimizations. I wrote an <a target="_blank" href="https://sbaziotis.com/compilers/definedness-removing-optimization-limitations-of-undefined-behavior.html">article</a> on this.
</p>

    </div><br>

<div>
<p>Generally speaking, a compiler is always allowed to define undefined
behavior.<a href="#footnote40" id="footnote40-back">40</a> For example, the compiler is allowed to define a dereference from a
<code>int*</code> pointer that points to <code>NULL</code> to be <code>0</code>. But, this has performance
repercussions, as that would e.g., require that the compiler insert <code>if</code>s in
every pointer dereference.
</p>
<p>A more subtle argument is that the compiler can define all undefined behavior to
be the platform's behavior. This would kill two birds with one stone. First, the
compiler wouldn't need to add any extra code because the behavior it would have
chosen would be what the target would do anyway. As such, there would be no extra
overheads. Second, suddenly as a programmer you would know <i>exactly</i> what would
happen. While this argument sounds great, it is truly not that simple. I wrote
an
<a target="_blank" href="https://sbaziotis.com/compilers/defining-all-undefined-behavior-and-leveraging-compiler-transformation-apis.html">article</a>
that examines this suggestion seriously and in detail.

<p>The recent explosion in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has not left compilers
untouched. In many cases, for a good reason. For example, cost models are one
plausible application of machine learning. For simplicity, here's how a cost
model works: it is given a space of possible solutions and it chooses one them.
For example, let's say you have a loop that can be tiled be a factor of 16, 32,
or 64. You may, then, have a cost model that is asked to choose among the four
options: not tile at all, or tile by any of the three factors.
</p>
<p>For the longest time, cost models have been written and maintained by hand.
However, hand-tuned cost models are often boring to make, hard to scale
(especially as the number of architectures increases), and anyway hardware
vendors tell us so little about their architectures that hand-tuned cost models
are (as machine-learning-based ones) black magic; they are not interpretable or
intuitive. In other words, a great case for machine learning and neural
networks because they can automate the process. Indeed, a lot of research on machine-learning cost models has appeared the last decade, and some have even made into production. For example, recently Google adopted a neural network <a target="_blank" href="https://proceedings.mlsys.org/paper_files/paper/2021/file/6bcfac823d40046dca25ef6d6d59cc3f-Paper.pdf">cost model</a>
for its XLA compiler.
</p>
<p>But there's a catch. Cost models are good application of neural networks because
you don't need any strict guarantees. In particular, the way to think about it
is that cost models are given a set of <i>correct</i> programs to choose from. As such, <i>no matter</i>
which choice the cost model makes, the generated code will be correct!<a href="#footnote41" id="footnote41-back">41</a> So, even though neural networks currently have this “minor” issue that we
have no idea how they work and they have no guarantees, this is fine e.g., for cost models.
However, it is <i>not</i> fine for code generation!<a href="#footnote42" id="footnote42-back">42</a> This used to be obvious, but recently my
impression is that it's not anymore. For example, recently we got a comment from
one of the reviewers of <a target="_blank" href="https://sbaziotis.com/compilers/dias.html">Dias</a> which
basically asked “can't you just use an LLM?” No! Please allow me to take a
moment to explain why using LLMs for code generation is not (at least currently)
ok at all.
</p>
<p>Here's the question this boils down to: Is it ok if the code generated from the
compiler is correct, say, 99% of the time? We need to clarify this a bit. Does
that mean that out of 100 generated programs, 99 are fully correct and the one
is near-total garbage? Obviously not, this not realistic. A more realistic
version would be something like this: Out of 100 lines of code, the compiler
generates correct code for 99 of them. I know this is still pretty simplistic
but I think it's good enough for this argument. So, is that ok?
</p>
<p>I hope that your answer is no. From a compiler developer's standpoint, this
absolute garbage. Basically such a compiler is unusable. At best, it is some
kind of research artifact that helps you explore an idea. But forget production.
It's not even ok for debugging. To see why, consider a small project with say
5000 lines of code. With 99% correctness rate, this means that in every
compilation, 50 lines of code are incorrect. Fifty! And the worst part is: you
don't know which and they can be different with every code change. You probably
have had the experience of tracking down a bug in a <i>single line</i> of code, which
can be both frustrating and time-consuming. Image how it is debugging 50
changing lines of code! Now, imagine moving this to a large-scale project, with
possibly millions of lines of code.<a href="#footnote43" id="footnote43-back">43</a> No, thanks.
</p>
<p>A final note: Even if LLMs were producing correct code, they are currently
<i>extremely slow</i> compared to compilers. I know, I said compilers are not that
fast in previous sections. But, compared to LLMs, mainstream compilers are
blazingly fast. So, even though LLMs have a promising future, and already a
bright present, there are some things they currently don't solve. One of them is
(online) code generation.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) comprises various diseases of the heart and blood vessels and is currently the leading cause of death and disease burden in Europe, primarily by stroke and ischemic heart disease (<a href="#B1">1</a>, <a href="#B2">2</a>). Despite diet being one of the main modifiable risk factors of many CVDs (<a href="#B2">2</a>), the evidence regarding added sugar intake and CVD risk is scarce and inconclusive (<a href="#B3">3</a>–<a href="#B7">7</a>). Furthermore, most studies have primarily focused on sugar-sweetened beverage consumption rather than overall added sugar intake even though sugar-sweetened beverages make up only ~14% of added sugar intake in Sweden and ~25% in the United States (<a href="#B8">8</a>, <a href="#B9">9</a>).</p>
<p>The guidelines for sugar intake vary between different authoritative bodies globally, both with regards to the recommendation thresholds and the basis of the guidelines, with some being based mainly on micronutrient dilution (i.e., the displacement of nutrient-dense food intake by overconsumption of energy-dense foods poor in nutrients), while others are based mainly on the established risks of caries and overweight (<a href="#B6">6</a>). The Nordic nutrition recommendations recommend limiting added sugar and free sugar (all added sugar as well as naturally occurring sugars in honey, syrups, fruit juices, and fruit juice concentrates) intake to &lt; 10% of energy intake (E%), based on the risk of micronutrient dilution and developing chronic metabolic diseases and dental caries (<a href="#B10">10</a>). The American dietary guidelines have a similar recommendation for added sugar intake based on the risk of micronutrient dilution, overweight and obesity, as well as related chronic metabolic diseases (<a href="#B11">11</a>), and The World Health Organization has a similar recommendation for free sugar intake based on the risk of dental caries and overweight. The World Health Organization also further suggest reducing the intake to below 5 E% for additional benefits for dental health (<a href="#B12">12</a>).</p>
<p>The European Food Safety Authority's (EFSA) scientific opinion on a tolerable upper intake level for dietary sugars published in 2022 (<a href="#B6">6</a>) reported moderate evidence for a dose-response relationship between added and free sugar intake and obesity and dyslipidemia, as well as evidence of high certainty pointing toward associations between intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and CVD incidence. However, no conclusion could be drawn about the associations between added and free sugar intake and CVD risk due to the lack of studies available (<a href="#B6">6</a>).</p>
<p>Most studies on added sugar intake and CVD risk have studied CVD as a composite endpoint, but previous findings of ours indicate that the association between added sugar and CVD incidence varies between different CVDs (<a href="#B13">13</a>), thus highlighting the importance of studying different CVDs separately. Research on the associations between added sugar intake and most individual CVDs such as for example abdominal aortic aneurysm and atrial fibrillation is lacking, and the very few studies that have investigated the associations with for example myocardial infarction or stroke present inconsistent findings (<a href="#B13">13</a>–<a href="#B15">15</a>). In addition to the lack of studies investigating the long-term effects of added sugar intake and the insufficient evidence regarding overall added sugar intake and CVD risk (<a href="#B3">3</a>, <a href="#B16">16</a>), many studies only include a single dietary assessment at baseline, meaning that the assumption has to be made that this single assessment is representative of the participants' diets over time. In this study, diet was assessed at two time-points (in years 1997 and 2009) for the majority of the participants.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was therefore to examine whether there are associations between intake of added sugar, sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, and risk of several types of CVD (i.e., ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, and abdominal aortic aneurysm) among 69,705 participants in two Swedish cohorts, with time-updated data for a majority of the participants in the study. Discerning whether there are associations between added sugar intake and CVD risk could help inform future nutritional recommendations.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<h3>Study population</h3>
<p>The study population consists of female participants from the Swedish Mammography Cohort (SMC) and male participants from the Cohort of Swedish Men (COSM), both of which are population–based prospective cohort studies in Central Sweden and part of the national research infrastructure SIMPLER (Swedish Infrastructure for Medical Population-based Life-course Environmental Research). Invitations were sent by mail to all women born between 1914–1948 living in Uppsala county and Västmanland county, and to all men born between 1918–1952 living in Örebro county and Västmanland county (<a href="#B17">17</a>).</p>
<p>The participants of SMC and COSM completed identical questionnaires (except for some sex-specific questions) regarding diet, health, and lifestyle factors in the years 1987–1990 (SMC only), 1997, 2008, and 2009. Ultimately, 66,651 women participated in SMC in 1987–1990 (74% response rate). During 1997, which serves as the baseline of our study as it was the first assessment that included both cohorts, the response rate was 70% of the still living participants from 1987 in SMC (<i>n</i> = 39,227), and 49% in COSM (<i>n</i> = 48,850) (<a href="#B17">17</a>). The study was approved by The Swedish Ethical Review Authority (dnr: 2019-03986) and completion of the self-administered questionnaire was considered to convey informed consent.</p>
<p>In 2008, all participants of SMC and COSM were sent a health and lifestyle questionnaire, and those who responded received an expanded semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in 2009. In total, 47,918 participants responded to the 2009 questionnaire, and 42,327 participants (19,598 women and 22,729 men) remained after baseline exclusions (61% of participants from 1997) (<a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>).</p>

<h3>Baseline exclusions</h3>
<p>As SMC originally only included women without cancer, participants in both cohorts with cancer recorded in Swedish registers prior to the baseline were excluded from the present study. Further exclusions were made of those with prevalent CVD (identified using national registers), self-reported diabetes at baseline, death prior to January 1<sup>st</sup>, 1998, missing or incorrect ID, and those deemed to have had extreme energy intakes, since it could indicate misreporting. Extreme energy intake was defined as being outside of 3 standard deviations (SDs) below and above the log<sub>e</sub>-transformed mean energy intake, corresponding to below 470 kcal and above 12,790 kcal in COSM and below 263 kcal and above 9,647 kcal in SMC. Thus, 32,934 participants from SMC and 36,771 participants from COSM remained (69,705 participants in total) in 1997. For the assessment in 2009, individuals deemed to have had extreme energy intakes (i.e., outside of 3 SDs below and above the log<sub>e</sub>-transformed mean energy intake, corresponding to below 580 kcal and above 5,687 kcal in SMC and below 787 kcal and above 7,932 kcal in COSM) were excluded, resulting in 19,598 participants in SMC and 22,729 participants in COSM remaining. In total, 42,327 participants responded to the 2009 questionnaire and remained after exclusions (<a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>).</p>
<h3>Dietary assessment</h3>
<p>Dietary information at baseline (in 1997) was obtained using a 96-item validated semi-quantitative FFQ covering average intakes of various foods and beverages during the preceding year. For all food items and for alcohol intake, the participants could choose between 8 or 9 predetermined consumption frequencies, and portion sizes were either specified as standardized portions or self-reported (as was the case for alcohol consumption). The questions regarding frequency of beverage consumption (including sweetened beverages, tea, and coffee) and table sugar and honey intakes were posed as open-ended questions about the number of daily or weekly servings consumed in the preceding year.</p>
<p>In 2009, a 132-item semi-quantitative FFQ was distributed to COSM and SMC participants in order to obtain updated dietary information. The 132-item FFQ included additional foods and was designed to capture the consumption of specific foods and diets that were consumed more frequently in 2009 than in 1997. Nutrient intakes were estimated by multiplying the consumption frequency of each food item with the nutrient content of sex- and age-specific portion sizes obtained from weighed food records in a subgroup of 152 men from COSM and 129 women from SMC. The nutrient values were derived from the Swedish Food Composition Database (<a href="#B18">18</a>). Participants with missing information about individual foods were interpreted as non-consumers.</p>
<p>The 1997 dietary assessment was validated against 14 24-h recall interviews among 248 Swedish men living in central Sweden, randomly selected from the Swedish population register, with a Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.70 being reported for sucrose (<a href="#B19">19</a>). Further, a validation study was carried out among 129 randomly selected women from SMC using four 1-week records that were completed 3–4 months apart. The reported correlation coefficients were 0.6 for sweetened beverages, 0.5 for jams and marmalades, and 0.4 for sweets (A. Wolk, unpublished observations, 1992).</p>
<h4>Added sugar estimation</h4>
<p>The participants' total added sugar intakes were estimated by subtracting their intakes of naturally occurring sugars in fruit, vegetables, fruit juices, and jams from their total intake of sucrose and monosaccharides. The amounts of naturally occurring monosaccharides and sucrose were estimated using the Swedish Food Composition Database (<a href="#B18">18</a>) (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Table S1</a>). The added sugar intakes (g/day) were then converted into percentages of non-alcoholic energy intakes. This added sugar density variable was further categorized into ≤ 5 E%, &gt;5–7.5 E%, &gt;7.5–10 E%, &gt;10–15 E%, &gt;15–20 E%, and &gt;20 E%. The categories were designed to allow a wide range of sugar intakes to be studied, including those commonly used in nutritional recommendations as well as extreme intakes.</p>
<h4>Sugar-sweetened foods and beverages</h4>
<p>As the macronutrient distribution, energy density, and consumption patterns vary between different sources of added sugar, sugar-sweetened foods and beverages were studied in groups of treats (pastries, ice cream, sweets, and chocolate), toppings (table sugar, honey, jams, and marmalades), and sweetened beverages (all sweetened sodas and fruit drinks but not pure fruit juices). Notable differences are that toppings generally have negligible fat and protein contents, whereas treats tend to have a higher fat content, and we additionally hypothesized that treats were more likely to be overconsumed than toppings. As liquid sugar has been suggested to be metabolized differently than solid sugar and to consequently cause different health outcomes (<a href="#B20">20</a>), a category of sweetened beverages was also created. The dietary questionnaire from 1997 asked about overall sweetened beverage intake, while the 2009 questionnaire differentiated between sugar-sweetened beverages and artificially sweetened beverages, which were combined to create the sweetened beverage variable in the 2009 data. Participants with missing information about individual foods were interpreted as non-consumers (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Table S2</a>).</p>
<p>Intake of sweetened beverages was divided into categories of ≤ 1, &gt;1–3, &gt;3–5, &gt;5–8, and &gt;8 servings/week, intake of treats was divided into categories of ≤ 2, &gt;2–5, &gt;5–8, &gt;8–14, and &gt;14 servings/week, and intake of toppings was divided into categories of ≤ 2, &gt;2–7, &gt;7–14, &gt;14–28, and &gt;28 servings/week. The categories for the sugar-sweetened foods and beverages were set based on categories previously used in two other Swedish cohorts carried out around the same period as the baseline of COSM and SMC, and were determined by examining the restricted cubic spline curves of association between added sugar intake and total mortality (<a href="#B21">21</a>, <a href="#B22">22</a>).</p>
<h3>Case ascertainment</h3>
<p>The participants were followed until diagnosis of the studied outcome, death, or the end of the follow-up period (December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2019), whichever occurred first. The participants' Swedish personal identification numbers were used to identify cases of the studied outcomes between 1998 and 2019 in the Swedish National Inpatient Register and the Cause of Death Register, according to the International Classification of Diseases 10 (ICD−10) and corresponding codes in earlier editions. The Swedish National Inpatient Register has been reported to have high diagnostic validity, with positive predictive values of &gt;90% being reported for most of the studied outcomes (<a href="#B23">23</a>). The studied outcomes and their ICD-10 codes were ischemic stroke (I63), myocardial infarction (I21), heart failure (I50 and I11.0), atrial fibrillation (I48), aortic valve stenosis (I35.0 and I35.2), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (I71.3 and I71.4). As it has been indicated that ischemic stroke incidence is affected more by lifestyle factors than hemorrhagic stroke (<a href="#B24">24</a>), ischemic stroke cases and hemorrhagic stroke cases were studied separately, with the variable for hemorrhagic stroke including cases of intracerebral hemorrhage (I61) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (I60).</p>
<h3>Statistical analyses</h3>
<p>All analyses were conducted using R version 4.0.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), with <i>P</i>–values &lt; 0.05 denoting statistical significance. The population baseline characteristics were tested across the added sugar intake categories, with normally distributed continuous variables presented as mean with SD, skewed continuous variables presented as median with interquartile range (IQR), and categorical variables presented as number of participants with proportion of total participants.</p>
<p>Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate the associations between the studied exposures and outcomes using the <i>survival</i> R package (<a href="#B25">25</a>) with the time of follow-up being used as the time variable. Time-updated exposures and covariates were incorporated in the Cox regression for participants who responded to both the 1997 and 2009 questionnaires (<i>n</i> = 42,327). This was done by dividing the follow-up period into two intervals (1997–2009 and 2009–2019), with the 1997 data being used in the first interval and the updated data from 2009 being used in the second interval. For those who only completed the 1997 questionnaires (<i>n</i> = 27,378), the data from 1997 was used in both intervals (<a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>). The <i>P</i>-values for the trends were analyzed using the medians of the exposure categories in the models, using the lowest intake category as a reference.</p>
<p>Associations between added sugar intake and incident disease outcomes were investigated using several different models that were adjusted for factors that are established risk factors for CVDs and are associated with added sugar intake. The first model was adjusted for age (years), sex, and total energy intake (kilocalories/day). The second model was additionally adjusted for lifestyle factors as categorical variables: smoking status [current, former, never, missing (n<sub>1997</sub> = 1,086, n<sub>2009</sub> = 1,218)], educational level [less than high school, high school, university, missing (n<sub>1997</sub> = 279, n<sub>2009</sub> = 88)], alcohol consumption (non-consumers and quintiles of sex-specific intakes), as well as walking/cycling [almost never, &lt; 20 min/day, 20–40 min/day, 40–60 min/day, 1–1.5 h/day, &gt;1.5 h/day, missing (n<sub>1997</sub> = 6,084, n<sub>2009</sub> = 676)], and exercise (type of exercise not specified) [ &lt; 1 h/week, 1–2 h/week, 3–4 h/week or ≥5 h/week, missing (n<sub>1997</sub> = 7,385, n<sub>2009</sub> = 917)]. The smoking variable was modified so that all participants who indicated years since they stopped smoking were recorded as former smokers. The main model was additionally adjusted for body mass index (BMI) (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and dietary factors, including consumption of processed meat (g/day), coffee (g/day), as well as energy adjusted saturated fatty acid and fiber intakes (using the nutrient residual model). The proportional hazards assumptions were tested using Schoenfeld residuals, and the models were stratified for age, sex, and walking/cycling to attain proportionality. Missing values were included as a separate category for each of the categorical variables, while missing values for continuous dietary covariates were interpreted as zero-consumption. Non-linear trends of CVDs were assessed using restricted cubic splines and the rms R package with 5 knots placed at the 5<sup>th</sup>, 27.5<sup>th</sup>, 50<sup>th</sup>, 72.5<sup>th</sup>, and 95<sup>th</sup> percentiles of added sugar intake with 10 E% as reference (<a href="#B26">26</a>).</p>
<h4>Sensitivity analyses</h4>
<p>Interactions between sex and added sugar intake, as well as BMI and added sugar intake, were studied by adding them as continuous interaction terms in the main model for each of the outcomes. For the associations with statistically significant interactions, stratified analyses were conducted.</p>
<p>Since the 1997 questionnaire only asked about overall sweetened beverage intake (i.e., sugar-sweetened beverages and artificially sweetened beverages combined), dietary data from 2009 was used to study consumption of artificially sweetened beverages and sugar-sweetened beverages separately, using 2009 as a baseline, among participants who responded to the 2009 questionnaire (<i>n</i> = 42,327).</p>
<p>Comorbidities are prevalent with many CVDs (<a href="#B27">27</a>, <a href="#B28">28</a>). To take comorbidity into consideration, a sensitivity analysis was conducted in which all participants with incidence of any of the other studied CVDs prior to incidence of the outcome of interest were excluded from the analysis.</p>
<p>As there are several different methods for energy adjustment in epidemiological studies (<a href="#B29">29</a>), sensitivity analyses were conducted using additional energy-adjustment methods. For added sugar, the residual method were used in addition to the nutrient density method (as used in the main analyses) (<a href="#B29">29</a>). For sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, the nutrient density method and the residual method were used in addition to the standard multivariate method (as used in the main analyses). The energy-adjusted intakes using the nutrient density method and the residual method were standardized to the study population's mean energy intake.</p>
<p>To evaluate how the addition of the 2009 diet assessment affected the risk estimates in the main analyses for added sugar intake, a sensitivity analysis using only the 1997 baseline dietary data was conducted.</p>
<p>Further, to reduce bias by reverse causality, a sensitivity analysis was conducted where we excluded cases of the studied outcome that occurred within the first 3 years of the follow-up period.</p>
<p>Finally, to investigate how including missing data may have affected the results for added sugar, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which only participants with complete data for all sugar-sweetened foods and beverages and categorical covariates were included. Similarly, we conducted sensitivity analyses for treats, toppings, and sweetened beverage intake, including only participants with complete data for the respective variables and categorical covariates.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>Study population characteristics</h3>
<p>The study population consisted of 69,705 participants (47.2% female), with a mean BMI of 25.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, mean age of 59.9 years (ranging between 45 and 83 years) and mean added sugar intake of 9.1 E% at baseline (<a href="#T1">Table 1</a>). Higher added sugar consumers tended to be male, with higher exercise levels and with lower education levels than lower added sugar consumers. Furthermore, those consuming high amounts of added sugar were generally older, had higher energy intakes, and had higher intakes of toppings and sweetened beverages. The intake of treats was more evenly distributed across the added sugar intake groups than the other sugar-sweetened foods and beverages (<a href="#T2">Table 2</a>).</p>

<p><b>Table 2</b>. Baseline characteristics of the study population according to the added sugar intake categories.</p></div>


<h3>Added sugar intake and CVD risk</h3>
<p>During the follow-up period, 25,739 participants were diagnosed with at least one CVD, including 6,912 cases of ischemic stroke, 1,664 cases of hemorrhagic stroke, 6,635 cases of myocardial infarction, 10,090 cases of heart failure, 1,872 cases of aortic stenosis, 13,167 cases of atrial fibrillation, and 1,575 cases of abdominal aortic aneurysm. The associations between the added sugar intake and the studied outcomes were generally stronger in the first model (adjusted for age, sex, and total energy intake), but attenuated in the second model (additionally adjusted for lifestyle factors), and further attenuated in the main model (additionally adjusted for lifestyle factors, BMI, and dietary factors) (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary</a> <a href="#SM1">Tables S3</a>–<a href="#SM1">S9</a>).</p>
<p>Indications of positive linear associations (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> &lt; 0.01) were found between added sugar intake and risk of ischemic stroke and abdominal aortic aneurysm in the main model. For abdominal aortic aneurysm, a 31% (95% CI: 5–65%) higher risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm was found for added sugar intakes of &gt;20E%, and for ischemic stroke, a 9% (95% CI: 0–19%) higher risk was found for intakes of &gt;15–20 E%, compared to the lowest intake category of ≤ 5 E%. For a majority of the outcomes, however, the highest risks were found in the lowest intake category, whereas the lowest risks were found for low- to moderate intakes. Compared to the lowest intake category ( ≤ 5 E%), added sugar intake of &gt;5–7.5 E% was linked with statistically significant lower risks of ischemic stroke [8% (95% CI: 2-13%)], myocardial infarction [5% (95% CI: 0–11%)], heart failure [9% (95% CI: 5–13%)], aortic stenosis [9% (95% CI: 0–18%)], and atrial fibrillation [7% (95% CI: 3–11%)]. Furthermore, compared to added sugar intakes ≤ 5 E%, lower risks of heart failure and atrial fibrillation were found for intakes of &gt;7.5–10 E% [6% (95% CI: 1–10%), and 4% (95% CI: 0–8%), respectively], as well as of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis for intakes of &gt;10–15 E% [5% (95% CI: 0–10%), 4% (95% CI: 0–8%), and 17% (95% CI: 7–26%), respectively]. No associations were found between added sugar intake and hemorrhagic stroke risk (<a href="#F2">Figure 2</a>, <a href="#T3">Table 3</a>).</p>

<h3>Sugar-sweetened foods and beverages and CVDs</h3>
<p>For sweetened beverages, positive linear associations were found for ischemic stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and abdominal aortic aneurysm (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> &lt; 0.001). Intake of &gt;8 servings per week of sweetened beverages was associated with a 19% (95% CI: 11–27%) higher risk of ischemic stroke, an 18% (95% CI: 11–24%) higher risk of heart failure, an 11% (95% CI: 6–17%) higher risk of atrial fibrillation, and a 31% (95% CI: 15–50%) higher risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Tables S3</a>–<a href="#SM1">S9</a>).</p>
<p>For treats, negative linear associations were found with all outcomes (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> &lt; 0.01), with the highest risks being found among consumers of ≤ 2 servings/week (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Tables S3</a>–<a href="#SM1">S9</a>).</p>
<p>For toppings, negative linear associations were found with heart failure, and aortic stenosis, while a positive linear association was found with abdominal aortic aneurysm (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> &lt; 0.01). Specifically, ~10% lower risks of heart failure were found for all intake categories compared to the lowest intake category ( ≤ 2 servings/week). A 34% (95% CI: 18–51%) higher risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm was found for the highest intake category of toppings (&gt;28 servings/week) compared to the lowest intake category. For aortic stenosis, 16% (95% CI: 5–25%), 20% (95% CI: 9–29%), and 15% (95% CI: 3–25%) lower risks were found for toppings intakes of &gt;7–14, &gt;14–28, and &gt;28 servings/week, respectively, compared to the lowest intake category (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Tables S3</a>–<a href="#SM1">S9</a>).</p>
<h3>Sensitivity analyses</h3>
<p>No interactions were found between sex and added sugar intake for the studied outcomes (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05). Interactions were found between added sugar intake and BMI for atrial fibrillation and heart failure (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Higher added sugar intake was associated with higher risks of abdominal aortic aneurysm and ischemic stroke in individuals with BMI &gt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, while higher added sugar intake was associated with a higher risk of heart failure in individuals with BMI 18.5–25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Tables S10</a>, <a href="#SM1">S11</a>, <a href="#F3">Figure 3</a>).</p>

<p>The associations for sugar-sweetened beverage and artificially sweetened beverage intake were studied separately among the 42,327 participants who had answered the 2009 dietary assessment. Among these participants, 10,843 individuals reported consumption of at least 1 serving/week of sugar-sweetened beverages, and 5,727 participants reported consumption of at least 1 serving/week of artificially sweetened beverages. Positive linear associations were observed between intake of artificially sweetened beverages and risk of ischemic stroke (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> &lt; 0.01) and heart failure (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> &lt; 0.01) (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Table S12</a>), while intake of sugar-sweetened beverages was not associated with CVD risk (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Table S13</a>).</p>
<p>To take comorbidity into consideration, all participants with prior incidence of the other studied CVDs during the follow-up period were excluded for each studied outcome. This resulted in slightly attenuated associations between added sugar intake and most of the studied outcomes; however, the tendencies and directions of the previously linear associations remained, as positive linear associations were observed for ischemic stroke (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> = 0.05) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> &lt; 0.01), while a negative linear association was observed between added sugar intake and incident aortic stenosis (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> = 0.04) (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Table S14</a>).</p>
<p>The risk estimates did not differ notably when testing the associations for added sugar and sugar-sweetened food and beverage intake with energy adjustments using the nutrient density method or the residual method for added sugar intake, nor between the standard multivariate method, nutrient density method, or residual method for sugar-sweetened foods and beverages (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Tables S15</a>–<a href="#SM1">S18</a>).</p>
<p>When studying the associations between added sugar and CVD incidence using the 1997 dietary data only, the results were similar to the main results but with lower precision (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Table S19</a>). Similarly, excluding cases of the studied outcomes within the first 3 years of the follow-up period did not alter the results (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Table S20</a>).</p>
<p>When only including the participants with complete data for sugar-sweetened foods and beverages and categorical covariates, the overall results remained similar to the main analyses (<a href="#SM1">Supplementary Tables S21</a>–<a href="#SM1">S24</a>).</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The findings of this study on the associations between added sugar and CVD risk indicate that the associations vary depending on the disease and the source of added sugar, demonstrating the importance of studying them separately. There were statistically significant linear associations between total added sugar intake and ischemic stroke and abdominal aortic aneurysm, but the highest risk of most of the studied outcomes were found in the lowest intake category. High intake of sweetened beverages was associated with higher risk for most of the studied outcomes, for which positive linear associations were found. In contrast, a low intake of treats was associated with a higher risk of all the studied outcomes. Incorporating the time-updated 2009 information in the analyses resulted in higher precision of the results.</p>
<p>Very few studies have investigated the associations between added sugar intake and incidence of specific CVDs, and this study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first one to investigate the associations with many of the studied outcomes such as for example abdominal aortic aneurysm and atrial fibrillation. Results from the Women's Health Initiative did not show associations between added sugar intake and incident heart failure nor stroke (<a href="#B14">14</a>). In the Swedish Malmö Diet and Cancer Study, the associations for sugar intake also varied depending on CVD disease and source of added sugar (<a href="#B13">13</a>, <a href="#B21">21</a>). In that study, U-shaped associations were found between added sugar intake and overall stroke risk (<a href="#B13">13</a>). In a study of UK biobank participants, free sugar intake was linearly associated with overall stroke risk (<a href="#B15">15</a>). In the current cohort we divided stroke into subtypes and found a positive linear association with ischemic stroke (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub> &lt; 0.01) but no associations with hemorrhagic stroke. The non-linear associations between added sugar intake and atrial fibrillation and aortic stenosis were comparable between the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study and this study, with the highest relative risk found in the lowest intake category for both outcomes.</p>
<p>Although mechanisms explaining the associations between added sugar intake and CVD risk are not well-established, several biological mechanisms have been proposed. One hypothesis is based on the distinct metabolism of fructose, a component of the common added sugar sucrose. Fructose is metabolized in the liver and converted to glycerol-3-phosphate, which serves as a backbone for triacylglycerol synthesis, leading to increased triacylglycerol synthesis and ultimately increased CVD risk (<a href="#B20">20</a>, <a href="#B30">30</a>). It is important to highlight that the notion of adverse metabolic effects of fructose has been questioned, as many studies on the topic refer to very high intakes of fructose (&gt;95th percentile) which do not reflect the metabolic effects of normal dietary intakes (<a href="#B31">31</a>, <a href="#B32">32</a>). The EFSA scientific opinion on a tolerable upper intake level for dietary sugars does however state that evidence from prospective cohort studies suggest positive and causal relationship between the intake of fructose and risk of cardiovascular diseases, albeit with a low level of certainty (<a href="#B6">6</a>).</p>
<p>Relationships between added sugar intake and CVD risk factors such as dyslipidaemia (<a href="#B5">5</a>, <a href="#B6">6</a>), hypertension (<a href="#B6">6</a>), and obesity, have been shown in both randomized controlled trials and observational studies, and could help explain the associations found between added sugar intake and some of the studied CVDs. Although the mentioned CVD risk factors affect all of the studied CVDs to some extent, one explanation for the findings for the different CVDs may be that the risk factors affect the diseases to varying degrees. For example, aortic stenosis can be caused by congenital heart defects and hemorrhagic stroke can be caused by head injuries, whereas ischemic stroke and abdominal aortic aneurysm might be more dependent on atherosclerotic processes. This could result in the potential effect of dietary factors on disease incidence being smaller and more difficult to discern for some of the studied outcomes. This would however not explain the lack of associations found with for example myocardial infarction, as it is also a highly atherosclerotic disease. Consequently, more research is needed to gain deeper understanding of the possible associations and mechanisms of added sugar intake and CVD risk.</p>
<p>The results for the associations between added sugar and some CVDs in individuals with overweight and obesity in this study suggest that BMI may be an effect modifier of the associations, which could explain some of the discrepancies between studies as the rates of overweight or obesity vary in different populations. The role of BMI as a potential effect modifier of the associations between added sugar intake and CVD risk consequently warrants further investigation. Further, although consumption of &lt; 5 E% of added sugar was associated with a higher risk of several CVDs, it is important to highlight that there are no well-established biological mechanistic explanations for these associations. Findings from the Australian Health Survey 2011–2012 (weighted <i>n</i> = 6,150) did however indicate that added sugar intakes below 5 E% were associated with lower micronutrient intakes (<a href="#B33">33</a>), and it is also possible that the added sugar is substituted by other nutrients such as for example saturated fats. Both of these factors could contribute to adverse cardiovascular health. On the other hand, results from two Swedish populations (<i>n</i> = 12,238 and <i>n</i> = 1,797) indicated an inverse association between added sugar intake and micronutrient intake, contradicting the micronutrient dilution theory (<a href="#B34">34</a>). Finally, methodological limitations such as residual confounding and misreporting could affect the results and explain some of the findings. The overall findings based on CVD health do not support lowering the recommendations for added sugar intake to below 5 E%, although they do indicate lower risks of CVDs among consumers of &gt;5–7.5 E% than among consumers of 10 E% of added sugar.</p>
<p>The clear associations between overall sweetened beverage intake and a higher risk of several CVDs (i.e., ischemic stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and abdominal aortic aneurysm) found in this study are supported by previous findings. However, the findings specifically for artificially sweetened beverages and sugar-sweetened beverages are not as congruous with existing literature which points toward them being associated with CVD risk as well as risk markers for CVD (<a href="#B6">6</a>, <a href="#B35">35</a>–<a href="#B37">37</a>). In this study, however, higher intake of artificially sweetened beverages was associated with increased risks of ischemic stroke and heart failure, while no associations were found between intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and CVD risk. This could be explained by a relatively low frequency of sugar- and artificially sweetened beverage consumption, as 10,843 (26%) and 5,727 (14%) individuals, respectively, reported consumption of at least 1 serving/week. Only 2,499 (6%) individuals consumed &gt;8 servings/week of sugar-sweetened beverages and 1,660 (4%) individuals consumed &gt;8 servings/week of artificially sweetened beverages. To put it into perspective, a review article reported an 8% increased CVD risk with each additional consumed serving of sugar-sweetened beverages per day (<a href="#B38">38</a>), thus it is possible that there were too few sugar- and artificially sweetened beverage consumers, and in particular, too few high-frequency consumers, to detect similar associations. It should also be mentioned, however, that it has been suggested that associations found with artificially sweetened beverages could be affected by reverse causality (<a href="#B36">36</a>). It should also be noted that while some literature suggests that consumption of artificial sweeteners could impact cardiovascular health negatively by alteration of the gut microbiota, the collected body of evidence does not indicate adverse effects of artificially sweetened beverage intake on CVD risk (<a href="#B39">39</a>).</p>
<p>The findings for treats are consistent with previous findings in the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study, in which the highest risks of stroke, coronary events, atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis were found in the lowest intake category ( ≤ 2 servings/week) (<a href="#B13">13</a>). Similar findings were reported for all-cause mortality in the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study and the Northern Swedish Health and Disease Study, where inverse associations were reported with intake of treats (<a href="#B21">21</a>). The findings for toppings are less uniform, as the results from this study indicated positive associations between intake of toppings and risk of heart failure and aortic stenosis, and negatively associated with risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm, while no associations were found with intake of toppings and CVD risk in Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (<a href="#B13">13</a>). Given that this study has more than twice as many participants as the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study, it is possible that the discrepancy could be due to a higher power to detect associations.</p>
<p>The findings of this study indicate that not all sources of added sugar are equally harmful to health, as sugar-sweetened beverages are the primary source of added sugar associated with increased CVD risk. Possible explanations of the discrepancies between the associations for sweetened beverages and treats and toppings include liquid calories providing lower satiety and insufficient compensatory reduction of caloric intake, thus promoting overweight and obesity, which are established risk factors for CVD (<a href="#B40">40</a>). It should be noted that there are currently no mechanistic explanations for the negative linear associations found for treats. One aspect to take into consideration is however that there is a social tradition of “fika” in Sweden, where people get together with friends, relatives, or coworkers for coffee and pastries (<a href="#B41">41</a>). Thus, one could hypothesize that the intake of treats is part of many people's everyday lives without necessarily being related with overall poor dietary or lifestyle patterns, and that it might be a marker of social life. Consumption of sweetened beverages, one the other hand, has been linked to lower overall dietary quality (<a href="#B42">42</a>).</p>
<p>Despite adjusting for plausible confounders, we cannot rule out the presence of confounders due to the observational nature of this study and the complexity of diet as an exposure. The confounders are also likely to differ between the outcomes. In this study, while adjustments were made for processed meat consumption, a significant contributor to sodium intake in Sweden, direct sodium intake was not accounted for. The FFQ used in the cohorts did not account for salt used in cooking or at the table, and therefore, dietary sodium intake could not be estimated. Moreover, existing literature indicates poor agreement between sodium intake estimated from FFQs and urinary sodium excretion (<a href="#B43">43</a>), highlighting the need for future research to incorporate more accurate measures, such as urinary sodium excretion, to more precisely assess the impact of sodium intake as a potential confounding factor. Further, we did not adjust for factors accounting for social networks, which is something that should be further explored in future studies. As inverse associations have been found between intake of treats and CVD incidence in these cohorts as well as others (<a href="#B21">21</a>), intake of treats should be studied closer with regards to biological mechanisms as well as possible correlations with other factors that could impact the observed associations. Other limitations of this study include the self-reported dietary information, which may introduce some misreporting and, as a result, misclassification of exposure. Although we excluded individuals deemed to have implausible energy intakes, some misclassification of exposure may remain. Additionally, approximately 39% of the participants did not complete the 2009 assessment, meaning that information on diet and covariates was only available during baseline for those participants.</p>
<p>In comparison to the national mean added sugar intake of 9.6 E% in Sweden in 2010–2011 (<a href="#B8">8</a>), the mean added sugar intakes in the study population were lower, estimated to be 9.0 E% in 1997 and 6.7 E% in 2009. In this study population, the intakes of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages were also lower in 2009 than in 1997, despite the national intake levels of sweetened beverages and treats increasing throughout the same period (<a href="#B44">44</a>). Aside from an actual difference in sugar intake between 1997 and 2009 in SMC and COSM, one possible explanation for this difference is that the general perception of the health effects of added sugar differed during those time periods, and thus it could be theorized that misreporting of added sugar was more prevalent in 2009 than in 1997. Despite this, the precision of the results was higher when incorporating the updated information from 2009.</p>
<p>Strengths of this study include the large study population of 69,705 individuals as well as the repeated assessments for the majority of the participants, which allowed us to gain insights into the participants' diets at two separate time-points, leading to higher precision and likely reducing misclassification of exposure, though this cannot be completely ruled out. Finally, because the associations between added sugar intake and different CVD outcomes can vary, this study investigated the risk of the CVDs separately. We also studied added sugar intake as a whole and in groups of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, providing higher granularity and further insights into how different forms of added sugar intake associate with CVD risk. Due to the large number of statistical tests performed in this study, there is a risk of chance findings. The findings of this study could help inform future dietary guidelines and recommendations which could guide policies to reduce CVD incidence and ultimately improve public health.</p>
<p>The results of this study are consistent with previous findings in another Swedish middle-aged population (<a href="#B13">13</a>), but the associations between added sugar intake and CVD risk cannot necessarily be generalized to other populations as the consumption patterns of added sugar and sugar-sweetened foods and beverages may vary across countries and age groups. More research is needed to discern whether the observed associations, and the findings for treats in particular, can be replicated in other populations, and future research should be conducted to explore potential mechanisms and associations with intermediary risk factors. To acquire a better understanding of the associations between added sugar intake and CVD risk, other methods such as using objective biomarkers or Mendelian randomizations could be used to investigate any causal links between added sugar intake and CVD risk in observational studies.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>According to the findings of this study, the associations between added sugar intake and CVDs vary substantially depending on the disease and source of added sugar. Finally, the findings of this study emphasize the adverse health effects associated with sweetened beverage consumption and indicate higher CVD risks among individuals with low intakes of treats.</p>
