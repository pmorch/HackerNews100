You can even use the same TV for 4K 120 Hz gaming or watching movies as a bonus!</blockquote><p>For programming, word processing, and other productive work, consider getting an 8K TV instead of a multi-monitor setup.
An 8K TV will have superior image quality, resolution, and versatility compared to multiple 4K displays, at roughly the same size.
As a bonus, an 8K display is also suitable for gaming at 4K 120 Hz, or for full screen media consumption, which is not possible with multiple smaller monitors.</p><p>Currently 8K TVs are found in 55” and above. 
This is about the same width as getting two 27” monitors or two 32” monitors, both common setups for programmers and other professionals.
This is also the same physical width as ultrawide screens, but with a superior resolution of 7680 px wide instead of the common upper limit of 5120 px for ultrawide screens.</p><h2 id="s1"><a href="#s1">1</a> <span>Pros of using an 8K display</span></h2><h2 id="s1.1"><a href="#s1.1">1.1</a> <span>For programming, word processing, etc</span></h2><div><figure id="fig2"><a href="https://i.dllu.net/20190723_150428_481a0539480051a8.jpg"><img src="https://i.dllu.net/20190723_150428_1200_ec928294ca540ab6.jpg" alt="Three 27" 4k="" monitors="" "=""></a><figcaption><a href="#fig2">FIGURE 2</a> Three 27” 4K monitors. An 8K monitor would have similar pixel density but no bezels in between.</figcaption></figure></div><div><figure id="fig3"><a href="https://i.dllu.net/IMG_5245_9d3a5a9f8684b2d6.jpg"><img src="https://i.dllu.net/IMG_5245_1200_92ce89a0232d6c7c.jpg" alt=""></a><figcaption><a href="#fig3">FIGURE 3</a> Some random code displayed on an 8K display. Having seven evenly-spaced columns would be impossible on a dual 4K display setup due to bezels in the middle.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Many programmers use a multi-monitor setup, often with multiple 4K monitors.
The bezels and gaps in between the monitors introduce distractions and one is limited in how one may arrange terminals and windows across multiple displays.
With a single 8K display there is no such problem.</p><p>Consider using a tiling window manager to arrange your windows in a large display.
Tiling window managers exist for all operating systems. Here are some examples that I enjoy:</p><ul><li>For Linux: <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a>, <a href="https://swaywm.org/">Sway</a>. Note that although Nvidia was previously hostile to Wayland and Sway, it now works as of 2023. There are a lot more others.</li><li>For MacOS: <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai">Yabai</a></li></ul><p>Productivity is highly sensitive to the display of text.
For this reason, many programmers prefer to use Apple products for their retina displays.
An 8K display will have vastly superior text rendering compared to a single large 4K display, and equivalent text rendering to multiple smaller 4K displays.</p><p>TVs may have a different subpixel layout than monitors, so small text may suffer fringing.
As of writing the Samsung VA and LG IPS panels such as the QN800A have a conventional RGB or BGR subpixel structure. One may also increase the font size or use hidpi scaling which will eliminate all pixel-level concerns.</p><h2 id="s1.2"><a href="#s1.2">1.2</a> <span>For photo and video editing</span></h2><p>Although the main motivation for getting the 8K display was for programming, it is quite nice for photography too.
Apart from the obvious advantage of being able to see a large photo with a sharp resolution, having a high resolution display allows toolbars and such to be legible at a much smaller size relative to the size of the display.
This improves productivity for photo editing. Of course, appropriate hidpi settings may be used to increase the size of toolbars if desired.</p><p>An 8K TV often supports the D65-P3 colour gamut, making it appropriate for photo and video editing.
It may not arrive as well-calibrated as professional monitors out of the box, but it should be possible to calibrate any screen with a display calibrator.
However, extremely colour-sensitive work should still use professional calibrated displays suited for that purpose.</p><h2 id="s1.3"><a href="#s1.3">1.3</a> <span>For CAD work</span></h2><p>CAD work is highly dependent on visualizing fine details.
In particular, a wireframe rendering may become unintelligible if it is of insufficient resolution.
A high resolution display will allow fine details to be seen even while viewing multiple viewports without having to maximize the viewport.
However the viewport may be maximized to occupy the full screen nonetheless, a great advantage compared to multi-monitor setups.</p><h2 id="s1.4"><a href="#s1.4">1.4</a> <span>For gaming/media</span></h2><p>Although this post is mostly focused on productivity, most if not all 8K TVs can be run in 4K at 120 Hz.
Modern TVs have decent input lag in the ballpark of 10 ms and may support FreeSync.
So these are excellent for gaming on the big screen when one needs to take a break from work.
Of course, this may not suffice for competitive professional FPS twitch shooters, but it is pretty darn good.
Multi monitor productivity setups using 4k 60 Hz monitors simply cannot achieve this.</p><p>An 8K TV will also natively support 1440p gaming and media at an exact integer ratio of 3:1 without scaling artifacts that a 4K display would introduce. Perfect for playing the latest titles that your GPU isn’t fast enough to run in 4K.</p><p>Please bear in mind that most GPUs will not run games performantly in 8K and there are basically no 8K movies.</p><p>For watching movies, I set my TV to 4K 120 Hz mode as well.

This has led to some review comments such as quote a <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/samsung-55-class-qn700b-neo-qled-8k-smart-tv/6517114">Best Buy review comment</a>,</p><blockquote>This is not a true HDR 8K TV.
To be HDR 8K, each pixel should have the full range of brightness and dimness to comprise an image. But each pixel only seems to have half the number of steps between full dim and full bright.
So to generate certain shades and colors between full bright and black, the pixels require 2 pixels, one that is brighter and one that is dimmer where the average between the pixels is the correct shade, color or value.
For most shades and colors, this alternating pixel technique forms a diagonal patchwork that has a noticeable checkerboard effect. Images viewed up close look bad.
This isn’t noticeable with windows that are pure white and the text is black, as black text on a white background looks good and is true 8k pixel density with no grid pattern and clean edges on the text.  
[…]
My best guess of what this display is doing is… instead of 8K number of pixels each capable of displaying a full range HDR10 1024 color steps per RGB element, they have two sets of pixels each set only capable of displaying 512 steps of information with every other pixel offset in capability by half a step. They combine the two simpler pixel values to achieve the more complex shades in between.
I can hear the Samsung display engineers, “Who would sit that close anyway to be able to see that?” Well, clearly people who want to use it as a computer monitor would.
The 700B is advertised as not just an HDR screen but an HDR10+ plus screen which is 10bit, but this does not seem to be the case as a non HDR image from my computer still requires dithering to achieve the commanded colors and shades.
No other display makers are making a true 8K display at this size at this price point, so I’m going to keep it and just sit further back so I don’t notice the dithering.</blockquote><div><figure id="fig7"><a href="https://i.dllu.net/2024-07-02-10-15-24_DSCF9108_ee0275f38e0c35fe126fbdfd0ccf2b7d3f32ae47_0aac8cf0ffd2700e.jpg"><img src="https://i.dllu.net/2024-07-02-10-15-24_DSCF9108_ee0275f38e0c35fe126fbdfd0ccf2b7d3f32ae47_1a3a0a203c4597ec.jpg" alt=""></a><figcaption><a href="#fig7">FIGURE 7</a> Checkerboard effect.</figcaption></figure></div><p>This does not affect most text rendering, but I have noticed this effect when editing photos.</p><div><figure id="fig8"><a href="https://i.dllu.net/2024-07-02-10-19-06_DSCF9109_4bf015a151e2719a582bf8ad22c1d9da40e291cf_d6e0350e46252b97.jpg"><img src="https://i.dllu.net/2024-07-02-10-19-06_DSCF9109_4bf015a151e2719a582bf8ad22c1d9da40e291cf_be63f7a46e4a6cc2.jpg" alt=""></a><figcaption><a href="#fig8">FIGURE 8</a> Doesn’t typically affect text rendering significantly.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Again, the problem is completely gone once you enable Game Mode on the TV, so be sure to enable it!</p><h2 id="s2.3"><a href="#s2.3">2.3</a> <span>Random software issues</span></h2><p>Since TVs are rarely designed for PC usage as a first class citizen, there may be some weird quirks or bugs.</p><h3 id="s2.3.1"><a href="#s2.3.1">2.3.1</a> <span>Nvidia Linux drivers</span></h3><p>If using Nvidia on Linux, to get 8K 60 Hz working, you need driver <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/NVIDIA-535.43.02-Linux-Driver">version 535</a> or later on Linux, which was released in May 2023.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><em>"Your embeddings are out of sync again."</em></p><p>It's a message that haunts engineering teams trying to build AI applications. What starts as a simple vector search implementation inevitably evolves into a complex orchestra of monitoring, synchronization, and firefighting.</p><p>We've spent the past year talking to dozens of engineering teams building AI systems with vector databases, whether semantic search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, or AI agents. We learned that while everything works smoothly for simple applications and PoCs, taking these AI systems into production reveals flawed abstractions with vector databases and the way we use them today.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s one common thread we heard:</p><p><em>"You're building a RAG system, and your team uses Pinecone as a vector database to store and search embeddings. But you can't just use Pinecone—your text data doesn't fit well into Pinecone's metadata, so you're also using DynamoDB to handle those blobs and application data. And for lexical search, you needed OpenSearch. Now you're juggling three systems, and syncing them is a nightmare."</em></p><p>It’s easy to see why. Say you delete a source document in your database because it's outdated. Now you have to:</p><ol><li>Fire up boto3 to remove the record from DynamoDB.</li><li>Remember to update Pinecone to ensure the embedding is deleted.</li><li>Need a POST request to update the lexical search index.</li></ol><p>And you need to do this for every update, addition, or delete to your source documents!</p><p>Managing these configurations isn’t just messy—it’s risky. One missed step, and you're stuck paying for an index you haven’t used in months. One team recently shared how they ended up paying $2,000 a month for an index that should've been deleted four months ago! And that’s not even mentioning the risk of returning incorrect or stale data to your users.</p><p>Sounds familiar? After hearing this pattern repeatedly, we realized something crucial:</p><p><strong>Vector databases are built on the wrong abstraction.</strong></p><p>Vector databases treat embeddings as independent data, divorced from the source data from which embeddings are created, rather than what they truly are: derived data. By treating embeddings as independent data, we’ve created unnecessary complexity for ourselves.</p><p>In this post, we'll propose a better way: treating embeddings more like database indexes through what we call the <strong>"vectorizer"</strong> abstraction. This approach automatically keeps embeddings in sync with their source data, eliminating the maintenance costs that plague current implementations.&nbsp;</p><p>A vectorizer’s equivalent of the <code>CREATE INDEX</code> command is:</p><pre><code>-- Create a vectorizer to embed data in the blogs table
-- Use Open AI text-embedding-3-small model
SELECT ai.create_vectorizer(
    'public.blogs'::regclass,
    embedding =&gt; ai.embedding_openai('text-embedding-3-small', 1536),
    chunking =&gt; ai.chunking_recursive_character_text_splitter('content')
);</code></pre><p>This one command will create embeddings for every entry in the blog table and keep updating those embeddings as you change the data in the blog table. In the immortal words of Ina Garten: how easy is that!&nbsp;</p><p>We’ll detail how we implemented this vectorizer abstraction in PostgreSQL in a new open-source tool called <a href="https://github.com/timescale/pgai/blob/main/docs/vectorizer.md?ref=timescale.com"><u>pgai Vectorizer</u></a>, making it work with the open-source <a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/blob/master/README.md?ref=timescale.com"><u>pgvector</u></a> and <a href="https://github.com/timescale/pgvectorscale/?ref=timescale.com"><u>pgvectorscale</u></a> extensions for vector search.&nbsp;</p><p>We built a vectorizer for PostgreSQL because many developers regard PostgreSQL as the “Swiss army knife” of databases, as it can handle everything from vectors and text data to JSON documents. We think an “everything database” like PostgreSQL is the solution to eliminate the nightmare of managing multiple databases, making it the ideal home for vectorizers and the foundation for AI applications.</p><p>If you've ever cursed at stale embeddings or questioned why managing vector search feels needlessly complex, this post is for you.</p><h2 id="the-problem-with-vector-databases-and-vector-data-types">The Problem With Vector Databases (and Vector Data Types)</h2><p>Vector databases were developed as specialized systems to handle large volumes of vector embeddings for text, image, and multi-modal data. And, as the utility of vector embeddings became clearer, many general-purpose databases, like PostgreSQL (with pgvector), MySQL, MongoDB, and even Oracle, added vector search support to their general-purpose offerings either officially or via extensions.</p><p>However, the abstraction of vector search capabilities, either in a standalone system or added to an existing database, suffers from a fatal flaw: once embeddings are inserted into the database, <strong>we lose the connection between the unstructured data that is being embedded and the vector embeddings themselves</strong>.</p><p>Without this connection, embeddings are mistakenly treated as standalone data atoms that developers must manage rather than what they truly are: <strong>derived data</strong>. After all, <a href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-vector-embeddings/"><u>vector embeddings are high-dimensional representations of their source data</u></a>, whether the source data be text, images, or something else. There is a fundamental connection between the vector embedding and the source data it is generated from.</p><p>When we reconceptualize embeddings as derived data, the absurdity of the current vector database abstraction becomes evident, with embeddings disconnected from their source data. To handle the demands of a production AI system, even the best teams find themselves juggling multiple databases and managing the following:</p><ul><li>Complex ETL (extract-load-transform) pipelines to chunk, format, and create embeddings from source data</li><li>A vector database for embeddings, another database for metadata and app data, and perhaps even a separate lexical search index</li><li>A data sync service to synchronize across various databases to avoid conflicting sources of truth</li><li>Queuing systems for updates and synchronization</li><li>Monitoring tools to catch data drift and deal with rate limits and other errors from the embedding service</li><li>Alert systems for when searches return stale results</li><li>Validation checks across all these systems</li></ul><p>And what if you want to upgrade to a newer embedding model or try a different chunking method? Now you're writing custom code and coordinating changes across multiple data services and databases. For example, we’ve heard teams who’ve put off migrating from OpenAI’s <code>text-embedding-ada-002</code> to the newer text-embedding-3 model family for this very reason.</p><p>These tasks place the burden on the development team to ensure that the embeddings are timeously created as source data changes. Otherwise, they risk embeddings frequently becoming stale, leading to a worse application experience for users.</p><p>Thus, even in the best case, teams spend countless hours writing and debugging synchronization logic, setting up infrastructure to handle embedding updates at scale, and firefighting when these systems inevitably break down.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="a-better-way-let-the-database-handle-the-complexity">A Better Way: Let the Database Handle the Complexity&nbsp;</h2><p>When we reconceptualize embeddings as derived data, the <strong>responsibility for generating and updating them as the underlying data changes can be handed over to the database management system</strong>. This change frees developers from the burden of manually keeping embeddings in sync with the source data. (*Cue in collective developer rejoice*)</p><p>This distinction may not seem critical for simple applications that perform a one-time data import for RAG. But for most real-world applications, data is constantly changing. Consider an e-commerce platform that uses embedding-based semantic search across its product catalog, always evolving with new products and updated descriptions. Or a product assistant RAG app that must be kept up to date with the latest product information to give accurate answers to prospective and current customers.</p><p>Manually tracking these changes and regenerating embeddings is not only labor-intensive and error-prone but also distracts developers from focusing on core business objectives. Why waste valuable development time managing this manually when the database system could handle it for you automatically?</p><h2 id="vectorizers-vector-embeddings-as-indexes">Vectorizers: Vector Embeddings as Indexes</h2><p>A more effective abstraction is conceptualizing vector embeddings not as independent tables or data types but as a <strong>specialized index</strong> on the embedded data. This is not to say that vector embeddings are <em>literally</em> indexes in the traditional sense, like those in PostgreSQL or MySQL, which retrieve entire data rows from indexed tables. Instead, vector embeddings function as an indexing mechanism that retrieves the most relevant parts of the data based on its embeddings.</p><p>Rather than indexes, we can call this new index-like abstraction a “<strong>vectorizer</strong>,” as it creates vectors from the underlying source data it is connected to (in other words, vectorizes them). The vectorizer abstraction offers several key advantages:</p><h3 id="automatic-synchronization">Automatic synchronization</h3><p>One of the primary benefits of indexing in databases is that it automatically keeps the index in sync with the underlying data. When the data in a column changes, the index is updated accordingly. By treating vector embeddings as a form of indexing, we can leverage this same automatic synchronization. The system would ensure that vector embeddings are always up-to-date with the latest data, eliminating the need for manual updates and reducing the risk of errors.</p><h3 id="reinforced-data-embedding-relationship">Reinforced data-embedding relationship</h3><p>When vectors are stored independently, it is easy to lose track of their relationship with the original data. Was this vector generated from a recent update to the data? Or is it an outdated vector from a previous embedding model? These questions are critical, and confusion here can lead to significant errors. The relationship is clear and maintained automatically by tying vector embeddings directly to the data as an index.</p><h3 id="simplified-data-management">Simplified data management</h3><p>Developers often face challenges when managing data synchronization manually. For instance, forgetting to delete data from an old embedding model when the underlying data is deleted can cause inconsistencies. The vectorizer abstraction simplifies this process by making it the system’s responsibility to manage these relationships, thus reducing the cognitive load on developers and minimizing the potential for mistakes.</p><h2 id="vectorizers-are-a-natural-evolution-of-the-core-dbms-promise">Vectorizers Are a Natural Evolution of the Core DBMS Promise&nbsp;</h2><p>The vectorizer concept is a natural evolution of modern database management systems (DBMS) capabilities. Today’s DBMSs are already adept at managing data transformations and synchronizations through declarative constructs like indexes, triggers, and materialized views. The vectorizer abstraction fits neatly into this paradigm, providing a new tool for handling the increasingly important task of managing vector embeddings.</p><p>By embedding this functionality directly into the DBMS, we move closer to fulfilling the ultimate promise of database systems: to manage data in a way that abstracts away the complexities, allowing users to focus on what they do best—building applications, analyzing data, and driving innovation.</p><h2 id="implementing-a-vectorizer-for-postgresql-pgai-vectorizer">Implementing a Vectorizer for PostgreSQL: Pgai Vectorizer</h2><p>The good news is that we don’t have to wait long for the vectorizer dream described above to become a reality. Motivated by the promise of making developers’ burdens lighter, our AI Engineering team at Timescale implemented a vectorizer for PostgreSQL. It’s called <a href="https://github.com/timescale/pgai/blob/main/docs/vectorizer.md?ref=timescale.com"><u>pgai Vectorizer</u></a> (currently in Early Access) and is part of the <a href="https://github.com/timescale/pgai?ref=timescale.com"><u>PGAI project</u></a> to make PostgreSQL better for AI systems and make AI development accessible to developers familiar with PostgreSQL.</p><p>If you’d like to see pgai Vectorizer in action, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZoC2XYol6Zk?ref=timescale.com" rel="noreferrer">check out this demo video </a>on how it automatically creates and updates vector embeddings for data in PostgreSQL.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZoC2XYol6Zk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Auto Create and Sync Vector Embeddings in 1 Line of SQL (pgai Vectorizer)"></iframe></figure><p>For more advanced use cases, here's how you can use pgai Vectorizer to easily <a href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/which-openai-embedding-model-is-best/"><u>test different embedding models</u></a>, or test which <a href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/which-rag-chunking-and-formatting-strategy-is-best"><u>chunking and formatting strategy fits your data best</u></a>.</p><h3 id="how-pgai-vectorizer-works">How pgai Vectorizer works</h3><p>Let’s move on to some background on how pgai Vectorizer works and how it brings the discussed advantages to life.</p><p>Developers define and create a vectorizer in SQL. The following query creates a vectorizer and specifies the table it acts on, the column to vectorize, the embedding model to use, and additional formatting for other information to include in the source data to be embedded.</p><pre><code>-- Create a vectorizer to automatically embed data in the blogs table
SELECT ai.create_vectorizer(
   'public.blogs'::regclass
   -- Use Open AI text-embedding-3-small model
 , embedding=&gt;ai.embedding_openai('text-embedding-3-small', 1536, api_key_name=&gt;'OPENAI_API_KEY')
   -- Automatically create a StreamingDiskANN index when table has 100k rows
 , indexing =&gt; ai.indexing_diskann(min_rows =&gt; 100000, storage_layout =&gt; 'memory_optimized'),
   -- Apply recursive chunking on the content column
 , chunking=&gt;ai.chunking_recursive_character_text_splitter('content')
   -- Add metadata from other columns to the embedding for better retrieval
 , formatting=&gt;ai.formatting_python_template('Blog title: $title url: $url blog chunk: $chunk')
);
-- The vectorizer will update the embeddings as the source table changes
-- No other user actions are required</code></pre><p>We also define some default chunking functions since long pieces of text need to be split up into multiple smaller chunks to fit inside embedding model token limits.</p><h4 id="tracking-changes-to-source-data">Tracking changes to source data</h4><p>Under the hood, pgai Vectorizer checks for modifications to the source table (inserts, updates, and deletes) and asynchronously creates and updates vector embeddings. Our team built pgai Vectorizer for two deployment types: <a href="https://github.com/timescale/pgai/blob/main/docs/vectorizer-quick-start.md?ref=timescale.com"><u>self-hosted</u></a> and fully managed in <a href="https://console.cloud.timescale.com/signup/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=vectorlaunch&amp;utm_content=vectorizer-thought-leadership-cta" rel="noreferrer"><u>Timescale Cloud</u></a>.</p><p>In the cloud-hosted implementation of pgai Vectorizer, we use cloud functions in the Timescale Cloud platform to create embeddings. In the open-source version of pgai Vectorizer, embeddings are created by running an external worker.</p><p>Pgai Vectorizer stores the configuration and catalog information along with key internal bookkeeping data inside the database.</p><p>Here’s an overview of the architecture of the pgai Vectorizer system:</p><figure><img src="https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/2024/10/Vector-Databases-are-the-wrong-abstraction_pgai_vectorizer_architecture.png" alt="A diagram representing pgai Vectorizer's system overview." loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1136" srcset="https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/Vector-Databases-are-the-wrong-abstraction_pgai_vectorizer_architecture.png 600w, https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/Vector-Databases-are-the-wrong-abstraction_pgai_vectorizer_architecture.png 1000w, https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/Vector-Databases-are-the-wrong-abstraction_pgai_vectorizer_architecture.png 1600w, https://www.timescale.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2024/10/Vector-Databases-are-the-wrong-abstraction_pgai_vectorizer_architecture.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em>Pgai Vectorizer automatically creates and updates embeddings from a source data table using work queues and configuration tables housed in PostgreSQL. Embeddings are created in an external worker that interacts with embedding services like the OpenAI API.</em></i></figcaption></figure><h4 id="where-are-embeddings-actually-created">Where are embeddings actually created?</h4><p>An important note is that the actual embedding process occurs outside the database in an external process. This helps reduce the load on the database server and means that vectorizers don’t affect the database’s ability to service application queries. It also makes it easier to scale the embedding task independently of other database operations.</p><p>This process first reads the database to see if there is work to be done. If there is, it reads the data from the database, performs chunking and formatting, makes a call to an embedding model provider, such as OpenAI, to generate the embedding, and writes the result back to the database.&nbsp;</p><h4 id="customizing-the-process">Customizing the process</h4><p>Pgai Vectorizer is flexible: You can specify the chunking and formatting rules used to create embeddings. In particular, you can configure which columns of the source table are to be vectorized and the chunking and formatting rules to ensure the source data fits within embedding token limits and that relevant data is contained within each embedding.</p><p>In the Early Access release of pgai Vectorizer, you can customize the choice of OpenAI embedding model (e.g., <code>text-embedding-3-small, text-embedding-3-large, text-embedding-ada-002</code>), chunking strategies to split text into smaller chunks, formatting options to inject additional context into each chunk, and custom indexing configurations for automated index creation and performance tuning. We plan to make this even more flexible soon by allowing users to submit their own Python code to fully customize chunking, embedding, and formatting.</p><p>For example, here’s a vectorizer configured to split HTML source files recursively and create OpenAI embeddings from the source data. You can configure the chunking and formatting to suit your specific application data, whether it be code, documents, markdown, or anything else.</p><pre><code>-- Advanced vectorizer configuration
SELECT ai.create_vectorizer(
   'public.blogs'::regclass,
   destination =&gt; 'blogs_embedding_recursive',
   embedding =&gt; ai.embedding_openai('text-embedding-3-small', 1536),
   -- apply recursive chunking with specified settings for HTML content
   chunking =&gt; ai.chunking_recursive_character_text_splitter(
       'content',
       chunk_size =&gt; 800,
       chunk_overlap =&gt; 400,
       -- HTML-aware separators, ordered from highest to lowest precedence
       separator =&gt; array[
           E'&lt;/article&gt;', -- Split on major document sections
           E'&lt;/div&gt;',    -- Split on div boundaries
           E'&lt;/section&gt;',
           E'&lt;/p&gt;',      -- Split on paragraphs
           E'&lt;br&gt;',      -- Split on line breaks
           E'&lt;/li&gt;',     -- Split on list items
           E'. ',        -- Fall back to sentence boundaries
           ' '          -- Last resort: split on spaces
       ]
   ),
   formatting =&gt; ai.formatting_python_template('title: $title url: $url $chunk')
);</code></pre><p>We plan to detail the design decisions which informed our building of pgai Vectorizer in a future blog post.</p><h2 id="try-pgai-vectorizer-today">Try Pgai Vectorizer Today</h2><p>Try pgai Vectorizer now in Early Access.

With M4, Mac mini delivers up to 1.8x faster CPU performance and 2.2x faster GPU performance over the M1 model.<sup>1</sup> With M4 Pro, it takes the advanced technologies in M4 and scales them up to tackle even more demanding workloads. For more convenient connectivity, it features front and back ports, and for the first time includes Thunderbolt 5 for faster data transfer speeds on the M4 Pro model. The new Mac mini is also built for Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that transforms how users work, communicate, and express themselves while protecting their privacy. And marking an important environmental milestone, Mac mini is Apple’s first carbon neutral Mac with an over 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions across its materials, manufacturing, transportation, and customer use.<sup>2</sup> Starting at just $599 with 16GB of memory, the new Mac mini is available to pre-order today, with availability beginning November 8.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Apple Intelligence ushers in a new era for the Mac, bringing personal intelligence to the personal computer. Combining powerful generative models with industry-first privacy protections, Apple Intelligence harnesses the power of Apple silicon and the Neural Engine to unlock new ways for users to work, communicate, and express themselves on Mac. It is available in U.S. English with macOS Sequoia 15.1. With systemwide Writing Tools, users can refine their words by rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text nearly everywhere they write. With the newly redesigned Siri, users can move fluidly between spoken and typed requests to accelerate tasks throughout their day, and Siri can answer thousands of questions about Mac and other Apple products. New Apple Intelligence features will be available in December, with additional capabilities rolling out in the coming months. Image Playground gives users a new way to create fun original images, and Genmoji allows them to create custom emoji in seconds. Siri will become even more capable, with the ability to take actions across the system and draw on a user’s personal context to deliver intelligence that is tailored to them. In December, ChatGPT will be integrated into Siri and Writing Tools, allowing users to access its expertise without needing to jump between tools.

In addition, users can access ChatGPT for free without creating an account, and privacy protections are built in — their IP addresses are obscured and OpenAI won’t store requests. For those who choose to connect their account, OpenAI’s data-use policies apply.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>The new Mac mini is Apple’s first carbon neutral Mac, marking a significant milestone toward <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/" target="_blank">Apple 2030</a>, the company’s goal to be carbon neutral across the entire carbon footprint by the end of this decade.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Mac mini is made with over 50 percent recycled content overall, including 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, 100 percent recycled gold plating in all Apple-designed printed circuit boards, and 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. The electricity used to manufacture Mac mini is sourced from 100 percent renewable electricity. And, to address 100 percent of the electricity customers use to power Mac mini, Apple has invested in clean energy projects around the world. Apple has also prioritized lower-carbon modes of shipping, like ocean freight, to further reduce emissions from transportation. Together, these actions have reduced the carbon footprint of Mac mini by over 80 percent.<sup>2</sup> For the small amount of remaining emissions, Apple applies high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects, like those generated by its innovative <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/03/apples-restore-fund-cultivates-new-roots-in-the-atlantic-forest/" target="_blank">Restore Fund</a>.

                                                                                                                                                                <div>
    <p><span>As a boy, </span>I knew I was supposed to like cars and trucks and things that go. But as an unathletic and decidedly unboyish kid, I only got close to liking one car—my mom’s blue Volkswagen Ghia, which she used to ferry me to and from school (and, when she needed some time to herself, to her parents’—my grandparents’—house for an overnight visit). In fact, I didn’t just like that car, I loved it, so much so that the day it was towed away I secretly chipped a piece of the sky-colored paint from the chassis and tearfully hid it in a little box. I never had the chance to develop such a special relationship with a truck or a bus or an airplane or anything else with a motor or wheels—in fact, such things scared me, and to this day I have never changed a tire.</p>
<p>In my grandparents’ second-floor guest room, formerly my mother’s childhood room, one bookcase had a row of children’s books slumped to the side, offering a chronological core sample of my grandmother’s attempts to busy not only her own kids, but all the grandkids who’d stayed there before me. There were the original Oz books, a copy of <em>Ferdinand the Bull</em>, Monro Leaf’s inexplicably compelling yet mildly fascistic <em>Manners Can Be Fun, </em>some 1950s and 1960s Little Golden Books purchased at the Hinky Dinky supermarket down the street, and, among many others I’ve now long forgotten, the big blue, green, and red shiny square of Richard Scarry’s <em>Best Word Book Ever. </em>The largish (even just plain large if you were smallish when holding it) book offered a visual index of the everyday puzzle pieces of life in humble, colored-in line drawings. Each page was a fresh, funny composition of some new angle on the world, making the book a sort of quotidian picture-map containing everything imaginable and unimaginable a kid might be curious about: where and how people lived, slept, ate, played, and worked.</p>
<p>The thing is, “people” weren’t anywhere to be seen in <em>Best Word Book Ever</em>. Instead, the whole world was populated by animals: rabbits, bears, pigs, cats, foxes, dogs, raccoons, lions, mice, and more. Somehow, though, that made the book’s view of life feel more real and more welcoming. A dollhouse-like cutaway view of a rabbit family in their house getting ready for their day didn’t seem to just picture the things themselves—they <em>were </em>the things themselves, exuding a grounded warmth that said, “Yes, everywhere we live in houses and cook together and get dressed, just like you.” </p>
</div>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>
    <em>I Am a Bunny </em>stands as one of the true tranquil masterpieces of children’s book art.
    </p>
                                                                                                                                                <div>
    <p>Mirroring these rabbits, across two pages an index-like series of images depicted a bear named Kenny getting out of bed, getting dressed, and going down for breakfast. This would galvanize me to action: I’d take out the book and mimic Kenny, washing my face with a washcloth (which I never did at my own house), brush my teeth, get dressed, and make my bed. Then I’d head downstairs to the kitchen with the book under my pencil-thin arm, where my grandmother would gamely try to serve me the same breakfast Kenny was having, emulating as best she could the individual menu items: pancakes, “warm cereal,” orange juice, bacon, and toast.</p>
<p>A little later in the book, in a two-page spread titled “Mealtime,” a family of orange pigs surrounded a large dinner table laid out with plates and bowls of various foods. The lower left corner of the rightmost page cradled a wooden bowl of evenly green lettuce leaves with three tomato wedges. I don’t know why, but that drawing so thoroughly captured… something for me that, for years at my grandparents’ house, it became my standing side order. While watching television or reading or drawing in the guest room, I’d smell the English muffin toasting and the breaded pork chops and potatoes cooking, and I’d see the setting sunlight warming the house’s old wood shingles—and I’d know my grandmother would have that three-tomato salad on the side, ready for me, just like the pigs were having in Richard Scarry’s book.</p>
<div><p>I must have been a real pain in the ass as a kid. But Richard Scarry somehow made me feel safe and settled.</p></div>
<p><span>this year is </span>the 50th anniversary of Scarry’s 1974 <em>Cars and Trucks and Things That Go, </em>which strikes me as a commemoration worthy of ballyhoo, especially now that, as a dad myself, I’ve spent so much time ferrying my own daughter to and from school and birthday parties in various cars that—well, <em>mostly </em>goed. (I’ve owned five automobiles in my life, all of them cheap, one of which smoked and required the driver’s side door to be kept shut with a bungee cord hooked to the opposite armrest, stretched across both driver and passenger. What can I say? I was a young cartoonist on a cartoonist’s budget.)</p>
<p>Unlike those budget vehicles, however, the new deluxe Penguin Random House anniversary edition of <em>Cars and Trucks and Things That Go </em>is lavishly well-made, attentively reprinted with sharp black lines and warm, rich, watercolors. It includes an especially lively afterword by Scarry’s son Huck, in which he explains, using language even a kid can understand, how his dad wrote and drew the book, as well as hinting at what it was like to grow up as the son of arguably the world’s most popular and successful children’s book author.</p>
<p>Richard McClure Scarry was born on June 5, 1919, in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. His Irish-American father, John James Scarry, ran Scarry’s Department Store so congenially and cannily that even during the Great Depression the whole family—his mother, an aunt, four brothers, and one sister—lived comfortably. According to Walter Retan and Ole Risom’s <em>The Busy, Busy World of Richard Scarry</em>, when Scarry was a boy and his mother asked him to go to the store to get provisions, he would write his grocery list not with words but with pictures. So his mother signed him up for drawing lessons at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, where she also brought him to see the paintings and sculptures. </p>
<p>It took Scarry, who was uninterested in school, five years to receive his high school diploma, in part because he spent a fair amount of his time lazing around at the public library and visiting burlesque shows (this time, one assumes, without his mother). This disappointed his father, who pressured him into going to a local business school, a fate to which Scarry acceded but loathed so deeply he soon withdrew and re-enrolled at the Museum of Fine Arts. “You will live in a garret and eat nothing but spaghetti,” his father warned. But Richard’s mind was made up. Then, after a few classes and December 7, 1941, he was drafted.</p>
<p>Scarry later recalled his experience in the military as “the best war ever.” At basic training in New Jersey, his commanding officers discovered that he could draw, leading Scarry to be largely excused from the rigors of pushups so that he could work as a sign painter. Leapfrogging to the rank of lieutenant (a prerequisite for his new post as art director of the Army in North Africa), he arrived at the port of Casablanca in somewhat plum circumstances, tasked with creating morale-boosting propaganda by doing things like illustrating information manuals and guidebooks and drawing maps describing the worldwide progress of Allied fighting. He and his fellow officers discovered a nice villa twenty miles outside Oran where they were permitted to stay, borrowing their colonel’s Buick to drive themselves back and forth to work. Later stationed in Venice and Paris, Scarry’s experience of World War II was, well, charmed.</p>
<p>After his discharge in 1946, Scarry moved to New York, where he briefly worked as an art director for <em>Vogue </em>and then in an advertising agency before acquiring an agent, who was able to secure him an illustration job with the then brand-new but now completely forgotten <em>Holiday </em>magazine. The job paid the princely sum of $2,000. (I can confirm from personal experience that such pay has changed little since 1946; $2,000 is still the average, if not generous, going rate for magazine artwork. But plugged into an inflation calculator, $2,000 in 1942 clocks in at $34,524.73 today.) With his living expenses suddenly covered well into the future, Scarry moved into a nicer apartment. He met an advertising copywriter named Patricia Murphy, and in 1948 they got married.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Racine, Wisconsin, a printing company named Western Publishing and its imprint Whitman (which had found great success in the 1930s with the Big Little Books and other novelties) were hatching a new idea for children’s literature, a series that would be christened “Little Golden Books.” Up to that point, children’s books had traditionally been a $1.50-and-up Christmas gift—$25.19 in today’s inflationary dollars—luxurious gilt volumes bestowed by great aunts that told of princes and princesses and things that didn’t go anywhere at all. These new Golden Books, by contrast, were to be cheaply produced and democratically priced at twenty-five cents, and would be sold year-round at pharmacies and, as my grandmother referred to them, “dime stores.” </p>
<p>The brainchild of Georges Duplaix and Lucille Ogle, two editors at Western’s recently opened East Coast offices in Poughkeepsie, New York, Golden Books employed displaced if not just plain refugee artists from Europe like Feodor Rojankovsky, Tibor Gergely, and Gustaf Tenggren. Working in a careful, deliberate, and illuminatory style, they carefully limned every hair of every dog—think <em>The Poky Little Puppy</em>—and set every page aglow with a strangely dark, yet warm light. On the page, their paintings were frequently vignetted in darkness, almost as if the artists still felt shadowed by the lingering specter of war. These books, dismissively looked down upon by librarians, were nonetheless immediately, snot-flyingly popular, with orders mounting into the millions of copies. Such publishing numbers were astonishing then (and are even more astonishing now, when 15,000 is considered a gee-whiz success). </p>
<p>Packaged for publishers Richard Simon and Max Schuster and their vice president Albert Leventhal, the entire series was written, drawn, edited, and printed by Western Publishing. A second wave of refugee artists signed on to their roster in 1948, this time escaping Southern California and Walt Disney’s anti-union practices. Among them were John Parr Miller (designer of Dumbo and Geppetto) and the writer-artist team of Alice and Martin Provensen.</p>
<div><p>Scarry wasn’t escaping anything, but he was hired amid this group to do up a four-page promotional brochure for Golden’s push into supermarkets. Impressed by his speedy, quality work, Western followed with a four-book illustration contract, which Scarry flexingly went on to exceed, producing not four, but <em>six </em>books before the one-year deal ran out. (Busy, busy world, indeed.) Wowed, Western signed him on for more, and the Scarrys moved to Connecticut, eventually ending up in Westport, where they went skeet shooting and boating, befriended other Golden Books artists who lived in the area (including Miller and the Provensens), and attended many parties. Then, in 1951, Scarry published his first solo writing and drawing book, <em>The Great Big Car and Truck Book</em>. </p></div>
<p><em><span>the great big car and truck book</span> </em>is, in some ways, the seed-germ of <em>Cars and Trucks and Things That Go</em>. But the differences are revealing. <em>The Great Big Car and Truck Book </em>still follows the house style of Western/Little Golden Books—careful watercolor-and-gouache illustrations that illuminate a text that is about the here and now of what people do all day. Moreover, the people driving the cars and trucks aren’t finely haired rabbits, bears, and pigs, but pink-skinned 1950s human suburbanites. The effect is curious, and, given our now-idea of Scarry, very un-Scarry-like. Like Charles Schulz’s early experiments drawing actual adults in <em>Peanuts </em>(the effect of which is psychedelic), Scarry’s humans feel just, like, <em>wrong</em>. There’s also little to distinguish his work here from other magazine illustrators of the day: the people, while charming enough, are too human to empathize with—oddly blank and impersonal, and advertising-art-like. Scarry had almost always preferred to draw animal stories—<em>Good Night Little Bear, The Bunny Book</em>—in books by his wife or other writers such as his good friend, Danish emigre Ole Risom. But it would be several years before he would do the same in his own books, substituting animals for humans as well as dropping the more labored visual approach for what we now recognize as his mature work.</p>
</div>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>
    In Busytown there’s just enough innocent mayhem and tripping and falling to hint at a darker side of things, like failing 1970s marriages and the things on television news that adults were always yelling about. 
    </p>
                                                                                                                                                <div>
    <p>There were, of course, obstacles. One of the less appealing features of Golden’s business practice was that, with rare exceptions, they offered no royalties. This arrangement nagged at Scarry, especially after his and Patricia’s son Huck was born in 1953, so in 1955 he finally asked the imposing white-haired and lavender-blue-eyed Lucille Ogle for a revised contract that included royalties—and an advance. She readily agreed. Surprised, Scarry asked why she hadn’t offered such a deal earlier. “Because you never asked,” she replied.</p>
<p>With this new contract, though, Golden started to send Scarry less work, and he began to wonder if he was being deliberately snubbed because of his higher pay rate. So even as he was producing beautifully wrought paintings for Golden Books, he sought and then secured additional paying work from Western’s competitor Doubleday. He also created some loose storybook proposals of his own authorship in a surprisingly free and zippy pencil style. Freed from the precision of painting, the linework of these sketches—dare I say, cartoons?—came alive on the page like nothing he’d drawn before. I don’t know if the roughs he produced for his efforts were all so lively, but these certainly showed a new direction, if he decided to take it. But when Scarry shopped the proposals around, Golden and every other publisher he approached turned him down, so he shelved them. </p>

                                                                                                                                                                <div>
    <p>In the years that followed, Scarry continued to do exceptional work in Golden’s illuminated-painting mode, most notably his 1963 book <em>I Am a Bunny, </em>with text by his friend Risom. I never read it as a child, but I can now attest to its elegant, quiet beauty, because it was my daughter’s first word book ever, and I read it to her several hundred times. I never tired of its pictures or its words, the simple zen-like magic it evokes of the inevitability of the passing seasons always somehow putting the reader in a pleasant passenger-seat view. <em>I Am a Bunny </em>stands as one of the true tranquil masterpieces of children’s book art.</p>
<p>Even as he was working on <em>I Am a Bunny, </em>Scarry was preparing a proposal for a new kind of word book done in that free pencil style, which he called <em>Best Word Book Ever</em>. This time around, Golden accepted the proposal, and when the book was published, the fully realized Scarry World exploded into view: clean, pencil-line, doodle-like drawings that seemed lively and alive, if not to live on the very page itself. <em>Richard Scarry’s Best Word Book Ever </em>was an immediate hit, becoming one of the bestselling children’s books in history, selling seven million copies by 1975 (including the one my grandmother bought). And though Scarry was only getting a royalty of eight cents a copy (a royalty that, due to the contract he signed, did not rise in value as the price of books went up), the incredible number of copies the book sold meant that money finally started rolling in for the Scarrys.</p>
<p>Scarry produced two more books for Golden in the <em>Best Word Book Ever </em>mold: <em>Busy, Busy World </em>(1965) and <em>Storybook Dictionary </em>(1967)<em>, </em>the latter of which further plied the icono-lexicographical approach of images-as-words that had made <em>Best Word Book Ever </em>so compelling—the little pictures practically ask the reader to pluck them off the page and play with them. At that point, Random House swooped in and bought Scarry’s next book, <em>What Do People Do All Day?</em>, and became his publisher from then on. (Interestingly, after a 1990s bankruptcy, Random House also became the publisher of the entire Little Golden Books catalogue.)</p>
<p>Scarry followed <em>What Do People Do All Day? </em>with a series of books all set within the same society, including (among others) <em>Great Big Schoolhouse</em>, <em>Cars and Trucks and Things That Go, </em>and <em>Busiest People Ever! </em>The Busytown books, as they came to be known—with their dictionary-like visual presentation paired with lightly slapstick situations and the presence of recurring, memorable characters like Huckle Cat, the Pig family, and my favorite, Lowly Worm—grew into a real-feeling big world that Scarry seemed to be letting little ones into. (Lowly was perhaps the first children’s book animal character with a real nod to the ADA and the myth of “dis”-ability, and cheerfully makes his linear form work in all sorts of inspiring and disarmingly moving ways.)</p>
<p>Scarry’s guides to life both reflected and bolstered kids’ lived experience and in some cases, like my own, even provided the template for it. And while often sweet and quiet in its depiction of a picture-perfect society functioning measuredly—was Busytown urban or suburban or . . . European? (Where did all those Tudor homes and corner groceries come from, anyway?)—there’s just enough innocent mayhem and tripping and falling to hint at a darker side of things, like failing 1970s marriages and the things on television news that adults were always yelling about. </p>
<p>The busiest Busytown book is <em>Cars and Trucks and Things That Go</em>. As fascinated by the industrial world as any serious truck-spotting four-year-old, Scarry captures the ballet of traffic in a sort of frozen mimesis that’s reanimated by the act of reading and page-turning itself. Every aspect of life, however flimsily related to internal combustion travel, seems herein represented: whipped-cream delivery vans, mobile libraries, jet-fuel trucks, bookshelf-maker’s cars, ant buses, two-seater crayon cars, ambulances—the lot. There’s a simple, child-sized joy in recognizing the same characters driving by again and again in animal- and vegetable- and fruit-shaped cars while being dwarfed by accurately rendered bulldozers, heavy cranes, and thundering trucks, all traveling, page by page, left to right in the direction of the book—and the left to right of reading itself—through towns and construction sites and beaches and snow, ultimately ending in a calamitous (safe!) crash and a skidding of little cars spinning leftwards and finally stopping in front of (what else?) “Home.” Adding to the delight, throughout the book a tiny character named Gold Bug (who is literally a gold bug) hides on nearly every page, giving the engaged child a chance to find him over and over again in an exercise that would today be called “interactive” but we used to just call “looking.”</p>
<div><p>The Busytown books were enormous successes in America. But Scarry wrote and drew them in Switzerland, where he decided to move in 1967 after a three-week ski vacation with his son. What seems to have been an impulsive decision starts to makes sense if you’ve spent a few days immersed in Scarry’s work writing an essay for <em>The Yale Review</em>: a decidedly un-American tone runs through much of it. By “un-American” I don’t mean anti-American. Instead, I mean there’s a top-down, citizen-as-responsible-contributor, sense-of-oneself-as-part-of-something-bigger that feels, well, civilized. Even as a kid, I noticed that something about <em>Best Word Book Ever </em>felt odd, and I decided that Scarry was a balding Englishman, tweedy with possible pipe and maybe even one of those mountaineering hats with a feather in it. He was not any of those things. But the more one looks at his work, the more one sees how the European daily grocery trip, the walk to a nearby shop or tradesman’s guild, the tiny apple car fit for a worm are not part of the blowout-all-in-for-oneself-oil-fueled-free-for-all toward which America was barreling in the late 1960s. (Except, perhaps, in <em>Cars and Trucks and Things That Go — </em>though Europe has traffic, too.) So it’s perhaps unsurprising that Scarry spent the rest of his life first in Lausanne and then Gstaad, in a lovely chalet, hardly looking back while America slowly ground itself to pieces.</p></div>
<p><span>scarry continued</span> to produce books for another two decades, all of them featuring animals in place of humans. This actually caused a mild panic at Random House when <em>What Do People Do All Day? </em>was being published, with the staff asking: Shouldn’t it be called <em>What Do Animals Do All Day? </em>The dispute was short-lived since the answer (“No!”) was so obvious, but it hints at something important about the narrative energy on which Scarry’s engine runs. In children’s books, animals are frequently introduced as the first vessels to receive the natural empathy with which children are born. See: Golden’s own <em>Baby Farm Animals </em>(pictures by Garth Williams), <em>The Lively Little Rabbit </em>(pictures by Gustaf Tenggren), <em>The Animals of Farmer Jones </em>(pictures by Scarry), and about ten thousand other children’s books (pictures by everyone else). The natural inclination to ask “do animals feel the same things we do?” is confirmed with a smile and a tuck-in, what in literary terms is cumbersomely called “anthropomorphization” but in everyday words is just “caring.”</p>
<p>As we grow up, though, the truth will out: Mrs. Cow makes a good burger, those chicken fingers were Miss Clucky, and don’t forget to check the trap to see if we caught Mr. Mouse. This all then slides into discovering that not everyone is as nice as they seem, and it’s good to protect oneself on the playground; before long, one can even end up in ROTC, heading into basic training and rolling away in a tank. Fold in the especially twenty-first-century phenomenon of the “first-person shooter” in kids’ video games—surely the most telling perversion of literary terminology America could have hoped for to permanently indict itself—and children’s literature, to say nothing of the idea of polite civilization, is easily relegated to the category of the hopelessly naïve.</p>
</div>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>
    As fascinated by the industrial world as any serious truck-spotting four-year-old, Scarry captures the ballet of traffic in a sort of frozen mimesis that’s reanimated by the act of reading and page-turning itself.
    </p>
                                                                                                                                                <div>
    <p>Scarry studiously avoided granting cows and chickens driver’s licenses. But the pigs? Where’s the bacon in Kenny’s breakfast coming from? So his representation of animal society indeed raises some odd questions, but rarely seems to have bothered readers (with the exception of those literal-minded Random House editors). By contrast, when Art Spiegelman’s graphic novel <em>Maus: A Survivor’s Tale </em>received the Pulitzer Prize in 1992, it provoked vociferous criticism from people offended by its depiction of its characters as animals. Jews were mice (picking up on Hitler’s calling Jews “vermin” or “rats”), Germans were cats, Americans were dogs, (Christian) Poles were pigs, and the French were (of course) frogs. Not surprisingly, many readers also objected to Spiegelman choosing the comic book—a form associated with children’s literature—to tell the story of his mother’s suicide and his father’s nightmarish time in Auschwitz. </p>
<div><p>Such criticisms entirely missed the point of Spiegelman’s work. Originally written as a short comic strip story for Terry Zwigoff’s 1972 underground comic book <em>Funny Animals</em>—which Zwigoff created to benefit animal rights organizations after visiting a slaughterhouse—the strip was later expanded by Spiegelman into a novel-length work. The book turns on the idea of ideas corrupted to the level of Idea: reducing humanity to something to be exterminated by exterminating the ability to see the human being before your very eyes. Had Spiegelman drawn “actual” people, the reader would no longer be complicit in the psychological deformation of the Holocaust itself. Biographically nonfiction in its text yet fiction in its pictures, the book works an ingenious, tortuous turnaround in the mind—and the eye—of the reader. It could not have been told just in words.</p></div>
<p><span>richard scarry’s work</span> could not have been told just in words, either. As Walter Retan and Ole Risom argue, Scarry “didn’t write his stories; he drew them.” His bestselling book was not titled <em>Best Picture Book Ever, </em>even though that’s really what it is. As children, we see the world in all its detail, texture, and beauty, but when we learn the word for, say, a bird, we cease to see it as clearly or curiously as we did before we categorized and dismissed it. John Updike eloquently and beautifully captures this confounding contradiction in his short story “Pigeon Feathers,” where the main character only notices the iridescent, divine beauty in a pigeon’s plumage after he’s shot several of them to pieces in the rafters of a barn. Like it or not, just as adulthood runs roughshod over childhood, words chew images to shreds, and it’s up to the artist—or the writer or the cartoonist—to put those images back together again. Pictures are our first language for understanding the world, but that doesn’t mean they should be ignored in favor of a second. Or, as Dave Eggers once kindly put it, cartoonists (and I include Scarry in this group) needn’t be punished for having two skills instead of one. </p>
<p>Scarry drove headlong into a picture-world that he illustrated with words, a world which blossomed into life in a way that his earlier books for Golden, in which his pictures illustrated words, simply couldn’t. He kept in touch with his child self so well that, as both his biographers and other writers have highlighted, he didn’t test his books on children, because he had “remained very childlike himself.” And he knew exactly where the child inside him still lived: his kind heart.</p>

By the ninth century CE, elements of Samhain had been Christianized via the Feast of All Saints, also known as All Hallow’s Day. Folk customs preserved pre-Christian practices on the evening </span><em>before </em><span>All Hallows’s Day (“All Hallow’s Eve”). These, it is claimed, developed into the rudiments of the modern holiday of Halloween in the early modern British Isles, especially Ireland. </span></p><p>Meanwhile, in 16th century Mexico, Aztec devotion to Mictecacihuatl, the Lady of the Dead, merged with the Feast of All Saints.

In Celtic cultures, at least, there appears to have been a shift; human beings lived in the realm above, and the gods lived below in the Underworld. This may be the result of changes in religious belief and practice which started in the late Bronze Age in Europe, in which the religious focus on the heavens (as evident from pre-Iron Age monuments and alignments) changed to focus on the lower world. All across Europe, offerings began to be made into bodies of water (and ostensibly, into the earth as well). It has been theorized that this took place due to deterioration in climate in the later Bronze Age.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-150850410" href="https://resobscura.substack.com/p/a-very-deep-history-of-halloween#footnote-3-150850410" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p></blockquote><p>As an example of post-christian survivals of this cosmology, MacLeod cites the case of an Irish priest living in 8th century Germany —&nbsp;Virgil by name — who angered the Pope himself with his heretical preaching that “there was another world and other men beneath the earth.”</p><p>Back to a potential link between the Persian rites around Nowruz and the modern Halloween. </p><p><span>It at least seems possible that there was a set of proto-Indo-European beliefs and rituals involving an evening which briefly parted the veil between the human world and the world of the dead/spirits/deities (a word which, originally, meant “shining like the sun”). Among the ancient Iranians, this realm of the divine continued to be the sky. And, by extension, the ritual fires which moved from earth </span><em>to </em><span>the sky. It is notable that both Samhain and the festivities before Nowruz involve ritual bonfires. </span></p><p><span>At some point, as MacLeod writes, the Celtic branch of this ritual tradition shifted the location of the spirits/dead/gods from the sky to the earth or water (though still emphasizing links to the sky, via the passage tombs oriented toward the sun). This may be reflected in the archaeological record of the la Tené culture, famous for its votive offerings deposited in wetlands and bogs. In fact, it has been theorized that the famous “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog_body" rel="">bog bodies</a><span>” of proto-Celtic Europe were ritual human sacrifices that reflected this tradition —&nbsp;and, indeed, that some bog bodies may have been killed on or around the date of Samhain.</span></p><p><span>Is it coincidence, then, that the term </span><em><a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/fabl.1977.18.1.226/html" rel="">jack-o’-lantern</a></em><span> “comes from the phenomenon of strange lights flickering over peat bogs”? </span></p><p><span>Maybe so. But then again, maybe not. One thing I love about history is that some things </span><em>really do</em><span> go back ten thousand years — the myth of a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/*%E1%B8%B0%C3%A9rberos" rel="">dog that guards the gates of the underworld</a><span>, for instance.

<p dir="auto">An AI agent that generates integration code by reverse-engineering platforms' internal APIs.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Integuru in Action</h2><a id="user-content-integuru-in-action" aria-label="Permalink: Integuru in Action" href="#integuru-in-action"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Integuru-AI/Integuru/blob/main/integuru_demo.gif"><img src="https://github.com/Integuru-AI/Integuru/raw/main/integuru_demo.gif" alt="Integuru in action" data-animated-image=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What Integuru Does</h2><a id="user-content-what-integuru-does" aria-label="Permalink: What Integuru Does" href="#what-integuru-does"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You use <code>create_har.py</code> to generate a file containing all browser network requests, a file with the cookies, and write a prompt describing the action triggered in the browser. The agent outputs runnable Python code that hits the platform's internal endpoints to perform the desired action.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How It Works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How It Works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Let's assume we want to download utility bills:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>The agent identifies the request that downloads the utility bills.
For example, the request URL might look like this:
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="https://www.example.com/utility-bills?accountId=123&amp;userId=456"><pre><code>https://www.example.com/utility-bills?accountId=123&amp;userId=456
</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>It identifies parts of the request that depend on other requests.
The above URL contains dynamic parts (accountId and userId) that need to be obtained from other requests.

</li>
<li>It finds the requests that provide these parts and makes the download request dependent on them.
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="GET https://www.example.com/get_account_id
GET https://www.example.com/get_user_id"><pre><code>GET https://www.example.com/get_account_id
GET https://www.example.com/get_user_id
</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>This process repeats until the request being checked depends on no other request and only requires the authentication cookies.</li>
<li>The agent traverses up the graph, starting from nodes (requests) with no outgoing edges until it reaches the master node while converting each node to a runnable function.</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Generate a dependency graph of requests to make the final request that performs the desired action.</li>
<li>Allow input variables (for example, choosing the YEAR to download a document from). This is currently only supported for graph generation. Input variables for code generation coming soon!</li>
<li>Generate code to hit all requests in the graph to perform the desired action.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Setup</h2><a id="user-content-setup" aria-label="Permalink: Setup" href="#setup"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Set up your OpenAI <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys" rel="nofollow">API Keys</a> and add the <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> environment variable. (We recommend using models that are at least as capable as OpenAI o1-mini. Models on par with OpenAI o1-preview are ideal.)</li>
<li>Install Python requirements via poetry:

</li>
<li>Open a poetry shell:

</li>
<li>Run the following command to spawn a browser:
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="poetry run python create_har.py"><pre><code>poetry run python create_har.py
</code></pre></div>
Log into your platform and perform the desired action (such as downloading a utility bill).</li>
<li>Run Integuru:
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="poetry run python -m integuru --prompt &quot;download utility bills&quot;"><pre><code>poetry run python -m integuru --prompt "download utility bills"

</code></pre></div><p>At first glance, this sounds pretty bad. One of my servers suddenly deciding to
start sending SSH connections to the wider internet. This is usually a pretty
strong indicator of malware compromise, and I had to act quickly if that was
the case. Luckily, I’ve worked in infosec for a while, and some years ago I
even did some freelance work doing forensics and cleanup of infected servers.</p><p>So, not completely out of my element, I was surprised when after an hour or two
I found no evidence of anything happening out of the ordinary. It’s always hard
to prove a negative, but really, the machine was fine. No odd process, no
filesystem modifications, no odd network traffic (as observed by the
hypervisor, not by the server itself which happens to be a VM - just to be
extra sure!). If it was a malware compromise incident, the malware would have
been pretty stealthy, and that runs against the idea of it having been
commanded to scan the internet - in general, a very loud and noticeable action.</p><p>I turned to the regularly running services on the machine. This is my main
datacenter-hosted server, and I run a bunch of distributed or federated
services on there:</p><ul><li>Syncthing relay.</li><li>Mastodon instance.</li><li>Tor relay (not exit, internal node only).</li><li>Matrix homeserver.</li></ul><p>After close inspection, the Tor relay does connect to a few other relays that
are hosted on port 22, but that’s a very limited set of IPs, and it doesn’t
include anything in the network that sent my ISP the abuse complaint. Unlikely
candidate. I thought maybe Matrix or Mastodon could be abused to send commanded
requests to arbitrary IP:port destinations, but logging for both indicated
nothing of the sort was (visibly) happening. The Sidekiq queue for my Mastodon
instance was also absent of any trace of this, when I’d have expected to see
e.g. retries queued if it was involved.</p><p>What was happening there? Was the abuse complaint just bogus?</p><h2 id="the-smoking-gun">The smoking gun</h2><p>Then, I noticed something in one of my <code>tcpdump</code> that was still running to
monitor traffic involving port 22 on that server. I had originally ran
<code>tcpdump</code> filtering on <code>dst port 22</code>, since this is what would show traffic
originating from my server going to remote destinations. However, for some
reason, I dropped that filter at some point, instead filtering <code>not src host 195.201.9.37</code> instead (my server’s IP). This is when this showed up:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code>04:14:25.286063 IP 45.187.212.68.22 &gt; 195.201.9.37.59639: Flags [R.], seq 0, ack 41396686, win 0, length 0

</code></pre></div><p>Something <em>was</em> in fact going on. But not at all what I was expecting. Turns
out: no connections were coming out of my server and going to the port 22 of
random machines. But some random internet machines <em>were</em> in fact sending me
TCP reset packets.</p><p>If you’ve been around networking/infosec communities for a while, you might now
be screaming: backscatter! Source IP spoofing! And yeah, this was my first
thought too. Let’s do a quick aside to go into what those things mean.</p><h2 id="ip-spoofing-on-the-internet">IP spoofing on the internet</h2><p>Turns out, it’s pretty trivial to send packets to various destinations on the
Internet with a fake source IP address (of course, the destination IP needs to
be correct, since it determines… the destination). Many ISPs adhere to the
<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp38" target="_blank">Best Current Practice (BCP) 38</a>, which
can be summarized by the following: “if you peer with a network, you should
only allow them to send IP packets using IP address you expect from them”.
Unfortunately, that filtering can often only be done early on in a packet’s
route to its destination. Once the packet gets to a large transit provider,
their peers expect that provider to carry traffic from the whole internet to
them, and thus are not able to do any meaningful filtering.</p><p>Which means, if you just find one transit provider which doesn’t do BCP38
filtering… you can send IP packets tagged with any source IP you want! And
unfortunately, even though the origins of BCP38 date back to 1998… there are
still network providers 25 years later that don’t implement it. APNIC has <a href="https://blog.apnic.net/2023/05/03/why-is-source-address-validation-still-a-problem/" target="_blank">a
great article from last year on the subject</a>.</p><p>The consequences in practice shouldn’t be too bad. TCP, QUIC, and generally
anything using (d)TLS requires roundtrips, which can’t happen when a source IP
is spoofed. Spoofing the source IP means that you get to send a “wrong”
packets, but the replies to that packet still get sent to the source IP you
spoofed, the spoofer doesn’t get to see them and process them. There are a few
well known abuse vectors that rely on spoofing, such as reflection DDoS, but
it’s not usually a concern.</p><p>Unless…</p><h2 id="guessing-the-motive">Guessing the motive</h2><p>Let’s come back to my <code>RST</code> packets. The main hypothesis is that someone is
using my source IP to send outbound connections to the port 22 of various
internet machines. But it doesn’t really make logical sense at a first glance.
Usually, people would do this to scan for open ports or servers with a working
SSH server. However, none of that works when you spoof a source IP, since you
don’t get to see the results of you probing!</p><p>Back in the earlier days of the internet, there used to be a technique called
“Idle Scanning”, which relied on 1. servers being way less busy than today; 2.
network stacks lacking randomization of some fields and using auto-incrementing
predictable counters. This could be used to probe whether a port is open while
spofing a source IP (for anonymity, or to bypass firewalls). But that technique
has been dead and unusable for decades.</p><p>So, maybe someone set up a scanner and typo’d their source IP in a
configuration file, causing random internet machines to think I’m initiating
connections to them? But… the traffic volume seems too low, the duration of
the weirdness too long, and really it would be a stretch anyway.</p><p>Whatever the spoofer’s motive, it’s kind of annoying. Their scan is hitting
honeypots, networks with intrusion detection systems that send (sometimes
automated) abuse complaints, and so on. I wish they’d notice that whatever
they’re doing isn’t working, because I don’t particularly enjoy getting abuse
complaints, and they put me at risk of being kicked out of my hosting provider.</p><p>… wait a minute?!</p><h2 id="the-tor-connection">The Tor connection</h2><p>I mentioned in passing earlier that one of the services I run on my server is a
Tor relay. Relays are internal nodes of the Tor network. They only carry
anonymous, encrypted traffic (in fact, usually with multiple layers of
encryption), and only between consenting opt-in nodes of the Tor network.
Relays aren’t exit nodes, they don’t talk to the open internet. A few selected
relays are also “Guard Nodes”, which can serve as the entry point to the Tor
network. These technically talk to the open internet, but still, only
consenting users connecting to the Tor network.</p><p>For that reason I originally kind of ruled out Tor having any connection (pun
intended) to this abuse issue. And I’m sure some of you were screaming about
it, but hey, you probably have the benefit of 1. hindsight; 2. not being up at
4AM running <code>tcpdump</code>.</p><p>But Tor has one peculiarity: there are actors on the internet that don’t like
it. There are many good and bad reasons for this - I personally view Tor as a
“useful neutral cesspool”, but this is not an article about ethics, and it’s
simple enough to say that some people disagree. Said people range from
“individual hacktivists” to “police forces” to “government agencies”, with
various levels of sophistications and differing techniques.</p><p>Could someone be deliberately trying to induce abuse complaints on Tor network
participants to take down parts of the network (or disincetivize running
internal nodes, which are key for the network’s health)?</p><p>Easy enough to check. I run more relay nodes, so let’s just <code>tcpdump</code> there
too. One at home on my residential IP connection, one on a Linode VPS in Japan:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code>04:19:14.705034 IP 198.30.233.69.22 &gt; 172.105.199.155.39998: Flags [R.], seq 0, ack 171173954, win 0, length 0

</code></pre></div><p>Annnnnd yep, my two other relays running in completely different countries and
with completely different ISPs are seeing the same spoofed TCP SYN pattern.</p><p>This is when I sent <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2024-October/021953.html" target="_blank">an email to the <code>tor-relays</code> mailing list</a>,
where… it turns out someone had <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/network-health/analysis/-/issues/85" target="_blank">noticed and diagnosed the same thing</a>
a few days before. This spoofing “attack” actually started on other types of
nodes before migrating to relays, and those other nodes were hit with a much
larger volume of spoofed connections, leading to them actually getting
temporarily taken down in some cases! Proving the attack does in fact work…</p><h2 id="you-could-be-the-target-too">You could be the target too!</h2><p>To recap what’s (probably) going on:</p><ol><li>A malicious attacker has access to a network without BCP38 filtering.</li><li>They send TCP connection requests to port 22 on many random internet
machines - possibly deliberately selecting known honeypots or networks known
to send automated abuse complaints.</li><li>Those TCP connection requests use a spoofed source IP address, making the
destination machines think the spoofed source sent that connection. They
become the target of the automated abuse complaints.</li><li>With a large enough volume, the spoofed IP quickly becomes widely
blacklisted from many internet entities following blocklists, and the
hosting provider might take action due to many abuse reports and shut down
the server for being compromised / malicious.</li></ol><p>There is nothing at all in this attack that’s specific to Tor! I’m actually
surprised this is the first time I hear of this, because while ingenious,
nothing in there seems particularly difficult to do for a single motivated
attacker. You, too, can probably make your friend’s hosting provider (with
their consent, of course) shut down their server and cancel their hosting
contract by getting them flooded with well-meaning but confused abuse
complaints.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The internet was broken 25 years ago and is still broken 25 years later.
Spoofed source IP addresses should not still be a problem in 2024, but the
larger internet community seems completely unwilling to enforce any kind of
rules or baseline security that would make the internet safer for everyone.
This is not just BCP38 - RPKI is a similar disaster in terms of deployment, and
has only started ramping up because it impacts large internet companies who
started enforcing requirements on their direct peers.</p><p>It’s not clear to me what the next steps are in regards to this attack. It’s
clearly already in the wild. I don’t know if it was already known and
documented. But it still seems to be working, it’s hard to track (I don’t know
of any way one could figure out the real source of a spoofed IP packet - there
is no “after the fact” traceroute, and even if there was, it would have to be
done by some upstream provider to get useful info).</p><p>However, if you now get such an abuse complaint, you might now have a better
idea what to look for and what to reply to your hosting provider to try and
convince them you are in fact a victim and not a perpetrator! Who knows, they
might even care to listen.</p><hr><p><em>This article was written in a rush a few hours before getting on a plane.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      
      <p>Alright, let me share the full story of how my 14-year-old <a href="https://instagram.com/">Instagram</a> account, @javier, was stolen and ended up in the
hands of a hip-hop producer—and why I believe it was an inside job.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>First off, here’s some backstory: I’ve had the @javier username since October 2010, the same month the app launched. I
joined so early, that I even have emails reporting bugs to <a href="https://x.com/joshriedel">@joshriedel</a>, Instagram’s very first employee.</p>



<p>Over the past 14 years, I’ve received countless messages to buy my account. Early on, I made a conscious decision not to
engage with these requests. Rather than blocking people, I simply ignored them or restricted their accounts when that
feature became available.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I even created a quick iMovie compilation of some of the messages I received in 2018. Since then, the
volume of messages has only increased.</p>

</div>
<p>I’ve keep taking screenshots of everyone who’s asked about acquiring my account. One interesting pattern: the majority
of these requests come from profiles without any photos. I find it so weird that people are so eager to get a username
when they don’t even share content!</p>

<h3 id="the-theft">The Theft</h3>

<p>Alright, back to the story. On Wednesday, October 23rd, around 7 PM Spanish time, after I got killed for the thousandth
time in Elden Ring, I opened Instagram and found myself logged out.</p>

<p>While I’d occasionally received notifications about suspicious activity requiring identity verification, this was
different—a complete logout. When I saw this, I knew my worst fear had finally become reality: I had lost my Instagram
account.</p>

<p>When I attempted to log back in, my password was rejected. Using the password recovery option, I discovered something
alarming: the email associated with my account had been changed to an address I didn’t recognize: r*******e@gmail.com</p>

<p>At this point, my @javier account still displayed all my content, but I knew this wouldn’t last long. I tried
Instagram’s hacked account reporting page, but it was ineffective: when I entered my username the page simply reloaded
without any confirmation.</p>

    <source data-src="https://img.javier.computer/instagram/login.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
  
  
</div>
<p>After exhausting all recovery methods, I refreshed my now-inaccessible account to find all my content replaced by 4
posts. Here’s my account before and after the robbery.</p>



<p>The hackers had moved my content to a new account, @javier.typeshi, stripped of my profile photo and description,
ironically adding the text “meta official”.</p>

    </figure>
    
  </div>
<p>The profile picture in that account belongs to a man also named Javier Arce. He was a journalist that worked for
@azcentral <a href="https://eu.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2024/09/06/javier-arce-la-voz-and-arizona-republic-journalist-dies-at-age-48/75106323007">who sadly passed away from stomach cancer last month</a>.</p>

<p>Before turning to Twitter for help (where I was flooded with recovery scams), I created a new account to request my
content back. They never responded. I knew the chances were pretty low, and that they would probably try to extort me,
but hey I had to ask.</p>

<h3 id="the-investigation">The Investigation</h3>

<p>Ok, before I move on and tell you about the new owner of the account, let’s do some conspirancy talk and let me explain
how I think my account was stolen.</p>

<p>My account was well-protected with 2FA and linked to a unique, private email address that I’d never shared. I use
1Password and am extremely careful about security. I’ve never entered my Instagram credentials on any third-party
websites or apps, nor have I ever shared 2FA codes.</p>

<p>On the day of the event, I received no email or phone notification about any unusual access attempts. So here’s what I
believe it happened: it wasn’t a phising attack, it was somebody from inside the company.</p>

<p>This wouldn’t be unprecedented. <a href="https://www.cshub.com/attacks/news/meta-fires-employees-for-allegedly-hacking-into-users-accounts">Meta has previously fired employees for hacking user accounts</a>, and there’s a thriving
black market for usernames on forums like <a href="https://oguser.com/">oguser.com</a></p>

<h3 id="the-new-owner">The New Owner</h3>

<p>Back to the story. Let me tell you about the new account owner. His name is Javier “Jay” Sang. Looking at the tagged
photos, he seems to be the founder and CEO of a label called Rebel Music.</p>

<p>And do you remember how I take a screenshot of every account that ask me to sell or change my username? Jay did that in April this year. It seems he may have sought alternative means after I didn’t respond to his request lol</p>

    </figure>
    
  </div>
<h3 id="current-status">Current Status</h3>

<p>As for the current situation: so far, I’ve regained control of the renamed account with all my content and messages, but
I still haven’t recovered my original username.</p>

<p>I’m receiving help from an Instagram employee, and through my network of friends and their connections I’ve made contact
with other folks at the company who have expressed interest in my case and offered their assistance. I’m very grateful
for that.</p>

<p>In fact, I doubt I would have been able to recover my content without those connections at the company. This highlights a serious issue that Instagram and Meta need to address in their account recovery process.</p>

<p>And I’m not the only person with this problem. A few days ago, I learned that @joao, another long-time user, also lost his Instagram handle in a similar way last year, and he still hasn’t heard back from Instagram.</p>

<p>For reasons unknown to me, regaining access to my content was easy, but reclaiming my original username is much harder.
And while I’m optimistic about getting my old username back, I’m sure this won’t be the last hack attempt on my account.</p>

<p>The end. Thanks for reading this far! If you’re wondering how you can help, I’d appreciate it if you shared this thread.
And if you know <a href="https://x.com/mosseri">@mosseri</a>, please let him know one of Instagram’s earliest users is frustrated and thinking of leaving.</p>

One night, one of his teammates bought some cannabis edibles to share, and Joe ate some. For the next 12 hours, he believed he was in hell. He was on fire; his body was suffused with pain. His ears were filled first with incoherent screaming and then with sinister whispering. Joe’s friends thought their teammate’s bad trip was funny, even as they wrestled him away from the windows when he tried to jump from the seventh floor of their hotel.</p><p>When he woke up the next morning, Joe was still in hell. A devilish, humanoid form lurking in the periphery of his vision was telling him he had died the previous night. A chorus of other voices joined in, wailing in agony. They were entirely real to him, even though he knew they couldn’t be. He had a rugby match to play, and 10 minutes in, he couldn’t see or feel his hands; he couldn’t move. His teammates laughed as he came off the pitch. Poor old Joe.</p><p>The voices came back to the UK with him. “You’re not real,” they told him incessantly. “You’re already dead, so it doesn’t matter if you end it all again.” He saw blurred, demonic faces smirking at him, sometimes at the edge of his eye line, sometimes up against his face, too close to be in focus.</p><figure id="75c14611-ab14-42df-aff4-7dc45fd0a0d4" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:3,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Using avatars in psychosis therapy can help those who hear voices, study finds &quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;75c14611-ab14-42df-aff4-7dc45fd0a0d4&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/oct/28/using-avatars-in-psychosis-therapy-can-help-those-who-hear-voices-study-finds&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:1,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>His parents knew he had struggled with depression and anxiety before, but Joe didn’t want to tell anyone about the voices. He drank heavily, every blackout providing temporary respite. He would walk for hours, playing music on his headphones, desperate to drown out the voices. At other times Joe would tell the voices to fuck off, shut up, leave him alone. He would find himself saying these things out loud, in public. Seeing himself reflected in the fearful eyes of those he walked past, he was terrified that he would never find a way to be normal among them again.</p><p>Joe was later told he was experiencing acute psychosis. About <a href="https://www.derbyshirehealthcareft.nhs.uk/services/mental-health-and-emotional-wellbeing/early-intervention-psychosis" data-link-name="in body link">two or three people in every 100</a> experience psychosis, when reality is disrupted by delusions or hallucinations. It can be a symptom of schizophrenia or severe depression, but can also be experienced without any other mental health condition. The acute form – the sudden, rapid onset of auditory or visual hallucinations that Joe experienced – can be triggered by drugs in people who, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0020764018801690" data-link-name="in body link">because of existing biological and social factors</a>, might be predisposed to psychosis. Hearing voices is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735809001615?via%3Dihub" data-link-name="in body link">the most common form</a> of psychosis, affecting <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22446568/" data-link-name="in body link">as many as 70%</a> of people with schizophrenia, and the voices heard tend to be persecutory and distressing. More than one in 10 people with schizophrenia end up <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1845151/" data-link-name="in body link">taking their own lives</a>.</p><p>Antipsychotic medications, the go-to treatment since the mid-20th century, can come with serious side-effects, including weight gain, exhaustion, bed-wetting, sexual dysfunction and severe constipation. And they don’t work for everyone: a quarter of people on antipsychotics will continue to hear voices. The most effective medication, Clozapine, is only used where other antipsychotics have failed because it can cause even more severe side-effects. It was developed in the 1950s; there has been little drug innovation for psychosis in recent decades. There are also non-pharmacological treatments; cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp), when combined with medication, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6280425/" data-link-name="in body link">improves symptoms</a> for about 50% of people.</p><p>After hearing the voices for two and a half years, Joe went to his GP in winter 2021 and received his formal diagnosis. He was put on a low dose of antipsychotic medication, which he hated: he couldn’t get out of bed, couldn’t function and, while it helped with his visual hallucinations, the voices remained. He came off the medication after two months. Depressed, despairing and starting to spiral, he got back in touch with his GP, who told him there was something else to try: an experimental therapy, a clinical trial he could be part of, that turned the traditional treatment model for psychosis on its head.</p><p>If you hear voices, clinicians don’t generally ask what they’re saying to you, beyond whether they are asking you to harm yourself or others. “There’s been a reluctance to engage much with the content of voices,” Ben Alderson-Day, an associate professor of psychology at Durham University who specialises in psychosis, told me. “That’s in part because of a concern that if you ask voice-hearers to elaborate, you might engage in ‘collusion’: you may make [the voices] more real for people.” A clinician may diagnose a patient with psychosis, and prescribe them medication or CBT, without knowing what the patient’s voices say to them.</p><p>This new therapy demanded that voices were listened to closely, and responded to as if they were spoken by entirely real external beings. Trial participants would create an avatar of their voice: a moving, three-dimensional digital embodiment that looks and sounds like the persecutor inside their heads. They would be guided by a therapist to have a dialogue with the voice – and the hope was, through doing so, gain control over it.</p><p>Within a few weeks, the voice that told Joe he was dead – the one he so feared could be real – was manifested in colour in front of him. For the therapy to work, he needed to find the courage to look the demon in the eyes; to challenge and conquer it. If he succeeded, the voices might fade away.</p><hr><p><span>P</span>rof Julian Leff was seven years into his retirement when the idea of avatar therapy came to him. After a celebrated career as a social psychiatrist and schizophrenia specialist at University College London, Leff was sitting at home in Hampstead, pondering the results of a survey that reported the most distressing aspect of hearing voices was the feeling of helplessness. On the rare occasions when his patients had had meaningful exchanges with their voices, he knew they had felt more in control. “I thought, how can I enable the patient to have a dialogue with an invisible voice?” Leff said in an interview for a documentary made in 2018, three years before his death. “If I can somehow manage to create for the patient the image and voice of the person who they hear abusing them, maybe they could learn to overcome this awful persecution.”</p><p>Leff was awarded a small grant for a pilot study in 2008. He recruited Mark Huckvale, professor of speech, hearing and phonetic sciences at UCL, to be in charge of the tech. They tinkered with existing police identikit software, animating digitally created faces in three dimensions so they could nod, smile and maintain eye contact. They combined this with an off-the-shelf programme called Lip Synch, so that the mouth would move appropriately, and voice-changing software, so the avatar could be made to sound male or female, rougher or smoother, higher or lower, older or younger.</p><p>The avatar was a floating, moving head on a computer screen, voiced by Leff, who would be in a separate room to the patient, watching via webcam. He could speak to the patient in his own voice, guiding them through the dialogue, and then switch with the click of a mouse to the role of the avatar on the patient’s screen, its lips synched to his speech. The setup allowed him to act as a therapist to the patient and a puppeteer to the avatar. At first, the avatar would say typical lines the patient had shared with Leff: often degrading, abusive phrases. But over the course of six sessions, the dialogue would change, with the avatar yielding to the patient, transforming from omnipotent to submissive. At all times, Leff and the patient were to treat the avatar as if it were an entirely real third party.</p><p>Sixteen people – all of whom had heard voices for years, despite being on medication – participated in this pilot study. A man who had heard the devil incessantly for 16 years was instructed by Leff to tell his demon avatar he didn’t deserve to be persecuted and he should go back to hell and torment those who did. An older man, who had been woken every morning at 5am for more than three years by the voice of a woman conducting noisy business meetings in his head, was encouraged by Leff to tell her it was unprofessional to allow him to overhear her discussions. To Leff’s surprise, both of these men stopped hearing their voices entirely after only three sessions. While most patients did not experience such a dramatic change, the results were still impressive: for 13 of the 16 participants, voices remained, but they were less frequent and intrusive, and suicidal feelings were significantly reduced.</p><p>The therapy had made a significant difference to a sample group composed of people for whom all other forms of treatment had failed. But other clinicians were wary of taking the results of the pilot seriously, believing they might be a consequence of Leff’s skill as a therapist, rather than the therapy itself. “He did have a magic touch,” Tom Craig, professor of psychiatry at King’s College London (KCL), told me. But Craig was sufficiently impressed by the results to lead a randomised controlled trial on 150 patients, along with Philippa Garety, professor of clinical psychology. Leff trained Craig and the clinical psychologist Tom Ward to deliver the therapy in his place, giving them audio recordings of his sessions and a checklist of how he thought things ought to be done, which Craig and Ward turned into a manual.</p><p>“Within the first couple of cases, we thought: this is extraordinary – something’s really happening here that we’ve never seen before,” Craig said. One participant, Chris, had been persecuted for years by the voices of high court judges who denounced him for intrusive sexual thoughts. Through the therapy, Chris came to accept his sexual urges as normal, and his high court judge avatar ultimately told him he had no case to answer. Free from persecution, Chris was able to go on dates for the first time in years.</p><p>Avatar therapy was <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(17)30427-3/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link">found to be quicker,</a> cheaper and more effective after 12 weeks than any other non-pharmacological intervention currently available for people with psychosis. It worked, even without Leff, on a larger scale, and it worked faster than the control therapy delivered by highly trained clinicians.</p><p>As for the concern that engaging with auditory hallucinations exacerbates psychosis, Al Powers, associate professor of psychiatry at Yale University, told me it was not backed by empirical data. “Despite popular wisdom about not wanting to collude with the voices, the evidence that’s emerging seems to indicate that engagement-based approaches are most effective in terms of increasing control over voices, and also achieving some degree of mastery over them.”</p><p>Despite its early success in trials, Alderson-Day warns against viewing avatar therapy as a cure-all for psychosis. “The idea of a single therapeutic option for all kinds of voices is very unlikely,” he said. “Some people’s auditory experiences aren’t even voice-like, so there won’t be content to work with,” he told me. But if avatar therapy could be quicker and more cost-effective than existing treatments, he said, it was worth pursuing.</p><p>The research team’s next step was to demonstrate that avatar therapy could work when delivered by a broad range of therapists in different locations. A new trial, <a href="https://www.avatartherapytrial.com/" data-link-name="in body link">Avatar 2</a>, began in 2021, and involved 19 trained therapists in four different sites across the UK. There were 345 individuals enrolled in it – including Joe.</p><hr><p><span>J</span>oe was nervous about designing his avatar. No one had ever asked him to describe what his voices looked or sounded like before. He had spent so much energy telling himself they couldn’t be real and now he had to manifest them in the real world. There were other challenges: like most people with psychosis, Joe heard several voices, and he experienced them more as a felt presence, rather than a single entity with a definite physical appearance and a familiar face.</p><p>Tom Ward, who was assigned to be Joe’s therapist, told me the average number of voices heard by people with psychosis is four. “We are looking for the dominant voice that’s causing the most distress.” Joe chose the voice who told him there was no point in living because he was already dead.</p><p>He and Ward began creating the avatar’s face. There was a blizzard of choices in drop-down menus on Ward’s laptop screen: <em>is it a human or non-human entity</em>? If it’s human, what is its <em>gender, age, height (tall, medium, short), ethnicity (European, </em><em>east Asian, </em><em>south Asian, African)</em>? If it’s non-human, <em>does it take the form of a devil, angel, alien, vampire, robot, witch, goblin, elf, beast</em>? Once a basic form is chosen, there are sliders to change the physiognomy: making the nose broader, thinner, shorter or longer; adjusting the eyes, brow and chin; modifying the hairstyle.</p><p>Joe found it hard to describe what the voice looked like: it was often hooded, masked, out of focus, only partially visible. It was demonic, but it didn’t look like a devil. Together, they created the head of a bald man with olive skin, like Joe’s. He chose between five versions of voices, and used sliders to change the pitch, tilt and roughness. The final voice was deeper than any human’s. That’s what made it demonic, for Joe.</p><figure id="1607a6ea-93ed-414d-b6d7-0520c2c5746b" data-spacefinder-role="immersive" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79542b4dfbf8276e166ca9b09d6654de11162926/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79542b4dfbf8276e166ca9b09d6654de11162926/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79542b4dfbf8276e166ca9b09d6654de11162926/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1140&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79542b4dfbf8276e166ca9b09d6654de11162926/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1140&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79542b4dfbf8276e166ca9b09d6654de11162926/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1125&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79542b4dfbf8276e166ca9b09d6654de11162926/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1125&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79542b4dfbf8276e166ca9b09d6654de11162926/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=965&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 740px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 740px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79542b4dfbf8276e166ca9b09d6654de11162926/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=965&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 740px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79542b4dfbf8276e166ca9b09d6654de11162926/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=725&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79542b4dfbf8276e166ca9b09d6654de11162926/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=725&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79542b4dfbf8276e166ca9b09d6654de11162926/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=645&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79542b4dfbf8276e166ca9b09d6654de11162926/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=645&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79542b4dfbf8276e166ca9b09d6654de11162926/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79542b4dfbf8276e166ca9b09d6654de11162926/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="AI Avatars Long Read | Illustration 02 | DIGITAL" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79542b4dfbf8276e166ca9b09d6654de11162926/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="465" height="279" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span> Illustration: Nick Kempton</figcaption></figure><p>It wasn’t exactly right, but once Joe was alone with the screen there was something about the avatar that resonated. Ward reminded Joe he was there to support him. Before they went into their separate rooms, they had practised what the avatar was going to say, and how Joe might respond to it. Still, he felt terrified.</p><p>“You’re already dead,” the avatar told him, in a voice that was almost monotone. “You’ve been in hell all this time and this is your existence from now on.”</p><p>“If this is death, it’s exactly the same as what my idea of life was,” Joe replied, a little meekly. He was surprised by how realistic the experience was, how true to life this felt.</p><p>“You’re lying to yourself,” the voice retorted.</p><p>In his own, encouraging voice, Ward reassured Joe, reminding him to hold eye contact, to communicate in strong messages that he was in charge.</p><p>“You’re harder to get hold of today,” the avatar said towards the end of the first session. “You can’t keep it up.”</p><p>“I can keep this up for ever, and I will,” Joe replied. “It’s my life. I have the autonomy here. I’m in control.”</p><p>Joe had 12 weekly sessions. The darkest exchange came in the fourth.</p><p>“You should end it,” the avatar said, casually. “What have you done that’s of any use to anyone?”</p><p>Joe couldn’t answer this.</p><p>In his own voice, Ward interjected to remind Joe about his relationships, his family, the life he had been able to make for himself. “What the avatar is saying is actually not true,” Ward said. “Can you come back with positives?”</p><p>Ward switched back to voicing the avatar. “You agree with me deep down,” it sneered. “You haven’t done anything of use.”</p><p>“No,” Joe said, firmly. “I have a lot of good friendships. I think on balance I have had a good life. It’s been positive. I’ve got more to do.”</p><p>“You’re handling yourself better than I thought,” the avatar replied. “I’d thought you’d be falling apart by now.”</p><hr><p><span>A</span>ll therapy sessions are recorded, and the audio given to the trial participants so they can listen back in their own time and be reminded of how they managed to gain mastery over their voices. With Joe’s agreement, Ward shared the recordings of his sessions with me.</p><p>Ward had delivered avatar therapy to about 80 people before he met Joe. He told me that people with psychosis often feel disempowered and marginalised; they feel as if they don’t have the right to talk. Avatar therapy is about equipping them with the tools to answer back.</p><p>I met Ward in his office at KCL’s Institute of Psychiatry in Denmark Hill, south London. He gave me a demonstration of the avatar design process, so that when we sat down to talk, a disembodied male head was blinking from his laptop in front of us, looking shiftily from side to side throughout our conversation. It still looked like an animated police photofit to me. Perhaps, with a voice to go with it, it would be easier to suspend disbelief.</p><p>Ward told me it can be helpful for many patients to understand their voices as a coping strategy arising from a previous trauma. (While there is no consensus among clinicians about the precise relationship between trauma and hearing voices, there is widespread acceptance that there is often a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/38/4/661/1870563?login=false" data-link-name="in body link">link between the two</a>.) But discovering whether or not a patient’s voices have arisen as a response to trauma isn’t important, Ward told me; the point of the therapy is to find any explanation that gives them a sense of mastery over their voices. This is the principle followed in any psychological intervention, he said.</p><p>Using the manual created from Leff’s instructions as a guide, the therapist plots out how the voice will change as the person is supported to stand up to it. When the voice is a bully, the avatar will begin to recognise the impact of their behaviour, perhaps revealing that they too have once been a victim of bullying. When the voice is a devil, a djinn or some other malevolent spirit, the avatar will reveal that they are not actually very powerful (“‘I’m not a high-ranking demon, I’m a trickster’ – that sort of thing. Things are quite interesting when you voice demons,” Ward said). When the voice resembles someone who abused the patient when the patient was a child, the avatar gradually acknowledges that they are no longer talking to a defenceless boy or girl but instead to an adult with agency.</p><p>Psychiatry professor Al Powers told me he saw potential problems in cases where the voice represented by the avatar belonged to a person who existed in the real world. “That can negatively impact one’s conceptualisation of your relationships with the world, and your family, and other people who are important to you, and that can contain some risks,” he said.</p><p>Before anyone can gain power over their voices, they have to tell their therapist what the voices say to them. It’s often the most degrading content imaginable; racist, sexist, sexually shaming and taboo. In his clinical experience, “You’re a paedophile” is one of the most common phrases repeatedly heard, Ward said. The avatar therapist has to reassure their patient that these phrases are nothing to be ashamed of, but also has to be prepared to deploy them when they are playing the role of avatar.</p><p>For the therapy to work, the therapist has to commit to playing the role of their patient’s tormentor. “You never break the fourth wall,” Ward said. The avatar can be direct – can go for the jugular – <em>because</em> it is not the therapist, and it can lie, or say things that are wrong. Hearing the avatar say these things can give the patient enough distance for them to reflect on and respond to what they usually only hear inside their own head.</p><p>In the Avatar 2 trial, for the first time, therapists went as far as allowing avatars to say things like, “You should end it.” When I brought this up with Ward, he stiffened. This kind of content is only used in specific circumstances, he said, when the patient’s risk of suicide has been assessed as minimal. “You don’t start the first dialogue with that. It comes at a point where you know how the person engages in the dialogue; you know that there is a clinical benefit to [them] voicing a commitment to life, and you know that they will be able to do it.” (I asked three specialists who work on the treatment of psychosis, but were not involved in the trial, about the dangers of the avatar therapist voicing commands to self-harm, and they all told me that, while unconventional, in these circumstances, it would not harm the patient.)</p><p>None of the avatar trials have shown that the therapy could exacerbate psychosis, even if people drop out before they have completed the run of sessions. “People do drop out,” Ward acknowledged. “Sometimes people will say, ‘It was just a bit too much for me.’” They have monitored all the people who had the therapy, tracking any mental health deterioration or hospital admission during and after treatment, and there has been no documented evidence of any crises directly related to avatar therapy during the Avatar 2 trials.</p><p>We are used to imagining those who hear voices as fragile, but Ward sees them as extraordinarily resilient: they can survive both years of the worst kind of internal persecution from their voices, and also the stigma and discrimination their condition is met with by the general public. Nothing simulated on a computer screen could be any more traumatic, he says, than what the people he works with endure in daily life.</p><hr><p><span>B</span>efore and after Joe’s dialogues with the avatar, he and Ward discussed how Joe’s voices might have developed in response to the extreme, heightened terror he had felt during his bad trip. Joe began to think of his voices as an overactive defence mechanism, a maladaptation of his brain as it tried to keep him safe and alert in a world he’d experienced as full of danger.</p><p>“The voices are just your paranoia, your anxiety, your fight-or-flight response gone mad. Give them space, and then you can have a conversation with them,” Joe told me. “I like to think that’s the reason why they started initially, but even if it isn’t, it doesn’t really matter, because it meant I was able to talk to them.”</p><p>By Joe’s seventh session, he was having insightful, poignant conversations with the avatar.</p><p>“Things are going to shit,” it grumbled.</p><p>“It’s not a bad assessment. They aren’t going fantastically,” Joe conceded. “You and I want the same thing – things not to be shit. That’s the goal. Rest assured, we’ll get there. It might take a while.”</p><p>“It’s why you need me.”</p><p>“In a way yeah, I guess. I think we’re working towards the same goal of just being the best version of myself I can be.”</p><p>“That’s what I need from you – to be the best,” the avatar said. “It’s what I’ve always needed.”</p><p>“Yours is not always the most helpful way to go about it, is it?” Joe said. “But I appreciate the sentiment.”</p><p>The dialogue had become a strange kind of couples therapy, in which Ward was playing the avatar and the therapist.</p><p>After four years of arguing with his voice, Joe began to feel compassion – even pity – for his tormentor. In the 10th session, Joe and the avatar discussed what happened in California. Joe described what he went through that night: not only the horror of it (“It was fucking scary, wasn’t it? It felt like a Hitchcock score sounds”) but also the alienation (“I was surrounded by people who found it funny”).</p><p>“You tried to tell yourself it didn’t matter, I wasn’t real,” the avatar said. And then, with resignation, “I’m fading from your life.”</p><p>“You’ll always be there in some form,” Joe reassured it. “But yeah.”</p><p>“Is that OK with you?” it asked. Joe’s tormenting voice had become his anxious companion.</p><p>“Yeah. I can live with that. So long as we’re able to coexist,” he replied.</p><p>“Thank you for listening,” were the avatar’s final words. “Thank you for making room for me.”</p><hr><p><span>A</span>vatar 2 set out to investigate how effective the therapy could be when delivered by therapists with far less experience than Ward and Craig. Some of the participants had been living with voices for decades. Claire was in her early 50s when she enrolled in Avatar 2, at the Manchester research site. She had heard the first voice when she was 10: an adult male, casually telling her to jump out of her bedroom window. It was entirely real to her, external and authoritative, “like an adult telling me what to do”. Claire had been abused from the age of seven. She grew up in a state of constant hypervigilance.</p><p>The nasty voice, the one that told her she was a stupid bitch, arrived when she was 13. “I remember saying, ‘Oh, shut up,’ out loud, and the other girls laughed and said, ‘There’s no one there!’ And then I realised I had to be quiet about them.” The voices became one among many secrets Claire kept, alongside the abuse and her self-harm.</p><p>She spent much of her adult life in psychiatric hospitals. By the time her mental health team’s care coordinator told her about the Avatar 2 trial in 2021, Claire had tried to end her life many times. She had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, psychotic depression and, at one point, schizoaffective disorder. She was taking antidepressants, mood stabilisers and tranquillisers, as well as antipsychotics; she had tried CBT, cognitive analytic therapy, compassion-focused therapy and group survivor therapy. Still the voices persisted.</p><p>“The state I was in at the time, I thought, they’re not going to accept me on the trial – I’m too unstable,” Claire told me. But she was given a place on the trial, coordinated by Hannah Ball. Ball had only qualified as a psychologist a year before she was trained to deliver avatar therapy. She was assigned to be Claire’s therapist. “Hannah reassured me that nobody had ever had a crisis because of avatar therapy, and I thought, <em>that will be me. I’ll be the first one</em>,” Claire said.</p><p>Claire chose to make an avatar out of the first voice, which she felt shaped all the others. While she and Ball were putting together its angular male face, with its dark eyes and spiky hair that made Claire laugh because it wasn’t quite right, the voices over her right shoulder were enraged: “Don’t do this, you stupid fucking bitch.” The avatar’s northern accent was also not quite right, but there was something about its menacing tone that jolted Claire. As soon as she heard it, it was real to her.</p><p>She felt dizzy and sick in her first session, and Ball had to constantly check in to provide reassurance in her own voice. The dialogue lasted barely 10 minutes and left Claire exhausted, but as she walked home, she was smiling: she had been able to stand up to her voices for the first time in her life. Between sessions, she listened to the audio recordings that Ball had given her to take home, so she could remember what she had achieved and steel herself for her next encounter. (Claire agreed to share these recordings with me.)</p><p>By the third week, she was answering back to the avatar, asserting herself without any prompting from her therapist.</p><p>“Stop saying such nasty things to me. I’m not going to listen to you any more while you say such nasty things,” she told the avatar.</p><p>“I’m not sure what’s got into you,” it replied.</p><p>“I’m going to lay down some rules,” Claire said. “We can still talk, but on my terms, not yours.”</p><p>By the fourth week, Claire’s voices had gone entirely. For the first time in 40 years, she was alone with her own thoughts. Quiet.</p><p>She hadn’t expected them to go. “My aim wasn’t to get rid of them – just to get along with them,” she told me. “I wasn’t quite sure I wanted to let go. I’d never really been on my own. As abusive as it was, it’s still a relationship.”</p><p>Like Joe, she had been encouraged to understand her voices as a faulty self-defence mechanism. They had been trying to look after her: when they told her to end her life, they were trying to find a way to stop her suffering. Their departure was a kind of bereavement.</p><figure id="c77b1fdc-b178-46b7-9399-9bb77acb1aee" data-spacefinder-role="immersive" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd4e67816d6336c959173f32e58b3ffe0679140/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd4e67816d6336c959173f32e58b3ffe0679140/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd4e67816d6336c959173f32e58b3ffe0679140/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1140&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd4e67816d6336c959173f32e58b3ffe0679140/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1140&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd4e67816d6336c959173f32e58b3ffe0679140/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1125&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd4e67816d6336c959173f32e58b3ffe0679140/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1125&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd4e67816d6336c959173f32e58b3ffe0679140/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=965&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 740px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 740px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd4e67816d6336c959173f32e58b3ffe0679140/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=965&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 740px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd4e67816d6336c959173f32e58b3ffe0679140/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=725&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd4e67816d6336c959173f32e58b3ffe0679140/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=725&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd4e67816d6336c959173f32e58b3ffe0679140/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=645&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd4e67816d6336c959173f32e58b3ffe0679140/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=645&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd4e67816d6336c959173f32e58b3ffe0679140/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd4e67816d6336c959173f32e58b3ffe0679140/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="AI Avatars Long Read | Illustration 03 | DIGITAL" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd4e67816d6336c959173f32e58b3ffe0679140/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="465" height="279" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span> Illustration: Nick Kempton</figcaption></figure><p>In the remaining sessions, Ball helped Claire accept the loss of the voices, and she had an opportunity to say a definitive goodbye. The avatar promised to stay alongside her at a distance, there if needed, but no longer interfering in her life. “I wish you all the best,” it said at the end of the final session.</p><p>“Thank you. I wish you all the best, too,” Claire replied. “I know you had good intentions at heart.”</p><p>Nearly two years on, Claire’s voices have not returned. She’s coming off all her medications. She can go out in public, eat in a noisy restaurant, do voluntary work, give interviews to a journalist – all things that once seemed impossible. “I’m stronger. I’ve gained so much. I now feel I have a life worth living.”</p><p>Ball didn’t have the same level of experience as Leff, Craig or Ward, but she was able to achieve the same outcomes using the manual they developed as her guide. I asked to see the manual, but Ward told me he couldn’t share it with me, because it was “core IP”. The Wellcome Trust, which funds the trial, has been protective of its intellectual property in the past: research teams in Denmark, Australia and Canada that have been experimenting with avatars have been told there are restrictions around calling the work “avatar therapy”.</p><p>Ball told me the manual is not a script, more a set of objectives to aim for in each session: a general structure of how the avatar should change to empower the patient. She listened to recordings of one of Ward’s cases from the first trial, did two closely supervised pilot cases and was then delivering the therapy herself, alone.</p><p>I wondered how comfortable she felt, taking on the role of a malevolent entity that has enormous power over her patient. “It requires a lot of active formulation and reformulation on the spot, and listening out for things that might change how you were initially going to approach a dialogue,” she said.</p><p>I had imagined that only skilled clinicians could be avatar therapists, but Ball was convinced that, if they were willing to take on the challenge, a very wide range of mental health practitioners could do it. “I think you need people who understand relationships and dynamics,” she said. “If you’ve got a sense of who you are as the avatar and the relationship [to the patient], you know how to respond.”</p><hr><p><span>T</span>he results of the Avatar 2 trial, published on Monday, were dramatic. Avatar therapy has been shown to deliver rapid and significant reduction in distress caused by voices. No other psychological intervention has been shown to cause such a significant reduction in the frequency of intrusive voices.</p><p>Earlier this year, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence announced that it has found avatar therapy to be safe and effective and recommended that it be offered for testing in clinical NHS settings over the next three years. Thirty-eight people have so far been trained to deliver it in the UK, from experienced clinicians to newly qualified psychologists and nurses. The most effective psychological therapy currently offered on the NHS, CBTp, is typically delivered by qualified clinical psychologists in 16 sessions over 12 months. In comparison, avatar therapy could work out as “half the length of time, with less skilled people, so a bit cheaper, and a bit more available”, Tom Craig told me. He hopes it will be part of NHS treatment within five years.</p><p>A small number of practitioners remain hesitant about avatar therapy being delivered by support workers and less experienced psychologists. Prof Neil Thomas, director of the Voices clinic in Melbourne, and lead investigator on the Australian Amethyst avatar therapy trial, said: “Working with people who hear voices is <em>already</em> an area of specialist practice. Using technology as well makes it even more specialist. The process is actually not particularly intuitive for people that have trained in therapy – which involves being supportive to people – to have to role play a nasty voice.”</p><p>But the British team are taking things even further. A newly announced Avatar 3 trial will investigate whether the avatar could be entirely digital and voiced by an artificial intelligence, which would remove the requirement for real-time human voicing of the avatar, and mean it could be widely disseminated. Humans would always be necessary to support the person in their interaction with the avatar and help make meaning of the voices, Craig said, but that would not need to be a trained therapist. It could be “a community nurse, or a nursing assistant”.</p><p>Louise Birkedal Glenthøj, associate professor of psychology at University of Copenhagen and the trial coordinator for Challenge, the Danish trial using avatars in the treatment of psychosis, told me she feared a fully digital avatar powered by AI might have the potential to exacerbate psychosis. “As people with psychosis struggle with grasping reality,” she said, “being in a dialogue with a machine that is not controlled by a therapist might generate psychotic experiences.”</p><p>The Danish team enrolled 270 participants in a trial that investigated how people who hear voices respond to having dialogues with an avatar using virtual reality. “We thought if [we could] integrate this in fully immersive VR, then we would perhaps get some additional benefit in terms of this potentially having a greater treatment effect,” Glenthøj told me. <em>“</em>Having the therapist close by would intuitively be more secure for the patient. We capitalise on this notion of ‘it’s real but it’s not real’. It’s so real that they feel they are in this dialogue with their voice, but it’s not real, and if they take off the headset, then it’s gone.”</p><p>The VR allows the user to situate the avatar in daily life settings, such as on the bus, or in the participant’s home. They also added emotions to the face, so the avatar could smile more and look more friendly as the dialogues progress.</p><p>Glenthøj conceded that VR avatar therapy can be overwhelming for some. “We <em>do </em>see people reacting. They destabilise. They get <em>more</em> psychotic.” As a result, the Danish team progressed more slowly than clinicians on the Avatar 2 trial, and have added safety features, such as a virtual panic button, and regular contact with the participants’ primary care providers throughout treatment. They also gave participants booster sessions at three and six months after treatment, in the hope of making any positive effects more durable. The <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5180922/v1" data-link-name="in body link">trial ultimately found</a> that VR avatar therapy was significantly more effective at reducing voices compared with supportive counselling.</p><p>Avatar therapy may help in treating mental health conditions beyond psychosis. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40337-023-00900-1" data-link-name="in body link">Preliminary research</a> from Ward’s team with an avatar embodying the “anorexic voice” has shown it to be a promising intervention for eating disorders. Glenthøj is researching VR-based avatar therapy for obsessive compulsive disorder. Ward also wants to investigate whether dialogues with avatars could help people who struggle with anxiety or depression. “The technology is about creating this external representation of the dark side of yourself,” Craig said. “At some level, this is about thoughts, isn’t it?”</p><p>In Australia, avatar therapy can take place via telehealth, with therapist and participant often in different parts of the country. “We’ve got a lot of people living in regional areas who have limited access to mental healthcare – let alone to specialist therapies,” Thomas told me. They have drawn on how the British team worked during lockdown to see how it can be delivered remotely.</p><p>Some therapists have tried, in the past, to guide their patients through dialogue with voices via role play, or “chair work” – where the voices are represented by an empty chair with content spoken by the patient – but both these techniques require a leap of faith. With an avatar, it’s the recreation of the voice, not the face, that makes this radical, Thomas said. “It’s called avatar therapy, and that sounds like it’s primarily about the visual representation, but not everyone has an existing image that goes with their voice. I think the auditory transformation is particularly powerful.”</p><p>“The suspension of disbelief is remarkable,” Craig told me. Even though trial participants have signed consent forms and know it is the therapist voicing the avatar, they still relate to it as if it were the voice in their head. “They are put in front of this not very wonderful computer animation, and they’re <em>right in there</em>, talking to their voice.”</p><hr><p><span>‘I</span>t was liberating just to talk to Tom [Ward] about it, because I didn’t speak to anyone else,” Joe told me over coffee in south London. He still had the imposing presence of a rugby player, but he was so softly spoken that I had to strain to hear him talk over the hubbub of the cafe.</p><figure id="a0a9aad5-ad1d-46dc-bd41-dd6cc1c71ae2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:108,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Therapy wars: the revenge of Freud | Oliver Burkeman&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;a0a9aad5-ad1d-46dc-bd41-dd6cc1c71ae2&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jan/07/therapy-wars-revenge-of-freud-cognitive-behavioural-therapy&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:1,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>A year on from avatar therapy, Joe’s voice was still there, a presence just out of eyeshot, still a distinct external entity and not just an inner monologue. But it was quieter, easier to manage and allowed him to get on with daily life. When it spoke, it was to have the same kind of conversations they’d had in his final sessions with the avatar. “I get it – you’re very on edge,” Joe would tell his voice. “I don’t feel great either. But we are just walking to work at the moment. I promise, we’re good.”</p><p>“It worked because I understood the voices more, I think,” he told me. “My general levels of anxiety stayed pretty high, but I’ve started interpreting the hallucinations as a part of the anxiety.” He still has panic attacks. The anxiety and self-doubt that existed before his bad trip are still there. “You do have to address everything that’s going on to address the voices themselves. They feed on everything else.”</p><p>Joe recently went back to his GP in search of help with his anxiety, but there was no cutting-edge experimental solution delivered by renowned psychologists for him this time. The GP put him on a waiting list for NHS talking therapy, and warned that he could be in for a very long wait.</p><p><em>Names of patients have been changed. </em></p><p><em><span data-dcr-style="bullet"></span> </em>In the UK and Ireland, <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/" data-link-name="in body link">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.org" data-link-name="in body link | mailto:jo@samaritans.org">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.ie" data-link-name="in body link | mailto:jo@samaritans.ie">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>In forums relating to AI and AI coding in particular, I see a common inquiry
from experienced software developers: <em>Is anyone getting value out of tools like
Cursor, and is it worth the subscription price?</em></p>
<p>A few months into using Cursor as my daily driver for both personal and work
projects, I have some observations to share about whether this is a
"need-to-have" tool or just a passing fad, as well as strategies to get the most
benefit quickly which may help you if you'd like to trial it. Some of you may
have tried Cursor and found it underwhelming, and maybe some of these
suggestions might inspire you to give it another try.</p>
<p>I am not sponsored by Cursor, and I am not a product reviewer. I am neither
championing nor dunking on this as a product, but rather sharing my own
experience with it.</p>
<p><strong>Who am I, and who is the audience for this article?</strong></p>
<p>I have been writing code for 36 years in a number of languages, but
professionally focused on C-heavy computer game engines and Go/Python/JS web
development. I am expecting readers to be similarly reasonably comfortable and
productive working in large codebases, writing and debugging code in their
chosen language, etc. I would give very different advice to novices who might
want an AI to teach them programming concepts or write code for them that is way
beyond their level!</p>
<p>For me, the appeal of an AI copilot is in taking care of boilerplate and
repetitive tasks for me so I can focus on the interesting logic for any given
problem. I am also not especially interested in cranking out large quantities of
code automatically; I am highly skeptical of "lines of code written" as an
efficiency metric. I would prefer to spend less time writing the same amount of
code and more time thinking through edge cases, maintainability, etc.</p>
<p>So, without further ado:</p>
<h2>What is Cursor?</h2>
<p>Cursor<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> is a fork of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) which has Large Language Model (LLM)
powered features integrated into the core UI. It is a proprietary product with a
free tier and a subscription option; however, the pricing sheet doesn't cover
what the actual subscriber benefits are and how they compare to competing
products. I'll try to clarify that when discussing the features below based on
my own understanding, but a quick summary:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tab completion</strong>: This is a set of proprietary fine-tuned models that both
  provide code completion in the editor, as well as navigate to the next
  recommended action, all triggered by the Tab key. Only available to subscribers.</li>
<li><strong>Inline editing</strong>: This is a chat-based interface for making edits to
  selected code with a simple diff view using a foundation model such as GPT or
  Claude. Available to free and paid users.</li>
<li><strong>Chat sidebar</strong>: This is also a chat-based interface for making larger edits
  in a sidebar view, allowing more room for longer discussion, code sample
  suggestions across multiple files, etc. using a foundation model such as GPT
  or Claude. Available to free and paid users.</li>
<li><strong>Composer</strong>: This is yet another chat-based interface specifically meant for
  larger cross-codebase refactors, generating diffs for multiple files that you
  can page through and approve, also using a foundation model such as GPT or Claude.
  Available to free and paid users.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tab completion</h2>
<p>While other LLM-powered coding tools focus on a chat experience, so far in my
usage of Cursor it's the tab completion that fits most naturally into my
day-to-day practice of coding and saves the most time. A lot of thought and
technical research has apparently gone into this feature, so that it can not
only suggest completions for a line, several lines, or a whole function, but it
can also suggest the next line to go to for the next edit. What this amounts to
is being able to make part of a change, and then auto-complete related changes
throughout the entire file just by repeatedly pressing Tab.</p>
<p>One way to use this is as a code refactoring tool on steroids. For example,
suppose I have a block of code with variable names in <code>under_score</code> notation
that I want to convert to <code>camelCase</code>. It is sufficient to rename one instance
of one variable, and then tab through all the lines that should be updated,
including the other related variables. Many tedious, error-prone tasks can be
automated in this way without having to write a script to do so:</p>

  </p>
</video>

<p>Sometimes tab completion will indepedently find a bug and propose a fix. Many
times it will suggest imports when I add a dependency in Python or Go. If I wrap
a string in quotes, it will escape the contents appropriately. And, as with
other tools, it can write whole functions based on just the function signature
and optional docstring:</p>

  </p>
</video>

<p>All in all, this tool feels like it is reading my mind, guessing at my next
action, and allowing me to think less about the code and more about the
architecture of I am building.</p>
<p>Also worth noting: The completions are <em>incredibly fast</em>, and I never felt a delay
waiting for a suggestion. They appear basically as soon as I stop typing. Having
too long a wait would surely be a deal-breaker for me.</p>
<p>So, what are my complaints with Tab completion? One is a minor annoyance:
Sometimes I don't see the suggestion in time and continue typing, and the
completion disappears. Once it is gone, there doesn't appear to be any way to
get it to come back, so I have to type something else and hope.</p>
<p>My other complaint is the exact opposite situation: Sometimes a completion is
dead wrong, and I intentionally dismiss it. Subsequently, but very infrequently,
I will accept a totally different completion and the previously-declined
suggestion will quietly be applied as well. This has already caused some
hard-to-track-down bugs because I wasn't aware the wrong logic had been
accepted. I haven't found these cases to be frequent enough to cancel out the
productivity boost of tab completion, but they do detract from it.</p>
<h2>Inline editing, chat sidebar, and composer</h2>
<p>As far as I can tell, these features are all very similar in their interaction
with a foundational model - I use Claude 3.5 Sonnet almost exclusively - and the
variance is in the user interface.</p>
<p>Inline editing can be invoked by selecting some code and pressing Ctrl-K/Cmd-K.
I type in the desired changes, and get a nice diff in the file that I can accept
or reject. I use this mostly to implement bits of code inside a function or make
minor refactors.</p>
<p>A good example of where this works great is if I have a loop over some tasks and
I want to parallelize them:</p>

  </p>
</video>

<p>The chat sidebar is opened with Ctrl+L/Cmd+L, and gives more real estate for a
multi-turn conversation, though one pet peeve I have with the LLM models I've
tested so far is they will <em>always</em> return code first, rather than ask for
clarification if there is any ambiguity. The suggested code has an Apply button
that will create a diff in the currently selected file. This is useful for
larger refactors within a single file, or creating a brand new file based on the
file I have open. If additional files are relevant they can be added manually to
the context, but Cursor will try to guess which files are relevant based on the
query and an index it generates in the background.</p>
<p>Here is an example which takes an application's database API and creates a REST
API to access it, with parameter validation and correct HTTP status codes,
<em>then</em> writes a client library to access that REST API:</p>

  </p>
</video>

<p>As another example, here I am using the chat sidebar to convert the client
library from Python to Go. Note how the loosely-typed Python is converted to
well-defined struct types and idiomatic Go including error handling! This is not
a 1:1 rewrite at all:</p>

  </p>
</video>

<p>Finally, Composer is specifically meant for cross-file refactors. This is also
the feature I use least, but provides a better user experience for reviewing
multiple file diffs one at a time.</p>
<h2>.cursorrules file</h2>
<p>I did not realize this feature existed until I came across it in the (in my
opinion too minimal) documentation, but the various chat modalities always
include the contents of a <code>.cursorrules</code> file located at the root of the
workspace to provide additional context. I've been experimenting with using this
to inform the LLM of the repository's coding standards, common packages, and
other documentation.</p>
<p>This feature might help to solve one of the big roadblocks I have observed with
Cursor: It does not follow coding styles and patterns unless they already exist
in the same file you are editing. For example, at Khan Academy we use a
proprietary library <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> for passing context between functions in Go. This is
used for logging, HTTP requests, etc. so the LLM needs to be able to use it.
This has been difficult in the past, but perhaps a well-written <code>.cursorrules</code>
is a good first step.</p>
<p>One current limitation is that there is only one of these files per workspace,
so a monorepo like ours containing code in multiple languages is going to be
more difficult to set up than a small repository with a small set of very
consistently styled code.</p>
<p>Also the documentation suggests that the <code>.cursorrules</code> file is only used for
the chat modalities, not the tab completion. However I've experimented with
having that file open in a pinned tab in the workspace and confirmed that it is
possible to include it in the tab completion context that way at least.</p>
<h2>Changes to my workflow</h2>
<p>The most exciting thing about a tool like Cursor is not that I can write code
faster, because honestly the actual writing of code is not the bottleneck; in
fact, I often have to slow myself down to avoid focusing too much on the code
and not enough on the high-level problem being solved. The real value is in
changing <em>how</em> I code.</p>
<p>It's still early days with this technology, but this is what I've found has
changed about how I work and what I expect to see changing in the near future:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I am <em>much</em> less likely to reach for a new library or a framework. No, I'm
not going to start writing my own crypto libraries, but for small utilities it's
easy enough to let the LLM write them to my bespoke needs than to pull in a
general-purpose library. These libraries tend to start small and lightweight and
then, because they are open and used by many people, accumulate functionality
and cruft that I don't need.</p>
<p>Many of these libraries only exist to reduce boilerplate, which felt like a
necessary tradeoff when balanced against my time writing and maintaining that
boilerplate but now that I can have the LLM do it for me it feels less worth the
cost. And the cost can be substantial: Have you tried getting a Node.js project
running a year or more after it was written? You may as well start from scratch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also worry less about adhering to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) in my own code.
Prematurely defining abstractions can create a lot of technical debt later on,
so being able to create a lot of code with reference to other code without
trying to pull it into a function or class allows me more flexibility, and I
know that if I have to refactor shared logic out later, the LLM can help with
that too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My willingness to use a language or framework I am less familiar with is much
higher. For example, I've dabbled in R for years, especially for visualizing
data. However, to be frank, I suck at it. I don't have a deep understanding of
<code>dplyr</code> and it seems like there are always a dozen different ways to accomplish
the same task. Now I describe the visualization I want, and I get correct data
manipulation and <code>ggplot</code> visualization for it. Tasks that took an hour or more
now take five minutes, so I am much less likely to give up and do it in Python
instead.</p>
<p>Maybe one of these days I'll even write something in Rust. Maybe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I find myself iterating quickly on small components before integrating them
into the larger codebase. This is partly to work around the limitations of LLMs
when working with larger codebases, but it also opens up interesting ways of
working I hadn't considered before. As per the example above, I can prototype
some logic in a dynamically typed language like Python, work out the technical
details and then convert it to well-typed Go instantly to integrate into a web
application. I can have the LLM generate test data automatically, or mock up a
backend for me to write a frontend against. Why pay the tax of working in a
mature codebase while I'm still proving out an idea?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Whether I'll be using Cursor in a few years or have moved on to another tool, I
can't really tell. I am confident that at the time of writing this, Cursor is
the best example of the potential of LLM coding assistants, and if you want to
explore how this type of tool might be of value I suggest you give it a spin.</p>

In many ways, your world is small. Your four delicate wings, each less than a centimeter long, transport your half-gram body through looming landscapes full of giant animals and plants. In other ways, your world is expansive, even grand. Your five eyes see colors and patterns that humans can’t, and your multisensory antennae detect odors from distant flowers.</p><p>For years, biologists have wondered whether bees have another grand sense that we lack. The static electricity they accumulate by flying—similar to the charge generated when you shuffle across carpet in thick socks—could be potent enough for them to sense and influence surrounding objects through the air. Aquatic animals such as eels, sharks, and dolphins are known to sense electricity in water, which is an excellent conductor of charge. By contrast, air is a poor conductor. But it may relay enough to influence living things and their evolution.</p><p>In 2013, <a data-offer-url="https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/daniel-robert" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/daniel-robert&quot;}" href="https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/daniel-robert" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Daniel Robert</a>, a sensory ecologist at the University of Bristol in England, broke ground in this discipline when his lab discovered that bees can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1230883" target="_blank">detect and discriminate</a> among electric fields radiating from flowers. Since then, more experiments have documented that spiders, ticks, and other bugs can perform a similar trick.</p><p>This animal static impacts ecosystems. Parasites, such as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2023.06.021" target="_blank">ticks</a> and <a data-offer-url="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR23/Session/B08.1" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR23/Session/B08.1&quot;}" href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR23/Session/B08.1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">roundworms</a>, hitch rides on electric fields generated by larger animal hosts. In a behavior known as ballooning, spiders <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.05.057" target="_blank">take flight</a> by extending a silk thread to catch charges in the sky, sometimes traveling hundreds of kilometers with the wind. And this year, studies from Robert’s lab revealed how static <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2024.0156" target="_blank">attracts pollen</a> to butterflies and moths, and may help caterpillars to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2322674121" target="_blank">evade predators</a>.</p><p>This new research goes beyond documenting the ecological effects of static: It also aims to uncover whether and how evolution has fine-tuned this electric sense. Electrostatics may turn out to be an evolutionary force in small creatures’ survival that helps them find food, migrate, and infest other living things.</p><figure><p><span>Daniel Robert studies animal biophysics at the University of Bristol.

Though we cannot sense these electric trails, they may guide us to animal behaviors we never imagined.</p><h2>Electrostatic Discoveries</h2><p>In 2012, <a data-offer-url="https://ornithopterus.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://ornithopterus.com/&quot;}" href="https://ornithopterus.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Víctor Ortega-Jiménez</a> stumbled into electrostatics while playing with his 4-year-old daughter. They were using a toy wand that gathers static charge to levitate lightweight objects, such as a balloon. When they decided to test it outside, he made a startling observation.</p><figure><p><span>Studies by Víctor Ortega-Jiménez of the University of California, Berkeley revealed that a negatively charged spiderweb attracts positively charged insect prey.</span><span>Photograph: Courtesy of Víctor Ortega-Jiménez</span></p></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“My daughter put the wand close to a spiderweb, and it reacted very quickly,” recalled Ortega-Jiménez, who studies the biomechanics of animal travel at the University of California, Berkeley. The wand attracted the web. He immediately began to draw connections to his research about the strange ways insects interact with their environments.</p><p>All matter—wands, balloons, webs, air—strives for balance between its positive and negative particles (protons, electrons and ions). At an unfathomably small scale, Ortega-Jiménez’s toy buzzes with an imbalance: A motor draws negative charges inward, forcing positive charges to the wand’s surface. This is static. It’s like when you rub a balloon against your head. Friction sheds electrons from your hair to the rubber, loading it up with static charge, so that when you lift the balloon, strands of hair float with it.</p><p>In a similar way, Ortega-Jiménez considered, friction from beating insect wings could shed negative charges from body to air, leaving the insects with a positive charge while creating regions of negative static. He realized that if a web carries negative charge and insects a positive one, then a spiderweb might not just be a passive trap—it could move toward and attract its quarry electrostatically. His lab experiments revealed precisely that. Webs <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/srep02108" target="_blank">deformed instantly</a> when jolted with static from flies, aphids, honeybees, and even water droplets. Spiders caught charged insects more easily. He saw how static electricity altered the physics of animal interactions.</p><p>The magic of animal electrostatics is all about size. Large animals don’t meaningfully experience nature’s static—we’re too big to feel it. “As humans, we are living mostly in a gravitational or fluid-dynamics world,” Ortega-Jiménez said. But for tiny beings, gravity is an afterthought. Insects can feel air’s viscosity. While the same laws of physics reign over Earth’s smallest and largest species, the balance of forces shifts with size. Intermolecular forces flex beneath the feet of water striders on a pond, capillary forces shoot water impossibly upward through a plant’s thin roots, and electrostatic forces can ensnare any oppositely charged flecks that lie in their path.</p><figure><p><span>A parasitic nematode twirls through the air, pulled toward its electrostatically charged insect host (top). Tiny particles make the electrostatic field visible (bottom).</span><span>Images: Courtesy of Víctor Ortega-Jiménez</span></p></figure><p>“Charged fleck” is an apt physical description of a pollen grain. A few years after Ortega-Jiménez noticed spiderwebs nabbing bugs, Robert’s team found that bees can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00359-017-1176-6" target="_blank">gather negatively charged pollen</a> without brushing up against it. When a bee drank nectar from a flower, the pollen shot right onto its body. “There was no contact required between the bee and the flower for that pollen to jump,” Robert said. “This is a trajectory that responds to electrostatic forces.”</p><p>The discovery suggested to Robert that electrostatics can enable a plant-pollinator mutualism, a well-known example of coevolution. This dynamic—in which a bee feeds on a flower’s nectar and gathers pollen to feed larvae, and also propagates pollen from flower to flower, enabling plant reproduction—was already well established. The potential role of static charge was brand-new.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Over the past decade, Robert has built a body of work that reveals the many ways insects and arachnids use and experience static. Ticks jump, spiders balloon, bees sense the negative charge of a flower recently visited by another positively charged bee. He even found that the charged relationship between air and insects goes both ways: Honeybee swarms shed so many negative charges that they <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2022.105241" target="_blank">alter the electrical gradient</a> around them. Based on Robert’s estimates, the atmospheric charge resulting from a swarm of desert locusts rivals that of clouds and electrical storms.</p><figure><p><span>Illustration: Mark Belan/<em>Quanta Magazine</em></span></p></figure><p>Robert’s and Ortega-Jiménez’s conclusions were provocative. But to them, the physics of arthropods makes electrostatic forces inevitable. Bugs are light and angular with a high ratio of surface area to volume—“all these parameters that physicists can tell you call for higher charge density,” Robert said. “It turns out that their world is way more electrical than ours.”</p><p>Still, the experiments couldn’t conclude that the creatures control this electrostatic function, or how it evolved—if it even did evolve. Robert wondered: Is the use of static fields by bugs coincidental or adaptive?</p><h2>Static for Survival</h2><p>Sam England wears his love of nature on his sleeve. He has half a dozen animal tattoos, including a treehopper decorated with the planets of our solar system—an homage to his background in physics. The marriage of these worlds drives his curiosity: How does physics mold animal behavior? He pivoted to sensory ecology for graduate school and joined Robert’s lab at the University of Bristol to chase the hypothesis that insects actively use static to affect their environments.</p><figure><p><span>To measure the static charge carried by butterflies and moths, Sam England tied fishing line to each flier and “walked” them through a metal loop.</span><span>Photograph: Courtesy of Rebecca Ward</span></p></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Because the electrostatic world is invisible to human researchers, its forces are hard to study, even before you add unpredictable creatures to the mix. “Doing research in biology can be so much harder than physics because you have to rely on live animals to do something,” England said. He wanted to test whether Lepidoptera, the order of flying insects that includes butterflies and moths, build up enough static during flight to collect pollen from the flowers they visit for nectar, as bees do. But first he had to rig up a way to measure the insects’ static charge.</p><p>A “walk” is England’s best analogy for his method of tricking the insects into staying airborne for 30 seconds. “I had to tie little lassos around their waists,” he said. He leashed each flier with fishing line and coaxed them through a metal loop fixed to measure their charge.</p><p>England studied 11 species of butterflies and moths native to various climates, ecosystems, and lifestyles. After they flew around their cages for 30 seconds—enough time to accumulate electrostatic charge—he guided them through the loop. All 11 species charged up during flight. Some reached static charge of around 5 kilovolts per meter—enough to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2024.0156" target="_blank">yank negatively charged pollen</a> from 6 millimeters away, he calculated.</p><p>When lepidopterans land directly on a flower, pollen naturally sticks to their bodies. If static charge causes pollen to skip across air gaps, “it’s going to increase their efficiency as pollinators,” England said. “It makes it more likely that pollination will occur.”</p><p>To gauge static’s evolutionary significance, he looked for patterns in how the animals’ behavior in the wild correlates with their electrical charge. He found a few. For example, nocturnal moths tend to hold less charge than other species. Why? It’s possible, England speculates, that strong charges make insects more visible to predators that rely on nonvisual cues, such as static, at night. Minimizing charge could therefore help the moths survive.</p><div data-testid="feature-large-callout"><figure><p><span>New research studied static charge on 11 butterflies and moths, including the hawk moth (left) and peacock butterfly (right).

He cautioned that the study’s 11 species are a modest representation of the world’s 180,000 or so lepidopterans. “For claiming electrostatic adaptation, it needs to be more broad. But it’s a good hypothesis.”</p><p>For insects to act on static information, they must be able to detect electrical fields. Microscopic hairs on bees and spiders seem to aid in sensing, according to work from Robert’s lab. England recently expanded this unresolved science by studying how the minuscule hairs of caterpillars deflect under static, to glean how electric information may help a caterpillar survive.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>When England’s team exposed caterpillars to electric fields similar to those generated by a flying wasp, caterpillars <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2322674121" target="_blank">displayed defensive behaviors</a> such as coiling, flailing, or biting. “This basically insinuates,” England said, that “prey and predator can detect each other just using static electricity.”</p><p>Dornhaus, the behavioral ecologist, questioned whether electroreception buys the caterpillar much time. Yet the high stakes of predator-prey conflict suggest that any advantage may count. “For the individual caterpillar, even just getting a small increase in the chance of surviving that encounter makes it an evolutionarily relevant behavior,” she said.</p><p>“Organisms are always opportunists,” said Ortega-Jiménez, who is hesitant but impressed by England’s research. He is eager for more data—ideally from wild animals—that examines naturalistic behaviors. “Who is winning this game? Who is taking more advantage of electrostatics?” he asked. “What kinds of predator and prey?”</p><div data-testid="feature-large-callout"><figure><p><span>A caterpillar of a cinnabar moth coils in a defensive posture.

England</span></p></figure></div><p>As more evidence links static to survival, a story is emerging that evolution may fine-tune the capacity to sense or carry charge just like any other trait. “The fact that there’s such a diverse range of species with different ecologies is what makes it so interesting,” said Beth Harris, a graduate student in Robert’s lab. “There’s a real treasure chest to be opened.”</p><h2>Electrical Inheritance</h2><p>As work continues in Robert’s lab, the suspicion that static detection and accumulation among insects and arachnids is no accident does as well. Caterpillars with better electroreception, or nocturnal moths that carry lower charge, may better dodge predators. If they survive to reproduce more, those genes and traits—including those that help organisms sense and use static fields—could become stronger and more common in generations down the line.</p><p>It’s starting to become impossible to ignore the idea that electrostatics may be more influential in the animal kingdom than we know today. Whole ecosystems may depend on hidden electric fields. “If you suddenly took away electrostatics, I don’t think you’d get a mass extinction,” England said. “But I think we’d be surprised by how many animals would have to adapt to not using it.”</p><p>Electrostatic forces act on a scale of millimeters and centimeters, but their collective impact could be much larger. For instance, social bees such as bumblebees collect food for other colony members and larvae. Foragers make hundreds of decisions about flowers every day, and many other bees depend on those decisions. “What we think of as a fairly subtle difference on an individual level—being able to detect the flower just a second faster—could be quite significant for them evolutionarily,” said Dornhaus, who studies how bees interact with flowers.</p><p>If static charges aid pollination, they could shift plant evolution too. “Maybe some fundamental features of flowers are actually just in service of generating the correct electrostatic field,” Dornhaus said, “and because we can’t see them, we’ve ignored that whole dimension of a flower’s life.” The idea isn’t so far-fetched: In 2021, Robert’s team observed petunias releasing more <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00114-021-01740-2" target="_blank">compounds that attract bugs</a> around beelike electric fields. This suggests that flowers wait until a pollinator is nearby to actively lure them closer, Robert said.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“Humans are very visually oriented, so we tend to emphasize flowers that are showy and large,” Dornhaus said. But we already know that flowers transmit strong invisible signals, like scents or ultraviolet patterns. “It may well be that for some flowers, the electric field is actually a more prominent signal to bees than color is.”</p><p>However, evolutionary details surrounding electrostatic ecology remain murky at best. “It’s amazing, really, how little we know,” said Wainwright, the insect evolutionary ecologist. Even within better-understood visual and acoustic systems, ecologists are only beginning to connect evolutionary dots.</p><p>Because electrostatics has flown under the radar, England worries that humans unknowingly hinder the ability of animals to use these forces. “We’re spitting electrostatic stuff into the environment all the time,” he said. Electronic devices, appliances, power lines, fertilizers, and even clothing bear static charges. “If [insects are] sensitive to the wingbeat of a wasp, they’re probably sensitive to a power line, and it might be messing up that entire system.”</p><p>Since completing his doctoral work, England now studies animal vision as a postdoctoral researcher with Berlin’s Natural History Museum. He hopes to one day run his own lab to explore these conservation questions and discover new cases of aerial electroreception or electrostatic behaviors, such as mating.</p><p>“The dream would be that aerial electrostatic sensing is well known and considered to be a regular part of the sensory repertoire of animals,” he said. Realizing that dream will take more research that seeks out the evolutionary secrets of critters far smaller than us, and thereby enlarges our world.</p><hr><p><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-hidden-world-of-electrostatic-ecology-20240930/"><em>Original story</em></a> <em>reprinted with permission from</em> <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/">Quanta Magazine</a>, <em>an editorially independent publication of the</em> <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/"><em>Simons Foundation</em></a> <em>whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In the 1950s, computers did not really interoperate. ARPANET has not yet happened (that would become a thing in the 60s), and every operating system was typically tied to the hardware that was meant to run on. Most communication actually happened over telephone, and no company was more present in that space than the Bell System. Unfortunately, the way they were so present was through exclusive supply contracts (with its subsidiary Western Electric) and a vast array of patents that it would refuse to license to competitors. So they got an antitrust suit aimed at them, which after seven years of litigation culminated in the 1956 consent decree. The Bell System was broken up, obliged to license all of its patents royalty-free, and barred from entering any industry other than telecommunications. So they made Unix.</p>
<p>Unix was unique, because the focus was on the software (since Bell couldn’t compete in this space anyway, as per the above). An evolution of Multics, it was developed on a PDP-7 (by cross-compiling). They then ported a compiler-compiler to it, leading to the development of B. Once their internal needs outgrew the PDP-7, it got ported to the PDP-11, and gained full typesetting capabilities. Gaining some traction internally, when Bell acquired other PDP-11s, instead of running DEC’s own OS for the machine, they simply ran Unix on it. This has led to the rewrite of the OS in C, a higher level (comparatively, of course) language, which enabled the porting of it to other machines (like the Interdata 7/32 and 8/32). Interest grew, and Bell (not being allowed to turn Unix into a product) simply shipped it at manufacturing cost for the media. Notably, ARPANET used it (see: RFC 681).</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, Unix had become a univeral operating system, used on virtually every serious machine. Then, AT&amp;T got hit by an antitrust suit again. The exact details matter less, but freed it from the old restriction. System V immediately turned into a product, almost killing it. That very year, the GNU project was created, and the BSD project was started in Berkeley. Having grown accustomed to interoperability (since up until that point, there was only really one serious Unix), several standardization attempts were created. The System V Interface Definition was the AT&amp;T one, Europe created the X/Open consortium of Single UNIX Specification fame, and the IEEE put out POSIX. These latter two would eventually merge and become equivalent, developed by the Austin Group, defining the only interface said to be universally interoperable on the OS level that we have to this day.</p>
<p>As of the previous release of POSIX, the Austin Group gained more control over the specification, having it be more working group oriented, and they got to work making the POSIX specification more modern. POSIX 2024 is the first release that bears the fruits of this labor, and as such, the changes made to it are particularly interesting, as they will define the direction of the specification going forwards. This is what this article is about!</p>
<p>Well, mostly. POSIX is composed of a couple of sections. Notably XBD (Base Definitions, which talk about things like what a file is, how regular expressions work, etc), XSH (System Interfaces, the C API that defines POSIX’s internals), and XCU (which defines the shell command language, and the standard utilities available for the system). There’s also XRAT, which explains the rationale of the authors, but it’s less relevant for our purposes today. XBD and XRAT are both interesting as context for XSH and XCU, but those are the real meat of the specification. This article will focus on the XCU section, in particular the utilities part of that section. If you’re more interested in the XSH section, there’s an excellent summary page by <a href="https://sortix.org/" rel="nofollow">sortix’s</a> Jonas Termansen that you can read <a href="https://sortix.org/blog/posix-2024/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="highlights">Highlights <a href="#highlights" rel="nofollow">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="handling-of-filenames-in-shell">Handling of Filenames in Shell <a href="#handling-of-filenames-in-shell" rel="nofollow">#</a></h3>
<p>One of the most common errors in shell scripts when working with files tends to be the presumption that the newline character (<code>\n</code>) will not be present in the filename. Consider, for example, wanting to do some processing of files in a directory, processing the most recently modified ones first, with some custom break condition. The most common (naive) way of implementing this looks like this<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>1</span><span>ls -t <span>|</span> <span>while</span> <span>read</span> -r f<span>;</span> <span>do</span>
</span></span><span><span>2</span><span>	<span># if my condition; then break; fi</span>
</span></span><span><span>3</span><span>	<span># do something with $f</span>
</span></span><span><span>4</span><span><span>done</span>
</span></span></code></pre><p>After all, <code>read(1p)</code> reads logical lines from stdin into a variable, and <code>ls(1p)</code> outputs one entry per line. The problem is that pathnames<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="nofollow">2</a></sup> (as per section <code>3.254</code> of POSIX 2024) are just strings (meaning they can contain any bytes except the NUL character), meaning it’s incorrect to even treat it as a character string, let alone something you can put in a newline-separated form. As such, the correct solution, historically, has been to loop over the files in some other way (such as wildcards, which aren’t subject to expansion, or using <code>find(1p)</code>), then sort them, then run on the sorted datatype. This question is probably one of the most talked about in shell. POSIX 2024 addresses this issue in two ways.</p>
<h4 id="the-null-option">The Null Option <a href="#the-null-option" rel="nofollow">#</a></h4>
<p><code>find(1p)</code> now supports the <code>-print0</code> primary, which makes <code>find</code> use the NUL character as a separator. To go along with it, <code>xargs(1p)</code> now supports the <code>-0</code> argument, which reads arguments expecting them to be separated with NUL characters. Finally, for (most) other usecases, <code>read(1p)</code> now supports the <code>-d</code> (delimiter) argument, where <code>-d ''</code> means the NUL character is the delimiter. This is a non-ideal resolution though. Previous POSIX releases have considered <code>-print0</code> before, but never ended up adopting it because using a null terminator meant that any utility that would need to process that output would need to have a new option to parse that type of output.</p>
<p>More precisely, this approach does not resolve our original problem. <code>xargs(1p)</code> can’t sort, and therefore we still have to handle that logic separately, unless <code>sort(1p)</code> also grows this support, even after <code>read(1p)</code>. This problem continues with every other type of use-case. Importantly, it breaks the interoperability that POSIX was made to uphold.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is the second way that they’re fixing this issue.</p>
<h4 id="the-nuclear-option">The Nuclear Option <a href="#the-nuclear-option" rel="nofollow">#</a></h4>
<p>We’ve established that, yes, pathnames can include newlines. We have not established <em>why</em> they can do that. After some deliberation, the Austin Group could not find a single use-case for newlines in pathnames besides breaking naive scripts. Wouldn’t it be nice if the naive scripts were just correct now? Ok, that might be a bit much all at once. We’re heading there though!
A bunch of C functions<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="nofollow">3</a></sup> are now encouraged to report <code>EILSEQ</code> if the last component of a pathname to a file they are to create contains a newline (put differently, they’re to error out instead of creating a filename that contains a newline).</p>
<p>As for the utilities, the following utilities are now either encouraged to error out if they are to create a filename that contains a newline, and/or encouraged to error out if they are about to print a pathname that contains a newline in a context where newlines may be used as a separator: <code>admin(1p)</code>, <code>ar(1p)</code>, <code>awk(1p)</code>, <code>basename(1p)</code>, <code>cd(1p)</code>, <code>cksum(1p)</code>, <code>cmp(1p)</code>, <code>command(1p)</code>, <code>compress(1p)</code>, <code>cp(1p)</code>, <code>csplit(1p)</code>, <code>ctags(1p)</code>, <code>cxref(1p)</code>, <code>dd(1p)</code>, <code>df(1p)</code>, <code>diff(1p)</code>, <code>dirname(1p)</code>, <code>du(1p)</code>, <code>ed(1p)</code>, <code>ex(1p)</code>, <code>file(1p)</code>, <code>find(1p)</code>, <code>fuser(1p)</code>, <code>get(1p)</code>, <code>grep(1p)</code>, <code>hash(1p)</code>, <code>head(1p)</code>, <code>ipcs(1p)</code>, <code>link(1p)</code>, <code>ln(1p)</code>, <code>localedef(1p)</code>, <code>ls(1p)</code>, <code>m4(1p)</code>, <code>mailx(1p)</code>, <code>make(1p)</code>, <code>man(1p)</code>, <code>mkdir(1p)</code>, <code>mkfifo(1p)</code>, <code>mv(1p)</code>,<code>nm(1p)</code>, <code>patch(1p)</code>, <code>pax(1p)</code>, <code>prs(1p)</code>, <code>pws(1p)</code>, <code>rm(1p)</code>, <code>rmdel(1p)</code>, <code>sact(1p)</code>, <code>sccs(1p)</code>, <code>sh(1p)</code>, <code>sort(1p)</code>, <code>split(1p)</code>, <code>tee(1p)</code>, <code>touch(1p)</code>, <code>type(1p)</code>, <code>uncompress(1p)</code>, <code>unget(1p)</code>, <code>uniq(1p)</code>,<code>uucp(1p)</code>, <code>uudecode(1p)</code>, <code>val(1p)</code>, <code>vi(1p)</code>, <code>wc(1p)</code>, <code>what(1p)</code>, <code>yacc(1p)</code>, and <code>zcat(1p)</code>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <code>sh(1p)</code> talks about future direction, which may require the above to be treated as errors, and <code>pr(1p)</code> has a new section talking about “problematic pathnames” (since, for its use-case, tabs and vertical tabs are also problem-causing).</p>
<p>This is a much better solution, even in its current form. Unless your threat model includes attackers targeting you in particular (which, for example, immediately excludes all “home use” scripts), you can reasonably expect people to be discouraged from creating newline-containing characters, where before it might have been perceived as a “clever hack”. You can’t rely on your system enforcing those files not exist, but this is a major step in that direction.</p>
<h4 id="tldr">TL;DR <a href="#tldr" rel="nofollow">#</a></h4>
<p>While code like <code>ls -t | while read -r f</code> isn’t strictly correct yet, it’s likely to become strictly correct eventually. It’s also much more reasonable to opt into this early, unless you’re writing software with security requirements, are deleting files based on inputs, or similar.</p>
<h3 id="modern-c">Modern C <a href="#modern-c" rel="nofollow">#</a></h3>
<p>C has come a pretty long way in the last half-century, but for most intents and purposes, we haven’t been able to really benefit from it. Did you know that since <code>c11</code> we actually have built-in unicode support via <code>&lt;uchar.h&gt;</code> (ISO/IEC TR 19769:2004)? Most modern programs can’t actually utilize this, because they target <code>c89</code> (often incorrectly called “ANSI C”) or (if you’re lucky) <code>c99</code>. Why does this happen?</p>
<p>Well, when you’re building a new C program, you must decide what version of C to target. Target something too new, and no one will be able to build it. An example of this is <a href="https://github.com/aristocratos/btop" rel="nofollow">btop++</a>, which targetted some newer C++ features (notably <code>&lt;ranges&gt;</code>) that at the time of its publishing LLVM simply did not support: <code>libc++</code> simply didn’t have them yet (at least not in a stable format available on most distributions), and you couldn’t use gcc’s <code>libstdc++</code> because its <code>&lt;ranges&gt;</code> implementation depended on concepts (which LLVM also did not have yet).</p>
<p>As such, what you do, is you look at the platforms you want your program to run on, and try to figure out what the least common denominator would be. It just so happens that for the longest time, that denominator would be <code>c89</code>. For a little while now, it’s been <code>c99</code>. As for why that is, POSIX is a large part. You see, up until POSIX 2024, POSIX required that the <code>c89</code> compiler be present on the system. If you have <code>c89</code> you’re compliant, and if you do not, you are not. Most operating systems try to be POSIX compliant, and so it becomes a typical expectation (so you don’t have to worry about not having C at all, something other languages do have to worry about). This broad presumption of availability also pushes the embedded developers to provide something along those lines as well (setting the expectation of expectations), so most microcontrollers will have a <code>c89</code> (or again, recently, <code>c99</code>) toolchain available for them.</p>
<p>In short, application authors will tend not to target something until it’s fairly common, unless there’s a disproportionate advantage for their specific use-case (such as with <code>c99</code> over <code>c89</code>). What’s fairly common is strongly influenced by what is pseudo-guaranteed by the only portable standard we have.</p>
<p>Anyway, POSIX 2024 now requires <code>c17</code>, and does not require <code>c89</code>. Furthermore, the rationale mentions that future editions will not require <code>c17</code>, but will simply require whatever C specification version is the most modern and already implemented by major toolchains. So going forward, it’ll be much easier to justify using actually modern C for your new projects, and we can expect more and more embedded tools to provide modern C versions (something we’re already seeing, especially on microcontrollers that are based on ARM or RISC-V).</p>
<h3 id="limits--cooperation">Limits &amp; Cooperation <a href="#limits--cooperation" rel="nofollow">#</a></h3>
<p>Operating systems impose limits (often arbitrary) on what runs inside of them, and your applications (and scripts, and interactive usage) may also want to impose some limits and cooperation on what you run. As such, it’s important that you be able to interact with these limits. This is what the <code>nice(1p)</code>, <code>renice(1p)</code>, and <code>ulimit(1p)</code> utilities are meant to do.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>renice(1p)</code> only worked in absolutes, and <code>ulimit(1p)</code> only let you set a maximum write size for files (and didn’t differentiate between hard and soft limits), and was only available as part of the XSI extension.</p>
<p>With POSIX 2024, <code>ulimit(1p)</code> now supports reporting hard and soft limits and defines how those are used and interact. Additionally, the core image size, data segment size, open file descriptor amount, stack size, cpu time<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="nofollow">4</a></sup>, and address space limits now exist. This means that you can now (or rather, in the near future) reasonably rely on those existing and actually make use of them in portable scripts. <code>renice(1p)</code> is also updated to support the <code>-n</code> option (just like <code>nice(1p)</code>) to change the niceness value relatively.</p>
<p>Finally, we get a new utility: <code>timeout(1p)</code>. A lot of tools over the years have added options to handle their own timeouts (<code>curl(1)</code> in particular comes to mind, having several different types of timeouts for various use-cases), but with <code>timeout(1p)</code> you don’t need those (except for the added flexibility) anymore. It even handles child processes (in several implementation defined ways) and (importantly) lets you customize the signal and send a secondary <code>SIGKILL</code> after a secondary timeout.</p>
<h3 id="makefiles">Makefiles <a href="#makefiles" rel="nofollow">#</a></h3>
<p><code>make(1p)</code> remains the default build system to this day. Or at least sort of. Most people tend to write large scripts that wrap around make for various reasons, but in the end they will tend to produce a <code>Makefile</code> (though ninja has been gaining a lot of traction). Let’s take a look at a typical example to explain what the improvements are.</p>
<p>Our use-case is simple: we have a bunch of <code>.c</code> files in <code>./</code>. We want to compile and link them together. We also have a dependency (let’s say it’s libcurl) that requires some additional <code>CFLAGS</code> and <code>LDFLAGS</code>, which we query using <code>pkg-config</code> (well, I’m going to use <code>pkgconf</code>, it’s compatible). Importantly, we’re lazy in that we don’t want to specify every <code>.c</code> file in the directory in our Makefile. We also want to be able to clean our <code>.o</code> files without resorting to something like <code>git clean -fx</code> (that might clean some temporary artifacts that we do want to keep). With GNU Make, that might look something like so:</p>

</span></span></code></pre><p>That’s very few changes! Importantly, <code>gmake</code> can already handle this, meaning that by targeting this feature set you are strictly improving compatibility.</p>
<p>To be very specific, POSIX 2024 added support for the <code>$^</code> and <code>$+</code> internal macros, <code>::=</code>, <code>:::=</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>?=</code>, and <code>+=</code> macro assignment forms, silent includes via <code>-include</code>, <code>.NOTPARALLEL</code>, <code>.PHONY</code>, and <code>.WAIT</code> special targets (of which I did not cover the parallelism ones, as those will typically be mostly useful to meta build systems), and other less important changes that will be listed out in full below.</p>

<p>Our computers have more and more cores. In early 2017 (when the previous version of the standard was being finalized), most consumer grade hardware still maxed out at 4 cores (likely with SMT). This was also the segment of the market most likely to have background batch processing done in shell (as more enterprise-grade uses tend to write in a programming language that can integrate with their numerous external APIs). As such, while background processes were certainly common, it wasn’t as much of a common expectation that one might be doing some major processing (e.g. video re-encoding) in the background while performing other tasks. Of course, right after that point, in March 2017, the first generation of AMD Ryzen CPUs dropped on the scene and put processors with as many as 16 threads into the hands of consumers at more than reasonable prices. Today, in 2024, it’s difficult to buy a new workstation cpu with fewer than 12 threads, making the abovementioned scenarios all the more common.</p>
<p>The original specification of <code>logger(1p)</code> was written with a fairly uncommon, albeit necessary, use-case in mind. Today, such use-cases are much more common, and could be even more common if logging was easier to do correctly<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="nofollow">8</a></sup>. This original specification basically said that <code>logger(1p)</code> takes arguments like echo, but instead of outputting the text into stdout, it does so into syslog. It also means that logging the output of commands is unduly complicated.</p>
<p>In POSIX 2024, <code>logger(1p)</code> becomes a more fully-qualified command, with arguments and stdin interpretation. Notably, if there are no non-option arguments, <code>logger(1p)</code> will read the contents to log from stdin. It is also possible to ask the contents of a specific file to be logged using <code>-f</code>. Additionally, the syslog priority can be specified with <code>-p</code>, the <code>pid</code> of the logger process on each message using <code>-i</code>, and a syslog tag string using <code>-t</code>. Of additional importance, every non-empty line in the input or file shall be logged as a separate message, which means that the <code>-i</code> argument can be used to perform bulk logging where you can differentiate between failed runs.</p>
<h3 id="internationalization">Internationalization <a href="#internationalization" rel="nofollow">#</a></h3>
<p>Different people speak different languages, and it’s important to be able to translate your program for those. While you’re writing a C program or something along those lines, you can always reach for a library that you link into (such as GNU intl). While you’re writing a shell script, however, your options tend to be far more limited, since you can’t distribute it alongside the script very easily. Wouldn’t it be helpful if the standard everyone follows to various degrees actually settled on whatever interface was the most used in practice? Anyway, POSIX 2024 has adopted the <code>gettext</code> suite ala GNU, both as a system interface (<code>gettext(3p)</code> and co) and in the CLI (<code>gettext(1p)</code>, <code>ngettext(1p)</code>, <code>xgettext(1p)</code>, <code>msgmft(1p)</code>).</p>
<p>Since the target audience for this article is primarily shell people and advanced end-users, I’ll quickly go over the utilization in a shell context. <em>If you’re already familiar with the basics of GNU’s implementation, you can skip the rest of this section!</em> Translations are organized by message IDs (<code>msgid</code>) which can then be turned into arbitrary message strings (<code>msgstr</code>). These are encoded in a Portable Object file (<code>.po</code>), which you compile into a Machine Object file (<code>.mo</code>) using <code>msgfmt(1p)</code>. You then place them on your system in such a way that the <code>gettext(1p)</code> utilities will be able to find them, and the typical <code>LANG</code>/<code>LANGUAGE</code>/<code>LC_ALL</code>/<code>LC_MESSAGES</code> mechanism will get you the correct translations.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this minimal example, we’re going to write a very small program that talks about pets. The program will either print <code>you like cats</code>, <code>you like dogs</code>, or <code>you have %d pets</code> (where the <code>%d</code> will be used for <code>printf</code> output). We’ll also demonstrate how special-case plural forms work. We’ll be making a French and an English translation, and everything will be done relative to a directory of your choosing, that I will refer to as <code>$PWD</code> or <code>.</code> interchangeably. We’ll start by writing our two annotated <code>.po</code> files.</p>
<pre><code># ./en/pets.po : the filename and location is arbitrary
# empty messageid and str signals the header
# different languages deal with plural forms differently
# English only has a special case for "one"
# the `plural=` section is a C-like conditional expression
msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\n"
"Plural-Forms: nplurals=2; plural=n != 1;\n"
"Language: en\n"

# the IDs here are identical the messages
# since English is the source language for us
msgid "you like cats"
msgstr "you like cats"

msgid "you like dogs"
msgstr "you like dogs"

# note that if a translation isn't found
# the msgid is used as is
msgid "you have a pet"
msgid_plural "you have %d pets"
msgstr[0] "you have a pet"
msgstr[1] "you have %d pets"
</code></pre>
<pre><code># ./fr/pets.po
# we'll have a special case for 0 (aucun) and 1 (un)
# then the rest will be general case plural
msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\n"
"Plural-Forms: nplurals=3; plural=(n==0)?0: (n==1)?1: 2\n"

msgid "you like cats"
msgstr "vous aimez les chats"

msgid "you like dogs"
msgstr "vous aimez les chiens"

# I translated "pet" as "little companion"
# as there's no satisfactory direct translation
msgid "you have a pet"
msgid_plural "you have %d pets"
msgstr[0] "vous n'avez pas de petits compagnons"
msgstr[1] "vous avez un petit compagnon"
msgstr[2] "vous avez %d petits compagnons"
</code></pre>
<p>These files aren’t usable as-is. We need to compile them into <code>.mo</code> files. We’ll start by compiling them in the same directory: <code>msgfmt en/pets.po -o en/pets.mo; msgfmt fr/pets.po -o fr/pets.mo</code>. We now need to place them in a location that <code>gettext(1p)</code> and co. will be able to find it in. For those specific commands there are numerous special cases, and we’ll take advantage of those via <code>TEXTDOMAINDIR</code>. Under <code>$TEXTDOMAINDIR</code>, the system will try to look for your <code>$LC_MESSAGES</code> locale followed by <code>LC_MESSAGES</code>, then your textdomain. For convenience, we’ll make some symlinks: <code>ln -s . en/LC_MESSAGES; ln -s . fr/LC_MESSAGES</code>. We can now demonstrate the messages manually!</p>

</span></span><span><span>48</span><span><span># you have 2 pets</span>
</span></span></code></pre><p>In short, you can now rely on GNU-style <code>gettext</code> and <code>ngettext</code> utilities to be present, and write your script with the presumption that they are there. If the translation files are not installed, the message ID will be used (intelligently, in the case of plural forms), so you don’t need to worry about the possibility of them not being installed.</p>
<h3 id="minor-changes">Minor Changes <a href="#minor-changes" rel="nofollow">#</a></h3>
<p>These are changes that are relatively minor, but I still think deserve a spotlight.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>readlink(1p)</code> and <code>realpath(1p)</code> are now part of the standard, meaning you can reliably find where a symlink points to.</li>
<li><code>rm(1p)</code> takes a <code>-d</code> argument to remove empty directories too, enabling <code>rm -d *</code> and similar use-cases. You also get <code>-v</code>.</li>
<li><code>printf(1p)</code> now supports numbered conversion specs. For example, <code>printf '%2$s%1$s' a b</code> will print out <code>ba</code>.</li>
<li><code>sed(1p)</code> got several interesting upgrades, though for me the highlights are being able to use EREs like in <code>grep(1p)</code> using <code>-E</code>, as well as the <code>i</code> flag on the <code>s</code> command.</li>
<li><code>test(1p)</code> now has <code>-ef</code>, <code>-nt</code>, <code>-ot</code>. String comparisons (<code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code>) are now affected by collation.</li>
<li>There is a new category of utility, notably intrinsic utilities. These are like a special built-in that can be overridden by a user function, or as a regular built-in that cannot be substituted on the PATH nor need to be possible to exec (except for kill). It’s an important change, but it’s not very relevant for anyone that’s not writing a shell interpreter.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="changes-index">Changes Index <a href="#changes-index" rel="nofollow">#</a></h2>
<p>If you’re here early, hi! I’ve been working on this piece (I have a good chunk of an MB in plaintext notes) since the middle of the summer. Instead of letting it continue to drag on, I decided to radically reduce the scope just to the highlights, and only the XCU Utilities section. Thanks to sortix (linked above), I feel like I can stick with that latter, but I still plan to actually write out the full changes index here, as well as go over any of the Shell Command Language changes. It’s just going to take a long time still, since I’m not interested in simply dumping out the change notifications, but rather explain every change being made (albeit not as completely as I do in the highlights section). I will update this page in-place and post a second announcement when this section is complete. Don’t expect it any time soon though (probably not until early 2025).</p>
