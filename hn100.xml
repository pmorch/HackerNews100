<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-test="article-body-text">
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    <p>Google has plunged the internet into a “spiral of decline”, the co-founder of the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) lab has claimed.</p><p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/06/deepminds-founder-leaves-britains-brightest-ai-lab-really-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mustafa Suleyman</a>, the British entrepreneur who co-founded DeepMind, said: “The business model that Google had broke the internet.”</p><p>He said search results had become plagued with “clickbait” to keep people “addicted and absorbed on the page as long as possible”.</p><p>Information online is “buried at the bottom of a lot of verbiage and guff”, Mr Suleyman argued, so websites can “sell more adverts”, fuelled by Google’s technology.</p><p>Mr Suleyman was one of three people who set up pioneering AI lab DeepMind in London 2010. The company was bought by Google for £400m and it has become the cornerstone of the search giant’s AI operations.</p><p>Mr Suleyman, 39, quit Google 18 months ago and has since set up a rival venture, Inflection AI. The company is developing a conversational chatbot, similar to ChatGPT, amid a race by AI companies to usurp Google’s dominance of the web.</p><p>The entrepreneur has developed a chatbot called Pi, which he says can act as a kind of AI confidante or coach. He has raised more than $1.5bn for the new technology.</p><p>The criticism of his former employer came as Mr Suleyman told the Telegraph about plans for a new international body to monitor AI threats.</p><p>Mr Suleyman, along with billionaire former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, plan to present proposals for an International Panel on AI Safety at Prime Minister <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/09/23/artificial-intelligence-safety-summit-sunak-ai-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rishi Sunak’s global summit</a> on the technology next month.&nbsp;</p><p>The DeepMind co-founder said the panel could be “modelled on the IPCC” – the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – to “establish the scientific consensus around the current capabilities” of AI.</p><p>Mr Suleyman said the IPCC, which was first set up in 1988, was a “good inspiration” for establishing a “rigorous body” for making predictions about AI risks. Other backers of the plan include Reid Hoffman, the billionaire LinkedIn founder, and Florentino Cuéllar, president of the Carnegie think tank.</p><p>The AI panel would provide governments with regular assessments on the level of danger posed by the technology.</p><p>The UK’s AI Safety Summit is due to take place at Bletchley Park and is expected to gather world leaders and tech entrepreneurs to address the challenges of “frontier AI” that might cause “significant harm, including the loss of life”.</p><p>The two-day summit on Nov 1 and 2 is expected to be attended by top lobbyists from the likes of Meta and Google. Kamala Harris, the US vice president, is expected to attend, while a Chinese delegation has been invited.&nbsp;</p><p>The leaders will try to find common ground on tackling AI risks. Officials are also understood to be considering setting up an international institute for AI safety.</p>

    <p>Michelle Donelan, the technology secretary, told the Telegraph the&nbsp;conference would “consider the biggest risks and biggest opportunities that come from frontier AI”, bringing together “companies, countries and also experts”.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/05/23/chatgpt-sam-altman-ai-regulation-risk-fears/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Concern about the technology</a> has been sparked by the overnight success of ChatGPT, which was seen as a wake-up call for world leaders about the speed at which the technology was being developed.&nbsp;</p><p>A new wave of chatbots, built on so-called “large language models”, can answer questions and have online conversations in an almost uncannily human way. They can write emails, essays, poetry or music, prompting concerns they could create upheaval in the jobs market.</p><p>Writing in his recent book, The Coming Wave, Mr Suleyman called for a “containment” of high-risk AI advances, so governments can get ahead of developments that may threaten jobs, elections and human life.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Suleyman said chatbots could “take on Google” by providing more accurate information than internet search.</p><p>However, despite recent advances, many chatbots suffer from errors and in some cases may make up false information, creating a hurdle to taking on search engines.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/02/13/google-microsofts-ai-bots-will-pollute-internet-digital-effluence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google is also developing</a> a rival AI chatbot project, called Bard.&nbsp;</p><p>Google was approached for comment.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile on Saturday, the Government confirmed 100 winners of £5m in grant funding for AI start-ups, including a business tackling clothing waste and a company finding a use for the technology in vineyards.&nbsp;</p><p>Ms Donelan also announced a further £32m in grant funding for high-growth businesses using AI, to be confirmed after the UK summit.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">

                                                                                                
                
<p><span><span>I</span> have a dirty secret. When some of our friends at church nod in approval upon hearing that we haven’t got a proper television, I am happy to let them think that this is largely because we want to protect our children from all the woke nonsense in cartoons. We go to one of those scary parishes where the old Latin Mass is said twice on Sundays, and I must say the sexual proclivities of </span><i><span>Dora the Explorer </span></i><span>are a major topic of concern.</span></p>
<p><span>Our friends have a point. There is a lot of this stuff going around, and you have to wonder whether even the most progressive parents really believe their kids need to learn whether in addition to being blue and wearing a diaper, Gonzo in </span><i><span>Muppet Babies</span></i><span> is gender-queer. (Do Muppets in fact have sex? Inquiring minds don’t in fact want to know.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But in our case the objections are aesthetic as much as anything else. I have always admired the artistry of traditional hand-drawn animation, and the CGI you see on TV (usually farmed out to digital sweatshops in Asia) is even uglier than the top-shelf Disney/Pixar version. The color palette is unimaginably garish, a lot of neon fuschias, turquoises, and oranges, plus a distinct shade of cyan that looks like radioactive Mountain Dew. (Thank goodness the backgrounds are always empty.)</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>In a typical episode the Paw Patrol send an entire fleet of vehicles to an attempted misdemeanor</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Then there is the sheer inanity of the dialogue, characters, and situations. When I was a child, Doug Funny was subjected to various ethical dilemmas, and even the Ninja Turtles of blessed memory had quarrels and existential crises — I recall Michaelangelo once seeking hypnotherapy for his pizza addiction — in between fighting some genuinely frightening baddies. These days we have </span><i><span>Super Truck</span></i><span>. Have you heard of </span><i><span>Super Truck</span></i><span>? It’s a quite popular show about a truck. Our three-year-old, quite perceptively, calls it “Stupid Truck.”</span></p>
<p><span>Despite my best efforts, the kids have managed to see a lot of these shows, mostly at grandparents’ houses. The worst one, worse than </span><i><span>Daniel Tiger</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>PJ Masks</span></i><span> or even </span><i><span>My Little Pony</span></i><span> (which is the subject of a pedophile cult in these United States) is </span><i><span>Paw Patrol</span></i><span>. This program centers around a group of talking dogs who work for various emergency services: Chase is the cop, Marshall the fireman (or rather firepup), Skye the helicopter pilot, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, emergency services seem to be the only thing going on in this horrifying world. Every episode revolves around some poor citizen finding himself on the wrong side of the law or the victim of an alleged natural disaster or public health crisis. In a typical episode, the Paw Patrol send an entire fleet of vehicles — cars, trucks, boats, aeroplanes, submarines, and even, insanely, a recycling van — to respond to an attempted misdemeanor or a minor traffic accident.</span></p>
<p><span>All of this activity is carried out under the aegis of one Mayor Goodway. She is very much a ruler in the Nero fiddling or Elagabalus line, a deranged eccentric who collects chickens (curiously enough, they cannot speak in this universe otherwise full of anthropomorphic animals) and seems totally uninterested in the actual well-being of her subjects, much less the material and other costs of maintaining a rather large police force. (I say “subjects” rather than “citizens” because as far as I can tell, there is no evidence of elections ever being carried out.)</span></p>
<p><i><span>Paw Patrol </span></i><span>is Giorgio Agamben’s nightmare, a country in which a permanent state of emergency exists, under which governments have limitless power to rule unilaterally. There is no society or even commerce in </span><i><span>Paw Patrol</span></i><span>, only the relentless unthinking force of the police state, ostensibly responding to a never-ending crisis. It is the most influential work of fascist art since Ezra Pound.</span></p>
<p><span>Worse still than the omnidirectional sense of faux-crisis is the depiction of the offenders on the receiving end of the Paw Patrol’s mob justice. The Ruff-Ruff Pack, collar-less and dirty, are clearly working class dogs; no attempt is ever made to reform or otherwise induce them to behave better. It’s as if they exist to be brutalised. (One thinks of those lines of Auden: “Somebody chose their pain, / What needn’t have happened did.”)</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>I like to imagine that somewhere in Adventure Bay there is some sort of resistance movement</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>But perhaps the oddest thing of all is the fact that apart from the pups, the dictator Goodway, and the handful of people whom they routinely assault, the island seems somewhat sparsely populated. I like to imagine that somewhere in Adventure Bay there is some sort of resistance movement, a faction of poets and religious types opposed to the mayor’s tyrannical regime. Which is when it occurs to me: </span><i><span>they’re all freaking dead, aren’t they? Or maybe we are talking about a gulag situation. Where else is all the production happening? There are no visible factories, but someone has to build all the machines and tools and perform the necessary agricultural work to keep the mayor’s chickens fed.</span></i></p>
<p><span>All of this no doubt is taking a bunch of magenta pixels too seriously. Maybe. I can’t help but think that in addition to their deleterious effect on children’s imaginations, shows like </span><i><span>Paw Patrol</span></i><span> are a serious political threat. I hate to go all Frankfurt School in a light column like this one, but it is always worrying when citizens of a democratic society are taught to worship the police, to accept so-called “states of exception” without question, and to delight in the machinery of punishment. This is the reason that, growing up in the 1990s, I always hated</span><i><span> Cops</span></i><span>, my love of moustaches and aviator sunglasses notwithstanding. Somehow I always wanted the guy in the wife beater shirt (invariably removed during the course of the episode for reasons that were always mysterious) with the 40 ounce bottle of malt liquor and the cigarette to get away. Like the supposed villains in </span><i><span>Paw Patrol</span></i><span>, he never did.</span></p>

In this case, I was spending a lot of time trying to learn SQL; you will be pleased to note I am now able to pad my resume with “Intermediate Database Language Skills” with the best of them.</strong></p><p>A few years back, my wife was at a baby shower hosted by a friend by a mutual acquaintance. In a conversation with the hostess, my wife learned they were in a tough financial position - they were always broke, and no amount of budgeting seemed to help them get ahead; they had cut every cost they could and things were just getting worse and worse. She admitted to my wife that she just felt like she was sinking further and further underwater, and didn’t see any way out for her or her family.</p><p>Note: The hostess and her husband were both doctors. They had a combined income somewhere upwards of $200,000 a year, and as the conversation developed my wife learned that their problems started and stopped with the hostess not being able to save quite as much as she’d like once the payments on their very nice house and current-year cars were made. At the time she leaned on my wife for emotional support over finances, our family of four’s income was less than $30,000 a year.</p><p>You should know the hostess wasn’t mean-spirited in the least, and we liked her then and continue to do so. But she did have a kind of tunnel vision I’ve since noticed is increasingly common: If you came from a family that did pretty well financially, went to college and then immediately started to do pretty well yourself, it’s hard to get any kind of context for what life is like at lower income levels. This isn’t a matter of the relatively-wealthy being dumb or insensitive; it’s just legitimately difficult to get a handle on what it’s like in a life you’ve never lived, and often being legitimately confused as to why anyone would opt to make less money instead of improving their lot with training and education.</p><p>In that spirit, I’d like to offer my services as a sort of has-been-poor guide, to fill you in on what it’s like on the other side of the tracks. In this role, I’m qualified in two ways. The first is common - we’ve never done exceptionally well financially. Things have been better in recent years as I’ve finally clawed towards the upper-end of lower-class, but Covid has reminded us how short-lived that kind of qualified success can be. We’ve had to economize in dozens of interesting ways, make hard choices here and there and sometimes/often do entirely without. It hasn’t been easy.</p><p><span>At the same time, I’m mostly </span><em>happy.</em><span> I have a wonderful wife who is very satisfying to be near, two kids who are about as custom-fit to my personality as possible, and dozens of friends online and off who would take a bullet for me, and vice versa. This is important because I want you to know I’m not trying to make you feel bad - I know and understand that everyone has a different set of problems, and that I’m not unique in living in an imperfect world. I’m not trying to exaggerate problems for political points or to try to get legislation passed. Take no guilt from this article - It’s informational, not a call to arms.</span></p><p>One of the bigger disconnects I run into in talking to people at or above living wage levels of income is that it’s usually assumed that the quality of things has a pretty linear association to the price. This is true at most price points, from “doing OK” all the way up to “Jeff Bezos” - if you pay a little more, you get a little more. If you pay a little less, you get a little less.</p><p><span>Because this relationship is what you’d expect, you get a lot of reasonable-sounding advice that, while not exactly wrong, fails to capture the nuance of poor-people-price-mechanics very well. According to this randomly selected article, </span><a href="https://smartasset.com/mortgage/how-much-should-i-spend-on-rent#:~:text=While%20everyone's%20circumstances%20are%20unique,30%25%20of%20your%20household%20income." rel="">I should really make sure not to spend more than 30% of my income on rent</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>While everyone’s circumstances are unique, many experts&nbsp;say it’s best to spend no more than 30% of your monthly gross income on housing-related expenses, including rent and utilities. Under that rule, it’s best to make sure that the amount you spend on rent is well below 30% of your household income. In other words, if you’re making $3,000 a month, it’s a good idea to pay no&nbsp;more than $900 for rent and other housing costs.  </p></blockquote><p>The general thinking here is that if I spend more than 30%, I’m making myself vulnerable in all other aspects of my budget; why burden yourself with more than you can handle, when I could take a slightly worse place and be that much closer to financial health? From the perspective of the 50k a year and up crowd, this makes sense - $1250, after all, will rent a reasonable house or apartment in a lot of markets.

And while the first apartment I showed you was in a relatively nice, livable part of town this one is in a more gun-fire prone area ominously referred to by locals as “the triangle”. Phoenix’s mostly gravel-and-concrete landscaping style cleans up nice (note the still-wet recently hosed concrete), but make no mistake: this isn’t the kind of apartment complex where hypodermic needles are exclusively owned by diabetics.</p><p>That’s the drop-off you experience at the lower price levels - there’s nothing between “This is a tiny but acceptable apartment” and “Slum apartments in stab-ville”. </p><p>None of this is to discount the budget advice above completely - this is absolutely the kind of apartment I should be living in right now, if I was making perfect budgetary decisions. But consider that this is a choice I have to make - do I spend 50% more on an apartment and stress my budget to death, or make my wife and kids in a place where I have 5 front doors within 15 feet of ours in the murder-iest part of town? Neither choice is great, but the lack of intermediate choices forces you to do one or the other. </p><p>Whichever you choose, a person of less-than-intermediate income has to be prepared to stick with the rental long-term, should things not go well. This is because apartments at both of these levels quite accurately assume that you can’t afford a lawyer - while it’s normal to put down a month or two worth of rent as a security deposit, it’s much less normal to get it back; the apartment complex has no reason to give back thousands of dollars they can simply keep. This means every time you move, you pay something like a third to a month’s wages for the privilege. Since breaking a lease often means you lose your privilege to live anywhere non-hellish, this means if you don’t have cash reserves (more on these later*) at the exact right time of year, you might end up in the same place for another full year whether you like it or not.</p><p><strong>Note: It’s been pointed out to me that I completely forgot to talk about cash reserves and how they effect this kind of thing. It’s also been pointed out that these numbers only “make sense” in particular markets - i.e. it’s cheaper or more expensive to live other places, so the exact figures here don’t translate well for everyone. I’ll write a follow up post incorporating some of this kind of feedback soon to make up for it.</strong></p><p><span>I am always consistently shocked by how little people living at a decent-to-great income level fear their cars; it seems like they hardly lie awake at night thinking about their iffy alternator much, if at all. Scott Alexander does a pretty good job of explaining the obverse experience </span><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/16/basic-income-not-basic-jobs-against-hijacking-utopia/" rel="">here</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>When I first started working with poor patients, I was shocked how many of the problems in their lives were car-related. For well-off people like me, having a car is background noise; you buy or lease it for a reasonable price, then never worry about it again. Poor people can’t afford to buy and don’t always have good enough credit to lease. They tend to get older, sketchier cars that constantly break down. A constant complaint I heard: “My car broke, I can’t afford repairs, and I’m going to get fired if I can’t make it to my job”. Some of them can’t afford insurance and take their chances without it. Others have had various incidents with the police that cost them their license, but they can’t just not show up to work, so they drive anyway and hope they don’t get arrested.  </p></blockquote><p>This is actually pretty close to the experience. It’s telling that Scott thinks the problem with a lease comes only from credit issues - a pretty bottom-barrel ford leases for 300-400 a month. For a person who makes 30,000-40000k a year, that’s something like 10-15% of their income, before we talk about insurance; couple that with the fact that you can’t squeak by on liability-only insurance in most leases, and we are already into a prohibitively expensive range.</p><p>But there’s other things - liability insurance, as mentioned above, is often your only option that makes sense - if your car costs $2000, paying an extra $50-100 per month for high-deductible doesn’t add up; you are still $1000 out of pocket to cover the deductible in the event you need to use it. But since you can’t afford it in the first place, you don’t think about that; you just start driving insanely carefully at all times and pray any accidents you get in aren’t your fault. One slip-up and you either can’t get to work at all, or you spend a lot more time doing it. Remember: Uber isn’t an option here; the ~$400 a month it would cost would bankrupt you.</p><p>You are also more or less forced to learn to do mechanic work. I’m an administrator by trade - I usually work in the kind of jobs that have “assistant” appended to them. One of my greatest prides is typing speed, and when people ask me my hobby I tell them “Excel”. If you were judging me by my interests and natural skillset, you wouldn’t expect me to be able to change my own tires. But over the years necessity has forced me to get pretty decent at car work - I’ve done clutch rebuilds and head gasket jobs and a bunch of other miserable (for me) work that I would have rather avoided. But this was often the only option I had - it was either figuring out how to replace an alternator or do a full brake job over the weekend or lose my ability to get to the grocery store in under an hour. Keep in mind the money saved here is just the labor - parts still have a cost that’s unavoidable. </p><p>The practical upshot of this is whenever I drive, it’s very slowly, very carefully, and listening in terror to any small noise the car makes. It’s a constant stress, and it’s limiting; we don’t go on long road trips often, and when we do my joke with my wife is usually something like “Well, if the car breaks down somewhere else, we’ll just start living there”.</p><p>It’s reasonable to ask “If cars are so terrible, why not use public transport?”. I live in a city, and this is in fact an option that would solve many of my problems: I wouldn’t have to worry about repairs, my gasoline and insurance bills would disappear and anything that happened to the bus is the city’s problem, not mine. Especially in an emergency public transit would be a godsend and might be the difference between keeping and losing my job.</p><p>But there’s other things to consider on this, as well. My commute isn’t short, and isn’t bus-friendly; it would go from about 30 minutes each way to just under 4 hours roundtrip. And when your commute starts and ends in a bad area, which is typical of a low-income family in a low-paying job, this means those four hours a day are spent surrounded by people who range from normal commuters at best to visibly mentally imbalanced and trying to speak to you the whole ride. I understand from talking to friends in “our mass transit is great!” towns that this isn’t the case everywhere but this is something that on average gets worse the poorer you get. I could make the commute shorter by taking a worse job (Maybe - the job market isn’t great right now), but that comes with career-limiting downsides of it’s own.</p><p>When I’m trying to explain to my sons how a company decides what to pay someone, it usually goes something like this: A company is looking to pay a person as little as they can and keep them, so a person’s pay is determined by how rare their skills are and how much demand there is for those skills. The value of their work doesn’t factor in as much - An administrative assistant might touch every department in the company every day and facilitate a massive amount of work, but they still don’t get paid much - it’s hard to justify when you could hire and train up someone to do the same thing nearly as well with very little difficulty.</p><p>I think this is a fairly accurate way to look at pay, but it applies to other aspects of the job. If you got sick more often than usual this year and used up your legally mandated sick days, would your company fire you for getting sick again, or demand you work sick? If the company decides it needs to cut wages, is your position the cheap-to-hire-for job the company didn’t spend a lot of money and time filling? If you don’t have rare skills, management is aware that they can ask for you to work extra hours, avoid letting you use paid time off and change your list of job duties on a whim - both they and you know that if you won’t do it, they can find somebody who will tomorrow. Not every company is bad in these ways - good people do exist - but every company is aware they could, and that tends to color every aspect of the job whether they intend it to or not. </p><p>The worst treatment you tend to get is, perhaps counterintuitively, in jobs that approach living wage despite your low value and replaceability as a worker. These jobs tend towards needing someone who can put in a lot of hours for customer interactions that require a single point of contact; they reward intense focus over long periods of time in unpleasant situations. Another way to say this is that these are high-stress jobs with a lot of mandatory overtime and very fast pacing - they pay a lot because they can’t get people to do them otherwise. Turnover in these jobs is absurd despite the pay - some people can keep up with them but it isn’t typical. In my first (and hopefully last) claims adjuster job, two people had heart attacks in my office in a six month period.</p><p>The obvious solution for the worker here would seem to be to train themselves in such a way as to be more valuable, but this is often a bit harder or less plausible than it sounds. Some of this can be personal reasons (if you are barely holding things together, it’s hard to find the time and energy to get a bachelors degree from scratch) or financial (It’s nice to think you could learn a new skill and start a new career, but if you are barely keeping your family fed as it is, you might not actually be able to take the pay cut dropping back to entry level would require. </p><p>To give you an example of how this looks, 2020 started with me in my second month at a sustainable job with a salary around 50k, the most I had ever made. When the job was disrupted by Covid, I was the first to go - I had little tenure and no rare specialty absolutely required by the company, so my responsibilities could at least theoretically be divided among the retained employees. I then took one of those high-stress high-intensity jobs in the mortgage industry, made kind of a lot of money (for me, on pace to do about 60k in a year) but eventually had a minor nervous breakdown; the company informed me I couldn’t use my paid time off without a month’s notice to handle it, and that they’d simply let my workload pile up while I was gone, leaving me in a worse place. I managed to switch to another company, but found out once I started that the job duties, pay, and hours were all misrepresented in the interview process - I’m free to leave if I don’t like it, since the job will be easy to fill. </p><p>In the meantime, I’ve added a few skills to my resume associated with better jobs and lifestyles, and I’m hopeful things get better. But “just the skill without an associated degree” means this is a slog - I’ve applied for about 100 jobs in the past month, but haven’t had a single response; there’s simply better qualified candidates at the kind of pay I can support my family with, and the kind of extremely junior positions I might have a better shot at would leave us unable to pay bills within a few months. </p><p>This isn’t evil on anyone’s part, and you shouldn’t feel bad about it - I’ve made a lot of choices in my life that led to this point and I have a lot of responsibility in terms of where I find myself. But understand that even if you are willing to sacrifice the labor and time it takes to work towards an uncertain goal, there’s still a fair amount of luck involved. And some people are at my level or below it because they simply lack the capability to do better - not everyone can or should learn to code, or would be able to successfully go back to school. </p><p>The summary here is that low-paying jobs are often uniquely bad for reasons beyond the pay itself. The people who work them aren’t unwilling to change this, but often they are unable to, either because the means to change their circumstance is outside of their control or because their attempts to do so fail. Some are lazy and unmotivated, but not all.</p><p><span>When someone is telling me they are or have been poor and I’m trying to determine </span><em>how poor exactly</em><span> they were, there’s one evergreen question I ask that has never failed to give me a good idea of what kind of situation I’m dealing with. That question is: “How many times have they turned off your water?”.</span></p><p>The reason this question works is because it lets me know whether the person I’m talking to has “felt” broke - I.E. been in a situation where they felt resource strapped for some reason or another - or has “been broke”, actually factually unable to pay for basic services they needed to survive at a minimally decent human level. </p><p>A person who feels broke might not have a lot of money, or might not have any liquid dollars in their wallet at all. But just being out of money doesn’t make you broke in the sense that they turn off your water - that takes time. Usually you can be over a month late before the water company actually goes to the trouble of sending someone out to turn off your water. Even if someone feels broke and can’t immediately pay their bills (this is rare for people who feel broke, by the way; they usually have a few hundred dollars they can get at somewhere, some space on a credit card, etc.) this only means they need to cut their spending somewhat the next month and catch up; they might not be King Midas after watching their budget for 30 days, but they won’t turn the tap some morning and finds nothing comes out.</p><p>Obviously being broke is the opposite; you are legitimately out of funds you need to cover a bill. It’s not a matter of watching your budget closer, either - you’ve cut the fat from every possible place and you still just don’t have enough to make everything work. Sometimes this is because you lost a job and your income dried up (more common these Covid days) and sometimes it’s because a surprise bill caused your budget to get behind in a way you couldn’t recover from. But as opposed to someone who simply overspent, being broke implies you have some structural problem with your income and finances that you can’t fix - all it took was a small bump of some kind to upset your apple cart, and now you’ve moved from “hanging on” to “asking your neighbor to use their hose to fill up a bucket so you can flush your toilet”.</p><p>It also implies there’s no place left to cut - you don’t have a car payment, and your insurance is minimal if it hasn’t lapsed already. You don’t have cable. You are eating a lot of rice. There’s simply nothing “extra” left to cut, and now you are choosing between things like power and internet (which you need to work and find work, these days) and water (which you need to survive).  Often you’ve already even prioritized those things, because as I’ve said they don’t turn off your water for a while; you’ve been juggling things like power and water, now with late fees, for a while. And one day your wife calls you and tells you the water is off, and there’s nothing you can do; maybe some family member can help you out, or maybe you live without utilities for a week or so until you get paid and start the next pay cycle that much more behind. </p><p>The best case scenario is you get helped, and you try to accept that graciously and thankfully, but consider the shame of this - you can’t support your family, and you’ve been forced to go to someone who can, implicitly admit you can’t fulfil your basic purpose as a human, and ask them to take away from their family to do what you can’t. And often they do - family and friends are a wonderful thing. I’m thankful more than I can say for mine; I’m blessed by them. But it’s exhausting; you understand going through it why so many people give up on trying to make things better, because you’ve already reached this point where you and everyone around you understands that you just can’t function to minimum levels as a father and husband; it’s hard to wake up the next day and go “well, I’m sure that’s all in the past - let’s learn Java!”.</p><p>If you are broke enough, you get what in some ways is very good health insurance: zero deductible, all prescriptions paid for, and no coverage limits. The reason you get this is because everyone else in the country pays for it for you - it’s government insurance, given to those at income levels so low it’s clear they have no chance at all of covering their own bills. It’s not without downsides (the doctors suck, for the most part, and referrals for anything beyond basic family care are time-consuming to get) but you  know that if your children or wife got seriously hurt or sick, there would be some level of care available that wouldn’t instantly bankrupt you.</p><p>There’s a point at which you are making too much money to get government insurance, though. As of today this number is &nbsp;$36,156, or ~138% of the federal poverty limit. This creates an interesting situation - if you were making 35k at a job and offered a job at 40k with healthcare benefits, taking the job would actually leave you in a worse place than before in most cases; insurance is expensive, and the government offers exactly zero help if you A. make more than a certain amount of money and B. work for a place with benefits. So where you had insurance and made 35k before, now you have insurance and make 32k; your step forward put you further in the hole.</p><p>This is what’s usually referred to as a perverse incentive - it’s a situation that “pays” you for doing the wrong thing. In this case, the wrong thing is rejecting jobs that pay more and offer more advancement out of fear that someone will get sick and you either won’t be able to get them care or will bankrupt yourself doing so. If you are smart, you probably take this risk - after all, you might eventually make 70k and be in a place where insurance is merely expensive rather than a complete budget disaster. But it’s a real risk you have to take as you climb towards financial security, and not everyone chooses to take it.</p><p>Dental insurance is worse. There’s an internet meme that says that teeth are “luxury bones” that insurance doesn’t cover, and this is more or less true - even with dental insurance, you are still out of pocket significant amounts of money for even basic dental care. I haven’t been to a dentist since I was 11 years old for reasons related to this. I often consider the fact that I’m in a bit of a race against time with my own teeth - at some point they will go from “merely crooked” to “visibly rotting”, and very few people will hire a person with visibly rotten teeth for work. </p><p>Note for other people of limited income: Take the time to check and see if there’s a dental school in your town. The care dental school clinics give isn’t free, but it’s significantly cheaper and in my experience pretty good. One of my children has significant dental care needs, and he regularly goes to the dentist at a clinic of this sort - they treat him well and do good work. I can’t compare it to a “real dentist”, but it’s infinitely better than nothing.</p><p>I mentioned this before, but I can work on cars, and I’m able to do anything less complex than a full engine or transmission rebuild. This is an example of what I refer to with friends as “poor people skills”, or capabilities you develop beyond the norm because it’s necessary to survive.</p><p>The most fun poor person skill by far is buying things off of Craigslist. It’s by no means rocket science, but having little money means you end up buying all but the very cheapest of durable goods used, and repeated practice at this makes you skilled at finding deals other people might miss.</p><p>It’s been decades since I bought new furniture besides IKEA; most of that comes from Craigslist. Cars come from Craigslist - you can buy used cars at dealerships and it’s less risky, but comes with a 25-50% markup for the safety that a lot of people can’t afford. Durable cookware, like pots and pans? Craigslist, if you want anything kind of nice; the stuff you can afford at target starts flaking teflon into your eggs a week in.</p><p>Rich person tip: Unless you really, really need everything in your house to clearly be part of a unified set, you are a sucker if you buy furniture new; this is especially true for non-upholstered wooden furniture. Antique furniture is prettier, studier, has more street cred and can be had for a song compared to retail store prices; let other people pay those and look average while you put in a minimum effort, save money, and get cooler older furniture that makes you look like a person of taste rather than an every day jive-turkey retail sucker.</p><p>Poor people tip: Stop buying spatulas on Craigslist. Just work some more overtime. Yes, I know it’s a lot of overtime already but spatulas cost $5 new - a $2 spatula is not a deal and the savings don’t pay for even minimum-wage time spent driving to talk to a guy named “Pastor Dave” about used discount cookware in a Circle K parking lot.</p><p>That last tip to poor people seems like a joke, but at some point it’s something you have to look out for - you get so used to thinking of money as an extremely finite resource that any amount of absolute savings in purchase price looks necessary to you. But once you conquer that, it’s like a superpower; you can save hundreds or thousands of dollars furnishing a room; you can buy a box of books with the one book you want in it for less than the price of that individual book from a bookstore. </p><p>The only downside to your new found x-man discount used goods status is the possibility of getting stabbed; it’s a good idea to look at the approximate area of the guy selling you a hamster cage before you find yourself in the more murder-prone parts of town at night, conspicuously button-down and muggable hoping nobody notices you. Get that one little bit down, though, and it’s like the skies open up and the heavens beam savings down; all the discount archery sets and knock-off kitchen knives of the world are suddenly at your fingertips.</p><p>That’s it! We made it through. As I said before, none of this was meant to make you feel guilty and I hope and pray I managed not to sound like I was whining - I really want to emphasize that outside of everything I’ve talked about here, I’m absurdly wealthy in terms of the people who choose to spend their lives in my vicinity. I’m mostly a happy guy, and anymore one who can often pay his bills on time. I can really honestly confirm that money isn’t the operative thing that makes you happy; it really is  more about having good people around to talk to, take care of and to be taken care of by.</p><p>And if you do better than I do - say, if you are a person who completed college on time and went on to your deserved place in the upper-middle class -  I hereby command you not to feel bad about it. It’s OK to do well, and I have an idea of the kind of work you’ve put in to get to where you are; there’s a great chance you deserve to have the things you have. I hope this was instructive for you, and I wish you continued success.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks" id="incArticle"><p>Matt Damon announces to the crowd, “We have an early Christmas present for you.” Kenneth Branagh takes over, holding court with an adoring audience. Playing General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project, and nuclear physicist Niels Bohr respectively, the two A-listers herald the arrival of the Danish scientist at Los Alamos. This is the secret facility established in New Mexico in 1943 to build the first <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/why-vertical-smoke-trails-are-seen-during-nuclear-explosions">atom bomb</a> and recreated 80 years later by Christopher Nolan to film his epic hit movie, <em>Oppenheimer</em>.</p><p>“The British pilots put me in the bomb bay,” Branagh as Bohr laughingly recounts in his best Danish accent, they “showed me the oxygen — of course, I messed it up. When they opened me up in Scotland I was unconscious. I pretended I’d been napping.”</p><div data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/embed"><p itemprop="associatedMedia"><iframe frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bK6ldnjE3Y0?feature=oembed&amp;rel=0&amp;enablejsapi=1" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><p>The scene barely hints at the knife-edge circumstances of the Dane’s dramatic escape from Nazi-occupied Europe, nor the remarkable story behind his flight to safety. While researching my new book, <em>Mosquito</em>, about the U.K. Royal Air Force <a target="_blank" href="https://www.peoplesmosquito.org.uk/2013/12/06/operation-carthage-the-shell-house-raid-21st-march-1945/">raid on the Gestapo headquarters</a> in Copenhagen, I discovered the fascinating truth about both.</p><p>At the time he joined the Manhattan Project, Niels Bohr was perhaps the most famous scientist in the world after Albert Einstein. His Danish homeland had been under German occupation since April 1940.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">Kenneth Branagh as nuclear physicist Niels Bohr, and the man himself, known to the British Special Operations Executive as the ‘Great Dane.’ <em>via the author</em> </span></figure><p>On the day of the invasion, the professor was in the lab in Copenhagen that he had set up, attempting to dissolve a pair of Nobel medals in a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acid. Bohr was trying to stop the Nazis from getting their hands on two 23-karat-gold Nobels he’d been given for safekeeping by two Jewish German physicists fleeing the antisemitism of Hitler’s Germany. He’d auctioned off his <em>own</em> Nobel medal in 1940 to raise money for victims of Finland’s ‘Winter War’ with the Soviet Union. That he’d allowed the institute in Copenhagen that carried his name to provide sanctuary for those German exiles also spoke to his altruism. But it was also personal. By virtue of his Jewish mother, Niels Bohr was Jewish by heritage, if not through religious belief.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">German troops patrol the streets of Copenhagen, during the Nazi occupation of Denmark. <em>Getty Images</em> </span></figure><p>Britain’s Special Operations Executive (SOE), set up in 1940 with instructions from Winston Churchill to “set Europe ablaze” through sedition and sabotage, had first tried to prompt Bohr’s departure from Denmark in 1943 by sending a secret agent to the scientist’s home. Bohr’s polite rejection of London’s invitation was hidden beneath the stamps stuck to three separate postcards. Next time, SOE sent a written message, along with detailed instructions:</p><p><em>“A small hole to a depth of 4mm has been bored in the two keys. The holes were plugged up and concealed after the message was inserted. Professor Bohr should gently file the keys at the point indicated until the hole appears. The message can then be syringed or floated out onto a micro-slide.”</em></p><p>The message inside from Bohr’s friend Professor James Chadwick of Liverpool University was the size of a grain of sand and contained in a hole the width of a pinhead and had to be deciphered using a 600-power lens microscope. Chadwick urged him to leave Denmark for the United Kingdom, alluding to “a particular problem in which your assistance would be of the greatest help.”</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">James Chadwick, photographed circa 1945. <em>Los Alamos National Laboratory</em> </span></figure><p>Chadwick, his fellow Nobel Laureate for his discovery of the neutron, was leading Britain’s research into the atomic bomb.</p><p>Again, Bohr politely declined, feeling he could do more good in occupied Denmark, but he was in no doubt about the nature of the “particular problem” his friend alluded to. He just didn’t believe that given the current state of the art, an atomic bomb was feasible.</p><p>Two months later Bohr reported to Chadwick that new information had convinced him that Germany had established the means to develop a nuclear reactor using uranium and heavy water. But as the British scientist prepared to take on a new role as head of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, it still wasn’t enough to persuade the ‘Great Dane,’ as he was known to SOE, to leave Copenhagen.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">Supervised by the U.S. Army, the German experimental nuclear reactor is dismantled at Haigerloch, southwest Germany, in April 1945. <em>U.S. Army</em><br><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Irving"></a> </span></figure><p>It wasn’t until a Danish woman working for the Gestapo saw an order for Bohr’s arrest and tipped off Bohr’s brother, Harald, that the physicist finally accepted that he had to go. Evidence of imminent action by the Nazis against Denmark’s Jewish community and the threat to him specifically was now impossible to ignore. Senior SS personnel poured into Copenhagen. A large German ship, the <em>Wartheland</em>, was alongside harbor, ready to carry as many of the country’s 7,000 Jews as could be packed in.</p><p>Bohr and his wife, Margarethe, left their home at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2012/11/28/for-winning-the-nobel-prize-niels-bohr-got-a-house-with-free-beer/">the Carlsberg brewery estate</a> within hours of the tip-off from Harald. As they slipped out of the back of their house a Nazi snatch squad was already on its way. When the couple later crawled on all-fours from a beach hut to a waiting boat, the most famous man in Denmark had with him a single bag, a beer bottle full of heavy water retrieved from the lab, and a sketch purporting to be of the Nazi’s reactor design. There had been no time to gather any more possessions before being smuggled across the strait to Sweden.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A German general decorating with the Iron Cross some soldiers of the Expeditionary Force and two soldiers of the SS, in Denmark, April 1940. <em>Photo by Mondadori via Getty Images</em> </span></figure><p>Niels and Margarethe Bohr may have thought that, with their arrival in Malmø, they were safe from the clutches of the Nazis, but that was neither how the Gestapo nor Danish Army intelligence saw the situation.</p><p>Like Madrid, Lisbon, or Casablanca, the capital of neutral Sweden was a hotbed of wartime intrigue, with spies from intelligence agencies from around the world operating side-by-side all competing for advantage. Secrets, lies, treachery, and deception were all common currency in Stockholm, and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutout_(espionage)">cutouts</a>, agents, safe houses, dead drops, surveillance, and ciphers were the means by which they were traded. And with the arrival of the world’s most celebrated nuclear physicist, they had a prize worth playing for. </p><p>At first, the Swedish authorities were reluctant to acknowledge that Bohr was at risk of abduction or assassination, telling the Danish Army captain charged with his protection, “This is Stockholm, not Chicago.”</p><p>When it came to ruthlessness and brutality, the officer replied, there was no gangster that could compare to the Gestapo, and that “if anything happens to the professor it will be a disgrace to your country.” The captain never left Bohr’s side while he was in Sweden. But from now on, he was also joined by three armed Swedish secret police. Arriving in Stockholm, Bohr was bundled from a taxi into a house owned by Swedish intelligence, led through the attics to the other side of the building, and met by a second taxi, which took him to a safe house.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">The Danish scientist Niels Bohr in his laboratory in the 1940s. <em>Photo by Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images</em> </span></figure><p>Three days later, the Nazis moved against <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yadvashem.org/articles/academic/denmark-and-the-holocaust.html">Denmark’s Jews</a> as planned, but it was already too late. Alerted, like Bohr, to the imminent danger, they were taken in, hidden, and, over time, evacuated by their countrymen. Sweden, after lobbying from Bohr himself, agreed to take them all in. Of Denmark’s 7,000 or so Jews, just 284 of the weakest and most vulnerable had been arrested.</p><p>It wasn’t even enough, remarked a crestfallen Nazi official “to justify the dispatch of a train to the concentration camp.”</p><p>For Bohr himself to reach ultimate safety, he would now be relying on the ‘Stockholm Express.’ And, despite the name, it was not a train, but one of a small fleet of unarmed de Havilland Mosquito aircraft that, operated by British Airways’ precursor, BOAC — the British Overseas Airways Corporation — ran the gauntlet of Luftwaffe night-fighters to carry VIP passengers between RAF Leuchars in Scotland and Sweden’s Bromma Airport. Those passengers rode in the claustrophobic confines of the Masquitos' felt-lined bomb bays. The flight nearly killed Bohr. And for that, the Mosquito’s peerless performance was to blame. That bundling a VIP into the belly of a warplane was even an option was all down to ball bearings.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">BOAC Mosquitos carried a single passenger in the felt-lined bomb bay. They were given oxygen, a reading light, a blanket, and a flask of coffee for the two-and-a-half-hour flight. <em>Crown Copyright</em> </span></figure><p>For 35 years, the Swedish company SKF had led the world in the production of quality ball bearings, opening factories in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and the United States. But with the advent of World War II, their plant in Luton, England, despite working day and night, couldn’t keep up with demand.</p><p>Each <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/35474/the-british-had-a-plan-to-drop-anthrax-laced-cattle-feed-over-germany-in-1942">Avro Lancaster bomber</a> for the RAF required over 175 pounds of quality ball bearings and these aircraft were rolling off the production line at a rate of around 25 a week. But there were also Spitfires, Hurricanes, and plenty more besides. Britain had a huge variety of aircraft types in production, powered by a wide variety of different engines, and <em>all</em> required ball bearings of their own. Nor was it just aircraft. Tanks, armored cars, warships, and anti-aircraft guns all needed ball bearings. In fact, there were very few pieces of complex military machinery that <em>didn’t</em>. And that, of course, included the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/21198/listen-to-a-p-82-twin-mustang-pur-a-glorious-sound-not-heard-in-over-30-years">Merlin-engined</a> Mosquito itself.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A scene from an SKF ball-bearing plant, photographed soon after World War II. <em>Photo by Walter Nurnberg/SSPL/Getty Images</em> </span></figure><p>SOE ships carrying Swedish ball bearings first successfully ran the German blockade of the Skagerrak — the strait providing access between the North Sea and Sweden — in 1941. Since June 1942, though, BOAC had been running semi-regular courier flights along the 500-mile route between RAF Leuchars and Stockholm. The airbridge, so critical to both British intelligence and war industry, crossed some of the most hostile and heavily defended skies in the world, yet BOAC had struggled to find an aircraft to serve its needs.</p><p>To begin with, the airline was given cast-off <a target="_blank" href="https://www.baesystems.com/en/heritage/armstrong-whitworth-aw38-whitley">Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys</a>. Slow and vulnerable, the obsolete RAF bombers were soon dispensed with in favor of new types acquired from the United States, small Lockheed Lodestars and Hudsons and a one-off, <em>St. Louis</em>, the first prototype of the new Curtiss C-46 Commando transport. The C-46 was capable of carrying heavy loads but remained vulnerable to the Luftwaffe. So too were the Douglas DC-3s that replaced it in the spring of 1943.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">The BOAC-operated Curtiss CW-20A (the prototype of the C-46), G-AGDI, named <em>St. Louis</em>, is refueled at Gibraltar, in 1941 or 1942. <em>Crown Copyright</em> </span></figure><p>At Leuchars, BOAC was very firmly of the view that “the Skagerrak is no place for a Dak” — a reference to the vulnerability of the Dakota, as the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/39236/theres-one-place-in-the-world-where-ac-47-spooky-gunships-still-fly">DC-3/C-47</a> was known in British service. But in the spring of 1943, the pressure to keep up the flights only intensified with a telegram from the British Minister in Stockholm, Sir Victor Mallett:</p><p><em>“Since the need for at least 100 tons of bearings is desperate I recommend that risks should be taken as in any other wartime operation and that freight aircraft without passengers should fly regardless of bright nights throughout the summer months. If the Germans take to shooting them down the position can be reconsidered and at the worst, we will have lost one or two Dakotas and crews.”</em></p><p>BOAC disagreed and, after trialing an alternative route to Sweden, concluded in a report that what was required was “an aircraft with great performance — speed, higher ceiling, and more endurance.”</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">No. 105 Squadron Mosquito B.IVs. The B.IV was the first Mosquito to enter service with BOAC and remained popular with crews after the introduction of the&nbsp;subsequent FB.VI&nbsp;because it was a few miles per hour faster. <em>Crown Copyright</em> </span></figure><p>When, in 1938, as the prospect of war loomed over Europe, Geoffrey de Havilland first suggested the idea of a lightweight twin-engine bomber to the U.K. Air Ministry he was met with little enthusiasm. Undeterred, he decided that his company would build it anyway. And, if the new machine was built from wood, he knew he would not only be able to get it into production much more quickly than a metal design but would also avoid making any demand on vital supplies of the aluminum required to build every other military aircraft.

Impressed as a young pilot in the Royal Flying Corps (the RAF’s immediate successor) by the performance of an earlier de Havilland bomber design, Freeman circumvented the objections of Bomber Command to the notion of an unarmed bomber by ordering 50 of de Havilland’s sleek new Mosquitos to fulfill a separate RAF requirement for high-flying spyplanes.</p><p>Powered by two Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, the Mosquito was capable of flying to Berlin and back with the same 4,000-pound bombload as Boeing’s <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/41454/the-b-17-bombers-combat-debut-80-years-ago-today-was-a-fiasco">B-17 Flying Fortress</a> yet flown by a crew of two instead of 10.</p><div data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/embed"><p itemprop="associatedMedia"><iframe frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JTsnMKzmdWs?feature=oembed&amp;rel=0&amp;enablejsapi=1" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><p>Following a remarkable flying display laid on for Gen. Hap Arnold, the head of the United States Army Air Corps, in April 1941, he rated it “outstanding” and insisted on taking a set of the blueprints home with him. Three months later, in the same week that it entered frontline service, a Mosquito recorded a top speed of 433 miles per hour at a time when the RAF’s top fighter, the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/39633/yes-the-u-s-navy-also-took-the-spitfire-into-battle-during-world-war-ii">Spitfire Mk V</a>, topped out at 370 miles per hour. Suddenly everyone wanted the Mosquito and because of its unique wood and glue construction, furniture factories, cabinetmakers, and musical instrument manufacturers around Britain were able to put their carpentry-skilled workforces to work helping keep up with demand.</p><p>After first entering RAF service with a photo-reconnaissance unit in the summer of 1941, the first Mosquito bomber squadron formed a few months later. No. 105 Squadron’s operations remained classified for nearly a year until, in September 1942, after a low-level raid on a Gestapo HQ in Oslo, the Mosquito’s existence was revealed to the public in enthusiastic reports that noted its ability to “outpace the latest Focke-Wulf [Fw 190].”</p><p>And that was exactly what BOAC needed.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A Luftwaffe Focke-Wulf Fw 190 at its airbase.

Although not immune to the attentions of the German fighter squadrons that pincered the route, the Mosquitos, their camouflaged wings overpainted top and bottom with their civilian registration in huge letters and the airline’s iconic <a target="_blank" href="https://londonairtravel.com/2019/08/11/british-airways-100-years-theyre-lee-elliotts-speedbird/">‘speedbird’ logo</a> on the nose, at least loaded the odds in favor of the airline pilots.</p><p>A single Mosquito could carry a load of 1,400 pounds of Swedish ball bearings packed in cases and stowed in the bomb bay, but its speed meant it could complete two or even three runs between Leuchars and Stockholm in a single night. In June of 1943, the airline’s Mosquito fleet completed 30 round trips to help chip away at Britain’s ball-bearing deficit, but their greater contribution was made through a single, game-changing flight at the end of the month.</p><p>Henry Waring and Ville Siberg had been kicking their heels in St. Andrews, on Scotland’s east coast, for nearly a week. Waring, a representative of the British Iron and Steel Corps, and his colleague, who ran SKF’s Luton factory, knew valuable time was being wasted. Ball bearings from neutral Sweden were supplied on a first-come, first-served basis and it was understood in London that the Germans, after Allied bombing of their own ball-bearing factories, were on the verge of placing a large order. Twice Waring phoned London urging action but was told that long, hot summer days and a complete lack of cloud cover meant attempting the flight in the waiting Lockheed 14 would be suicide.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A BOAC Mosquito FB.VI G-AGGD prepares to land. <em>Crown Copyright </em> </span></figure><p>Waring was sunbathing by the swimming pool when, on June 24, an RAF driver pulled up at the hotel. Still in his swimming trunks, Waring was taken to Leuchars and informed that he and Siberg would be traveling to Sweden that night in a pair of hastily adapted BOAC Mosquitos.</p><p>Each fortified by a stiff whisky before departure, the two businessmen reached Bromma just hours before the German negotiating team to secure SKF’s ball bearings for the Allies, and, as well as catering for British requirements, also deliberately placed&nbsp;orders for gauges they believed were in short supply in the Reich. Their safe delivery was recorded on the freight manifest as “one package Waring, one package Siberg.”</p><p>Geoffrey de Havilland once wrote that “if the size is right, the aeroplane becomes very versatile.” But the Mosquito had a sort of Goldilocks quality to it. It could do anything. Doctrine has it that there are four roles of air power: control of the air; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; attack; and mobility. Broadly speaking, an air force requires fighters, spyplanes, bombers, and transport aircraft to perform these tasks, each usually requiring very different characteristics in an airframe. Prior to 1943, though, the Mosquito had already made its mark as an exceptional example of the first three.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A BOAC Mosquito pilot climbing aboard an FB.VI. Note the four sealed 20mm cannon gun ports in the nose. <em>Crown Copyright</em> </span></figure><p>In going on to drop a total of nearly 27,000 tons of bombs on the enemy, Mosquitos suffered fewer losses per thousand sorties than any other aircraft in Bomber Command. And so accurate were they that, after the campaign to destroy <a target="_blank" href="https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/v-1-cruise-missile/nasm_A19600341000">V-1 flying-bomb</a> launch sites in the autumn of 1942, records showed that Mosquito crews required less than a quarter of the tonnage of bombs to destroy each target than the next most effective bomber. There were single nights on either side of D-Day when Mosquito fighter-bombers would destroy nearly a thousand separate pieces of German motor transport.</p><p>As heavily armed eight-gun fighters — especially as radar-equipped night-fighters — Mosquitos shot down over 800 enemy aircraft. Such was the fear that they induced within the Luftwaffe in the latter stages of the war as they loitered around German airfields after dark, ready to pounce on anything coming in or out, that the term <em>Moskitopanik</em> was coined.</p><p>Flying photo-reconnaissance missions, Mosquitos crisscrossed Europe with near impunity gathering critical photographic intelligence that, among other things, helped delay the threat from Hitler’s <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/the-v-2-rocket-changing-the-trajectory-of-warfare">V-2 ballistic missile</a>. In assuming the mantle of airliner/transport for BOAC between Leuchars and Stockholm, the Mosquito became perhaps the only machine in history to successfully combine all four of these essential roles.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">BOAC crew with an RAF Flying Control officer at RAF Leuchars before departing for Stockholm. <em>Crown Copyright</em> </span></figure><p>In the six months that followed Waring and Viberg’s flight, Mosquitos flew another 129 round trips to Sweden and hauled back over 100 tons of ball bearings. But it was the human cargoes they carried to and from Scandinavia that really distinguished the British and Norwegian civilian pilots and radio operators employed by BOAC. As well as maintaining the flow of intelligence and personnel to and from Sweden, and by extension, Denmark, they were also responsible for repatriating downed Allied aircrews, many of whom had been spirited out of Denmark to Sweden by local resistance groups.</p><p>A little before 6:30 a.m. at Bromma Airport on October 6, 1943, the crew of BOAC Mosquito FB.VI G-AGGG installed Niels Bohr in the bomb bay and briefed him on how to use the intercom and oxygen system. They said they would tell him when he was required to switch it on. He was given flares and a parachute in case they had to abandon the aircraft, then sealed into the claustrophobically compact space for the duration of the two-and-a-half-hour flight.</p><p>Climbing west through 15,000 feet towards the thin air of what mountaineers call the death zone near 25,000 feet, the BOAC crew was confident that, behind them, Bohr would follow his instructions. Unknown to them, the leather flying helmet that contained his intercom didn’t fit easily over the scientist’s large head, so he couldn’t hear them. Nor did Bohr, who could be remarkably unworldly, properly understand how to use the oxygen.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">A BOAC Mosquito lines up for takeoff from RAF Leuchars in Scotland. <em>Crown Copyright</em> </span></figure><p>When the radio operator asked how he was getting on there was no answer from the bomb bay. He feared that Bohr had passed out through oxygen starvation. But until G-AGGG had swept through the jaws of the German air defenses ranged to the north and south, they had to stay high.</p><p>Two and half hours after taking off from Bromma, after completing the final leg of the journey low over the North Sea, the Mosquito FB.VI landed at RAF Leuchars and taxied towards an anxious crowd waiting by the terminal. Where, to their great relief, the Great Dane, weak but alive, was liberated from the belly of the aircraft. </p><p>The following month Bohr sailed for America, arriving at Los Alamos to join the Manhattan Project in the new year. Here, as historian Alex Wellerstein&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2015/05/11/bohr-at-los-alamos/">writes</a>, Bohr’s contribution to building the first functional nuclear devices was highly significant, although subsequently underplayed.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">Capt.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>The Busemann-Petty problem (posed in 1956) has an interesting history. It asks the following question: if $K$ and $L$ are two origin-symmetric convex bodies in $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that the volume of each central hyperplane section of $K$ is less than the volume of the corresponding section of $L$:
$$\operatorname{Vol}_{n-1}(K\cap \xi^\perp)\le \operatorname{Vol}_{n-1}(L\cap \xi^\perp)\qquad\text{for all } \xi\in S^{n-1},$$
does it follow that the volume of $K$ is less than the volume of $L$: $\operatorname{Vol}_n(K)\le \operatorname{Vol}_n(L)?$</p>

<p>Many mathematician's gut reaction to the question is that the answer must be yes and Minkowski's uniqueness theorem provides some mathematical justification for such a belief---Minkwoski's uniqueness theorem implies that an origin-symmetric star body in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is completely determined by the volumes of its central hyperplane sections, so these volumes of central hyperplane sections <em>do</em> contain a vast amount of information about the bodies. It was widely believed that the answer to the Busemann-Problem must be true, even though it was still a largely unopened conjecture.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in 1975 everyone was caught off-guard when Larman and Rogers produced a counter-example showing that the assertion is false in $n \ge 12$ dimensions. Their counter-example was quite complicated, but in 1986, Keith Ball proved that the maximum hyperplane section of the unit cube is $\sqrt{2}$ regardless of the dimension, and a consequence of this is that the centered unit cube and a centered ball of suitable radius provide a counter-example when $n \ge 10$. Some time later Giannopoulos and Bourgain (independently) gave counter-examples for $n\ge 7$, and then Papadimitrakis and Gardner (independently) gave counter-examples for $n=5,6$.</p>

<p>By 1992 only the three and four dimensional cases of the Busemann-Petty problem remained unsolved, since the problem is trivially true in two dimensions and by that point counter-examples had been found for all $n\ge 5$. 
Around this time theory had been developed connecting the problem with the notion of an "intersection body". Lutwak proved that if the body with smaller sections is an intersection body then the conclusion of the Busemann-Petty problem follows. Later work by Grinberg, Rivin, Gardner, and Zhang strengthened the connection and established that the Busemann-Petty problem has an affirmative answer in $\mathbb{R}^n$ iff every origin-symmetric convex body in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is an intersection body. But the question of whether a body is an intersection body is closely related to the positivity of the inverse spherical Radon transform. In 1994, Richard Gardner used geometric methods to invert the spherical Radon transform in three dimensions in such a way to prove that the problem has an <em>affirmative</em> answer in three dimensions (which was surprising since all of the results up to that point had been <em>negative</em>). Then in 1994, Gaoyong Zhang published a paper (in the Annals of Mathematics) which claimed to prove that the unit cube in $\mathbb{R}^4$ is not an intersection body and as a consequence that the problem has a negative answer in $n=4$.</p>

<p>For three years everyone believed the problem had been solved, but in 1997 Alexander Koldobsky (who was working on completely different problems) provided a new Fourier analytic approach to convex bodies and in particular established a very convenient Fourier analytic characterization of intersection bodies. Using his new characterization he showed that the unit cube in $\mathbb{R}^4$ <em>is</em> an intersection body, contradicting Zhang's earlier claim. It turned out that Zhang's paper was incorrect and this re-opened the Busemann-Petty problem again.</p>

<p>After learning that Koldobsky's results contradicted his claims, Zhang quickly proved that in fact every origin-symmetric convex body in $\mathbb{R}^4$ <em>is</em> an intersection body and hence that the Busemann-Petty problem has an affirmative answer in $\mathbb{R}^4$---the opposite of what he had previously claimed. This later paper was also published in the Annals, and so Zhang may be perhaps the only person to have published in such a prestigious journal both that $P$ and that $\neg P$!</p>

But the UK’s train passengers are far from the only ones in Europe facing rail problems.</p><p>Germany’s railways, once a source of national pride, have become something of an embarrassment in a country with a reputation for efficiency and engineering prowess.

Meanwhile passengers in neighbouring Austria are complaining about the knock-on effect of hold-ups across the border, and Switzerland’s famously punctual railways have stopped waiting for the arrival of connections from Germany.</p><p>It was not always thus. Teacher Max Winter, 43, did not think twice about accepting a job at a school in the city of Wolfsburg, despite it being more than 140 miles from his home in Berlin, because Wolfsburg was on the line between the capital and Hanover, and there were regular rail services.</p><p>“I didn’t consider it a big distance,” he says. “At the start I never thought about it, or even considered moving to Wolfsburg.”</p><p>When he began his daily commute in January 2016, he had few problems with the hour-long journey on a high-speed intercity train, bookended by cycle rides. The trip would have taken three times as long by car.</p><p>“In the past few years it has really changed, and I can’t defend Deutsche Bahn any more,” he says.</p><p>Despite paying some €4,400 for an annual season ticket, in recent months Winter has had to put up with a weeks-long closure of the track between Wolfsburg and Berlin for upgrades, coupled with delays, cancelled trains and lack of staff. At one point, the father-of-one even had to temporarily rent a room in Wolfsburg to ensure he could make it to work.</p><p>Back in western Germany Birgit Schmitt-Janssen, 61, also feels let down. “You can 100% count on Deutsche Bahn to be late,” she laughs. “It’s the same daily misery.”</p><p>She does not have a driving licence, and describes herself as “dependent” on Deutsche Bahn for the daily 13-mile commute from her home in Mönchengladbach to her office in the town of Krefeld.</p><p>Schmitt-Janssen, who volunteers with passenger group Pro Bahn, says the journey, which she has made for the past nine years, has been unreliable ever since the staffing shortages that followed the pandemic. “I get really annoyed when I’m standing on the platform and it becomes clear there are lots of delays,” says, adding that rail replacement buses could double the length of her commute.</p><p>“You get the feeling they run through a catalogue of excuses. Today it was damaged signal boxes, tomorrow they’ll say it was defective train doors, and the following day it’ll be an earlier train running late. Everyone on the platform says, ‘oh, not again.’”</p><p>Frustrated passengers regularly take to social media to share complaints or <a href="https://twitter.com/AmreiBahr/status/1679529846395764736" data-link-name="in body link">joke about the most improbable reason</a> they’ve been given for a disrupted service.</p><p>The extent of Deutsche Bahn’s problems is not just anecdotal. Official figures showed record delays in 2022, when more than a third of long-distance trains ran late, and delays to regional and freight trains became more frequent.</p><figure id="6b6123aa-2fe0-4361-8e43-7d5dc5386d40" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff4c8186173fa00bc65926ac5b02b6179649d93e/0_3_7478_4486/master/7478.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff4c8186173fa00bc65926ac5b02b6179649d93e/0_3_7478_4486/master/7478.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff4c8186173fa00bc65926ac5b02b6179649d93e/0_3_7478_4486/master/7478.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff4c8186173fa00bc65926ac5b02b6179649d93e/0_3_7478_4486/master/7478.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff4c8186173fa00bc65926ac5b02b6179649d93e/0_3_7478_4486/master/7478.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff4c8186173fa00bc65926ac5b02b6179649d93e/0_3_7478_4486/master/7478.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Engineering work on Germany’s tracks" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff4c8186173fa00bc65926ac5b02b6179649d93e/0_3_7478_4486/master/7478.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="266.9523936881519" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Engineering work on Germany’s tracks can mean lines close for weeks.</span> Photograph: Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>But things <a href="https://www.deutschebahn.com/de/konzern/konzernprofil/zahlen_fakten/puenktlichkeitswerte-6878476" data-link-name="in body link">have got worse</a> in recent months: more than 36% of long-distance trains were delayed in August, along with almost 9% of regional trains. This was blamed on the high volume of building work across the rail network – despite the company giving itself the buffer of saying passenger trains are on time if they are less than six minutes late.</p><p>Germany may be the home of an ever-powerful carmaking lobby and an <em>autobahn </em>which includes some sections free of speed limits, but it is also heavily reliant on its extensive rail network.</p><p>It connects the country’s major cities – Hamburg to Munich, Frankfurt to Berlin – to each other and to the rest of the continent, although the track network has in fact been shrinking for years.</p><p>Many believe that decades of chronic underinvestment have now come home to roost, with the railways becoming a symbol of Germany’s creaking infrastructure – alongside motorways and bridges – at a time of economic malaise. The IMF and OECD have warned that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/19/germany-world-economic-slowdown-oecd-interest-rates-china" data-link-name="in body link">country will be a laggard among the world’s leading economies this year</a>.</p><p>It also comes as many are reassessing the priorities pursued during the Angela Merkel years, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/09/neckarwestheim-delay-phasing-out-nuclear-power-dividing-german-village" data-link-name="in body link">including the country’s energy policy</a> and its dealings with Russia.</p><p>Deutsche Bahn is in its biggest crisis since its creation almost 30 years ago, in the 1994 “rail reform” that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification.</p><p>The company, formed from the existing West and East German railways, was freed from previous debts with the idea that it would be able, in time, to become profitable, with the goal of boosting Germany’s GDP and floating on the stock market.</p><p>Except it did not quite work out that way. Unlike other similarly privatised companies such as <a href="https://www.telekom.com/en/media/media-information/archive/25-years-of-deutsche-telekom-ag-589922" data-link-name="in body link">Deutsche Telekom and the postal service Deutsche Post, which successfully went public</a>, Deutsche Bahn remains in government hands.</p><p>Its company structure is unusual in that it has one sole owner, shareholder and financial backer: the German state. Indeed, the German constitution requires the government to retain majority ownership of the national railway infrastructure.</p><p>Critics have blamed this arrangement for what they see as Deutsche Bahn’s major failings, such as its decision to expand its global operations while ignoring its main objective and responsibility to German taxpayers: the operation of Germany’s rail network.</p><p>“It is very clear that the company’s core business, rail in Germany, has to be its focus,” says Kay Scheller, the president of Germany’s federal audit office, from his office overlooking the Rhine in Bonn. “We have all the disadvantages of this company structure, without the benefits.”</p><p>Since 1994, Deutsche Bahn has ballooned into an international transport giant: passengers in 10 European countries ride on buses run by its Arriva subsidiary, which also operates London Overground trains for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Transport</a> for London, while its Schenker division handles international air, land and sea freight.</p><p>The German transport ministry, which has responsibility for Deutsche Bahn, stands accused of years of failure to get a grip on the company’s management and operations, all while stumping up funding.</p><p>Scheller says: “The German federal government needs to coordinate the company more, and steer it more.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2021/03/07/copy-elision-borks-escape-analysis/">https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2021/03/07/copy-elision-borks-escape-analysis/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37881699">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Yesterday Lauri Vasama showed me <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/jG7x5h">this awesome Godbolt</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>struct S {
    static std::unique_ptr&lt;S&gt; make() noexcept;
    ~S();

    static std::unique_ptr&lt;S&gt; factory() {
        std::unique_ptr&lt;S&gt; s = S::make();
        return M(s);
    }
};

void take_ownership(S*) noexcept;

void test() {
    std::unique_ptr&lt;S&gt; p = S::factory();
    take_ownership(p.release());
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>When <code>M(s)</code> is defined as <code>std::move(s)</code>, Clang gives pretty much optimal codegen
for <code>test</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>  pushq %rax
  movq %rsp, %rdi
  callq S::make()
  movq (%rsp), %rdi
  callq take_ownership(S*)
  popq %rax
  retq
</code></pre></div>

<p>But by defining <code>M(s)</code> as <code>std::move(s)</code>, we’re actually creating a return statement
of the form <code>return std::move(s)</code>, which is widely known as an antipattern in C++.
Returning “by <code>move</code>” disables <a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2019/08/02/the-tough-guide-to-cpp-acronyms/#rvo-nrvo-urvo">RVO</a>,
and even when RVO doesn’t happen, <code>return std::move(x)</code> is (in 99% of cases)
no more efficient than <code>return x</code>, because <code>return x</code> triggers a special case in the
standard known as “implicit move,” which means that the copy into the return slot uses
the <em>move</em> constructor, not the <em>copy</em> constructor, even though the returned expression
<code>x</code> is totally an lvalue.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have a proposal before EWG right now —
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p2266r0.html">P2266</a> —
which in C++23 will make that <code>x</code> into an rvalue, literally. This radically simplifies
the wording and compiler implementation around “implicit move.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, so, let’s get rid of that “return by <code>move</code>.” Let’s define <code>M(s)</code> to just <code>(s)</code>,
and see what happens. (Here’s the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/jG7x5h">Godbolt</a> again.)</p>

<div><pre><code>  pushq %rbx
  subq $16, %rsp
  leaq 8(%rsp), %rdi
  callq S::make()
  movq 8(%rsp), %rdi
  movq $0, 8(%rsp)
  callq take_ownership(S*)
  movq 8(%rsp), %rbx
  testq %rbx, %rbx
  je .LBB0_2
  movq %rbx, %rdi
  callq S::~S() [complete object destructor]
  movq %rbx, %rdi
  callq operator delete(void*)
.LBB0_2:
  addq $16, %rsp
  popq %rbx
  retq
</code></pre></div>

<p>Whoa! The code got way longer! What happened?</p>

<hr>

<p>What happened was <em>copy elision.</em> When the body of <code>factory</code> was this:</p>

<div><pre><code>static std::unique_ptr&lt;S&gt; factory() {
    std::unique_ptr&lt;S&gt; s = S::make();
    return std::move(s);
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>the meaning was “Create an object named <code>s</code>, whose initial value comes from
being used as the return slot of <code>S::make()</code>. Then, construct the object
in my own return slot by calling <code>S</code>’s move constructor on xvalue <code>s</code>.”</p>

<p>When the body of <code>factory</code> changed to this:</p>

<div><pre><code>static std::unique_ptr&lt;S&gt; factory() {
    std::unique_ptr&lt;S&gt; s = S::make();
    return s;
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>the meaning changed as well, to “<em>Either</em> do the same thing as above; <em>or</em>,
let <code>s</code> be another name for my return slot, and give it its initial value by
using it as the return slot of <code>S::make()</code>.” In the latter case we’ve gone
from having “<code>s</code>” and “my return slot” be two separate objects, to having
them be one single object. This is normally a big performance win; we like it.</p>

<p>But in this case, this optimization interfered with Clang’s <em>escape analysis</em>.
Escape analysis is the thing that tells us, in</p>

<div><pre><code>void f(int);
int test() {
    int x = 42;
    f(x);
    return x + 1;  // i.e., return 43
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>that <code>x</code> must still be 42 after the call to <code>f</code>, because
(even though we don’t know what that function does in general) we know it
can’t modify <code>x</code>, because it doesn’t know <code>x</code>’s address on our stack.
Escape analysis tracks everything we do with <code>x</code>’s address, and can prove
in this case that that address has never <em>escaped</em> into the wider world.</p>

<p>However, if you change <code>f</code> to take its parameter as <code>const int&amp;</code>,
then <code>x</code>’s stack address <em>does</em> escape, and so the compiler can’t assume
the value of <code>x</code> remains unchanged after the call to <code>other_function</code>:
it must reload <code>x</code> from memory and actually compute that addition.
(<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/751Yc3">Godbolt.</a>) Because <code>f</code> might do</p>

<div><pre><code>void f(const int&amp; x) {
    *const_cast&lt;int*&gt;(&amp;x) = 918;
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Even worse, consider this caller:</p>

<div><pre><code>void g(const int&amp;);
void h();
int test() {
    int x = 0;
    g(x);
    x = 42;
    h();
    return x + 1;
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>In this case, <code>h</code> doesn’t even receive <code>x</code>’s address… yet <code>h</code> can still
modify <code>x</code>, because by this point <code>x</code>’s address has already escaped! <code>g</code> and <code>h</code>
might collude together:</p>

<div><pre><code>int *global;
void g(const int&amp; x) {
    global = const_cast&lt;int*&gt;(&amp;x);
}
void h() {
    *global = 918;
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>The compiler’s escape analysis cannot rule out this possibility, and so,
<em>for all the compiler knows,</em> it might be the truth! After the call to <code>h</code>,
the compiler cannot assume that <code>x</code>’s value remains 42.</p>

<hr>

<p>Back to our <code>unique_ptr</code> example.</p>

<div><pre><code>struct S {
    static std::unique_ptr&lt;S&gt; make() noexcept;
    ~S();

    static std::unique_ptr&lt;S&gt; factory() {
        std::unique_ptr&lt;S&gt; s = S::make();
        return M(s);
    }
};

void take_ownership(S*) noexcept;

void test() {
    std::unique_ptr&lt;S&gt; p = S::factory();
    take_ownership(p.release());
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Escape analysis reasons as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The address of <code>factory</code>’s stack variable <code>s</code> escapes into <code>S::make</code>,
  as part of the calling convention for how <code>S::make</code> returns its prvalue
  result. We don’t know what <code>S::make</code> does with that address.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later, we null out <code>test</code>’s stack variable <code>p</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, we call <code>take_ownership</code>. We don’t know what it does.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, we destroy <code>p</code>, which is a no-op if and only if <code>p</code> is still null.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Could <code>take_ownership</code> affect <code>p</code>’s value, the way <code>h</code> affected <code>x</code>’s value in our
simpler example? Or can we assume that <code>p</code>’s value is definitely still null?
In short: does <code>p</code>’s address <em>escape?</em></p>

<p>Well, <code>p</code> is just another name for the return slot of <code>S::factory</code>.
When <code>S::factory</code> returns “by <code>move</code>,” it is constructing that object <em>right there</em>,
using the move-constructor of <code>unique_ptr</code>, which is fine for escape analysis
because that move-constructor is <code>inline</code> — we know what it does, and it <em>doesn’t</em>
stash any addresses in global variables. So <code>p</code>’s address doesn’t escape, which
means that <code>take_ownership</code> can’t possibly have access to <code>p</code>, which means that
<code>p</code> is still null when <code>take_ownership</code> returns, which means that we don’t need
to reload its value nor generate any code to call <code>delete</code> on it if it’s non-null.</p>

<p>But, when <code>S::factory</code> returns “by name,” copy elision kicks in. Now the returned
variable <code>s</code> becomes an alias for the object in <code>factory</code>’s return slot (which
you’ll recall is already an alias for <code>p</code>). And <code>s</code>’s address <em>does</em> escape —
it escapes into <code>S::make</code>!</p>

<p>Suppose <code>S::make</code> and <code>take_ownership</code> were secretly colluding, like this:</p>

<div><pre><code>std::unique_ptr&lt;S&gt; *global;

std::unique_ptr&lt;S&gt; S::make() {
    std::unique_ptr&lt;S&gt; origp = std::make_unique&lt;S&gt;();
    global = &amp;origp;
    return origp;
}

void take_ownership(S *rawp) {
    delete rawp;
    *global = std::make_unique&lt;S&gt;();
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>The compiler cannot rule out this possibility, and so it must assume that calling
<code>take_ownership</code> might repopulate the stack variable <code>p</code> with a new value.
So it generates all that extra code in <code>test</code> to reload, check, and possibly <code>delete</code>
the value of <code>p</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Clang and ICC behave pretty uniformly as described in this blog post.
GCC “succeeds” in generating good code for both variations of the Godbolt above (with
or without <code>std::move</code>), but this appears to be <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48749440/c-nrvo-copy-elision-with-return-statement-in-parentheses">due to a GCC bug</a> —
it thinks <code>return (s)</code> with parentheses is a request to disable copy elision!
A slight tweak to my <code>M</code> macro, to remove the redundant parentheses,
and GCC joins the pack: <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/361sfY">Godbolt</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>It would be interesting to see a compiler patch that instrumented escape analysis somehow,
so that it could give an optimization-time note such as “Object <code>x</code>’s address escapes only
because copy elision in <code>f</code> gave <code>x</code> the same address as object <code>y</code>.” I think that would happen
a lot, and certainly isn’t something you’d want to see in your daily builds; but it might be
very interesting to trawl through the output.</p>

<hr>

<p>Anton Zhilin’s <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2025r1.html">P2025R1 “Guaranteed copy elision for return variables”</a>
(June 2020) talks a bit about escape analysis in section 6.5, “What about the invalidation of optimizations?”
The more we expand the scope of copy-elision, the easier it will be for copy-elision to bump up against
escape analysis. The example dissected in today’s blog post is interesting precisely <em>because</em> it is
obscure and happens so rarely.</p>

<p>Please do not use this post as evidence that copy elision is bad! Copy elision is awesome!
Mainly this post is an interesting piece of trivia. But, secondarily, if any change to C++ <em>is</em> needed
in this area, it would be <em>tightening up the object model</em> so that escape analysis could
become more aggressive. I hope we all agree that the kind of “collusion” shown in this post is
terribly contrived, and nothing of value would be lost if C++ disallowed it. Escape analysis should
not allow for the possibility that a function has “remembered” the address of its own prvalue return
slot.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-4071644285770837621" itemprop="description articleBody"><p>
You might think of the Intel 386 processor (1985) as just an early processor in the x86
line, but the 386 was a critical turning point for modern computing in several ways.<span id="fnref:second-source"><a href="#fn:second-source">1</a></span>
First, the 386 moved the x86 architecture to 32 bits, defining the dominant computing
architecture for the rest of the 20th century.
The 386 also established the overwhelming importance of x86, not just for Intel, but for the entire computer
industry.
Finally, the 386 ended IBM's control over the PC market, turning Compaq into the architectural
leader.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I look at die photos of the Intel 386 processor and explain what they reveal
about the history of the processor, such as the move from the 1.5 µm process to the
1 µm process.
You might expect that Intel simply made the same 386 chip at a smaller scale, but there were
substantial changes to the chip's layout, even some visible to the naked eye.<span id="fnref:keychains"><a href="#fn:keychains">2</a></span>
I also look at why the 386 SL had over three times the transistors as the other 386 versions.<span id="fnref:variants"><a href="#fn:variants">3</a></span></p>
<p>The 80386 was a major advancement over the 286: it implemented a 32-bit architecture,
added more instructions, and supported 4-gigabyte segments.
The 386 is a complicated processor (by 1980s standards), with 285,000 transistors, ten times the number of the original 8086.<span id="fnref:transistors"><a href="#fn:transistors">4</a></span>
The 386 has eight logical units
that are pipelined<span id="fnref:parallelism"><a href="#fn:parallelism">5</a></span> and operate mostly autonomously.<span id="fnref:block-diagram"><a href="#fn:block-diagram">6</a></span>
The diagram below shows the internal structure of the 386.<span id="fnref:die-diagram"><a href="#fn:die-diagram">7</a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-versions/386-die-labeled.jpg"><img alt="The 386 with the main functional blocks labeled. Click this image (or any other) for a larger version.

Click this image (or any other) for a larger version. I created this image using a die photo from Antoine Bercovici.</p>
<p>The heart of a processor is the datapath, the components that hold and process data.
In the 386, these components are in the lower left: the ALU (Arithmetic/Logic Unit), a barrel shifter to shift data, and the registers.
These components form regular rectangular blocks, 32 bits wide.
The datapath, along with the circuitry to the left that manages it, forms the Data Unit.
In the lower right is the microcode ROM, which breaks down machine instructions into
micro-instructions, the low-level steps of the instruction.
The microcode ROM, along with the microcode engine circuitry, forms the Control Unit.</p>
<p>The 386 has a complicated instruction format.
The Instruction Decode Unit breaks apart an instruction into its component parts
and generates a pointer to the microcode that implements the instruction.
The instruction queue holds three decoded instructions.
To improve performance, the Prefetch Unit reads instructions from memory before they are
needed, and stores them in the 16-byte prefetch queue.<span id="fnref:queue"><a href="#fn:queue">8</a></span></p>
<!-- Introduction to the 80386 p52 -->

<p>The 386 implements segmented memory and virtual memory, with access protection.<span id="fnref:protection"><a href="#fn:protection">9</a></span>
The Memory Management Unit
consists of the Segment Unit and the Paging Unit:
the Segment Unit translates a logical address to a linear address, while the Paging Unit
translates the linear address to a physical address.
The segment descriptor cache and page cache (TLB) hold data about segments and pages;
the 386 has no on-chip instruction or data cache.<span id="fnref:cache"><a href="#fn:cache">10</a></span>
The Bus Interface Unit in the upper right handles communication between the 386 and the external
memory and devices.</p>
<!--
The 386 can support thousands of segments, with the most recent segment information stored
in the [segment descriptor cache](https://web.archive.org/web/20220405211445/http://www.rcollins.org/ddj/Aug98/Aug98.html).
The 32-entry translation lookaside buffer (TLB or page cache) caches the translation information for
the most recently used pages.
El-Ayat p14 discusses the protection test unit.

<p>Silicon dies are often labeled with the initials of the designers. The 386 DX, however,
has an unusually large number of initials. In the image below, I have enlarged the tiny initials so they are visible.
I think the designers put their initials next to the unit they worked on, but 
I haven't been able to identify most of the names.<span id="fnref:et"><a href="#fn:et">11</a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-versions/386-initials.jpg"><img alt="The 386 die with the initials magnified." height="641" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-versions/386-initials-w600.jpg" title="The 386 die with the initials magnified." width="600"></a></p><p>The 386 die with the initials magnified.</p>
<h2>The shrink from 1.5 µm to 1 µm</h2>
<p>The original 386 was built on a process called CHMOS-III that had 1.5 µm features (specifically the gate channel length for a transistor).
Around 1987, Intel moved to an improved process called CHMOS-IV, with 1 µm features,
permitting a considerably smaller die for the 386.
However, shrinking the layout wasn't a simple mechanical process. Instead, many changes were
made to the chip, as shown in the comparison diagram below.
Most visibly, the Instruction Decode Unit and the Protection Unit in the center-right are
horizontal in the smaller die, rather than vertical.
The standard-cell logic (discussed later) is considerably more dense, probably due to
improved layout algorithms.
The data path (left) was highly optimized in the original so it remained essentially unchanged, but smaller.
One complication is that the bond pads around the border needed to remain the same size so bond wires could be attached.
To fit the pads around the smaller die, many of the pads are staggered.
Because different parts of the die shrank differently, the blocks no longer fit together as compactly, creating wasted space at the bottom of the die.
For some reason, the numerous initials on the original 386 die were removed.
Finally, the new die was labeled 80C386I with a copyright date of 1985, 1987; it is unclear what "C" and "I" indicate.</p>

<p>The change from 1.5 µm to 1 µm may not sound significant, but it reduced the die size by
60%.
This allowed more dies on a wafer, substantially dropping the manufacturing cost.<span id="fnref:wafer"><a href="#fn:wafer">12</a></span>
The strategy of shrinking a processor to a new process before designing a new microarchitecture
for the process became Intel's <a href="https://retailedge.intel.com/content/pdf/asmo/201303art_computerpoweruser.pdf">tick-tock</a> strategy.</p>

<p>In 1988, Intel introduced the 386 SX processor, the low-cost version of the 386,
with a 16-bit bus instead of a 32-bit bus.
(This is reminiscent of the 8088 processor with an 8-bit bus versus the 8086 processor
with a 16-bit bus.)
According to the <a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2015/06/102702019-05-01-acc.pdf#page=25">386 oral history</a>,
the cost of the original 386 die decreased to the point where the chip's package cost about as
much as the die.
By reducing the number of pins, the 386 SX could be put in a one-dollar plastic package
and sold for a considerably reduced price.
The SX allowed Intel to segment the market, moving low-end customers <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=fSMW_RgWwIgC&amp;lpg=PT95&amp;pg=PT94#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">from the 286</a> to the 386 SX, while preserving the
higher sales price of the original 386, now called the DX.<span id="fnref:286"><a href="#fn:286">13</a></span>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/21/science/personal-computers-new-chip-less-cost-for-power.html">In 1988</a>, Intel sold the 386 SX for $219, at least $100 less than the 386 DX.
A complete SX computer could be $1000 cheaper than a similar DX model.</p>

<!-- p25 claim that the 8-bit bus of the 8088 was what tipped the IBM PC processor choice to Intel -->

<p>For compatibility with older 16-bit peripherals, the original 386 was designed to support a mixture of 16-bit and 32-bit buses, dynamically
switching on a cycle-by-cycle basis if needed.
Because 16-bit support was built into the 386, the 386 SX didn't require much design work.
(Unlike the 8088, which required a redesign of the 8086's bus interface unit.)</p>
<p>The 386 SX was built at both 1.5 µm and 1 µm.
The diagram below compares the two sizes of the 386 SX die.
These photos may look identical to the 386 DX photos in the previous section,
but close examination shows a few differences.
Since the 386 SX uses fewer pins, it has fewer bond pads, eliminating the staggered pads of
the shrunk 386 DX.
There are a few differences at the bottom of the chip, with wiring in much of the 386 DX's
wasted space.</p>

<p>Comparing the two SX revisions,
the larger die is labeled "80P9"; Intel's internal name for the chip was "P9", using their
confusing series of <a href="https://www.righto.com/search?q=i960#fn:processor-numbers">P numbers</a>.
The shrunk die is labeled "80386SX", which makes more sense.
The larger die is copyright 1985, 1987, while the shrunk die (which should be newer) is copyright 1985 for some reason.
The larger die has mostly the same initials as the DX, with a few changes.
The shrunk die has about 21 sets of initials.</p>
<h2>The 386 SL die</h2>
<p>The 386 SL (1990) was a major extension to the 386, combining a 386 core and other functions on one chip to save power and space.
Named "SuperSet", it was designed to corner the notebook PC market.<span id="fnref:superset"><a href="#fn:superset">14</a></span>
The 386 SL chip included an ISA bus controller, power management logic, a cache controller 
for an external cache, and the main memory controller.</p>
<p>Looking at the die photo below, the 386 core itself takes up about 1/4 of the SL's die.
The 386 core is very close to the standard 386 DX, but there are a few visible differences.
Most visibly, the bond pads and pin drivers have been removed from the core.
There are also some circuitry changes. For instance, the 386 SL core supports the <a href="https://websrv.cecs.uci.edu/~papers/mpr/MPR/ARTICLES/060805.PDF">System Management
Mode</a>, which suspends normal execution, allowing power management and other low-level hardware
tasks to be performed outside the regular operating system.
System Management Mode is now a standard part of the x86 line, but it was introduced in the 386 SL.</p>

<p>In total, the 386 SL contains 855,000 transistors,<span id="fnref:quickref"><a href="#fn:quickref">15</a></span> over 3 times as many as the regular 386 DX.
The cache tag RAM takes up a lot of space and transistors.
The cache data itself is external; this on-chip circuitry just manages the cache.
The other new components are largely implemented with standard-cell logic (discussed below); this is visible as uniform stripes
of circuitry, most clearly in the ISA bus controller.</p>
<h2>A brief history of the 386</h2>
<p>From the modern perspective, it seems obvious for Intel to extend the x86 line from the
286 to the 386, while keeping backward compatibility.
But at the time, this path was anything but clear.
This history starts in the late 1970s, when Intel decided to build a "micromainframe" processor, an advanced 32-bit
processor for object-oriented programming that had objects, interprocess communication,
and memory protection implemented in the CPU.
This overly ambitious project fell behind schedule, so Intel created a stopgap processor to
sell until the micromainframe processor was ready.
This stopgap processor was the 16-bit 8086 processor (1978).</p>
<p>In 1981, IBM decided to use the Intel 8088 (an 8086 variant) in the IBM Personal Computer (PC),
but Intel did not realize the importance of this at the time.
Instead, Intel was focused on their
micromainframe processor, also released in 1981 as the iAPX 432, but this became
"one of the great disaster stories of modern computing" as the <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/tech/98/04/biztech/articles/05merced.html">New York Times</a> called it.
Intel then reimplemented the ideas of the
ill-fated iAPX 432 on top of a RISC architecture, creating the more successful <a href="https://www.righto.com/2023/07/the-complex-history-of-intel-i960-risc.html">i960</a>. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, things weren't going well at first for the 286 processor, the follow-on to the 8086<span id="fnref:186"><a href="#fn:186">16</a></span>.
Bill Gates and others called its design "brain-damaged". 
IBM was unenthusiastic about the 286 for their own reasons.<span id="fnref:ibm-286"><a href="#fn:ibm-286">17</a></span>
As a result, the 386 project was a low priority for Intel and the 386 team felt that it was the
"stepchild"; internally, the 386 was pitched as another <a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Oral_History/Intel_386_Business_Strategy/102701962.05.01.pdf#page=14">stopgap</a>, not Intel's "official" 32-bit processor.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of corporate enthusiasm, the 386 team came up with two proposals to
extend the 286 to a 32-bit architecture.
The first was a minimal approach to extend the existing registers and
address space to 32 bits.
The more ambitious proposal would add more registers and create a 32-bit instruction set that
was significantly different from the 8086's 16-bit instruction set.
At the time, the IBM PC was still relatively new, so the importance of the installed
base of software wasn't obvious; software compatibility was viewed as a "nice to have" feature rather than essential.
After much debate, the decision was made around the end of 1982 to go with the minimal proposal,
but supporting both segments and flat addressing, while keeping compatibility with the 286.</p>
<!--
A key design challenge was if it was possible to be compatible with the 8086's segment-based addressing, while
supporting the flat 32-bit address space that would support Unix well.
-->

<p>By 1984, though, the PC industry was booming and the 286 was proving to be a success.
This produced enormous political benefits for the 386 team, who saw the project change from
"stepchild" to "king". <!-- p17 -->
Intel introduced the 386 in 1985, which was otherwise
"a miserable year for Intel and the rest of the semiconductor industry,"
as Intel's <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/doc/report/history-1985-annual-report.pdf">annual report</a> put it.
Due to an industry-wide business slowdown, Intel's net income "essentially disappeared."
Moreover, facing heavy competition from Japan, Intel dropped out of the DRAM business, a crushing blow
for a company that got its start in the memory industry.
Fortunately, the 386 would change everything.</p>
<p>Given IBM's success with the IBM PC, Intel was puzzled that IBM wasn't interested in the 386 processor, but IBM had a strategy of their own.<span id="fnref:ibm"><a href="#fn:ibm">18</a></span>
By this time, the IBM PC was being cloned by many competitors, but IBM had a plan to regain
control of the PC architecture and thus the market: in 1987, IBM introduced the PS/2 line.
These new computers ran the OS/2 operating system instead of Windows and used the proprietary Micro Channel architecture.<span id="fnref:ps2"><a href="#fn:ps2">19</a></span>
IBM used multiple engineering and legal strategies to make cloning the PS/2 slow, expensive, and risky,
so IBM expected they could take back the market from the clones.</p>
<!-- https://doi.org/10.1109/CMPCON.1988.4889 -->

<p>Compaq took the risky approach of ignoring IBM and following their own architectural direction.<span id="fnref:compaq"><a href="#fn:compaq">20</a></span>
Compaq introduced the high-end Deskpro 386 line in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/10/business/company-news-compaq-introduces-more-powerful-pc.html">September 1986</a>, becoming the first major company to build 386-based computers.
An "executive" system, the Deskpro 386 model 40 had a 40-megabyte hard drive and sold for $6449 (over $15,000 in current dollars).
Compaq's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/20/business/the-executive-computer-compaq-s-gamble-on-an-advanced-chip-pays-off.html">gamble paid off</a>
and the Deskpro 386 was a rousing success.</p>

<!-- BYTE Technical implications of PS/2 https://www.ardent-tool.com/docs/scans/BYTE_1987_10_Technical_Implications_of_PS2.pdf -->

<p>As for IBM, the PS/2 line was largely unsuccessful and failed to become the standard.
Rather than
regaining control over the PC,
"IBM lost control of the PC standard in 1987 when it introduced its PS/2 line of systems."<span id="fnref:logic"><a href="#fn:logic">21</a></span>
IBM exited the PC market in <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/ibms-exit-from-pc-business-seen-as-turning-point-20041209-gdka6w.html">2004</a>, selling the business to Lenovo.
One slightly hyperbolic <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZyK7nq">book title</a> summed it up: "Compaq Ended IBM's PC Domination and Helped Invent Modern Computing".
The 386 was a huge moneymaker for Intel, leading to Intel's first billion-dollar quarter in 1990.
It cemented the importance of the x86 architecture, not just for Intel but for the entire
computing industry, dominating the market up to the present day.<span id="fnref:marketshare"><a href="#fn:marketshare">22</a></span></p>
<h2>How the 386 was designed</h2>
<p>The design process of the 386 is interesting because it illustrates Intel's migration
to automated design systems and heavier use of simulation.<span id="fnref:design-and-test"><a href="#fn:design-and-test">23</a></span>
At the time, Intel was behind the industry in its use of tools so the leaders of the 386
realized that more automation would be necessary to build a complex chip like the 386 on schedule.
By making a large investment in automated tools, the 386 team completed the design ahead of schedule.
Along with proprietary CAD tools, the team made heavy use of standard Unix tools such as <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>grep</code>, and <code>make</code> to manage the various design databases.</p>
<p>The 386 posed new design challenges compared to the previous 286 processor.
The 386 was much more complex, with twice the transistors.
But the 386 also used fundamentally different circuitry.
While the 286 and earlier processors were built from NMOS transistors, the 386 moved to
CMOS (the technology still used today). Intel's CMOS process was called CHMOS-III
(complementary high-performance metal-oxide-silicon) and had a feature size of 1.5 µm.
CHMOS-III was based on Intel's HMOS-III process (used for the 286), but extended to
CMOS. Moreover, the CHMOS process provided two layers of metal instead of one, changing
how signals were routed on the chip and requiring new design techniques.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows a cross-section through a CHMOS-III circuit, with an NMOS
transistor on the left and a PMOS transistor on the right.
Note the jagged three-dimensional topography that is formed as layers cross each other
(unlike modern polished wafers).
This resulted in the
"<a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2015/06/102702019-05-01-acc.pdf#page=21">forbidden gap</a>" problem that caused difficulty for the 386 team.
Specifically second-layer metal (M2) could be close to the first-layer metal (M1) or it could be far apart,
but an in-between distance would cause problems: the forbidden gap.
If the metal layer crossed in the "forbidden gap", the metal could crack and whiskers of metal
would touch, causing the chip to fail.
These problems reduced the yield of the 386.</p>

<!-- -->

<p>The design of the 386 proceeded both top-down, starting with the architecture definition,
and bottom-up, designing standard cells and other basic circuits at the transistor level.
The processor's microcode, the software that controlled the chip, was a fundamental component.
It was designed with two CAD tools: an assembler and microcode rule checker.
The high-level design of the chip (register-level RTL)
was created and refined until clock-by-clock and phase-by-phase timing were represented.
The RTL was programmed in <a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/xidak/mainsail_v12/Mainsail_Tutorial_Volume_1_Mar89.pdf">MAINSAIL</a>, a portable Algol-like language based
on SAIL (Stanford Artificial Intelligence Language).
Intel used a proprietary simulator called Microsim to simulate the RTL, stating that
full-chip RTL simulation was "the single most important simulation model of the 80386".</p>
<p>The next step was to convert this high-level design into a detailed logic design, specifying
the gates and other circuitry
using Eden, a proprietary schematics-capture system.
Simulating the logic design required
a dedicated IBM 3083 mainframe that compared it against the
RTL simulations.
Next, the circuit design phase created the transistor-level design.
The chip layout was performed on <a href="https://www.shapr3d.com/history-of-cad/applicon">Applicon</a> and Eden graphics systems.
The layout started with critical blocks such as the ALU and barrel shifter. 
To meet the performance requirements, the TLB (translation lookaside
buffer) for the paging mechanism required a creative design, as did the binary adders.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-versions/standard-cell-colored.jpg"><img alt="Examples of standard cells used in the 386.

From "Automatic Place and Route Used on the 80386" by Joseph Krauskopf and Pat Gelsinger, Intel Technology Journal spring 1986. I have added color.</p>
<p>The "random" (unstructured) logic was implemented with standard cells, rather than the
transistor-by-transistor design of earlier processors.
The idea of standard cells is to have fixed blocks of circuitry (above) for logic gates, flip-flops,
and other basic functions.<span id="fnref:standard-cell-library"><a href="#fn:standard-cell-library">24</a></span>
These cells are arranged in rows by software to implement the specified logic description.
The space between the rows is used as a wiring channel for connections between the cells.
The disadvantage of a standard cell layout is that it generally takes up more space than
an optimized hand-drawn layout, but it is much faster to create and easier to modify.</p>
<p>These standard cells are visible in the die as regular rows of circuitry.
Intel used the <a href="https://ee.sharif.edu/~asic/References/Physical%20Design%20Papers/timberwolf-P2.pdf">TimberWolf</a> automatic placement and routing package, which used simulated annealing to
optimize the placement of cells.
TimberWolf was built by a Berkeley <a href="http://www.aycinena.com/index2/index3/archive/uw%20-%20sechen.html">grad student</a>; one 386 engineer said,
"If management had known that we were using a tool by some grad
student as the key part of the methodology, they would never have let us use it. "
Automated layout was a new thing at Intel; using it improved the schedule, but 
the lower density raised the risk that the chip would be too large.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-versions/standard-cells.jpg"><img alt="Standard cells in the 386. Each row consists of numerous standard cells packed together.

The wide wiring channels between the rows hold the wiring that connects the cells. This block of circuitry is in the bottom center of the chip.</p>
<p>The data path consists of the registers, ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), barrel shifter,
and multiply/divide unit that process the 32-bit data.
Because the data path is critical to the performance of the system,
it was laid out by hand using a CALMA system.
The designers could optimize the layout, taking advantage of regularities in the circuitry,
optimizing the shape and size of each transistor and fitting them together like puzzle pieces.
The data path is visible on the left side of the die, forming orderly 32-bit-wide rectangles
in contrast to the tangles of logic next to it.</p>
<p>Once the transistor-level layout was complete,
Intel's Hierarchical Connectivity Verification System checked that the final layout matched
the schematics and adhered to the process design rules.
The 386 set an Intel speed record, taking just 11 days from completing the layout to "tapeout",
when the chip data is sent on magnetic tape to the mask fabrication company.
(The tapeout team was led by Pat Gelsinger, who later became CEO of Intel.)
After the glass masks were created using
an electron-beam process, Intel's "Fab 3" in Livermore (the first to wear the <a href="https://www.elivermore.com/photos/intel_fab3.htm">bunnysuits</a>) produced the 386 silicon wafers.</p>
<p>Chip designers like to claim that their chip worked the first time, but that was not
the case for the 386.  <!-- p19 -->
When the team received the first silicon for the 386, they ran a trivial do-nothing test
program, "NoOp, NoOp, Halt", and it failed.
Fortunately, they found a small fix to a PLA (Programmable Logic Array). Rather than create new masks, they were able to
patch the existing mask with ion milling and get new wafers quickly. <!-- p20 -->
These wafers worked well enough that they could start the long cycles of debugging and fixing.</p>
<p>Once the processor was released, the problems weren't over.<span id="fnref:bugs"><a href="#fn:bugs">25</a></span>
Some early 386 processors had a <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/comp.arch/c/qm7FVR_YV4A/m/VKR47yLoUdEJ">32-bit multiply problem</a>, where some arguments would
unpredictably produce the wrong results under particular temperature/voltage/frequency conditions.
(This is unrelated to the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_FDIV_bug">Pentium FDIV bug</a> that cost Intel $475 million.)
The root cause was a layout problem, not a logic problem; they didn't allow enough margin to
handle the worst case data in combination with manufacturing process and environment factors.
This tricky problem didn't show up in simulation or chip verification, but was only found in
stress testing.
Intel sold the faulty processors, but marked them as only valid for 16-bit software, while marking the
good processors with a double sigma, as seen below.<span id="fnref:xbts"><a href="#fn:xbts">26</a></span>
This led to embarrassing headlines such as <a href="https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_mDsEAAAAMBAJ/page/n5/mode/1up?view=theater">Some 386 Systems Won't Run 32-Bit Software, Intel Says</a>.
The multiply bug also caused a shortage of 386 chips in
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=u5dYmhF7jc4C&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;pg=PA96#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">1987</a>
and <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Av0xuNrEJakC&amp;lpg=RA6-PT4&amp;pg=RA6-PT4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">1988</a> as Intel redesigned the chip to fix the bug.
Overall, the 386 issues probably weren't any worse than other processors and the problems were soon
forgotten.</p>

<p>The 386 processor was a key turning point for Intel.
Intel's previous processors sold very well, but this was largely due to heavy marketing
("<a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102746836">Operation Crush</a>") and the
good fortune to be selected for the IBM PC.
Intel was technologically behind the competition, especially Motorola.
Motorola had introduced the 68000 processor in 1979, starting a powerful line of
(more-or-less) 32-bit processors.
Intel, on the other hand, lagged with the "brain-damaged" 16-bit 286 processor in 1982.
Intel was also slow with the transition to CMOS; Motorola had moved to CMOS in 1984 with the 68020.</p>
<p>The 386 provided the necessary technological boost for Intel, moving to a 32-bit architecture,
transitioning to CMOS, and fixing the 286's memory model and multitasking limitations, while
maintaining compatibility with the earlier x86 processors.
The overwhelming success of the 386 solidified the dominance of the x86 and Intel, and put
other processor manufacturers on the defensive.
Compaq used the 386 to take over PC architecture leadership from IBM, leading to the success of Compaq, Dell, and other
companies, while IBM eventually departed the PC market entirely.
Thus, the 386 had an oversized effect on the computer industry, shaping the winners and losers for decades.</p>
<!--
Moreover, as a result of the 386, IBM lost control of the IBM PC architecture to Compaq.

 NIH study suggests a small reduction in daily calories is beneficial for wellness.</p><p>Reducing overall calorie intake may rejuvenate your muscles and activate biological pathways important for good health, according to researchers at the National Institutes of Health and their colleagues. Decreasing calories without depriving the body of essential vitamins and minerals, known as calorie restriction, has long been known to delay the progression of age-related diseases in animal models. This new study, published in Aging Cell, suggests the same biological mechanisms may also apply to humans.</p>

<p>Researchers analyzed data from participants in the <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/resource/comprehensive-assessment-long-term-effects-reducing-intake-energy-calerie">Comprehensive Assessment of Long-Term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE)</a>, a study supported by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) that examined whether moderate calorie restriction conveys the same health benefits seen in animal studies. They found that during a two-year span, the goal for participants was to reduce their daily caloric intake by 25%, but the highest the group was able to reach was a 12% reduction. Even so, this slight reduction in calories was enough to activate most of the biological pathways that are important in healthy aging.</p>

<p>"A 12% reduction in calorie intake is very modest," said corresponding author and NIA Scientific Director Luigi Ferrucci, M.D., Ph.D. "This kind of small reduction in calorie intake is doable and may make a big difference in your health."</p>

<p>The research team next sought to understand the molecular underpinnings of the benefits seen in limited, previous research of calorie restriction in humans. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28275127/">One study</a> showed that individuals on calorie restriction lost muscle mass and an average of 20 pounds of weight over the first year and maintained their weight for the second year. However, despite losing muscle mass, calorie restriction participants did not lose muscle strength, indicating calorie restriction improved the amount of force generated by each unit of muscle mass, called muscle specific force.</p>

<p>For the current study, scientists used thigh muscle biopsies from CALERIE participants that were collected when individuals joined the study and at one-year and two-year follow ups.</p>

<p>To figure out which human genes were impacted during calorie restriction, the scientists isolated messenger RNA (mRNA), a molecule that contains the code for proteins, from muscle samples. The team determined the protein sequence of each mRNA and used the information to identify which genes originated specific mRNAs. Further analysis helped the scientists establish which genes during calorie restriction were upregulated, meaning the cells made more mRNA; and which were downregulated, meaning the cells produced less mRNA. The researchers confirmed calorie restriction affected the same gene pathways in humans as in mice and non-human primates. For example, a lower caloric intake upregulated genes responsible for energy generation and metabolism, and downregulated inflammatory genes leading to lower inflammation.</p>

<p>"Since inflammation and aging are strongly coupled, calorie restriction represents a powerful approach to preventing the pro-inflammatory state that is developed by many older people," said Ferrucci.</p>

<p>This research was supported by the NIA Intramural Research Program and the following NIH grants: R01AG061378, P30AG028716, R01AG054840, U01AG060906, R01AG071707, R33AG070455, U01AG020478, U01AG020480, U01AG020487, U01AG022132.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://grumpy.website/1389"><p>Why is nobody excited about these “yesterday”/“2 days ago”/“a week ago” labels?</p><p>Because they pretend to speak human language, but they actually don’t. For a human, yesterday is “at the day before”, “between 0am..11:59pm the day before today”.</p><p>No human uses “less that 24 hours” as the definition of “yesterday”. Computers, unfortunately, do. Add here that different implementations calculate “yesterday” differently (even on the same service) → lack of trust → less useful.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anything longer ago than yesterday should just say the actual date. It’s absurd that I sometimes need to subtract 9 or 12 days, and “borrow” from the previous month, to figure out when something actually happened. (Sometimes it’s in the tooltip or URL slug, but not always.)</p>
<p>I don’t find relative times particularly useful, either, because some sites will reload-in-place to keep them up-to-date, but others won’t. So “1 hour ago” could mean <em>actually</em> one hour ago or it could mean “one hour before I opened that tab.”</p><p><a rel="tag" href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/tag/design/">Design</a> <a rel="tag" href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/tag/time/">Time</a> <a rel="tag" href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/tag/web/">Web</a></p>

You may have to click at the bottom of the email to access the whole thing).</em></p><p><span>A friend of mine, a screenwriter in New York, believes </span><em>Get Back</em><span> has a catalytic effect on anyone who does creative work. Since it aired, he has been getting texts from fellow writers who, having watched it, now have the urge to meet up and work on something, anything, together.</span></p><p>This is strange, in a way, since the series does not present an obviously alluring portrait of creative collaboration. Its principal locations are drab and unglamorous: a vast and featureless film studio, followed by a messy, windowless basement. The catering consists of flaccid toast, mugs of tea, biscuits and cigarettes. The participants, pale and scruffy, seem bored, tired, and unhappy much of the time. None of them seem to know why they are there, what they are working on, or whether they have anything worth working on. As we watch them hack away at the same songs over and over again, we can start to feel a little dispirited too. And yet somewhere on this seemingly aimless journey, an alchemy takes place.</p><div><p><span>Peter Jackson’s decision to make </span><em>Get Back</em><span> an eight-hour series rather than a two hour movie was a risky one. When I heard about it, I wondered if it was the result of a man who, locked down in his Antipodean editing suite, had waded too deep into his material and lost control of it, a Kurtz in the Beatle jungle. But I was wrong:  there is a logic to the </span><em>longeurs</em><span>. That so little happens for long stretches makes the viewer pay closer attention to what </span><em>is</em><span> happening. It forces us to become attuned to the microscopic level at which close relationships unfold; to read the densely compressed messages that can be contained in a look, a smile, an offhand comment.</span></p><p><span>Watching extraordinary people do ordinary things is also just oddly gripping. I loved witnessing the workaday mundanity of The Beatles’ creative life. Turning up for work - for the most part - every day, at an agreed time: </span><em>Morning Paul. Morning George. </em><span>Taking an hour for lunch, popping out for meetings. </span><a href="https://twitter.com/TheyMayBeParted/status/1485476829213380610" rel="">Sticking up your kid’s drawing</a><span> by your workstation. Confessing to hangovers. Discussing TV from the night before. Fart jokes. Happy hour at the end of an afternoon. Coats on: </span><em>Bye then. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow</em><span>.</span></p></div><p>Immersed in all this banality, a funny thing happens to the viewer. As we get into the rhythm of the Beatles’ daily lives, we start to inhabit their world. Since we live through their aimless wandering, we share in the moments of laughter, tenderness and joy that emerge from it with a special intensity. When they get up on that roof at the end of the final episode we feel exhilarated, joyful, and almost as thrilled as they look. I think we learn something along the way, too: that the anomie and the ecstasy are inseparable.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03e15fad-64c7-4531-8af7-9e1d0bed9fa1_1200x675.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03e15fad-64c7-4531-8af7-9e1d0bed9fa1_1200x675.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03e15fad-64c7-4531-8af7-9e1d0bed9fa1_1200x675.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03e15fad-64c7-4531-8af7-9e1d0bed9fa1_1200x675.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03e15fad-64c7-4531-8af7-9e1d0bed9fa1_1200x675.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03e15fad-64c7-4531-8af7-9e1d0bed9fa1_1200x675.jpeg" width="1200" height="675" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/03e15fad-64c7-4531-8af7-9e1d0bed9fa1_1200x675.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:675,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;The Beatles rehearse I&amp;#39;ve Got A Feeling in first clip from Get Back  documentary | Guitar World&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="The Beatles rehearse I&amp;#39;ve Got A Feeling in first clip from Get Back  documentary | Guitar World" title="The Beatles rehearse I&amp;#39;ve Got A Feeling in first clip from Get Back  documentary | Guitar World" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03e15fad-64c7-4531-8af7-9e1d0bed9fa1_1200x675.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03e15fad-64c7-4531-8af7-9e1d0bed9fa1_1200x675.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03e15fad-64c7-4531-8af7-9e1d0bed9fa1_1200x675.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03e15fad-64c7-4531-8af7-9e1d0bed9fa1_1200x675.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Let’s remind ourselves about how unwise, or if you prefer, insane, the Twickenham project was. The Beatles had only just finished a double album, the </span><em>White Album</em><span> (that was its nickname - I love hearing the Beatles call it “The Beatles”). It was a huge project and they had plenty of arguments in the making of it. Fortunately, it sold boatloads - their most commercially successful album to date. Paul and John have new girlfriends they’re very serious about. George is with Patti and hanging out with Dylan, Ringo has two young kids. In other words, they had every excuse, and every reason, to take six months or a year off. But no. In September, they enjoy making a promo for </span><em>Hey Jude</em><span> in front of a live audience, which rekindles their interest in performing, and they come up with a vague plan to do a TV special in the new year.</span></p><p><span>The initial idea was to perform songs from the </span><em>White Album</em><span>. That makes sense: using a show to perform songs from the album they just made is what ANY NORMAL BAND WOULD DO. But no. John and Paul get together before Christmas and decide they have to create a whole album’s worth of </span><em>new</em><span> songs, learn to play those while being filmed, and then perform them. That would be hard enough to achieve in three to six months. But because Ringo has to make a film they end up trying to cram all of this - writing, learning, rehearsing, show-planning - into</span><em> three weeks. </em><span>And they choose to do it all in an aircraft hangar.</span></p><p><span>The Beatles’ allergy to repetition, their relentless instinct to seek out the new rather than repackage the old, is here taken to such an extreme that it puts them in an absurd position. As a group, they were terrible at making non-musical decisions. They were much better at saying what they didn’t want to do than at making sensible plans for what they did want to do. So they ended up in this trap. As we watch the four Beatles try to escape from it, we are moved, because we see, for the first time, quite what a fragile creative entity they always were, and how hard they worked to stay together.</span></p><p><span>Nearly every Beatles album was perfect or close to it, a succession of immaculate conceptions. The Beach Boys, perhaps their closest artistic rivals, made some jewels, some stinkers, and some just-OK albums. That was typical, even for the best artists. There was something mysterious and implacable about The Beatles’ ability to keep a high standard at a high volume of output. It baffled their peers. Brian Wilson </span><a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hPh3BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1757&amp;lpg=PA1757&amp;dq=brian+wilson+the+beatles+always+landed+on+their+feet&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JLdofr05LU&amp;sig=ACfU3U0e4r1OtsOIn2MXi9Wbeavf0LY_yg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiGoNLO25v1AhXpSfEDHQ6SAjsQ6AF6BAghEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=brian%20wilson%20the%20beatles%20always%20landed%20on%20their%20feet&amp;f=false" rel="">said</a><span> of them, “They never did anything clumsy. It was like perfect pitch but for entire songs…everything landed on its feet.” Lou Reed, not noted for gushing praise of fellow artists, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/realtedcogs/status/1485345209932128257" rel="">said</a><span>, “They just made the songs up, bing bing bing. They have to be the most incredible songwriters ever - just amazingly talented.”</span></p><p><em>Let It Be</em><span>, the album that eventually emerged from the </span><em>Get Back</em><span> sessions, and the last new Beatles album to be released, has always been the closest thing to a glitch in this long run of jewels. Unfinished by the group, it is messy, uneven and incoherent by their standards, even though it contains a few songs that would be enough to turn most bands into legends by themselves. Today, </span><em>Let It Be</em><span> exists in various iterations, none of them definitive. One effect of Jackson’s </span><em>Get Back</em><span> is to find, or restore, a purpose to this loose strand from The Beatles’ recording career, by letting us in on a secret: they didn’t know what they were doing.</span><br></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F044b6753-25dc-48e0-a9ce-834dcbcb0716_1591x1128.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F044b6753-25dc-48e0-a9ce-834dcbcb0716_1591x1128.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F044b6753-25dc-48e0-a9ce-834dcbcb0716_1591x1128.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F044b6753-25dc-48e0-a9ce-834dcbcb0716_1591x1128.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F044b6753-25dc-48e0-a9ce-834dcbcb0716_1591x1128.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F044b6753-25dc-48e0-a9ce-834dcbcb0716_1591x1128.jpeg" width="1456" height="1032" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/044b6753-25dc-48e0-a9ce-834dcbcb0716_1591x1128.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1032,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;19 May 1967: Press launch for Sgt Pepper&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="19 May 1967: Press launch for Sgt Pepper" title="19 May 1967: Press launch for Sgt Pepper" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F044b6753-25dc-48e0-a9ce-834dcbcb0716_1591x1128.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F044b6753-25dc-48e0-a9ce-834dcbcb0716_1591x1128.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F044b6753-25dc-48e0-a9ce-834dcbcb0716_1591x1128.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F044b6753-25dc-48e0-a9ce-834dcbcb0716_1591x1128.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><br><span>At one point in </span><em>Get Back</em><span>, during the endless discussion about why they’re all here, George Harrison reminds the others that The Beatles have never really made plans: “The things that have worked out best for us haven’t&nbsp;</span><em>really</em><span>&nbsp;been planned any more than this has. It’s just… like, you go into something and it does it by itself. Whatever it’s gonna be, it&nbsp;</span><em>becomes</em><span>&nbsp;that.” I think this represents a profound truth about The Beatles. They moved through the world in a dream, and the world </span><em>became</em><span> their dream. They were famous in Britain and then America and then everywhere; they made albums with sitars and tape loops and kids’ songs on them; they dressed up in sherbet-coloured military tunics and gave themselves a different name; they made a wild sprawling double album with nothing on the cover. And everything worked.</span></p><p>In a dream, you decide to fly and you fly and it doesn’t even seem odd that you can fly. When I say the Beatles didn’t know what they were doing, that’s what I mean. The Beatles certainly knew what they were doing in the sense that they were incredible musicians and intelligent individuals. But they didn’t understand the secret of their other-worldly achievements any more than Brian Wilson or Lou Reed did - any more than we do now. They didn’t want to know, and they didn’t need to. It does it by itself.</p><p><span>Whether you prefer to call it genius or providence (Rick Rubin says The Beatles are the single best argument for the existence of God), the dream lasted for the best part of a decade. In </span><em>Get Back</em><span> we meet the group in the midst of waking up from it, the spell wearing off. When they throw a pack of cards in the air, they can no longer rely on a castle magically assembling itself. It turns out they can’t set up a record label and wait for the money to roll in, and it’s looking very much like they can’t make a TV spectacular from scratch in a few weeks. It also turns out that there’s more than two songwriters in the band and more than four people in the friendship group.</span></p><p><span>What makes </span><em>Get Back</em><span> so dramatic, in its undramatic way, is seeing the Beatles struggle to adjust to waking life. The struggle unfolds in the music they’re making and in how they negotiate their changing relationships to each other. This was a group comprised of talented, wilful individuals who shared a powerful resistance to being told what to do. The question should not be why they split up so much as how they stayed together. The answer is that they loved each other, they shared an appetite for work, and they knew they were special as a group. But it was nonetheless hard and getting harder. In </span><em>Get Back</em><span>, the mythical, world-conquering, four-headed beast is revealed to be four young men, beset by uncertainty, wondering if they really want to be tied together like this forever. </span></p><p><span>They’re also wondering if they’re still any good. Even if they had more right than anyone else on the planet to believe in their own creative infallibility, they clearly do not. George Harrison, in particular, is keen to tell his bandmates that other artists are making music as good or better than anything they have in the locker, and what they’re doing right now is corny and would be thrown out of Apple if it was by another band. Lennon and McCartney do not seem in the mood to argue. Before a take of (the song) </span><em>Get Back</em><span>, George Martin asks from the control room, ‘What are you calling this, Paul?”. McCartney replies, “Shit. Shit, take one.” They may have genius on their side, but right now it doesn’t feel like it.</span><br></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63863d7f-90a5-499d-835f-f571d59dc8b0_651x450.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63863d7f-90a5-499d-835f-f571d59dc8b0_651x450.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63863d7f-90a5-499d-835f-f571d59dc8b0_651x450.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63863d7f-90a5-499d-835f-f571d59dc8b0_651x450.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63863d7f-90a5-499d-835f-f571d59dc8b0_651x450.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63863d7f-90a5-499d-835f-f571d59dc8b0_651x450.webp" width="511" height="353.2258064516129" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/63863d7f-90a5-499d-835f-f571d59dc8b0_651x450.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:450,&quot;width&quot;:651,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:511,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Watch Paul McCartney Write Get Back in Peter Jackson&amp;#39;s Get Back (Video)&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Watch Paul McCartney Write Get Back in Peter Jackson&amp;#39;s Get Back (Video)" title="Watch Paul McCartney Write Get Back in Peter Jackson&amp;#39;s Get Back (Video)" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63863d7f-90a5-499d-835f-f571d59dc8b0_651x450.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63863d7f-90a5-499d-835f-f571d59dc8b0_651x450.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63863d7f-90a5-499d-835f-f571d59dc8b0_651x450.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63863d7f-90a5-499d-835f-f571d59dc8b0_651x450.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>The nucleus of the Beatle atom was comprised of John and Paul, who shared a mental channel along which music, emotion, ideas and jokes travelled at the speed of light. As the dream faded, so did the efficiency of the connection (or vice versa). By 1969, Lennon and McCartney can’t hear each other as well as they used to. They are like kids who have been listening avidly to Radio Luxembourg all night and now find the signal drowning amidst waves of static. The place they can still commune with each other is in the studio, which is why the </span><em>Get Back</em><span> sessions, and the songs, centre on their relationship. We get to see what George can see: that for all their difficulties these two are still locked into each other, emotionally and musically. At Twickenham, they sit face-to-face and harmonise on a song called </span><em>Two of Us,</em><span> while George glowers at them. At one point, McCartney stops and notes that his songs are telling a bigger story. </span><em>I’ve Got a Feeling, Two of Us, Get Back</em><span>… John says it out loud: “It’s like me and you are lovers”. McCartney, suddenly inarticulate, grunts assent, and they both flick their hair.</span></p><div><p><span>We see quite how much the Lennon-McCartney partnership was the central power bloc of the band, and how dominant they still were. In the wake of Harrison’s exit, George Martin notes that John and Paul, for all that they haven’t been getting on as well as they did, are “still a team”. This was rooted in economics as well their personal relationship: when one of George’s songs is up next, John asks, “Is this Harrisongs?” (Harrisongs was George’s publishing company). The basic dynamic of the group has not changed much since Paul recommended George to John as a worthy addition to The Quarry Men, and John and Paul decided they were the songwriters.</span></p><p><span>One way to read the story of </span><em>Get Back</em><span> is Paul trying to spark John into life, whether by confronting him over missing songs, or, more subtly, and more touchingly, playing </span><em>Strawberry Fields</em><span> at the piano while John sits with his back to him, fiddling on the guitar, pretending not to listen. </span><em>See, John - this is how you good you are.</em></p></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11589cf6-8de7-4310-a0fb-d5227a145d29_1800x1286.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11589cf6-8de7-4310-a0fb-d5227a145d29_1800x1286.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11589cf6-8de7-4310-a0fb-d5227a145d29_1800x1286.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11589cf6-8de7-4310-a0fb-d5227a145d29_1800x1286.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11589cf6-8de7-4310-a0fb-d5227a145d29_1800x1286.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11589cf6-8de7-4310-a0fb-d5227a145d29_1800x1286.jpeg" width="572" height="408.57142857142856" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/11589cf6-8de7-4310-a0fb-d5227a145d29_1800x1286.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1040,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:572,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;The Beatles: Get Back&amp;#39; Documentary—An Exclusive Look at Peter Jackson&amp;#39;s  Revelatory New Movie | Vanity Fair&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="The Beatles: Get Back&amp;#39; Documentary—An Exclusive Look at Peter Jackson&amp;#39;s  Revelatory New Movie | Vanity Fair" title="The Beatles: Get Back&amp;#39; Documentary—An Exclusive Look at Peter Jackson&amp;#39;s  Revelatory New Movie | Vanity Fair" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11589cf6-8de7-4310-a0fb-d5227a145d29_1800x1286.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11589cf6-8de7-4310-a0fb-d5227a145d29_1800x1286.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11589cf6-8de7-4310-a0fb-d5227a145d29_1800x1286.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11589cf6-8de7-4310-a0fb-d5227a145d29_1800x1286.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>McCartney takes centre-stage in </span><em>Get Back</em><span>, its most vividly human, full-spectrum personality. Even to those of us who thought we ‘knew’ him pretty well, he comes alive in a new way. We see him glum, slumped in chairs, staring off into the middle distance, biting his nails, or even, in the scene where he considers that this might be the end, sucking his thumb, as his eyes pool with tears (“And then there were two”). We see a toothy, boyish, involuntary grin, different to his practiced public smile, which lights up his face when John makes a joke or Billy Preston plays a ravishing lick on the keyboard. The grin makes several appearances on the rooftop, including right after he sees the police arrive.</span></p><p><span>We get glimpses of how overbearing and annoying he could be. He doesn’t shout or bully but he is so clear, at least in his mind, about what he wants from a song that he can leave little room for the others to feel like they are anything but session musicians. We see him react to whatever George says with minimal interest, and pay scant attention to George’s songs. At the same time, he is self-aware enough to know he is annoying people, and emotionally intelligent enough to diagnose the underlying problem: that the group needs a decision-maker but resists anyone who tries to take the role. Paul’s creative vitality makes him the navigator but the others aren’t keen on him driving the car.</span></p><p><span> In the flowerpot conversation, we hear Paul reassuring John that he’s the boss, has always been the boss, John demurring. Paul has power without legitimacy; John has legitimacy but no longer wants power.</span></p><p><span>McCartney lays out the central problem faced by the group with such startling lucidity that it feels at times as if we’re watching a scripted biopic. In a discussion of how difficult they have found it to make decisions since the death of “Mr Epstein”, he says, “Daddy’s gone away now, and we’re on our own at the holiday camp.” McCartney puts more effort than anyone else into understanding where others are coming from. He tries to understand John and Yoko, and to “explain” them to the others as sympathetically as possible. We see him playing with Linda’s daughter Heather, with whom he has evidently struck up a loving bond within months of meeting her. Some of the most beautiful moments of the series are of them playing together: her combing his hair, him throwing her in the air,  her clamped to him like a limpet, while he plays the piano.</span></p><p><span>We see how open Paul is to those around him, inviting suggestions for lyrics from Mal Evans, accepting Glyn John’s musical direction on </span><em>Let It Be</em><span>. He teaches a young clapboard operator about songwriting at the piano (“Unless you stop yourself, there’s no stopping yourself” - a great line). We see how funny he was, particularly in the presence of John. I love his cockney gangster voice (after George gets a shock from his mic - “IF THIS BOY DIES YOU’RE GONNA COP IT”). Then there’s his only-a-northern-bloke voice, which he uses to say thanks to Billy Preston: “Coming from the north of England, it doesn’t come so easy, the soul.” We see how much he relishes his physicality, scaling the gantry, climbing the chain, leaping up to the rooftop for a recce. And how good does he look? Blackly Irish hair, thick beard, soulful eyes, slender figure in well-cut clothes. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2be0754f-eaca-483c-af6d-a443a4aef61b_1400x788.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2be0754f-eaca-483c-af6d-a443a4aef61b_1400x788.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2be0754f-eaca-483c-af6d-a443a4aef61b_1400x788.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2be0754f-eaca-483c-af6d-a443a4aef61b_1400x788.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2be0754f-eaca-483c-af6d-a443a4aef61b_1400x788.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2be0754f-eaca-483c-af6d-a443a4aef61b_1400x788.jpeg" width="566" height="318.57714285714286" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2be0754f-eaca-483c-af6d-a443a4aef61b_1400x788.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:788,&quot;width&quot;:1400,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:566,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Peter Jackson&amp;#39;s Beatles documentary Get Back gets a first look trailer -  Polygon&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Peter Jackson&amp;#39;s Beatles documentary Get Back gets a first look trailer -  Polygon" title="Peter Jackson&amp;#39;s Beatles documentary Get Back gets a first look trailer -  Polygon" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2be0754f-eaca-483c-af6d-a443a4aef61b_1400x788.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2be0754f-eaca-483c-af6d-a443a4aef61b_1400x788.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2be0754f-eaca-483c-af6d-a443a4aef61b_1400x788.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2be0754f-eaca-483c-af6d-a443a4aef61b_1400x788.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>If Paul takes the leading role in </span><em>Get Back</em><span> it’s worth bearing in mind that this is a snapshot of the group, and that if a similar documentary had been made in, say, 1965, it would probably have been Lennon who captivated us the most. When </span><a href="https://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/john-was-the-boss-beatle-billy-preston.461387/" rel="">Billy Preston was interviewed</a><span> in the 1970s, he said that to him Lennon was clearly “the boss” of The Beatles. That’s slightly surprising until you remember that Preston got to know the band in 1962, when he was part of Little Richard’s touring band. That was his anchor point, and at that time Lennon would have been the band’s dominant personality. By 1969, Lennon had receded, although even in recession he is somehow still the group’s pivotal figure, the one they all wanted to please, the puzzle they most wanted to solve. (Note that after George walks out, all the conversations are about John.)</span></p><p><span>When we meet Lennon in </span><em>Get Back,</em><span> he is in a fallow period, which has a dampening effect on his all-round confidence. Although, hang on a minute: can we really say a man is in a creative trough if, just a matter of months ago, he made </span><em>Dear Prudence</em><span>, </span><em>Julia</em><span>, </span><em>Happiness Is a Warm Gun</em><span>? When he is in the midst of creating </span><em>Don’t Let Me Down</em><span>? Perhaps it depends on who he’s sitting next to. In January 1969, Lennon seems like he’s drying up, and to an extent </span><em>is</em><span> drying up, because his primary creative partner is on a hot streak of epic proportion. McCartney apparently only has to sit at the piano, pick up a guitar or just allow his mind to wander, for songs to come surging through him. Months after </span><em>Blackbird</em><span> and </span><em>Hey Jude</em><span>, we now get </span><em>Let It Be</em><span>, </span><em>Long and Winding Road</em><span>, </span><em>Get Back</em><span>, </span><em>Golden Slumbers</em><span>, </span><em>Two of Us, Oh! Darling, </em><span>and more</span><em>. </em><span>Perhaps the question is not why Lennon is in a creative slump, but why McCartney isn’t. </span></p><p><span>Towards the end of the 1960s Bob Dylan and The Beach Boys were in states of disarray, creative outputs stuttering, minds and bodies giving out. Meanwhile, The Beatles increased their rate of production, making a double album in 1968 and </span><em>two</em><span> albums in 1969 (about three weeks after the end of these sessions they were back in the studio for what became </span><em>Abbey Road)</em><span>. The engine of the band throughout this period was the relentlessly fecund McCartney. We ought to sympathise with Lennon. Yes, we can blame his drug-taking, but imagine being in his position: a tired genius whose closest collaborator is hurling down thunderbolt after thunderbolt from the top of a mountain, pausing only to ask,</span><em> so what have you got?</em></p><p><span>Lennon may not be at his most dynamic in </span><em>Get Back</em><span> but he’s still compelling, partly because he’s not the character we expected to meet. At least, he’s not who I expected. Having ingested many books about the Beatles I thought he was going to be fiery, caustic, domineering, and - in this period - bitterly scornful of McCartney. Yet the Lennon we see here is for the most part a rather gentle presence who acts as a calming mediator between Paul and George. He grins at Paul, laughs heartily at his jokes, listens patiently to him. There is something quite childlike about John, particularly when his face opens up into a smile as the band hits a groove, or when he’s sitting patiently on the floor with a guitar and Yoko, waiting for another take. When Ringo starts playing </span><em>Octopus’s Garden</em><span> with George, John says “What am I doing, Ritchie?” and gets on the drums. There is bravado, of course - as when, following George’s departure, he immediately suggests they get Clapton in and split George’s guitars. But there is tenderness, too: after George leaves, it is John who brings the three remaining Beatles together into a hug. </span></p><div><p><span>We are used to thinking of Lennon as the visionary and Paul as the pragmatist. Yet here it’s Paul who throws up wildly impractical ideas - a news show that ends in an announcement of The Beatles’ split, a TV spectacular, an album full of songs they haven’t written yet, by next week - and John who suggests, mildly and sympathetically, that they consider what’s actually possible. (I was struck by how McCartney’s vision of The Beatles encompassed so much more than music; he was always thinking about film and TV, image and story. He wasn’t satisfied just with making another album - “a very non-visual thing”.)</span></p><p><span>Even though John is under-powered in this period we still see what made him so magnetic to Paul and to others around him. There is a scene early in Part Two that I find riveting. It takes place a couple of days after George has left. The status of everything - the project, the band - remains uncertain, but they are ploughing on for now. John, Yoko, Ringo, Paul and some of the crew are sitting in a semi-circle. Paul looks pensive. Ringo looks tired. John is speaking only in deadpan comic riffs, to which Paul responds now and again. Peter Sellers comes in and sits down, looks ill-at-ease, and leaves having barely said a word, unable to penetrate the Beatle bubble</span></p></div><p><span>. At some point they’re joined by Lindsay-Hogg, and the conversation dribbles on. John mentions that he had to leave an interview that morning in order to throw up (he and Yoko had taken heroin the night before).</span></p><p><span> Paul, looking into space rather than addressing anyone in particular, attempts to turn the conversation towards what they’re meant to be doing:</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Paul</strong><span>:</span><em> </em><span>See, what we need is a serious program of work. Not an endless rambling among the canyons of your mind.</span></p><p><strong>John</strong><span>:</span><em> </em><span>Take me on that trip upon that golden ship of shores… We’re all together, boy.</span></p><p><strong>Paul:</strong><span> To wander aimlessly is very unswinging. Unhip.</span></p><p><strong>John: </strong><span>And when I touch you, I feel happy inside. I can’t hide, I can’t hide. [pause] Ask me why, I’ll say I love you.</span></p><p><strong>Paul: </strong><span>What we need is a </span><em>schedule</em><span>.</span></p><p><strong>John: </strong><span>A garden schedule.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>I mean first of all, </span><em>who is writing this incredible dialogue</em><span>? Samuel Beckett? </span></p><p><span>Let’s break it down a little. The first thing to note is that John and Paul are talking to each other without talking to each other. This is partly because they’re aware of the cameras and also because they’re just not sure how to communicate with each other at the moment. John’s contributions are oblique, gnomic, riddling, comprised only of songs and jokes, like the Fool in King Lear. </span><em>Take me on that trip upon that golden ship of shores </em><span>sounds like a Lennonised version of a line from Dylan’s </span><em>Tambourine Man</em><span> (“take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship”). “We’re altogether, boy”? I have no idea. Does Paul? I think John expects Paul to understand him because he has such faith in what they used to call their “heightened awareness”, a dreamlike, automatic connection to each other’s minds. But right now, Paul is not much in the mood for it. His speech is more direct, though he too adopts a quasi-poetic mode (“canyons of your mind” is borrowed from a song by the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hcZ4s9cvpw" rel="">Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band)</a><span> and he can’t bring himself to make eye contact. “To wander aimlessly is very unswinging,” he says (another great line, I will pin it above my writing desk). Then John does something amazing: he starts talking in Beatle, dropping in lyrics from the early years of the band, </span><em>I Want To Hold Your Hand</em><span> and </span><em>Ask Me Why</em><span>. (To appreciate John’s response to Paul’s mention of a schedule, American readers may need reminding that English people pronounce it “shed - dule”.)</span></p><p><span>What’s going on throughout this exchange? Maybe Lennon is just filling dead air, or playing to the gallery, but I think he is (also) attempting to communicate to Paul in their shared code - something like he loves him, he loves The Beatles, they’re still in this together. Of course, we can’t know. </span><em>I can’t hide, </em><span>John says</span><em>,</em><span> hiding behind his wordplay.</span></p><p> After this, Paul suggests, as if quoting from a self-help book, that they aim to “achieve something every day”. Yoko and John dissent (“That’s hard”). Then Lindsay-Hogg complains that his film is grinding to a halt. “Grinding to a halt?” says John, “I think it’s taking off.” At this, the mood shifts. Everyone, including Paul, starts laughing. A phone rings. John picks up a film reel case, pretends to answer it, embarks on a glorious riff which culminates in a joke about scouts and masturbation which leaves Paul, so morose just a minute ago, helpless with giggles. </p><p><span>You can see in this scene, and throughout the film, why John was forgiven for so much: he was just so bloody </span><em>funny</em><span>. His gift for comedy was not far short of his gift for music. He uses jokes to obstruct, obfuscate and deflect, and yet the undeniable truth is that he is a genuinely brilliant, lightning-quick, Peter Cook-level improviser. Paul has been laughing at John’s jokes since they spent every spare hour together in their parents’ homes. It’s hard to stay stern or angry when you’re laughing.</span></p><p><span>Adjacent to this is John’s knack for spontaneous, nonsense poetry. On the </span><em>Let It Be</em><span> album there is a fragmentary track called </span><em>Dig It</em><span>, in which Lennon incants incongruous names over a Preston-infused groove:</span></p><p><em><span>Like the FBI</span><br><span>And the CIA</span><br><span>And the BBC</span><br><span>B.B. King</span><br><span>And Doris Day</span><br><span>Matt Busby</span></em><span>We can now see this was taken from a tape of one of the furious jams they played at Apple. I’d always thought of the words as lyrics, but they are part of a stream of improvisation which might have been stepped into at different places. This kind of thing is much harder to do than you might think. Lennon, at least when he was in the mood, was a master of it. His linguistic jamming made its way into lyrics, most unforgettably on </span><em>I Am The Walrus</em><span>. Written down on the page, it pales somewhat (his poetry books are thin stuff). It is Lennon’s delivery, his voice, his physical self, that make his wordplay such a thrill. He was more of a comedian than a poet - one who, like Cook, did his best work in private, without a script. </span><br></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c2b8f2-42b9-4209-a507-a019b4fca865_1636x920.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c2b8f2-42b9-4209-a507-a019b4fca865_1636x920.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c2b8f2-42b9-4209-a507-a019b4fca865_1636x920.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c2b8f2-42b9-4209-a507-a019b4fca865_1636x920.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c2b8f2-42b9-4209-a507-a019b4fca865_1636x920.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c2b8f2-42b9-4209-a507-a019b4fca865_1636x920.jpeg" width="640" height="360" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/03c2b8f2-42b9-4209-a507-a019b4fca865_1636x920.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:640,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Teaser trailer for the Beatles: Get Back shows unseen video | News | The  Times&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Teaser trailer for the Beatles: Get Back shows unseen video | News | The  Times" title="Teaser trailer for the Beatles: Get Back shows unseen video | News | The  Times" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c2b8f2-42b9-4209-a507-a019b4fca865_1636x920.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c2b8f2-42b9-4209-a507-a019b4fca865_1636x920.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c2b8f2-42b9-4209-a507-a019b4fca865_1636x920.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c2b8f2-42b9-4209-a507-a019b4fca865_1636x920.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><br><span>There is a charming moment when Paul is leafing through the catalogue of songs Dick James has purchased on their behalf, and comes across </span><em>Carolina Moon</em><span>. </span><em>“</em><span>That’s one of my uncle’s favourites!</span><em>” </em><span>he says, slipping into an impression of Uncle Ron at a New Year’s party, slurring his words: “</span><em>Carolina Moon!</em><span> C’mon Paul, join in!” You can almost </span><em>see</em><span> little Paul by the piano with his Dad, surrounded by beery uncles and merry aunts as they launch into another song. To know a little about the Beatles’ childhoods from reading is one thing; it’s quite another to see the children come to life in the men. By 1969, they were worldly and somewhat weary rock stars but they were also chums who met at school and knew each other’s parents. When George suggests covering a wall at Apple with gold discs, John replies, tartly, “You’ll have to get them off Mimi’s wall.” When George leaves the group, where does he go? Liverpool, presumably to see his mum. There’s a moment at Apple when they are tuning up their instruments, and they start playing, and Glyn Johns interrupts to say the bass is out of tune. John and George </span><em>hoot</em><span> with glee because it’s Paul, the swot, who is at fault. He takes it well.</span></p><p><span>As for Ringo, what impresses us about him in </span><em>Get Back</em><span> is his stoicism,  his ability to wait in silence without loss of motivation (he is the most Eastern, the most Zen, of all the Beatles). When the others stop talking and start playing, Ringo is always ready, responding alertly to their shifting needs. His rare contributions to group discussions are pivotal (“I would like to go on the roof”) and perceptive (“It’s the autobiography of The Beatles, isn’t it?”). Observing Ringo’s talent for watchfulness, I thought about his childhood, too: the endless hours </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beatles/comments/a1a4bb/ringo_starr_was_so_ill_as_a_child_doctors_told/" rel="">he spent on a sickbed</a><span> with nobody to talk to and nothing to do. His long apprenticeship in patience.</span></p><p><span>One of the pleasures of </span><em>Get Back</em><span> is watching the Beatles throw themselves into songs they learnt in Liverpool and Hamburg and seeing how much those songs are in their bones. They had instant, muscle memory access to a vast library of rock n’ roll and country and pop. Then there are </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CphFn26l77Y" rel="">the Lennon-McCartney Originals</a><span>: songs the two of them discarded but still know back to front; songs written at Mendips or Forthlin Road, some of which are irresistible even in half-cocked form. They aren’t just rock n’ roll, either - </span><em>Half a Pound of Greasepaint</em><span> sounds like a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfmAeijj5cM" rel="">George Formby</a><span> deep cut. John and Paul’s singing can lift any song out of the ordinary, give it flight. When they hit those harmonies, and that inimitable blend of voices rings out, I don’t really mind what the song is.</span></p><p><span>The Beatles don’t spend much time reminiscing about stadium gigs in America or Japan, or doing the Ed Sullivan show, or meeting the Queen or Muhammed Ali. When they talk about the past, it is mostly about the years when they were struggling to make it. Hamburg in particular seems vividly present to them. They joke about “</span><em>MAK SHOW</em><span>” which their first German boss used to shout at them on stage until they learned how to do just that. John breaks into pidgin German. One reason they trust Billy Preston immediately is that they hung out with him in Hamburg (they sweetly serenade him with the song he used to request, </span><em>A Taste of Honey</em><span>). At Apple, Paul suggests to George Martin they need a sound system like the one they had at the Star Club. Martin rather briskly cuts him off, implying, without quite saying, that this is London in 1969, not Hamburg in 1962, and you’re the biggest group in the world now; you can probably do a bit better than that.</span></p><p><span>If they so often return to Hamburg in their minds it’s because that is where John, Paul and George became, not just a band who called themselves The Beatles, but </span><em>The Beatles</em><span> - if only to themselves, at first. Abroad for the first time, far from families and rivals, in a place where they didn’t speak the language, they founded a sovereign country of their own, with its own norms, traditions, and politics. Being themselves and staying themselves was a founding principle (when Paul talks to John about India in </span><em>Get Back</em><span> this is what he pinpoints as his regret - that for once they had allowed an outsider to shape their personalities). But the principle of always moving on was foundational, too, and that entailed moving apart eventually; the Beatles were too adventurous to stay in their own magic kingdom forever. The </span><em>Get Back</em><span> project shows them looking both ways at once, longing to be a tight little band of brothers, yearning to leave the motherland.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40388cb8-e14d-4954-b759-a3a1240e5f24_1920x1036.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40388cb8-e14d-4954-b759-a3a1240e5f24_1920x1036.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40388cb8-e14d-4954-b759-a3a1240e5f24_1920x1036.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40388cb8-e14d-4954-b759-a3a1240e5f24_1920x1036.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40388cb8-e14d-4954-b759-a3a1240e5f24_1920x1036.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40388cb8-e14d-4954-b759-a3a1240e5f24_1920x1036.jpeg" width="1456" height="786" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/40388cb8-e14d-4954-b759-a3a1240e5f24_1920x1036.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:786,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;George Martin – Twickenham Film Studios, 8 January 1969 - The Beatles Bible&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="George Martin – Twickenham Film Studios, 8 January 1969 - The Beatles Bible" title="George Martin – Twickenham Film Studios, 8 January 1969 - The Beatles Bible" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40388cb8-e14d-4954-b759-a3a1240e5f24_1920x1036.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40388cb8-e14d-4954-b759-a3a1240e5f24_1920x1036.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40388cb8-e14d-4954-b759-a3a1240e5f24_1920x1036.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40388cb8-e14d-4954-b759-a3a1240e5f24_1920x1036.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><br><span>When you read a lot about The Beatles you’re amazed at their talents and also at the wave of flukes they rode along the way. A lot of things had to fall into place for them to succeed. In particular, they had a knack of finding, or being found by, the right collaborators at the right time. If it hadn’t been for “Mr Epstein” happening upon them in 1961 they may well have given up before they got going. There was Ringo, of course, the perfect drummer, and the perfect personality, for the three founders. And if they hadn’t been sent to George Martin they probably wouldn’t have been signed, and certainly wouldn’t have reached the musical heights they did. </span></p><div><p><span>In </span><em>Get Back</em><span>, Martin is not the central character that he would have been in a documentary about any album up until </span><em>Sergeant Pepper</em><span>. He has been deliberately marginalised by the band so that they can make a different kind of record to the ones they made with him. Precisely because of that, we get to see what an exceptionally decent man he was; more concerned with seeing The Beatles flourish than in being the one who made them flourish. His official role is as EMI’s representative, there to ensure the band deliver some kind of material to the label, but he has no fixed role otherwise. If Martin had been more egotistical - that is, if he had a normal-sized ego - he would have been either sulking or desperately trying to impose himself on proceedings. He does neither. He is content to offer help when needed, while looking supremely suave. </span></p><p><span>Martin’s protegé Glyn Johns has become the band’s main producer for this project and is doing a very good job. You might expect Martin to be a little miffed by this. But we hear him insisting that Johns should be the one to finish the record. Throughout he is cheerful. When George and Ringo play through </span><em>Octopus’s Garden</em><span> at the piano he sings an accompanying line, but on the whole he restricts himself to technical matters. When the band moves back to Apple and it turns out that the studio built by Magic Alex is as much use as one of his reversible bass guitars, it is Martin who, Jeeves-like, clears up the mess and makes it work. He puts paper into the piano so that it sounds “less like a Blüthner”, for George’s honky-tonk </span><em>For You Blue</em><span>. Once the band’s orchestrator, he is now its plumber.</span></p><p><span>He accepts this role because he loves his boys. You can see how much pleasure he takes in their company, how much he wants them to succeed at whatever they’re doing, and how much he wants them to be happy - as happy as they were when they first tumbled in to see him at Abbey Road. Martin is acutely alert to the tensions between them, particularly between John and Paul. He sees better than any other outsider that they are finding it hard to rediscover their old ease with each other. That brings a certain poignancy to his interactions with them. During a discussion over how to improve the acoustics of the Apple studio, Martin says, “Don’t worry boys, I’ll get you back to where you were yesterday. I’ll fix you, I’ll fix you.”</span></p><p><span>After watching </span><em>Get Back</em><span> we can add two more to this list of benevolent outsiders who turn up, miraculously, at the right time. </span><a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/arts-entertainment/billy-preston-fifth-beatle/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=sharebutton" rel="">Billy Preston</a><span> drops in to say hello and ends up extending the band’s creative life by a year. Preston, whom they instantly recognise to be an astonishing musician, reminds them of an aspect of collaboration that they had been in danger of forgetting: joy. Then there is Peter Jackson. Only Jackson could have made this film, for three reasons. First, he’s a deep, deep Beatles nerd, who understands the significance of every moment captured on this film, and whose love for the band meant he was prepared to give up nearly four years of his working life in order to make it. Second, he is a master storyteller and a director of stature who clearly wasn’t ever going to be pushed around by Apple or Disney. Third, he is a technology enthusiast, on a project where the technical challenges were immense and fundamental. That’s a freakishly apt combination of attributes and yet, well, this is The Beatles.</span></p></div><p><span>Michael Lindsay-Hogg has received a bad press from this series. I mean, I get it, but my main feeling towards him is one of gratitude. Thank you for putting cameras and mics absolutely bloody everywhere, even in a flowerpot. Thank you for giving us this up-close look at the creative life of the greatest band that ever lived. Thank you for being brave enough, or insensitive enough, to ask such direct questions. </span><em>So you and Paul aren’t getting on so well, right? </em><span>The same robust ego that made him ask about Libya and children’s hospitals every five minutes also got the members of the band talking more about each other than they would have done otherwise.</span></p><p><span>And remember: MLH had an impossible job! He’d been invited to make a film by a client who then withdrew their cooperation, at least partially. This is something that Paul (of course) acknowledges, in a moment </span><a href="https://theymaybeparted.com/2013/08/14/jan-7-on-their-own-at-the-holiday-camp/" rel="">that didn’t make into </a><em><a href="https://theymaybeparted.com/2013/08/14/jan-7-on-their-own-at-the-holiday-camp/" rel="">Get Back</a></em><span>, possibly because it includes rather colourful swearing. McCartney was producing a record for the singer Jackie Lomax at this time. Referring to MLH, he says, “Any other director in the world would say, ‘Fuck off. Get off my set, you cunt.’ I mean, wouldn’t you? I couldn’t operate…if Jackie in the middle of the album said he won’t do it, we wouldn’t have the album.”</span><br></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>The decision paralysis afflicting the group meant that the rooftop concert nearly didn’t happen right up until the last minute. According to a recent </span><a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/saturday/audio/2018823241/michael-lindsay-hogg-the-unlikely-star-in-new-beatles-film-get-back" rel="">radio interview with MLH</a><span> (who, you’ll be glad to hear, sounds in his eighties just as irrepressible as he does in the film), the Beatles were still debating whether or not to do it when they were literally about to step out on to the roof. </span></p><p><span>In one of the vox pops, a puzzled passer-by asks why they didn’t play where people could see them. This is a fair question. Perhaps because they were only playing for themselves. It was certainly a crazy idea - to play live but in a way that they couldn’t be seen or even heard properly; to play only new songs, rather than any songs the crowd might just have recognised. It was wrong in so many ways, and yet it became one of their finest moments. Another beautiful Beatles fluke.</span></p><p><span> In George Saunders’ book about creative writing, </span><em>A Swim In The Pond In The Rain</em><span>, he quotes Einstein to the effect that “no worthy problem is ever solved within the plane of its original conception.” The rooftop concert didn’t answer the question they started with, but it was a perfect answer nonetheless.</span></p><p><span>My favourite moment from the rooftop - ah, there are many. But if I had to pick one, it’s a shot that lasts about a second during their first performance of </span><em>Get Back</em><span>. When the beat kicks in and Billy Preston hits that riff we get an overhead shot (well, a shot from the other roof). We had overhead shots of them at Twickenham, marooned on a little island in that vast expanse of linoleum. Here, we look down on them and they’re </span><em>dancing</em><span>. Now, it’s cold, for sure. But to me, this is the precise moment when John, in particular, thinks FUCK YEAH, </span><em>this</em><span> is what it’s all about (maybe he’s not thinking it, but he’s got that feeling). When did they last dance like that on stage? Not at Candlestick Park or the London Palladium or the BBC. They are dancing like they danced at the Cavern or the Kaiserkeller. Except here they’re dancing like nobody’s watching.</span></p><div><p><em>“Writing is a technical process that results in a mystical experience.”</em><br><span>George Saunders</span></p><p><span>There’s a truism in sport that what makes a champion is not the level they play at when they’re in top form but how well they play when they’re not in form. When we meet The Beatles in </span><em>Get Back</em><span>, they’re clearly in a dip, and that’s what makes their response to it so impressive. Even the best songs they bring in are not necessarily very good to begin with. </span><em>Don’t Let Me Down</em><span> is not up to much at Twickenham. George calls it corny, and he isn’t wrong. But John has a vision of a song that eschews irony and sophistication and lunges straight for your heart, and he achieves it, with a little help from his friends. They keep running at the song, shaping it and honing it, and by the time they get to the roof it is majestic.</span></p></div><p><span>The already classic scene in which Paul wrenches the song </span><em>Get Back</em><span> out of himself shows us, not just a moment of inspiration, but how the group pick up on what is not an obviously promising fragment and begin the process of turning it into a song. In the days to follow, they keep going at it, day after day, run-through after run-through, chipping away, laboriously sculpting the song into something that seems, in its final form, perfectly effortless. As viewers, we get bored of seeing them rehearse it and we see only some of it: on January 23rd alone they ran it through </span><a href="http://www.beatlesebooks.com/get-back" rel="">43 times</a><span>. The Beatles don’t know, during this long process, what we know - that they’re creating a song that millions of people will sing and move to for decades to come. For all they know, it might be Shit Takes all the way down. But they keep going, changing the lyrics, making small decision after small decision - when the chorus comes in, where to put the guitar solo, when to syncopate the beat, how to play the intro - in the blind faith that somewhere, hundreds of decisions down the line, a Beatles song worthy of the name will emerge.</span></p><p><span>A good song or album - or novel or painting - seems authoritative and inevitable, as if it just had to be that way, but it rarely feels like that to the people making it. Art involves a kind of conjuring trick in which the artist conceals her false starts, her procrastination, her self-doubts, her confusion, behind the finished article. The Beatles did so well at effacing their efforts that we are suspicious they actually had to make any, which is why the words “magic” and “genius” get used so much around them. A work of genius inspires awe in a lesser artist, but it’s not necessarily inspiring. In </span><em>Get Back</em><span>, we are allowed into The Beatles’ process. We see the mess; we live the boredom. We watch them struggle, and somehow it doesn’t diminish the magic at all. In a sense, Paul has finally got his wish: </span><em>Let It Be</em><span> is not just an album anymore. Joined up with </span><em>Get Back</em><span>, it is an exploration of the artistic journey - that long and winding road. It is about how hard it is to create something from nothing, and why we do it, despite everything.</span></p><p><span>After the rooftop The Beatles and their gang listen back to the recording of what they did up there. In this scene, I really feel like I’m in there with them, exchanging grins, seat-dancing away. It’s a joyous moment and it seems like a natural end to the series - certainly, Jackson could have ended it there if he wanted. But then we hear Paul suggesting they get back to work, and instead of saying screw </span><em>that</em><span> we’re getting drunk for a fortnight, everyone agrees. As it turns out, the studio isn’t ready, so they come in the next day to do the songs that weren’t suitable for the roof.</span></p><p><span>The closing sequence is from that last day. An exhausted contentment prevails. They play the same few songs over and over and over: </span><em>Two of Us, Long and Winding Road, Let It Be</em><span>. They start to look bored, glassy-eyed, and the silly voices creep in, but they keep going. As they begin yet another run-through of </span><em>Let It Be</em><span>, we get one of those magical subtitles that signify </span><em>this is it</em><span> - this is the take we’ve been listening to all these years. </span></p><p><span>When it comes to an end, John, who is sitting on the floor with his guitar, says, “I thought that was rather grand. I’d take one home with me.” Paul asks Glyn if it was good enough. Glyn says yes. Paul says, “We’ll do one more, just to cover ourselves.” John has a grumble, puts his cigarette out, and gets ready to go again.</span><br></p><p><em>This post is free to read so feel free to share.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Around 40% of <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/antarctica/t-38775585">Antarctica's</a> ice shelves shrunk in the past 25 years, according to a new study published on Thursday.</p>

<p>Scientists found 68 of Antarctica's 162 ice shelves experienced a "statistically significant" <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/antarctic-winter-sea-ice-hits-extreme-record-low/a-66923413">reduction in mass</a> between 1997 and 2021.</p>

<h2>The role of ice shelves</h2>

<p>Ice shelves are freshwater extensions of the ice sheets that cover much of Antarctica.</p>

<p>The sheets&nbsp;float on the ocean waters surrounding the continent and stabilize <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/antarctic-warm-water-eroding-thwaites-glacier-study-shows/a-64716496">glaciers</a> by slowing down the flow of ice into the ocean. When ice shelves shrink, the rate of ice loss from glaciers increases.</p>

<p>Melting ice shelves can also dilute the salt water around Antarctica. This, in turn,&nbsp;slows its ability to transport&nbsp;vital nutrients, such as heat and carbon, to and from the polar ecosystem.</p>

<p>The study's authors stated&nbsp;these changes were <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/large-ozone-hole-detected-over-antarctica/a-67019103">the result of&nbsp;climate change</a>.</p>

<p>"We are seeing a steady attrition due to melting and calving... This is further evidence that Antarctica is changing because the climate is warming," said Anna Hogg, a University of Leeds professor who co-authored the study.</p><div><h2 aria-label="Embedded video — How Amazon dolphins in Brazil became climate change victims"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20"><g fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"></path></g></svg>How Amazon dolphins in Brazil became climate change victims</h2><video id="video-67008342" controls="" playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="67008342" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/66986009_605.webp" data-duration="02:03"><source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20231005_dolphin12d_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"><source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20231005_dolphin12d_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"><p>To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a></p></video></div>

<p>The European Commission wants to turn digital communication apps, such as WhatsApp, iMessage, Instagram, TikTok and X, into mass surveillance tools so that digital communications of all EU citizens, including their live conversations, photos and videos, can be automatically scanned for criminal offences.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Even of citizens who are not suspected of any crime. This proposal for a CSAM regulation has been unanimously condemned by hundreds of academics,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> privacy regulators,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> and even internal legal experts at the Council of the European Union itself for its gross violation of privacy rights,<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> but also because the technology to be used to implement it is fundamentally flawed. Indeed, artificial intelligence cannot accurately detect criminal activity, but will falsely report millions of innocent citizens as suspects. Meanwhile, criminals easily circumvent this system by deleting these apps from their phones or disappearing on the dark web. While ineffective, European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson’s proposal does mean an end to private digital conversations for everyone and, for obvious reasons, is incompatible with the right to privacy and freedom of communication and the presumption of innocence.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> On Thursday 14 September, it emerged that there is insufficient support in the Council of the European Union for her proposal.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Worryingly, a day later, on 15 September, the Commissioner commissioned a paid advertising campaign on X (formerly Twitter) targeting the Netherlands,<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> Sweden,<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> Belgium,<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> Finland,<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> Slovenia,<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> Portugal<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> and the Czech Republic,<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a> countries that did not want to vote for the current proposal, according to leaked minutes from the 14 September meeting. The campaign, which has been viewed more than four million times, uses shocking images of young girls alongside sinister-looking men, ominous music, and commits a form of emotional blackmail by suggesting that opponents of the proposed legislation would not want to protect children.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> Equally misleading is its claim that the proposed legislation would be supported by the majority of Europeans based on a survey that highlighted only the benefits but not the drawbacks of the proposed legislation. On the contrary, surveys by research firms YouGov<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> and Novus,<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> which highlighted the drawbacks, showed virtually no support for the proposal among the European population.</p>

<p>To sway European public opinion, however, the European Commission went even further. X’s Transparency Report shows that the European Commission also used ‘microtargeting’ to ensure that the ads did not appear to people who care about privacy (people interested in Julian Assange) and eurosceptics (people interested in ‘nexit’, ‘brexit’ and ‘spanexit’ or in Victor Orbán, Nigel Farage, or the German political party AfD).<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> For unclear reasons, people interested in Christianity were also excluded. After excluding critical political and religious groups, X’s algorithm was set to find people in the remaining population who were indeed interested in the ad message, resulting in an uncritical echo chamber. This microtargeting on political and religious beliefs violates X’s advertising policy,<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> the Digital Services Act<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> – which the Commission itself has to oversee – and the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>If there is insufficient support for a proposed legislation, the only proper democratic response is to withdraw it or, as Germany suggested, to amend the proposal so that it <em>does</em> have sufficient support, in this case not introducing the unconstitutional “telescreen”, which seems to come straight out of Orwell’s book. And not, as the Commission has now tried to do, put pressure on doubting member states by trying to bend the views of their citizens to its will with tactics eerily reminiscent of the disinformation campaigns during the US elections<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a> and Brexit,<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a> such as the use of manipulative advertising, misleading statistics and micro-targeting based on religion and belief.</p>
<p>By setting aside European values in its quest to push through a controversial piece of legislation, the Commission is not only doing a disservice to the citizens it represents, but also endangering the foundations of the Union itself. Therefore, the European Commission should take the ad campaigns offline and keep them offline, and refrain from future attempts to bend European public opinion to its will with manipulative disinformation campaigns through illegal ads on social media.</p>
