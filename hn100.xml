            <div itemprop="articleBody">
                <p>Clickbait-y title, I know :D but I stand by it!</p>
<p>I noticed that many people still treat email like some sort of second-class citizen when it comes to personal information, and the urgency here is real.
I think, in today's world where everything is in apps and requires an account, email has become even more important than your <strong>home address</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why Your Email Is Your Digital Home</h2>
<p>Think about it for a moment. What would happen to you if you lost access to your email and needed to change it? Now, compare that to changing your home address.</p>
<p>For the second one, maybe you'd need to change some delivery addresses, and update government documents and bills. But that's common practice, and most places probably have procedures to handle that, and it's still not that many places. It's a solvable chore.</p>
<p>Now think if you lost access to your email address. What would you have to do to fix it? Create a new one, fine. But how will you log into all of your apps where the identifier is the email address itself? You need to contact each of the companies through their customer service, which is often painful.</p>
<p>And think how many conversations you would have to have? Uber? Customer service. Netflix? Customer service. YouTube/Google? Customer service. It's just a <strong>nightmare</strong>.</p>
<p>Look at how many important things you are getting today in your emails. Invoices → email. Password resets → email. Security notices → email.</p>
<p>My point here is that email has become our second home address on the internet. And we use that one piece of personal information way more than our normal address these days.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The "How": Taking Control of Your Email</h2>
<p>Okay, so the boring "why" we covered. Now it's the part where I'm showing you how to deal with it.</p>
<p>I will show you how I have it set up.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Get Your Own Domain</h3>
<p>The biggest problem with free email addresses is that they are under someone else's domain, so they have <strong>full control</strong> over your email address.</p>
<p>To fix that, you first need to have your email address under your <strong>own domain</strong>.</p>
<p>For that, you need to find a provider that is well-respected in the "email community." Why? Because the email protocol is quite an interesting case of "we don't ditch old stuff." To properly use email without constant rejection from various email providers, your domain needs to be "known" by them. So, setting up your own email server is, in practice, out of the question.</p>
<p>But you can go, for example, with Google (G Suite/Google Workspace), or with Proton Email, or anything else that is somewhat well known.</p>
<p>I went with G Suite from Google because it comes with a slightly different privacy policy than normal Gmail, and only G Suite offers custom domains in the Google ecosystem. So, to ease myself from having a second, secondary Gmail, I went with this one. But others are also viable options.</p>
<p>Next, you need to follow the instructions of your chosen provider to set up your own email address on your domain. In practice, it will involve setting <strong>DNS MX records</strong> for your domain and some verification.</p>
<p>Oh, and I highly recommend providers that offer a <strong>"catch-all" feature</strong>. This way, you can have one main email address and unlimited <code>&lt;put something here&gt;@yourdomain.com</code> email addresses. It's useful to have it separated, like <code><a href="https://karboosx.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="b4dad1c0d2d8ddccf4cddbc1c6d0dbd9d5ddda9ad7dbd9">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>, but still receive the emails inside the same inbox.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Step 2: The Unbannable Backup</h3>
<p>Now, you have your domain, and your email is under that domain. We don't stop here. Your emails are still inside your email provider. If they block you, you will probably lose access to previous emails, but at least now you have the option to just switch MX records to a different provider to start receiving emails again.</p>
<p>But we don't want that! We want <strong>full control</strong> over our emails!!!</p>
<p>So how do we handle it? Simple: making a <strong>backup</strong>!</p>
<p>The easiest would be to set up your local email software like Outlook or Thunderbird to download all emails to your local computer. It's something, and it will work, but if you happen to have some local server, I have a better proposition.</p>
<p>Set up some simple email server on your local server. I'm using my <strong>NAS</strong>. Just pick a subdomain for your email so it will look like <code><a href="https://karboosx.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="492b282a223c39092b282a223c396730263c3b2d2624282027672a2624">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>.</p>
<p>With your simple local email server, you can set up your email provider to <strong>always forward</strong> any email to your local server.</p>
<p>With that, you will always have a copy of every email on your server. So even if you are on vacation and your service provider blocks you from accessing your inbox, you will still have your copy.</p>
<p>graph LR
    A[Author/Sender] --&gt; B(Your Email Provider);
    B --&gt; C(Online Inbox/Access);
    B -- Forward Email --&gt; D(Local Backup Server);
    D --&gt; E[Your Local Email Copy];
</p>
<p>And would you like to hear the bonus tip? With this solution, there's a high chance that if they ban you by mistake (AI bots are to blame), they will <strong>not disable the forwarding mechanism</strong>. They will just not allow you to authenticate to your account. That means you will still be able to read all your emails even when banned from your inbox!</p>
<hr>
<p>So there you have it. That's my method for making your most important internet asset, your email, truly <strong>unbannable</strong> and resilient. It takes a little setup, but the peace of mind knowing that I'm in control of my digital life—not some huge corporation—is totally worth it. Now go take back control!</p>

Today, we are releasing the <a href="http://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/computer-use">Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model</a>, our new specialized model built on Gemini 2.5 Pro’s visual understanding and reasoning capabilities that powers agents capable of interacting with user interfaces (UIs). It outperforms leading alternatives on multiple web and mobile control benchmarks, all with lower latency. Developers can access these capabilities via the Gemini API in <a href="http://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/computer-use">Google AI Studio</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/computer-use">Vertex AI</a>.</p><p data-block-key="b74v6">While AI models can interface with software through structured APIs, many digital tasks still require direct interaction with graphical user interfaces, for example, filling and submitting forms. To complete these tasks, agents must navigate web pages and applications just as humans do: by clicking, typing and scrolling. The ability to natively fill out forms, manipulate interactive elements like dropdowns and filters, and operate behind logins is a crucial next step in building powerful, general-purpose agents.</p><h2 data-block-key="2t6df">How it works</h2><p data-block-key="7bmpr">The model’s core capabilities are exposed through the new `computer_use` tool in the Gemini API and should be operated within a loop. Inputs to the tool are the user request, screenshot of the environment, and a history of recent actions. The input can also specify whether to exclude functions from the <a href="http://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/computer-use#supported-actions">full list of supported UI actions</a> or specify additional custom functions to include.</p></div>

Thus, it is critical to implement safety guardrails with care.</p><p data-block-key="ab068">We have trained safety features directly into the model to address these three key risks (described in the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/Model-Cards/Gemini-2-5-Computer-Use-Model-Card.pdf">Gemini 2.5 Computer Use System Card</a>).</p><p data-block-key="7liej">Further, we also provide developers with safety controls, which empower developers to prevent the model from auto-completing potentially high-risk or harmful actions. Examples of these actions include harming a system's integrity, compromising security, bypassing CAPTCHAs, or controlling medical devices. The controls:</p><ul><li data-block-key="3f5gh"><b>Per-step safety service:</b> An out-of-model, inference-time safety service that assesses each action the model proposes before it’s executed.</li><li data-block-key="cu905"><b>System instructions:</b> Developers can further specify that the agent either refuses or asks for user confirmation before it takes specific kinds of high-stakes actions.

It came along at just the right moment as Elon Musk’s purchase and takeover of Twitter led millions of users head toward any type of exit.</p><p>The initial destination for many was Mastodon, but its Linux geek ethos and system of numerous “federated” servers that communicate via the open-source ActivityPub protocol proved to be too complicated for people who just wanted to crack jokes. Acting on the opportunity, Bluesky opened up to the public in February 2024 and saw a rapid influx of users.</p><p><span>Besides being easier to sign up and use than Mastodon, Bluesky offered a different approach to content moderation that was more flexible and user-driven. In addition to making its software source code available under open licenses, Bluesky wanted to put moderation decisions in the hands of its users, encouraging them to make lists of accounts that could be automatically blocked or labeled—and thereby removing itself as much as possible from moderation decisions that have plagued discussion group administrators </span><a href="https://flux.community/matthew-sheffield/2021/11/problems-social-media-are-not-technology-challenges-they-are-social/" rel="">since the days of Usenet newsgroups</a><span>.</span></p><p>Millions of people flooded in after Bluesky opened its doors to the public. By November of 2024, there were nearly 1.5 million daily posters, most of them anti-Musk Twitter refugees who were eager to get away from Musk’s right-wing makeover of the site into X.</p><p><span>However, as time has gone by, </span><a href="https://bsky.jazco.dev/stats" rel="">Bluesky’s traffic has declined</a><span> (</span><a href="https://backlinko.com/twitter-users" rel="">X’s has as well</a><span>) and some of its users have become increasingly upset at its moderation decisions, including allowing U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/13/bluesky-is-at-a-crossroads-as-users-petition-to-ban-jesse-singal-over-anti-trans-views-harassment/" rel="">anti-trans writer Jesse Singal</a><span> to remain as users of the platform. Singal became a particular target, prompting a </span><a href="https://www.change.org/p/bluesky-must-enforce-its-community-guidelines-equally" rel="">petition</a><span> with more than 28,000 signatures urging Bluesky to “enforce its Community Guidelines” against him that has not been successful, although he has been </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/13/bluesky-is-at-a-crossroads-as-users-petition-to-ban-jesse-singal-over-anti-trans-views-harassment/" rel="">temporarily banned</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Accusations of indifference to anti-trans bigotry seem to have exacerbated some users’ frustrations with the platform for its alleged tolerance of racist content. In 2023, many launched a “</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/27/bluesky-racism-slur-apology-feedback/" rel="">posting strike</a><span>” after they discovered that Bluesky allowed people to sign up for user names containing racial slurs, a policy the company quickly reversed and apologized for.</span></p><p><span>The labeling feature of Bluesky has been more positively regarded, with many people subscribing to lists to label or block Trump supporters, Singal, and other widely disliked journalists. But things have not been perfect. Several users have complained about being added to libelously named lists, while others have complained that stalkers have added them to numerous lists out of revenge. Trying to balance concerns between legitimate blocklist maintainers and victims of false accusations, Bluesky </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/18/bluesky-addresses-trust-and-safety-concerns-around-abuse-spam-and-more/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="">unveiled a series of changes</a><span> to its </span><a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/tos" rel="">terms of service</a><span> which brought it more in line with other social platforms, but also sparked controversy because now users can get blocklists hidden by reporting on them.</span></p><p>The failure of the Singal ban effort has also continued to grate on Bluesky’s most persistent critics, and the site’s executives have been met with many critical and often off-topic replies and quote posts.</p><p>While Bluesky has been navigating user concerns, its engineering team has been moving ahead with its long-promised open source efforts, breaking up its software stack into several pieces to enable a federated Authenticated Transfer Protocol (ATProto) network where anyone with the know-how and funds could run their own copy of Bluesky.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ggf1!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ggf1!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ggf1!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ggf1!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ggf1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ggf1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png" width="708" height="575" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:575,&quot;width&quot;:708,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ggf1!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ggf1!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ggf1!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ggf1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e61cf95-68af-46bf-8f3c-c1213745ebdd_708x575.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>There are several key pieces of code that combine to make the Bluesky network function: A personal data server (PDS) which hosts the official/canonical copies of its users’ posts and profile information. Whenever it’s updated, the data is combined and sent to a Relay server, which combines and indexes posts from many different PDSes to create what social networks call the “firehose,” the collection of all posts made on the network.</p><p><span>The firehose data is imported by a labeler program which categorizes it in various ways set up by users, the processed data is combined together by an application server (or AppViews as they’re called </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pfrazee.com/post/3lyucxfxq622w" rel="">for now</a><span> in Bluesky). When a user logs into their PDS and pushes “refresh,” their local app connects to the PDS’s designated feed generator which serves up a cached version of the accounts they follow.</span></p><p><span>While the ATProto system has been criticized as overly complicated </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23689570/activitypub-protocol-standard-social-network" rel="">compared to the ActivityPub system</a><span> that powers the Fediverse, it has one key feature that ActivityPub lacks: the ability to transfer servers while keeping all of your followers and posts.</span></p><p>Due to the complexity of the Bluesky software stack, whether its federation model actually works in practice has not really been put to the test. While ActivityPub has several instances with millions of users (like Facebook Threads, Flipboard, and even Donald Trump’s Truth Social), it also has many much smaller ones run by small organizations and individuals.</p><p><span>As of this writing, however, the only completely independent implementation of ATProto is Bluesky. But that isn’t for want of trying on the part of Rudy Fraser, the creator of </span><a href="https://blacksky.community/" rel="">Blacksky</a><span>, an alternative service that he unveiled in May of 2023 in response to Black American users’ complaints about Bluesky’s moderation policies.</span></p><p>Despite Fraser’s efforts to implement his own PDS, Relay, and App View, however, Blacksky still remains partially dependent upon Bluesky’s application server, largely because while the code to implement the dataplane of posts and users within an application server is released, the open-source version is slower. As a result, Blacksky is dependent on Bluesky’s application server to give users a fast experience, which also means that it is dependent on Bluesky’s labeling system and its moderation choices.</p><p>The labeling software, called Ozone, also has issues, according to Bluesky engineer Bryan Newbold.</p><p>“Making it easier to run moderation services is something we want to do. we invested a lot of time and effort in Ozone, but have not been able to focus on making it usable/accessible for independent folks,” he wrote in an Oct. 3 post, adding that “we are looking at funding folks to fork or re-implement it for community use-case.”</p><p>This limitation is likely to be another reason why Blacksky relies on Bluesky's AppView. Without it, Blacksky’s independent moderators couldn't actually perform their task. (Fraser did not respond to repeated attempts to contact him for comment.)</p><p>Blacksky’s continued dependency on Bluesky came into focus on Sunday after a Blacksky user going by the handle Link suddenly found himself unable to view his own posts on the alternative site.</p><p><span>“My account was taken down without any explanation for almost a full day,” Link told me in a Signal message, showing me a screenshot indicating that he had been banned even as his Blacksky account remained capable of viewing others’ posts and changing preferences. Unbeknownst to him, Link’s account had been banned by Bluesky’s moderators and this meant that even though he was in good standing at Blacksky, no one there, including himself, was able to read his posts. (They are visible </span><a href="https://pdsls.dev/at://did:plc:63hvnyjvqi2nzzcsjgnry5we/app.bsky.feed.post" rel="">within the ATProto firehose feed</a><span>, however, as several sharp-eyed users soon discovered.)</span></p><p><span>Link’s banning came at a very bad moment for Bluesky, just weeks after it had banned or suspended several users following the Sept. 10 murder of far-right activist Charlie Kirk, which many Republican officials have sought to use as a tool for </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/kirk-trump-cancel-culture-assassination-4d69649e382ea46d8dcf794150a1d3c9" rel="">government censorship</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Federal Communications Commission Brendan Carr’s threats against late night comedian Jimmy Kimmel led to his temporary suspension by ABC, and he was far from the only Republican to issue them. Louisiana Rep. Clay Higgins, chair of the House subcommittee on federal law enforcement, </span><a href="https://clayhiggins.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/9.15.25_Rep.-Higgins-Letter-to-Big-Tech-re-Charlie-Kirk-1.pdf" rel="">sent a menacing letter</a><span> to Bluesky and other social media networks demanding that they identify and ban anyone deemed to be celebrating Kirk’s killing.</span></p><p>“The authors of these posts are to be identified and banned from your platform, as well as any new pages they may create,” he wrote. “The reasonable restriction of public statements that lie far beyond the standards of our own society is not an oppression of free speech, it is, rather, the protection of free speech.”</p><p><span>There’s no proof that Higgins’s threats against social media platforms led to Bluesky banning anyone, but in any case, more than a few users were permanently or temporarily banned for mocking Kirk’s death, including horror author </span><a href="https://www.tcj.com/horror-it-girl-gretchen-felker-martin-on-dc-pulling-red-hood-after-charlie-kirk-comments-i-had-no-regrets/" rel="">Gretchen Felker-Martin</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The fallout from the Kirk controversies and the months of replies seems to have irked Bluesky CEO Jay Graber, and she began pushing back on the user complaints. On Oct. 1, she </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m25dl2ibnc2y" rel="">approvingly quoted</a><span> a user who had referenced the famous </span><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/no-bitch-dats-a-whole-new-x-wtf-is-you-talkin-about" rel="">pancakes-waffle Twitter meme</a><span> about how liking pancakes doesn’t mean disliking waffles, adding: “Too real. We’re going to try to fix this. Social media doesn’t have to be this way.”</span></p><p><span>Graber’s post was soon met by </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/antioccident.bsky.social/post/3m25emit7w22r" rel="">a reply</a><span> asking if she’d banned Singal yet, prompting her to </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m25esnq4t22y" rel="">respond</a><span> in all-caps: “WAFFLES.”</span></p><p><span>The next day, Thursday, Graber returned to her theme, </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3m2a73ot5uk2e" rel="">posting a photograph</a><span> of a berry-covered waffle, accompanied with the caption: “Amazing breakfast this morning. I love waffles.”</span></p><p><span>As might be expected, Graber’s trolling was not taken well by her critics.

After receiving no contact from either Blacksky or Bluesky, Link messaged Bluesky’s moderation team and received </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aliafonzy.blacksky.app/post/3m2jm7ugr6k2y" rel="">an email</a><span> about 3 hours later saying that he had violated the social network’s community guidelines in his quote of Graber days earlier, presumably its policies against “threats or encouragement of violence.”</span></p><p>That is not how Link sees his post.</p><p><span>“I want to be extremely clear I was not making a death threat or inciting violence,” he told me, saying that he had sent 12 separate examples of other people posting the same Kirk image as a </span><a href="https://x.com/liv_agar/status/1975210544018989119?s=42" rel="">reaction meme</a><span>. “I don’t wish death on Jay, I wish for her and her team to grow a conscience.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-518759">

				


				


				<h3>from the <i>formerly-open-ecosystem</i> dept</h3>
				


				<p>It would be something of an understatement to say that Alphabet, Google’s holding company, is <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/GOOG:NASDAQ">big and successful</a>. Some Wall Street analysts are even predicting it could become the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-says-alphabet-googl-052439525.html">world’s most valuable corporation</a>. Of course, even for business giants, enough is never enough. They always want more: more money, more power. As part of that tendency, Google seems to have decided that <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a>, the free and open source app store for the Android platform, is a threat to the official Google Play Store that needs to be neutralized. At least that is likely to be the effect of Google’s announcement that it will <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html">require all Android developers to register and be verified</a> before their apps can be allowed to run on certified Android devices. A <a href="https://f-droid.org/2025/09/29/google-developer-registration-decree.html">post on the F-Droid blog</a> explains what the problem is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In addition to demanding payment of a registration fee and agreement to their (non-negotiable and ever-changing) terms and conditions, Google will also require the <a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification#verify-your-identity">uploading of personally identifying documents</a>, including government ID, by the authors of the software, as well as <a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification#register-your-apps">enumerating</a> all the unique “application identifiers” for every app that is to be distributed by the registered developer.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the blog post, the impact on the F-Droid project would be severe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>the developer registration decree will end the F-Droid project and other free/open-source app distribution sources as we know them today, and the world will be deprived of the safety and security of the catalog of thousands of apps that can be trusted and verified by any and all. F-Droid’s myriad users will be left adrift, with no means to install — or even update their existing installed — applications.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html">Google says</a> registration is needed to “better protect users from repeat bad actors spreading malware and scams”. Registration “creates crucial accountability, making it much harder for malicious actors to quickly distribute another harmful app after we take the first one down.” Slightly less convenient, perhaps, but not much harder. The F-Droid blog post points out that its open source app store already has a far better approach to security than Google’s proposed registration and verification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>every [F-Droid] app is free and open source, the code can be audited by anyone, the build process and logs are public, and reproducible builds ensure that what is published matches the source code exactly. This transparency and accountability provides a stronger basis for trust than closed platforms, while still giving users freedom to choose. Restricting direct app installation not only undermines that choice, it also erodes the diversity and resilience of the open-source ecosystem by consolidating control in the hands of a few corporate players.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google is at pains to emphasize “Verified developers will have the same freedom to distribute their apps directly to users through sideloading or through any app store they prefer.” But that’s not true: their “freedom” will be soon be conditional, subject to Google’s whim and veto (as the company’s recent <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-calls-ice-agents-a-vulnerable-group-removes-ice-spotting-app-red-dot/">removal of the ICE-spotting app ‘Red Dot’</a> demonstrates). As a special concession, the company says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>we are also introducing a free developer account type that will allow teachers, students, and hobbyists to distribute apps to a limited number of devices without needing to provide a government ID.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But again that is subject to Google’s approval, and only allows distribution to a “limited number of devices” – a circumscribed “freedom”, in other words. And for F-Droid it’s not even an option, because of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>How many F-Droid users are there, exactly? We don’t know, because we don’t track users or have any registration: <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/2022/02/28/no-user-accounts-by-design.html">“No user accounts, by design”</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the F-Droid post comments, Google’s move is not credibly about “security”, but actually about “consolidating power and tightening control over a formerly open ecosystem”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If you own a computer, you should have the right to run whatever programs you want on it. This is just as true with the apps on your Android/iPhone mobile device as it is with the applications on your Linux/Mac/Windows desktop or server. Forcing software creators into a centralized registration scheme in order to publish and distribute their works is as egregious as forcing writers and artists to register with a central authority in order to be able to distribute their creative works. It is an offense to the core principles of free speech and thought that are central to the workings of democratic societies around the world.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google’s attack on F-Droid is ironic. At the heart of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a>, and the key element that allowed it to become so successful so quickly, is the GPL-licensed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel">Linux kernel</a>. Over the years, Google has increased its control over Android by adding more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)#Licensing">non-free elements</a>. If, as seems likely, its latest move leads to the shutdown of the <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/2025/09/04/twif.html">15-year-old F-Droid platform</a>, it would represent a further betrayal of the open source world it once supported.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) is a novel approach using two small neural networks recursing at different frequencies. This biologically inspired method beats Large Language models (LLMs) on hard puzzle tasks such as Sudoku, Maze, and ARC-AGI while trained with small models (27M parameters) on small data (around 1000 examples). HRM holds great promise for solving hard problems with small networks, but it is not yet well understood and may be suboptimal. We propose Tiny Recursive Model (TRM), a much simpler recursive reasoning approach that achieves significantly higher generalization than HRM, while using a single tiny network with only 2 layers. With only 7M parameters, TRM obtains 45% test-accuracy on ARC-AGI-1 and 8% on ARC-AGI-2, higher than most LLMs (e.g., Deepseek R1, o3-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with less than 0.01% of the parameters.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) paid $825,000 earlier this year to a company that manufactures vehicles equipped with various technologies for law enforcement, including fake cellphone towers known as “cell-site simulators,” which&nbsp;can be used to spy on nearby phones. &nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/fpdsportal?q=TECHOPS+SPECIALTY+VEHICLES%2C+LLC++AGENCY_NAME%3A%22Immigration+and+Customs+Enforcement%22&amp;s=FPDS.GOV&amp;templateName=1.5.3&amp;indexName=awardfull&amp;sortBy=SIGNED_DATE&amp;desc=Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">public records</a>, the award dated May 8 “provides Cell Site Simulator (CSS) Vehicles to support the Homeland Security Technical Operations program” and is a modification for “additional CSS Vehicles.” &nbsp;</p>







<p>The contract was signed with TechOps Specialty Vehicles (TOSV), a Maryland-based company. TOSV also signed a similar contract with ICE in September 2024 for $818,000, showing that the relationship between the agency and the company predates the Trump administration. &nbsp;</p>

<p>TOSV president Jon Brianas told TechCrunch in an email that he could not provide details about the ICE contracts and the vehicles, citing “trade secrets.” But Brianas did confirm that the company does provide cell-site simulators, although it does not make them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We don’t manufacture electrical, comms, and technology components, we integrate that product into our overall design of the vehicle,” said Brianas, who declined to say from where TOSV sources its cell-site simulators. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the latest federal contract that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/heres-the-tech-powering-ices-deportation-crackdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveals some of the technologies</a> powering the Trump administration’s deportation crackdown.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In early September, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/the-wiretap/2025/09/09/how-ice-is-using-fake-cell-towers-to-spy-on-peoples-phones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forbes found a recently unsealed search warrant</a> that showed that ICE used a cell-site simulator to track down a person who allegedly was part of a criminal gang in the United States, and who had been ordered to leave the country in 2023.&nbsp;In the article, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/the-wiretap/2025/09/09/how-ice-is-using-fake-cell-towers-to-spy-on-peoples-phones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forbes reported</a> that it also found a contract for “cell site simulator vehicles,” but the article did not name the company that provides the vans to the agency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cell-site simulators also go by the name “stingrays” because some of the earlier types of these devices, made by defense contractor Harris (now L3Harris), were named that way. Since then, stingrays have become a catch-all name for this type of technology, also known as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/02/who-catches-the-imsi-catchers-researchers-demonstrate-stingray-detection-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IMSI catchers</a>. (IMSI stands for International Mobile Subscriber Identity, a unique number that identifies every cellphone user in the world.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the name suggests, cell-site simulator tools can mimic a cellphone tower, tricking every phone in its nearby range to connect to the device and thus giving law enforcement the ability to better identify the real-world location of those phones and their owners. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Some cell-site simulators can also intercept regular calls, text messages, and internet traffic.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Authorities can get data from traditional cellphone towers to find the current or past location of a suspect, but the location is usually not very precise. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Stingray-like devices have been in use by law enforcement for more than a decade and have long been controversial because authorities do not always get a warrant for their use, and <a href="https://sls.eff.org/technologies/cell-site-simulators-imsi-catchers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">critics say</a> these devices ensnare innocent people by default.&nbsp;These devices are also shrouded in secrecy, because the law enforcement agencies that use them are under strict non-disclosure agreements not to reveal how the devices work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ICE has a long history of using cell-site simulators. In 2020, documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union showed that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/aclu-ice-stingray-documents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ICE deployed them at least 466 times between 2017 and 2019</a>. The agency used these tools more than 1,885 times between 2013 and 2017, <a href="http://buzzfeednews.com/article/adolfoflores/this-is-how-many-times-the-department-of-homeland-security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News</a> at the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ICE acknowledged TechCrunch’s request for comment, but did not respond to a series of questions, which included: what ICE uses these vehicles for, whether and where they have recently been deployed, and whether the agency always gets a warrant when using cell-site simulators. &nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-from-surveillance-vans-to-bookmobiles-nbsp">From surveillance vans to bookmobiles&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Headquartered just outside of Washington, DC, TOSV sells a wide range of customizable vehicles to <a href="https://www.techopssv.com/law-enforcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">law enforcement</a>, such as vans for SWAT armed response teams, bomb squads, and so-called “mobile lab” and “cover surveillance” vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among these vehicles for police forces, TOSV lists several “projects,” including one described as <a href="https://www.techopssv.com/projects/dhs-mobile-forensic-labs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DHS Mobile Forensic Labs</a>, referring to the Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the website, these mobile forensic vans are “equipped for on-site forensic analysis and documentation,” have “secure compartments for evidence preservation and investigative tools,” and enable “seamless case file updates and evidence logging.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another project is the <a href="https://www.techopssv.com/projects-1/dhs-mobile-command-van" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DHS Mobile Command Van</a>,” which TOSV says is “configurable for advanced surveillance and mission coordination.” &nbsp;</p>







<p>It’s unclear if these vans are the same vehicles that include cell-site simulators, as there’s no mention of the phone surveillance tool anywhere on TOSV’s website. &nbsp;</p>

<p>ICE has other contracts with TOSV for mobile forensic labs, which don’t specify which technologies are located in the vans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to its website, TOSV also sells so-called “<a href="https://www.techopssv.com/community-outreach" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">bookmobiles</a>,” which appear to be libraries on wheels, as well as <a href="https://www.techopssv.com/medical-projects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">medical</a> and <a href="http://techopssv.com/fire-and-ems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fire department</a> vehicles.</p>

  <p><em>Kevin</em>: Hey, have you tried Vite for Rails 8? It’s insanely fast.</p><p><em>John</em>: I’ve heard of it. Isn’t that a build tool? Didn’t Rails already come with one?</p><p><em>K</em>: Well, it did, but Vite is like… modern. You’ll need to install Node, npm, and configure a few scripts, but it’s totally worth it.</p><p><em>J</em>: Wait, Rails needs Node now?</p><p><em>K</em>: Well, yeah — if you want to use React. Everyone’s using React.</p><p><em>J</em>: Didn’t Rails have something for that?</p><p><em>K</em>: It did, but now you’ll want to use Vite with React Refresh so you get instant component reloads. And if you want TypeScript support, you’ll have to configure that too.</p><p><em>J</em>: Sounds… like a lot.</p><p><em>K</em>: Oh, not really. Just install Babel, configure your .babelrc, add vite-plugin-ruby, then you’ll want PostCSS for your styles.</p><p><em>J</em>: PostCSS?</p><p><em>K</em>: Yeah, and then Tailwind, obviously — you don’t want to write CSS like a peasant.</p><p><em>J</em>: Of course not.</p><p><em>K</em>: Then you’ll probably want to add ESLint and Prettier to make sure your code looks clean, and maybe Husky for pre-commit hooks.</p><p><em>J</em>: So... Vite, React, Babel, PostCSS, Tailwind, ESLint, Prettier, Husky. That’s it?</p><p><em>K</em>: Pretty much. Oh, unless you want server-side rendering — then you’ll need Next.js or Remix.</p><p><em>J</em>: Wait, we’re still talking about a Rails app, right?</p><p><em>K</em>: Yeah, but hybrid stacks are the way to go! You could also use StimulusReflex or Hotwire if you want reactive components without JS frameworks.</p><p><em>J</em>: StimulusReflex sounds like a Marvel character.</p><p><em>K</em>: Ha! No, it’s for real-time updates. But you’ll need ActionCable configured, Redis running, and—</p><p><em>J</em>: Redis?</p><p><em>K</em>: Yeah, you need a pub/sub layer. Don’t worry, it’s just another Docker container.</p><p><em>J</em>: Docker too?</p><p><em>K</em>: Yeah, to isolate your dependencies. And if you want everything reproducible, you’ll need Docker Compose, maybe Fly.io for deployment, and a build pipeline with GitHub Actions.</p><p><em>J</em>: That’s... quite a setup.</p><p><em>K</em>: It’s just modern web development, man. Keeps things simple. What are you doing?</p><p><em>J</em>: Just tinkering.</p><p><em>(John runs a single command. The app boots instantly, working forms, instant loading times, blazing fast navigation.)</em></p><p><em>K</em>: Wow, that looks like a pretty complex setup. What stack’s that?</p><p><em>J</em>: Vanilla Rails.</p><p><em>Just F#$%^&amp; use Rails.</em></p>

<p>In May, <a href="https://www.404media.co/a-texas-cop-searched-license-plate-cameras-nationwide-for-a-woman-who-got-an-abortion/"><u>404 Media reported</u></a> that the Johnson County Sheriff’s Office in Texas searched a nationwide network of Flock cameras, a powerful AI-enabled license plate surveillance tool, to look for a woman who self-administered an abortion. At the time, the sheriff told us that the search had nothing to do with criminality and that they were concerned solely about the woman’s safety, specifically the idea that she could be bleeding to death from the abortion. Flock itself said “she was never under criminal investigation by Johnson County. She was being searched for as a missing person, not as a suspect of a crime.”</p>

				<h2>Discover your timeline</h2>
				<p>
						Timelinize <span>("time-lynn-eyes")</span> is an open source personal archival suite, designed for modern family history. It organizes all your data onto a single, unified timeline on your own computer.

				<h2>A place for everything...</h2>
				<p>
					Photos, videos, text messages, locations, chats, social media, and more. Timelinize unifies it all.
				</p>
				<p>
					By adding all your data, Timelinize documents your family's life with more detail and privacy, and gives you a more complete view of your story, than standard photo library and journaling apps.
				</p>

				

				<h2>...and everything at home.</h2>
				<p>
					Most apps store your data "in the cloud" and <i>out of your control</i>. What if you lost access to your Google/Apple/Facebook accounts, or your phone? By bringing that data home to your own computer, Timelinize preserves a richer story than any one app or service can do alone.
				</p>
				<p>
					Timelinize isn't a replacement for the apps and services you already use, so you don't need to disrupt your way of life. Instead, it "sits behind" what you already use to become the permanent private archive of your working copy from:

							<h3>Entity-aware processing</h3>
							<p>
								Timelinize specializes in combining data from multiple sets and sources. It can identify people and other entities across data sources by their attributes. If a person or contact appears in multiple data sets, it will automatically merge them if possible. If not, you can easily merge entities with the click of a button.

							<h3>Magically geo-locate data without coordinates</h3>
							<p>
								Because Timelinize is entity-aware, it can project data points onto a map even without coordinate data. If a geolocated point is known for an entity around the same time of others of that entity's data points, it will appear on the map.
							</p>

					<h2>Features for humans</h2>

					<p>Since I need this to function well for my own family, I have tried to give special attention to less-visible aspects of this application, such as:</p>

					<div>
						<div>
							<h3>Advanced location processor</h3>
							<p>
								Timelinize deduplicates, denoises, clusters, and simplifies location data for optimal preservation, with an algorithm that subjectively performs better than Google Maps Timeline.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>CLI and HTTP API</h3>
							<p>
								For nerds like me: you can use Timelinize through its CLI, which mirrors all the functions of the HTTP API used by the frontend.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Semantic search</h3>
							<p>
								Search for pictures and messages by describing them, or find similar items to what you're viewing.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Thumbnails and transcoding</h3>
							<p>
								All items are stored verbatim, then thumbnails are generated for all images and video media, which are stored separately. Your original data is not modified.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Flexible schema</h3>
							<p>
								The database schema has been meticulously designed and refined to be as adaptable as possible.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<h2>A timeline to the future</h2>

					<p>Timelinize will continue to develop and evolve. In the future, I anticipate the following capabilities:</p>

					<div>
						<div>
							<h3>Create using your timeline</h3>
							<p>
								Annotate your timeline, write rich stories with live embeddings from your timeline data, or make physical media like photo books (but with more than just photos!).
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Augment with public data</h3>
							<p>
								Add context to your timeline with additional public timelines which have weather, local/regional news, and global events.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Secure data sharing</h3>
							<p>
								Securely and privately share parts of your timeline with trusted friends and family members, directly from your computer to theirs.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Mobile apps and first-class sync</h3>
							<p>
								Right now, Timelinize sits "behind" the apps and platforms you already use. But in the future, you could sync data directly to your timeline as it is originated.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<h2>Meet your personal timeline</h2>

					<p>Collect your data from <a href="https://timelinize.com/docs/data-preparation#data-sources">various sources</a>. Import it with a few clicks. Within minutes, explore millions of your data points in several intuitive ways.</p>

					<div>
						<div>
							<h3>Self-contained, portable repositories</h3>
							<p>
								Imported data is copied into your timeline folder, ensuring long-term stability and integrity. Timelines are portable—you can copy them or move them to other devices and computers.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>No proprietary storage scheme</h3>
							<p>
								Your timeline is simply a folder on disk containing a SQLite database alongside your data files. You can freely explore it with other tooling, so you're not locked into Timelinize.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Works with data you're already generating</h3>
							<p>
								Unlike writing a journal, you don't have to take extra time to create content. You're already making the data your timeline can display! And it doesn't replace your current workflow or apps.
							</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    
    <div>
        <div>
                
                <h2>
                    IKEA catalogue                </h2>
                                    
	<div>
		<p>For over 70 years, the IKEA catalogue was produced in Älmhult, constantly growing in number, scope and distribution. From the 1950s when Ingvar Kamprad wrote most of the texts himself, via the poppy, somewhat radical 1970s and all the way into the scaled-down 2000s – the IKEA catalogue always captured the spirit of the time. The 2021 IKEA catalogue was the very last one printed on paper.</p>
		
	</div>
                  
            </div>                    
                        </div>
			<div>
					<div>
					<p>Good question! We know that a lot of people are curious about what the IKEA catalogue has looked like through the ages. The catalogue has always reflected the age and its views on interior design and everyday living, especially in Sweden, but in recent decades also internationally. The catalogue was in print for 70 years, and by digitising all the catalogues we could make them available to everybody. Making the story of IKEA available to as many people as possible is our main task at IKEA Museum. So we hope that the catalogues will bring some joy and nostalgia, and maybe even a few surprises.</p>
				</div>
					<div>
					<p>Just like the perception of the home, the catalogue has changed dramatically since 1951, when it was first published. Look in the older catalogues and you’ll be amazed at what you find. In fact, you’ll probably even have a giggle or two. In the 1950s and 1960s, there are rarely any people in the pictures, and never any children. But in the 1970s there are children playing all over the home, you can see adults smoking and even the occasional political poster on the wall. Browse on to the 1980s IKEA catalogues and the trends have changed again, with shiny fabrics and other fancy materials. In the 1990s homes become more scaled-down and clearly inspired by a Scandinavian tradition. In this way, the IKEA catalogues are a kind of time capsule for you to travel in. And who knows? When we look back at the most recent catalogues in 10 or 20 years’ time, we’ll probably shake our heads and give a sigh.</p>
				</div>
					<div>
					<p>IKEA Museum decided to start with the Swedish catalogue as it has been around the longest. In the future, we hope to be able to digitise catalogues from more countries in more languages. </p>
				</div>
					<div>
					<p>No. The IKEA catalogue has always only shown a selection of what’s available in the stores. The catalogues from the 1970s and onwards show around 30–50 per cent of the entire range. The products that are not featured are generally smaller ones in textiles, decorations and lighting. Temporary collections are rarely included either. But the farther back you go, the higher a percentage of the range can be found in the catalogue.</p>
				</div>
					<div>
					<p>Yes, but the older a product is, the harder it may be to find information about it. If you have a specific question about a product, we’re happy to help you out if we can. But 70 years is a long time, so we can’t promise anything. While you’re waiting for our response you can always browse through the catalogues – the product texts that are there are quite detailed. You can search in the catalogues by product name and product type. There are also various stories about different products on our site, and more are constantly being added.<br>

				</div>
					<div>
					<p>IKEA was founded in the 1940s, so why are you showing no catalogues from before 1951?<br>
The first catalogue did not come out until 1951. Before that, IKEA was a mail order company that didn’t sell furniture, but pens, clocks, electric razors, wallets and bags. At that time, the range was only presented in a small mail order brochure called ikéa-nytt (literally ikéa news). Sometimes it was distributed as a supplement in farming paper <i>Jordbrukarnas Föreningsblad</i>, which reached hundreds of thousands of people in the Swedish countryside. From autumn 1948 Ingvar Kamprad started including furniture in the range, and things quickly grew from there. In the 1950 ikéa-nytt, as many as six of the 18 pages featured furniture. And when you look at the 1951 catalogue, you’ll see that there are no more pens and wallets. Ingvar Kamprad was now truly focusing on home furnishing, and shelving the rest.<br>
<a href="https://ikeamuseum.com/en/explore/the-story-of-ikea/ikea-news/">Browse through all issues of ikéa-nytt</a>.</p>
				</div>
					<div>
					<p>Not really. We do have a few copies of each year’s IKEA catalogue in our archives, which we’re saving for posterity. They should be handled as little as possible to keep them in good condition, so we’ve made the catalogues available digitally, both online and on monitors at IKEA Museum. You can browse through those as much as you like!</p>
				</div>
					<div>
					<p>Yes you can. The easiest way to share the catalogues is to click on the arrow at the bottom left corner for each catalogue, or in the left-hand menu once you’ve started browsing through. This will copy a link which you can share on a website or social media. If you would like to download and publish on your own digital platform, you can share a maximum of three complete digital catalogues. Don’t forget to state the copyright details, “© Inter IKEA Systems B.V.”, the catalogue year, and the link <a href="https://ikeamuseum.com/en/explore/ikea-catalogue/">/en/explore/ikea-catalogue/</a> so that anyone interested can find out more. You may not publish the digital catalogues for commercial purposes.</p>
				</div>
					<div>
					<p>Absolutely! You can share up to 30 images from the catalogues on your own digital platform, such as a blog, on Instagram or similar (as long as it’s not for commercial purposes). Don’t forget to state the copyright details, “© Inter IKEA Systems B.V.”, the catalogue year, and the link <a href="https://ikeamuseum.com/en/explore/ikea-catalogue/">/en/explore/ikea-catalogue/</a> so that anyone interested can find out more.</p>
				</div>
					<div>
					<p>Yes! You can find all press material, including images, information about current exhibitions and much more, in the <a href="https://ikeamuseum.com/en/about/press-room/">IKEA Museum press room</a>.</p>
				</div>
					<div>
					<p>At the moment we have a good amount of catalogues in all languages at the museum, and do not need any more. Having said that, please contact us anyway if you’ve been collecting catalogues for several decades, or if you have any other material you think might be of interest to IKEA Museum.</p>
				</div>
					<div>
					<p>Unfortunately not. We sometimes wish we did, as we handle quite a lot of old products that may need putting together and taking apart.</p>

        </div> <p>Other Alpine countries are also seeing glaciers retreat, and researchers highlight that those in Switzerland -- whose mountain peaks are higher than in neighbouring <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/austria/" target="_self">Austria</a> -- may have a better chance of surviving the increasingly hot summers.</p> <p>Even so, scientists warn that Switzerland's glaciers could all but disappear by the end of this century without more action to rein in global warming.</p> <p>"We can't avoid the glacier melting overall," GLAMOS head Huss said, but "we can slow it down... with globally coordinated climate action".</p> <p>If carbon dioxide emissions "are brought to zero within 30 years... we could still save about one-third of the Swiss glaciers", Huss added.</p> <p>Since the early 1970s, more than 1,100 Swiss glaciers have disappeared completely, according to GLAMOS.</p> <h2>'Destabilising' mountains</h2> <p>Overlooking the Rhone Glacier, near Gletsch village, Huss said the giant ice mass had lost more than 100 metres (330 feet) in height in the last 20 years.</p> <p>"It's really a devastation of the ice," he said.</p> <p>Argentine tourist Wincho Ponte, 29, agreed.</p> <p>It was "really sad that it's melting so quickly", Pointe said.</p> <p>Water reserves have meanwhile been dwindling as the glaciers retreat, causing increasing problems in the summer months.</p> <p>Huss cautioned that this could hit "water availability not only up here in the mountains but also all the way down to the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/mediterranean-sea/" target="_self">Mediterranean Sea</a>".</p>

        </div> <p>"The continuous diminishing of glaciers also contributes to the destabilising of mountains", he warned, pointing to the Swiss village of Blatten, which was wiped out by a dramatic glacier collapse in May.</p> <p>GLAMOS determined that Swiss glacier volume will total 45.1 cubic kilometres (10.8 cubic miles) at the end of this year -- or 30 km3 less than in 2000.</p> <p>At present, the surface area of Swiss glaciers covers 755 square kilometres -- a decline of 30 percent over the past 25 years.</p> <p>This year, Switzerland's second-hottest June on record contributed to snow melting rapidly, even at the highest altitudes.</p> <p>August brought a fresh <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/heatwave/" target="_self">heatwave</a>, pushing the freezing line as high as 5,000 metres above sea level -- well above the peak of western Europe's highest mountain, Mont Blanc.</p> <p>Only a rather cool and damp July "provided some relief and prevented an even worse outcome", GLAMOS said, with a few cold fronts resulting in individual days with fresh snow at higher altitudes.</p> <p>The overall summer melt this year was therefore only 15 percent above the 2010-2020 average -- its lowest level in the past four years.</p> <p><em>(FRANCE 24 with AFP)</em></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/07/windows_11_local_account_loophole/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/07/windows_11_local_account_loophole/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45503726">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Microsoft is closing a popular loophole that allowed users to install Windows 11 without a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>The change has appeared in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/10/06/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26220-6772-dev-channel/">recent Insider builds</a> of Windows 11, indicating it is likely to be included in the production version soon.</p>
<p>Microsoft refers to these loopholes as "known mechanisms" and is talking about local commands in this instance. You can learn all about these in our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/05/set_up_windows11_local_account/">piece</a> for getting Windows 11 installed with a local account, but suffice to say <code>start ms-cxh:localonly</code> is no more.</p>

    

<p>"While these mechanisms were often used to bypass Microsoft account setup, they also inadvertently skip critical setup screens, potentially causing users to exit OOBE with a device that is not fully configured for use," Microsoft said.</p>

        


        

<p>"Users will need to complete OOBE with internet and a Microsoft account, to ensure [the] device is set up correctly."</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/01/hundreds_businesses_urge_microsoft_not_end_win10_support/">Hundreds of orgs urge Microsoft: don't kill off free Windows 10 updates</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/01/windows_11_25h2/">Windows 11 25H2 is mostly 24H2 with bits bolted on or ripped out</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/30/windows_11_healthcare/">Healthcare lags in Windows 11 upgrades – and lives may depend on it</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As far as Redmond is concerned, this is all for the user's own good. It is also important to note that managed devices are not directly affected, just hardware that users want to get running with Windows 11 without having to deal with a Microsoft Account during setup.</p>
<p>The change is part of Microsoft's ongoing game of Whac-A-Mole with users trying to find ways of avoiding its online services. In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/31/windows_11_insiders/">March</a>, it removed the <code>bypassnro.cmd</code> script that allowed users to get through the Windows 11 setup without needing an internet connection. That time, Microsoft said the change was to "enhance security and user experience of Windows 11."</p>
<p>There remain a number of ways to avoid the Microsoft account requirement during setup, including setting up an unattended installation, but these are more complicated. It is also clear that Microsoft is determined to continue closing loopholes where it can.</p>

        

<p>It is getting increasingly difficult to use Windows 11 on an unmanaged device without a Microsoft account. Users who don't want to sign up should perhaps consider whether it's time to look at an alternative operating system instead. ®</p>

This way, we forced the runtime to execute this Erlang function.</p><p><code>hello:start/2</code> is very simple as it just calls the <code>erlang:halt/2</code>. This function is a <strong>BIF</strong> (Built-in Function) that executes C code, part of the BEAM VM. This code executes an ordered shutdown of the BEAM and allows us to customize the error code, in this case: <code>42</code>.</p><p>(Why <code>{flush, false}</code>?

Preloaded modules are Erlang fundamental modules that are always loaded by the BEAM before the first Erlang process can start. They implement, in Erlang, the core features of the Erlang Runtime System (ERTS). The OTP build scripts group all <code>ebin</code> files into a single C header that is then linked into the executable. This makes the Erlang binaries available as a static C array in the BEAM source code. These are then loaded one by one after the BEAM VM is initialized.</p><p>Cool, let's nuke all these modules and leave just our <code>hello.erl</code>. It does not need many BEAM instructions and we can easily verify that it executes. To do the substitution we just need to change this build variable in <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/fa61ec65e57cfdf96b70514800f7021b83cc7fdc#diff-ffe95702266c55f8aeab7d07a0898c9548fbb390b238145f0abe05399baab62aL749-R749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">otp/erts/emulator/Makefile.in</a></p><p>We are running BEAMASM with <code>-JDdump true</code> so <code>asmjit</code> will dump all ARM32 assembly for each module! This is incredibly useful if monitored while executing with a debugger, as we can see the assembler being printed line by line by our code.</p><div><p><span>shell</span></p><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>~</span><span>/arm32-jit$ cat hello.asm </span></span>

<span><span>; </span><span>CODE_SIZE:</span><span> 632</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Bear in mind, this assembler is not what hello should look like. We are missing a lot of things.</p><p>You can spot many sequences like:</p><div><p><span>asm</span></p><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>    movw r0, </span><span>64676</span></span>
<span><span>    movt r0, </span><span>16480</span></span>
<span><span>    blx L22</span><span> # &lt;---- branch to NYI</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is a call to <code>nyi</code> (Not Yet Implemented) function and the argument loaded to R0 is the pointer to a string that contains the name of the BEAM instruction that should have been emitted instead. You can spot many of these since we are only emitting the code to reach halt. Everything after that is not important now as halt will never return!</p><p>There are many more comments we could make around all the details in this assembler dump, but let's move on.</p><h3 id="jumping-into-jitted-code" tabindex="-1">Jumping into Jitted code! <a href="#jumping-into-jitted-code" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Jumping into Jitted code!&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Later in the BEAM initialization the first Erlang process will be allocated and started.</p><p>We swap the module and function with hello in <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/fa61ec65e57cfdf96b70514800f7021b83cc7fdc#diff-3517781afd08bfe826dcc3babdfa35cdabb9d13011d5dd9ae49922f3996cadb5L395" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">erts/emulator/beam/erl_init.c</a></p><div><p><span>cpp</span></p><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>    erl_spawn_system_process</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>parent, am_hello, am_start, args, </span><span>&amp;</span><span>so);</span></span></code></pre></div><p>One BEAM scheduler thread will jump to the <code>process_main</code> function. You can find it <a href="https://github.com/stritzinger/otp/blob/31edb99e9851e9d35b0cf6a3f4ead9a4cc4cfcb6/erts/emulator/beam/jit/arm/32/process_main.cpp#L49" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> in the source code. This is emitted by our JIT and is the first emitted code that will run.</p><p>Here we need to handle the Erlang processes scheduling by calling BEAM routines that implement the algorithms of Erlang concurrency, like <a href="https://github.com/stritzinger/otp/blob/eda80cd2fe028c2db6f67bcf97ac50de85c41b2f/erts/emulator/beam/erl_process.c#L9465" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>erts_schedule</code></a>.</p><p><code>erts_schedule</code> will return the pointer to the <code>Process</code> C structure that holds all information about the process that is going to execute. We then load all necessary data inside registers and then we branch to the exact point where the program execution stopped.</p><h3 id="the-first-erlang-function-call" tabindex="-1">The first Erlang function call <a href="#the-first-erlang-function-call" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The first Erlang function call&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In this case we are calling <code>hello:start/2</code> so the first instruction to execute is <code>apply_only</code> that does a few things but ends up calling the C <code>apply</code> routine.</p><p>The routine processes the Module-Function-Arity information to get the address where the function code resides in memory.</p><p>What follows is the Erlang function prologue. You can see it in the assembler code section above. For example, all functions have these instructions in their prologue:</p><ul><li>i_breakpoint_trampoline: handle breakpoints for the <code>debugger</code> app</li><li>i_test_yield: checks if the function should yield and go back to the scheduler</li></ul><p>We have minimal or partial implementations of these since we do not really need them. We have to emit them though, as the C++ generated loader functions from the BEAM are expanding the Erlang function call Operation into a more specific and complex function prologue sequence.</p><p>After that, we added support for the <a href="https://github.com/stritzinger/otp/blob/31edb99e9851e9d35b0cf6a3f4ead9a4cc4cfcb6/erts/emulator/beam/jit/arm/32/instr_bif.cpp#L280" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>call_light_bif</code></a> operation that precedes the call to the halt_2 BIF routine. This implementation is also minimal.</p><p><em>Question for later: did you notice that we put a <code>42</code> as a number in the code? Numeric constants are printed as decimals in the dump, but we cannot spot any 42!?</em></p><p>After the call, we see two other operations:</p><ul><li>dealloc</li><li>return</li></ul><p>These are just calls to NYI as we will never reach this code! So for now, we can skip them...</p><h3 id="let-s-roll-the-jit" tabindex="-1">Let's roll the JIT! <a href="#let-s-roll-the-jit" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Let's roll the JIT!&quot;">​</a></h3><div><p><span>shell</span></p><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>    ~/arm32-jit$</span><span> qemu-arm</span><span> -L</span><span> /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf</span><span> ./otp/RELEASE/erts-15.0/bin/beam.smp</span><span> -S</span><span> 1:1</span><span> -SDcpu</span><span> 1:1</span><span> -SDio</span><span> 1</span><span> -JDdump</span><span> true</span><span> -JMsingle</span><span>     true</span><span> --</span><span> -root</span><span> /home/arm32-jit/otp/RELEASE</span><span> -progname</span><span> erl</span><span> -home</span><span> /home</span></span>

This is a great achievement as from now on we will be able to incrementally add Erlang instructions.</p><p>Every Erlang line we add will trigger new Opcodes. By emitting them and running the code we will have immediate feedback on everything.</p><p>The next goal now is to complete the <code>hello</code> module to host all possible beam instructions!</p><h4 id="hey-where-is-42" tabindex="-1">Hey where is 42??? <a href="#hey-where-is-42" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Hey where is 42???&quot;">​</a></h4><p>One interesting thing I spotted looking at the assembly: You cannot find the number <code>42</code> in there. Or actually, you can, it is just hidden in plain sight. To understand you need to know how we are using ARM32 registers.</p><p>In particular the register <code>r4</code>, a callee-saved register. We are using it to store the pointer to the <code>ErtsSchedulerRegisters</code> struct. The <code>ErtsSchedulerRegisters</code> contains the X register array. When a function is called, X registers are used to store the arguments of the call.</p><p>This becomes more obvious if we compare the Erlang assembly to the Arm32 assembly.</p><div><p><span>asm</span></p><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span># i_move_sd                       &lt;---- {move,{literal,[{flush,false}]},{x,1}}. % List at X[1]</span></span>

<p dir="auto">You will need a fresh Ubuntu/Debian server you can SSH into with sudo privileges. We recommend a CPX31 from <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/" rel="nofollow">Hetzner</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can use the provisioning script to get a server up and running:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Sign in or sign up for a Hetzner account</strong>: <a href="https://console.hetzner.cloud/" rel="nofollow">Hetzner Cloud Console</a></li>
<li><strong>Generate an API token</strong>: <a href="https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token/" rel="nofollow">Creating an API token</a></li>
<li><strong>Provision a server</strong> (requires <code>--token</code>; optional: <code>--user</code>, <code>--name</code>, <code>--region</code>, <code>--type</code>):
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hunvreus/devpush/main/scripts/prod/provision-hetzner.sh | bash -s -- --token <hetzner_api_key> [--user <login_user>] [--name <hostname>] [--region <fsn1|nbg1|hel1|ash|hil|sin>] [--type <cpx11|cpx21|cpx31|cpx41|cpx51>]"><pre>curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hunvreus/devpush/main/scripts/prod/provision-hetzner.sh <span>|</span> bash -s -- --token <span>&lt;</span>hetzner_api_key<span>&gt;</span> [--user <span>&lt;</span>login_user<span>&gt;</span>] [--name <span>&lt;</span>hostname<span>&gt;</span>] [--region <span>&lt;</span>fsn1<span>|</span>nbg1<span>|</span>hel1<span>|</span>ash<span>|</span>hil<span>|</span>sin<span>&gt;</span>] [--type <span>&lt;</span>cpx11<span>|</span>cpx21<span>|</span>cpx31<span>|</span>cpx41<span>|</span>cpx<span>51&gt;</span>]</pre></div>
Tip: run <code>curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hunvreus/devpush/main/scripts/prod/provision-hetzner.sh | bash -s -- --help</code> to list regions and types (with specs). Defaults: region <code>hil</code>, type <code>cpx31</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Configure DNS Records</strong>: Go to your DNS provider and create two A records pointing at the server IP for <code>APP_HOSTNAME</code> (e.g. <code>app.devpu.sh</code>) and a wildcard on subdomains of <code>DEPLOY_DOMAIN</code> (e.g. <code>*.devpush.app</code>). If you're using Cloudflare, set SSL/TLS to "Full (strict)" and keep the records proxied.</li>
<li><strong>SSH into your new server</strong>: The provision script will have created a user for you.
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="ssh <login_user>@<server_ip>"><pre>ssh <span>&lt;</span>login_user<span>&gt;</span>@<span>&lt;</span>server_ip<span>&gt;</span></pre></div>

																														<h2>Quantum properties on a human scale</h2>
																														<p>The Nobel Prize laureates in physics for 2025, <strong>John Clarke</strong>, <strong>Michel H. Devoret</strong> and <strong>John M. Martinis</strong>, used a series of experiments to demonstrate that the bizarre properties of the quantum world can be made concrete in a system big enough to be held in the hand. Their superconducting electrical system could tunnel from one state to another, as if it were passing straight through a wall. They also showed that the system absorbed and emitted energy in doses of specific sizes, just as predicted by quantum mechanics.</p>
																														<h3>A series of groundbreaking experiments</h3>

																														<p>Quantum mechanics describes properties that are significant on a scale that involves single particles. In quantum physics, these phenomena are called <em>microscopic</em>, even when they are much smaller than can be seen using an optical microscope. This contrasts with <em>macroscopic</em> phenom­ena, which consist of a large number of particles. For example, an everyday ball is built up of an astronomical amount of molecules and displays no quantum mechanical effects. We know that the ball will bounce back every time it is thrown at a wall. A single particle, however, will sometimes pass straight through an equivalent barrier in its microscopic world and appear on the other side. This quantum mechanical phenomenon is called <em>tunnelling</em>.</p>
																														<p>This year’s Nobel Prize in Physics recognises experiments that demonstrated how quantum tunnelling can be observed on a macroscopic scale, involving many particles. In 1984 and 1985, John Clarke, Michel Devoret and John Martinis conducted a series of experiments at the University of California, Berkeley. They built an electrical circuit with two superconductors, components that can conduct a current without any electrical resistance. They separated these with a thin layer of material that did not conduct any current at all. In this experiment, they showed that they could control and investigate a phenomenon in which all the charged particles in the superconductor behave in unison, as if they are a single particle that fills the entire circuit.</p>

When you throw a ball at a wall, you can be sure it will bounce back at you. You would be extremely surprised if the ball suddenly appeared on the other side of a solid wall. This is exactly the type of phenomenon that has given quantum physics a reputation for being bizarre and unintuitive.&nbsp;<span>©Johan Jarnestad/The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</span></figcaption></figure>
																														<p>This particle-like system is trapped in a state in which current flows without any voltage – a state from which it does not have enough energy to escape. In the experiment, the system shows its quantum character by using tunnelling to escape the zero-voltage state, generating an electrical voltage. The laureates were also able to show that the system is quantised, which means it only absorbs or emits energy in specific amounts.</p>
																														<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="568" src="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2025/10/popular-physicsprize2025-figure3-1024x568.jpg" alt="Illustration"><figcaption>Figure 3. Initially, the experiment has no voltage at all. It is as if there is a lever in the off position, and something is blocking from being moved to on. Without the effects of quantum mechanics, this state would remain unchanged. Suddenly, a voltage appears. This is as if the lever has moved from off to on, despite the barrier between the two. What happened in the experiment is called macroscopic quantum tunnelling.&nbsp;<span>©Johan Jarnestad/The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</span></figcaption></figure>
																														<h3>Tunnels and crossings</h3>
																														<p>To help them, the laureates had concepts and experimental tools that had been developed over decades. Together with the theory of relativity, quantum physics is the foundation of what has come to be called modern physics, and researchers have spent the last century exploring what it entails.</p>
																														<p>Individual particles’ ability to tunnel is well known. In 1928, the physicist George Gamow realised that tunnelling is the reason why some heavy atomic nuclei tend to decay in a particular manner. The interaction between the forces in the nucleus creates a barrier around it, holding in the particles it contains. However, despite this, a small piece of the atomic nucleus can sometimes split off, move outside the barrier and escape – leaving behind a nucleus that has been transformed into another element. Without tunnelling, this type of nuclear decay could not occur.</p>
																														<p>Tunnelling is a quantum mechanical process, which entails that chance plays a role. Some types of atomic nuclei have a tall, wide barrier, so it can take a long while for a piece of the nucleus to appear outside it, while other types decay more easily. If we only look at a single atom, we cannot predict when this will happen, but by watching the decay of a large number of nuclei of the same type, we can measure an expected time before tunnelling occurs. The most common way of describing this is through the concept of half-life, which is how long it takes for half the nuclei in a sample to decay.</p>
																														<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="276" src="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2025/10/popular-physicsprize2025-figure4-1024x276.jpg" alt="Illustration"><figcaption>Figure 4. Physicists have known for almost a century that tunnelling is necessary for a particular type of nuclear decay (alpha decay). A tiny piece of the atom’s nucleus breaks free and appears outside it.&nbsp;<span>©Johan Jarnestad/The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</span></figcaption></figure>
																														<p>Physicists were quick to wonder whether it would be possible to investigate a type of tunnelling that involves more than one particle at a time. One approach to new types of experiments originated in a phenomenon that arises when some materials get extremely cold.</p>
																														<p>In an ordinary conductive material, current flows because there are electrons that are free to move through the entire material. In some materials, the individual electrons that push their way through the conductor may become organised, forming a synchronised dance that flows without any resistance. The material has become a superconductor and the electrons are joined together as pairs. These are called Cooper pairs, after <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1972/cooper/facts/">Leon Cooper</a> who, along with <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1956/bardeen/facts/">John Bardeen</a> and <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1972/schrieffer/facts/">Robert Schrieffer</a>, provided a detailed description of how superconductors work (<a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1972/summary/">Nobel Prize in Physics 1972</a>).</p>
																														<p>Cooper pairs behave completely differently to ordinary electrons. Electrons have a great deal of integrity and like to stay at a distance from each other – two electrons cannot be in the same place if they have the same properties. We can see this in an atom, for example, where the electrons divide themselves into different energy levels, called shells. However, when the electrons in a superconductor join up as pairs, they lose a bit of their individuality; while two separate electrons are always distinct, two Cooper pairs can be exactly the same. This means the Cooper pairs in a superconductor can be described as a single unit, one quantum mechanical system. In the language of quantum mechanics, they are then described as a single <em>wave function</em>. This wave function describes the probability of observing the system in a given state and with given properties.</p>
																														<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="697" src="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2025/10/popular-physicsprize2025-figure5-1024x697.jpg" alt="Illustration"><figcaption>Figure 5. In a normal conductor, the electrons jostle with each other and with the material. When a material becomes a superconductor, the electrons join up as pairs, Cooper pairs, and form a current where there is no resistance. The gap in the illustration marks the Josephson junction. Cooper pairs can behave as if they were all a single particle that fills the entire electrical circuit. Quantum mechanics describes this collective state using a shared wave function. The properties of this wave function play the leading role in the laureates’ experiment.&nbsp;<span>©Johan Jarnestad/The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</span></figcaption></figure>
																														<p>If two superconductors are joined together with a thin insulating barrier between them, it creates a Josephson junction. This component is named after <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1973/josephson/facts/">Brian Josephson</a>, who performed quantum mechanical calculations for the junction. He discovered that interesting phenomena arise when the wave functions on each side of the junction are considered (<a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1973/summary/">Nobel Prize in Physics 1973</a>). The Josephson junction rapidly found areas of application, including in precise measurements of fundamental physical constants and magnetic fields.</p>
																														<p>The construction also provided tools for exploring the fundamentals of quantum physics in a new way. One person who did so was <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2003/leggett/facts/">Anthony Leggett</a> (<a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2003/summary/">Nobel Prize in Physics 2003</a>), whose theoretical work on macroscopic quantum tunnelling at a Josephson junction inspired new types of experiments.</p>
																														<h3>The research group starts its work</h3>
																														<p>These subjects were a perfect match for John Clarke’s research interests. He was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in the US, where he had moved after completing his doctoral degree at the University of Cambridge, UK, in 1968. At UC Berkeley he built up his research group and specialised in exploring a range of phenomena using superconductors and the Josephson junction.</p>
																														<p>By the mid-1980s, Michel Devoret had joined John Clarke’s research group as a postdoc, after receiving his doctorate in Paris. This group also included the doctoral student John Martinis. Together, they took on the challenge of demonstrating macroscopic quantum tunnelling. Vast amounts of care and precision were necessary to screen the experimental setup from all the interference that could affect it. They succeeded in refining and measuring all the properties of their electrical circuit, allowing them to understand it in detail.</p>
																														<p>To measure the quantum phenomena, they fed a weak current into the Josephson junction and measured the voltage, which is related to the electrical resistance in the circuit. The voltage over the Josephson junction was initially zero, as expected. This is because the wave function for the system is enclosed in a state that does not allow a voltage to arise. Then they studied how long it took for the system to tunnel out of this state, causing a voltage. Because quantum mechanics entails an element of chance, they took numerous measurements and plotted their results as graphs, from which they could read the duration of the zero-voltage state. This is similar to how measurements of the half-lives of atomic nuclei are based on statistics of numerous instances of decay.</p>
																														<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="351" src="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2025/10/popular-physicsprize2025-figure6-1024x351.jpg" alt="Illustration"><figcaption>Figure 6. John Clarke, Michel Devoret and John Martinis constructed an experiment using a superconducting electrical circuit. The chip that held this circuit was about a centimetre in size. Previously, tunnelling and energy quantisation had been studied in systems that had just a few particles; here, these phenomena appeared in a quantum mechanical system with billions of Cooper pairs that filled the entire superconductor on the chip. In this way, the experiment took quantum mechanical effects from a microscopic scale to a macroscopic one.&nbsp;<span>©Johan Jarnestad/The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</span></figcaption></figure>
																														<p>The tunnelling demonstrates how the experimental setup’s Cooper pairs, in their synchronised dance, behave like a single giant particle. The researchers obtained further confirmation of this when they saw that the system had quantised energy levels. Quantum mechanics was named after the observation that the energy in microscopic processes is divided into separate packages, quanta. The laureates introduced microwaves of varying wavelengths into the zero-voltage state. Some of these were absorbed, and the system then moved to a higher energy level. This showed that the zero-voltage state had a shorter duration when the system contained more energy – which is exactly what quantum mechanics predicts. A microscopic particle shut behind a barrier functions in the same way.</p>
																														<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="446" src="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2025/10/popular-physicsprize2025-figure7-1024x446.jpg" alt="Illustration"><figcaption>Figure 7. A quantum mechanical system behind a barrier can have varying amounts of energy, but it can only absorb or emit specific amounts of this energy. The system is quantised. Tunnelling occurs more easily at a higher energy level than at a lower one so, statistically, a system with more energy is held captive for less time than one with less energy.&nbsp;<span>©Johan Jarnestad/The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</span></figcaption></figure>
																														<h3>Practical and theoretical benefit</h3>
																														<p>This experiment has consequences for the understanding of quantum mechanics. Other types of quantum mechanical effects that are demonstrated on the macroscopic scale are composed of many tiny individual pieces and their separate quantum properties. The microscopic components are then combined to cause macroscopic phenomena such as lasers, superconductors and superfluid liquids. However, this experiment instead created a macroscopic effect – a measurable voltage – from a state that is in itself macroscopic, in the form of a common wave function for vast numbers of particles.</p>
																														<p>Theorists like Anthony Leggett have compared the laureates’ macroscopic quantum system with <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1933/schrodinger/facts/">Erwin Schrödinger</a>’s famous thought experiment featuring a cat in a box, where the cat would be both alive and dead if we did not look inside. (Erwin Schrödinger received the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1933/summary/">Nobel Prize in Physics 1933</a>.) The intention of his thought experiment was to show the absurdity of this situation, because the special properties of quantum mechanics are often erased at a macroscopic scale. The quantum properties of an entire cat cannot be demonstrated in a laboratory experiment.</p>
																														<p>However, Legget has argued that the series of experiments conducted by John Clarke, Michel Devoret and John Martinis showed that there are phenomena that involve vast numbers of particles which together behave just as quantum mechanics predicts. The macroscopic system that consists of many Cooper pairs is still many orders of magnitude smaller than a kitten – but because the experiment measures the quantum mechanical properties that apply to the system as a whole, for a quantum physicist it is fairly similar to Schrödinger’s imaginary cat.</p>
																														<p>This type of macroscopic quantum state offers new potential for experiments using the phenomena that govern the microscopic world of particles. It can be regarded as a form of artificial atom on a large scale – an atom with cables and sockets that can be connected into new test set-ups or utilised in new quantum technology. For example, artificial atoms are used to simulate other quantum systems and aid in understanding them.</p>
																														<p>Another example is the quantum computer experiment subsequently performed by Martinis, in which he utilised exactly the energy quantisation that he and the other two laureates had demon­strated. He used a circuit with quantised states as information-bearing units – a quantum bit. The lowest energy state and the first step upward functioned as zero and one, respectively. Superconducting circuits are one of the techniques being explored in attempts to construct a future quantum computer.</p>
																														<p>This year’s laureates have thus contributed to both practical benefit in physics laboratories and to providing new information for the theoretical understanding of our physical world.</p>

                        <p>Ford’s CEO recently said that there is a shortage of mechanics in the US. A mechanic says he knows exactly why it’s hard to find good help these days—and that car companies themselves may be to blame.</p>
<p>Wiktor Ivanovko posted a video to his <em>Facebook</em> page. It starts with a clip of comments made by Ford CEO Jim Farley to <em>Yahoo Finance</em> about how a lack of skilled mechanics is impacting the auto industry.</p>
<p>"This morning when I woke up, there were 6,000 bays in our dealerships," Farley says in the clip.</p>
<p><em>Yahoo Finance</em> editor Brian Sozzi asks, "Why is there a shortage of these workers?"</p>
<p>"Well, it’s a complicated problem, but—" Farley says as the video cuts out.</p>
<h2><span><svg><use xlink:href=""></use></svg></span>Response to Ford CEO's Skilled Workers Comments</h2>
<p>Clearly, Ivanovko thinks he’s got an idea why Ford is struggling to hire skilled mechanics. And it doesn’t have to do with lack of trained workers. It’s all about engineering and flat-rate pay for repairs under warranty.</p>
<p>“You’ll have to do this oil pan gasket on this F-250,” Ivanovko says, mimicking a <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/774640/performance-sports-car-sales-q3-2025/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22774640%22%2C%22section%22%3A%221%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22performance-sports-car-sales-q3-2025%22%7D">Ford</a> dealership manager. “You’ll have to pull the cab off of the frame to do it. And it’s under warranty, so it pays like .6 [hours]. Why don’t you want to work for me?”</p><div contenteditable="false" draggable="true">

			<p>Our team of experts tracks what's trending so you don't have to—from viral videos to online debates that have everyone talking.</p>
		</div>
<div contenteditable="false" draggable="true" data-widget="video"><p><img draggable="false" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAYAAAA7KqwyAAAAGXRFWHRTb2Z0d2FyZQBBZG9iZSBJbWFnZVJlYWR5ccllPAAAABpJREFUeNpi/P//PwMlgImBQjBqwLAwACDAAOVfAw9/ZDvcAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC" alt=""></p><p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/daC2V2NHAuI?autoplay=1&amp;mute=1&amp;si=WxWdXJaVsLWV1bsl" title="YouTube video player" width="560" loading="lazy"> </iframe></p> </div>
<p>Estimates vary, but online consensus is that it will take at least a few hours to remove the cab of a truck, and upwards of an entire day. But if the warranty pays a flat rate of just 40 minutes for a repair that requires removing the cab first, the mechanic is essentially losing time and money.</p>
<p>Many self-identified mechanics who commented on Ivanovko’s post blamed the engineers who design vehicles for making them difficult to work on.</p>
<p>“Engineers should design them to be worked on. Not to speed up the assembly process,” wrote one.</p>
<h2><span><svg><use xlink:href=""></use></svg></span>Why Is Ford Struggling to Hire Skilled Mechanics?</h2>
<p>While Ford has 6,000 open positions, Farley estimated that the overall economy needs another 400,000 mechanic technicians. He blamed the gap on decreased productivity over the past 20 years, the lack of glamour associated with the position, and excessive regulation.</p>
<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/insurance-services/car-warranty/auto-tech-shortage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MarketWatch</a></em>, the automotive industry is indeed short nearly half a million mechanics. While Farley focused on public perception of working people as a primary driver of this shortage, analysts attributed it to a lack of mechanics graduating from school, a wave of retirements by older generations of mechanics, and the fact that new vehicles generally last longer than older ones.</p>
<p>Mechanics on a <em>Reddit</em> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoMechanics/comments/1in1sdk/theres_a_mechanic_shortage_according_to_fox_news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thread</a> posted to r/AutoMechanics earlier this year note the study and dedication needed to learn the trade, the long hours, and the physical aspect of the job. Add to that the fact that it’s <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/rising-car-repair-costs-squeeze-drivers-and-small-shops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more expensive</a> than ever to run an auto body shop, and you’ve got a recipe for a shortage.</p>
<p>However, there are signs this trend might be reversing, including an <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jul/3/trade-school-enrollments-boom-as-high-school-grads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased number</a> of mechanic graduates entering the job market.</p>
<h2><span><svg><use xlink:href=""></use></svg></span>Viewers React to Ivanovko’s Ford Response</h2>
<p>In the comments, viewers reacted to Ivanovko’s retort to the Ford CEO. Many said his criticism is justified.</p>
<p>“Always been a strong believer that if you want to be an engineer, you should have to work in the trade for no less than two years,” wrote one viewer. “So they understand what it takes.”</p>
<p>“And you have to buy all of your own tools to do it,” agreed a second viewer.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Deloitte will provide a partial refund to the federal government over a $440,000 report that contained several errors, after admitting it used generative artificial intelligence to help produce it.</p><p>The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) confirmed Deloitte would repay the final instalment under its contract, which will be made public after the transaction is finalised. It comes as one Labor senator accused the consultancy firm of having a “human intelligence problem”.</p><p>Deloitte was commissioned by the department to review the targeted compliance framework and its IT system, used to automate penalties in the welfare system if <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/16/centrelink-mutual-obligations-budget-changes-jobseeker-suspensions" data-link-name="in body link">mutual obligations</a> weren’t met by jobseekers, in December 2024.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton" data-link-name="in body link"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p><p>The subsequent report found widespread issues, including a lack of “traceability” between the rules of the framework and the legislation behind it, as well as “system defects”. It said an IT system was “driven by punitive assumptions of participant non-compliance”.</p><p>It was first published on 4 July. It was re-uploaded to the DEWR website on Friday, after the <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/professional-services/academics-raise-alarm-over-suspected-ai-use-in-deloitte-report-20250822-p5mp0f" data-link-name="in body link">Australian Financial Review</a> in August reported that multiple errors had been found, including nonexistent references and citations.</p><figure id="6d2d999f-8ada-4138-b34e-710e6806c7f3" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:6,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Labor asks Deloitte to design universal childcare system as PM eyes political legacy&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;6d2d999f-8ada-4138-b34e-710e6806c7f3&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/11/labor-asks-deloitte-to-design-universal-childcare-system-as-pm-eyes-political-legacy&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>University of Sydney academic, Dr Christopher Rudge, who first highlighted the errors, said the report contained “hallucinations” where AI models may fill in gaps, misinterpret data, or try to guess answers.</p><p>“Instead of just substituting one hallucinated fake reference for a new ‘real’ reference, they’ve substituted the fake hallucinated references and in the new version, there’s like five, six or seven or eight in their place,” he said.</p><p>“So what that suggests is that the original claim made in the body of the report wasn’t based on any one particular evidentiary source.”</p><p>The updated review noted a “small number of corrections to references and footnotes”, but the department has said there have been no changes to the review’s recommendations.</p><p>“Deloitte conducted the independent assurance review and has confirmed some footnotes and references were incorrect,” a spokesperson for the department said.</p><p>“The substance of the independent review is retained, and there are no changes to the recommendations.”</p><p>In the updated version of the report, Deloitte added reference to the use of generative AI in its appendix. It states that a part of the report “included the use of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) large language model (Azure OpenAI GPT – 4o) based tool chain licensed by DEWR and hosted on DEWR’s Azure tenancy.”</p><p>Deloitte did not state that artificial intelligence was the reason behind the errors in its original report. It also stood by the original findings of the review.</p><p>“The updates made in no way impact or affect the substantive content, findings and recommendations in the report,” it stated in the amended version.</p><p>A spokesperson for Deloitte said “the matter has been resolved directly with the client”.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-17">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-17" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Rudge said that, despite his criticism, he hesitates to say the whole report should be “regarded as illegitimate”, because the conclusions concur with other widespread evidence.</p><p>Labor senator Deborah O’Neill, who was on a senate inquiry into the integrity of consulting firms, said it looked like “AI is being left to do the heavy lifting”.</p><p>“Deloitte has a human intelligence problem. This would be laughable if it wasn’t so lamentable. A partial refund looks like a partial apology for substandard work,” she said.</p><p>“Anyone looking to contract these firms should be asking exactly who is doing the work they are paying for, and having that expertise and no AI use verified.</p><p>“Perhaps instead of a big consulting firm, procurers would be better off signing up for a ChatGPT subscription.”</p><p>The <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/professional-services/deloitte-to-refund-government-after-admitting-ai-errors-in-440k-report-20251005-p5n05p" data-link-name="in body link">AFR found several incorrect references</a> in the original report, including nonexistent reports by professors at the University of Sydney and the Lund University in Sweden.</p><p>The paper also reported a made-up reference to a court decision in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/centrelink-debt-recovery" data-link-name="in body link">robodebt</a> case, Deanna Amato v Commonwealth.
