<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    
    <p><em>We like to write software!</em> Coding is a zigzag journey of problem-solving,
    and the destination is less important than some might think.</p>
    <p>We often get asked questions like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Why are you doing this?”</li>
      <li>“What is the purpose of this project?”</li>
      <li>“What does this project do better than <strong>X</strong>?”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Silicon Valley Cutthroat</h2>
    <p>If one spends a lot of time on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, or other
    startup-oriented news sites, they might believe that everyone is working on their next
    multi-million-dollar startup and/or exit strategy. It may be hard to imagine that people work
    on open source code purely for the fun of it.</p>
    <p><strong>There are hackers</strong> who just love <em>the art of building software</em>.
    They do it for the challenge, for the fun of it. They aren’t trying to make a million dollars.</p>

    <h2>Consumer Culture</h2>
    <p>Or, if one is used to <em>consuming</em> other software only, and rarely
    creating any, they might get stuck in a mindset of thinking “what can this project do for me?”
    (And if the project isn’t relevant to them, they wonder why it exists.)</p>
    <p><strong>There are hackers</strong> who don’t need lots of people to consume their software.
    Of course, they would love it if others enjoyed/admired/appreciated their work, but that's not
    strictly necessary. <em>It's just fun to create.</em></p>

    <h2>We do it just for the fun of it. No, really.</h2>
    <p>Lastly, if one has learned enough programming technique to do their day job and not a lot
    more, then they might not appreciate programmers who are always trying new things.</p>
    <p><strong>There are hackers</strong> who live and breathe code, and the idea that every line
    of code must prove its monetary value, that every hour spent toiling away at the keyboard
    must be accounted for, is a damn shame.
    </p><p><em>The process itself, flaws and all, has value</em>—not just the
    final product.</p>
    <p>I'll end with my favorite quote about programming:</p>
    <blockquote>
      The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff.
      He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination.
      Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable
      of realizing grand conceptual structures....
      Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves
      and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself.
    </blockquote>
    <p>—Fred Brooks, <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em></p>

    <h2>Try it!</h2>
    <p>If you, dear reader, think you may have lost your way—that coding used to be fun
    for you, but now it's just a slog of clocking in and out to get a paycheck,
    then allow us to invite you back!</p>
    <p>Or, if you were conditioned to think that wild-idea programming is only for professionals
    and academics, this page is for you. You have the right to tinker, and have fun doing it!</p>
    <p>Think of something that you might like to build, learn, experience inside the computer,
    and just jump in. Without looking or researching first.
    <em>You might just have a bit of fun. No, really.</em></p>

<p>Harrison.rad.1 excels in the same radiology exams taken by human radiologists, as well as in benchmarks against other foundational models.</p>
<p>The Fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists (FRCR) 2B Rapids exam is considered one of the leading and toughest certifications for radiologists. Only 40-59% of human radiologists pass on their first attempt. Radiologists who re-attempt the exam within a year of passing score an average of 50.88 out of 60 (84.8%)*.</p>
<p>Harrison.rad.1 scored 51.4 out of 60 (85.67%). Other competing models, including OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Microsoft’s LLaVA-Med, Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro, mostly scored below 30**, which is statistically no better than random guessing.</p>

<!-- cache hit 102:single/related:b917326031e9df16b52db9ae66cd04b9 --><!-- empty -->
<p>On Monday, the US Department of Justice's next monopoly trial against Google started in Virginia—this time <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/googles-ad-tech-dominance-spurs-more-antitrust-charges-report-says/">challenging the tech giant's ad tech dominance</a>.</p>
<p>The trial comes after Google lost two major cases that proved <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">Google had a monopoly in both general search</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/googles-android-app-store-monopoly-violates-antitrust-law-jury-finds/">the Android app store</a>. During her opening statement, DOJ lawyer Julia Tarver Wood told US District Judge Leonie Brinkema—who will be ruling on the case after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/google-sends-doj-unexpected-check-in-attempt-to-avoid-monopoly-jury-trial/">Google cut a check to avoid a jury trial</a>—that "it’s worth saying the quiet part out loud," AP News<a href="https://apnews.com/article/google-antitrust-ad-tech-virginia-opening-7a19f525287f782609a5316b1fdb08f0"> reported</a>.</p>
<p>"One monopoly is bad enough," Wood said. "But a trifecta of monopolies is what we have here."</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/US-v-Google-Ad-Tech-Complaint.pdf">complaint</a>, the DOJ argued that Google broke competition in the ad tech space "by engaging in a systematic campaign to seize control of the wide swath of high-tech tools used by publishers, advertisers, and brokers, to facilitate digital advertising."</p>
<p>The result of such "insidious" allegedly anti-competitive behavior is that today Google pockets at least 30 cents "of each advertising dollar flowing from advertisers to website publishers through Google’s ad tech tools ... and sometimes far more," the DOJ alleged.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as Google profits off both advertisers and publishers, "website creators earn less, and advertisers pay more" than "they would in a market where unfettered competitive pressure could discipline prices and lead to more innovative ad tech tools," the DOJ alleged.</p>
<p>On Monday, Wood told Brinkema that Google intentionally put itself in this position to "manipulate the rules of ad auctions to its own benefit," The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/09/google-antitrust-doj-adtech-monopoly/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>“Publishers were understandably furious,” Wood said. “The evidence will show that they could do nothing.”</p>
<p>Wood confirmed that the DOJ planned to call several publishers as witnesses in the coming weeks to explain the harms caused. Expected to take the stand will be "executives from companies including USA Today, [Wall Street] Journal parent company News Corp., and the Daily Mail," the Post reported.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>The ad tech trial, which is expected to last four to six weeks, may be the most consequential of the monopoly trials Google has recently faced, experts have said.</p>
<p>That's because during the DOJ's trial <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">proving Google's monopoly in search</a>, it remained unclear what remedies the DOJ sought. Some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/all-the-possible-ways-to-destroy-googles-monopoly-in-search/">ways to destroy Google's search monopoly</a> could be "unlikely to create meaningful competition" or hurt Google's bottom line, experts told Ars, but a more drastic order to spin out its Chrome browser or Android operating system could really impact Google's revenue. It won't be until December that the DOJ will even provide a rough outline of proposed remedies in that case, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/google-search-monopoly-case-remedies-come-by-december-2024-09-06/">reported</a>, with the judge not expected to rule until next August.</p>
<p>But the DOJ has been very clear about the remedies needed in the ad tech case, "asking Brinkema to order a divestment of Google’s Ad Manager suite of services, which is responsible for many of the rectangular ads that populate the tops and sides of webpages across the Internet," the Post reported.</p>
<p>Because the most "obvious" remedy would be to require Google to sell off parts of its ad business, experts told AP News that the ad tech trial "could potentially be more harmful to Google" than the search trial. Perhaps at the furthest extreme, antitrust expert Shubha Ghosh told Ars that "if this case goes against Google as the last one did, it could set the stage for splitting it into separate search and advertising companies."</p>
<p>In the DOJ's complaint, prosecutors argued that it "is critical to restore competition in these markets by enjoining Google’s anticompetitive practices, unwinding Google’s anticompetitive acquisitions, and imposing a remedy sufficient both to deny Google the fruits of its illegal conduct and to prevent further harm to competition in the future."</p>
<p>Ghosh said that undoing Google's acquisitions could lead to Google no longer representing both advertisers' and sellers' interests in each ad auction—instead requiring Google to either pick a side or perhaps involve a broker.</p>
<p>Although the Post reported that Google has argued that "customers prefer the convenience of a one-stop shop," the DOJ hopes to prove that Google's alleged monopoly has shuttered newspapers across the US and threatens to do more harm if left unchecked.</p>

	<a href="https://variety.com/t/james-earl-jones/" id="auto-tag_james-earl-jones" data-tag="james-earl-jones">James Earl Jones</a>,&nbsp;the prolific film, TV and theater actor whose resonant, unmistakable baritone was most widely known as the voice of “<a href="https://variety.com/t/star-wars/" id="auto-tag_star-wars" data-tag="star-wars">Star Wars</a>” villain <a href="https://variety.com/t/darth-vader/" id="auto-tag_darth-vader" data-tag="darth-vader">Darth Vader</a>, died Monday morning at his home in Dutchess County, N.Y., his rep confirmed to <em>Variety.</em> He was 93.</p>



<p>
	After overcoming a profound stutter as a child, Jones established himself as one of the pioneering Black actors of his generation, amassing a bountiful and versatile career spanning over 60 years, from his debut on Broadway in 1958 at the Cort Theatre — renamed the James Earl Jones Theatre in 2022 —&nbsp;to his most recent performance in 2021’s “Coming 2 America.” For that film, Jones reprised his role as King Jaffe Joffer from the 1988 Eddie Murphy comedy “Coming to America” — one of several roles, along with Darth Vader, that Jones revisited, including the voice of King Mufasa in Disney’s animated feature “The Lion King” in 1994, the 1998 direct-to-video sequel and the 2019 remake,&nbsp;and CIA deputy director Vice Admiral James Greer in three Jack Ryan movies, 1990’s “The Hunt for Red October,” 1992’s “Patriot Games” and 1994’s “Clear and Present Danger.”&nbsp;

<p>
	Among his more than 80 film credits, Jones’ other notable movies include as a B-52 bombardier in Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 Cold War satire “Dr. Strangelove” (his feature film debut), as the first Black president of the United States in 1972’s “The Man,” as the fearsome villain in 1982’s “Conan the Barbarian,” as a reclusive author in 1989’s “Field of Dreams,” as a blind former baseball star in 1993’s “The Sandlot,” and as a minister living in apartheid South Africa in 1995’s “Cry, the Beloved Country.”</p>



<p>
	Jones was nominated for four Tony Awards, and won two, in 1969 for playing boxer Jack Johnson in “The Great White Hope” (which he reprised on film in 1970, receiving his only Oscar nomination), and in 1987 for originating the role of Troy Maxson in August Wilson’s Pulitzer Prize-winning drama “Fences.” He was nominated for eight primetime Emmy awards, winning twice in 1991, for supporting actor in the miniseries “Heat Wave,” about the 1965 Watts riots, and for lead actor in the drama series “Gabriel’s Fire,” about a wrongfully imprisoned ex-cop who becomes a private detective. It was&nbsp;the first time an actor won two Emmys in the same year.

	</p>




<p>
	Jones earned a Kennedy Center Honor in 2002, the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement award in 2009, an honorary Oscar in 2011 and a lifetime achievement Tony Award in 2017. His Grammy award in 1977 for spoken word album makes Jones only one a handful of actors to receive an EGOT.</p>



<p>
	Jones’ looming yet ultimately affable presence and rich speaking voice made him a natural for Shakespeare, and he played some of the great roles, such as Macbeth and Othello, for Joseph Papp’s American Shakespeare Festival. Jones narrated several documentaries, from 1972’s “Malcom X” to the 2007 Disneynature doc “Earth,” and, famously, he intoned the tagline “This is CNN” for the cable news channel.</p>



<p>
	His television credits, which number over 70, including many movies and miniseries such as “Roots” and “The Atlanta Child Murders,” recurring roles on “L.A. Law,” “Homicide: Life on the Street” and “Everwood,” and guest roles on shows like “The Simpsons,” “Picket Fences,” “Law &amp; Order,” “Frasier” and “House.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	As for his most famous role, Jones was paid $7,000 to lend his voice to Darth Vader in 1977’s “Star Wars: A New Hope,” but he declined screen credit for that film and its sequel, 1980’s “The Empire Strikes Back,” out of deference to the actor who played the role on screen, David Prowse. By 1983’s “Return of the Jedi,” however, Jones had become fully synonymous with one of the most memorable and terrifying villains in cinema history, and received credit for his work. He returned to Vader’s voice again for 2005’s “Episode III — Revenge of the Sith” and 2016’s “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” but for the 2022 Disney+ series “Obi-Wan Kenobi,” Jones instead authorized Lucasfilm to use archival recordings and AI technology <a href="https://variety.com/2022/artisans/news/james-earl-jones-darth-vader-retiring-star-wars-ai-1235382827/">to recreate Vader’s voice</a>.</p>



<p>
	When asked in 2014 by the New York Times about how he’d kept his career alive for so long, Jones’ response evoked the kind of plainspoken humility that he had so often brought to his performances as well.</p>



<p>
	“The secret is never forgetting that you’re a journeyman actor and that nothing is your final thing, nothing is your greatest thing, nothing is your worst thing,” Jones <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/magazine/james-earl-jones-on-darth-vader-mufasa-and-natch-totes-mcgotes.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said</a>. “I still consider myself a novice.”</p>



<hr>



<p>
	James Earl Jones was born in 1931 on a farm in in Arkabutla, Miss. His father, Robert Earl Jones, left home soon after to pursue his own acting career (the two more-or-less reconciled when the younger Jones was in his 20s, and they even performed together). When Jones was 5, he moved with his maternal grandparents to Michigan. The shock of the relocation induced a stammer so severe that he often could communicate only in writing. It wasn’t until high school when he started to overcome his stutter, when his English teacher, upon learning that Jones composed poetry, encouraged him to read his writing aloud in class.</p>



<p>
	As an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan, Jones initially set out to study medicine, but wound up more interested in drama. His first stage role was a small part in the 1957 Off Broadway production “Wedding in Japan.” He took side jobs to supplement occasional theater work in Broadway’s “Sunrise at Campobello,” “The Cool World” and “The Pretender.” He also appeared in summer stock.</p>



<p>
	In 1960, Jones joined Papp’s New York Shakespeare Festival. The following year he made his first serious impact in a landmark Off Broadway production of Jean Genet’s “The Blacks” as the protagonist Deodatus. Afterwards, for Papp, he played Oberon in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” the first of many heralded Shakespearean turns. His masterful 1964 performance as Othello for Papp was moved Off Broadway, where the production ran for almost a year.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	Jones’ first big break into cinema came by way of Papp’s production of “The Merchant of Venice,” in which Jones played the Prince of Morocco to George C. Scott’s Shylock. When Stanley Kubrick came to see Scott, whom he was considering for one of the leads in “Dr. Strangelove,” the film director was so impressed that he cast Jones in the film, too. In 1966, Jones had the title role in “Macbeth” at the New York Shakespeare Festival, again to great acclaim. He also booked a recurring role on “As the World Turns” in 1966, marking the first time a Black actor had a continuing role on a daytime soap opera</p>



<p>
	Still, he was almost one of Broadway’s best-kept secrets until 1968 with his performance in Howard Sackler’s “The Great White Hope” as Jack Johnson, the first Black man to win the world heavyweight boxing championship. The Tony, the acclaim and its timing in the late ’60s propelled Jones into the spotlight at a time when it was difficult for Black actors to secure quality roles. The actor, however, has said that the accolades he received for for both the play and its film adaptation did not do that much for his career.</p>



<p>
	It wasn’t until 1977, when Jones’ voice terrified audiences for the first time as Darth Vader, that things truly began to shift for him. That same year, Jones also appeared in ABC’s “Roots” playing the author Alex Haley, whose genealogical novel of the same title inspired the groundbreaking miniseries. He never quite became an outright star in the classic sense of the word, but the back-to-back successes that year did ultimately make Jones a household name, whose presence connoted a stature and gravitas to projects that might otherwise be lacking.</p>



<p>
	Theatre is where Jones most frequently was a box office draw in his own right —&nbsp;and well into his 80s. He returned to Broadway in 2005 for a production of “On Golden Pond” opposite Leslie Uggams, drawing another Tony nomination. In 2008, he played Big Daddy in a production of Tennessee Williams’ “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” that featured an all-Black cast including Terrence Howard, Anika Noni Rose and Phylicia Rashad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Two years later, he returned to Broadway in a revival of “Driving Miss Daisy” opposite Vanessa Redgrave; the production’s move to London in 2011 meant he had to miss the Honorary Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles. Instead, Sir Ben Kingsley surprised Jones with his statuette in person after he’d concluded a matinee performance of the show.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Jones was first married to actress-singer Julienne Marie. His second wife of 34 years, actress Cecilia Hart, died in 2016. He is survived his son, Flynn Earl Jones.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>also the August 2024 financial update, but I’m trying not to bury the lede.<!-- --></em></p>
<!-- --><p>Hi everyone,<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>We have come to the decision to cease operations of cohost and anti software software club due to lack of funding and burnout. As of today, none of us are being paid for our labor<!-- --><sup>1<!-- --></sup>; all of our money in the bank, and any money coming in from people who buy our merch or don’t cancel cohost plus, is going towards servers and operations — paying the bills so we can turn the lights off with as little disruption as possible.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>cohost will become read-only on Tuesday, October 1st. At this time, we will make best-effort attempts to keep the servers online through the end of 2024.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Development focus has immediately shifted to data export. We have offered minimal data export for GDPR compliance for a while now, but this is a barebones system that doesn’t meet our quality standards. We will be improving this system over the next few weeks and will issue full data exports for all users when the site goes read-only. We will continue to offer downloads of your data export through the end of the read-only period.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>When the read-only period concludes, we will delete all of your data from our servers without a backup.  Even now we want to reiterate that we think “data brokerage” and other common practices of the software industry are inimical to who we are as people, and we would never consider selling your data to others or asserting any rights to stuff you posted under any circumstance.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Majority control of the cohost source code will be transferred to the person who funded the majority of our operations, as per the terms of the funding documents we signed with them; Colin and I will retain small stakes so we have some input on what happens to it, at their request.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><hr aria-label="Footnotes">
<!-- --><ol>
<!-- --><li id="user-content-user-content-fn-1">
<!-- --><p>on that note, we’re looking for new jobs. we’ll each be posting about that bit individually. <!-- --></p>
<!-- --></li>
<!-- --></ol>
<!-- --></div><div><hr>
<!-- --><p>So, what happened? If you’ve read our financial updates, you know that we have never been profitable. This isn’t surprising, even with a team of four; social media is a notoriously unprofitable industry. We had planned to bring in new revenue with eggbux (our tipping and subscription product) but policy changes from Stripe forced us to cancel earlier this year.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Since then, we’ve struggled to fill the revenue and morale gap. Colin and I have been doing this for five years, Aidan for three, Kara for nearly two. We’ve been at or over capacity on moderation, engineering, and general operations nearly this entire time. We have all been on-call 24/7/365 since we launched two and a half years ago. The day-to-day needs of just running the site meant developing alternative funding options wasn’t possible.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>MAU and MRR are down across the year. We’ve managed to build a social media platform that many of our users love, but we just don’t have enough users and we don’t have the resources to safely scale up. It’s important to know when to call it quits.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>We’re grateful for all the incredible things y’all have created on cohost. We’re grateful for eggbug. We’re grateful that we were able to try and show a better path for social media, even if it didn’t work out exactly as we would have liked.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>We’re going to do our best to keep things online through the end of the year with the money we have, but we might need additional funding to keep things up until then. If you would be able to contribute funds if necessary, please e-mail us at <!-- --><a href="mailto:corp@antisoftware.club">corp@antisoftware.club<!-- --></a>.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Thank you all for having used cohost. We’ll see you around. <!-- --><img src="https://cohost.org/static/17aa2d48956926005de9.png" alt=":eggbug:" title=":eggbug:"></p>

                 <div><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span> Apple today unveiled <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-10/" target="_blank">Apple Watch Series 10</a>, featuring a refined design and bringing new capabilities to the world’s most popular watch that make it even more powerful, intelligent, and sophisticated. Apple Watch Series 10 is the thinnest Apple Watch yet — making it more comfortable than ever — and offers the biggest, most advanced display of any Apple Watch. It also features new sleep apnea notifications; faster charging; water depth and temperature sensing; plus new health and fitness insights and intelligence in watchOS 11.

                 <div>Apple Watch Series 10 is available in both aluminum and titanium, in an array of stunning colors and finishes. Jet black is a new polished aluminum finish that is distinctively reflective and sleek, while new titanium cases — available in natural, gold, and slate — have a spectacular jewelry-like shine.

                 <div>“Around the world, Apple Watch has had an immeasurable positive impact on people by helping them stay healthy, active, safe, and connected to the things that matter to them — and it’s helped save countless lives along the way,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “Apple Watch Series 10 builds on a decade of breakthrough innovations to offer the most advanced version yet, with even more intelligence, our biggest wearable display, and a design that’s slimmer and sleeker than ever.”

                 <h2><strong>The Sleekest, Thinnest Apple Watch Yet</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Apple Watch Series 10 is nearly 10 percent thinner than Apple Watch Series 7, Series 8, and Series 9, while offering all the advanced capabilities users love, adding new features, and maintaining all-day 18-hour battery life. An innovative metal back integrates the antenna into the housing of the device itself, combining the two layers into one. The back is perfectly matched in material, finish, and color to the rest of the case, making it appear like the device is made from a single piece of metal.

        <div>To detect sleep apnea, Apple Watch uses the accelerometer to monitor small movements at the wrist that are associated with interruptions in normal respiratory patterns, tracked by a new Apple Watch metric called Breathing Disturbances. While some of these disturbances are normal, they are important to track as they can be used to help understand restfulness of sleep and, when occurring frequently over multiple nights, may be associated with sleep apnea. Users can view their nightly Breathing Disturbances in the Health app, where they are classified as elevated or not elevated, and can be viewed over a one-month, six-month, or one-year period.

                 <div>The sleep apnea notification algorithm was developed using advanced machine learning and an extensive data set of clinical-grade sleep apnea tests. The feature was then validated in a clinical study — unprecedented in size for sleep apnea technology. In the clinical validation study, every participant identified by the algorithm had at least mild sleep apnea. The feature is expected to receive marketing authorization from the FDA and other global health authorities soon.

                 <h2><strong>Depth and Temperature Sensing for Water Activities, and the New Tides App</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Apple Watch is great for activities in and around the water, with a swim-proof design that has a 50-meter water resistance rating, automatic stroke detection, and lap counting — and now watchOS 11 introduces Custom Workouts for pool swims. A new depth gauge and water temperature sensor make Apple Watch Series 10 an even better companion when users are headed into the water.

        <div>The new depth gauge can measure down to 6 meters beneath the water’s surface, perfect for snorkeling and shallow diving, or playing in the pool, lake, or ocean. Additionally, the new water temperature sensor measures the temperature of the water once Apple Watch has been submerged. The built-in Depth app is highly legible for easy underwater visibility, displaying the time, current depth, water temperature, duration under water, and maximum depth — with the option to automatically activate as soon as Apple Watch is submerged. Water temperature is also displayed in workout metrics during Pool Swim and Open Water Swim workouts.

Users can also view beaches near their location on a convenient map, and new complications show current tide information for their favorite spots or closest beaches at a glance.

                 <div>Audio can now be played back through the built-in speaker on Apple Watch Series 10. Just like with phone calls, users can listen to audio from a range of apps — including Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Apple Books, and third-party apps — right from their Apple Watch.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Apple Watch Series 10 also uses a new voice isolation neural network running on the 4-core Neural Engine to suppress background noise during phone or FaceTime audio calls, so a user’s voice sounds crisp and clear on the other end of the line — even in noisy environments like a crowded restaurant, a city street, or a windy day outside.

                 <div>For the first time, Apple Watch is available in a polished aluminum finish, jet black, with a distinctively glossy, reflective shine. To achieve this, the aluminum case is polished using nano-particles and then undergoes a 30-step anodization process. Apple Watch Series 10 also comes in an updated rose gold aluminum, along with the popular brushed silver aluminum.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Additionally, Apple Watch Series 10 is available in an aerospace-grade polished titanium that replaces the stainless steel of previous generations. The new grade 5 titanium cases offer a spectacularly reflective, jewelry-like finish, while being almost 20 percent lighter than Apple Watch Series 9 in stainless steel. The titanium cases come in three stunning colors: natural, gold, and slate.

                 <div>Last year, Apple Watch became Apple’s first carbon neutral product by dramatically reducing carbon emissions across the three biggest sources — materials, electricity, and transportation — and using high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects to offset the small amount of emissions remaining. With the introduction of Apple Watch Series 10, made with 100 percent recycled aluminum or 95 percent recycled titanium in the case, customers now can choose a carbon neutral option of any Apple Watch in any material. This is an important step toward Apple 2030, Apple’s ambitious plan to be carbon neutral across its entire carbon footprint by 2030.

<li>Even more customizable <strong>Activity rings</strong>, offering users the ability to specify Activity ring goals by the day of the week, so the rings provide the right amount of motivation at the right moments. Users can also pause their rings for a day, week, month, or more without affecting their award streaks, allowing users to plan a rest day, care for an injury, or just take a day off.</li>
</ul>

        <div>A new collection of Hermès bands draws on the house’s rich history in textiles and craftsmanship. Torsade is a cable-knit band inspired by nautical chains available in single and double tour versions in one of three bold colors. Twill Jump Attelage is a narrow, delicate single tour band with a contrasting edge and silky feel. Grand H is Hermès’s first metal band for Apple Watch, made with interlocking links of satin-finished stainless steel. It features two H-shaped links, removable links customers can use to adjust the size, and a traditional double butterfly closure.

<p>Apple has announced some new hearing health related features, coming as a software update for <a href="https://amzn.to/47rBsra">AirPods Pro 2</a>. </p>



<p>This includes a hearing protection mode being enabled by default, offering passive noise cancellation in loud environments. Apple is also launching a “clinical grade” hearing aid mode, as part of a software update coming later this year.</p>



<p>Firstly, users can take a clinically-validated hearing test. The hearing test uses your AirPods and iPhone, and can be conducted by a user in under five times. The result of your hearing test can be viewed securely in the Health app.</p>



<p>If hearing loss is detected, the hearing aid mode is then available to use. The AirPods will make it easier to hear sounds from the world around you. A custom hearing profile is automatically applied when listening to audio, like music or podcasts. </p>



<p>The hearing aid feature is currently making its way through the FDA and other regulatory bodies. Apple said the functionality will be available in more than 100 countries. The feature will be enabled through a free software update coming later this year to AirPods Pro 2.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in 2008, I wrote some software for fun to generate various optimized walking mechanisms. And when I also picked up some electronics and wood working skills in more recent years, I was able to turn one of these mechanisms into an actual wireless walking wooden coffee table: the Carpentopod. This post briefly covers this project from start to end.</p><figure><figure><a href="https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_with_joystick_grey-3.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="600" height="491" data-id="5087" src="https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_with_joystick_grey-3-600x491.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_with_joystick_grey-3-600x491.jpg 600w, https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_with_joystick_grey-3-292x239.jpg 292w, https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_with_joystick_grey-3-768x628.jpg 768w, https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_with_joystick_grey-3-1536x1256.jpg 1536w, https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_with_joystick_grey-3-2048x1674.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></figure></figure><h2>Designing a new linkage</h2><p>The Carpentopod leg linkage itself was generated by some software I wrote that evolved thousands of virtual generations of leg variations by having them compete against each other. To select which ones were best, each variation got assigned a ‘fitness’ score based on its walking speed, clearance and material use. I also rewarded extra points to variants that had leg tips which moved more horizontally and more smoothly during the lowest third of their cycle to make it favor solutions in which a group of three legs would work together to minimize bobbing and foot slip.</p><p>Each leg variation’s fitness score was then compared, and only the best ones got a chance to mix their genes (i.e. leg parameters) to create the next generation of thousands of variants over and over again, leading to better and better solutions over time. Additionally, next to genes just mixing through ‘natural’ selection, genetic mutations were regularly introduced to help discover new solutions and keep variation going until it was time to converge. Having written everything including the kinematics solver in C++, this simulation was able to evolve dozens of generations per second, making it easy to see how bad initial designs turned into highly optimized ones.</p><p itemprop="video" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/VideoObject"><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.youtube.com/v/AepO45iuH9U"><meta itemprop="name" content="Carpentopod: A walking table project"><meta itemprop="description" content="Carpentopod: A walking table project"><meta itemprop="uploadDate" content="2024-09-01T11:00:28+02:00"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl" content="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AepO45iuH9U/default.jpg"><meta itemprop="embedUrl" content="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AepO45iuH9U"><meta itemprop="height" content="338"><meta itemprop="width" content="600"> <iframe width="600" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AepO45iuH9U?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The video above shows this process for 20 seconds of evolution. Each frame shows a different individual out of 5000 ‘alive’ variations. It also superimposes the trajectory of the leg tip of all 5000 individuals at the same time, creating this red and green ‘blob’ that converges to a single solution over time. The leg linkage that I eventually selected for the Carpentopod itself was simply picked by running a larger and longer version of this simulation. And, like picking an official animal name, I choose its name by combining old Latin and Greek words: carpentum (being a carriage), and pod (for feet or legged).</p><div><figure><a href="https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/Jansen_Theo_Strandbeest_Oper.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" width="150" height="150" src="https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/Jansen_Theo_Strandbeest_Oper-150x150.jpg" data-src="https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/Jansen_Theo_Strandbeest_Oper-150x150.jpg" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>Anyone who’s ever seen one of Theo Jansen’s inspiring Strandbeest sculptures will probably see the similarity between his leg linkage and the Carpentopod linkage. The Carpentopod linkage, however, has a very different set of component ratios, as well as an extra joint point and an evolved rounded toe diameter. These extra parameters allowed the evolution process to find a solution that is more compact and causes less foot slide.</p><p>Foot slide is caused by having different toes on the ground that don’t perfectly match in speed, which will therefore cause the legs to try to slow each other down in practice. (Still, Strandbeest legs often seem to be built with some sort of flexible/rolling toe instead of a rigid one to probably help compensate for this effect somewhat).  See the video below to compare the two different designs, including their effect on size, center of gravity, and foot sliding/skating.</p><p itemprop="video" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/VideoObject"><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.youtube.com/v/k4qrjD_HK4E"><meta itemprop="name" content="Carpentopod: A walking table project"><meta itemprop="description" content="Carpentopod: A walking table project"><meta itemprop="uploadDate" content="2024-09-01T11:00:28+02:00"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl" content="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k4qrjD_HK4E/default.jpg"><meta itemprop="embedUrl" content="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k4qrjD_HK4E"><meta itemprop="height" content="338"><meta itemprop="width" content="600"> <iframe loading="lazy" width="600" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k4qrjD_HK4E?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>Designing a walking table</h2><p>For many years, the above was simply the interesting end result of a hobby project. But as I also picked up an interest in making physical things in more recent years, this allowed me to actually use this linkage for something more tangible. The first thing I tried making was a tiny model of an earlier version of the evolved linkage (being less optimized for compactness and therefore less suitable for what ended up being the Carpentopod table). Just to test my newly developed skills and try out my new CNC before attempting something bigger…</p><p itemprop="video" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/VideoObject"><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.youtube.com/v/Aa0xFO4BmbA"><meta itemprop="name" content="Carpentopod: A walking table project"><meta itemprop="description" content="Carpentopod: A walking table project"><meta itemprop="uploadDate" content="2024-09-01T11:00:28+02:00"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl" content="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Aa0xFO4BmbA/default.jpg"><meta itemprop="embedUrl" content="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aa0xFO4BmbA"><meta itemprop="height" content="338"><meta itemprop="width" content="600"> <iframe loading="lazy" width="600" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aa0xFO4BmbA?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Next, I decided to make a walking wooden coffee table. Mostly because I thought that could be something both (relatively) practical and esthetically pleasing to have. As each individual leg in the Carpentopod linkage is only a third of the walk cycle on the ground, the table itself therefore would require twelve legs to be stable at all times. To walk smoothly, the leg components also needed to be made with sub-millimeter precision and stay that way. This is why I designed them to be CNC-ed out of sheets of laminated bamboo, which is a particularly strong, natural, durable and stable material, and would nicely fit the style of mixing the robotic with the organic.</p><p>I designed all of the table’s components using Autodesk Fusion 360, which allowed me to model, test, render and do all CNC preparations in one package. And being able to actually see it fully assembled in software from any perspective at any phase in its walk cycle made it much easier to tweak the esthetics and make sure all the clearances were just right.</p><figure><figure><a href="https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_sketch-2.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" width="292" height="164" data-id="5101"

2048w"></a></figure></figure><p>Between the six legs on one end and the six on the other, I also left room for a hollow central ‘belly’ to contain  the electronics, motors and battery. To make this not look all angular, I designed the frame and belly to be curved, like an upside down treasure chest. This probably contributed to some people commenting that it looks likes The Luggage from Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels. (But I promise this similarity is purely coincidental and that a Carpentopod table is far less dangerous.)</p><p>The central belly also causes all legs to have at least some distance from the center, which allows them to all participate more effectively in doing turns. Each group of six legs is designed to be connected to its own crank shaft, driven by a single motor. That way, I only needed two separately controlled motors to ‘drive’ and turn the table like a tank.</p><h2>The build</h2><p>To turn the 3D design into an physical table, I preferred to CNC as much as possible. For precision reasons, but also because it makes it a lot easier to churn out twelve identical wooden parts, for example. And this being just a hobby for fun and not a production line, I decided to make everything myself using my cheap 3-axis <a href="https://www.decarpentier.nl/getting-a-better-cnc" data-type="post" data-id="2467" data-wpel-link="internal">CNC router</a>.</p><p>A 3-axis CNC can only remove material from the top. But as many parts would also need material to be removed from the bottom and/or only the sides to make more intricate shapes and concavities, I designed most leg parts to be made out of three sheets of laminated bamboo that I could CNC separately, and then glue together.</p><p itemprop="video" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/VideoObject"><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.youtube.com/v/ayUlgEuYc0M"><meta itemprop="name" content="Carpentopod: A walking table project"><meta itemprop="description" content="Carpentopod: A walking table project"><meta itemprop="uploadDate" content="2024-09-01T11:00:28+02:00"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl" content="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ayUlgEuYc0M/default.jpg"><meta itemprop="embedUrl" content="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ayUlgEuYc0M"><meta itemprop="height" content="338"><meta itemprop="width" content="600"> <iframe loading="lazy" width="600" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ayUlgEuYc0M?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>And of course, even a single part can require many passes with differently sized and shaped cutting tools, and/or may have to be precisely remounted upside down to do both sides. But that’s just the reality of CNC-ing if you don’t want to pay for a much more expensive 5-axis CNC with automated tool changer, and you don’t want to make 3D prints from plastic either…</p><p>Besides the 100+ bamboo parts I CNC-ed, sanded, lacquered and assembled using even more ball bearings and steel shafts, the design also required two crankshafts. I ended up making these by effectively hammering together D-shaped shafts and rotated offsets with D-shaped holes, which I very carefully CNC-ed out of plain aluminum rods and sheets, respectively.</p><figure><figure><a href="https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_crank.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" width="292" height="164" data-id="4917"

jig to give it its new shape. This was then glued on top of two invisible hinged ribs with embedded magnets, making the doors easy to open and close. Lastly, I welded together a piece of TV furniture of the same height, and turned a single piece of mango timber into tops for both pieces of furniture, effectively turning them into a set.</p><h2>Making it move</h2><p>Both six-legged sections should be driven by their own motor. But it’s each section’s single crankshaft that coordinates the relative leg movement. This can be seen in the next video in which I simply push a motor-less section forward, making the section effectively behave like a wheel.</p><p itemprop="video" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/VideoObject"><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.youtube.com/v/R5b97QwAwxg"><meta itemprop="name" content="Carpentopod: A walking table project"><meta itemprop="description" content="Carpentopod: A walking table project"><meta itemprop="uploadDate" content="2024-09-01T11:00:28+02:00"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl" content="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R5b97QwAwxg/default.jpg"><meta itemprop="embedUrl" content="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R5b97QwAwxg"><meta itemprop="height" content="338"><meta itemprop="width" content="600"> <iframe loading="lazy" width="600" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R5b97QwAwxg?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It also contains (upside down) footage showing how the toes would gently touch the ground (that is represented by the black line), but don’t try to push through it. This means that the table won’t ‘bob’ much when walking around. Of course, minimizing bobbing was one of the original evolutionary fitness requirements when the linkage was being evolved in the computer, but it’s always good to test things in reality as well…</p><p>To actually make it move by itself, I ordered two cheap geared 24V brushless motors that are normally meant for automated curtain products, outputting max 1.5 Nm @ 130 RPM. Their built-in electronics also allowed direct speed control using an extra PWM signal wire. Sadly, signaling them to go at low speed almost instantly got them into some automatic multi-second (thermal) shutdown mode even under just a fraction of its maximum load. Luckily, leaving the PWM signals at 100% and directly changing the voltage worked a lot better as can be seen in the following experiment, where I directly connected a tweakable lab power supply to the motor on one of the two 6-legged sections.</p><p itemprop="video" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/VideoObject"><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.youtube.com/v/GyZDItwtMWM"><meta itemprop="name" content="Carpentopod: A walking table project"><meta itemprop="description" content="Carpentopod: A walking table project"><meta itemprop="uploadDate" content="2024-09-01T11:00:28+02:00"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl" content="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GyZDItwtMWM/default.jpg"><meta itemprop="embedUrl" content="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GyZDItwtMWM"><meta itemprop="height" content="338"><meta itemprop="width" content="600"> <iframe loading="lazy" width="600" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GyZDItwtMWM?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To be able to control the motor voltages automatically, though, I bought two cheap Step Up/Down Converter modules to convert basically any battery’s voltage to anywhere between 0 and 24V. Then I hacked them so that their output voltage could directly be set using a fast PWM signal from a repurposed Arduino Nano micro-processer board. The voltage converter modules also offered a tweakable max current setting, which gave me per-motor control over the max stall torque (and therefore the safety of my fingers).</p><p>Next, I fed the exposed Hall-effect motor sensor signals into the Arduino board, and wrote some software in C to create my own closed-loop motor controls. This meant that the motors could now independently and accurately target any achievable speed and position, independent of load.</p><figure><figure><a href="https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_electronics.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" width="600" height="338" data-id="5075" src="https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_electronics-600x338.jpg" data-src="https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_electronics-600x338.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_electronics-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_electronics-292x164.jpg 292w, https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_electronics-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_electronics-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_electronics-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" srcset="https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_electronics-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_electronics-292x164.jpg 292w, https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_electronics-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_electronics-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.decarpentier.nl/wp-content/uploads/carpentopod_electronics-2048x1152.jpg 2048w"></a></figure></figure><p>As a last step, I connected a Bluetooth module to the Arduino and wrote some C code that allows it to connect and understand joystick data coming from the wireless repurposed Nunchuck that I also <a href="https://www.decarpentier.nl/making-a-wireless-joystick" data-type="post" data-id="2525" data-wpel-link="internal">made</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>   <p>The next Apple Watch will detect sleep apnea. In 2017, I helped run the first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-14-deepheart-ai-ids-sleep-apnea-hypertension-apple-watch.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9kYXRhLmVtcGlyaWNhbC5oZWFsdGgv&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHX7y2jFbgSsAig2lS9dQKPzlS5jPwwBXAutRQgvY3hj-isMMk72AmYI1yU8WD6MIH2MJL2ekYFnPNd9-5nTrlQyVVvRrH4lo3bktQs_mko835y2_K36IKbzaeFApncQsMV2rrxBNRQn4mTn3xMWHKHkC4boleHmoS3QluZ8QLY9">research study that detected
sleep apnea using Apple Watch and a deep neural network</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll explain some of the science behind sleep apnea detection (including techniques like peripheral arterial tone) as well as the potential impact of widespread sleep apnea screening (80% of sleep apnea is undiagnosed).</p>
<h2 id="how-on-the-wrist-sleep-apnea-detection-works">How on-the-wrist sleep apnea detection works</h2>
<p>Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition when you stop breathing during sleep, causing your blood oxygen levels to fall. The more often this happens, the more severe the sleep apnea. This frequency of nighttime apnea events is called the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI).</p>
<p>Traditional sleep apnea tests measure five channels: pulse (heart rate), blood oxygen saturation, snoring, nasal flow, and chest motion. On the wrist, only the first three channels are available.</p>
<p>But two “tricks” help us infer the presence of apnea events without nasal flow or chest motion:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Peripheral arterial tone</em>. In 2019, the FDA approved the first sleep apnea test, the WatchPAT 1, to use a new technique called peripheral arterial tone. Unlike traditional sleep apnea tests, peripheral arterial tone can be measured entirely with sensors on the wrist. We’ll go deeper on peripheral arterial tone in the next section.</li>
<li><em>Cardiovascular signals.</em> Our 2017 study used only heart rate and step count as raw inputs into a deep neural network (an LSTM, at the time). Nowadays, the Apple Watch calculates 20+ metrics of health across multiple organ systems, including several heart health metrics. I just performed an updated analysis that showed <a href="https://www.empirical.health/blog/cardiovascular-metrics-sleep-apnea/">5 of the top 10 predictors of sleep apnea risk are cardiovascular</a> in nature. These heart signals, even if of modest individual accuracy, may help accurately detect sleep apnea when combined.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="peripheral-arterial-tone--the-autonomic-nervous-system">Peripheral arterial tone &amp; the autonomic nervous system</h2>
<p>Peripheral arterial tone (PAT) measures variations in arterial volume, which reflects the activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS).</p>
<p>The ANS controls involuntary bodily functions, including heart rate. You can think of the ANS as a constant “tug of war” between two halves: the sympathetic nervous system (“fight or flight”) and the parasympathetic nervous system (“rest and digest”). When the sympathetic nervous system dominates, heart rate is higher, heart rate variability is low, and your arteries tensen. When the parasympathetic system dominates, heart rate is lower, HRV is high, and your arteries are less tense.</p>
<p>During episodes of apnea (when breathing stops during sleep), the body’s oxygen levels drop, triggering a surge in sympathetic activity to compensate. This response can cause significant fluctuations in PAT, which allows a wrist-based device to pick up on the apnea event.</p>
<p>In 2019, the FDA cleared the first medical device to use peripheral arterial tone to test for sleep apnea — the WatchPAT ONE. This cleared the way for manufacturers of consumer wearables, like Apple and Samsung, to build algorithms that detect sleep apnea.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the output of these tests is a number — the apnea-hypopnea-index (AHI). The AHI is the number of apnea or hypopnea events per hour. Low severity sleep apnea is 5-14, medium severity sleep apnea is an AHI of 15-29, and high severity sleep apnea is an AHI of 30 or more.</p>
<p>Is peripheral arterial tone accurate for detecting sleep apnea?
In a word, yes. A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24158564/">2013 meta-study</a> showed high correlation (0.89) between PAT and conventional sleep testing. Subsequent studies have validated the technology in patients with COPD and atrial fibrillation.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-impact-of-apple-watch-sleep-apnea-screening">What’s the impact of Apple Watch sleep apnea screening?</h2>
<p>80% of sleep apnea cases are undiagnosed. Undiagnosed sleep apnea affects more than 23.5 million people in the US alone, leading to $150B of wasted medical spend every year.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do-when-your-apple-watch-detects-sleep-apnea">What to do when your Apple Watch detects sleep apnea</h2>
<p>If your Apple Watch alerts you to sleep apnea, or you suspect you’re at risk, you need to&nbsp;talk with a doctor about getting an&nbsp;at-home sleep test.</p>

<p><em>Last updated on:</em></p>


<p><time datetime="2024-09-08T23:04:02-04:00">September 8, 2024</time></p>


<h2>Project Goal</h2>



<p><em>Project Hammer</em> aims to drive more competition and reduce collusion in the Canadian grocery sector.</p>



<p>To get this done, we will:<br>1. Compile a database of historical grocery prices from top grocers’ websites.<br>2. Make the database available in a format that is suitable for academic analysis and for legal action.<br>3. Inform changemakers of the existence of this dataset (and make it reasonably easy for them to use).</p>



<h2>I Need Your Help</h2>



<p>I can’t do this alone. This project can only succeed with a community of people around it – people like you, who bring their own skills and perspectives to the challenge.</p>



<p>Reach out to me (email “jacob” at this website) if:</p>



<ul>
<li>You can do economic analysis of pricing data, and especially the interaction/correlation of multiple streams of prices across time</li>



<li>You are skilled with data processing and normalization</li>



<li>You’d play with the data for 1 day and tell me of all the bugs/issues/opportunities you found</li>



<li>You are doing similar pricing work in other countries / you’ve been inspired by <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@badlogic/111071396799790275">Mario Zechner’s work</a></li>



<li>You are a data-oriented politician, aide, activist, journalist or lawyer who’s interested in improving Canada’s <a href="https://apps.fas.usda.gov/newgainapi/api/Report/DownloadReportByFileName?fileName=Retail%20Foods_Ottawa_Canada_CA2022-0018.pdf">hyper-concentrated grocery sector</a></li>

<h2>Canadian Grocery Price Data</h2>



<p>SQLite file with data from June 10, 2024 to September 8, 2024:</p>







<p>Contains prices from 7 Canadian grocery websites. I recommend that you open it with the <a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/">free DB Browser</a> application and play with the “raw” table / export to .csv.</p>

<h2>Analysis Ideas</h2>



<ul>
<li>Visualize the price of making a standard sandwich at each of the grocers (200g white bread + 20g ham + 20g lettuce...)</li>



<li>Nov. 1 to Feb. 5 price freeze on certain products:<br><em><a href="https://www.cochranetimespost.ca/opinion/columnists/charlebois-are-grocers-still-colluding">Metro stated that “It is an industry practice to have a price freeze from Nov. 1 to Feb. 5 for all private label and national brand grocery products, and this will be the case in all Metro outlets.”</a></em></li>



<li>When a product goes on "sale", how long has it been since the previous sale? (if something is constantly on sale, then that's just its regular price)</li>



<li>When something's on "sale", did the price get jacked up artificially just ahead of the sale, only to lower it back down to normal?</li>



<li>How are different grocers responding to each other's price moves?
<ul>
<li>Is someone always leading price movements?</li>



<li>Is someone always reactive?</li>



<li>Do prices move exactly in tandem?</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Which grocer is generally the cheapest across all comparable product families?</li>
</ul>

<p><span lang="EN-IE">Despite being informed of the fallibility of the AI systems in the study, two-thirds of subjects allowed their decisions to be influenced by the AI. The work, conducted by scientists at the University of California – Merced, is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-69771-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published in Scientific Reports</a>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IE">“As a society, with AI accelerating so quickly, we need to be concerned about the potential for overtrust,” said principal investigator Professor&nbsp;Colin Holbrook, a member of UC Merced’s&nbsp;<a href="https://cogsci.ucmerced.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Cognitive and Information Sciences.</a></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IE">According to Holbrook, the study’s design was a means of testing the broader question of putting too much trust in AI under uncertain circumstances. He said the findings are not just about military decisions and could be applied to contexts such as police being influenced by AI to use lethal force or a paramedic being swayed by AI when deciding who to treat first in a medical emergency. It’s claimed the findings could also be applicable to major life decisions such as buying a home.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IE">“Our project was about high-risk decisions made under uncertainty when the AI is unreliable,” said Holbrook. “</span><span>We should have a healthy scepticism about AI, especially in life-or-death decisions.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IE">“We see AI doing extraordinary things and we think that because it’s amazing in this domain, it will be amazing in another. We can’t assume that. These are still devices with limited abilities.”</span></p>

plays a foundational role in many pieces of software, especially database management systems (DMBSs).<!-- --> <!-- -->MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB, Dynamo, and many others rely on B-trees to perform efficient data lookups via <strong>indexes</strong>.<!-- --> <!-- -->By the time you finish this article, you'll have learned how B-trees and B+trees work, why databases use them for indexes, and why using a UUID as your primary key <a href="https://planetscale.com/blog/the-problem-with-using-a-uuid-primary-key-in-mysql">might be a bad idea</a>.<!-- --> <!-- -->You'll also have the opportunity to play with <em>interactive</em> animations of the data structures we discuss.<!-- --> <!-- -->Get ready to click buttons.</p><p>Computer science has a plethora of data structures to choose from for storing, searching, and managing data on a computer.<!-- --> <!-- -->The B-tree is one such structure, and is commonly used in database applications.<!-- --> <!-- -->B-trees store pairs of data known as <em>keys</em> and <em>values</em> in what computer programmers call a tree-like structure.<!-- --> <!-- -->For those not acquainted with how computer scientists use the term "tree" it actually looks more like a root system.</p><p>Below you'll find the first <em>interactive</em> component of this blog.<!-- --> <!-- -->This allows you to visualize the structure of a B-tree and see what happens as you <span>add key/value pairs</span> and <span>change the number of key/value pairs per node</span>.<!-- --> <!-- -->Give it a try by clicking the <span>Add</span> or <span>Add random</span> button a few times and try to get an intuitive sense of how it works before we move on to the details.</p><p>If the animations above are too fast or slow, you can adjust the animation speed of everything that happens with the B-trees in this article.<!-- --> <!-- -->Adjust below:</p><p>Every B-tree is made up of <strong>nodes</strong> (the rectangles) and <strong>child pointers</strong> (the lines connecting the nodes).<!-- --> <!-- -->We call the top-most node the <strong>root node</strong>, the nodes on the bottom level <strong>leaf nodes</strong>, and everything else <strong>internal nodes</strong>.<!-- --> <!-- -->The formal definition of a B-tree can vary depending on who you ask, but the following is a pretty typical definition.</p><p><strong>A B-tree of order K is a tree structure with the following properties:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Each node in the tree stores N key/value pairs, where N is greater than 1 and less than or equal to K.</strong></li><li><strong>Each internal node has at least N/2 key/value pairs (an internal node is one that is not a leaf or the root).</strong></li><li><strong>Each node has N+1 children.</strong></li><li><strong>The root node has at least one value and two children, unless it is the sole node.</strong></li><li><strong>All leaves are on the same level.</strong></li></ul><p>The other key characteristic of a B-tree is ordering.<!-- --> <!-- -->Within each node the elements are kept in order.<!-- --> <!-- -->Any child to the left of a key must only contain other keys that are less than it.<!-- --> <!-- -->Children to the right must have keys that are greater than it.</p><p>This enforced ordering means you can <strong>search for a key</strong> very efficiently.<!-- --> <!-- -->Starting at the <strong>root node</strong>, do the following:</p><ol><li>Check if the node contains the key you are looking for.</li><li>If not, find the location in the node where your key would get inserted into, if you were adding it.</li><li>Follow the <strong>child pointer</strong> at this spot down to the next level, and repeat the process.</li></ol><p>When searching in this way, you only need to visit <em>one</em> node at each level of the tree to search for one key.<!-- --> <!-- -->Therefore, the less levels it has (or the shallower it is), the faster searching can be performed.<!-- --> <!-- -->Try <span>searching</span> for some keys in the tree below:</p><p>B-trees are uniquely suited to work well when you have a <em>very large</em> quantity of data that also needs to be persisted to long-term storage (disk).<!-- --> <!-- -->This is because each node uses a fixed number of bytes.<!-- --> <!-- -->The number of bytes can be tailored to play nicely with <strong>disk blocks</strong>.</p><p>Reading and writing data on hard-drive disks (HDDs) and solid-state disks (SSDs) is done in units called <strong>blocks</strong>.<!-- --> <!-- -->These are typically byte sequences of length 4096, 8192, or 16384 (4k, 8k, 16k).<!-- --> <!-- -->A single disk will have a capacity of many millions or billions of blocks.<!-- --> <!-- -->RAM on the other hand is typically addressable on a per-byte level.</p><p>This is why B-trees work so well when we need to organize and store <em>persistent</em> data on disk.<!-- --> <!-- -->Each node of a B-tree can be sized to match to the size of a disk block (or a multiple of this size).</p><p>The number of values each node of the tree can store is based on the number of bytes each is allocated and the number of bytes consumed by each key / value pair.<!-- --> <!-- -->In the example above, you saw some pretty small nodes — ones storing 3 integer values and 4 pointers.<!-- --> <!-- -->If our disk block and B-tree node is 16k, and our keys, values, and child pointers are all 8 bits, this means we could store 682 key/values with 683 child pointers per node.<!-- --> <!-- -->A three level tree could store over 300 <em>million</em> key/value pairs (682 × 682 × 682 = 317,214,568).</p><h2 id="the-superior-b-tree-for-databases-"><a href="#the-superior-b-tree-for-databases-">The superior B+Tree (for databases)</a></h2><p>B-trees are great, but many database indexes use a "fancier" variant called the B+tree.<!-- --> <!-- -->It's similar to a B-tree, with the following changes to the rules:</p><ul><li><strong>Key/value pairs are stored only at the leaf nodes.</strong></li><li><strong>Non-leaf nodes store only keys and the associated child pointers.</strong></li></ul><p>There are two additional rules that are specific to how B+trees are implemented in MySQL indexes:</p><ul><li><strong>Non-leaf nodes store N child pointers instead of N+1.</strong></li><li><strong>All nodes also contain "next" and "previous" pointers, allowing each level of the tree to also act as a doubly-linked list.</strong></li></ul><p>Here's another visualization showing how the B+tree works with these modified characteristics.<!-- --> <!-- -->This time you can individually adjust the number of <span>keys in inner nodes</span> and <span>in the leaf nodes</span>, in addition to <span>adding key/value pairs</span>.</p><p>Why are B+ trees better for databases?<!-- --> <!-- -->There are two primary reasons.</p><ol><li>Since inner nodes do <em>not</em> have to store values, we can fit more keys per inner node! This can help keep the tree shallower.</li><li>All of the <em>values</em> can be stored at the same level, and traversed in-order via the bottom-level linked list.</li></ol><p>Go ahead and give <span>searching</span> on a B+tree a try as well:</p><h2 id="how-mysql-uses-b-trees"><a href="#how-mysql-uses-b-trees">How MySQL uses B+trees</a></h2><p>MySQL, arguably the world's most popular database management system, supports multiple storage engines.<!-- --> <!-- -->The most commonly used engine is InnoDB which relies <em>heavily</em> on B+Trees.<!-- --> <!-- -->In fact, it relies <em>so</em> heavily on them that it actually stores <em>all table data</em> in a B+tree, with the table's primary key used as the tree key.</p><p>Whenever you create a new InnoDB table you are required to specify a primary key.<!-- --> <!-- -->Database administrators and software engineers often use a simple auto-incrementing integer for this value.<!-- --> <!-- -->Behind the scenes, MySQL + InnoDB creates an B+tree for each new table created.<!-- --> <!-- -->The keys for this tree are whatever the primary key was set to.<!-- --> <!-- -->The values are the remaining column values for each row, and are stored only in the leaf nodes.</p><p>The size of each node in these B+trees is set to 16k by default.<!-- --> <!-- -->Whenever MySQL needs to access a piece of data (keys, values, whatever), it loads the entire associated page (B+tree node) from disk, even if that page contains other keys or values it does not need.</p><p>The number of rows stored in each node depends on how "wide" the table is.<!-- --> <!-- -->In a "narrow" table (a table with few columns), each leaf could store hundreds of rows.<!-- --> <!-- -->In a "wide" table (a table with many columns), each leaf may only store a single-digit number of rows.<!-- --> <!-- -->InnoDB also supports rows is being larger than a disk block, but we won't dig in to that in this post.</p><p>Use the visualization below to see how the number of <span>keys in each inner node</span> and <span>in each leaf node</span> affect the <span>depth of the tree</span>.<!-- --> <!-- -->The deeper the tree, the slower it is to look up elements.<!-- --> <!-- -->Thus, we want shallow trees for our databases!</p><p>It's also common to create secondary indexes on InnoDB tables — ones on columns other than the primary key.<!-- --> <!-- -->These may be needed to speed up WHERE clause filtering in SQL queries.<!-- --> <!-- -->An additional persistent B+tree is constructed for each secondary index.<!-- --> <!-- -->For these, the key is the column(s) that the user selected the index to be built for.<!-- --> <!-- -->The values are the <strong>primary key</strong> of the associated row.<!-- --> <!-- -->Whenever a secondary index is used for a query:</p><ol><li>A search is performed on the secondary index B+tree.</li><li>The primary keys for matching results are collected.</li><li>These are then used to do additional B+tree lookup(s) on the main table B+tree to then find the actual row data.</li></ol><p>Consider the following database schema:</p><div><pre><code><p><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>TABLE</span><span> </span><span>user</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span>

</p></code></pre></div><p>This will cause two B+tree indexes to be created:</p><ul><li>One for the table's primary key, using <code>user_id</code> for the key and the other two columns stored in the values.</li><li>Another for the <code>email_index</code>, with <code>email</code> as the key and <code>user_id</code> as the value.</li></ul><p>When a query like this is executed:</p><div><pre><code><p><span>SELECT</span><span> username </span><span>FROM</span><span> </span><span>user</span><span> </span><span>WHERE</span><span> email </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'x@planetscale.com'</span><span>;</span>
</p></code></pre></div><p>This will first perform a lookup for <code>x@planetscale.com</code> on the <code>email_index</code> B+tree.<!-- --> <!-- -->After it has found the associated <code>user_id</code> value it will use that to perform another lookup into the primary key B+tree, and fetch the username from there.</p><p>Overall, we'd like to always minimize the number of blocks / nodes that need to be visited to fulfill a query.<!-- --> <!-- -->The fewer nodes we have to visit, the faster our query can go.<!-- --> <!-- -->The <strong>primary key</strong> you choose for a table is pivotal in minimizing the number of nodes we need to visit.</p><h2 id="primary-key-choice-insertions"><a href="#primary-key-choice-insertions">Primary key choice: insertions</a></h2><p>The way your table's data is arranged in a B+tree depends on the key you choose.<!-- --> <!-- -->This means your choice of <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> will impact the layout on disk of all of the data in the table, and in turn performance.<!-- --> <!-- -->Choose your <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> wisely!</p><p>Two common choices for a primary key are:</p><ul><li>An integer sequence (such as <code>BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT</code>)</li><li>A <code>UUID</code>, of which there are <a href="https://planetscale.com/blog/the-problem-with-using-a-uuid-primary-key-in-mysql">many versions</a>.</li></ul><p>Let's first consider the consequences of using a <a href="https://planetscale.com/blog/the-problem-with-using-a-uuid-primary-key-in-mysql#uuidv4">UUIDv4</a> primary key.<!-- --> <!-- -->A UUIDv4 is a mostly-random 128 bit integer.</p><p>We can simulate this by <span>inserting a bunch of random integers</span> into our B+tree visualization.<!-- --> <!-- -->On each insertion, all of the visited nodes will be <span>highlighted green</span>.<!-- --> <!-- -->You can also control <span>the percentage of keys</span> to keep in the existing node when a split occurs.<!-- --> <!-- -->Give it a try by clicking the <span>Add random</span> button several times.<!-- --> <!-- -->What do you notice?</p><p>A few observations:</p><ol><li>The nodes visited for an insert are unpredictable ahead of time.</li><li>The destination leaf node for an insert is unpredictable.</li><li>The <strong>values</strong> in the leaves are not in order.</li></ol><p>Issues 1 and 2 are problematic because over the course of many insertions we'll have to visit many of the nodes (pages) in the tree.<!-- --> <!-- -->This excessive reading and writing leads to poor performance.<!-- --> <!-- -->Issue 3 is problematic if we intend to ever search for or view our data in the order it was inserted.</p><p>The same problem can arise (albeit in a less extreme way) with some other UUIDs as well.<!-- --> <!-- -->For example, UUID v3 and v5 are both generated from via hashing, and therefore will not be sequential and have similar behavior to inserting randomly.<!-- --> <!-- -->Alternatively, <a href="https://planetscale.com/blog/the-problem-with-using-a-uuid-primary-key-in-mysql#uuidv7">UUIDv7</a> actually does a good job of overcoming some of these challenges.</p><p>Let's consider using a sequential <code>BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT</code> as our primary key instead.<!-- --> <!-- -->Try <span>inserting sequential values</span> into the B+ tree instead:</p><p>This mitigates all of the aforementioned problems:</p><ol><li>We always follow the right-most path when inserting new values.</li><li>Leaves only get added on the right side of the tree.</li><li>At the leaf level, data is in sorted order based on when it was inserted.</li></ol><p>Because of 1 and 2, many insertions happening in sequence will revisit the same path of pages, leading to fewer I/O requests when inserting a lot of key/value pairs.</p><p>The bar chart below shows the number of unique nodes visited for the previous 5 inserts on the two B+trees above.<!-- --> <!-- -->Assuming trees of the same depth, you should see random one being slightly higher, meaning worse performance.</p><p>If you are curious about the effect of the <span>split percentage</span> on sequential vs random insert patterns, check out the interactive visualization below.<!-- --> <!-- -->Use the slider to set the <span>split percentage</span>.<!-- --> <!-- -->The line graph will update to show how many nodes needed to be visited for the prior 5 at various points in a 400-key insertion sequence.<!-- --> <!-- -->Notice that in most cases, the <span>sequential inserts</span> require much fewer node visits than <span>random inserts</span>, and are also more predictable.</p><h2 id="primary-key-choice-reading-data-in-order"><a href="#primary-key-choice-reading-data-in-order">Primary key choice: reading data in

consideration is key size.<!-- --> <!-- -->We always want our primary keys to be:</p><ol><li>Big enough to never face exhaustion</li><li>Small enough to not use excessive storage</li></ol><p>For integer sequences, we can sometimes get away with a <code>MEDIUMINT</code> (16 million unique values) or <code>INT</code> (4 billion unique values) for smaller tables.<!-- --> <!-- -->For big tables, we often jump to <code>BIGINT</code> to be safe (18 sextillion possible values).<!-- --> <code>BIGINT</code>s are 64 bits (8 bytes).<!-- --> <!-- -->UUIDs are typically 128 bits (16 bytes), twice the size of even the largest integer type in MySQL.<!-- --> <!-- -->Since B+tree nodes are a fixed size, a <code>BIGINT</code> will allow us to fit more keys per-node than UUIDs.<!-- --> <!-- -->This results in shallower trees and faster lookups.</p><p>Consider a case where each tree node is only 100 bytes, child pointers are 8 bytes, and values are 8 bytes.<!-- --> <!-- -->We could fit 4 UUIDs (plus 4 child pointers) in each node.<!-- --> <!-- -->Hit the <span>play insertion sequence</span> button below to see the inserts.</p><p>If we had used a <code>BIGINT</code> instead, we could fit 6

href="#b-trees-pages-and-innodb">B+trees, Pages and InnoDB</a></h2><p>Recall that one of the big benefits of a B+tree is the fact that we can set the node size to whatever we want.<!-- --> <!-- -->In InnoDB, the B+tree nodes are typically set to 16k, the size of an <strong>InnoDB page</strong>.</p><p>When fulfilling a query (and therefore traversing B+trees), InnoDB does not read individual rows and columns from disk.<!-- --> <!-- -->Whenever it needs to access a piece of data, it loads the entire associated page from disk.</p><p>InnoDB has some tricks up its sleeve to mitigate this, the main one being the <strong>buffer pool</strong>.<!-- --> <!-- -->The buffer pool is an in-memory cache for InnoDB pages, sitting between the pages on-disk and MySQL query execution.<!-- --> <!-- -->When MySQL needs to read a page, it first checks if it's already in the buffer pool.<!-- --> <!-- -->If so, it reads it from there, skipping the disk I/O operation.<!-- --> <!-- -->If not, it finds the page on-disk, adds it to the buffer pool, and then continues query execution.</p><p>The buffer pool <em>drastically</em> helps query performance.<!-- --> <!-- -->Without it, we'd end up doing significantly more disk I/O operations to handle a query workload.<!-- --> <!-- -->Even with the buffer pool, minimizing the number of pages that needs to be visited helps performance (1) because there's still a (small) cost to looking up a page in the buffer pool, and (2) it helps reduce the number of buffer pool loads and evictions that need to take place.</p><h2 id="other-situations"><a href="#other-situations">Other situations</a></h2><p>Here, we mostly focused on comparing a sequential key to a random / UUID key.<!-- --> <!-- -->However, the principles shown here are useful to keep in mind no matter what kind of primary or secondary key you are considering.</p><p>For example, you may also consider using a <code>user.created_at</code> timestamp as a key for an index.<!-- --> <!--

something like a <code>user.email_address</code> string will have more similar characteristics to a random key.<!-- --> <!-- -->Users won't be creating accounts in email-alphabetical order, so insertions will happen all over the place in the B+tree.</p><h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2><p>This is already a long blog post, and yet, much more could be said about b+trees, indexes, and primary key choice in MySQL.<!-- --> <!-- -->On the surface it may seem simple, but there's an incredible amount of nuance to consider if you want to squeeze every ounce of

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) buckets are a popular storage service used by software companies and organizations to store public as well as sensitive data. However, the implementation of this service is not always correctly done. A single missing access policy can often introduce security risks, data leaks, or other unintended consequences.</p><p>In this article, we will cover some of the most common security misconfigurations in AWS S3 buckets.</p><p>There are several ways to find and identify AWS S3 bucket names. Below are 3 of the most effective ways of enumerating AWS S3 buckets.</p><h3>Examining HTTP responses:</h3><p>One method is simply examining HTTP responses in your proxy intercepting tool. Often AWS S3 bucket references &amp; links are included in the HTTP response to load images or other files. Search for:</p><pre data-language="regex"><code>\.s3\.amazonaws\.com\/?</code></pre><p>Or search for one of the following HTTP response headers:</p><pre data-language="http"><code>x-amz-bucket-region
x-amz-request-id
x-amz-id-2</code></pre><div><p>Example of an AWS S3 bucket response</p></div><h3>Dorking:</h3><p>Several popular search engines like Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo and Brave Search support search syntaxis. You can take advantage of this by specifically looking for your company and browse through indexed results.</p><pre data-language="markdown"><code>site:.s3.amazonaws.com "company"</code></pre><div><p>Finding AWS S3 buckets with search engines</p></div><h3>Bruteforcing:</h3><p>You can also bruteforce common keywords your target may use as a bucket name. Automated tools such as <strong>S3enum</strong> and <strong>cloud_enum</strong> can help you enumerate AWS S3 buckets.</p><p>Now that know how to enumerate AWS S3 buckets, we can start testing each one of them individually. At the end of this article, we will also go over a few popular open-source tools to help you automate these checks.</p><p><strong>TIP! To test AWS S3 buckets, we will need an active AWS account and the </strong><a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli"><strong>official AWS CLI</strong></a><strong> installed. Make sure to also configure your AWS CLI after successfully installing it.</strong></p><p>The most basic test we can perform on an AWS S3 bucket is testing the list permissions. Previously, AWS S3 buckets had list permissions enabled by default. But recently that changed and any newly created buckets have list permissions disabled by default. Developers and admins will now need to explicitly declare a policy to allow S3 listing.</p><p>We can however still test for list permissions on our target AWS S3 bucket by running the following command:</p><pre data-language="bash"><code>aws s3 ls s3://{BUCKET_NAME} --no-sign-request</code></pre><p>You should receive the following output if list permissions are enabled:</p><p><strong>TIP! Before reporting a potential security misconfiguration, always verify the impact of the vulnerability! Some AWS S3 buckets are meant to be public!</strong></p><p>As you can see from the previous results, we could list all the contents inside a storage bucket with list permissions enabled. Access controls can also be set on individual objects within a storage bucket.</p><p>An example might be that the <code>index.html</code> file is accessible but the <code>archive.zip</code> is not. But before jumping to any conclusions, we can simply perform the test ourselves:</p><pre data-language="bash"><code>aws s3api get-object --bucket {BUCKET_NAME} --key archive.zip ./OUTPUT --no-sign-request</code></pre><p><em>Make sure to replace the filename and bucket name in the command above.</em></p><p>To quickly check if we can download and read files, we can use the <code>cp</code> subcommand:</p><pre data-language="bash"><code>aws s3 cp s3://{BUCKET_NAME}/intigriti.txt ./ --no-sign-request</code></pre><p><em>Make sure to replace the filename and bucket name in the command above.</em></p><p>To test for missing write permissions, we can use the following command:</p><pre data-language="bash"><code>aws s3 cp intigriti.txt s3://{BUCKET_NAME}/intigriti-ac5765a7-1337-4543-ab45-1d3c8b468ad3.txt --no-sign-request</code></pre><p><em>Make sure to use a filename with a non-trivial name to prevent any disruption and replace the bucket name in the command above.</em></p><p>This operation can write and even overwrite a file, essentially deleting the old one. If bucket versioning is not enabled, the changes are permanent and permanent data loss is possible which can be catastrophic for a company.</p><p>An Access Control List (ACL, commonly also referred to as ACP) is a predefined scheme to help manage access controls on a specific S3 bucket or an object within an S3 bucket.</p><p>These ACLs can also have misconfigured access controls and allow malicious actors to request them, essentially allowing them to take a shortcut and easily enumerate any storage buckets or objects with misconfigured access controls.</p><p>To attempt to read an ACL on your S3 storage bucket using the AWS CLI, run the following command:</p><pre data-language="bash"><code>aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket {BUCKET_NAME} --no-sign-request</code></pre><p><em>Make sure to replace the bucket name in the command above.</em></p><p>To read an ACL on a specific object within a bucket using the AWS CLI, run the following command:</p><pre data-language="bash"><code>aws s3api get-object-acl --bucket {BUCKET_NAME} --key index.html --no-sign-request</code></pre><p><em>Make sure to replace the filename and bucket name in the command above.</em></p><p>AWS also provides you the option to overwrite any Access Control List (ACL) for an S3 storage bucket or object.</p><p>If permissions are misconfigured, it would allow a malicious actor to overwrite any current policies. This could allow a malicious actor to grant himself/herself permission to view the contents of the S3 storage bucket with no extra effort.</p><p>We can test for write permissions on ACLs by running the following command:</p><pre data-language="bash"><code>aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket {BUCKET_NAME} --grant-full-control emailaddress={EMAIL} --no-sign-request</code></pre><p><em>Make sure to replace the bucket name and the email in the command above.</em></p><p><strong>TIP! You do not have to always necessarily change an ACL to test for write permissions if read permissions are enabled. You can simply check the "Grants" property in the response to a read operation and verify if any unauthorized users are allowed to perform the write operation!</strong></p><p>AWS S3 buckets are often also used for storing public data such as profile images. And there are several ways developers are used to upload data to an AWS S3:</p><ol><li><p>Make the client upload the data to the company's API server, perform validations on the uploaded file, and finally store it on AWS S3 and return the public URL. The API server acts here as a proxy between the client and the AWS S3 bucket API.</p></li><li><p>Or make the client upload the data directly to AWS S3 by sending a form upload request to the AWS S3 bucket API. The API will return a link from which you can access the resource. To perform validation, you'd have to <a target="_blank" href="https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/s3-allow-certain-file-types">declare additional policies to the <code>s3:PutObject</code> for your AWS S3 bucket</a> (this step is often neglected as developers aren't aware of it).</p></li></ol><p>The reason why most developers select the latter approach over the former is to decrease the load on their server. However, as mentioned before, developers often forget to declare additional file type restriction policies to further control what can be uploaded.</p><p>In other words, as an attacker, you can often easily upload malicious files like SVG files to achieve stored XSS for example.</p><p>In this video by <a href="https://x.com/gregxsunday">@gregxsunday</a>, you could view another example of how developers sometimes make mistakes when integrating AWS S3:</p><p>S3 versioning is an additional security measure to allow bucket owners to store multiple versions of the same object. If an object accidentally gets modified, or even worse deleted, admins can simply revert to the latest version and undo the unwanted action. </p><p>For that reason, AWS always recommends you enable S3 versioning. However, storing multiple versions of the same file comes with additional costs that most development teams want to prevent. Turning that option off seems reasonable but this comes with a few security issues. If a malicious user ever gets the chance to delete or overwrite files, the changes will be permanent and there will be no way of restoring the original data objects (unless a separate backup is made).</p><p>You can test if unauthorized users can check if S3 versioning is enabled by running the following command:</p><pre data-language="bash"><code>aws s3api get-bucket-versioning --bucket {BUCKET_NAME} --no-sign-request</code></pre><p>Enumerating and testing all your targets' S3 buckets individually can be a tedious task, especially when your target makes use of several S3 buckets. Fortunately for us, there are several open-source tools that we can make use of.</p><p>Here are a few open-source tools listed that can help with identifying and exploiting AWS S3 buckets.</p><p><strong>S3enum</strong></p><p>S3enum is a fast and stealthy AWS S3 bucket enumeration tool written in Golang and used by bug bounty hunters and penetration testers to enumerate AWS S3 buckets.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/koenrh/s3enum">https://github.com/koenrh/s3enum</a></p><p><strong>cloud_enum</strong></p><p>cloud_enum is an extensive OSINT tool to help bug bounty hunters and penetration testers enumerate cloud buckets such as AWS S3, GCP buckets and even Azure storage buckets.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/initstring/cloud_enum">https://github.com/initstring/cloud_enum</a></p><p><strong>LazyS3</strong></p><p>LazyS3 is a Ruby script that is capable of enumerating and identifying potential S3 buckets that belong to your target.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/nahamsec/lazys3">https://github.com/nahamsec/lazys3</a></p><p><strong>AWS Extender</strong></p><p>AWS Extender is a Burpsuite plugin (Professional edition only) to help you test for permissions on AWS S3, Google Cloud Provider storage buckets and Azure Storage Containers.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/VirtueSecurity/aws-extender">https://github.com/VirtueSecurity/aws-extender</a></p><p><strong>Nuclei</strong></p><p>Nuclei is a powerful template-based scanner that is capable of identifying and testing several permissions and access control lists (ACLs) on AWS S3 buckets using custom templates.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei">https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei</a></p><p>You've probably already come across an AWS S3 bucket, maybe even a misconfigured one too, and if you ignored them before, we hope this article shines some light on the most common security misconfigurations present in this storage bucket service.</p><p>So, you’ve just learned something new about AWS S3 security misconfigurations… Right now, it’s time to put your skills to the test!

<p><a href="https://mntre.com/reform_next_images/nref-proto-overview.jpg"><img src="https://mntre.com/reform_next_images/nref-proto-overview.jpg" alt="MNT Reform Next Prototype, Overview" title="MNT Reform Next Prototype, Overview"></a></p>

<p>A future proof laptop with a retro futuristic aesthetic: This is MNT Reform Next.</p>

<p>Based on <a href="https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform">Classic MNT Reform</a>, our new laptop takes Open Source Hardware to a new level. By combining high performance and high mobility with modularity, customizability, and repairability, MNT Reform Next has the potential to become more than just your daily driver.</p>

<h2 id="the-original-open-hardware-laptop-reloaded">The original Open Hardware laptop, reloaded.</h2>

<p>Being highly performant, modular, and upgradeable, MNT Reform Next gives you more freedom than any other laptop. Swap modules, print your own case, customize your keyboard. Since we are committed to open hardware, all <a href="https://source.mnt.re/reform/reform-next">sources are public</a>.</p>

<p>While Classic MNT Reform is a portable device, we felt like a sleeker, more lightweight design would increase portability and make for a more flexible laptop.
We achieved this by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Splitting up the motherboard into a number of interconnected, specialized boards that take up less space and also make the laptop even more modular</li>
<li>Designing completely custom 18650 battery packs that tightly integrate electronics into the mechanical structure</li>
<li>Swapping the trackball for a trackpad</li>
<li>Adding three ultra low profile trackpad buttons with Cherry MX switches for a more convenient scrolling and clicking experience</li>
<li>Keeping our renowned mechanical keyboard with RGB backlight and Kailh Choc Switches</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://mntre.com/reform_next_images/nref-proto-detail-trackpad.jpg"><img src="https://mntre.com/reform_next_images/nref-proto-detail-trackpad.jpg" alt="MNT Reform Next Prototype, Trackpad" title="MNT Reform Next Prototype, Trackpad"></a></p>

<p>Not only did we manage to increase portability — we also wanted MNT Reform Next to be highly performant. Our latest compatible processor module, the <a href="https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform-rcore-rk3588-processor-module">RK3588</a>, makes it possible. It is suitable for software development, open source CAD/media work, and OpenGL 3.1 gaming and emulation. More benefits include:</p>

<ul>
<li>4x performant ARM Cortex-A76 cores (up to 2.4GHz)</li>
<li>4x power-efficient ARM Cortex-A55 cores (1.8GHz)</li>
<li>Powerful ARM Mali G610 MP4 GPU with <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/release-the-panthor.html">open source panthor</a> graphics driver </li>
<li>16 or 32 GB RAM</li>
<li>Dual display</li>
<li>Fast PCIe 3.0 + 2.0 and USB 3.0</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-we-build-sustainable-open-hardware-computers">Why We Build Sustainable Open Hardware Computers</h2>

<p>Lukas "minute" Hartmann started developing the very first MNT Reform open hardware laptop in 2017 — out of the frustration of closed hardware that is not repairable, not upgradeable, not future proof. Planned obsolescence has become the default and MNT Research opposes this hypercapitalist and destructive concept in any way possible. We don't want to add unnecessary waste to an environment that is already vulnerable. We don't want to add AI features that corrupt the system by creating misinformation and devaluing creative work. Instead, we want our users to have more freedom, we want them to actively contribute, we want to make open hardware the norm.</p>

<p>It is not an easy thing to do. As a very small company with only a handful of employees, we as MNT Research have to be very efficient in what we do. Since we want to stay independent and oppose venture capital, we are dependent on crowdfunding and grants to be able to develop and produce our devices (thanks to <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/pocket-reform">Crowd Supply</a> and <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/MNT-Reform-Next/">NLnet</a> for their ongoing cooperation). Producing and manufacturing only small amounts is very expensive, which is why we also depend on the system of preorders. Our products are build to last and we want to avoid compromises. This is also the reason why we don't have much wiggle room in terms of prices at this time.</p>

<p>In turn, you get a device that is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open Source Hardware, incl. sources and schematics</li>
<li>Customizable</li>
<li>Modular</li>
<li>Upgradeable</li>
<li>Future proof</li>
<li>Repairable and self-serviceable</li>
<li>Silent (no fan)</li>
</ul>

<p>Since we believe in the power of collaboration and communication, we have started an <a href="https://mntre.com/media/reform_md/community.mntre.com">MNT Community Forum</a> years ago, where our users can have an open dialog about MNT's devices, share their hacks and fixes, make suggestions, and ask questions. It is important to us to be in contact with you, our users. You keep us going and we are incredibly greatful for your ongoing support.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>Before we dive into all the technical details of MNT Reform Next, we want to give you an overview of the next steps.</p>

<p>MNT Reform Next is still at the prototype stage, but we are very happy that the device is booting and many features are already working. In the upcoming weeks, we will finalize the software as well as the hardware. The 3D printed case you can see in the photos will be replaced with a robust CNC-milled, bead-blasted, anodized 6061 aluminum case.</p>

<p>And, once more, there will be a crowdfunding campaign on <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/">Crowd Supply</a>. We are very excited to get the pre-launch page online. Expect more news on this later this week on the <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mntmn">Fediverse</a> and in the <a href="https://mntre.com/news.html">news section</a> on our website!</p>

<p>MNT Reform Next supports a <a href="https://mntre.com/modularity.html">variety of Processor Modules</a>. The standard module is the RCORE with 8-core Rockchip RK3588 processor and Mali G610 GPU: <a href="https://source.mnt.re/reform/mnt-reform-rk3588-som/#mnt-reform-rcore-rk3588-som">https://source.mnt.re/reform/mnt-reform-rk3588-som/#mnt-reform-rcore-rk3588-som</a></p>

<h2 id="port-boards">Port Boards</h2>

<p><a href="https://source.mnt.re/reform/reform-next/-/raw/main/images/reform-next-ports-overview.png"><img src="https://source.mnt.re/reform/reform-next/-/raw/main/images/reform-next-ports-overview.png" alt="MNT Reform Next ports overview in FreeCAD" title="MNT Reform Next ports overview in FreeCAD"></a></p>

<p>There three port boards in total on the left, right and back:</p>

<h3 id="port-board-one">Port Board One</h3>

<p>Port Board One is mounted on the left side of the case and is responsible for USB-C Power Delivery. When customizing this board, this functionality must be retained for powering the laptop. Copy the KiCAD source files as a starting point. There is a mechanical/spatial coupling with the keyboard that rests above the ports. Please take a look at the following drawing to see where the keyboard PCB is cut away. This defines the space that is available for ports. Any parts and connectors should not be taller than x mm above a 1.6mm PCB, because keycaps could collide with the components when being pressing down.</p>

<p><a href="https://source.mnt.re/reform/reform-next/-/raw/main/images/reform-next-ports-one-photo.jpg"><img src="https://source.mnt.re/reform/reform-next/-/raw/main/images/reform-next-ports-one-photo.jpg" alt="MNT Reform Next port board one" title="MNT Reform Next port board one"></a></p>

<p>Details:</p>

<ul>
<li>USB-C with USB 3.0 + 2.0 signaling and USB Power Delivery</li>
<li>1 GBit Ethernet (ix Industrial. Device will be shipped with a short ix to RJ45 jack dongle.)</li>
<li>MicroSD slot (bootable)</li>
<li>TLV320AIC3100 Soundchip with internal speaker driver/connector</li>
<li>Headset TRRS jack (stereo headphone driver and mono microphone support)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="port-board-two">Port Board Two</h3>

<p>Port Board Two is mounted on the right side of the case and mainly provides USB connectivity (3 ports), plus HDMI. Copy the KiCAD source files as a starting point. A similar mechanical/spatial coupling with the keyboard as with the Port Board One constrains the port placement, see the following drawing.</p>

<p><a href="https://source.mnt.re/reform/reform-next/-/raw/main/images/reform-next-ports-two-photo.jpg"><img src="https://source.mnt.re/reform/reform-next/-/raw/main/images/reform-next-ports-two-photo.jpg" alt="MNT Reform Next port board two" title="MNT Reform Next port board two"></a></p>

<p>Details:</p>

<ul>
<li>Full-size HDMI</li>
<li>2x USB-C with USB 3.0 + 2.0 signaling</li>
<li>1x USB-A with USB 3.0 + 2.0 signaling for legacy USB devices</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="port-board-three">Port Board Three</h3>

<p>Port Board Three hosts a Wi-Fi/BT chipset by default. It receives USB 2.0, SDIO and UART (with flow control) signals as well as 5V and 3V3 power from Processor Modules that support this (like the RCORE RK3588 module).</p>

<p>The default Wi-Fi/BT implementation is based around the Ezurio Sterling-LWB5+ Wi-Fi 5 with Bluetooth 5.2 SMT module. The chipset is Cypress CYW4373EUBGT, which has good Linux mainline driver support.</p>

<p>By default, this board doesn't expose any connectors to the outside. Instead, Wi-Fi/BT antennas are mounted on it, and the port cover is made from an RF transmissive material to allow for good reception. But you can customize this board while making use of the available space under/behind the keyboard to add external ports, like external antenna connectors, or back-facing USB.</p>

<p><a href="https://source.mnt.re/reform/reform-next/-/raw/main/images/reform-next-ports-three-iso.png"><img src="https://source.mnt.re/reform/reform-next/-/raw/main/images/reform-next-ports-three-iso.png" alt="MNT Reform Next port board three 3D view in FreeCAD" title="MNT Reform Next port board three 3D view in FreeCAD"></a></p>

<p>Details:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wi-Fi/BT chipset and antennas</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="area-below-the-keyboard">Area Below the Keyboard</h3>

<p>You have up to four millimeters of vertical space below the keyboard for extending port boards with low-profile components. 1 mm or 0.8 mm thick PCBs are recommended. You can also create boards that splice/transform/forward available FFC signals, such as USB (with hubs), I2C (with extenders), Ethernet (switch), etc. as long as they fit under the keyboard. There is some more space available between the through-hole pin rows of the keyboard. It is recommended to load your design as a STEP model into the provided FreeCAD laptop assembly file to check for any mechanical interference.</p>

<h2 id="internal-connectors">Internal connectors:</h2>

<ul>
<li>USB 3.0 + 2.0 to Port Board One</li>
<li>USB 3.0 + 2.0 to Port Board Two</li>
<li>1 GBit Ethernet</li>
<li>SD Card (4-bit)</li>
<li>I2S Audio</li>
<li>HDMI</li>
<li>Display Power and Backlight PWM</li>
<li>Serial UART for Debug</li>
<li>Power Interface incl. I2C (for USB-C PD or direct power)</li>
<li>2x redundant/parallel Battery Packs (Power, Alert and I2C)</li>
<li>Internal Keyboard Ports (USB and UART for standby mode)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="additional-features">Additional Features:</h2>

</ul></li>
<li>USB 2.0 hub

<ul>
<li>to provide enough internal USB 2.0 ports for input devices and RP2040 communication</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="power-system">Power System:</h2>

<ul>
<li>BQ25756 multi-chemistry charge buck/boost controller for 4S2P LiFePO4 or 4S2P Li-ion batteries</li>
<li>LM62460 for 6A of 5V power</li>
<li>LM62460 for 6A of 3.3V power</li>
<li>MAX1837EUT33+T for Standby 3v3 power</li>
</ul>

<p>All main power rails work, and i.MX8MPlus Reform Processor module was used to boot Linux, which was operable via serial console (UART 2):</p>

<p>The motherboard physically fits in the prototype 3D printed case from december 2023:</p>

<p><a href="https://source.mnt.re/reform/reform-next/-/raw/main/images/reform-next-proto-motherboard.jpg"><img src="https://source.mnt.re/reform/reform-next/-/raw/main/images/reform-next-proto-motherboard.jpg" alt="photo of MNT Reform Next motherboard in prototype" title="photo of MNT Reform Next motherboard in prototype"></a></p>

<h2 id="battery-system">Battery System</h2>

<p>In Reform Next, the battery packs have 4 user replacable 18650 cells in series each. The packs are connected to the motherboard in parallel, so they are fully redundant. They have their own monitoring and balancing circuits and abstract all measurements like cell voltages, current, and alert states digitally over I2C. The main buck/boost charger resides on the motherboard. The coordination of the packs, the charger, and the USB-C power delivery living on Port Board one are implemented centrally in free software running on the RP2040 microcontroller on the motherboard. The default chemistry of the cells is LiFePO4. The chemistry can be switched to Li-ion using DIP switches on the motherboard — this optional user choice trades longer runtime for less safety and environmental friendliness.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Nobody cares about security.</p>



<p>There. I said it. I said the thing everyone feels, some people think, but very few have the temerity to say out loud. But before you call me a blasphemous heathen, I will ask for just a few moments of your time to offer context. I even have some ideas and solutions.</p>



<p>When I say “Nobody cares about security,” I mean it in the same way I remind folks that nobody cares about backups. What they care about is RESTORES.</p>



<p>To quote my friend and colleague Tom LaRock, backups<a href="https://x.com/SQLRockstar/status/1636402827944771588"> are worthless. Restores are priceless.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, the thing we need is the ability to <strong><em>get our data back</em></strong> if something catastrophic happens. This means we need A) the data itself and B) the ability to restore it. In order to have those things, we must first perform backups, and we’re forced to perform them regularly. (And, I can’t emphasize enough, that those backups must be tested. Otherwise, you have <a href="https://orlybooks.com/books/schrodingers-backup">Schrodinger’s Backup</a> ). Over the decades that the IT industry has existed, we’ve consistently improved both the technology and techniques of backups, from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_rotation_scheme">“grandfather, father, son”</a> rotation scheme of the 80’s and 90’s to the <a href="https://www.purestorage.com/knowledge/3-2-1-backup-strategy.html">“3-2-1”</a> rule first used in 2009 and onward. We’ve done so NOT because we care about the backups themselves, but the sheer frequency of unexpected and catastrophic data loss events serve as both object lessons and cautionary tales that drive our willingness to invest effort and money in backups nevertheless.</p>



<p>So much so that, when some part of the organization questions the necessity (and the costs – from software to hardware to staff time) of backups, there’s usually a recent event that IT professionals can easily point to and say, “Remember how horrible that was? Remember the cost? We don’t want THAT to happen again, do we?” The ability to backup <em>and efficiently restore data</em> is an insurance policy that guards the company against even greater lost revenue.</p>



<h2>The opposite of love isn’t hate, it’s apathy</h2>



<p>This brings me back to my original point: Nobody (i.e., business leaders) cares about security. What they care about is avoiding lost revenue due to application downtime, extortion, and lawsuits.</p>



<p>Now, that’s a pretty hefty list, and one might think it’s more than enough to justify (almost) any cost of beefing up a company’s information security posture and capabilities.</p>



<p>But look at that list of consequences again and consider it from a purely business point of view. Each of those concerns can be addressed in other ways, from built-in redundancy to <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/small-businesses/cybersecurity/cyber-insurance">cyber liability insurance</a>. These mitigations are (or at least appear to be, from a business standpoint) less expensive than the investment needed to improve infosec.</p>



<p>What’s worse, many of you reading this will notice that I left two commonly cited consequences off my initial list: fines and damage to reputation. I did that because the prevailing attitude among business leaders is:</p>



<ul>
<li>Damage to the company’s reputation SOUNDS bad, but (so the thinking goes) it’s really too amorphous to quantify. Plus, many companies in recent memory were the victims of massive cyber attacks, took a hit to their reputation or stock price, but saw it rebound a week later with no other ill effects. (again, that’s the belief. More on this later)</li>



<li>The fines currently in place appear to be lower than the expected cost to improve the company’s security posture.</li>
</ul>



<p>However, the financial bottom line is only part of the reason businesses ignore their information needs. The other reasons are equally challenging to address:</p>



<p>Infosec issues are, almost by their very nature, complex. They are certainly more complex than having up-to-date backups. They might be more complex than any other category of risk the company will face. Cyber threats are constantly changing and expensive to preemptively address. There’s usually no single “right” answer to “How much infosec do we need?”</p>



<p>To put it another way, the broad answer to addressing both the issue of backups and infosec is that one needs to establish healthy habits. But the habits for backups are akin to remembering to brush your teeth in the morning. Important, but straightforward. Whereas the habits needed for proper information hygiene are akin to making healthy heart choices: the path to optimizing your cardiovascular health might involve not just one but a range of habits – from eating healthy foods (and avoiding unhealthy ones) to getting the right amount of exercise and sleep. But even within those broad instructions lie a range of nuances. What, exactly, are “healthy foods”? (Organic? Low-starch? Unprocessed? Keto friendly?) What type of exercise will be most effective? (Cardio? Weight training? Crossfit?) Underlying all of those variations is the very real chance that none of it may help – not because the person isn’t committed, but because there are so many other factors – from age to genetics to individual metabolism – that it still might not work. And even after adjusting for every single other variable, there’s the genuine possibility that a person can do everything right and still succumb to some other disease or physical failure.</p>



<p>That last point – that despite our health goals, we may still have health problems – is far closer to the reality of infosec than many readers might realize. A few years ago, Cisco CEO John Chambers stated, <em>“There are only two types of companies: those that have been hacked and those who don’t know they’ve been hacked yet.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><a href="http://cybercure.com/">Abe Silber, CEO at CyberCure.com</a>, succinctly identified the core issue:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“The problem with security is that it’s impossible to measure your ROI. Even if we can measure the cost of a security incident (not an easy task) it’s almost impossible to measure the likelihood of preventing them (hence ROI) based on different security solutions. So it’s not that business people don’t care. It’s that we (IT practitioners) have no way to show them what they get for their money. If I spend x amount on honeypots, how less likely am I to get hacked?</em></p>



<p><em>(We can try to make the case that) Security helps you not lose money, like insurance. But unlike insurance, it’s not guaranteed protection. I can tell you firsthand that it’s easier to sell a CEO a $25,000 cyber insurance policy than a $10,000 security solution.”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<h2>This is only the beginning.</h2>



<p>In my next post I’ll start to propose a way forward – a set of actionable decisions you (and your company) can make to get people to not only care about security, but to support and participate in healthy security behaviors. </p>



<p>In the meantime, if you want to share your own ideas, I’d love to hear them in the comments below.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><h2>Very few think the world is making progress. In this article, we look at the history of global living conditions and show that the world has made immense progress in important aspects.</h2><div><div><p>Originally published on December 14, 2016 (last partial update and revision in February 2024)</p></div><p><a href="#article-citation">Cite this article</a><a href="#article-licence">Reuse our work freely</a></p></div></header><p><span>We are working on Our World in Data to provide </span><em><span>‘research and data to make progress against the world’s largest problems.’</span></em></p><p><span>Our mission only makes sense if it is in fact possible to make progress against the large problems the world faces. Very few think the world is making progress. A 2015 </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/app/uploads/2016/12/Optimistic-about-the-future-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>survey</span></a><span>, long before the circumstances of the pandemic, asked, “All things considered, do you think the world is getting better or worse, or neither getting better nor worse?” In Sweden, 10% thought things are getting better, in the US they were only 6%, and in Germany only 4%.</span></p><p><span>What is the evidence that we need to consider when answering this question?</span></p><p><span>The question is how the world has changed, so we must take a historical perspective. And the question is about the world as a whole, so the answer must, therefore, consider everybody. The answer must consider the history of global living conditions — a history of everyone.</span></p><hr><h2 id="poverty"><span>Poverty</span><a href="#poverty"></a></h2><p><span>Global poverty is one of the very largest problems in the world today. Is it possible to make progress against this problem? To see where we are coming from, we must go far back in time. 30 or even 50 years are not enough. When you only consider what the world looked like during our lifetime, it is easy to think of the world as static&nbsp;— the richer parts of the world here and the poorer regions there — and to falsely conclude that it always was like that and will always be like that.</span></p><p><span>Take a longer perspective and it becomes clear that the world is not static at all. We can change the world. The countries that are rich today </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/breaking-the-malthusian-trap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>were very poor</span></a><span> just a few generations ago.</span></p><p><span>To avoid portraying the world in a static way, we have to start 200 years ago, before the&nbsp;time when&nbsp;living conditions really changed dramatically.</span></p><p><span>The United Nations focus on 'extreme poverty', an extremely low poverty line that has the purpose to draw attention to the very poorest people in the world.</span></p><p><span>The chart below shows long-run estimates of global poverty, published by the historian Michail Moatsos. These poverty figures take into account non-monetary forms of income — for poor families today and in the past, this is important, as many of them are subsistence farmers who live largely from their own food production. These poverty estimates also take into account different price levels in different countries. It is, of course, also adjusted for price changes over time (inflation). As a consequence of these adjustments, this data is expressed in 'international dollar'. One international dollar has the same purchasing power as one US dollar had in the US in 2011.</span></p><p><span>The chart shows that almost 10% of the world's population live in extreme poverty. It also tells us that two hundred years ago, the same was true for almost 80% of the world’s population. In 1820, only a small elite enjoyed higher standards of living, while the vast majority of people lived in conditions that we call extreme poverty today. Since then, the share of extremely poor people fell continuously. More and more world regions industrialized and </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-is-economic-growth"><span>achieved economic growth</span></a><span> which made it possible to lift more people out of poverty: In 1950 about half the world were living in extreme poverty; in 1990, it was still more than a third. By 2019 the share of the world population in extreme poverty has fallen below 10%.</span></p><p><span>The world is also making progress against poverty relative to higher poverty lines, as this visualization shows. In fact, no matter what poverty line you choose, the share of people below that poverty line </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/distribution-of-population-between-different-poverty-thresholds-up-to-30-dollars?stackMode=relative"><span>has declined</span></a><span> globally.</span></p><p><span>That is a huge achievement. For me, as a researcher who focuses on growth and inequality, it may be humanity’s biggest achievement in the last two centuries. It is particularly remarkable if we consider that the world population has increased </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>7-fold</span></a><span> over the last two centuries — via the chart’s settings, you can switch this chart to see the </span><em><span>number</span></em><span> of people in and out of poverty. In a world without </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>economic growth</span></a><span>, a 7-fold increase of the population would have resulted in less and less income for everyone, it would have driven everyone into extreme poverty. Yet, the exact opposite happened. In a time of unprecedented population growth, our world managed to give more prosperity to more people and to lift more and more people out of the worst poverty.</span></p><p><span>Increasing productivity was important because it made vital goods and services less scarce: </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-per-person" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>more food</span></a><span>, better clothing, and less cramped housing. Productivity is the ratio between the output of our work and the input that we put in our work; as productivity increased, we benefitted from more output, but also from less input — weekly working hours </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/working-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>fell very substantially</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Economic growth was also important because it changed the relationship between people. In the long time in which the world lived in a non-growth world the only way to become better off was </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/breaking-the-malthusian-trap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>for someone else to get&nbsp;worse off</span></a><span>. It was a zero-sum economy. Your own good luck was your neighbor's bad luck. Economic growth changed that. Growth made it possible for you to get better off while others become better off, too. The ingenuity of those who built the technology that increased productivity — modern transportation, production machinery, and communication technology — made some of them very rich and at the same time, it increased the productivity and the incomes of others. It is hard to overstate how different life is in zero-sum and positive-sum economies.</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately the media is overly obsessed with reporting single events and with things that go wrong&nbsp;and does not nearly pay enough attention to the slow developments that reshape our world. With this empirical data on the reduction of poverty, we can make concrete what a&nbsp;media that would report global&nbsp;development would look like. The headline could be&nbsp;"The number of people in extreme poverty fell by 130,000 since yesterday” and they wouldn’t have this headline once, but </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/poverty?insight=global-extreme-poverty-declined-substantially-over-the-last-generation#key-insights-on-poverty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>every single day</span></a><span> since 1990, since, on average, there were 130,000 people fewer in extreme poverty every day. If you prefer to rely on a higher poverty line, the numbers are even more impressive. The daily headline would point out that the number of people living on more than $10 per day increased by a quarter of a million on any average </span><em><span>day</span></em><span> in the last decade.</span></p><p><span>It is important to know that it is possible to make progress against poverty because, despite two centuries of progress, poverty remains one of the very largest problems in the world. The majority of the world population </span><em><span>still</span></em><span> lives in poverty: Almost every tenth person lives in extreme poverty, and two-thirds live on less than $10 per day. In rich countries, a person is </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/higher-poverty-global-line" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>considered poor</span></a><span> when she or he lives on less than $30 per day; if we rely on this poverty definition, then we find that 85% of the world lives in poverty.</span><a href="#note-1"><sup><span>1</span></sup></a><span> </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/poverty-growth-needed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Much</span></a><span> more progress is needed.</span></p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Since the publication of this article, the UN has updated their measurement of extreme poverty and the World Bank has updated its poverty data. See the note at the end for more information.</span></p><hr><h2 id="literacy"><span>Literacy</span><a href="#literacy"></a></h2><p><span>How did the education of the world population change over this period? This chart shows the increasing share of the world population that is able to read and write. Today’s education — including in today’s richest countries — is again a very recent achievement. Only in the last two centuries did literacy become the norm for the entire population.</span></p><p><span>In 1820, only every tenth person older than 15 years was literate; in 1930, it was every third, and now we are at 87% globally. Put differently, if you were alive in 1800, there was a chance of 9 in 10 that you weren’t able to read; today, close to 9 out of 10 people are able to read. And among today's young population, the chances are much higher since many of today’s illiterate population are </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/literacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>old</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>If you think science, technology, and political freedom are important to solve the world’s large problems and you think that it helps to read and write to solve problems, then consider the figures in absolute numbers. Today, there are about 5.1 billion people who can read and write.</span><a href="#note-2"><sup><span>2</span></sup></a><span> In 1800, there were fewer than 100 million people with the same skill.</span></p><hr><h2 id="health"><span>Health</span><a href="#health"></a></h2><p><span>One reason why we do not see progress is that we are unaware of how bad the past was.</span></p><p><span>The chart here shows that in 1800, the health conditions were such that around 43% of the world’s newborns died before their fifth birthday. The historical estimates suggest that the entire world lived in poor conditions, so that there was little variation between different regions, in all countries of the world more than every third child died before it was five years old.</span></p><p><span>When considering the entirety of childhood — not just up to the age of five, but until the end of puberty — then we find that around </span><em><span>half</span></em><span> of all children died in the past (see </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-in-the-past" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>my article</span></a><span> on this data).</span></p><p><span>It would be wrong to believe that modern medicine was the only reason for improved health. Initially, </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>rising prosperity</span></a><span>, public health interventions, and the changing nature of social life mattered more than medicine. Improvements in housing and </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/sanitation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>sanitation</span></a><span> improved our chances in the age-old war against infectious disease. Healthier diets — made possible through </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/agricultural-employment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>higher productivity</span></a><span> in the agricultural sector and </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/international-trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>overseas trade</span></a><span> — made us more resilient against disease. Improving nutrition and health also made us </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/human-height/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>taller</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Science and medicine mattered as well. A more educated population achieved a series of scientific breakthroughs that made it possible to reduce mortality and disease further. Particularly important was the discovery of the germ theory of disease in the second half of the 19th century.&nbsp;In retrospect, it is hard to understand why a new theory could possibly be so critical. But at a time when doctors </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/measurement-matters-the-decline-of-maternal-mortality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>did not wash their hands</span></a><span> when switching from post-mortems to midwifery, the theory was crucial in convincing our ancestors that hygiene and public sanitation are essential for health.</span></p><p><span>The germ theory of disease laid&nbsp;the foundation for the development of antibiotics and vaccines, allowing humanity to finally gain some ground in </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/microbes-battle-science-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>the age-old battle</span></a><span> against the microbes. Public health mattered hugely: Everybody benefits when everybody else is </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>vaccinated</span></a><span>, and everybody benefits from everybody else obeying the rules of hygiene.</span></p><p><span>With these changes, global health improved in a way that was unimaginable to our ancestors. In 2021 </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>child mortality</span></a><span> was down to 4% — 10-fold lower than two centuries ago.</span></p><p><span>The same data on child mortality also shows us just how large of a problem child mortality still is. On average, </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-everyday-tragedy-no-headlines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>15,000 children die</span></a><span> every day. More progress is urgently needed and, as our history suggests, possible.</span></p><p><span>You have to take this long perspective to see the progress that we have achieved. It is just hard to imagine how bad the living conditions in the past were.</span></p><hr><h2 id="freedom"><span>Freedom</span><a href="#freedom"></a></h2><p><span>Political freedom and civil liberties are at the very heart of development because they </span><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/163962/development-as-freedom-by-amartya-sen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>are</span></a><span> both a means for development and an end of development.</span></p><p><span>Merely qualitative assessments of these aspects&nbsp;bear the risk that we are mistakingly&nbsp;perceiving a decline of liberties over time when, in fact, we are raising the bar by which we judge our freedom and liberty. This is why quantitative assessments can be useful. They can help us to measure freedom against the same yardstick across countries and over time.</span></p><p><span>There are various attempts to measure the types of political regimes that govern the world’s countries. To capture something as complex as a political system is necessarily controversial. There is just no way around that. In this analysis, I rely on the assessment by Svend-Erik Skaaning, John Gerring, and Henrikas Bartusevičius for a very long-term perspective of political regimes around the world.</span><a href="#note-3"><sup><span>3</span></sup></a></p><p><span>My colleague Bastian Herre has brought together many other datasets that assess and classify political regimes around the world.

The share of the world population living in democracies increased from 25% in 1950 to 35% in 1980.

It is worrying, however, that the share living in democracies has not increased in recent years.</span></p><p><span>Over the long-run the evidence is clear. While every generation was pessimistic that democracies can last, it should have been the autocrats who needed to worry. Autocratic rulers lost their power in more and more places over the last two centuries.

First of all, this increase shows a tremendous achievement. It shows that humans stopped dying at the rate at which our ancestors died for the many millennia before.</span></p><p><span>In pre-modern times, </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>fertility</span></a><span> was high — 5 or 6 children per woman were the norm. What kept the population growth low was the very high rate at which people died, and that meant that many children&nbsp;were dead before they reached their reproductive age. The increase of the world population followed when humanity started to win the fight against death. Life expectancy </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>doubled</span></a><span> in all world regions.</span></p><p><span>Population growth is a </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#why-is-rapid-population-growth-a-temporary-phenomenon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>temporary phenomenon</span></a><span>, it is the consequence of fertility and mortality not declining simultaneously. The fast population growth happened when fertility was still as high as it was in the unhealthy environment of the past, but mortality has already declined to the low levels of our time.</span></p><p><span>What we have </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility/#when-more-children-survive-fertility-decreases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>seen</span></a><span> in country after country over the last 200 years is that when women gain more independence, education, and prosperity and realize that the chances of their children dying declined, they choose to have fewer children. Rapid population growth comes to an end. This transition from high mortality and high fertility to low mortality and low fertility is called the </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#why-is-rapid-population-growth-a-temporary-phenomenon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>demographic transition</span></a><span>. In those countries that industrialized first, it lasted at least from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century — it took 95 years for fertility to decline from above six children to less than three children per woman in the UK. Countries that followed later often achieved this transition much </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility/#fertility-can-decline-extremely-fast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>faster</span></a><span>: South Korea went from more than six children per woman to less than three in just 18 years, and Iran even went through it in only ten years.</span></p><p><span>Just as countries went through this transition, so is the world going through it. Global fertility has </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#the-global-decline-of-the-fertility-rate-since-1950" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>more than halved</span></a><span> in the last 50 years, from more than 5 children per woman in the early 1960s to below 2.5 today. This means that the world is well into the demographic transition and the global population growth rate has in fact </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#how-has-the-world-population-growth-rate-changed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>peaked</span></a><span> half a century ago.</span></p><p><span>Now that we </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>see</span></a><span> fertility declining in countries around the world, we approach </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth-past-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>the end of global population growth</span></a><span>: The global population has quadrupled over the course of the 20th century — this century, it is not expected to double. The UN demographers </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/future-population-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>expect</span></a><span> population growth to end before the end of this century.</span><a href="#note-5"><sup><span>5</span></sup></a></p><hr><h2 id="education"><span>Education</span><a href="#education"></a></h2><p><span>None of the achievements over the last two centuries could have been made without the expansion of knowledge and education. The revolution in how we live was not only driven by education, but it also made education more important than ever.</span></p><p><span>Contrary to many other social aspects where forecasts are of limited use, I think education is an aspect where we can make some useful projections. The simple reason is that the educational composition today tells us something about the education of tomorrow&nbsp;— a literate young woman today will be a literate old woman in 2080.</span></p><p><span>As we've seen before, education — measured by the essential skill of literacy — has already improved. And we know that it will continue as the younger cohort today is&nbsp;</span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>much better educated</span></a><span> than people in older cohorts.</span></p><p><span>This visualization shows the projection of the IIASA demographers for the size and the educational composition of the world population until 2100. It is an interesting look into the future: With today’s lower global fertility, the researchers expect that the number of children will decline from now — there will never be more children on the planet than today. As mentioned, before demographers expect the world population to peak in the second half of this century and to decline thereafter.</span></p><p><span>Focusing on the educational breakdown the projection suggests that by 2100, there will be almost no one without formal education and there will be more than 7 billion minds who will have received at least secondary education.</span></p><p><span>With the great importance of education for improving health, increasing political freedom, and ending poverty, this prospect is very encouraging.</span></p><hr><h2 id="why-do-we-not-know-how-our-world-is-changing"><span>Why do we not know how our world is changing?</span><a href="#why-do-we-not-know-how-our-world-is-changing"></a></h2><p><span>The motivation for this history of global living conditions was the survey result that documented the negative perspective on global development that most of us have. More than 9 out of 10 people do not think that the world is getting better. How does that fit with the empirical evidence?</span></p><p><span>I do not believe that the media are the only ones to blame, but I do think that they are to blame for some part of this.&nbsp;This is because the&nbsp;media does not tell us how the world is changing, it tells us what in the world goes wrong.</span></p><p><span>One reason the media focuses on things that go wrong is that the media focuses on single events, and single events are often bad — look at the news: plane crashes, terrorism attacks, natural disasters. Positive developments, on the other hand, often happen very slowly and never make the headlines.</span></p><p><span>The result of a media —&nbsp;and education system — that fails to present quantitative information on long-run developments is that most people are </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wrong-about-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>very ignorant</span></a><span> about global development and have little hope that progress against serious problems is even possible.</span></p><p><span>Even the decline of global extreme poverty — by any standard one of the most crucial developments in our lifetime — is only known by a small fraction of the population of the UK (10%) or the US (5%). In both countries, the majority of people think that the share of people living in extreme poverty has increased. Two thirds in the US even think the share in extreme poverty has ‘almost doubled.’ When we are ignorant about the basic facts about global development it is not&nbsp;surprising&nbsp;that we have a negative view of our times and that few have the hope that the world can get better.</span></p><p><span>The only way to tell a history of everyone is to use statistics. Only then can we hope to get an overview of the lives of the 22 billion people that lived in the last 200 years. The&nbsp;developments that these statistics reveal transform our global living conditions — slowly but steadily. They are reported in&nbsp;this online publication — </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Our World in Data</span></a><span> — that my team and I have been building over the last few years. We see it as a resource to show these long-term developments and thereby complement the information in the news that focus on events.</span></p><p><span>The difficulty in telling the history of how everyone’s lives changed over the last 200 years is that you cannot pick single stories. Stories about individual people are much more engaging — our minds like these stories — but they cannot be representative for how the world has changed. To&nbsp;achieve a representation of how the world has changed at large, you have to tell many, many stories all at once; and that is statistics.</span></p><p><span>To make it easier for myself and for you to understand the transformation in living conditions that we have achieved, I made a summarizing visualization in which I imagine this 200-year history as the history of a group of 100 people to see how the lives of them would have changed if they lived through this transformative period of the modern world. It shows at once some of the very largest problems we face and the progress that the last generations have made.</span></p><figure><picture><source srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/World-as-100-people-2024_48.png 48w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/World-as-100-people-2024_100.png 100w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/World-as-100-people-2024_350.png 350w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/World-as-100-people-2024_850.png 850w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/World-as-100-people-2024_1350.png 1350w, https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/World-as-100-people-2024_3670.png 3670w" type="image/png" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 95vw, (min-width: 960px) 853px"><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/World-as-100-people-2024.png" alt="A summary visualization that shows how the world has changed over the last two centuries — poverty is down, education up, child mortality down, democracy" loading="lazy" width="3670" height="2442"></picture><figcaption><span>The world as 100 people over the last two centuries</span></figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="why-it-matters-that-we-do-not-know-how-our-world-is-changing"><span>Why it matters that we do not know how our world is changing</span><a href="#why-it-matters-that-we-do-not-know-how-our-world-is-changing"></a></h2><p><span>A single person can't change the world. The transformation of our living conditions was possible only because of collaboration. It is our collective brains and our collaborative effort that are needed for such a revolution.</span></p><p><span>There are big problems that remain. None of the above&nbsp;should give us reason to become complacent. On the contrary, it shows us that a lot of work still needs to be done — accomplishing the fastest reduction of extreme poverty is an important achievement, but the fact that 85% of the world live on less than $30 per day is unacceptable. We also must not&nbsp;accept the restrictions of our liberty that remain. It is also clear that humanity’s impact on the environment is at a level that is not sustainable and is endangering the biosphere and climate on which we depend. We urgently need to reduce our impact, and on Our World in Data, you can find detailed information about the world's environmental problems.</span></p><p><span>It is far from certain that we will make progress against these problems — there is no iron law that would ensure that the world continues this trend of improving living conditions. However, what is evident from the long-term perspective is that progress is possible and that the last 200 years have brought us to a better position than ever before to solve problems. Solving problems — big problems — is always a collaborative undertaking. The group of people that can work together today is a much stronger group than ever existed on this planet. Healthier, richer, and better educated.</span></p><p><span>For our history to be a source of encouragement, however, we have to know our history. The story that we tell ourselves about our history and our time matters. Because our hopes and efforts for building a better future are inextricably linked to our perception of the past it is important to understand and communicate the global development up to now. An understanding of our efforts and our fellow humans is a vital condition to the fruitfulness of our endeavors. Knowing that we have come a long way in improving living conditions and the notion that our work is worthwhile is to us all what self-respect is to individuals. It is a necessary condition for improvement.</span></p><p><span>Freedom is impossible without faith in free people. And if we are not aware of our history and falsely believe the opposite of what is true, we risk losing faith in each other.</span></p><hr><div><h4 id="note-the-world-bank-has-updated-its-poverty-and-inequality-data-since-the-publication-of-this-article"><span>Note: The World Bank has updated its poverty and inequality data since the publication of this article</span></h4><p><span>The data in this article uses a previous release of the World Bank's poverty and inequality data in which incomes are expressed in 2011 international-$.</span></p><p><span>The World Bank has since updated its methods, and now measures incomes in 2017 international-$.

		<p><strong>Update:</strong> ESPN updated its recap of the match to include a mention of Alex Morgan at 8:59 a.m. ET on Monday, Sept. 9.</p>
<p>U.S. soccer legend Alex Morgan played her final professional match on Sunday, a 4-1 loss by her San Diego Wave to the North Carolina Courage.</p>

<p>The match, which was <a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/nwsl/alex-morgan-final-match-wave-simulcast-cbs-espn-prime.html">simulcast across various networks and streaming services</a>, included a beautiful moment in which Morgan removed her cleats at midfield and <a href="https://twitter.com/espn/status/1832941203278450834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1832941203278450834%7Ctwgr%5Ee1d1d34319b7d851aa8409a188dafa5dc1967526%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsports.yahoo.com%2Falex-morgan-bids-emotional-farewell-in-final-game-of-her-soccer-career-013942733.html">tearfully waved to a Snapdragon Stadium crowd</a> that chanted her name while players surrounded and applauded her. After the match, in which she played 15 minutes and took a penalty kick, she spoke to the crowd to thank them for their support and say goodbye.</p>
<p>You’d never know any of that from the post-match report by ESPN Generative AI Services, which began providing recaps of National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) and the Premier Lacrosse League (PLL) games this week.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/report/_/gameId/697990">recap</a>, which was posted to ESPN’s website and apps at 8:52 pm ET, provides a standard rundown of the outcome before going into who scored goals and how the action played out. Nowhere in the 215-word recap is Morgan mentioned, let alone the fact that this was the two-time World Cup winner and Olympic gold medalist’s final pro match.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">No mention of Alex Morgan at all in ESPN’s AI-generated recap of the final game of her professional career.</p>
<p>The article did provide analysis on the performance of her teammate Kennedy Wesley, noting that she contributed “defensively as well as on offense” in Sunday’s game. <a href="https://t.co/bKpuGmfaSK">pic.twitter.com/bKpuGmfaSK</a></p>

<p>The recap did note that “[San Diego’s Kennedy] Wesley was the standout player, contributing defensively as well as on offense.”</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/tech/ai-moves-espn-tennis-channel-recaps-translation.html">announcement of the service</a>, ESPN made a point to note that “each AI-generated recap will be reviewed by a human editor to ensure quality and accuracy.” It’s unclear if the human editor failed to notice Morgan’s absence or also decided it was not worth mentioning.</p>

<p>You could certainly make the case that everything in the recap is accurate from a factual perspective. However, the fact that it doesn’t include any information about Morgan and how important this night was for her, the NWSL, and U.S. women’s soccer speaks to how these kinds of services can’t replicate human writers who can see an event from a 360-degree perspective.</p>
<p>ESPN did post a <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/41185132/alex-morgan-exits-final-game-early-san-diego">separate article on their outlets from writer Jeff Kassouf</a> that is all about Morgan and the emotional night. However, that article is located on the side menu of the AI-generated recap and is easy to miss.</p>

<p>ESPN says that the “AI-generated recaps aim to enhance coverage of under-served sports, providing fans with content that was previously unavailable.”</p>
<p>That begs a question. If you’re going to provide fans of underserved sports with poorly written recaps that don’t tell the full story, <a href="https://awfulannouncing.com/tech/ai-moves-espn-tennis-channel-recaps-translation.html">what value are you really providing them</a>?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Synthetic diamonds are now purer, more beautiful, and vastly cheaper than mined diamonds. Beating nature took decades of hard graft and millions of pounds of pressure.</p><article><div role="presentation"><p>A diamond – from the Greek ἀδάμας (<!-- --><em>adámas</em>), meaning <!-- --><em>unconquerable</em> – is a three-dimensional cubic or hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms. As its bonds are strong and its atoms packed closely together, diamond is the hardest natural material and the least compressible. Diamonds have high thermal conductivity and high electrical resistivity, but can be combined with small amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and boron and made into semiconductors. A diamond’s surface does not easily stick to other materials, but moves smoothly against them. Diamonds are chemically inert and not toxic to living tissue. In their pure form, diamonds are colorless and have a high dispersion of light, but the presence of certain impurities can add magnificent color to diamond gemstones.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>In nature, it takes billions of years to form a diamond. Most of the diamonds nature produces are too impure for jewelry or high-tech industry, and extracting them is costly and dirty. In the lab, diamonds can be made faster, purer, and cheaper, overcoming these problems and making possible new uses for diamonds that were previously unattainable.</p>



<!-- --><p>Scientists first manufactured diamonds in laboratories in the 1950s, imitating the conditions under which diamonds were produced in nature. The diamonds produced were initially small and impure and so useful only in low-tech industrial products such as abrasives and lubricants. Since then, diamond manufacturing technology has progressed: the generation process has become more controlled, new methods have been invented, and better catalysts have been discovered. Diamonds grown in the lab are now cheaper than mined diamonds and have superior physical, optical, chemical, and electrical properties. Consequently, they dominate the industrial market. In the past decade, diamond manufacturing technology progressed so much that it is now possible to mass-produce jewelry-quality diamonds in the lab. These lab diamonds are cheaper and more beautiful than mined diamonds. A perfectly cut, flawless lab diamond costs a fraction of the price of a mined diamond of lesser quality.</p>



<!-- --><p>Lab diamonds are a testament to the principle that what nature can do, man is capable of doing better.</p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>How diamonds are made</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>In 1773, in a series of experiments in the gardens of the Louvre, the French chemist Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier placed diamonds into a glass bell jar and then immersed the base of the jar in water.<!-- --><sup id="ref-1"></sup> Using a large, biconvex lens that measured 89 centimeters and weighed over 70 kilograms – the Palais-Royal burning glass – Lavoisier would concentrate the sun’s rays onto a diamond. Within minutes, the diamond on which the lens had been focused would evaporate completely; the others would blacken and lose mass.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>In his <!-- --><a href="http://www.lavoisier.cnrs.fr/ice/ice_book_detail.php?lang=fr&amp;type=text&amp;bdd=lavosier&amp;table=Lavoisier&amp;bookId=6&amp;typeofbookId=5&amp;num=0">Memoir on the Destruction of the Diamond by Fire</a> Lavoisier recounts that these experiments had been conducted in ‘clear and serene’ weather, but on 14 August 1773 a light fog reduced the sun’s power. In the more moderate heat, the diamonds in the jar appeared ‘precisely as if they had been coated with black smoke in the flame of a lamp’, causing Lavoisier to conclude that diamond is susceptible to be reduced to coal – <!-- --><em>charbon</em> – in certain circumstances. Overturning the jar and pouring inside limewater before the air escaped, Lavoisier observed that a chalky substance was precipitated when both diamonds and coal were burned. However, he did not conclude that diamond and coal are the same substance, only that both are combustible bodies.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>In his 1789 <!-- --><em>Elementary Treatise on Chemistry</em>, Lavoisier proposed that there exist basic chemical building blocks, of which carbon – from the Latin <!-- --><em>carbo</em>, meaning coal – is one. He would not live long enough to discover that diamond is an allotrope (a different physical form of the same element) of carbon.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>In the senseless bloodshed that characterized the French Revolution, Lavoisier, who had also been a <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferme_g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale">tax farmer</a>, was accused of adulterating tobacco and defrauding the state. He was guillotined on 8 May 1794. An apocryphal story holds that in response to an appeal to spare his life so that he could continue his experiments, the Revolutionary judge Jean-Baptiste Coffinhal declared that ‘The Republic needs neither scholars nor chemists; the course of justice cannot be impeded’. Coffinhal himself would be executed for his brutality three months later, but the damage had already been done. As Lavoisier’s colleague, the mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange, mourned, ‘It took them only an instant to cut off this head, and one hundred years might not suffice to reproduce its like’.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Instead, <!-- --><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/106919">the discovery that diamond is carbon</a> would be made by the English chemist Smithson Tennant, in 1796. Tennant heated ‘two grains and a half’ (162 milligrams) of diamonds in a closed gold tube containing niter (potassium nitrate, KNO<!-- --><sub>3</sub>). When heated, the potassium nitrate released oxygen, increasing its concentration, so that the diamonds burned faster, and at a lower temperature. Tennant kept the gold tube ‘in a strong red heat’ for an hour and a half, after which the diamonds were completely burned. The reaction produced ‘fixed air’ (carbon dioxide). Extracting and measuring the carbon dioxide produced, Tennant noted that it had occupied the space of ‘a little more than 10.1 ounces [354 milliliters] of water’.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>In the <!-- --><em>Memoirs</em> of the Royal Academy of Sciences for 1781, Lavoisier had published the <!-- --><a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k35800/f578.item">results of a series of experiments</a> in which he identified that ‘carbonic acid’ (carbon dioxide) contains 28.22 parts of ‘charcoal’ (carbon) for every 71.78 parts of ‘acidifying principle’ (oxygen) and, at similar temperatures and pressures to the air in Tennant’s laboratory, determined its weight to be 0.695 Parisian grains per cubic Paris inch (1.86 grams per liter). Using these measurements, Tennant computed that the carbon dioxide produced by burning an equal weight of charcoal ‘ought to occupy very nearly the bulk of 10 ounces [352 milliliters] of water’.<!-- --><sup id="ref-2"></sup></p>



<!-- --><p>On the basis that the quantity of carbon dioxide produced from burning equal weights of diamond and charcoal ‘does not differ much’, Tennant concluded that diamond ‘consists entirely of charcoal’. This astonishing result would be met with skepticism for two decades, until other scientists reproduced his results.</p>



<!-- --><p>Tennant had demonstrated that diamond is an allotrope of carbon, but diamond’s method of formation remained unknown. Motivated by the prospect of discovery and the allure of riches, nineteenth-century alchemists tried to turn charcoal into diamond by various means, including evaporation, explosions, and intense heat. None met with success.</p>



<!-- --><p>The most important of these researchers was the French chemist Henri Moissan. In 1886, Moissan succeeded in isolating the chemical element fluorine by means of electrolysis; for this, and for his research into high-temperature chemistry, he would win the 1906 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. <!-- --><a href="https://archive.org/details/electricfurnace00moisrich/page/n5/mode/2up">Considering the problem of synthesizing diamonds</a>, Moissan tested different forms of carbon – burnt sugar, charcoal, <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_carbon">gas carbon</a>, and <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_black">carbon black</a> – under the high heat of an electric arc furnace. In each of these experiments, the carbon would be converted into graphite, a different allotrope of carbon.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Moissan examined the geological records from sites where diamonds had been discovered – the alluvial sands of Brazil, the diamond pits of southern Africa, and the Canyon Diablo meteorite in Arizona – and made two important observations. First, he noticed that the diamonds of southern Africa, which were contained in<!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberlite"> rock that had been ‘thrust up . . . from the deeper layers of the earth’</a>, must have formed deep underground – ‘and thus pressure must have played a part at the moment of formation’.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Second, the diamonds that were discovered had not been attached to the ground in which they were buried; instead, they appeared as if they had formed ‘in the midst of a liquid’. Carbon, including diamond, dissolves easily in iron, and iron is frequently found near diamond sites, including the Canyon Diablo meteorite, where two small diamonds had been found in the middle of an iron mass. ‘In this case’, Moissan noted, ‘nature seems to have been caught in the act’.</p>



<!-- --><p>The Canyon Diablo meteorite suggested how diamonds might form. Molten iron that contains dissolved carbon might cool suddenly, ‘due to some cause or other’, causing it to contract ‘violently’, pressurizing the dissolved carbon to crystallize into diamonds. To replicate this process in his lab, Moissan heated crucibles containing iron and burnt sugar to 3,000°C and then quenched them in cooler substances: water, iron filings, and molten lead. In the residues, under a microscope, he discovered dense fragments of carbon, some black, others transparent, that scratched rubies, combusted in oxygen, and had ‘a very distinct crystalline appearance’. Moissan measured the relative density of these fragments to be 3.5 (compared to water) and observed that when burnt in oxygen at 900°C they yielded 3.666 grams of carbon dioxide per gram of substance. ‘These properties’, he declared, ‘are possessed by the natural diamond alone’.</p>

<!-- --><p>Moissan would go to his death in 1907 believing that he had synthesized diamonds. Other chemists, including Henry Louis Le Chatelier, were skeptical and his experiments did not replicate. The German chemist Otto Ruff and the English engineer Sir Charles Parsons separately believed that they had reproduced his results, only to repudiate their findings after more careful examination. Moissan’s widow would later tell Parsons that she believed one of Moissan’s assistants had introduced natural diamond fragments into the experiments ‘in order to please the old man’. Nonetheless, despite his failure, Henri Moissan was correct to believe that diamonds could be synthesized under a combination of high pressure and high temperature, catalyzed by a metal solvent.<!-- --><sup id="ref-3"></sup></p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>High pressure, high temperature</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>In 1950, the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady, New York, assembled a consortium of chemists, physicists, and engineers to form Project Superpressure, an effort to synthesize diamonds in the lab. General Electric, the industrial conglomerate founded by the inventor Thomas Edison, had a strong tradition of industrial research and the cost of importing diamonds, used to draw out the tungsten filament wire in light bulbs, was a serious concern. To support its research, General Electric commissioned a hydraulic press that cost $125,000,<!-- --><sup id="ref-4"></sup> stood two storeys high, and was capable of pressing 1,000 tons.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Four years of intense experimentation followed, during which Project Superpressure exhausted all of its original research budget and two additional funding allocations. On the third occasion that the project manager asked for more money, General Electric’s research managers, having seen no tangible results and skeptical of future success, almost unanimously voted to discontinue their support. Guy Suits, General Electric’s director of research, overruled them and approved the funds. Shortly after, Project Superpressure would make its breakthrough.</p>



<!-- --><p>On 16 December 1954 chemist and Project Superpressure team member Howard Tracy Hall placed two diamond seed crystals into a graphite tube with iron sulfide, capped with tantalum disks. The tube’s graphite would act both as a carbon source and, when electric current was applied to the tantalum disks, a resistance heater.<!-- --><sup id="ref-5"></sup> He then placed this cylindrical device into a pressure chamber of his own design. Hall’s pressure chamber, now known as a belt press, consisted of two opposing tapered anvils that compressed the reaction cell from above and below, with the sides supported by prestressed steel bands.<!-- --></p>

<!-- --><p>Hall describes how when he envisioned this device, his colleagues ‘felt negatively about it’. His proposal to build a prototype, which would have cost General Electric less than $1,000,<!-- --><sup id="ref-6"></sup> was rejected and he was refused time in the machine shop to build it. ‘I fretted about this for a time’, <!-- --><a href="https://legacybk.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/HTH-Archives/Tracy">he wrote</a>, ‘and then decided on a sub-rosa solution. Friends in the machine shop agreed to build the Belt, unofficially, on slack time. This took several months. Ordinarily, it would have taken only a week.’<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>A practicing Mormon, whose church and large family left him little time to socialize with his colleagues, Hall attri­buted the refusal to build his design and other slights to religious prejudice. When his prototype belt apparatus proved capable of attaining high pressures and high temperatures, Hall requested that its critical components be reconstructed in carboloy (cobalt-cemented tungsten carbide). Once again, his request was refused and it was not until his former supervisor intervened that he obtained permission to buy the carbide components.</p>



<!-- --><p>To further compound Hall’s sense of injustice, demand for Project Superpressure’s thousand-ton press was so high that Hall’s improved pressure chamber was ‘relegated’ (in his words) to an ‘ancient’ press, dating from the turn of the twentieth century, that was only capable of pressing 400 tons and still ran on water pressure.<!-- --><sup id="ref-7"></sup> Hall would later describe how this press ‘leaked so badly that rubber footwear, mop, and bucket were standard accessory equipment’.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Using this antique press, Hall managed to compress his pressure chamber to ten gigapascals (about 100,000 times the pressure of the atmosphere) and to heat the reaction chamber to 1,600°C. The experiment ran for 38 minutes. Hall <!-- --><a href="https://legacybk.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/HTH-Archives/Tracy">had created diamonds</a>:<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>I broke open a sample cell after removing it from the Belt. It cleaved near a tantalum disk used to bring in current for resistance heating. My hands began to tremble; my heart beat rapidly; my knees weakened and no longer gave support. My eyes had caught the flashing light from dozens of tiny triangular faces of octahedral crystals that were stuck to the tantalum and I knew that diamonds had finally been made by man.</p>



<!-- --><p>General Electric reproduced Hall’s results 20 times over the next two weeks and on 15 February 1955 announced to the rest of the world that it had created the first diamonds in the lab. In its press release, it implied that the diamonds had been created in their new thousand-ton press. Hall’s reward was a modest salary increase – from $10,000 to $11,000 per year – and a ten-dollar savings bond. He resigned from General Electric to become a full professor at Brigham Young University.</p>



<!-- --><p>The diamonds that Hall’s process produced were tiny, measuring a few thousandths of a millimeter in diameter: just enough to glint. Diamonds of this size are too small for jewelry, but extremely useful in industry – at the time, they were (and still are) used for sawing, grinding, and polishing metal, drawing wire, and stamping precision components. General Electric’s industrial diamonds initially cost more than mined diamonds, but they quickly proved to be superior. Unlike in nature, the diamonds’ growth was precisely managed, and their shape and regularity could be made to order.</p>



<!-- --><p>Hall, meanwhile, was forbidden from disclosing details about the belt press he invented, or using it to pursue further research into high-pressure chemistry, because of a secrecy order imposed by the United States Department of Commerce. During the Second World War, the supply of diamonds had been a source of anxiety for both the Allied and Axis powers. The United States, which did not have a domestic supply of diamonds, was dependent on the De Beers cartel for the diamonds necessary for its industrial production, and the business model of De Beers was to drive up prices by artificially restricting the world’s supply.</p>



<!-- --><p>A 1944 memorandum to the United States attorney general declared that ‘the United States is paying monopoly prices for an essential material needed in wartime production’ and that if De Beers were an American company ‘there would be no question’ that it had violated antitrust laws. De Beers was headquartered in London and did not maintain a presence in the United States, so there was little the Justice Department could do. In an effort to maintain American technological superiority during the Cold War, the Commerce Department desired to prevent other countries from obtaining diamond-making technology, even if it meant restricting research within the United States too.</p>



<!-- --><p>Hall attempted to get around this problem by designing a better press. The belt press invented at General Electric transmitted pressure to the reaction cell on one axis only; he determined it could be improved by applying pressure from multiple directions. In 1957, Hall built a tetrahedral press that consisted of four triangular-faced anvils that pressured each of the sides of a tetrahedral reaction cell, and submitted <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1716172">a paper describing its design</a> to the <!-- --><em>Review of Scientific Instruments</em>.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>The Commerce Department placed a secrecy order on this design too and Hall was obligated to write to every person who had seen the tetrahedral press or requested a description of the device to inform them of this directive. ‘In exasperation, I considered giving up the field of high pressure’, <!-- --><a href="https://legacybk.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/HTH-Archives/Tracy">Hall would later write</a>. Many of the scientists to whom Hall communicated this directive thought the secrecy order was outrageous and complained to the Commerce Department. Other government agencies agreed and soon after, the Defense Department ordered the Commerce Department to abandon the secrecy orders on the belt and tetrahedral presses.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>The tetrahedral press was an improvement on the belt press, but more efficient still was the cubic press, which Hall, like other industrialists making diamonds around the same time, would find more practical. A cubic press uses six hydraulically powered anvils to put pressure on the six faces of a cubic reaction cell from each side. Compared to a tetrahedron, a cube has a smaller surface area to volume ratio. Because pressure is force divided by area, this means that the cubic press can achieve the pressures required to grow diamonds with less force.</p>

A compact pressure pump injects hydraulic oil into the reservoir, pressuring the sphere from all directions at once. This causes the anvils to squeeze together, magnifying the pressure transmitted to the reaction cell at the center of the sphere (as the force is concentrated onto a smaller area). A graphite heater in the reaction cell provides the necessary heat.<!-- --></p>

<!-- --><p>Though the belt press, the cubic press, and the split-sphere apparatus have different pressure-delivery mechanisms, <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.2138/rmg.2022.88.13">the chemical reaction that occurs in the high-pressure cell</a> is the same: graphite is converted into diamond under high pressure and high temperature, catalyzed by a metal solvent and a small diamond ‘seed’ on which the new diamond precipitates.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Carbon atoms have four electrons in their outermost shell. At low pressures and temperatures, graphite – a solid that consists of two-dimensional sheets – is the most stable phase of carbon. In graphite, each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three other carbon atoms; the fourth electron is delocalized and free to conduct electricity. Graphite sheets are weakly held together by van der Waals forces: repulsions and attractions caused by fluctuations in the electron density of each atom.</p>

<!-- --><p>Under high pressure, diamond is the most stable form of carbon: each carbon atom is covalently bonded to four others, creating a tightly packed three-dimensional lattice. However, because the binding energy between carbon atoms is high, to convert graphite to diamond requires high temperatures.<!-- --><sup id="ref-9"></sup> When graphite is heated to 3,000°C under 15 gigapascals of pressure, its molecular structure changes to the tetrahedral shape characteristic of diamonds within seconds. Maintaining an even temperature and pressure is difficult under these conditions and so the diamonds produced tend to be small – measuring, at most, a few millimeters – and gritty. The cost of the equipment required to produce the necessary heat and pressure is prohibitively expensive.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Diamond makers use metal solvent catalysts to reduce the pressure and temperature required. In the reaction cell, diamond seeds, graphite, and a transition metal solvent such as iron are heated to 1,300°C–1,800°C and five to seven gigapascals of pressure are applied. The molten metal dissolves the graphite, breaking it down into individual carbon atoms.</p>



<!-- --><p>At high temperatures, the metal dissolves more carbon atoms. When the temperature falls, this is reversed: the carbon atoms are now supersaturated in the solvent and some of them precipitate out. Diamond manufacturers deliberately encourage this process by keeping the diamond seeds at a lower temperature than the metal, so that carbon atoms precipitate on their surface, growing them into larger diamonds. This process takes weeks, but compared to direct synthesis it is easier to control. The diamonds produced are larger and purer and have a more consistent, single-crystal structure.</p>

<!-- --><p>When making diamonds in a lab, <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.2138/rmg.2022.88.13">the most common impurities</a> to control are nitrogen and boron. These elements sit on either side of carbon on the periodic table and, being roughly the same size, are easily incorporated into a diamond’s lattice. Nitrogen colors diamonds yellow; boron colors them blue. Both are ubiquitous in the Earth and in the lab and it is difficult to exclude them from the carbon source, the metal solvent, and the reaction cell’s components. To stop nitrogen and boron from being absorbed into the diamond, manufacturers use chemical absorbers (called <!-- --><em>getters</em>) that react with them. Aluminum, titanium, and zirconium are common choices for both elements. When people want yellow or blue diamonds, nitrogen or boron can easily be added during production.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Pink diamonds need a few more steps. They are produced by introducing nitrogen into the reaction, irradiating the resulting yellow or brown diamond, and then heating the diamond. This process causes the lattice to rearrange itself so that, throughout the diamond, single nitrogen atoms are located next to single gaps in the lattice. These defects are called nitrogen-vacancy centers and they produce a pink hue. In quantum computing, pink diamonds have been proposed as <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-00742-4">a means of storing and manipulating quantum information at room temperature</a>.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>While diamonds were first produced in the lab in the 1950s, until the 2010s they were too small and too impure for jewelry. What made gem-quality lab diamonds possible was the meticulous investigation of the behavior of carbon at high pressures and high temperatures, a better understanding of the role of catalysts and getters, more precise control of the temperature gradients in the reaction cell, and competition from a new method of manufacturing diamonds.</p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>Chemical vapor deposition</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>During the 1950s, while Project Superpressure was recreating the high-pressure, high-temperature conditions under which diamonds form in the Earth, scientists at industrial laboratories in the United States and at the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in Moscow investigated a different technique for producing diamonds, not inspired by nature: chemical vapor deposition.</p>



<!-- --><p>With chemical vapor deposition, a solid material is deposited from a vapor that is undergoing a chemical reaction. As a manufacturing technique, it is as old as the cavemen, who would use soot from combustion for painting. To make diamonds using this process requires heating carbon to such a high temperature that it becomes a gas of isolated atoms, and then coaxing it to crystallize into a diamond structure as it cools.</p>



<!-- --><p>Graphite is the most thermodynamically stable phase of carbon at low pressures, but it is only slightly more stable than diamond. Because of this, whether the carbon gas con­denses as diamond or graphite hinges on how fast the diamond and graphite crystals form and grow.</p>



<!-- --><p>The first successful effort to produce diamonds using chemical vapor deposition occurred at Union Carbide. According to a <!-- --><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3030187A/en">patent application</a> filed by research scientist William Eversole in 1958, when a carbon-containing gas (either methane, CH<!-- --><sub>4</sub>, or carbon monoxide, CO) is heated to 900–1,100 degrees celsius at low pressure in the presence of diamond seed crystals, ‘diamond is deposited at a much faster rate than is black carbon [i.e., graphite]’. At the time, this was surprising. As the patent explains, ‘This is unexpected in view of the fact that thermodynamically, graphite is more stable than diamond’.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Periodically, the diamonds had to be cleaned: further growth would be ‘hampered by the accumulation of black carbon’. This could be done by exposing the diamonds to hot, pressurized hydrogen (H<!-- --><sub>2</sub>), which removes graphite faster than it removes carbon.<!-- --><sup id="ref-10"></sup> Unfortunately, the rate of diamond growth in this initial discovery (~0.01 micrometers per hour) was extremely slow and so the process could not be commercialized.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>In the 1960s, the American chemist John Angus started an experimental program to investigate chemical vapor deposition diamond synthesis at Case Western Reserve University. Angus <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diamond.2014.08.004">recounts</a> that ‘the anonymous [National Science Foundation] reviewers were often scathing in their assessment of low-pressure diamond synthesis proposals, usually based on a misapplication of the second law of thermodynamics’ but the Defense Department were more sympathetic to high-risk proposals, ‘especially if they included, “The Russians are doing it”’.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>In their experiments, both the Soviets and the Americans were forced to alternate diamond growth cycles with graphite-cleaning cycles. Angus’s group found that if they broke the H<!-- --><sub>2</sub> used in cleaning into atomic hydrogen, the reaction proceeded much faster. At a conference in Ukraine in 1971, John Angus discussed these results with the Russian chemist Boris Derjaguin. Shortly after, the Soviets stopped publishing.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>What the Soviets discovered was that by using atomic hydrogen during the growth phase, they could inhibit the formation of graphite in the first place. Furthermore, the hydrogen gasified and thus removed any graphite that did manage to form. This both eliminated the need for a separate cleaning phase and accelerated diamond growth. While the Soviets would publish this result in <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00923350">1978</a> and <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0248(81)90197-4">1981</a>, national security considerations prevented them from describing their experimental setup in sufficient detail for others to replicate their results.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Despite this secrecy, the results of these experiments attracted the attention of scientists at the Japanese National Institute for Research in Inorganic Materials, who began an intensive program of research into the role of atomic hydrogen in the chemical vapor deposition synthesis of diamonds. Using hot tungsten filaments, microwaves, and electric arcs to break hydrogen gas (H<!-- --><sub>2</sub>) into atomic hydrogen (H), these researchers – principally Mutsukazu Kamo, Seiichiro Matsumoto, and Yoichiro Sato – discovered how to grow diamonds at rates of several micrometers per hour, two orders of magnitude faster than Eversole.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Crucially, this research was done in the open: the growth methods were published in sufficient detail that other scientists could easily reproduce and extend their work, and the laboratory welcomed visitors. A large number of companies, universities, and research institutes in Japan, the United States, and Europe entered the field. Having been dismissed as being physically impossible two decades before, the manufacturing of diamonds using chemical vapor deposition had become the subject of intense research and development worldwide.</p>

<!-- --><p>In <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.2138/rmg.2022.88.13">a modern chemical vapor deposition reactor</a>, multiple diamond seeds are placed in a vacuum chamber with the reactant gasses – mostly hydrogen (H<!-- --><sub>2</sub>) and a small amount (generally less than one percent) of methane (CH<!-- --><sub>4</sub>). The diamond seeds are heated to 800°C–1,200°C. Microwaves are then used to heat the hydrogen gas (H<!-- --><sub>2</sub>) to 2,000°C–5,000°C, breaking its molecules into atomic hydrogen (H).<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Some of these unpaired hydrogen atoms will react with the carbon atoms on the surface of the diamond, creating a hydrogen-terminated surface that prevents the diamond crystal from reconstructing itself as graphite.<!-- --><sup id="ref-11"></sup> However, because other unpaired hydrogen atoms will also abstract hydrogen from the diamond’s surface, not all of the carbon atoms will be terminated, leaving sites for other carbon atoms to be added.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>At the same time, atomic hydrogen will react with the methane, stripping away a hydrogen atom and leaving behind a methyl radical (CH<!-- --><sub>4</sub> + H → CH<!-- --><sub>3</sub> + H<!-- --><sub>2</sub>). The carbon atom in the methyl radical (CH<!-- --><sub>3</sub>) contains an unpaired electron. Some of these methyl radicals will react with unterminated carbon atoms on the diamond’s surface, growing it. The length of time required depends on the intended size; for gem-sized diamonds, it can take several weeks.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>A major advantage of chemical vapor deposition is that the reaction chamber is not subject to extreme pressure, and so the formation of the diamond is easier to monitor and to control. Chemical vapor deposition reactors are also less capital intensive than the presses required for high-pressure, high-temperature synthesis.</p>



<!-- --><p>Manufacturers can engineer chemical vapor deposition diamonds to precise physical, mechanical, thermal, and optical specifications by varying the temperature, pressure, and duration of the reaction and by adding desired impurities to the reactant gas. Improvements such as slightly increasing the pressure in the reaction chamber, using higher-powered microwaves, and adding a small amount of nitrogen and oxygen to the catalyst have made it possible to grow large, gem-quality diamonds.</p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>Identifying a lab diamond</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>In their pure form, lab diamonds and mined diamonds are physically, chemically, and optically identical. Both consist of three-dimensional lattices of carbon atoms. To tell them apart, trained gemologists look carefully for <!-- --><a href="https://www.gia.edu/hpht-and-cvd-diamond-growth-processes">impurities included during their formation</a>, and for <!-- --><a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/msa/rimg/article/88/1/689/614940/Synthesis-of-Diamonds-and-Their-Identification">growth patterns that provide clues about their development</a>. Diamond-manufacturing technology has become so good that lab diamonds can be made to be purer than diamonds formed in the Earth. At the upper end of the market, it is not pos­sible to tell the difference between lab diamonds and mined diamonds with the naked eye.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Mined diamonds almost always contain nitrogen. In large quantities, this colors them yellow or brown; for colorless diamonds, this impurity can be detected using an optical spectrometer. Nitrogen-free diamonds that are formed in the Earth are extremely rare, and expensive. Conversely, nitrogen is almost always excluded from lab-grown diamonds.</p>



<!-- --><p>High-pressure, high-temperature diamonds can include traces of the metallic catalysts used to make them, particularly if the reaction is not carefully controlled. These can be identified using a microscope, and at high concentrations, iron and cobalt impurities can even be detected using a strong magnet. Chemical vapor deposition diamonds sometimes incorporate graphite, which appear as little pinpricks, comets, or flat clouds.</p>



<!-- --><p>High-pressure, high-temperature diamonds are subject to roughly uniform pressure during manufacturing, leading them to grow in both the cubic and octahedral directions. Even after being cut and polished, some evidence of these growth directions remains in the form of tiny grain lines. Chemical vapor deposition diamonds, deposited layer by layer, are cubic in form. Diamonds produced in the Earth are subject to uneven pressure; most end up octahedral, though some are also cubic or irregular.</p>

<!-- --><p>Because it’s so difficult to distinguish between mined and lab diamonds (even for jewelers), diamond grading institutions inscribe <!-- --><em>LG</em> or <!-- --><em>Laboratory-Grown</em> on the rim of lab-grown diamonds, visible at 20-times magnification.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>The future of jewelry</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>The tradition that diamonds are an integral part of an engagement proposal is the result of <!-- --><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/past/issues/82feb/8202diamond1.htm">a highly successful advertising campaign</a> by the De Beers cartel. During the Great Depression, diamond sales slumped. De Beers responded by enlisting Hollywood actors and socialites in a campaign to associate diamond rings with marriage proposals, commissioning portraits of them showing off their new engagement rings, and by running ads showing happy young couples honeymooning above the now-famous slogan ‘A Diamond Is Forever’. In time, it also tried to persuade men that they would need to spend <!-- --><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27371208">a fixed proportion of their income</a> on a stone to win at love. One later advert, from the 1980s, was captioned ‘2 months’ salary showed the future Mrs Smith what the future would be like’.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>De Beers’s campaign <!-- --><a href="https://meltingasphalt.com/ads-dont-work-that-way/">worked</a> because people desire signifiers of commitment that are credible and socially sanctioned. Diamond engagement rings suit this purpose because they are beautiful and practical and their symbolism is well-known. While the mine owners benefited most from this arrangement, the high price was a costly – and therefore credible – signal of wealth and commitment and, in an era where this mattered, <!-- --><a href="https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/law_faculty_scholarship/576/">insurance against breach of promise to marry</a>. Peer pressure and status anxiety reinforced this norm.<!-- --></p>



    <!-- --><figure>
        <!-- -->
    <!-- --></figure>




<!-- --><p>Lab diamonds have destroyed this equilibrium. Competition among diamond manufacturers and technological progress in diamond making mean that lab diamonds are indistinguishable from mined diamonds, but cost much, much less – and the price is falling. In 2016, a one-carat near-colorless and very slightly included round brilliant lab-grown diamond cost $5,440, according to diamond analyst <!-- --><a href="https://www.paulzimnisky.com/">Paul Zimnisky</a>; in 2024, the same stone cost $1,325. (The price of an equivalent mined diamond decreased from $6,538 to $5,035.) In the past few years, sales of lab diamonds have started to overtake mined diamonds. A <!-- --><a href="https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-data-insights/real-weddings-study">survey by The Knot of nearly 10,000 couples married in 2023</a> revealed that lab diamonds accounted for 46 percent of engagement rings (compared with 39 percent who opted for a mined diamond), up from 12 percent in 2019.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Diamonds will continue to symbolize engagement – the tradition is now well established – but on its own, the raw material will cease to be a symbol of wealth or sacrifice. Lab diamonds can already be made to be clearer and more colorless than mined diamonds – or, if the wearer desires it, to have a more magnificent color. To complement this, consumers are demanding better workmanship in the cutting and polishing of the stone and in the <!-- --><a href="https://www.nigeloreilly.com/">design and manufacturing of its setting</a>.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>The <!-- --><a href="https://www.igi.org/gemblog/what-are-hearts-arrows-diamonds/">‘hearts and arrows’</a> optical pattern, which is present only in round brilliant diamonds that are perfectly cut, is a good example of this trend. Previously, perfectly cut diamonds were extremely rare, and too expensive for most customers. Now, because of strong demand, the International Gemological Institute has begun to note the presence of the hearts and arrows pattern on their <!-- --><a href="https://www.igi.org/reports/hearts-arrows">diamond grading certificates</a>.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>As lab diamonds can be engineered to be more beautiful than mined diamonds, we should expect them to be used more often in fine jewelry. Lab diamonds won’t end conspicuous consumption, but it will be the consumer and not the mine owners who enjoy most of the benefits.</p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>Diamonds in industry</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>While the beauty of diamonds has made them synonymous with jewelry, most diamonds, mined or lab-grown, are produced for industrial use. Diamonds have excellent physical, optical, thermal, chemical, mechanical, and electrical properties, which makes them useful in manufacturing, construction, mining, medicine, electronics, and other industries. Mined diamonds, being too impure, do not perform as well as lab diamonds when used for industrial purposes. Moreover, lab diamonds can be manufactured to required specifications more reliably and cheaply. In industry, lab-grown diamonds have eclipsed mined diamonds for several decades, and improvements in diamond-manufacturing technology are spurring progress in other fields.</p>

<!-- --><p>Polycrystalline diamond drill bits, made by fusing together diamond grit under high pressure and high temperature, are indispensable in oil and gas drilling, where they are stronger, faster, and more durable than tungsten carbide, the best alternative. Oil and gas wells often need to be drilled several kilometers deep, and replacing a broken or worn drill bit is a time-consuming process that requires pulling up and breaking apart the entire drill string. Using diamond-tipped drill bits has reduced the need for these replacements, saving money. There are some particularly hard rock formations that would be impossible to drill without them.</p>



<!-- --><p>Because of their strength, durability, and precision, diamond-tipped drill bits are also used to drill into glass, masonry, ceramics, and teeth. Other applications of diamond that make use of its hardness include grinding and polishing concrete, granite, and marble; <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_drawing">drawing wire</a>; and coating other materials to make them more hard-wearing. As materials science advances and creates tougher alloys, polymers, ceramics, and composites, it is almost certain that diamond tools will be needed to cut and shape them.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>As an optical material, diamonds have tremendous potential, because they are transparent, dissipate heat quickly, and do not expand much at high temperatures. In particular, diamonds are useful in high-powered lasers, which are used in cutting, welding, sensing, ignition, and medical surgery. A major problem with existing high-powered lasers is that their components are damaged by or deteriorate under high heat, limiting their output. An example of this is the <!-- --><a href="https://www.rp-photonics.com/thermal_lensing.html">thermal lensing</a> effect, where high and uneven temperatures change how the optical window of the laser bends light. This degrades the focus and alignment of the laser beam. Diamond, however, is an excellent window material, being a good conductor of heat and transmitter of light and having a refractive index that does not vary much with temperature. Diamonds can also be used as heat spreaders to cool down other components in lasers, increasing the maximum power that can be generated.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>An ongoing area of research is the use of diamonds as the active laser medium: the component that optically amplifies light. To do this will require diamonds that are larger, purer, and more structurally perfect than what nature can provide and so will depend on advances in diamond-manufacturing technology.</p>



<!-- --><p>Even more promising, diamond has the potential to be an <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ma14227081">excellent semiconductor</a>. Diamond has excellent thermal conductivity, because the regularity of its lattice and the strength of its bonds enable heat to be transferred quickly and efficiently. It has a wide band gap – in other words, it requires a high (but not insurmountable) amount of energy to promote one of its electrons into the conduction band. This means diamond can handle higher temperatures and voltages than conventional semiconductors, making it useful not only in devices that operate in extreme conditions (such as engines, radio towers, drilling equipment, spacecrafts, solar panels, and the electricity grid) but also for increasing microchip performance more generally.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Most microchips today are made from silicon, a metalloid that sits one row below carbon on the periodic table and has a thermal conductivity of 1.5 watts per centimeter-kelvin. Diamond, by contrast, has a thermal conductivity of 22 watts per centimeter-kelvin. Over the past five decades, the number of transistors on a microchip has increased <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">at an exponential rate</a>, while the microchips themselves have become smaller. Chip designers have therefore had to contend with the ever-increasing problem of dissipating the heat that is generated. <!-- --><a href="https://semiengineering.com/the-rising-price-of-power-in-chips">Heat degrades the performance of microchips</a> and limits how tightly transistors can be packed together.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>To overcome this problem, manufacturers have lowered the voltage and devoted a large amount of space and energy to cooling and ventilation systems. Because diamond dissipates heat much faster than silicon, diamond-based microchips can be made smaller and operate in more extreme temperatures. On existing silicon-based microchips, diamonds are already being used as heat spreaders.</p>



<!-- --><p>Diamond also has a wider band gap than silicon (5.45 electron volts vs. 1.1 electron volts) and consequently diamond microchips can operate at higher voltages than silicon microchips. Semiconductors are engineered to precisely control the flow of electricity, but above a certain voltage their electrical resistance breaks down, resulting in an uncontrolled flow of current. Diamond undergoes electrical breakdown at ten millivolts per centimeter, compared to 0.3 for silicon, making it more suitable for high-voltage applications such as power generation and distribution. Furthermore, for a given voltage, less material is needed and so diamond microchips can be made to be smaller.</p>



<!-- --><p>Compared to other wide band gap semiconductors, electrons and electron holes<!-- --><sup id="ref-13"></sup> move quickly through diamonds. This is important, because it means that signals are transported through diamonds faster. A conservative estimate places diamond’s electron and electron hole mobilities at 1,000 cm<!-- --><sup>2</sup>/Vs (square centimeters per volt-second) and 2,000 cm<!-- --><sup>2</sup>/Vs respectively, but <!-- --><a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1074374">electron mobilities as high as 4,500 cm<!-- --><sup>2</sup>/Vs and hole mobilities as high as 3,800 cm<!-- --><sup>2</sup>/Vs have been reported<!-- --></a>. Silicon, for comparison, has an electron mobility of 1,500 cm<!-- --><sup>2</sup>/Vs and a hole mobility of 480 cm<!-- --><sup>2</sup>/Vs.<!-- --></p>



    <!-- --><figure>
        <!-- -->

<!-- --><p>Before diamonds can be used in semiconductors, we’ll have to overcome a number of technical challenges. The cost is, at present, prohibitive (despite recent advances, diamond is still about <!-- --><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/this-diamond-transistor-is-still-raw-but-its-future-looks-bright">10,000 times more expensive than silicon</a>) and the diamond substrates required are larger than what can currently be made. Microchips are manufactured from extremely pure, single-crystal wafers, which are thin slices of semiconductor material. While semiconductor fabrication plants can manufacture silicon wafers to have diameters of up to 300 millimeters, at present diamond wafers are limited to ten millimeters if manufactured using the high-pressure, high-temperature process. Chemical vapor deposition diamond wafers can be made slightly larger, but the number of defects in the diamond and hence its utility as a semiconductor is typically worse.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>A more pressing problem is doping (that is, deliberately adding impurities to) the diamond to have the required electrical properties. In its pure form diamond is an electrical insulator. To use it as a semiconductor requires incorporating electron-donating impurities, to create an n-type semiconductor, or electron-accepting impurities, to create a p-type semiconductor.</p>



<!-- --><p>Creating a p-type diamond semiconductor is not hard: boron, the element to the left of carbon in the periodic table, has one fewer electron and hence is electron-accepting. When introduced as an impurity during the diamond-manufacturing process it is readily incorporated into the diamond’s lattice.</p>



<!-- --><p>Creating an n-type diamond semiconductor is harder. While nitrogen, the element to the right of carbon in the periodic table, has one surplus electron, <!-- --><a href="https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/j.p.goss/Research/NtypeDiamond/">the energy required to release this electron to the conduction band is extremely high</a>. Phosphorus, which is one period below nitrogen, is a more promising candidate, but because phosphorus is larger than carbon, incorporating it into the tightly packed diamond lattice is not easy. The energy required to release the surplus phosphorus electron is also high, though the situation is not as bad as it was with nitrogen. When such an n-type diamond semiconductor is used at high temperatures, this is less of a problem, as the required activation energy is readily available. However, for semiconductors intended to be used at room temperature, a more suitable electron donor must be found. This is an open problem.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>Not unconquerable</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>Nature takes billions of years to produce diamonds. Deep in the Earth’s mantle, the intense heat and high pressure slowly crystallizes carbon-containing fluids into diamonds. Volcanic eruptions transport these diamonds to the surface. Mining them is a dirty business – diesel-powered diggers excavate <!-- --><a href="https://www.imperial-consultants.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Final-report-Environmental-Impacts-of-Mined-Diamonds.pdf#page=19">1,000 tons of earth for every carat that is dug out of the ground</a>. Most mined diamonds are ugly, discolored, and impure.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>In the lab, diamonds can be made to be purer, more beautiful, and more durable than what nature can achieve in less time and with fewer resources. If desired, specific impurities can be added to modify their optical, mechanical, and electrical properties. Initially, lab diamonds were manufactured using the high-pressure, high-temperature process, which was inspired by the method by which diamonds form in the Earth. Now they are also made using chemical vapor deposition, which has never been observed in nature.</p>



<!-- --><p>In Western civilization, a pernicious belief has taken hold, that what is ‘natural’ is good and what is man-made is inferior or harmful. Wordsworth, in his poem ‘<!-- --><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45557/the-tables-turned">The Tables Turned</a>’, expresses it best:<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><blockquote><p>Sweet is the lore which nature brings</p><p>Our meddling intellect </p><p>Mis-shapes the beauteous forms of things: — </p><p>We murder to dissect.</p></blockquote>



<!-- --><p>But human intellect and the scientific method are the foundations of our prosperity. Nature is not a superior craftsman: it is our resource, and we can and should improve upon it.</p>



<!-- --><p>In materials science, this has been obvious for a long time: steel, plastic, <!-- --><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/how-polyester-bounced-back/">polyester</a>, concrete, ceramics, and glass are unsurpassed by any natural substance.

<h2>America's best-paid CEOs have the worst-paid employees (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/09/09/low-wage-100/#executive-excess">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>Broadly speaking, the role of an establishment economist is to come up with new ways of saying, "actually, your boss is right." In other words, the world we're living in is the best possible world, and the fact that you got contact burns from collapsing on the scorching sidewalk outside of the grocery store where you couldn't afford your weekly shopping is unfortunate, but unavoidable.</p>
<p>I once had an economist send me an email to explain how misguided it was to focus on executive pay. Sure (he wrote), executives might be taking home eye-popping sums, but these weren't really coming at the expense of their workers' wellbeing. Just do the math: take those whopping CEO pay-packages and parcel them out to the hundreds of thousands of workers at Fortune 100 companies, and you'll find that each worker's paycheck is just a few dollars larger. Hacking away at CEO pay is an act of spite, not justice.</p>
<p>Meanwhile (the economist continued), just look at where those giant paydays are coming from: stock grants, not salaries. In the bad old days, CEOs' millions came in the form of cash. That incentivized short-term thinking, since anything the CEO did to goose the quarterly numbers would translate into a cash bonus, even if it set the company up for failure in the years to come. But if a CEO's payout comes long after their decisions – if their stock grants don't vest for three or four years – then the CEO's incentives are aligned with long-term sustainability, which is good for everyone.</p>
<p>It's all nonsense, of course – every bit of it.</p>
<p>Take the question of whether controlling CEO pay is useful as a matter separate from the impact it has on workers' wages. In our society, money is power, and the more money any individual is allowed to amass, the more power they amass. This power is then mobilized to acquire more money, and thus more power. Before you know it, the ultrawealthy are perverting every democratic institution we have. They buy the Supreme Court:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/06/clarence-thomas/#harlan-crow">https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/06/clarence-thomas/#harlan-crow</a></p>
<p>They fill our elite universities with their doltish offspring:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/18/bipartisan-consensus/#meritocracy">https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/18/bipartisan-consensus/#meritocracy</a></p>
<p>They set the planet on fire:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/09/04/deferred-gratification/#selective-foresight">https://pluralistic.net/2024/09/04/deferred-gratification/#selective-foresight</a></p>
<p>And they bankroll fascists:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/02/plunderers/#farben">https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/02/plunderers/#farben</a></p>
<p>So even if controlling wealth acquisition had <em>no</em> impact on workers' wages, it would be worth doing. But of course, cutting executive pay <em>does</em> have an impact on workers' wages. It's true that simply dividing a CEO's pay among their workforce yields pennies, but that's the wrong way to do the math (and economists know it).</p>
<p>Every year, the Institute for Policy Studies publishes a report called "Executive Excess," in which they track the gap between the compensation offered to corporate leaders and to the workers who generate all that money. This year's is a banger:</p>
<p><a href="https://ips-dc.org/report-executive-excess-2024/">https://ips-dc.org/report-executive-excess-2024/</a></p>
<p>The report zeroes in on one weird trick that CEOs use to goose their compensation: stock buybacks. Buybacks are an illegal form of stock manipulation that is nevertheless widely practiced, thanks to the SEC's policy of stretching Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to creates a "safe harbor" for conduct that violates the plain language of the SEA.</p>
<p>Stock buybacks divert a company's profits to buy its own shares on the open market, reducing the supply of outstanding shares, which makes each outstanding share worth more. Say a company is worth a billion dollars and has issued a million shares. Each of those shares is worth $1,000 (because $1,000 times one million is $1 billion). The company uses its profits to buy half of those shares, so now the remaining 500,000 shares are worth $2,000 ($2,000 times 500,000 is $1 billion).</p>
<p>So stock buybacks increase the value of a company's shares – <em>without</em> increasing the value of the company. This is the opposite of the notional goal of paying CEOs with shares (long-term sustainability). Companies that buy back their own stock do so at the expense of R&amp;D, or competitive price-cutting, or (of course) paying their employees more. Unlike a dividend – in which companies pay shareholders some of their profits directly – buybacks manipulate the price of shares directly.</p>
<p>Why would CEOs prefer buybacks to dividends? Because CEOs sit on <em>tons</em> of shares. Even if only some of those shares have vested, a CEO who uses this ruse to increase share prices can cash those shares out, borrow against the rest, <em>and</em> count on a big stock grant from shareholders who are grateful for their windfall.</p>
<p>That means that the <em>true</em> cost of a CEO pay package isn't the value of the shares they're awarded – it's the cost of the stock buyback that leads to that award. And this is where the numbers get truly, obscenely, <em>huge</em>.</p>
<p>Take Lowe's: over the past five years, CEO Marvin Ellison spent <em>$43 billion</em> on stock buybacks, netting $18 million for himself in the process. Now, Lowe's has 285,000 employees, half of whom earn less than $33,000/year. Divide Ellison's $18m among those workers and each of them would net a paltry $126/year. But if you were to share out the $43 billion Ellison had to piss up against a wall on stock buybacks among those workers, you'd be able to give <em>every worker a $30,000 bonus, every year</em>:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2024/09/02/the-low-wage-corporations-that-blew-half-a-trillion-dollars-to-inflate-ceo-pay/">https://www.counterpunch.org/2024/09/02/the-low-wage-corporations-that-blew-half-a-trillion-dollars-to-inflate-ceo-pay/</a></p>
<p>Lowe's leads the "Low-Wage 100," IPS's index of the worst paying 100 companies out of the S&amp;P 500. Over the past five years, the Low-Wage 100 has spent more than <em>half a trillion dollars</em> on stock buybacks. As with other companies, the CEOs of the Low-Wage 100 timed mass sell-offs of their shares to coincide with the buybacks:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/speech-jackson-061118#_%20ftn22">https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/speech-jackson-061118#_%20ftn22</a></p>
<p>The largest 20 companies in the Low-Wage 100 spent nine times more on stock buybacks than they spent on worker retirement plan contributions. Chipotle spent $2b on buybacks – that's 48 times what the company put into its workers' 401(k)s. That's because 92% of Chipotle employees <em>can't afford to have a 401(k)</em>.</p>
<p>The economists who campaigned to pay CEOs in stock were wrong about nearly everything. CEO compensation <em>does</em> come at the expense of a living wage for workers, and it <em>doesn't</em> build sustainable businesses focused on long-term value. The billions that Boeing spent on buybacks are billions that Boeing <em>didn't</em> spend on airworthiness:</p>
<p><a href="https://ycharts.com/companies/BA/stock_buyback">https://ycharts.com/companies/BA/stock_buyback</a></p>
<p>But those economists were right about one thing: incentives matter. In incentivizing CEOs to keep share prices high above every other consideration, establishment economists set the stage for a corporate America where CEOs were punished for investing in a living wage, a dignified retirement, or even a non-lethal product. Instead, we have a business environment that boils down to a competition to see who can eat their seed-corn the fastest.</p>
<p>Contrary to those economists' insistence that this is the best possible outcome, this all represents a (disastrous) choice. Lowe's doesn't need stock buybacks to thrive: we know this because from 2000-2004, Lowe's spent <em>zero</em> dollars on stock buybacks. In that period, CEO pay ran about 40 times median worker pay. Today, Ross Stores CEO Barbara Rentle makes <em>2,100 times more</em> than her median employee.</p>
<p>What should we do about this? Well, for starters, the SEC should re-establish enforcement of the prohibition on stock buybacks and drop the absurd fiction that buybacks satisfy the safe harbor requirements of Rule 10b-18. We should end preferential tax treatment of capital gains, the money you get from owning something, which is taxed at a fraction of wages, the money you get from <em>doing</em> something. This would also have the side benefit of killing the "carried interest tax loophole," a rule designed for 16th century sea-captains (!!) that lets private equity looters duck billions in taxes:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/29/writers-must-be-paid/#carried-interest">https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/29/writers-must-be-paid/#carried-interest</a></p>
<p>On top of this, the IPS recommends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taxing stock buybacks (the 2024 Democratic platform proposes quadrupling the existing tax on buybacks);
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase taxes for excessive CEO pay (a rule already in place in San Francisco and Portland and proposed in several federal bills);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ban companies that have absurd pay gaps from doing business with the US government (something a sitting president can do at the stroke of a pen).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The transformation of economics into the "actually, your boss is right" machine has made vast fortunes for a tiny segment of the population. Even if you stipulate that this handful of oligarchs is no worse than any of us, they certainly aren't any <em>better</em> than us – and they've been incentivized to wreck our economy, our bodies, and our planet. But this isn't the only way to run an economics profession, which is why it's so exciting to see heterodox economics moving to the fore:</p>
